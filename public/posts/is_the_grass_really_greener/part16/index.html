It is for reference purposes only.]\nAnando Joachim. Anando means rejoice. Joachim means appointed by god.\nMan is not an accident. But that's what science still believes, that man is an accident. According to science everything is accidental; the world itself has no meaning, it has no inner unity, it is not an organic whole. It is just a chaos, and in the chaos things are happening but they are accidental, not intentional. That's the basic difference between the religious attitude and the scientific. Religion says the world is a cosmos, not a chaos, and whatsoever is happening is not accidental but intentional, that there is a purpose behind it, that there is an undercurrent of meaning holding everything together and that man is the most significant phenomenon.\nHence to say that man is accidental is to destroy all his joy. One cannot feel joyous if one is a mere accident. One will start feeling empty, rejected, not wanted, not needed. That's what is happening all around 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nthe world because of science: the modern man is feeling very miserable, sad, meaningless, and then once life starts losing meaning, sooner or later suicide remains the only way to get out of it.\nMan is coming, individually, socially, universally, closer and closer to suicide, Except through religion man cannot be saved. Man needs to feel meaningful; and it is not a question of inventing meaning, meaning is already there -- it has to be discovered. Once you discover some meaning in your life there is great rejoicing. You are needed by existence, you are not superfluous, you cannot be discarded like rubbish. You will be missed if you are not there, without you, something will be lacking.\nThat's the meaning of Joachim -- your being appointed by god means the universe intentionally wants you, the whole universe wants you. And it is not only the question of you; even a small blade of grass is as much needed as the greatest star. The very ordinary person is as much needed as any Albert Einstein. There is no hierarchy in existence. Existence is absolutely just, it treats everybody equally. Animals, birds, trees, planets, man -- all are joined together for a certain ultimate destiny.\nThe conscious search for that destiny is sannyas, the deliberate effort to discover the meaning of life is sannyas. Sannyas is the science of discovering meaning, significance.\nAnand Bela. Anand means bliss. Bela means beautiful.\nThe only thing really beautiful is blissfulness. And the only thing ugly is sadness, misery. But because the majority of human beings live in misery, they worship misery. They are afraid of bliss, they are afraid of blissful people. They cannot believe that somebody is really blissful, hence they deny the Buddhas, the Christs. The whole effort of the mob psychology is to say that such persons have never existed and if they exist it is better, immediately, to destroy them, because they create a disturbance in their minds. The disturbance is, \"If somebody is blissful that means that is my possibility too, and I am miserable, so I have to change myself, I have to go through a transformation, and that seems to be very arduous, an uphill task.\"\nIt is not coincidental that the awakened, the enlightened, the really beautiful\npeople, have always been mistreated by the mob. For the simple reason that they have become accustomed to their misery, to their ugliness and they don't want to encounter any mirror, they don't want to see their own faces. Rather than seeing their faces and seeing the ugliness, they would rather like to destroy the mirror. They will say, \"It is because of the mirror that we are looking ugly; the mirror is responsible. Destroy the mirror and we are perfectly okay as we have always been.\"\nBeautiful people have existed very rarely. To be beautiful is risky, dangerous, but the risk has to be taken, otherwise one misses the whole of life. It is better to live for a single moment in total bliss than to live a long life of misery. It is better to live in bliss and be crucified than to live in misery, carrying your own cross for the whole of your life; then life is pointless.\nMy sannyasins have to accept the challenge, they have to learn how to be blissful. That's my only work here, to help you to be blissful, to be beautiful, to attain to an inner harmony and grace; then whatsoever the cost, one has to pay it.\nHow long will you be here? How long will you be staying? I don't know.\nBe here. You seem to belong here! Good.\nAnand Hannes. Anand means bliss. Hannes means god's gracious gift.\nMisery is man's invention, bliss is a gift from the beyond, so if one stops creating misery one becomes blissful: the gift is always there. But we go on ignoring it. We are too occupied in creating our misery.\nContinuously, twenty-four hours a day, people are working hard, overtime, to create misery. They are doing great work. If you watch yourself you will understand what I mean (laughter). Nobody misses a single opportunity to be miserable And one cannot be both miserable and blissful together. If you are so full of misery and continuously creating it there is no space for bliss to enter you. It remains standing at the door.\nUnless you empty yourself of all misery it cannot enter.\nMeditation means emptying yourself of the misery that you have created in the\npast and not creating the same misery again.\nJust today I was reading the definition of a bachelors A bachelor is a person who has not committed the same mistake even once! (laughter)\nBut if you cannot be a bachelor, at least don't get married again, don't commit it twice. And there are people who are committing the same mistake millions of times. If a man is alert he can see all around what people are doing and that will be enough... but that much understanding is rare. But one can learn at least 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nfrom one's own experience. Reconsider what you have done to yourself in the past and you will see you have been wounding yourself. And you don't allow your wounds to heal; you go on opening them again and again, you go on scratching them again and again. Then slowly slowly it becomes just a mechanical habit, then one goes around in a vicious circle from one misery to another, and one becomes of course, more and more skilful. Whatsoever you do remember, you will become efficient in it, you will become an expert. And I have come across so many experts in creating misery that I sometimes wonder what people are doing with their lives. With the same energy, with the same effort, with the same commitment, they would have achieved the greatest bliss possible.\nAnd people are doing the work of creating misery so religiously, so devotedly, that if you want to stop them they won't listen to you.\nTo become a sannyasin means you have to stop your old patterns and you have to learn a new style of life. Start, even though you have to start from the very beginning; learn the ABC of cheerfulness, blissfulness and slowly slowly you will become an expert in that too.\nAnd the whole expertise in bliss is simple; the expertise in misery is very complex, it needs many people, it needs many things. It needs money, power, prestige, family, wife, husband, children -- thousands of things. It needs politics\nand the church, and political ideology and what not. One has to arrange a whole junkyard around oneself, then finally one succeeds in being miserable.\nBeing blissful needs nothing. You have just to be spacious, empty, and bliss starts pouring... yes, dogs and cats! It is not just a shower, it really pours! (laughter) Deva Prita. Deva means divine. Prita means love.\nLove is one of the most divine qualities. One can enter into God from many doors. Love is one of the doors and one of the most beautiful doors to enter into God because it is more aesthetic, more musical, more poetic.\nTruth is also a door but it is dry, desertlike, logical. There are people who may like to enter from the desert route -- that is their choice -- but when one can go through the garden path, with birds singing and flowers and fragrances, why unnecessarily go through a desert? If one is a masochist, if one enjoys torturing oneself, then it is another matter. But rarely are there people who would like to torture themselves. Even if they continue torturing themselves because they have been taught to, deep down they don't want it.\nEverybody would like to live a life in a beautiful way, in a sensitive way. Love is the most beautiful path towards God, but one has to go on purifying it.\nThe ordinary love is too full of jealousy, possessiveness, anger, hatred, domination, ego -- these are all enemies of love, these are parasites. As these parasites are removed, love starts becoming purer, more alive, more intense, total.\nFirst, love is a relationship, and then love is only a friendship. Then love is only a loving quality, and ultimately one becomes love itself. That is the meaning of your name: the ultimate love, the divine love.\nThen one is simply love, not even loving.\nWhen one's whole energy is transformed into love, then the lotus of one's consciousness opens up. That is the highest peak, and our hearts are longing for it. And it is possible to fulfill it, one just needs a little intelligence and watchfulness so that one can discriminate between what is love and what is not love., When you see what is not love -- and it is not difficult... Even the possessive person can see that possessiveness is not love, that jealousy is not\nlove, that domination is not love. And when you see it, then don't just go on seeing it, do something, move towards the opposite pole.\nIf possessiveness is there then become non-possessive. If jealousy is there then become more and more non-jealous, allow space and freedom. If you see domination is there then drop the ego. The other has to be respected, the other has not to be reduced to a commodity. Nobody is a means for you, everybody is an end unto himself or herself.\nThis respect for the other is a basic requirement if one wants to move on the path which leads ultimately to God.\nHow long will you be here? I don't know.\nBe here forever! Good. Sanjayo means the victorious.\nThere are two kinds of victories. One, which is a pseudo victory, a fool's paradise, is over others. It is 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nsoon shattered. Death comes and shatters all your victories over others. Suddenly you are standing naked without anything and the realisation that you have wasted your life. But now it is too late: death does not wait, it does not give time, it does not give you a few more opportunities.\nThe other victory, the true victory, is victory over oneself, when you become conscious and start changing all that is unconscious in yourself, you have started fighting with your darkness. And one's darkness consists of ego, violence, anger, greed, lust -- all that is ugly and monstrous. All these monsters go on hiding in the darkness.\nThere is no need to fight with each monster separately because that would be a long, long process; one life would not be enough. That's why Hindus have to think of many lives, because if you have to fight with each monster separately then it would take thousands of lives to be finished with all.\nThere is no need to fight with each wrong separately. There is a simple process of increasing your consciousness, of making yourself more alert and more aware. As consciousness spreads and the unconscious starts dispersing, with the unconscious all the monsters disappear of their own accord. They cannot exist without darkness, they are inseparable from darkness. So there is no need to fight with anger and lust and greed separately. That is absolutely foolish. The whole effort should be focussed on awareness\n-- that is the key.\nA sannyasin has to become as much aware as possible, and the more aware you become, the more you are aware that there is still territory within you which is dark. But one day the point comes when there is nothing which is dark in you. That is the point when one is awakened, enlightened, when one becomes a Buddha. That is true victory.\nVeet Puratan. Veet means surpassing, transcending. Puratan means the old.\nThe old is very heavy on us. It is a mountainous load that everybody is carrying and is being crushed under. It is impossible to move, the load is so much. Centuries and centuries have gone before you and it has all become accumulated and you are carrying that load. We have become beasts of burden. We are dying under the weight, but we cling to the weight, we think it is very precious. It is not precious at all. It is death, it is not life. One has to get rid of it.\nAnd it is not that the load is clinging to you, it is you who is clinging to it. If the load were clinging to you then it would be impossible to get rid of it, but there is great hope because it is up to you to cling to it or not to cling to it.\nOne has to live each moment anew, fresh, young. One has to be so young each moment as if one is born again and again. In other words, one has to die each moment to all that is old and one has to be born again to the new, only then does one come to know what this existence is. Then it is tremendously ecstatic, it is just pure bliss and nothing else. But our eyes are so covered with the dust of the old, and we think that the old is gold. It is just rubbish, rotten! But thinking it is\ngold we go on carrying it.\nSannyas means a new life, so new that it is always a surprise, so new that you live in awe and wonder, so new that it is unpredictable. Then every small thing becomes so extraordinary, so exquisite, so beautiful, that it is unbelievable.\nSo just do one thing and do it in a single blows don't go on doing it chunk by chunk because it is a very big load; if you try to do it chunk by chunk your life will be wasted. Do it in a single blow and never look back and never repent for it, and never feel guilty about it.\nThe moment you are free of the old you will taste freedom for the first time -- and freedom is another name of god.\nSatyo Pratita. Satyo means truth. Pratita means experiencing.\nTruth can only be experienced, it cannot be expressed. One can know it, but one cannot say it. It is like a taste; you cannot communicate it to somebody who has not tasted it. And those who have tasted it need not be told about it; they know themselves. So all the theories about truth are false. They are about truth, that's why they are false. The word 'about' means around. About and about they go, around and around they go, but they never touch the center, they move on the circumference.\nPhilosophy is the circumference and religion is the center. The basic difference is that philosophy thinks, religion experiences.\nNow, a blind man can become a philosopher about light. He can think much about light. He can go on making great systems of thought about light. He can imagine, and he has much more freedom to imagine than the person who has eyes, because the person who has eyes knows what light is; he cannot imagine 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nsomething contrary to reality. The blind man can imagine in every direction, in\nevery possible way. He can be very imaginative and he can be very logical; he can make a systematic, logical philosophy about light out of his blindness, but it will be about light. And beware of the word 'about'. Unless somebody sees light, all that he is saying is nonsense.\nThe mystics have always said that philosophy is nonsense because it is thinking. It is like a thirsty man thinking about water. Even if he discovers the formula H2O it is not going to help him; he is thirsty, he needs water, not H2O. And we need truth, not theories about truth. We need experience, not Christianity, Hinduism, Mohammedanism -- these are all ideologies about truth. And experience only comes through meditation, there is no other way.\nMind gives you thinking, meditation gives you experiencing. So the shift has to happen from mind to no-mind. Meditation is a state of no-mind.\nVeet Atita. Veet means transcending. Atita means the past.\nLife is always now and here, and mind is never now and here -- it is always somewhere else, it is always then and there. It is either in the past or in the future; but the future is not different from the past, it is a projection of the past. In the past you have experienced many things -- good and bad, beautiful and ugly, pleasant and painful. Out of all that experience you project a future. It is chosen out of the past. It is a collage: all that is pleasant you have chosen and you have dropped all that is painful. All that was sad you have put aside and all that you think was nice you have chosen and projected, you have magnified. So future is not really separate from the past; it is a selected past but it is the past all the same.\nLife is in the present and mind is in the past. Mind means the past, mind means the memory, the memory system. It is a computer: it collects all information, it goes on collecting all that is happening. It is good to use it for ordinary purposes: to remember a phone number, somebody's name, somebody's face. Of course one has to remember that this man is your boyfriend! If you transcend the past completely and you go back home and you ask your boyfriend, \"Who are you and what are you doing here?\" (much laughter) For ordinary purposes it is okay but for deeper purposes it is dangerous. It is good to remember the boyfriend but it is bad to remember what he has done in the past. That is psychological memory -- one has to forget all about it so that each day the boyfriend is new. People need new boyfriends because they cannot make the old one new. The old\none goes on becoming older and older and older (laughter) and then so much dust is dumped on him. Then one gets completely lost -- where has the old boyfriend gone? It is just dust piled up! So one starts looking for somebody new.\nIf one can drop the past from the mind -- I mean the psychological past, not the factual past -- then each moment is new, then each experience is new because you are not interpreting it according to the past; you are simply seeing it as it is. And then life becomes really vast, infinite, and then it has all the splendor one can imagine and dream about. It is really far more beautiful than the sweetest dream, far more beautiful than the greatest poetry and far more penetrating than the highest music. But one has to learn one thing, very fundamental: to go on dropping the past.\nNever project the future, because whatsoever you project about the future will give you misery. If it is fulfilled it will be nothing but a repetition of the past. And no repetition can ever be fulfilling; it is always boring, tiring. If it is not fulfilled then you will be disappointed; you had hoped so much. If you project the future, either way you are disappointed: if it is fulfilled you are miserable, if it is not fulfilled you are miserable. So the best way is not to project it. But if the past is carried along then you will be projecting it, you are bound to project it.\nIt is intrinsic in carrying the past to project the future. Dropping the past means you have destroyed the project itself, now nothing can be projected. The past becomes psychologically clean and the future remains open. In an open future whatsoever happens is blissful. One feels immensely blessed.\nThe only true way to live one's life is to live in the present. To be herenow is what I mean by sannyas.\n(Osho pauses and grins before he asks:)\nHow long are you going to be here? (much laughter)\n-A few more weeks.\nThat's not right! -- come back again.

god.</p><p>Man is not an accident. But that's what science still believes, that
man is an accident. According to science everything is accidental; the
world itself has no meaning, it has no inner unity, it is not an organic
whole. It is just a chaos, and in the chaos things are happening but
they are accidental, not intentional. That's the basic difference
between the religious attitude and the scientific. Religion says the
world is a cosmos, not a chaos, and whatsoever is happening is not
accidental but intentional, that there is a purpose behind it, that
there is an undercurrent of meaning holding everything together and that
man is the most significant phenomenon.</p><p>Hence to say that man is accidental is to destroy all his joy. One
cannot feel joyous if one is a mere accident. One will start feeling
empty, rejected, not wanted, not needed. That's what is happening all
around 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:justify id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished>Osho's books on

miserable, sad, meaningless, and then once life starts losing meaning,
sooner or later suicide remains the only way to get out of it.</p><p>Man is coming, individually, socially, universally, closer and closer
to suicide, Except through religion man cannot be saved. Man needs to
feel meaningful; and it is not a question of inventing meaning, meaning
is already there -- it has to be discovered. Once you discover some
meaning in your life there is great rejoicing. You are needed by
existence, you are not superfluous, you cannot be discarded like
rubbish. You will be missed if you are not there, without you, something
will be lacking.</p><p>That's the meaning of Joachim -- your being appointed by god means
the universe intentionally wants you, the whole universe wants you. And
it is not only the question of you; even a small blade of grass is as
much needed as the greatest star. The very ordinary person is as much
needed as any Albert Einstein. There is no hierarchy in existence.
Existence is absolutely just, it treats everybody equally. Animals,
birds, trees, planets, man -- all are joined together for a certain
ultimate destiny.</p><p>The conscious search for that destiny is sannyas, the deliberate
effort to discover the meaning of life is sannyas. Sannyas is the
science of discovering meaning, significance.</p><p>Anand Bela. Anand means bliss. Bela means beautiful.</p><p>The only thing really beautiful is blissfulness. And the only thing
ugly is sadness, misery. But because the majority of human beings live
in misery, they worship misery. They are afraid of bliss, they are
afraid of blissful people. They cannot believe that somebody is really
blissful, hence they deny the Buddhas, the Christs. The whole effort of
the mob psychology is to say that such persons have never existed and if
they exist it is better, immediately, to destroy them, because they
create a disturbance in their minds. The disturbance is, "If somebody is
blissful that means that is my possibility too, and I am miserable, so I
have to change myself, I have to go through a transformation, and that
seems to be very arduous, an uphill task."</p><p>It is not coincidental that the awakened, the enlightened, the really
beautiful</p><p>people, have always been mistreated by the mob. For the simple reason
that they have become accustomed to their misery, to their ugliness and
they don't want to encounter any mirror, they don't want to see their
own faces. Rather than seeing their faces and seeing the ugliness, they
would rather like to destroy the mirror. They will say, "It is because
of the mirror that we are looking ugly; the mirror is responsible.
Destroy the mirror and we are perfectly okay as we have always
been."</p><p>Beautiful people have existed very rarely. To be beautiful is risky,
dangerous, but the risk has to be taken, otherwise one misses the whole
of life. It is better to live for a single moment in total bliss than to
live a long life of misery. It is better to live in bliss and be
crucified than to live in misery, carrying your own cross for the whole
of your life; then life is pointless.</p><p>My sannyasins have to accept the challenge, they have to learn how to
be blissful. That's my only work here, to help you to be blissful, to be
beautiful, to attain to an inner harmony and grace; then whatsoever the
cost, one has to pay it.</p><p>How long will you be here? How long will you be staying? I don't
know.</p><p>Be here. You seem to belong here! Good.</p><p>Anand Hannes. Anand means bliss. Hannes means god's gracious
gift.</p><p>Misery is man's invention, bliss is a gift from the beyond, so if one
stops creating misery one becomes blissful: the gift is always there.
But we go on ignoring it. We are too occupied in creating our
misery.</p><p>Continuously, twenty-four hours a day, people are working hard,
overtime, to create misery. They are doing great work. If you watch
yourself you will understand what I mean (laughter). Nobody misses a
single opportunity to be miserable And one cannot be both miserable and
blissful together. If you are so full of misery and continuously
creating it there is no space for bliss to enter you. It remains
standing at the door.</p><p>Unless you empty yourself of all misery it cannot enter.</p><p>Meditation means emptying yourself of the misery that you have
created in the</p><p>past and not creating the same misery again.</p><p>Just today I was reading the definition of a bachelors A bachelor is
a person who has not committed the same mistake even once!
(laughter)</p><p>But if you cannot be a bachelor, at least don't get married again,
don't commit it twice. And there are people who are committing the same
mistake millions of times. If a man is alert he can see all around what
people are doing and that will be enough... but that much understanding
is rare. But one can learn at least 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on

in the past and you will see you have been wounding yourself. And you
don't allow your wounds to heal; you go on opening them again and again,
you go on scratching them again and again. Then slowly slowly it becomes
just a mechanical habit, then one goes around in a vicious circle from
one misery to another, and one becomes of course, more and more skilful.
Whatsoever you do remember, you will become efficient in it, you will
become an expert. And I have come across so many experts in creating
misery that I sometimes wonder what people are doing with their lives.
With the same energy, with the same effort, with the same commitment,
they would have achieved the greatest bliss possible.</p><p>And people are doing the work of creating misery so religiously, so
devotedly, that if you want to stop them they won't listen to you.</p><p>To become a sannyasin means you have to stop your old patterns and
you have to learn a new style of life. Start, even though you have to
start from the very beginning; learn the ABC of cheerfulness,
blissfulness and slowly slowly you will become an expert in that
too.</p><p>And the whole expertise in bliss is simple; the expertise in misery
is very complex, it needs many people, it needs many things. It needs
money, power, prestige, family, wife, husband, children -- thousands of
things. It needs politics</p><p>and the church, and political ideology and what not. One has to
arrange a whole junkyard around oneself, then finally one succeeds in
being miserable.</p><p>Being blissful needs nothing. You have just to be spacious, empty,
and bliss starts pouring... yes, dogs and cats! It is not just a shower,
it really pours! (laughter) Deva Prita. Deva means divine. Prita means
love.</p><p>Love is one of the most divine qualities. One can enter into God from
many doors. Love is one of the doors and one of the most beautiful doors
to enter into God because it is more aesthetic, more musical, more
poetic.</p><p>Truth is also a door but it is dry, desertlike, logical. There are
people who may like to enter from the desert route -- that is their
choice -- but when one can go through the garden path, with birds
singing and flowers and fragrances, why unnecessarily go through a
desert? If one is a masochist, if one enjoys torturing oneself, then it
is another matter. But rarely are there people who would like to torture
themselves. Even if they continue torturing themselves because they have
been taught to, deep down they don't want it.</p><p>Everybody would like to live a life in a beautiful way, in a
sensitive way. Love is the most beautiful path towards God, but one has
to go on purifying it.</p><p>The ordinary love is too full of jealousy, possessiveness, anger,
hatred, domination, ego -- these are all enemies of love, these are
parasites. As these parasites are removed, love starts becoming purer,
more alive, more intense, total.</p><p>First, love is a relationship, and then love is only a friendship.
Then love is only a loving quality, and ultimately one becomes love
itself. That is the meaning of your name: the ultimate love, the divine
love.</p><p>Then one is simply love, not even loving.</p><p>When one's whole energy is transformed into love, then the lotus of
one's consciousness opens up. That is the highest peak, and our hearts
are longing for it. And it is possible to fulfill it, one just needs a
little intelligence and watchfulness so that one can discriminate
between what is love and what is not love., When you see what is not
love -- and it is not difficult... Even the possessive person can see
that possessiveness is not love, that jealousy is not</p><p>love, that domination is not love. And when you see it, then don't
just go on seeing it, do something, move towards the opposite pole.</p><p>If possessiveness is there then become non-possessive. If jealousy is
there then become more and more non-jealous, allow space and freedom. If
you see domination is there then drop the ego. The other has to be
respected, the other has not to be reduced to a commodity. Nobody is a
means for you, everybody is an end unto himself or herself.</p><p>This respect for the other is a basic requirement if one wants to
move on the path which leads ultimately to God.</p><p>How long will you be here? I don't know.</p><p>Be here forever! Good. Sanjayo means the victorious.</p><p>There are two kinds of victories. One, which is a pseudo victory, a
fool's paradise, is over others. It is 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on

others. Suddenly you are standing naked without anything and the
realisation that you have wasted your life. But now it is too late:
death does not wait, it does not give time, it does not give you a few
more opportunities.</p><p>The other victory, the true victory, is victory over oneself, when
you become conscious and start changing all that is unconscious in
yourself, you have started fighting with your darkness. And one's
darkness consists of ego, violence, anger, greed, lust -- all that is
ugly and monstrous. All these monsters go on hiding in the darkness.</p><p>There is no need to fight with each monster separately because that
would be a long, long process; one life would not be enough. That's why
Hindus have to think of many lives, because if you have to fight with
each monster separately then it would take thousands of lives to be
finished with all.</p><p>There is no need to fight with each wrong separately. There is a
simple process of increasing your consciousness, of making yourself more
alert and more aware. As consciousness spreads and the unconscious
starts dispersing, with the unconscious all the monsters disappear of
their own accord. They cannot exist without darkness, they are
inseparable from darkness. So there is no need to fight with anger and
lust and greed separately. That is absolutely foolish. The whole effort
should be focussed on awareness</p><p>-- that is the key.</p><p>A sannyasin has to become as much aware as possible, and the more
aware you become, the more you are aware that there is still territory
within you which is dark. But one day the point comes when there is
nothing which is dark in you. That is the point when one is awakened,
enlightened, when one becomes a Buddha. That is true victory.</p><p>Veet Puratan. Veet means surpassing, transcending. Puratan means the
old.</p><p>The old is very heavy on us. It is a mountainous load that everybody
is carrying and is being crushed under. It is impossible to move, the
load is so much. Centuries and centuries have gone before you and it has
all become accumulated and you are carrying that load. We have become
beasts of burden. We are dying under the weight, but we cling to the
weight, we think it is very precious. It is not precious at all. It is
death, it is not life. One has to get rid of it.</p><p>And it is not that the load is clinging to you, it is <em>you</em>
who is clinging to it. If the load were clinging to you then it would be
impossible to get rid of it, but there is great hope because it is up to
you to cling to it or not to cling to it.</p><p>One has to live each moment anew, fresh, young. One has to be so
young each moment as if one is born again and again. In other words, one
has to die each moment to all that is old and one has to be born again
to the new, only then does one come to know what this existence is. Then
it is tremendously ecstatic, it is just pure bliss and nothing else. But
our eyes are so covered with the dust of the old, and we think that the
old is gold. It is just rubbish, rotten! But thinking it is</p><p>gold we go on carrying it.</p><p>Sannyas means a new life, so new that it is always a surprise, so new
that you live in awe and wonder, so new that it is unpredictable. Then
every small thing becomes so extraordinary, so exquisite, so beautiful,
that it is unbelievable.</p><p>So just do one thing and do it in a single blows don't go on doing it
chunk by chunk because it is a very big load; if you try to do it chunk
by chunk your life will be wasted. Do it in a single blow and never look
back and never repent for it, and never feel guilty about it.</p><p>The moment you are free of the old you will taste freedom for the
first time -- and freedom is another name of god.</p><p>Satyo Pratita. Satyo means truth. Pratita means experiencing.</p><p>Truth can only be experienced, it cannot be expressed. One can know
it, but one cannot say it. It is like a taste; you cannot communicate it
to somebody who has not tasted it. And those who have tasted it need not
be told about it; they know themselves. So all the theories about truth
are false. They are <em>about</em> truth, that's why they are false. The
word 'about' means around. About and about they go, around and around
they go, but they never touch the center, they move on the
circumference.</p><p>Philosophy is the circumference and religion is the center. The basic
difference is that philosophy thinks, religion experiences.</p><p>Now, a blind man can become a philosopher about light. He can think
much about light. He can go on making great systems of thought about
light. He can imagine, and he has much more freedom to imagine than the
person who has eyes, because the person who has eyes knows what light
is; he cannot imagine 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on

direction, in</p><p>every possible way. He can be very imaginative and he can be very
logical; he can make a systematic, logical philosophy <em>about</em>
light out of his blindness, but it will be about light. And beware of
the word 'about'. Unless somebody <em>sees</em> light, all that he is
saying is nonsense.</p><p>The mystics have always said that philosophy is nonsense because it
is thinking. It is like a thirsty man thinking about water. Even if he
discovers the formula H2O it is not going to help him; he is thirsty, he
needs water, not H2O. And we need truth, not theories about truth. We
need experience, not Christianity, Hinduism, Mohammedanism -- these are
all ideologies <em>about</em> truth. And experience only comes through
meditation, there is no other way.</p><p>Mind gives you thinking, meditation gives you experiencing. So the
shift has to happen from mind to no-mind. Meditation is a state of
no-mind.</p><p>Veet Atita. Veet means transcending. Atita means the past.</p><p>Life is always now and here, and mind is never now and here -- it is
always somewhere else, it is always then and there. It is either in the
past or in the future; but the future is not different from the past, it
is a projection of the past. In the past you have experienced many
things -- good and bad, beautiful and ugly, pleasant and painful. Out of
all that experience you project a future. It is chosen out of the past.
It is a collage: all that is pleasant you have chosen and you have
dropped all that is painful. All that was sad you have put aside and all
that you think was nice you have chosen and projected, you have
magnified. So future is not really separate from the past; it is a
selected past but it is the past all the same.</p><p>Life is in the present and mind is in the past. Mind means the past,
mind means the memory, the memory system. It is a computer: it collects
all information, it goes on collecting all that is happening. It is good
to use it for ordinary purposes: to remember a phone number, somebody's
name, somebody's face. Of course one has to remember that this man is
your boyfriend! If you transcend the past completely and you go back
home and you ask your boyfriend, "Who are you and what are you doing
here?" (much laughter) For ordinary purposes it is okay but for deeper
purposes it is dangerous. It is good to remember the boyfriend but it is
bad to remember what he has done in the past. That is psychological
memory -- one has to forget all about it so that each day the boyfriend
is new. People need new boyfriends because they cannot make the old one
new. The old</p><p>one goes on becoming older and older and older (laughter) and then so
much dust is dumped on him. Then one gets completely lost -- where has
the old boyfriend gone? It is just dust piled up! So one starts looking
for somebody new.</p><p>If one can drop the past from the mind -- I mean the psychological
past, not the factual past -- then each moment is new, then each
experience is new because you are not interpreting it according to the
past; you are simply seeing it as it is. And then life becomes really
vast, infinite, and then it has all the splendor one can imagine and
dream about. It is really <em>far</em> more beautiful than the sweetest
dream, far more beautiful than the greatest poetry and far more
penetrating than the highest music. But one has to learn one thing, very
fundamental: to go on dropping the past.</p><p>Never project the future, because whatsoever you project about the
future will give you misery. If it is fulfilled it will be nothing but a
repetition of the past. And no repetition can ever be fulfilling; it is
always boring, tiring. If it is not fulfilled then you will be
disappointed; you had hoped so much. If you project the future, either
way you are disappointed: if it is fulfilled you are miserable, if it is
not fulfilled you are miserable. So the best way is not to project it.
But if the past is carried along then you will be projecting it, you are
bound to project it.</p><p>It is intrinsic in carrying the past to project the future. Dropping
the past means you have destroyed the project itself, now nothing can be
projected. The past becomes psychologically clean and the future remains
open. In an open future whatsoever happens is blissful. One feels
immensely blessed.</p><p>The only true way to live one's life is to live in the present. To be
herenow is what I mean by sannyas.</p><p>(Osho pauses and grins before he asks:)</p><p>How long are you going to be here? (much laughter)</p><p>-A few more weeks.</p><p>That's not right! -- come back again.

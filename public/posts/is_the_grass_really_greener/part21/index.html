It is for reference purposes only.]\nAnand Gerard. Anand means bliss. Gerard means courageous, brave; it also means symbolically, loyal heart.\nThe phenomenon of bliss has a few basic requirements, and these two are very important: courage and loyalty. And both belong to the heart. The mind is always a coward and the mind is always full of doubts.\nCowardliness and doubting are two sides of the same coin, and in the same way courage and trust are two sides of the same coin.\nSannyas means changing the gestalt, the pattern of your energy, shifting yourself from the head to the heart. The moment you start living through the heart, life is blissful -- that is a by-product. If you live through the head life is a misery -- that too is a by-product. The head is impotent in creating bliss -- and we are all trying to do that, hence the tremendous failure of humanity.\nIt is not only a question of a few individuals; the whole of humanity is at a loss now. We have tried for centuries to live through the head and we have created deeper and deeper misery. We have made the earth a hell, now it is the time that, rather than going on the same track, in the same vicious circle, we change the\nwhole energy pattern. Man needs a rebirth, a radical change. The future belongs to the heart; and my effort here is to help you to bring your energy from the head to the heart. Once it is there, life is a song, a 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- celebration.\nDhyan Vivien. Dhyan means meditation. Vivien means lively, alive, full of life.\nPeople are alive only at the minimum. The difference between death and life is not much. People are existing only on the boundary line -- just a little accident and they are no more. Why people have decided to live at the minimum is one of the most significant questions worth pondering over.\nThere is a Sufi story: a king made a palace only with one door, there was not even a window, so that he could be absolutely safe. That one door was guarded by a big military force and over that military force there was another force to supervise, and then another force to supervise them; so three circles of military forces were guarding only one door.\nOne of the king's friends -- who was also a king -- visited him. He had heard much about this palace and when he saw it he said 'It is really safe. There is no possibility of any danger.'\nWhen he was departing the owner of the palace came out to give him a send-off and again the guest praised the palace and he said 'I will also make a palace like this.' A beggar sitting on the street started laughing. They both asked him 'Why are you laughing?' The king who owned the palace said 'What is so funny about his praising my palace?' The man said 'I am laughing because there is only one loophole -- that one door. If you really want to be safe you be inside and let people make a wall instead of a door -- then you will be absolutely safe. Right now you are only ninety -- nine point nine per cent safe and that point one per cent of danger is enough to kill a person. That's why I am laughing.'\nThe story is significant; it says people have started living at the minimum to be\nsafe, to be secure. To live fully means to live dangerously, to live fully means to live in insecurity, to live fully means to live at the maximum. Then life is an adventure, then one never knows what is going to happen; one cannot be predictable. But life is life only when you live at the maximum, at the highest peak. Of course the danger is there that if you fall from the peak you are gone forever, but that danger is worthwhile, that risk is worthwhile. If one chooses not to take that risk then one lives in vain; one only vegetates and calls it life.\nMeditation is nothing but the process of helping you to go to the ultimate peak of your energy, to transfer your energy from the minimum to the maximum, from the valley to the peak. Hence meditation teaches you to live dangerously, to live adventurously, to live like a gambler, not like a businessman.\nSannyas is a gamble. It is risky, it is going into the unknown, into the uncharted -\n- but that's its beauty too. The very danger brings life.\nJust the other day I was reading that a man, a very great criminal in America, has died. His whole expertise was robbing banks; for his whole life he was robbing banks. For almost forty years of the sixty-five years of his life he was in goal, but he robbed all the big banks, he was the most famous robber.\nHe has written a small autobiography and he says 'The most alive moments in my life were when I was robbing a bank. I lived for those few moments; all else was just a preparation to live. Those few moments when I was robbing a bank, actually robbing -- the risk, the danger, the wondering what was going to happen, whether I was going to succeed or was going to be caught or killed... Those were the few moments I lived!'\nNow if this man had met me, then I would have told him to rob god. Why are you just robbing the bank of America? The real risk is robbing god, his kingdom\n-- and that's the whole art of meditation. It makes you a master thief. So get ready!\nPrem Oscar. Prem moans love. Oscar means god's spear. Love is certainly god's spear: it kills you -- but it resurrects you also. It goes directly to the heart.\nAll that is needed is to be available to god, and by saying that I simply mean to be available to existence\n-- to me god and existence are synonymous -- to be available to the sun, to the\nwind, to the rain, to be available to all that is, to be open and vulnerable. Then one day the spear comes and shatters you, just kills you. But that death is the most precious thing in life. To be killed by god is the greatest blessing because out of that death arises a totally now kind of life.\nIn fact then you know that whatsoever you have been calling life was not life. Compared to that your old life looks like death, your old light looks like darkness, your old riches look like poverty. But we have been brought up not to be vulnerable, not to be open, to remain closed-fisted. We are brought up in fear, and fear is the only thing that prevents love; fear is the direct opposite of love. To live in fear is to live a loveless life, and a loveless life cannot taste god.\nSo drop all fears. There is nothing to fear because nothing can be taken away from you. Remember one 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nfundamental law: that which you have really got cannot be taken away, so only the non-essential can be taken away; the essential cannot be taken away. It is part of your innermost existence, it is inseparably one with you. There is no possibility of creating a division between the essential and you. The essential means you -- the essence. That is your real richness, and nobody can rob you of it, not even god; it is impossible to lose it. And that to which you are clinging is bound to be taken away -- if not today then tomorrow, is not tomorrow then the day after tomorrow. And sooner it is taken, the better, because if it is not taken soon then you will be worrying about it; once it is taken the worry is finished. Then there is no more worry because all is gone, so why bother? One can have a good sleep, can rest and relax.\nGod always comes as a death to the ego.\nIn the ancient Indian scriptures the master is called death, and it is very significant because the master means one who is going to become the door to god: god will enter through the master. The moment you are in tune with the master you are available to god. The master is only a device to bring you into a certain tuning so that the spear of god can go directly to your heart.\nAnd the most precious moment is when the ego dies and you are left egoless. Egolessness is love. Then love flows for no reason at all. And not to anybody in particular, it simply flows just as fragrance is released from a flowers unaddressed, to whomsoever it may concern.\nSuryodaya means sunrise.\nI have chosen the colour red with all its shades for my sannyasins. It symbolises sunrise, the reddening of the eastern horizon just before the sun arrives. The East becomes full of colours, but they are all shades of red. It is getting ready to welcome the sun. The night is over, the birds have started singing, the flowers have started opening, the people and the animals and the trees are waking up. Life is going through a new birth.\nThe night has been a small death; the sun heralds the beginning of a new day. Again life will celebrate and dance and sing, again there will be love and joy and all that is beautiful and alive.\nSannyas is sunrise in the inner world, the early morning, the dawn, the declaration that the night is over and that the day is just close by, at hand -- get ready to welcome it!\nPurvodaya means the rise of the East.\nThe East is a symbol for the inner, just as the West is the symbol for the outer. The East represents religion, the West represents science. Both are significant and a great meeting of the two is needed. And it will be the greatest blessing for humanity when Rudyard Kipling is proved wrong. He says, \"East is East and West is West and n'er the twain shall meet.\"\nOrdinarily he looks right because how can the inner and the outer meet, and how can science and religion meet? -- they look poles apart. But those who dive deeper find a strange phenomenon, that all polarities are joined together, already joined together, that all polar opposites are really complementaries. It is just as the negative and the positive poles of electricity cannot exist in separation -- they have to be together. It is just as man and woman cannot exist separately, just as night and day and summer and winter and life and death, are joined together.\nSo it is not really a question of creating a synthesis between East and West; it is only a question of discovering it -- it is already there. But whether the meeting is\ndiscovered or not, one thing has to be remembered -- that the West has fulfilled its work, and now the time has come for the East to contribute, otherwise humanity will remain lopsided.\nThe West has given science, technology, all that is needed to make life comfortable on the outside; the East has to give its part, so that life can be blissful inside. So a great rise of the East is immensely needed and immediately needed.\nAnd only when both have contributed in a balanced way can we discover that they are complementary.\nMy effort here is to give you the keys of eastern mysticism.\nIt is not a coincidence that so many western intellectuals, artists, painters, musicians, poets, scientists have gathered around me. It is significant because only they can understand that which is missing. The East is living in such poverty, in such an ugly state of affairs that it has no time to think of higher things. It pays lip-service to the Buddha, to Krishna, to Mahavira, to Lao Tzu, but it is only lip-service. It has lost track of its own inheritance, so it doesn't feel that it is missing something on the inner.\nYou can only feel that something is missed on the inner when the outer is there; then in contrast you can see that the inner is missing. If the outer is missing then you will never be able to see that the inner is missing. When you are rich on the outside you can immediately feel that inside you are poor.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThe East is poor on the outside, hence it cannot feel that the inner is also poor -- they look alike, there is no contrast. So very few people from the East will be benefitted by me. They will be benefitted in a very round-about way: first the West has to be given the keys and once the West starts becoming spiritually rich then these eastern people will start learning from the West the same keys that\nthey always had with them but which they had completely forgotten about.\nTo me, East does not mean just the East of today; to me it symbolizes all the great spiritual experiences that happened in the East. And tremendous is the contribution of Lao Tzu, Chuang Tzu, Lieh Tzu, Buddha, Mahavira, Krishna, Kabir -- tremendous is the contribution. But the East is not in a state to understand it.\nThe West is in a state now to understand it. For the first time in the West it is possible to understand Lao Tzu, Zen, Yoga, Tantra.\nThe East has to rise in the West. It looks very contradictory but that's how it is: the sun has to rise in the West. And that's what is slowly happening here. And in the new commune it is going to happen on a vaster scale.\nYou all have to be aware that you are participating in something tremendously important. Its significance will become clear only very much later on; only history will be able to look back and see its importance, because only later on can you see, with a bigger perspective, what has happened. When it is actually happening nobody is capable of understanding unless one is awakened.\nI have heard that when Jesus was born Joseph came in and was very much puzzled because Mary was crying and weeping. He said \"What are you doing? You have given birth to such a beautiful child and you are crying...\" She said \"Yes, because I always wanted a girl!\"\nIt is difficult, when Jesus is there it is difficult. Even his mother is crying!\nSo this country is not going to understand me, the East is not going to understand me; on the contrary they will condemn me. I have to depend on the West. But my work consists in giving birth, a rebirth, to the East.\nPrem Arti. Prem means love. Arti means worship, prayer.\nLove is the only true worship. One need not go to any church or synagogue or temple, one has just to become loving. Love needs no belief, no theology, no priest. We are born with the energy, we just have to be courageous enough to share it.\nAnd one has to share it not only with the person one has fallen in love with --\nbecause when you make your love very narrow and limited your soul also becomes very narrow and limited. When love becomes exclusive then it starts dying. It has to be inclusive, it has to include all, only then does it reach to its full flowering, then it rises to the highest peak, it becomes an Everest.\nSo love the people you are in love with, but love strangers too. And not only people -- love animals, trees, rocks, stars. In short, simply love -- don't be bothered about to whom it is addressed. Any excuse is enough and one should be loving. And if there is no excuse, invent excuses, but be loving!\nThe whole emphasis is on being loving. And these are the three stages: first, love is one-pointed, exclusive; second, one becomes loving, inclusive, and third, one simply becomes love. That is the moment when it becomes worship and that is the moment when one becomes aware of god.\nSatish means, your very being is God. Sat means being, ish means God.\nGod is not something outside you, God is your very being. And one has to discover God inside oneself.\nGoing anywhere is pointless unless you go in. Every journey to some other place is an escape from yourself; you are going farther away from God. When you are not going anywhere, not even in thoughts and dreams and desires, when all journeying, physical and psychological, has come to a full stop -- when all journeying as such has stopped -- suddenly you discover that which has always been there, but you were never there so the meeting was not happening. It is at the very center of your existence that God is luminous.\nOnce he has been found there then you can find him everywhere else, but first he has to be found within.\nThen he is in every person, every animal, every tree, every rock; then he is all over the place. And to know that your being and the being of the whole universe are one, brings tremendous rejoicing. All fear disappears, all worry disappears, all anxiety disappears because now there is no death: you have become part of the eternal. You are no more a part, you have become the whole.\nKavya Gunjano. Kavya means poetry. Gunjano means humming. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nMan is made of music. There is a deep humming inside. We are made of that song -- it is wordless it is pure sound, hence I call it humming. It has no meaning but tremendous significance. You cannot interpret it, you cannot describe it, you cannot define it, but once you have experienced it your life becomes luminous you are glowing with it, it is a glory. It brings a new shine to your being, a new flavour and fragrance.\nThis is one of the secret discoveries of all the mystics, that basically life is poetry, not prose, music, not mathematics, mystery, not science. And when the whole mind has ceased and there is no functioning of the mind, then you can hear that humming sound rising upwards from the depths of your being. One becomes overwhelmed by it. One feels renewed, reborn -- it is so refreshing, it is such a rejuvenation. One is bathed with the divine.\nIn the East we have called that humming 'omkar': the sound of om. The sound of om comes closest to it\n-- it is not exactly it, but approximately it. If you hum 'om, om...', then it gives you some feel of it, but just approximately, not exactly.\nSo get more and more in tune with poetry and music and get out of the mind. Dance and sing and celebrate with great abandon. That is going to be your meditation, that is going to be your entry into sannyas: be drunk.\nI am inviting all kinds of dangerous people -- gamblers, drunkards, crazy cuckoos all kinds of people (much laughter). but they are the most beautiful people in the world. The so-called sane are just ugly; they are too sane to be alive, to calculative, too Jewish -- they cannot be human!\nSatyam means the truth.\nTruth is not something which can be found by philosophizing, it is not a conclusion of thought; on the contrary it is a realization of no-thought. Philosophy is a distraction: one has to stop philosophizing.\nJust today I was reading one of Rudolf Steiner's statements that \"If a German comes to a crossroad and one sign says 'heaven' and the other says 'lecture about heaven', the German always goes to the lecture about heaven.\" Philosophy is that kind of thing; a lecture about the truth.\nBe less a thinker and more an experiencer. That's my fundamental message, be existential. Intellect can go on round and round but it never reaches the real thing. It cannot, it's not possible for it. Truth has to be found in a state of no- mind, so the whole work here consists in putting the mind aside, in living beyond mind, in just living and rejoicing in living without thinking about it.\nAnd it is not only true about Germans, it is true about almost everybody in the world; particularly about the educated people. And unfortunately now almost everybody, more or less, is educated. For one hundred years universal education has been the slogan of the social reformers and the missionaries and the servants of the people and they have almost educated everybody. Now everybody is thinking and nobody is living.\nD.H. Lawrence has a good suggestion that if we could close all the schools and all the universities for one hundred years then there would be hope for humanity. I agree perfectly with him; it would be a tremendously beautiful experiment. For a hundred years all Oxfords and Cambridges and all schools and colleges from Kindergarten to the university, would be closed -- a one-hundred-year holiday! And in those one hundred years man would regain his primitiveness, his authenticity, his existential status. And I don't think that man will open those schools and colleges again -- ever!\nTruth is within you, just be silent and know it. It is a question of being silent and knowing. Thinking keeps you occupied, so much so that you cannot know that truth is already inside you, it is already the case.\nSatyodaya means the rise of truth.\nMan has lived in beliefs for centuries, and beliefs have deprived man of truth. To believe simply means to be untruthful. One believes only because one does not know, if one knows, there is no need to believe.\nFor example, I don't believe in god, because I know -- there is no need to believe. The man with eyes does not believe in light, he knows it; but the blind man believes. He believes there is light, there are colours and there are people\nwith eyes -- that is his belief.\nBelief is a deception, it keeps you deluded. Truth can rise in you if you are ready to drop all the beliefs\n-- Christian, Hindu, Mohammedan, Buddhist. One should not choose. Without any choice put all the beliefs in one bag and throw them into the ocean. And do it in a single blow, don't go gradually, slowly slowly throwing one belief and then another, then another -- because then it will take many lives to get rid of them.\nThere are millions of beliefs, beliefs within beliefs. They are like Chinese boxes, boxes within boxes: you open one and throw it, another box comes up; you open it, then another and it goes on and on. And the smaller the box, the more difficult it is to throw it, because it becomes subtler and subtler. So it is better to 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nthrow the whole box, the big one, because it contains all the smaller ones.\nThat's why people think I am destroying their religions. In a way they are right, because I am telling people to throw the whole box. It contains all their ideals, their churches, their temples, their Gitas, their Bibles, their Korans and I am telling them to throw it wholesale -- don't go retail!

also means symbolically, loyal heart.</p><p>The phenomenon of bliss has a few basic requirements, and these two
are very important: courage and loyalty. And both belong to the heart.
The mind is always a coward and the mind is always full of doubts.</p><p>Cowardliness and doubting are two sides of the same coin, and in the
same way courage and trust are two sides of the same coin.</p><p>Sannyas means changing the gestalt, the pattern of your energy,
shifting yourself from the head to the heart. The moment you start
living through the heart, life is blissful -- that is a by-product. If
you live through the head life is a misery -- that too is a by-product.
The head is impotent in creating bliss -- and we are all trying to do
that, hence the tremendous failure of humanity.</p><p>It is not only a question of a few individuals; the whole of humanity
is at a loss now. We have tried for centuries to live through the head
and we have created deeper and deeper misery. We have made the earth a
hell, now it is the time that, rather than going on the same track, in
the same vicious circle, we change the</p><p>whole energy pattern. Man needs a rebirth, a radical change. The
future belongs to the heart; and my effort here is to help you to bring
your energy from the head to the heart. Once it is there, life is a

full of life.</p><p>People are alive only at the minimum. The difference between death
and life is not much. People are existing only on the boundary line --
just a little accident and they are no more. Why people have decided to
live at the minimum is one of the most significant questions worth
pondering over.</p><p>There is a Sufi story: a king made a palace only with one door, there
was not even a window, so that he could be absolutely safe. That one
door was guarded by a big military force and over that military force
there was another force to supervise, and then another force to
supervise them; so three circles of military forces were guarding only
one door.</p><p>One of the king's friends -- who was also a king -- visited him. He
had heard much about this palace and when he saw it he said 'It is
really safe. There is no possibility of any danger.'</p><p>When he was departing the owner of the palace came out to give him a
send-off and again the guest praised the palace and he said 'I will also
make a palace like this.' A beggar sitting on the street started
laughing. They both asked him 'Why are you laughing?' The king who owned
the palace said 'What is so funny about his praising my palace?' The man
said 'I am laughing because there is only one loophole -- that one door.
If you really want to be safe you be inside and let people make a wall
instead of a door -- then you will be absolutely safe. Right now you are
only ninety -- nine point nine per cent safe and that point one per cent
of danger is enough to kill a person. That's why I am laughing.'</p><p>The story is significant; it says people have started living at the
minimum to be</p><p>safe, to be secure. To live fully means to live dangerously, to live
fully means to live in insecurity, to live fully means to live at the
maximum. Then life is an adventure, then one never knows what is going
to happen; one cannot be predictable. But life is life only when you
live at the maximum, at the highest peak. Of course the danger is there
that if you fall from the peak you are gone forever, but that danger is
worthwhile, that risk is worthwhile. If one chooses not to take that
risk then one lives in vain; one only vegetates and calls it life.</p><p>Meditation is nothing but the process of helping you to go to the
ultimate peak of your energy, to transfer your energy from the minimum
to the maximum, from the valley to the peak. Hence meditation teaches
you to live dangerously, to live adventurously, to live like a gambler,
not like a businessman.</p><p>Sannyas is a gamble. It is risky, it is going into the unknown, into
the uncharted -</p><p>- but that's its beauty too. The very danger brings life.</p><p>Just the other day I was reading that a man, a very great criminal in
America, has died. His whole expertise was robbing banks; for his whole
life he was robbing banks. For almost forty years of the sixty-five
years of his life he was in goal, but he robbed all the big banks, he
was the most famous robber.</p><p>He has written a small autobiography and he says 'The most alive
moments in my life were when I was robbing a bank. I lived for those few
moments; all else was just a preparation to live. Those few moments when
I was robbing a bank, actually robbing -- the risk, the danger, the
wondering what was going to happen, whether I was going to succeed or
was going to be caught or killed... Those were the few moments I
lived!'</p><p>Now if this man had met me, then I would have told him to rob god.
Why are you just robbing the bank of America? The real risk is robbing
god, his kingdom</p><p>-- and that's the whole art of meditation. It makes you a master
thief. So get ready!</p><p>Prem Oscar. Prem moans love. Oscar means god's spear. Love is
certainly god's spear: it kills you -- but it resurrects you also. It
goes directly to the heart.</p><p>All that is needed is to be available to god, and by saying that I
simply mean to be available to existence</p><p>-- to me god and existence are synonymous -- to be available to the
sun, to the</p><p>wind, to the rain, to be available to all that is, to be open and
vulnerable. Then one day the spear comes and shatters you, just kills
you. But that death is the most precious thing in life. To be killed by
god is the greatest blessing because out of that death arises a totally
now kind of life.</p><p>In fact then you know that whatsoever you have been calling life was
not life. Compared to that your old life looks like death, your old
light looks like darkness, your old riches look like poverty. But we
have been brought up not to be vulnerable, not to be open, to remain
closed-fisted. We are brought up in fear, and fear is the only thing
that prevents love; fear is the direct opposite of love. To live in fear
is to live a loveless life, and a loveless life cannot taste god.</p><p>So drop all fears. There is nothing to fear because nothing can be
taken away from you. Remember one 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>fundamental law: that which you have really got cannot be taken away,
so only the non-essential can be taken away; the essential cannot be
taken away. It is part of your innermost existence, it is inseparably
one with you. There is no possibility of creating a division between the
essential and you. The essential means you -- the essence. That is your
real richness, and nobody can rob you of it, not even god; it is
impossible to lose it. And that to which you are clinging is bound to be
taken away -- if not today then tomorrow, is not tomorrow then the day
after tomorrow. And sooner it is taken, the better, because if it is not
taken soon then you will be worrying about it; once it is taken the
worry is finished. Then there is no more worry because all is gone, so
why bother? One can have a good sleep, can rest and relax.</p><p>God always comes as a death to the ego.</p><p>In the ancient Indian scriptures the master is called death, and it
is very significant because the master means one who is going to become
the door to god: god will enter through the master. The moment you are
in tune with the master you are available to god. The master is only a
device to bring you into a certain tuning so that the spear of god can
go directly to your heart.</p><p>And the most precious moment is when the ego dies and you are left
egoless. Egolessness is love. Then love flows for no reason at all. And
not to anybody in particular, it simply flows just as fragrance is
released from a flowers unaddressed, to whomsoever it may concern.</p><p>Suryodaya means sunrise.</p><p>I have chosen the colour red with all its shades for my sannyasins.
It symbolises sunrise, the reddening of the eastern horizon just before
the sun arrives. The East becomes full of colours, but they are all
shades of red. It is getting ready to welcome the sun. The night is
over, the birds have started singing, the flowers have started opening,
the people and the animals and the trees are waking up. Life is going
through a new birth.</p><p>The night has been a small death; the sun heralds the beginning of a
new day. Again life will celebrate and dance and sing, again there will
be love and joy and all that is beautiful and alive.</p><p>Sannyas is sunrise in the inner world, the early morning, the dawn,
the declaration that the night is over and that the day is just close
by, at hand -- get ready to welcome it!</p><p>Purvodaya means the rise of the East.</p><p>The East is a symbol for the inner, just as the West is the symbol
for the outer. The East represents religion, the West represents
science. Both are significant and a great meeting of the two is needed.
And it will be the greatest blessing for humanity when Rudyard Kipling
is proved wrong. He says, "East is East and West is West and n'er the
twain shall meet."</p><p>Ordinarily he looks right because how can the inner and the outer
meet, and how can science and religion meet? -- they look poles apart.
But those who dive deeper find a strange phenomenon, that all polarities
are joined together, already joined together, that all polar opposites
are really complementaries. It is just as the negative and the positive
poles of electricity cannot exist in separation -- they have to be
together. It is just as man and woman cannot exist separately, just as
night and day and summer and winter and life and death, are joined
together.</p><p>So it is not really a question of creating a synthesis between East
and West; it is only a question of discovering it -- it is already
there. But whether the meeting is</p><p>discovered or not, one thing has to be remembered -- that the West
has fulfilled its work, and now the time has come for the East to
contribute, otherwise humanity will remain lopsided.</p><p>The West has given science, technology, all that is needed to make
life comfortable on the outside; the East has to give its part, so that
life can be blissful inside. So a great rise of the East is immensely
needed and immediately needed.</p><p>And only when both have contributed in a balanced way can we discover
that they are complementary.</p><p>My effort here is to give you the keys of eastern mysticism.</p><p>It is not a coincidence that so many western intellectuals, artists,
painters, musicians, poets, scientists have gathered around me. It is
significant because only they can understand that which is missing. The
East is living in such poverty, in such an ugly state of affairs that it
has no time to think of higher things. It pays lip-service to the
Buddha, to Krishna, to Mahavira, to Lao Tzu, but it is only lip-service.
It has lost track of its <em>own</em> inheritance, so it doesn't feel
that it is missing something on the inner.</p><p>You can only feel that something is missed on the inner when the
outer is there; then in contrast you can see that the inner is missing.
If the outer is missing then you will never be able to see that the
inner is missing. When you are rich on the outside you can immediately
feel that inside you are poor.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>The East is poor on the outside, hence it cannot feel that the inner
is also poor -- they look alike, there is no contrast. So very few
people from the East will be benefitted by me. They will be benefitted
in a very round-about way: first the West has to be given the keys and
once the West starts becoming spiritually rich then these eastern people
will start learning from the West the same keys that</p><p>they always had with them but which they had completely forgotten
about.</p><p>To me, East does not mean just the East of today; to me it symbolizes
all the great spiritual experiences that happened in the East. And
tremendous is the contribution of Lao Tzu, Chuang Tzu, Lieh Tzu, Buddha,
Mahavira, Krishna, Kabir -- tremendous is the contribution. But the East
is not in a state to understand it.</p><p>The West is in a state now to understand it. For the first time in
the West it is possible to understand Lao Tzu, Zen, Yoga, Tantra.</p><p>The East has to rise in the West. It looks very contradictory but
that's how it is: the sun has to rise in the West. And that's what is
slowly happening here. And in the new commune it is going to happen on a
vaster scale.</p><p>You all have to be aware that you are participating in something
tremendously important. Its significance will become clear only very
much later on; only history will be able to look back and see its
importance, because only later on can you see, with a bigger
perspective, what has happened. When it is actually happening nobody is
capable of understanding unless one is awakened.</p><p>I have heard that when Jesus was born Joseph came in and was very
much puzzled because Mary was crying and weeping. He said "What are you
doing? You have given birth to such a beautiful child and you are
crying..." She said "Yes, because I always wanted a girl!"</p><p>It is difficult, when Jesus is there it is difficult. Even his mother
is crying!</p><p>So this country is not going to understand me, the East is not going
to understand me; on the contrary they will condemn me. I have to depend
on the West. But my work consists in giving birth, a rebirth, to the
East.</p><p>Prem Arti. Prem means love. Arti means worship, prayer.</p><p>Love is the only true worship. One need not go to any church or
synagogue or temple, one has just to become loving. Love needs no
belief, no theology, no priest. We are born with the energy, we just
have to be courageous enough to share it.</p><p>And one has to share it not only with the person one has fallen in
love with --</p><p>because when you make your love very narrow and limited your soul
also becomes very narrow and limited. When love becomes exclusive then
it starts dying. It has to be inclusive, it has to include all, only
then does it reach to its full flowering, then it rises to the highest
peak, it becomes an Everest.</p><p>So love the people you are in love with, but love strangers too. And
not only people -- love animals, trees, rocks, stars. In short, simply
love -- don't be bothered about to whom it is addressed. Any excuse is
enough and one should be loving. And if there is no excuse, invent
excuses, but be loving!</p><p>The whole emphasis is on being loving. And these are the three
stages: first, love is one-pointed, exclusive; second, one becomes
loving, inclusive, and third, one simply becomes love. That is the
moment when it becomes worship and that is the moment when one becomes
aware of god.</p><p>Satish means, your very being is God. Sat means being, ish means
God.</p><p>God is not something outside you, God is your very being. And one has
to discover God inside oneself.</p><p>Going anywhere is pointless unless you go in. Every journey to some
other place is an escape from yourself; you are going farther away from
God. When you are not going anywhere, not even in thoughts and dreams
and desires, when all journeying, physical and psychological, has come
to a full stop -- when all journeying as such has stopped -- suddenly
you discover that which has always been there, but you were never there
so the meeting was not happening. It is at the very center of your
existence that God is luminous.</p><p>Once he has been found there then you can find him everywhere else,
but first he has to be found within.</p><p>Then he is in every person, every animal, every tree, every rock;
then he is all over the place. And to know that your being and the being
of the whole universe are one, brings tremendous rejoicing. All fear
disappears, all worry disappears, all anxiety disappears because now
there is no death: you have become part of the eternal. You are no more
a part, you have become the whole.</p><p>Kavya Gunjano. Kavya means poetry. Gunjano means humming. 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>Man is made of music. There is a deep humming inside. We are made of
that song -- it is wordless it is pure sound, hence I call it humming.
It has no meaning but tremendous significance. You cannot interpret it,
you cannot describe it, you cannot define it, but once you have
experienced it your life becomes luminous you are glowing with it, it is
a glory. It brings a new shine to your being, a new flavour and
fragrance.</p><p>This is one of the secret discoveries of all the mystics, that
basically life is poetry, not prose, music, not mathematics, mystery,
not science. And when the whole mind has ceased and there is no
functioning of the mind, then you can hear that humming sound rising
upwards from the depths of your being. One becomes overwhelmed by it.
One feels renewed, reborn -- it is so refreshing, it is such a
rejuvenation. One is bathed with the divine.</p><p>In the East we have called that humming 'omkar': the sound of om. The
sound of om comes closest to it</p><p>-- it is not exactly it, but approximately it. If you hum 'om,
om...', then it gives you some feel of it, but just approximately, not
exactly.</p><p>So get more and more in tune with poetry and music and get out of the
mind. Dance and sing and celebrate with great abandon. That is going to
be your meditation, that is going to be your entry into sannyas: be
drunk.</p><p>I am inviting all kinds of dangerous people -- gamblers, drunkards,
crazy cuckoos all kinds of people (much laughter). but they are the most
beautiful people in the world. The so-called sane are just ugly; they
are too sane to be alive, to calculative, too Jewish -- they cannot be
human!</p><p>Satyam means the truth.</p><p>Truth is not something which can be found by philosophizing, it is
not a conclusion of thought; on the contrary it is a realization of
no-thought. Philosophy is a distraction: one has to stop
philosophizing.</p><p>Just today I was reading one of Rudolf Steiner's statements that "If
a German comes to a crossroad and one sign says 'heaven' and the other
says 'lecture about heaven', the German always goes to the lecture about
heaven." Philosophy is that kind of thing; a lecture about the
truth.</p><p>Be less a thinker and more an experiencer. That's my fundamental
message, be existential. Intellect can go on round and round but it
never reaches the real thing. It cannot, it's not possible for it. Truth
has to be found in a state of no- mind, so the whole work here consists
in putting the mind aside, in living beyond mind, in just living and
rejoicing in living without thinking about it.</p><p>And it is not only true about Germans, it is true about almost
everybody in the world; particularly about the educated people. And
unfortunately now almost everybody, more or less, is educated. For one
hundred years universal education has been the slogan of the social
reformers and the missionaries and the servants of the people and they
have almost educated everybody. Now everybody is thinking and nobody is
living.</p><p>D.H. Lawrence has a good suggestion that if we could close all the
schools and all the universities for one hundred years then there would
be hope for humanity. I agree perfectly with him; it would be a
tremendously beautiful experiment. For a hundred years all Oxfords and
Cambridges and all schools and colleges from Kindergarten to the
university, would be closed -- a one-hundred-year holiday! And in those
one hundred years man would regain his primitiveness, his authenticity,
his existential status. And I don't think that man will open those
schools and colleges again -- ever!</p><p>Truth is within you, just be silent and know it. It is a question of
being silent and knowing. Thinking keeps you occupied, so much so that
you cannot know that truth is already inside you, it is already the
case.</p><p>Satyodaya means the rise of truth.</p><p>Man has lived in beliefs for centuries, and beliefs have deprived man
of truth. To believe simply means to be untruthful. One believes only
because one does not know, if one knows, there is no need to
believe.</p><p>For example, I don't believe in god, because I know -- there is no
need to believe. The man with eyes does not believe in light, he knows
it; but the blind man believes. He believes there is light, there are
colours and there are people</p><p>with eyes -- that is his belief.</p><p>Belief is a deception, it keeps you deluded. Truth can rise in you if
you are ready to drop all the beliefs</p><p>-- Christian, Hindu, Mohammedan, Buddhist. One should not choose.
Without any choice put all the beliefs in one bag and throw them into
the ocean. And do it in a single blow, don't go gradually, slowly slowly
throwing one belief and then another, then another -- because then it
will take many lives to get rid of them.</p><p>There are millions of beliefs, beliefs within beliefs. They are like
Chinese boxes, boxes within boxes: you open one and throw it, another
box comes up; you open it, then another and it goes on and on. And the
smaller the box, the more difficult it is to throw it, because it
becomes subtler and subtler. So it is better to 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-4>Osho's books on

ones.</p><p>That's why people think I am destroying their religions. In a way
they are right, because I am telling people to throw the whole box. It
contains all their ideals, their churches, their temples, their Gitas,
their Bibles, their Korans and I am telling them to throw it wholesale
-- don't go retail! Go all the way in a single step and be finished with
it and you will be surprised: the moment all beliefs are dropped
suddenly there is a totally new light arising in you which you have
never been aware of -- and that is truth. That truth liberates and that
truth brings blessings and benediction.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=is-the-grass-really-greener...>Is the Grass Really Greener...?</h3><p>Chapter #23</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part20>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

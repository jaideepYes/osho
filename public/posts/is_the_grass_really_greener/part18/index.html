It is for reference purposes only.]\nAnand Renate. Anand means bliss. Renate means reborn, born anew.\nMan brings tremendous bliss with himself but only as a potential, as a seed; it needs the right atmosphere, the climate, the soil, to grow. And society does not allow it to grow, it wants miserable people.\nThere is some reason why all societies all over the world in the whole past of humanity have wanted miserable people.\nFirst, the miserable person is always dependent; he is dependent on the parents, he is dependent on the priest, he is dependent on the state, dependent on the politician. He basically hankers for dependence; he is not able to stand on his own. He cannot trust himself. He is in such a misery -- how can he trust himself, his intelligence? He lives in distrust of himself; he knows that I'am unworthy, I have failed, whatsoever I do goes wrong, everything turns sour, so it is better to listen to those who are in power.'\nIt is one of the basic needs of the establishment to keep people miserable, only then will they be dependent. And when they are dependent they are obedient too; they cannot risk disobedience, they cannot revolt. They are trembling inside with\nfear; their guts are destroyed, their courage is crippled. And whenever there has been a blissful person he has been a danger to the establishment. The society has learned that.\nJesus was a danger, Buddha was a danger, Lao Tzu was a danger. So it is better to cut from the very roots all possibilities of somebody ever becoming a rebel. And the best way that they have found is to keep people in misery. In misery they cannot bring their potential to actuality. And unless one becomes actual, a flowering, one is missing the whole opportunity of life. One is not really born; only physically is one born, but spiritually one is still in the womb.\nSannyas means a spiritual birth. And the beginning of that birth is to learn the art of being blissful Rejoice -- there is much to rejoice in. We just have to decide that we will start looking for all that helps blissfulness. It is only a question of choosing. There are thorns, there are roses; the miserable person chooses the thorns, the person who decides to be blissful chooses the roses. And then a miracle starts happening: the more full of roses you are, the less thorns there are. When the whole being is full of roses thorns simply disappear, they don't exist any more for you. For the blissful person there is no misery anywhere; for the enlightened person there is no darkness anywhere, for the really alive there is no death.\nAmano Robert. Amano means no-mind. Robert means bright, intelligent.\nMind is intellect, not intelligence. Intellect is a poor substitute for intelligence; and they are diametrically opposite. Intellect is brought in from the outside. That's what we go on doing in the schools, 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\ncolleges, universities, we create intellect. And as a person becomes more intellectual his own intelligence remains in a latent form. So much intellect is piled upon the intelligence that one tends to forget all about it.\nIntellectual people are basically unintelligent people.\nIt is very rare to find a scholar, a professor, who is intelligent. I never came across one; as a student I never came across a single professor who was really intelligent. Then I became a professor in a university; for nine years I searched and searched but I could not find a single professor who was really intelligent --\nthey were intellectual.\nIf you are intellectual it means, you are full of readymade answers, so if the situation is old, which it never is, then you have the answer, but if the situation is new, you are at a loss. Intelligence means spontaneous responsibility, the capacity to respond to the new. Intellect means carrying readymade answers like a computer.\nA computer can never be intelligent. It can have immense intellect, more than any man can ever have. A computer can be fed all kinds of information -- its memory is infinite -- it can store everything that you go on feeding it and whenever you need it, just the push of a button and the answer is there. But a computer can never be intelligent. Any new situation for which the answer has not already been put into the computer and the computer will be at a loss. It may be a small thing, a very small thing, but the computer will not be able to cope with it. And that's what our scholars, professors, pundits, priests, the so-called learned people are: computers.\nThey have no spontaneity; parrotlike they go on repeating answers that they have collected from the scriptures, from every possible source.\nIntelligence is a totally different thing. You have to put intellect aside so that you can be alert, aware, of the situation; and the answer has to come from your being not from your memory, then the answer is immediate and it is always right. You respond with your total heart, with your wholeness, and then there is never any repentance. Whether you succeed or fail, that is irrelevant, but intelligence never repents because whatsoever was possible you did totally, there was nothing more for you to do. You were not holding anything back, you went into it totally.\nAmano, no-mind, helps you to bring your intelligence to the surface. Mind represses your intelligence.\nWe have yet to discover the right method of education in which intelligence is more significant than intellect. Right now things are upside-down; nobody bothers about intelligence; the whole system is to cultivate intellect. That is not\nthe meaning of the word 'education'; it is not education, it is MISeducation.\nEducation means to draw out. Certainly this is not what is happening in the universities and the colleges and the schools. We are not drawing out anything from the person; we are stuffing him from the outside. It is as if we go on throwing rocks into a well; sooner or later the well will be covered with rocks, there will be no water available. That's what has happened to man; in the name of education we have been putting rocks upon rocks into him and behind those rocks his intelligence is almost lost.\nThe function of meditation is to withdraw all those rocks, to take you to your original source, to the very springs of your life -- and then a person is intelligent. Every person can be utterly intelligent, one just has to be ready to put the mind aside. And that's my whole work here, to help you to put the mind aside, to shift your energy from the head to the heart, from mind to no-mind.\nOnce the energy starts functioning without the mind, your whole life has the flavor of intelligence, awareness, brightness. You are fully alive to the moment -- and that brings bliss, that brings thousands of blessings.\nDhyan Toni. Dhyan means meditation. Toni means inestimable.\nMind is limited; it can be estimated, it can be measured. Meditation is immeasurable, inestimable.\nMeditation is when the mind stops functioning, when all the noise of the mind and the traffic of the mind disappears, when there is pure silence and you are just a witness, not thinking, not feeling, but just being.\nThat silence and that being is meditation. That state opens the doors of the divine. Suddenly you are open to the infinity, to the eternal, to all that is.\nToni also has a few other meanings -- it is a beautiful word. It also means priceless. Meditation cannot be purchased; you have to earn it, you have to deserve it. Money cannot purchase it, power cannot snatch it, otherwise the Alexanders would have been the greatest meditators and the Rockefellers would have purchased all the meditation available in the world. But there is no way to purchase it, no ways to catch hold of it. You have to become worthy of it. For that a certain inner transformation is needed; nothing else can be of any help.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nAnd Toni also means beyond praise.\nWhatsoever we say about meditation falls short. All words prove to be inadequate. It remains indefinable, it remains beyond praise, it remains beyond all expression.\nOne Zen master was asked by a learned scholar 'What is meditation?' The master was sitting on the sand by the bank of a river. He remained as if nothing had been asked, as if nobody had come. He didn't take any notice of the scholar or his question. The scholar said 'What is the matter? Are you dead or something?' The master said 'I have answered your question; you asked me \"What is meditation?\" and I showed you: it is silence. If I say something it will be untrue. The moment you say something about meditation it becomes untrue, that's why I remained silent. I showed you, I was meditation, but you massed the point. You were waiting for some words, and meditation is not anything which can be caught in the net of words.\nSo we cannot praise it, we cannot purchase it, we cannot measure it. Because we cannot purchase it and cannot praise it and cannot measure it, it is the only thing worth having, it is the only treasure worth possessing. It is what Jesus means when he says the kingdom of god.\nPremda means one who is capable of giving love.\nThe world can be full of love but it is absolutely loveless; it is full of hate instead, and for the very simple reason that everybody wants love but nobody gives it. If everybody wants it and nobody gives it, then how can love happen? -- it is impossible. We have to change the whole arithmetics everybody should give and nobody should want.\nIf it comes without desiring, be thankful; if it does not come, accept that it is not coming, that 'Perhaps this is not the right time, perhaps I don't deserve it, perhaps\nI have to wait a little more,' but don't desire.\nEven when love is not coming, go on giving. And it is absolutely certain that when you give, you get and you get a thousandfold, not less than that.\nThe whole of existence loves the lover. The lover is the most precious being in existence, so the whole of existence showers love on him, it rejoices with him. If you go on giving love to people, even to strangers, to animals, to birds, to trees, to rocks, they will all respond and from thousands of directions love will start coming towards you -- it will bounce back! And then you will be so full of love that you would like to give because now you know the more you give, the more you have.\nUp to now humanity has lived a very loveless existence for the simple reason that everybody wants, tries to snatch, to steal and in every possible way to force the other to give to them. Everybody wants; and not only helpless people, even powerful people are asking for love. If it were a small child asking love from his parents, one could understand it; but even parents are asking for love from the small child.\nThe mother comes and wants the small child to smile and to welcome her and the poor child may not be in a state to smile at all, but he has to smile. He starts learning diplomacy; he smiles, he simply stretches his lips. He may be ready to cry, he may be hungry, but he smiles because he knows that a smile works. If the mother is happy then he may get some love, some food, otherwise he will be ignored. And the mother also goes on doing that, bribing the child: whenever he is showing love she will feed him, hug him, and whenever the child is not showing love she will punish him, in a thousand and one ways she will ignore him, neglect him.\nSo from his very childhood the child is surrounded by beggars. They are all asking 'Give us love! I am your -- daddy, I am your mummy -- give me love!' The poor child has no idea what is happening, but he has to pretend at least. From that moment he pretends for his whole life, he will be a hypocrite. Then one day he will show love to his wife without feeling any love, because if you don't show love to your wife she will create trouble. She may put more salt in your vegetables (laughter), she may give you tea without sugar; she will devise all kinds of strategies. She will throw things and she will break pots and she will create chaos.\nSo it is better, just to keep things silent (The crash from the region of Vrindavan canteen -- which runs under the hand and heart of Italian Deeksha -- could hardly be better timed. The group in front of Osho bursts into laughter, and Osho grins.)... This is mother Deeksha! (much laughter) She immediately did some... (Osho's sentence peters off as more laughter breaks out.) And this goes on for the whole of one's life. When you are old you are trying to get love and pretending that you love, and others are also pretending that they love you, so the whole of life becomes pretentious, phony.\nAnd to live a phony life is not to live at all. It is better to commit suicide than to live a phony life, because at least suicide will be authentic, not phony. Nobody can commit a phony suicide. People try that too, particularly women. They will take sleeping pills but always such a quantity that they don't die!\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\n(laughter) That is phony suicide, a phony attempted suicide, we should call it.\nGive love and don't ask. Give authentically -- that's the way of sannyas -- and you will be rewarded.\nThat is without any question, that is inevitable. But one has to know it by experience whether what I am saying works or not.\nHere you can see so much love, so much over-flowing love, because everybody is giving it and nobody is trying to snatch. Those who are trying to snatch are miserable even here, in this place where love is the only rule, the only discipline. Here also are a few people who are sitting thirsty on the bank of the river, crying and weeping. But sooner or later they learn that this is stupid: when everybody is jumping in the river, why waste time? It is hesitantly, but one day they jump. Once they have jumped suddenly they become aware that they have been unnecessarily sitting and waiting for somebody to come and give love to them. There is nobody to come and give love to you, unless you go and give it to others. Then they will respond. Whatsoever you give comes back to you, and a\nthousandfold.\nVeet Manu. Veet means transcending. Manu means mind.\nSannyas can be defined as a transcendence of the mind. Mind is the root cause of all our misery. Mind means the past, the future, memories and desires. All our thoughts are either memories or desires, and existence is now; it is neither past nor future. It is never past, never future; it is always present, it is always now, and the mind does not know how to be herenow. And it cannot be taught to be here and now. Its very construction is such that it can exist only in the past or in the future.\nIn the present what exists is a state of no-mind. You can try it any moment, just be silent, utterly herenow, and you will be surprised: there is no mind. Memories have been put aside, desires have been put aside and in the gap between the memory and the desire the whole existence opens up. But it is not mind, it is not thought, it is reality itself.\nThe experience of this reality is meditation. The moment you have experienced it you know that reality and god are synonymous. You can call it god if you like, you can call it truth if you like, you can call it liberation, freedom, but all these words simply indicate one thing: the real.\nMind is the unreal, the world of the unreal, as we have to come out of the unreal to meet, to merge, to melt into the real.\nPankaj means a lotus, but the English word 'lotus does not have that quality which the Sanskrit word\n'pankaj' has. 'Pank' means the mud and 'pankaj' means born out of the mud.\nThe lotus arises out of mud; hence it contains a significant message: we are mud but we can be lotuses also. That potential is there.\nThe Hebrew word 'Adam' means mud, in fact, red mud, because the earth in Israel is red. And god of course created the first man in Israel and out of red mud. God must have loved red as I love it! (laughter) Otherwise why bother to go to Israel? He could have found mud anywhere, but if you are looking for red mud you have to go to Israel.\nMan is nothing but mud; the lotus is only a potentiality. It is possible if we work for it, but if we don't work for it we will remain mud and we will be lost in mud.\nSannyas means making a deliberate effort to transform the mud into a lotus. And the lotus is the greatest flower, it is incomparable. No other flower is so big, no other flower is so fragrant. It is the emperor of all flowers; hence it has become symbolic of Buddhahood, because when consciousness unfolds in the mud of the ordinary humanity it is a one-thousand petalled lotus. It is such a revolution from the mud to the lotus; it is unbelievable that out of dirty mud such a delicate flower can arise.\nThat's why Buddhas have always been suspected, people can't believe it, because they are aware of their muddiness but they have no idea of their lotusness. So when somebody's lotus opens up they cannot believe it, they think it is just illusion: either the person is deluding himself or he is trying to deceive others. People could not believe in Jesus, people could not believe in Socrates, people could not believe in Pythagoras --\npeople have never believed in any Buddha for the simple reason -- and it is understandable too -- that they are just mud. How can they believe that out of such mud -- lust, greed, anger, hate -- such compassion, such love, such prayer can arise? Impossible! It seems illogical. But if one accepts the possibility even hypothetically then a search begins.\nSo I don't say believe in the existence of the Buddhas; I say only hypothetically assume that perhaps that is a possibility. That 'perhaps' will open a door in you. You will be able to know only when the lotus has opened in you. Unless one is a Buddha oneself one cannot understand any other Buddha. There is no other 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- way.\nSo my effort here is not to make you Christians but Christs, not Buddhists but Buddhas, because unless you have experienced it within your being all the\nstories of those great, fragrant people will remain only stories. They are beautiful stories, but not factual, not real -- fables. And I say to you they are not fables, they are realities. But I don't want you to believe in them -- I want you to experience those realities.\nNilima literally means blueness, but symbolically it is of immense significance. It symbolises two things; one is depth.\nWhenever water is deep it starts looking blue. When it is shallow it does not have the colour blue but depth gives it the colour blue. Scientists say the sky is not blue, it has no colour but it looks blue because it is so infinite; such depth, such infinity, gives it the colour of blue. Blueness represents depth, infinite depth.\nAnd we are as infinite as the sky! Even the sky is not the limit. We are as deep as the Pacific, perhaps the Pacific is not as deep as we are -- it is only five miles deep. That is not much of a depth. But our consciousness has no bottom to it, it is abysmal. Hence when one enters into one's inner space one feels tremendous blueness. It is an existential experience. When one turns in one finds such blueness as one has never seen before: the blueness of the sky fades away, the blueness of deep, dark waters is nothing compared to the inner blueness.\nSecondly, man has a few centres from where energy functions. There are many centres but the main centres are seven. The lowest is the sex centre, where almost everybody is hung up because we are born out of sexuality. So the sex centre is our inheritance. Only that centre is functioning. Unless we start working on our energy other centres remain dormant. If one goes on living at the sex centre one lives at the lowest point of the ladder. The highest centre is the seventh which in the East is called 'sahasrar', because it is at the seventh that the one-thousand petalled lotus opens.\nThe name 'sahasrar' means one-thousand petalled. It remains closed if the energy is somewhere lower.\nThree centres are the lower centres, three centres are the higher centres, and one is exactly in the middle.\nThe middle centre is the heart, the centre of love.\nWhen sex starts becoming love, then your heart opens up. That's a great jump;\nthat is moving from sex to love. It is really a great achievement. To move from the centre of love to the seventh centre one has to pass one more very significant centre -- that is the sixth. That is called the third eye centre; it is exactly between the two eyes. And when your energy reaches the third eye centre it becomes a blue flame, it actually becomes a blue flame. It is very cool although it is a flame; it is fire but cool fire. That is the last that man can achieve, the sixth centre, and the seventh happens on its own. When the whole energy has moved to the sixth and has become a blue flame -- and a flame naturally rises upwards on its own it moves upwards -- that flame moving upwards at a certain point, at a certain intensity opens the seventh centre and one is freed from all misery, all limitation, all bondage.\nSo Nilima, blueness, has these two meanings. First, infinite depth; second, the blue light that is the ultimate achievement of one's efforts in meditation. It is at the sixth centre that your energy becomes prayer.\nAnd once your energy has moved from sex to love, from love to prayer, you have done whatsoever you could do.

Chuang Tzu Auditorium</h3><p>Archive code: 8012185 ShortTitle: GREENR19 Audio:</p><p>No Video:</p><p>No</p><p>[NOTE: This is an unedited tape transcript of an unpublished darshan
diary, which has been scanned and cleaned up. It is for reference
purposes only.]</p><p>Anand Renate. Anand means bliss. Renate means reborn, born anew.</p><p>Man brings tremendous bliss with himself but only as a potential, as
a seed; it needs the right atmosphere, the climate, the soil, to grow.
And society does not allow it to grow, it wants miserable people.</p><p>There is some reason why all societies all over the world in the
whole past of humanity have wanted miserable people.</p><p>First, the miserable person is always dependent; he is dependent on
the parents, he is dependent on the priest, he is dependent on the
state, dependent on the politician. He basically hankers for dependence;
he is not able to stand on his own. He cannot trust himself. He is in
such a misery -- how can he trust himself, his intelligence? He lives in
distrust of himself; he knows that I'am unworthy, I have failed,
whatsoever I do goes wrong, everything turns sour, so it is better to
listen to those who are in power.'</p><p>It is one of the basic needs of the establishment to keep people
miserable, only then will they be dependent. And when they are dependent
they are obedient too; they cannot risk disobedience, they cannot
revolt. They are trembling inside with</p><p>fear; their guts are destroyed, their courage is crippled. And
whenever there has been a blissful person he has been a danger to the
establishment. The society has learned that.</p><p>Jesus was a danger, Buddha was a danger, Lao Tzu was a danger. So it
is better to cut from the very roots all possibilities of somebody ever
becoming a rebel. And the best way that they have found is to keep
people in misery. In misery they cannot bring their potential to
actuality. And unless one becomes actual, a flowering, one is missing
the whole opportunity of life. One is not really born; only physically
is one born, but spiritually one is still in the womb.</p><p>Sannyas means a spiritual birth. And the beginning of that birth is
to learn the art of being blissful Rejoice -- there is much to rejoice
in. We just have to decide that we will start looking for all that helps
blissfulness. It is only a question of choosing. There are thorns, there
are roses; the miserable person chooses the thorns, the person who
decides to be blissful chooses the roses. And then a miracle starts
happening: the more full of roses you are, the less thorns there are.
When the whole being is full of roses thorns simply disappear, they
don't exist any more for you. For the blissful person there is no misery
anywhere; for the enlightened person there is no darkness anywhere, for
the really alive there is no death.</p><p>Amano Robert. Amano means no-mind. Robert means bright,
intelligent.</p><p>Mind is intellect, not intelligence. Intellect is a poor substitute
for intelligence; and they are diametrically opposite. Intellect is
brought in from the outside. That's what we go on doing in the schools,
1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>colleges, universities, we create intellect. And as a person becomes
more intellectual his own intelligence remains in a latent form. So much
intellect is piled upon the intelligence that one tends to forget all
about it.</p><p>Intellectual people are basically unintelligent people.</p><p>It is very rare to find a scholar, a professor, who is intelligent. I
never came across one; as a student I never came across a single
professor who was really intelligent. Then I became a professor in a
university; for nine years I searched and searched but I could not find
a single professor who was really intelligent --</p><p>they were intellectual.</p><p>If you are intellectual it means, you are full of readymade answers,
so if the situation is old, which it never is, then you have the answer,
but if the situation is new, you are at a loss. Intelligence means
spontaneous responsibility, the capacity to respond to the new.
Intellect means carrying readymade answers like a computer.</p><p>A computer can never be intelligent. It can have immense intellect,
more than any man can ever have. A computer can be fed all kinds of
information -- its memory is infinite -- it can store everything that
you go on feeding it and whenever you need it, just the push of a button
and the answer is there. But a computer can never be intelligent. Any
new situation for which the answer has not already been put into the
computer and the computer will be at a loss. It may be a small thing, a
very small thing, but the computer will not be able to cope with it. And
that's what our scholars, professors, pundits, priests, the so-called
learned people are: computers.</p><p>They have no spontaneity; parrotlike they go on repeating answers
that they have collected from the scriptures, from every possible
source.</p><p>Intelligence is a totally different thing. You have to put intellect
aside so that you can be alert, aware, of the situation; and the answer
has to come from your being not from your memory, then the answer is
immediate and it is always right. You respond with your total heart,
with your wholeness, and then there is never any repentance. Whether you
succeed or fail, that is irrelevant, but intelligence never repents
because whatsoever was possible you did totally, there was nothing more
for you to do. You were not holding anything back, you went into it
totally.</p><p>Amano, no-mind, helps you to bring your intelligence to the surface.
Mind represses your intelligence.</p><p>We have yet to discover the right method of education in which
intelligence is more significant than intellect. Right now things are
upside-down; nobody bothers about intelligence; the whole system is to
cultivate intellect. That is not</p><p>the meaning of the word 'education'; it is not education, it is
MISeducation.</p><p>Education means to draw out. Certainly this is not what is happening
in the universities and the colleges and the schools. We are not drawing
out anything from the person; we are stuffing him from the outside. It
is as if we go on throwing rocks into a well; sooner or later the well
will be covered with rocks, there will be no water available. That's
what has happened to man; in the name of education we have been putting
rocks upon rocks into him and behind those rocks his intelligence is
almost lost.</p><p>The function of meditation is to withdraw all those rocks, to take
you to your original source, to the very springs of your life -- and
then a person is intelligent. Every person can be utterly intelligent,
one just has to be ready to put the mind aside. And that's my whole work
here, to help you to put the mind aside, to shift your energy from the
head to the heart, from mind to no-mind.</p><p>Once the energy starts functioning without the mind, your whole life
has the flavor of intelligence, awareness, brightness. You are fully
alive to the moment -- and that brings bliss, that brings thousands of
blessings.</p><p>Dhyan Toni. Dhyan means meditation. Toni means inestimable.</p><p>Mind is limited; it can be estimated, it can be measured. Meditation
is immeasurable, inestimable.</p><p>Meditation is when the mind stops functioning, when all the noise of
the mind and the traffic of the mind disappears, when there is pure
silence and you are just a witness, not thinking, not feeling, but just
being.</p><p>That silence and that being is meditation. That state opens the doors
of the divine. Suddenly you are open to the infinity, to the eternal, to
all that is.</p><p>Toni also has a few other meanings -- it is a beautiful word. It also
means priceless. Meditation cannot be purchased; you have to earn it,
you have to deserve it. Money cannot purchase it, power cannot snatch
it, otherwise the Alexanders would have been the greatest meditators and
the Rockefellers would have purchased all the meditation available in
the world. But there is no way to purchase it, no ways to catch hold of
it. You have to become worthy of it. For that a certain inner
transformation is needed; nothing else can be of any help.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>And Toni also means beyond praise.</p><p>Whatsoever we say about meditation falls short. All words prove to be
inadequate. It remains indefinable, it remains beyond praise, it remains
beyond all expression.</p><p>One Zen master was asked by a learned scholar 'What is meditation?'
The master was sitting on the sand by the bank of a river. He remained
as if nothing had been asked, as if nobody had come. He didn't take any
notice of the scholar or his question. The scholar said 'What is the
matter? Are you dead or something?' The master said 'I have answered
your question; you asked me "What is meditation?" and I showed you: it
is silence. If I say something it will be untrue. The moment you say
something about meditation it becomes untrue, that's why I remained
silent. I showed you, I <em>was</em> meditation, but you massed the
point. You were waiting for some words, and meditation is not anything
which can be caught in the net of words.</p><p>So we cannot praise it, we cannot purchase it, we cannot measure it.
Because we cannot purchase it and cannot praise it and cannot measure
it, it is the only thing worth having, it is the only treasure worth
possessing. It is what Jesus means when he says the kingdom of god.</p><p>Premda means one who is capable of giving love.</p><p>The world can be full of love but it is absolutely loveless; it is
full of hate instead, and for the very simple reason that everybody
wants love but nobody gives it. If everybody wants it and nobody gives
it, then how can love happen? -- it is impossible. We have to change the
whole arithmetics everybody should give and nobody should want.</p><p>If it comes without desiring, be thankful; if it does not come,
accept that it is not coming, that 'Perhaps this is not the right time,
perhaps I don't deserve it, perhaps</p><p>I have to wait a little more,' but don't desire.</p><p>Even when love is not coming, go on giving. And it is absolutely
certain that when you give, you get and you get a thousandfold, not less
than that.</p><p>The whole of existence loves the lover. The lover is the most
precious being in existence, so the whole of existence showers love on
him, it rejoices with him. If you go on giving love to people, even to
strangers, to animals, to birds, to trees, to rocks, they will
<em>all</em> respond and from thousands of directions love will start
coming towards you -- it will bounce back! And then you will be so full
of love that you would <em>like</em> to give because now you know the
more you give, the more you have.</p><p>Up to now humanity has lived a very loveless existence for the simple
reason that everybody wants, tries to snatch, to steal and in every
possible way to force the other to give to them. Everybody wants; and
not only helpless people, even powerful people are asking for love. If
it were a small child asking love from his parents, one could understand
it; but even parents are asking for love from the small child.</p><p>The mother comes and wants the small child to smile and to welcome
her and the poor child may not be in a state to smile at all, but he has
to smile. He starts learning diplomacy; he smiles, he simply stretches
his lips. He may be ready to cry, he may be hungry, but he smiles
because he knows that a smile works. If the mother is happy then he may
get some love, some food, otherwise he will be ignored. And the mother
also goes on doing that, bribing the child: whenever he is showing love
she will feed him, hug him, and whenever the child is not showing love
she will punish him, in a thousand and one ways she will ignore him,
neglect him.</p><p>So from his very childhood the child is surrounded by beggars. They
are all asking 'Give us love! I am your -- daddy, I am your mummy --
give me love!' The poor child has no idea what is happening, but he has
to pretend at least. From that moment he pretends for his whole life, he
will be a hypocrite. Then one day he will show love to his wife without
feeling any love, because if you don't show love to your wife she will
create trouble. She may put more salt in your vegetables (laughter), she
may give you tea without sugar; she will devise all kinds of strategies.
She will throw things and she will break pots and she will create
chaos.</p><p>So it is better, just to keep things silent (The crash from the
region of Vrindavan canteen -- which runs under the hand and heart of
Italian Deeksha -- could hardly be better timed. The group in front of
Osho bursts into laughter, and Osho grins.)... This is mother Deeksha!
(much laughter) She immediately did some... (Osho's sentence peters off
as more laughter breaks out.) And this goes on for the whole of one's
life. When you are old you are trying to get love and pretending that
you love, and others are also pretending that they love you, so the
whole of life becomes pretentious, phony.</p><p>And to live a phony life is not to live at all. It is better to
commit suicide than to live a phony life, because at least suicide will
be authentic, not phony. Nobody can commit a phony suicide. People try
that too, particularly women. They will take sleeping pills but always
such a quantity that they don't die!</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>(laughter) That is phony suicide, a phony attempted suicide, we
should call it.</p><p>Give love and don't ask. Give authentically -- that's the way of
sannyas -- and you will be rewarded.</p><p>That is without any question, that is inevitable. But one has to know
it by experience whether what I am saying works or not.</p><p>Here you can see so much love, so much over-flowing love, because
everybody is giving it and nobody is trying to snatch. Those who are
trying to snatch are miserable even here, in this place where love is
the only rule, the only discipline. Here also are a few people who are
sitting thirsty on the bank of the river, crying and weeping. But sooner
or later they learn that this is stupid: when everybody is jumping in
the river, why waste time? It is hesitantly, but one day they jump. Once
they have jumped suddenly they become aware that they have been
unnecessarily sitting and waiting for somebody to come and give love to
them. There is nobody to come and give love to you, unless <em>you</em>
go and give it to others. Then they will respond. Whatsoever you give
comes back to you, and a</p><p>thousandfold.</p><p>Veet Manu. Veet means transcending. Manu means mind.</p><p>Sannyas can be defined as a transcendence of the mind. Mind is the
root cause of all our misery. Mind means the past, the future, memories
and desires. All our thoughts are either memories or desires, and
existence is now; it is neither past nor future. It is never past, never
future; it is always present, it is always now, and the mind does not
know how to be herenow. And it cannot be taught to be here and now. Its
very construction is such that it can exist only in the past or in the
future.</p><p>In the present what exists is a state of no-mind. You can try it any
moment, just be silent, utterly herenow, and you will be surprised:
there is no mind. Memories have been put aside, desires have been put
aside and in the gap between the memory and the desire the whole
existence opens up. But it is not mind, it is not thought, it is reality
itself.</p><p>The experience of this reality is meditation. The moment you have
experienced it you know that reality and god are synonymous. You can
call it god if you like, you can call it truth if you like, you can call
it liberation, freedom, but all these words simply indicate one thing:
the real.</p><p>Mind is the unreal, the world of the unreal, as we have to come out
of the unreal to meet, to merge, to melt into the real.</p><p>Pankaj means a lotus, but the English word 'lotus does not have that
quality which the Sanskrit word</p><p>'pankaj' has. 'Pank' means the mud and 'pankaj' means born out of the
mud.</p><p>The lotus arises out of mud; hence it contains a significant message:
we <em>are</em> mud but we can be lotuses also. That potential is
there.</p><p>The Hebrew word 'Adam' means mud, in fact, red mud, because the earth
in Israel is red. And god of course created the first man in Israel and
out of red mud. God must have loved red as I love it! (laughter)
Otherwise why bother to go to Israel? He could have found mud anywhere,
but if you are looking for red mud you have to go to Israel.</p><p>Man is nothing but mud; the lotus is only a potentiality. It is
possible if we work for it, but if we don't work for it we will remain
mud and we will be lost in mud.</p><p>Sannyas means making a deliberate effort to transform the mud into a
lotus. And the lotus is the greatest flower, it is incomparable. No
other flower is so big, no other flower is so fragrant. It is the
emperor of all flowers; hence it has become symbolic of Buddhahood,
because when consciousness unfolds in the mud of the ordinary humanity
it is a one-thousand petalled lotus. It is such a revolution from the
mud to the lotus; it is unbelievable that out of dirty mud such a
delicate flower can arise.</p><p>That's why Buddhas have always been suspected, people can't believe
it, because they are aware of their muddiness but they have no idea of
their lotusness. So when somebody's lotus opens up they cannot believe
it, they think it is just illusion: either the person is deluding
himself or he is trying to deceive others. People could not believe in
Jesus, people could not believe in Socrates, people could not believe in
Pythagoras --</p><p>people have never believed in any Buddha for the simple reason -- and
it is understandable too -- that they are just mud. How can they believe
that out of such mud -- lust, greed, anger, hate -- such compassion,
such love, such prayer can arise? Impossible! It seems illogical. But if
one accepts the possibility even hypothetically then a search
begins.</p><p>So I don't say believe in the existence of the Buddhas; I say only
hypothetically assume that perhaps that is a possibility. That 'perhaps'
will open a door in you. You will be able to know only when the lotus
has opened in you. Unless one is a Buddha oneself one cannot understand
any other Buddha. There is no other 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:- way.</p><p>So my effort here is not to make you Christians but Christs, not
Buddhists but Buddhas, because unless you have experienced it within
your being all the</p><p>stories of those great, fragrant people will remain only stories.
They are beautiful stories, but not factual, not real -- fables. And I
say to you they are not fables, they are realities. But I don't want you
to believe in them -- I want you to experience those realities.</p><p>Nilima literally means blueness, but symbolically it is of immense
significance. It symbolises two things; one is depth.</p><p>Whenever water is deep it starts looking blue. When it is shallow it
does not have the colour blue but depth gives it the colour blue.
Scientists say the sky is not blue, it has no colour but it looks blue
because it is so infinite; such depth, such infinity, gives it the
colour of blue. Blueness represents depth, infinite depth.</p><p>And we are as infinite as the sky! Even the sky is not the limit. We
are as deep as the Pacific, perhaps the Pacific is not as deep as we are
-- it is only five miles deep. That is not much of a depth. But our
consciousness has no bottom to it, it is abysmal. Hence when one enters
into one's inner space one feels tremendous blueness. It is an
existential experience. When one turns in one finds such blueness as one
has never seen before: the blueness of the sky fades away, the blueness
of deep, dark waters is nothing compared to the inner blueness.</p><p>Secondly, man has a few centres from where energy functions. There
are many centres but the main centres are seven. The lowest is the sex
centre, where almost everybody is hung up because we are born out of
sexuality. So the sex centre is our inheritance. Only that centre is
functioning. Unless we start working on our energy other centres remain
dormant. If one goes on living at the sex centre one lives at the lowest
point of the ladder. The highest centre is the seventh which in the East
is called 'sahasrar', because it is at the seventh that the one-thousand
petalled lotus opens.</p><p>The name 'sahasrar' means one-thousand petalled. It remains closed if
the energy is somewhere lower.</p><p>Three centres are the lower centres, three centres are the higher
centres, and one is exactly in the middle.</p><p>The middle centre is the heart, the centre of love.</p><p>When sex starts becoming love, then your heart opens up. That's a
great jump;</p><p>that is moving from sex to love. It is really a great achievement. To
move from the centre of love to the seventh centre one has to pass one
more very significant centre -- that is the sixth. That is called the
third eye centre; it is exactly between the two eyes. And when your
energy reaches the third eye centre it becomes a blue flame, it actually
becomes a blue flame. It is very cool although it is a flame; it is fire
but cool fire. That is the last that man can achieve, the sixth centre,
and the seventh happens on its own. When the whole energy has moved to
the sixth and has become a blue flame -- and a flame naturally rises
upwards on its own it moves upwards -- that flame moving upwards at a
certain point, at a certain intensity opens the seventh centre and one
is freed from all misery, all limitation, all bondage.</p><p>So Nilima, blueness, has these two meanings. First, infinite depth;
second, the blue light that is the ultimate achievement of one's efforts
in meditation. It is at the sixth centre that your energy becomes
prayer.</p><p>And once your energy has moved from sex to love, from love to prayer,
you have done whatsoever <em>you</em> could do. Now everything is going
to happen of its own accord. You have come to the end of your effort;
now something will happen as the grace of the beyond. The flame will hit
the closed bud of the lotus and open it up.</p><p>And the fragrance released is the ultimate goal of life. There is
nothing higher than that.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:justify id=is-the-grass-really-greener...>Is the Grass Really Greener...?</h3><p>Chapter #20</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part17>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

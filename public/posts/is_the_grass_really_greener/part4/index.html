It is for reference purposes only.]\nDhyan Helen: Dhyan means meditation. Helen means light.\nMan without meditation is without light. He is just darkness. If one looks within without knowing the art of meditation one will find only darkness and darkness and nothing else. That's why nobody wants to look within. The Christs, the Buddhas, the Zarathustras, have been telling people to look within; Jesus goes on insisting that the kingdom of god is within you and Socrates says know thyself. People listen but nobody tries it because when they try the experience is not ecstatic, it is just terrible! (laughter) There is nothing but emptiness, darkness. One meets nobody -- no god, no kingdom of god. One goes with great expectations and just the opposite is the case.\nSo one pays polite, formal respect to these great teachers and goes on looking outside; the real world is there. But the reason why we miss is that to look inside one needs a certain discipline. It is like listening; to classical music: it needs a certain discipline, you need certain ears to listen to it, to understand it, to feel it, to see the beauty of it.\nMeditation is a whole art; it is the art of focussing inwards, it is the art of dropping the outside completely as if it has disappeared for the moment at least,\nit is illusory. When your total energy starts moving inside -- remember the word 'total' -- only then will you find light. And once you have found light within you have found god and the kingdom of god. That light transforms your whole life. It gives a new dance, a new song, to your being.\nDhyan Paul. Dhyan means meditation. Paul means rest. Meditation is a way of resting within yourself.\nMind is restlessness. Unless you go beyond the mind you cannot rest, hence meditation means transcending mind, transcending restlessness, being at ease, at home, utterly restful, as if there is nothing to do, nowhere to go, so blissfully in the moment -- that is with no past, no future, no thought, no memory, no desire, with not even a small ripple in your consciousness to go somewhere else.\nThe mind is always running, chasing shadows, mirages, far-away goals. It is ambitious, it is political; mind is a politician. To be in the mind is to be in continuous struggle, competition -- how can you rest? You can rest only when you understand the futility of ambition, the futility of desire, the futility of all goals, then suddenly your energy settles and rests at the very centre of your being. The circumference starts shrinking and becomes equal to the centre; there is no circumference, only the centre.\nWhen you are in the mind there is no control only the circumference, and the circumference goes on expanding. In meditation there is only the centre, no circumference -- and that is the moment of rest. And to know it is to know all, because by knowing it the door of the divine opens. It is a beautiful name -- it carries the whole secret of meditation.\nAnandi means blissful, cheerful, with laughter in the heart.\nThe religious people are ordinarily serious people. They have long faces, sad, sombre, because they are engaged in something very great, something divine, very superior to all the other activities people are involved in. The whole world is mundane and they are holy -- how can a holy person laugh? Impossible.\nLaughter seems to be the very essence of unholiness.\nChristians say, Jesus never laughed. Now there cannot be anything more false than that. If one asks me I will say he never stopped laughing, even on the cross he laughed. The last thing that he did was to laugh, to 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nhave a good laugh at the cosmic joke! God has ditched him beautifully! Thousands of people were waiting for the miracle and nothing happened! Can you find a better joke? Even he himself was waiting and looking again and again... and nothing happened!\nIf something had happened the whole point would have been lost, the punch line would have been missed! It was really beautiful of god not to interfere. For the whole of his life Jesus was doing miracles --\nraising the dead, giving eyes to the blind -- and at the last moment he could not manage anything! He must have laughed! And when they all met afterwards Jesus must have said, \"You did it!\"\nI can't see why he should not laugh at the last moment. But Christians go on saying he never laughed.\nThe statues they have made, the pictures, the paintings, are always serious. Those are not representative, they are false, they are inventions.\nTo me cheerfulness is the essence of religiousness. To take life as fun, to enjoy it, to love it and to accept it with all its thorns and flowers, with all its dark nights and beautiful days, to accept it in its totality is sannyas.\nYes, there is agony; it needs to be there, it balances ecstasy. Ecstasy alone will lose its taste. If one is ecstatic and never comes to know what agony is, one will start forgetting what ecstasy is. The ecstasy can be felt only when there is a background of agony. You can see the stars in the night only when there is darkness as a backdrop. In the day also they are there but the background is missing. It is so full of light that they disappear.\nOnce you understand life with its duality then even in pain, even in anguish, one has a cheerful heart because one understands; one understands the essentiality of the polar opposite. Then in success or failure one remains balanced, one's cheerfulness is not disturbed by anything.\nWhen Alexander came to India he wanted one sannyasin to go with him -- his name was Dandamis --\nbut the sannyasin refused. He said 'Nobody can force me'... because the way Alexander asked him to go was aggressive. He said 'either you come with me or I will kill you!' Dandamis said 'It is better you kill me, be finished with it -- I am not coming. Nobody can force me to do anything and death has no point as far as I am concerned; I died long ago.' And then he said 'Why are you waiting? Pull out your sword and cut off my head. You will see it falling on the ground and I will also see it. And you will hear my laughter. After my head has fallen you will hear my laughter!'\nAlexander could not kill him. For the first time he had come across a man who was simply amazing, what he was saying. And he said 'I am sorry. I should not have said it to you in such an aggressive way, this is just my habit because everybody has always followed my orders. But now I understand, there are people who cannot be forced. But can you please send some of your disciples with me?'\nDandamis said 'That's alright.' He called a disciple, his name was Kalyan, Kalyan Swami was his name.\nHe said 'Kalyan, you go with this fool.' Kalyan said 'Okay, master. Anyway I have to go.' Alexander could not understand what this talk was all about -- Kalyan had said 'Anyway I have to go.' Only later on did he understand, because on the way Kalyan Swami died. When he died he said 'Now do you understand? Do you understand or not? I told my master \"Anyway I have to go, so it doesn't matter.' He has sent a dead man with you! (laughter) He befooled you!'\nAlexander said 'But you Hindus believe in the immortality of the soul -- don't you think you will not die?' He said 'No, I will not die, and I will see you in Babylon and he died without explaining what he meant by 'I will see you in Babylon.' Alexander understood it only because he died in Babylon; when he was moving back to his home, on the way, in Babylon, he died. One of his advisers reminded him: 'That man was right! He said \"I will see you in Babylon.\"'\nThese people are cheerful people. Now Dandamis played a trick on Alexander -- sending a disciple who was already going to die within a few months. Then the\ndisciple played a trick on him; he said 'I will see you in Babylon.' He was just laughing about death -- it is nothing much to be serious about. Even death is not worth being serious about. But there are fools who think that even life is a serious affair; nothing is a serious affair.\nMy sannyasins have to learn to be cheerful in every situation -- good or bad. Even if you are thrown into hell, go laughing and your laughter will transform hell. This is my fundamental message: I want a religiousness in the world which knows how to laugh, how to be blissful, how to dance, how to celebrate.\nGandharvo means divine musician. In Indian mythology gandharvas are the musicians of god, they are heavenly musicians.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nMusic is divine. It is something that comes very close to meditation. Just one step more and you are in the world of meditation. Music is almost the boundary line between mind and meditation. Nothing comes closer because music is pure joy, it is festivity. Also it has no words. Words are limited, sounds have unlimited significance.\nAnd the beauty of music is that although it is sound it creates silence. That is the criterion to judge whether Music is real music or just pseudo. The pseudo means it is noisy; it simply disturbs you. Maybe the disturbance looks like excitement, but it is not of any great value. That's what the so-called pop music does: it touches only the superficial in you, the biological, the sexual; it does not go deep. The higher the music is, the more the sound starts doing a miracle: it creates silence. When the music creates silence in you, when listening to the sound silence is created, then one is truly a musician, then has heard the real music.\nMeditation can be expressed only through music. So learn the beauty of the sound, so that you can learn the beauty of silence. From sound to silence -- that is the way of the meditator. Just listen to this silence of the night. It is also sound,\nthe insects are creating a certain king of music but their sound does not disturb the silence; on the contrary, it enhances it, it enriches it. And life should be such that the paradoxical, the contradictory, becomes complimentary. Then your very life has a music, a harmony, and only in that harmony does one come to know the truth.\nShantiprem. Shanti means silence, prem means love. The moment these both happen together you have entered the world of miracles.\nLove is excitement, it is feverish -- that's why it is called passion. It is a little bit crazy, it drives you nuts! (laughter) Love alone is not enough. Silence is also needed to balance it, to give it some sanity, to make it less of a fever and more of a healthy phenomenon.\nSilence alone is dead. It is of a graveyard, it is not alive. Love is needed, then even on the grave roses start blooming. Love and silence together make a life a really rich life.\nAnd that's the work my sannyasins have to do, to create a rich life. I am against poverty -- and the greatest poverty is of the inner, the outer poverty will be removed sooner or later. Either science will remove it or nature will remove it, but it is going to be removed, it cannot remain for long. But the inner poverty, neither science can remove nor nature can remove. It has to be removed by the individual. Hence I have chosen the inner world and the work that is concerned with that.\nThe outer world is the concern of the politicians, the social workers, the so- called revolutionaries, scientists, technicians -- that is their work. My work is to change the inner world and to make it rich -- and richness happens only when love and silence meet. When love and silence are really merged into one organic unity you have come to know the greatest joy of life.\nVishram means relaxation.\nLife should be lived in a very relaxed way. There is no need to be in a hurry, there is no need to be always rushing. It is to no purpose at all, nothing is served by it. In fact it is a way of destroying your life, because once this rushing becomes your habit you are never where you are, you are always somewhere else, so your body is in one place, your mind is in some other place. And this distance between your body and mind creates anxiety, anguish, and never allows\nyou joy. Joy means to be here and now, so totally that there is no idea at all of being anywhere else or of being somebody else.\nTo feel relaxation is to feel the mystery of your being, because then you are available, unoccupied, utterly open and vulnerable. In a relaxed state you open up like a lotus flower -- to the sun, to the rain, to the wind, to all that is. And this whole is divine. God is not a person but only the totality of existence, the organic unity of all that is. But you can know it only when you are not in a rush, not in a hurry.\nSannyasins have to learn to relax, to drop this speedy neurosis. It is neurosis, it is driving people almost insane. Now psychologists say that out of four persons three are almost insane. And when out of four, three are insane, how long can the fourth remain sane? -- because he will have to live with the three! And the greatest insanity comes to people who have to live with insane people. The fourth cannot remain sane for long; he has to become part of the insanity, otherwise he cannot survive.\nI teach my sannyasins to be relaxed, because through relaxation sanity comes, awareness comes, peace comes, bliss comes, love comes and ultimately, the ultimate guest too: God comes!\nKavya means poetry.\nMy approach towards life is not that of a philosopher but that of a poet. Philosophy is something of the 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nmind -- rational, logical, but superficial. Poetry is of the heart -- it is not thinking, it is feelings it is not logic, it is love. And when you love life, when you feel life without the interference of the mind, you are in immediate contact with god.\nThe first step is to change your gears from the head to the heart, from being a philosopher... And everybody is a philosopher; a few people are \u0026cod\nphilosophers and a few people are bad philosophers --\nthat doesn't matter. A few people are very systematic philosophers and others are lousy, but all are philosophers, more or less, in some way or other; hence the first shift has to be from the head to the heart.\nThe poet stands between the philosopher and the mystic, the heart is exactly in between the head and the being so the heart is a necessary station, anyone who is going on the journey of being -- and that's what sannyas is all about -- first has to stop at the heart.\nOnce you have settled at the heart and mind is no more a disturbance, the second step is not difficult, very easy; then one starts moving from feeling to being. And once you have reached being sannyas is fulfilled.\nThe philosopher is the farthest from the truth; the poet is very close, the mystic has arrived -- he has found his home. But nobody can go bypassing the heart.\nSo start feeling more, thinking less, start loving more, dropping logic, calculation, arithmetic. This is half of the work, and the most hard part; the second part is very easy. If one has done the first part, the second happens very easily, very spontaneously. In fact nothing is needed to be done for the second; once you have started feeling you are bound to go through a new transformation.\nThe feeling slowly slowly disappears of its own accord and only being is left. When only you are, simply you are -- no thought, no feeling, just a pure existence -- then you are a mirror, and in that mirror reality is reflected as it is.\nVinamro means humble, simple, with no desire to be somebody, utterly at rest with being nobody.\nA sannyasin is a nobody. The only thing that he has to drop is the ego, because ego is the only barrier between you and existence, between you and bliss, between you and love, between you and god. Except for ego nothing is preventing you from living your life at the peak, at the optimum. Ego is your enemy, the only enemy; hence sannyas means surrender of the ego.\nAnd it is only a question of a little understanding that the ego never gives you anything except misery, except wounds, so why carry it? It has never given anybody anything. It is like a cancer of the soul. And remember, it is an\nincurable as the cancer of the body. Sooner or later they will find some cure for the bodily cancer but for ten thousand years mystics have tried to find a cure, but there is no cure, for ego; every cure becomes a nourishment for it.\nHence the decision of all the awakened ones is: why bother curing it? -- drop it, it can be dropped. That is a surgical method. There is no need for any medicine, simply drop it You cannot so simply drop the physical cancer, for the simple reason that it becomes part of your body. But the ego is never part of your soul; it only pretends to be. It never becomes the part, it always remains separate.\nThe moment you decide to drop it you can drop it immediately; you need not even wait for a single second. Hence many people have attained enlightenment instantly.\nA king came to see Buddha. He was bringing the greatest diamond that existed in those days to present to him. One should not go to a Buddha empty-handed, something has to be presented -- that was his idea.\nBut his queen said 'I know the Buddha, I have been to see him -- this diamond is nothing but a stone as far as he is concerned. Rather, take something better.' She said 'A lotus has blossomed in our pond, and it is unseasonal, rare, so take this lotus.'\nThe king; decided to take both. He thought 'First I will present the diamond -- if he accepts it, good; if he does not accept it, I will present the lotus.'\nHe presented the diamond and Buddha simply laughed and he said 'Drop it!' When Buddha said 'Drop it,' he had to drop it! He dropped it reluctantly because it was such a precious thing, but what can you do when ten thousand sannyasins are sitting there and in front of them Buddha says 'Drop it.' And when you have come to present it... So it was okay; he felt very sad but he dropped it.\nThen he presented the lotus flower and Buddha said 'Drop it.' Now he was feeling a little bit awkward.\nHe dropped that too and then he stood there with empty hands, a little bit embarrassed; 'Now what to do?\nHow to start a conversation with this man? And Buddha again said 'Drop it!' Then the king said 'Either you are crazy or I am crazy -- now my hands are\nempty.'\nAnd Mahakashyapa, one of Buddha's first disciples to become enlightened, said 'Drop it; drop it, don't 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nhesitate!' The king turned to Mahakashyapa and said 'But what should I drop? My hands are empty.' And Mahakashyapa said 'Now is the point of dropping. Buddha never meant that you should drop the diamond, he never meant that you should drop the flower. He means drop the ego, drop yourself. If you have come here then the only way to be in communion with Buddha is to drop the ego.'\nAnd the story is that the man fell at Buddha's feet and immediately became enlightened. It was a sudden enlightenment, just a simple understanding, and he dropped the ego. It can be dropped just like that.\nThat is the meaning of your name, let it become the meaning of your life too. Premdo means the loving one.\nThere are a few words which I emphasize continuously -- love is one of those words. It contains a whole philosophy of life. If you become loving nothing else is needed, because love goes on changing you. The deeper you love, the deeper you understand yourself. When you love totally you understand yourself totally.\nLove becomes a mirror in which you can see your original face.\nSo don't miss a single opportunity to love: love people, love animals, love trees, rocks, rivers, stars.\nDon't miss a single opportunity, and whatsoever you are doing do it lovingly. And start the journey from yourself: the first love is to love oneself.\nFor centuries we have been told the opposite; it has been engrained in us that it is bad to love oneself --\nlove others, of course, but don't love yourself. Now that is sheer stupidity. If a person is incapable of loving himself he cannot love anybody else in the world. Love begins at home, just as everything else begins at home.\nLove yourself, then go on radiating love. Radiate it to the whole universe. The farther the reach of your love, the bigger your consciousness. Love functions like wings and you start soaring higher and higher.\nLove can take you to the ultimate abode of god.\nIt is because of this that Jesus has made them synonymous: he says god is love. Devika means the divine.\nAll is divine, because except for god nothing else exists. Existence means god. When we say god is, we are unnecessarily repeating the same word because god means 'is', 'isness'. When we say god is existence we are repeating the same thing twice because god is 'isness', obviously god is existence, so everything is divine.\nThe earth is divine, the trees are divine, the stars are divine, the people are divine, even the devil is divine. The word 'devil' comes from the same root as divine. Devika also comes from the same Sanskrit root. Maybe the devil is divine but he is standing on his head -- that may be the only difference. He has just gone a little bit crazy, cuckoo, but even if he is a cuckoo god he is a god! (laughter) Nothing else exists, so the whole existence becomes a temple, and the whole world becomes a play to pray in, to worship in. Then wherever you are walking you are walking on holy 'round' whatsoever you are doing is sacred.\nBut the religions have created a division. They say when you go to the church it is religious and when you go to the shop or the office or the factory, that is worldly. When you are praying it is holy and when you are taking a shower it is nothing holy. I don't believe in this division. This division creates a split humanity, it is the root cause of schizophrenia.\nOne can take a shower as prayerfully as one can pray; one just has to be understanding. The water is divine, the shower is divine, the coolness is divine, you are divine. The divine is showering on the divine --\nit is multiplied!

Chuang Tzu Auditorium</h3><p>Archive code: 8012045 ShortTitle: GREENR04 Audio:</p><p>No Video:</p><p>No</p><p>[NOTE: This is an unedited tape transcript of an unpublished darshan
diary, which has been scanned and cleaned up. It is for reference
purposes only.]</p><p>Dhyan Helen: Dhyan means meditation. Helen means light.</p><p>Man without meditation is without light. He is just darkness. If one
looks within without knowing the art of meditation one will find only
darkness and darkness and nothing else. That's why nobody wants to look
within. The Christs, the Buddhas, the Zarathustras, have been telling
people to look within; Jesus goes on insisting that the kingdom of god
is within you and Socrates says know thyself. People listen but nobody
tries it because when they try the experience is not ecstatic, it is
just terrible! (laughter) There is nothing but emptiness, darkness. One
meets nobody -- no god, no kingdom of god. One goes with great
expectations and just the opposite is the case.</p><p>So one pays polite, formal respect to these great teachers and goes
on looking outside; the real world is there. But the reason why we miss
is that to look inside one needs a certain discipline. It is like
listening; to classical music: it needs a certain discipline, you need
certain ears to listen to it, to understand it, to feel it, to see the
beauty of it.</p><p>Meditation is a whole art; it is the art of focussing inwards, it is
the art of dropping the outside completely as if it has disappeared for
the moment at least,</p><p>it is illusory. When your total energy starts moving inside --
remember the word 'total' -- only then will you find light. And once you
have found light within you have found god and the kingdom of god. That
light transforms your whole life. It gives a new dance, a new song, to
your being.</p><p>Dhyan Paul. Dhyan means meditation. Paul means rest. Meditation is a
way of resting within yourself.</p><p>Mind is restlessness. Unless you go beyond the mind you cannot rest,
hence meditation means transcending mind, transcending restlessness,
being at ease, at home, utterly restful, as if there is nothing to do,
nowhere to go, so blissfully in the moment -- that is with no past, no
future, no thought, no memory, no desire, with not even a small ripple
in your consciousness to go somewhere else.</p><p>The mind is always running, chasing shadows, mirages, far-away goals.
It is ambitious, it is political; mind is a politician. To be in the
mind is to be in continuous struggle, competition -- how can you rest?
You can rest only when you understand the futility of ambition, the
futility of desire, the futility of <em>all</em> goals, then suddenly
your energy settles and rests at the very centre of your being. The
circumference starts shrinking and becomes equal to the centre; there is
no circumference, only the centre.</p><p>When you are in the mind there is no control only the circumference,
and the circumference goes on expanding. In meditation there is only the
centre, no circumference -- and that is the moment of rest. And to know
it is to know all, because by knowing it the door of the divine opens.
It is a beautiful name -- it carries the whole secret of meditation.</p><p>Anandi means blissful, cheerful, with laughter in the heart.</p><p>The religious people are ordinarily serious people. They have long
faces, sad, sombre, because they are engaged in something very great,
something divine, very superior to all the other activities people are
involved in. The whole world is mundane and they are holy -- how can a
holy person laugh? Impossible.</p><p>Laughter seems to be the very essence of unholiness.</p><p>Christians say, Jesus never laughed. Now there cannot be anything
more false than that. If one asks me I will say he never stopped
laughing, even on the cross he laughed. The last thing that he did was
to laugh, to 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished>Osho's books on

beautifully! Thousands of people were waiting for the miracle and
nothing happened! Can you find a better joke? Even he himself was
waiting and looking again and again... and nothing happened!</p><p>If something had happened the whole point would have been lost, the
punch line would have been missed! It was really beautiful of god not to
interfere. For the whole of his life Jesus was doing miracles --</p><p>raising the dead, giving eyes to the blind -- and at the last moment
he could not manage anything! He must have laughed! And when they all
met afterwards Jesus must have said, "You did it!"</p><p>I can't see why he should not laugh at the last moment. But
Christians go on saying he never laughed.</p><p>The statues they have made, the pictures, the paintings, are always
serious. Those are not representative, they are false, they are
inventions.</p><p>To me cheerfulness is the essence of religiousness. To take life as
fun, to enjoy it, to love it and to accept it with all its thorns and
flowers, with all its dark nights and beautiful days, to accept it in
its totality is sannyas.</p><p>Yes, there is agony; it needs to be there, it balances ecstasy.
Ecstasy alone will lose its taste. If one is ecstatic and never comes to
know what agony is, one will start forgetting what ecstasy is. The
ecstasy can be felt only when there is a background of agony. You can
see the stars in the night only when there is darkness as a backdrop. In
the day also they are there but the background is missing. It is so full
of light that they disappear.</p><p>Once you understand life with its duality then even in pain, even in
anguish, one has a cheerful heart because one understands; one
understands the essentiality of the polar opposite. Then in success or
failure one remains balanced, one's cheerfulness is not disturbed by
anything.</p><p>When Alexander came to India he wanted one sannyasin to go with him
-- his name was Dandamis --</p><p>but the sannyasin refused. He said 'Nobody can force me'... because
the way Alexander asked him to go was aggressive. He said 'either you
come with me or I will kill you!' Dandamis said 'It is better you kill
me, be finished with it -- I am not coming. Nobody can force me to do
anything and death has no point as far as I am concerned; I died long
ago.' And then he said 'Why are you waiting? Pull out your sword and cut
off my head. You will see it falling on the ground and I will also see
it. And you will hear my laughter. After my head has fallen you will
hear my laughter!'</p><p>Alexander could not kill him. For the first time he had come across a
man who was simply amazing, what he was saying. And he said 'I am sorry.
I should not have said it to you in such an aggressive way, this is just
my habit because everybody has always followed my orders. But now I
understand, there are people who cannot be forced. But can you please
send some of your disciples with me?'</p><p>Dandamis said 'That's alright.' He called a disciple, his name was
Kalyan, Kalyan Swami was his name.</p><p>He said 'Kalyan, you go with this fool.' Kalyan said 'Okay, master.
Anyway I have to go.' Alexander could not understand what this talk was
all about -- Kalyan had said 'Anyway I have to go.' Only later on did he
understand, because on the way Kalyan Swami died. When he died he said
'Now do you understand? Do you understand or not? I told my master
"Anyway I have to go, so it doesn't matter.' He has sent a dead man with
you! (laughter) He befooled you!'</p><p>Alexander said 'But you Hindus believe in the immortality of the soul
-- don't you think you will not die?' He said 'No, I will not die, and I
will see you in Babylon and he died without explaining what he meant by
'I will see you in Babylon.' Alexander understood it only because he
died in Babylon; when he was moving back to his home, on the way, in
Babylon, he died. One of his advisers reminded him: 'That man was right!
He said "I will see you in Babylon."'</p><p>These people are cheerful people. Now Dandamis played a trick on
Alexander -- sending a disciple who was already going to die within a
few months. Then the</p><p>disciple played a trick on him; he said 'I will see you in Babylon.'
He was just laughing about death -- it is nothing much to be serious
about. Even death is not worth being serious about. But there are fools
who think that even life is a serious affair; nothing is a serious
affair.</p><p>My sannyasins have to learn to be cheerful in every situation -- good
or bad. Even if you are thrown into hell, go laughing and your laughter
will transform hell. This is my fundamental message: I want a
religiousness in the world which knows how to laugh, how to be blissful,
how to dance, how to celebrate.</p><p>Gandharvo means divine musician. In Indian mythology gandharvas are
the musicians of god, they are heavenly musicians.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>Music is divine. It is something that comes very close to meditation.
Just one step more and you are in the world of meditation. Music is
almost the boundary line between mind and meditation. Nothing comes
closer because music is pure joy, it is festivity. Also it has no words.
Words are limited, sounds have unlimited significance.</p><p>And the beauty of music is that although it is sound it creates
silence. That is the criterion to judge whether Music is real music or
just pseudo. The pseudo means it is noisy; it simply disturbs you. Maybe
the disturbance looks like excitement, but it is not of any great value.
That's what the so-called pop music does: it touches only the
superficial in you, the biological, the sexual; it does not go deep. The
higher the music is, the more the sound starts doing a miracle: it
creates silence. When the music creates silence in you, when listening
to the sound silence is created, then one is truly a musician, then has
heard the real music.</p><p>Meditation can be expressed only through music. So learn the beauty
of the sound, so that you can learn the beauty of silence. From sound to
silence -- that is the way of the meditator. Just listen to this silence
of the night. It is also sound,</p><p>the insects <em>are</em> creating a certain king of music but their
sound does not disturb the silence; on the contrary, it enhances it, it
enriches it. And life should be such that the paradoxical, the
contradictory, becomes complimentary. Then your very life has a music, a
harmony, and only in that harmony does one come to know the truth.</p><p>Shantiprem. Shanti means silence, prem means love. The moment these
both happen together you have entered the world of miracles.</p><p>Love is excitement, it is feverish -- that's why it is called
passion. It is a little bit crazy, it drives you nuts! (laughter) Love
alone is not enough. Silence is also needed to balance it, to give it
some sanity, to make it less of a fever and more of a healthy
phenomenon.</p><p>Silence alone is dead. It is of a graveyard, it is not alive. Love is
needed, then even on the grave roses start blooming. Love and silence
together make a life a really rich life.</p><p>And that's the work my sannyasins have to do, to create a rich life.
I am against poverty -- and the greatest poverty is of the inner, the
outer poverty will be removed sooner or later. Either science will
remove it or nature will remove it, but it is going to be removed, it
cannot remain for long. But the inner poverty, neither science can
remove nor nature can remove. It has to be removed by the individual.
Hence I have chosen the inner world and the work that is concerned with
that.</p><p>The outer world is the concern of the politicians, the social
workers, the so- called revolutionaries, scientists, technicians -- that
is their work. My work is to change the inner world and to make it rich
-- and richness happens only when love and silence meet. When love and
silence are really merged into one organic unity you have come to know
the greatest joy of life.</p><p>Vishram means relaxation.</p><p>Life should be lived in a very relaxed way. There is no need to be in
a hurry, there is no need to be always rushing. It is to no purpose at
all, nothing is served by it. In fact it is a way of destroying your
life, because once this rushing becomes your habit you are never where
you are, you are always somewhere else, so your body is in one place,
your mind is in some other place. And this distance between your body
and mind creates anxiety, anguish, and never allows</p><p>you joy. Joy means to be here and now, so totally that there is no
idea at all of being anywhere else or of being somebody else.</p><p>To feel relaxation is to feel the mystery of your being, because then
you are available, unoccupied, utterly open and vulnerable. In a relaxed
state you open up like a lotus flower -- to the sun, to the rain, to the
wind, to all that is. And this whole is divine. God is not a person but
only the totality of existence, the organic unity of all that is. But
you can know it only when you are not in a rush, not in a hurry.</p><p>Sannyasins have to learn to relax, to drop this speedy neurosis. It
is neurosis, it is driving people almost insane. Now psychologists say
that out of four persons three are almost insane. And when out of four,
three are insane, how long can the fourth remain sane? -- because he
will have to live with the three! And the greatest insanity comes to
people who have to live with insane people. The fourth cannot remain
sane for long; he has to become part of the insanity, otherwise he
cannot survive.</p><p>I teach my sannyasins to be relaxed, because through relaxation
sanity comes, awareness comes, peace comes, bliss comes, love comes and
ultimately, the ultimate guest too: God comes!</p><p>Kavya means poetry.</p><p>My approach towards life is not that of a philosopher but that of a
poet. Philosophy is something of the 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>mind -- rational, logical, but superficial. Poetry is of the heart --
it is not thinking, it is feelings it is not logic, it is love. And when
you love life, when you feel life without the interference of the mind,
you are in immediate contact with god.</p><p>The first step is to change your gears from the head to the heart,
from being a philosopher... And everybody is a philosopher; a few people
are &amp;cod</p><p>philosophers and a few people are bad philosophers --</p><p>that doesn't matter. A few people are very systematic philosophers
and others are lousy, but <em>all</em> are philosophers, more or less,
in some way or other; hence the first shift has to be from the head to
the heart.</p><p>The poet stands between the philosopher and the mystic, the heart is
exactly in between the head and the being so the heart is a necessary
station, anyone who is going on the journey of being -- and that's what
sannyas is all about -- first has to stop at the heart.</p><p>Once you have settled at the heart and mind is no more a disturbance,
the second step is not difficult, very easy; then one starts moving from
feeling to being. And once you have reached being sannyas is
fulfilled.</p><p>The philosopher is the farthest from the truth; the poet is very
close, the mystic has arrived -- he has found his home. But nobody can
go bypassing the heart.</p><p>So start feeling more, thinking less, start loving more, dropping
logic, calculation, arithmetic. This is half of the work, and the most
hard part; the second part is very easy. If one has done the first part,
the second happens very easily, very spontaneously. In fact nothing is
needed to be done for the second; once you have started feeling you are
bound to go through a new transformation.</p><p>The feeling slowly slowly disappears of its own accord and only being
is left. When only you are, simply you are -- no thought, no feeling,
just a pure existence -- then you are a mirror, and in that mirror
reality is reflected as it is.</p><p>Vinamro means humble, simple, with no desire to be somebody, utterly
at rest with being nobody.</p><p>A sannyasin is a nobody. The only thing that he has to drop is the
ego, because ego is the only barrier between you and existence, between
you and bliss, between you and love, between you and god. Except for ego
nothing is preventing you from living your life at the peak, at the
optimum. Ego is your enemy, the only enemy; hence sannyas means
surrender of the ego.</p><p>And it is only a question of a little understanding that the ego
never gives you anything except misery, except wounds, so why carry it?
It has never given anybody anything. It is like a cancer of the soul.
And remember, it is an</p><p>incurable as the cancer of the body. Sooner or later they will find
some cure for the bodily cancer but for ten thousand years mystics have
tried to find a cure, but there is no cure, for ego; every cure becomes
a nourishment for it.</p><p>Hence the decision of all the awakened ones is: why bother curing it?
-- drop it, it can be dropped. That is a surgical method. There is no
need for any medicine, simply drop it You cannot so simply drop the
physical cancer, for the simple reason that it becomes part of your
body. But the ego is never part of your soul; it only pretends to be. It
never becomes the part, it always remains separate.</p><p>The moment you decide to drop it you can drop it immediately; you
need not even wait for a single second. Hence many people have attained
enlightenment instantly.</p><p>A king came to see Buddha. He was bringing the greatest diamond that
existed in those days to present to him. One should not go to a Buddha
empty-handed, something has to be presented -- that was his idea.</p><p>But his queen said 'I know the Buddha, I have been to see him -- this
diamond is nothing but a stone as far as he is concerned. Rather, take
something better.' She said 'A lotus has blossomed in our pond, and it
is unseasonal, rare, so take this lotus.'</p><p>The king; decided to take both. He thought 'First I will present the
diamond -- if he accepts it, good; if he does not accept it, I will
present the lotus.'</p><p>He presented the diamond and Buddha simply laughed and he said 'Drop
it!' When Buddha said 'Drop it,' he had to drop it! He dropped it
reluctantly because it was such a precious thing, but what can you do
when ten thousand sannyasins are sitting there and in front of them
Buddha says 'Drop it.' And when you have come to present it... So it was
okay; he felt very sad but he dropped it.</p><p>Then he presented the lotus flower and Buddha said 'Drop it.' Now he
was feeling a little bit awkward.</p><p>He dropped that too and then he stood there with empty hands, a
little bit embarrassed; 'Now what to do?</p><p>How to start a conversation with this man? And Buddha again said
'Drop it!' Then the king said 'Either you are crazy or I am crazy -- now
my hands are</p><p>empty.'</p><p>And Mahakashyapa, one of Buddha's first disciples to become
enlightened, said 'Drop it; drop it, don't 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>hesitate!' The king turned to Mahakashyapa and said 'But what should
I drop? My hands are empty.' And Mahakashyapa said 'Now is the point of
dropping. Buddha never meant that you should drop the diamond, he never
meant that you should drop the flower. He means drop the ego, drop
yourself. If you have come here then the only way to be in communion
with Buddha is to drop the ego.'</p><p>And the story is that the man fell at Buddha's feet and immediately
became enlightened. It was a sudden enlightenment, just a simple
understanding, and he dropped the ego. It can be dropped just like
that.</p><p>That is the meaning of your name, let it become the meaning of your
life too. Premdo means the loving one.</p><p>There are a few words which I emphasize continuously -- love is one
of those words. It contains a whole philosophy of life. If you become
loving nothing else is needed, because love goes on changing you. The
deeper you love, the deeper you understand yourself. When you love
totally you understand yourself totally.</p><p>Love becomes a mirror in which you can see your original face.</p><p>So don't miss a single opportunity to love: love people, love
animals, love trees, rocks, rivers, stars.</p><p>Don't miss a single opportunity, and whatsoever you are doing do it
lovingly. And start the journey from yourself: the first love is to love
oneself.</p><p>For centuries we have been told the opposite; it has been engrained
in us that it is bad to love oneself --</p><p>love others, of course, but don't love yourself. Now that is sheer
stupidity. If a person is incapable of loving himself he cannot love
anybody else in the world. Love begins at home, just as everything else
begins at home.</p><p>Love yourself, then go on radiating love. Radiate it to the whole
universe. The farther the reach of your love, the bigger your
consciousness. Love functions like wings and you start soaring higher
and higher.</p><p>Love can take you to the ultimate abode of god.</p><p>It is because of this that Jesus has made them synonymous: he says
god is love. Devika means the divine.</p><p>All is divine, because except for god nothing else exists. Existence
means god. When we say god is, we are unnecessarily repeating the same
word because god means 'is', 'isness'. When we say god is existence we
are repeating the same thing twice because god is 'isness', obviously
god is existence, so everything is divine.</p><p>The earth is divine, the trees are divine, the stars are divine, the
people are divine, even the devil is divine. The word 'devil' comes from
the same root as divine. Devika also comes from the same Sanskrit root.
Maybe the devil is divine but he is standing on his head -- that may be
the only difference. He has just gone a little bit crazy, cuckoo, but
even if he is a cuckoo god he is a god! (laughter) Nothing else exists,
so the whole existence becomes a temple, and the whole world becomes a
play to pray in, to worship in. Then wherever you are walking you are
walking on holy 'round' whatsoever you are doing is sacred.</p><p>But the religions have created a division. They say when you go to
the church it is religious and when you go to the shop or the office or
the factory, that is worldly. When you are praying it is holy and when
you are taking a shower it is nothing holy. I don't believe in this
division. This division creates a split humanity, it is the root cause
of schizophrenia.</p><p>One can take a shower as prayerfully as one can pray; one just has to
be understanding. The water is divine, the shower is divine, the
coolness is divine, <em>you</em> are divine. The divine is showering on
the divine --</p><p>it is multiplied! It is just a question of seeing, understanding; and
only then a</p><p>person is religious -- when all his acts, gestures, movements become
divine. Then the twenty-four hours of your day are prayerful.</p><p>That's the meaning of sannyas, to transform your whole life into a
prayer, an unending prayer.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=is-the-grass-really-greener...>Is the Grass Really Greener...?</h3><p>Chapter #5 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-4>Osho's books on

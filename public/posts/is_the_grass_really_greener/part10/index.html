It is for reference purposes only.]\nSurajprakash Bharti.\nOnly one thing to be remembered, my sannyas has two aspects to it -- one is non-renunciation of life, because life is god. To renounce it is irreligious, it is against existence.\nOne has to worship life, to live it totally, prayerfully of course, because it is divine. Hence there is no need to escape anywhere; and the escapist is not going to find god. He has been the cause of the whole misery of humanity. escapism is cowardliness but we have worshipped escapism for thousands of years.\nThat has taken away the most beautiful people from the A world, the people who would have benefitted, the people who would have made it a paradise. I am totally against that. My sannyasins have to love life, to live life, to rejoice in it.\nAnd the second aspect of my sannyas is to be meditative. Be in life but very quiet, calm, silent. Life becomes the circumference and meditation becomes the centre. A sannyasin has to be a centre of the cyclone. Without the cyclone the centre is dead, without the centre the cyclone is mad. And the meeting of 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nboth is what yoga really is; the meeting of the turmoil with the silent consciousness. At that meeting point god happens.\nDhyan Dante. Dante is really a significant name; it means the feminine. And all that is beautiful is feminine, all that is significant is feminine. It is the male mind that has destroyed the beauty of life. The male mind is aggressive, it is violent, it is destructive. Creativity belongs to the feminine mind, hence I appreciate the feminine. I would like the world to be more feminine than it has ever been.\nIn three thousand years five thousand wars have been fought -- this is what the male mind has done. I am in support of a matriarchal system. I would like the power to go to women because basically they are non -- aggressive; they are loving, they are compassionate. But it has nothing to do with biology really; even the male mind can become feminine. And the whole process of transforming the male mind is the art of meditation.\nThat is the meaning of Dhyan.\nSo your full name means the creation of the feminine quality through meditation. Respect the feminine\n-- it is higher, certainly higher, than the male qualities. But the male chauvinist mind is incapable of accepting it. Out of an inferiority complex the male mind has tried to repress the feminine and of course because the male is aggressive, violent, destructive, he can repress it. The feminine is receptive, surrendering; it knows how to let go, it knows how to adjust, so it has become adjusted even to the male chauvinist attitude.\nThe whole past of humanity is ugly and the reason is that we have not allowed the feminine qualities to blossom.\nSo become more and more receptive, sensitive, creative, loving, dancing, singing\n-- and that's how you will go on becoming more and more meditative. And the more meditative you are, the more you will find feminine qualities blossoming\nin you. The moment the male energy becomes feminine a Buddha is born, a Christ is born.\nShanti Ann. Shanti means silence. Ann means prayer.\nThe ordinary idea of prayer is to say something to god -- which is absolutely foolish. There is nothing to say; one can only be silent before god. To say anything is to create a disturbance, to say anything is to bring your head in. And prayer is a heart-to-heart communion, it is not a communication.\nSo all the prayers which exist on the earth are pseudo -- Christian, Hindu, Mohammedan, whatsoever they are, wherever they are. The temples, the mosques, the synagogues, the churches -- they are all involved in a pseudo kind of religion, because they all teach prayer as a dialogue.\nI teach prayer as silence, not as dialogue. It is not a dialogue. We have nothing to say, rather, on the contrary, we have to listen. Listening to existence is prayer, and listening can happen only in deep silence.\nAnd the beauty of silence is that it is neither Hindu nor Mohammedan nor Christian nor Jewish, it is simply silence. So the silent person goes beyond ail sects, cults and ideologies. And only the silent person is capable of knowing something of god.\nDhyan Itzik. Dhyan means meditation.\nMeditation is a state of absolute silence where mind stops functioning. When the mind is no more present your mirror of consciousness is utterly empty -- no thoughts, no desires, no memories. The lake of consciousness is absolutely without waves, even without ripples.\nAnd Itzik is tremendously significant; it means laughter.\nThe idea has gone very deep in the human mind that religious people have to be serious and sad, with long faces. Laughter seems to be too mundane. It is not so. Laughter is one of the most sacred phenomenon on the earth. In fact in profound laughter mind disappears exactly like it disappears in meditation. That's why laughter is so relaxing, so rejuvenating. A good laugh is a tonic, it is very vital for one's well-being.\nThe man who cannot laugh is ill, sick. A heartfelt laughter releases your hidden sources of energy. One thing is certain, when you are in real laughter, when it is not just polite, when it is not just polite, when it is not just to say that yes, you understand the humour of the situation or the meaning of the joke, when it is really arising out of your heart, when it is total, whole, when your whole being is throbbing with it, then it gives you a taste of meditation.\nMind disappears; it cannot exist in laughter. It melts, it evaporates, for a moment there is no mind, there is only laughter. There is no one who is laughing, there is pure laughter. And that's exactly what meditation 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nis. When the dancer disappears and there is only dance it is meditation, when the singer disappears and there is only singing it is meditation, when the lover disappears and there is only loving it is meditation, when the walker disappears and is only walking it is meditation. And laughter gives you the taste of meditation more easily than anything else.\nSo I teach a new kind of sannyas. It is non-serious -- sincere but not serious. It knows how to laugh and enjoy, it takes life as fun. It does not think of life as mundane, hence it has no egoistic idea of holier-than-thou.\nI teach a dancing, singing, laughing, loving sannyas. It is urgently needed. We are tired of the sad saints\n-- enough of all that junk! We should get rid of all those long faces. The temples will become alive again when people start dancing, singing, laughing, loving. When all these ordinary life activities start having this sacred dimension, only then can the earth be transformed into heaven, not before it.\nAnd this earth is so beautiful -- it can become a paradise. All that is needed is a new kind of man. That's what my sannyas is: the beginning of a new kind of man.\nJayesh means the victorious.\nThere is only one victory, that is victory over oneself. The people who are trying to be victorious over others are simply deceiving themselves; sooner or later they will find they have wasted their life in something utterly futile. Death will come\n-- it is coming, every moment it is coming closer -- and it will take all your trophies and medals and degrees and honours and prizes. All your victories will be gone with it and you will be left alone, utterly defeated, empty.\nBefore it happens it is better to reconsider your life. The initiation into sannyas means a reconsideration of your lifestyle. One has to be very clear what is essential and what is non-essential.\nThe outside activities are non-essential; yes, they have to be done so they should be done, but one should not stake one's whole life on them -- on money, power, prestige. One should think more of the inner dimension -- the real kingdom of god is there and we have to conquer it. And it can be easily conquered because it is already inside us; we just have to discover it. The very discovery becomes the victory.\nSujato means well-born.\nThe first birth is only physical; it can only be called a so-called birth. It gives you the opportunity for a second birth, it is meaningful only in reference to the second birth. The second birth happens through meditation. When you become aware of yourself, when you become immensely contented with your consciousness, when you suddenly explore the eternity of your being, then you become really well-born.\nThe first birth will end with the death; the second birth will not end with death. The second birth will make you part of the eternal process of life. Then there is no beginning and no end, then it is a continuity.\nAnd when one is completely beyond death all fears disappear -- life becomes a blessing, a benediction.\nNavino means the new.\nWe are conditioned by the old, to live according to the old, to live for the old, to sacrifice ourselves for the old. That means we are dominated by the grave-yard. That our whole life is continuously pulled backwards. This is not the true way to live; it may be a good way to commit slow suicide but it is not a way to live.\nTo live authentically one has to go on dying to the past every moment, so every moment one is new and fresh, as fresh as the dewdrops in the early morning sun, as fresh as a lotus just opening in the lake. Each moment should be fresh, young, alive, innocent, unburdened by the past. Then life brings so many surprises, so many wonders, so many gifts, that there is no way to repay it. Only tears of gratitude, only a heart throbbing with thankfulness -- that's all we can give... and that's what prayer is. Only the person who is not burdened by the past can be prayerful.\nPrayer means a deep gratitude towards existence, but you can feel the gratitude only when you have enjoyed existence. People are dragging, they are not dancing, and they are carrying a mountainous burden, the Himalayas. And they cling to their burden; they are dying under the burden but they think it is very precious. They think all that is old is gold. That is sheer nonsense. Only the new is divine.\nAnd each moment one has to discover it. One should not lag behind, there should not be a gap between oneself and the moment. The bigger the gap, the bigger the misery, the lesser the gap, the lesser the misery.\nIf there is no gap then there is no misery, no suffering; then the whole of life is nothing but a sheer joy.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nPradipo means a lamp, a light.\nWe in India make small earthen lamps. Those earthen lamps are called 'pradip'. A pradip is just a small bowl made of earth; it represents the human being.\nOur body is made of earth, that's why man is called Adam; Adam means earth. The body is made of earth but inside the body there is a flame which is not part of the earth, which belongs to god, to the beyond.\nSo looking at an earthen lamp you have the whole representation of humanity: the earth is represented and the flame represents consciousness.\nThe flame is continuously going upwards. To go upwards is natural for the flame, for the flame gravitation does not exist. It follows another law. In the East we have called it the law of levitation; science has yet to discover it. They have found gravitation and they know that each law has to be counterbalanced by another law on the opposite pole. If there is a law which pulls things downwards there must be a law that pulls things upwards, only then can there be a balance.\nSo the body is pulled downwards and your consciousness is pulled upwards. Take care of the body but don't forget the flame -- that's all I expect from my sannyasins.\nThe body is a beautiful place because it is enshrining in itself the beyond -- but remember the beyond because in fact that flame is our real being. The body is only a host, remember the guest! It has been staying in many bodies in the past; this is only one of the caravanserais. And when you stay in a caravanserai you know that in the morning you have to go.\nSo don't forget the journey, the ultimate journey. Remembering it transforms the quality of your whole life. And meditation helps you to discover the flame.\nIt is unfortunate that millions of people live only as the earth and they never come to know their inner heaven. My effort here is to help you to discover it. It is already the case, nothing has to be done -- just a little digging is needed. And it is a simple process, just like digging a well in the earth; and soon you will find the water. Maybe a few rocks have to be removed or sometimes maybe dynamite has to be used (laughter). For that I have found the dynamic meditation -- that is the dynamite!\nNavajata means newly born. Sannyas is a birth.\nSocrates says that the master is a midwife -- and he is right. The master simply helps you to come out of a certain womb.\nThe first birth is the coming out of the womb of the mother. The mother's womb is a physiological thing, but then one lives in a psychological womb and the\nmaster can bring you out of your psychological womb.\nThe moment you are out of your psychological womb, for the first time you know that you are not the mind, you are something transcendental to both body and mind. And to know it is to know all. Knowing it makes one feel utterly contented, absolutely contented. One has come home, one has found the goal; all desires are fulfilled, the deepest longing of the heart is satisfied. And the moment there is no desire, no longing, that is the moment when bliss happens, or one can say nirvana happens or god happens. These are different words to say the same thing.\nUnless one comes out of the mind one remains in a cocoon -- closed to the wind, to the rain, to the sun, to the stars, to the infinity of existence and to all its joys and all its gifts; and they are immense, incalculable.\nTo remain confined to one's own mind is to live in a grave. To come out of it is to allow the hidden splendour to be released. And with it comes thousands of flowers -- love, freedom, light, silence.\n-- How long will you be here?\n-- Till the baby is born.\n(One's eyes instinctively fall on Navajata's body. Perhaps she is physically pregnant too; whatever the case, Osho chuckles in response.)\n-- That's good. I am your midwife! (laughter) Mandir means a temple.\nMan is a temple but from the outside you can only see the walls. It is very strange that not only do people see you from the outside, you also see yourself from the outside. You look in the mirror to find your face, you look into people's eyes to find your image, you listen to people's opinions to know who you are --\ngood, bad, moral, immoral, saint, sinner. This is really strange, because we can know ourselves from within; there is no need for any mirror, there is no need to depend on other's opinions, because their opinions will 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nonly tell us about the walls, the outer walls of our temples. They cannot tell us anything about the deity within.\nAnd sannyas is nothing but the change, the shift, the radical shift, from looking at oneself from outside to looking at oneself from inside. It is sitting inside and looking, not depending on other's opinions, scriptures, etcetera, but just watching yourself from your innermost core and asking 'Who am I?', not depending on anybody else's answer. One has to find one's own answer, only that can be fulfilling. And the moment you sit at the centre of your being and you watch, you are amazed your body is only a temple, god is inside you. And there is no way to find it from outside, there is no need to find it from the outside.\nOnce you have discovered your god within yourself then you will be able to see it in other people also, the same; you will know they are also temples and that god is bound to be there because they are alive and life is god.\nTo me life and god are synonymous, interchangeable. And if I have to choose between the two words I would like to choose the word 'life' instead of 'god', because 'god' has been exploited by the priests for so long that they have made the word almost dirty, obscene. It is better to use the word 'life' and not even with a capital 'L', but with a lower case 'l'. Just the simple life, the ordinary life, is divine.\nThe moment you can see your god within, your life within, your truth within, you will find it everywhere too. Then you will see it in the trees, in the people, in the animals, everywhere you will see it.\nWherever life is, god is. Then the whole existence becomes his temple and then there is no need to go to the Hindu temple or the Christian temple or the Jewish temple -- that looks childish.\nDhyan Madira.\nI am giving you a very paradoxical name for the simple reason that life is paradoxical, existence is a paradox, hence it cannot be understood by logic, because a paradox is beyond logic. To logic it looks absurd. It can be understood\nonly by a very loving heart, not by a logical mind. One has to change the gestalt from logic to love.\nYour name means meditative drunkenness. Meditation means awareness; and this is my observation, that as you become more meditative, both things grow together in you. It is illogical, but what can I do? --\nthat's how it is. On one hand you become more alert, more aware; on the other hand you become more drunk; and they go on growing simultaneously. That's the beauty of it, because if one is simply aware then it will be dry, without any juice. It will be arithmetical but there will be no poetry in it; it will be scientific but something will be missing in it. It will be objective but it will not have the inner dimension of subjectivity, of interiority. It will be measurable but that means it will be limited. It will not have the quality of indefinability. It will not have any music; it will have mathematics but no music.\nDrunkenness means poetry, music, dance. And if there is only drunkenness and no awareness then too something is missing; then you become unconscious, you go into a coma. They balance each other, they both nourish each other; they are opposite only for those who have not experienced the state. For those who have experienced it, they are complementary, not opposite. The drunkenness makes awareness green, alive, flowering, and awareness makes the drunkenness not dark, not unconscious, not falling into a coma; it keeps it above unconsciousness.\nSo there is a kind of dance in it, but that dance remains fully alert, conscious at the centre. And only when these two things happen together is one able to understand life in its totality; otherwise the approach is partial, and a partial approach is not going to give you fulfilment. Only the whole can fulfil you.\nFor me to be whole is to be holy. And this is the most beautiful whole!\nIs the Grass Really Greener...?

live life, to rejoice in it.</p><p>And the second aspect of my sannyas is to be meditative. Be in life
but very quiet, calm, silent. Life becomes the circumference and
meditation becomes the centre. A sannyasin has to be a centre of the
cyclone. Without the cyclone the centre is dead, without the centre the
cyclone is mad. And the meeting of 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished>Osho's books on

silent consciousness. At that meeting point god happens.</p><p>Dhyan Dante. Dante is really a significant name; it means the
feminine. And all that is beautiful is feminine, all that is significant
is feminine. It is the male mind that has destroyed the beauty of life.
The male mind is aggressive, it is violent, it is destructive.
Creativity belongs to the feminine mind, hence I appreciate the
feminine. I would like the world to be more feminine than it has ever
been.</p><p>In three thousand years five thousand wars have been fought -- this
is what the male mind has done. I am in support of a matriarchal system.
I would like the power to go to women because basically they are non --
aggressive; they are loving, they are compassionate. But it has nothing
to do with biology really; even the male mind can become feminine. And
the whole process of transforming the male mind is the art of
meditation.</p><p>That is the meaning of Dhyan.</p><p>So your full name means the creation of the feminine quality through
meditation. Respect the feminine</p><p>-- it is higher, certainly higher, than the male qualities. But the
male chauvinist mind is incapable of accepting it. Out of an inferiority
complex the male mind has tried to repress the feminine and of course
because the male is aggressive, violent, destructive, he can repress it.
The feminine is receptive, surrendering; it knows how to let go, it
knows how to adjust, so it has become adjusted even to the male
chauvinist attitude.</p><p>The whole past of humanity is ugly and the reason is that we have not
allowed the feminine qualities to blossom.</p><p>So become more and more receptive, sensitive, creative, loving,
dancing, singing</p><p>-- and that's how you will go on becoming more and more meditative.
And the more meditative you are, the more you will find feminine
qualities blossoming</p><p>in you. The moment the male energy becomes feminine a Buddha is born,
a Christ is born.</p><p>Shanti Ann. Shanti means silence. Ann means prayer.</p><p>The ordinary idea of prayer is to say something to god -- which is
absolutely foolish. There is nothing to say; one can only be silent
before god. To say anything is to create a disturbance, to say anything
is to bring your head in. And prayer is a heart-to-heart communion, it
is not a communication.</p><p>So all the prayers which exist on the earth are pseudo -- Christian,
Hindu, Mohammedan, whatsoever they are, wherever they are. The temples,
the mosques, the synagogues, the churches -- they are all involved in a
pseudo kind of religion, because they all teach prayer as a
dialogue.</p><p>I teach prayer as silence, not as dialogue. It is not a dialogue. We
have nothing to say, rather, on the contrary, we have to listen.
Listening to existence is prayer, and listening can happen only in deep
silence.</p><p>And the beauty of silence is that it is neither Hindu nor Mohammedan
nor Christian nor Jewish, it is simply silence. So the silent person
goes beyond ail sects, cults and ideologies. And only the silent person
is capable of knowing something of god.</p><p>Dhyan Itzik. Dhyan means meditation.</p><p>Meditation is a state of absolute silence where mind stops
functioning. When the mind is no more present your mirror of
consciousness is utterly empty -- no thoughts, no desires, no memories.
The lake of consciousness is absolutely without waves, even without
ripples.</p><p>And Itzik is tremendously significant; it means laughter.</p><p>The idea has gone very deep in the human mind that religious people
have to be serious and sad, with long faces. Laughter seems to be too
mundane. It is not so. Laughter is one of the most sacred phenomenon on
the earth. In fact in profound laughter mind disappears exactly like it
disappears in meditation. That's why laughter is so relaxing, so
rejuvenating. A good laugh is a tonic, it is very vital for one's
well-being.</p><p>The man who cannot laugh is ill, sick. A heartfelt laughter releases
your hidden sources of energy. One thing is certain, when you are in
real laughter, when it is not just polite, when it is not just polite,
when it is not just to say that yes, you understand the humour of the
situation or the meaning of the joke, when it is <em>really</em> arising
out of your heart, when it is total, whole, when your whole being is
throbbing with it, then it gives you a taste of meditation.</p><p>Mind disappears; it cannot exist in laughter. It melts, it
evaporates, for a moment there is no mind, there is only laughter. There
is no one who is laughing, there is pure laughter. And that's exactly
what meditation 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on

meditation, when the singer disappears and there is only singing it is
meditation, when the lover disappears and there is only loving it is
meditation, when the walker disappears and is only walking it is
meditation. And laughter gives you the taste of meditation more easily
than anything else.</p><p>So I teach a new kind of sannyas. It is non-serious -- sincere but
not serious. It knows how to laugh and enjoy, it takes life as fun. It
does not think of life as mundane, hence it has no egoistic idea of
holier-than-thou.</p><p>I teach a dancing, singing, laughing, loving sannyas. It is urgently
needed. We are tired of the sad saints</p><p>-- enough of all that junk! We should get rid of all those long
faces. The temples will become alive again when people start dancing,
singing, laughing, loving. When all these ordinary life activities start
having this sacred dimension, only then can the earth be transformed
into heaven, not before it.</p><p>And this earth is so beautiful -- it <em>can</em> become a paradise.
All that is needed is a new kind of man. That's what my sannyas is: the
beginning of a new kind of man.</p><p>Jayesh means the victorious.</p><p>There is only one victory, that is victory over oneself. The people
who are trying to be victorious over others are simply deceiving
themselves; sooner or later they will find they have wasted their life
in something utterly futile. Death will come</p><p>-- it <em>is</em> coming, every moment it is coming closer -- and it
will take all your trophies and medals and degrees and honours and
prizes. All your victories will be gone with it and you will be left
alone, utterly defeated, empty.</p><p>Before it happens it is better to reconsider your life. The
initiation into sannyas means a reconsideration of your lifestyle. One
has to be very clear what is essential and what is non-essential.</p><p>The outside activities are non-essential; yes, they have to be done
so they should be done, but one should not stake one's whole life on
them -- on money, power, prestige. One should think more of the inner
dimension -- the real kingdom of god is there and we have to conquer it.
And it can be easily conquered because it is already inside us; we just
have to discover it. The very discovery becomes the victory.</p><p>Sujato means well-born.</p><p>The first birth is only physical; it can only be called a so-called
birth. It gives you the opportunity for a second birth, it is meaningful
only in reference to the second birth. The second birth happens through
meditation. When you become aware of yourself, when you become immensely
contented with your consciousness, when you suddenly explore the
eternity of your being, then you become really well-born.</p><p>The first birth will end with the death; the second birth will not
end with death. The second birth will make you part of the eternal
process of life. Then there is no beginning and no end, then it is a
continuity.</p><p>And when one is completely beyond death all fears disappear -- life
becomes a blessing, a benediction.</p><p>Navino means the new.</p><p>We are conditioned by the old, to live according to the old, to live
for the old, to sacrifice ourselves for the old. That means we are
dominated by the grave-yard. That our whole life is continuously pulled
backwards. This is not the true way to live; it may be a good way to
commit slow suicide but it is not a way to live.</p><p>To live authentically one has to go on dying to the past every
moment, so every moment one is new and fresh, as fresh as the dewdrops
in the early morning sun, as fresh as a lotus just opening in the lake.
Each moment should be fresh, young, alive, innocent, unburdened by the
past. Then life brings so many surprises, so many wonders, so many
gifts, that there is no way to repay it. Only tears of gratitude, only a
heart throbbing with thankfulness -- that's all we can give... and
that's what prayer is. Only the person who is not burdened by the past
can be prayerful.</p><p>Prayer means a deep gratitude towards existence, but you can feel the
gratitude only when you have enjoyed existence. People are dragging,
they are not dancing, and they are carrying a mountainous burden, the
Himalayas. And they cling to their burden; they are dying under the
burden but they think it is very precious. They think all that is old is
gold. That is sheer nonsense. Only the new is divine.</p><p>And each moment one has to discover it. One should not lag behind,
there should not be a gap between oneself and the moment. The bigger the
gap, the bigger the misery, the lesser the gap, the lesser the
misery.</p><p>If there is no gap then there is no misery, no suffering; then the
whole of life is nothing but a sheer joy.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on

'pradip'. A pradip is just a small bowl made of earth; it represents the
human being.</p><p>Our body is made of earth, that's why man is called Adam; Adam means
earth. The body is made of earth but inside the body there is a flame
which is not part of the earth, which belongs to god, to the beyond.</p><p>So looking at an earthen lamp you have the whole representation of
humanity: the earth is represented and the flame represents
consciousness.</p><p>The flame is continuously going upwards. To go upwards is natural for
the flame, for the flame gravitation does not exist. It follows another
law. In the East we have called it the law of levitation; science has
yet to discover it. They have found gravitation and they know that each
law has to be counterbalanced by another law on the opposite pole. If
there is a law which pulls things downwards there must be a law that
pulls things upwards, only then can there be a balance.</p><p>So the body is pulled downwards and your consciousness is pulled
upwards. Take care of the body but don't forget the flame -- that's all
I expect from my sannyasins.</p><p>The body is a beautiful place because it is enshrining in itself the
beyond -- but remember the beyond because in fact that flame is our real
being. The body is only a host, remember the guest! It has been staying
in many bodies in the past; this is only one of the caravanserais. And
when you stay in a caravanserai you know that in the morning you have to
go.</p><p>So don't forget the journey, the ultimate journey. Remembering it
transforms the quality of your whole life. And meditation helps you to
discover the flame.</p><p>It is unfortunate that millions of people live only as the earth and
they never come to know their inner heaven. My effort here is to help
you to discover it. It is already the case, nothing has to be done --
just a little digging is needed. And it is a simple process, just like
digging a well in the earth; and soon you will find the water. Maybe a
few rocks have to be removed or sometimes maybe dynamite has to be used
(laughter). For that I have found the dynamic meditation -- that is the
dynamite!</p><p>Navajata means newly born. Sannyas is a birth.</p><p>Socrates says that the master is a midwife -- and he is right. The
master simply helps you to come out of a certain womb.</p><p>The first birth is the coming out of the womb of the mother. The
mother's womb is a physiological thing, but then one lives in a
psychological womb and the</p><p>master can bring you out of your psychological womb.</p><p>The moment you are out of your psychological womb, for the first time
you know that you are not the mind, you are something transcendental to
both body and mind. And to know it is to know all. Knowing it makes one
feel utterly contented, absolutely contented. One has come home, one has
found the goal; all desires are fulfilled, the deepest longing of the
heart is satisfied. And the moment there is no desire, no longing, that
is the moment when bliss happens, or one can say nirvana happens or god
happens. These are different words to say the same thing.</p><p>Unless one comes out of the mind one remains in a cocoon -- closed to
the wind, to the rain, to the sun, to the stars, to the infinity of
existence and to all its joys and all its gifts; and they are immense,
incalculable.</p><p>To remain confined to one's own mind is to live in a grave. To come
out of it is to allow the hidden splendour to be released. And with it
comes thousands of flowers -- love, freedom, light, silence.</p><p>-- How long will you be here?</p><p>-- Till the baby is born.</p><p>(One's eyes instinctively fall on Navajata's body. Perhaps she is
physically pregnant too; whatever the case, Osho chuckles in
response.)</p><p>-- That's good. I am your midwife! (laughter) Mandir means a
temple.</p><p>Man is a temple but from the outside you can only see the walls. It
is very strange that not only do people see you from the outside, you
also see yourself from the outside. You look in the mirror to find your
face, you look into people's eyes to find your image, you listen to
people's opinions to know who you are --</p><p>good, bad, moral, immoral, saint, sinner. This is really strange,
because we can know ourselves from within; there is no need for any
mirror, there is no need to depend on other's opinions, because their
opinions will 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on

cannot tell us anything about the deity within.</p><p>And sannyas is nothing but the change, the shift, the radical shift,
from looking at oneself from outside to looking at oneself from inside.
It is sitting inside and looking, not depending on other's opinions,
scriptures, etcetera, but just watching yourself from your innermost
core and asking 'Who am I?', not depending on anybody else's answer. One
has to find one's own answer, only that can be fulfilling. And the
moment you sit at the centre of your being and you watch, you are amazed
your body is only a temple, god is inside you. And there is no way to
find it from outside, there is no <em>need</em> to find it from the
outside.</p><p>Once you have discovered your god within yourself then you will be
able to see it in other people also, the same; you will know they are
also temples and that god is bound to be there because they are alive
and life is god.</p><p>To me life and god are synonymous, interchangeable. And if I have to
choose between the two words I would like to choose the word 'life'
instead of 'god', because 'god' has been exploited by the priests for so
long that they have made the word almost dirty, obscene. It is better to
use the word 'life' and not even with a capital 'L', but with a lower
case 'l'. Just the simple life, the ordinary life, is divine.</p><p>The moment you can see your god within, your life within, your truth
within, you will find it everywhere too. Then you will see it in the
trees, in the people, in the animals, everywhere you will see it.</p><p>Wherever life is, god is. Then the whole existence becomes his temple
and then there is no need to go to the Hindu temple or the Christian
temple or the Jewish temple -- that looks childish.</p><p>Dhyan Madira.</p><p>I am giving you a very paradoxical name for the simple reason that
life is paradoxical, existence is a paradox, hence it cannot be
understood by logic, because a paradox is beyond logic. To logic it
looks absurd. It can be understood</p><p>only by a very loving heart, not by a logical mind. One has to change
the gestalt from logic to love.</p><p>Your name means meditative drunkenness. Meditation means awareness;
and this is my observation, that as you become more meditative, both
things grow together in you. It is illogical, but what can I do? --</p><p>that's how it is. On one hand you become more alert, more aware; on
the other hand you become more drunk; and they go on growing
simultaneously. That's the beauty of it, because if one is simply aware
then it will be dry, without any juice. It will be arithmetical but
there will be no poetry in it; it will be scientific but something will
be missing in it. It will be objective but it will not have the inner
dimension of subjectivity, of interiority. It will be measurable but
that means it will be limited. It will not have the quality of
indefinability. It will not have any music; it will have mathematics but
no music.</p><p>Drunkenness means poetry, music, dance. And if there is only
drunkenness and no awareness then too something is missing; then you
become unconscious, you go into a coma. They balance each other, they
both nourish each other; they are opposite only for those who have not
experienced the state. For those who have experienced it, they are
complementary, not opposite. The drunkenness makes awareness green,
alive, flowering, and awareness makes the drunkenness not dark, not
unconscious, not falling into a coma; it keeps it above
unconsciousness.</p><p>So there is a kind of dance in it, but that dance remains fully
alert, conscious at the centre. And only when these two things happen
together is one able to understand life in its totality; otherwise the
approach is partial, and a partial approach is not going to give you
fulfilment. Only the whole can fulfil you.</p><p>For me to be whole is to be holy. And this is the most beautiful
whole!</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=is-the-grass-really-greener...>Is the Grass Really Greener...?</h3><p>Chapter #12</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part9>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

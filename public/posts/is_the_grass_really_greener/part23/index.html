It is for reference purposes only.]\nThis is your name: Swami Anand Ole. Anand means bliss. Ole means peaceful heart.\nPeace alone is not enough -- alone it is dead; it is alive only when it is blissful. Bliss is the breath for peace; without bliss there is no heartbeat in peace, then it is just a corpse. It is easier to attain peace if one is 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nready to renounce bliss -- and that's what monks and nuns have been doing down the ages all over the world: renouncing bliss in order to gain peace. But because it is easy and cheap it has no significance at all.\nOne can move into a mountain cave and live peacefully but there will be no song, there will be no joy, there will be no disturbance certainly and there will be no direction, but everything will be just okay. It will not be a dance, it will not be\nsomething overflowing.\nMy sannyasins have to understand very clearly that I would like you to be peaceful but not without bliss.\nAnd to attain bliss and peace together needs great skill and intelligence; it needs meditativeness. It is an art to bring these two poles together and create a higher synthesis out of them. Then bliss is peaceful and peace is blissful. Both together are more than just the combination of the two; something plus descends from the beyond. That's what has been called god.\nYou can call it life, truth, nirvana, but it only comes when both have been balanced and both are together like two wings of a bird.\nAnand Mitzi. Anand means bliss. Mitzi means fragrance.\nPleasure is a seed. It contains all possibilities of happiness and of bliss, but they are all hidden and dormant. And millions of people die only knowing the seed, but the seed is worthless in itself unless it finds the right soil and disappears in the soil and dies, only then is the plant born.\nHappiness is the plant with many branches and foliage. And when the tree starts flowering -- flowers are like joy -- the tree is rejoicing! Flowers symbolise the tree being ready to share. It has too much; it is in a dance, it wants to share its being, its joy. It is overflowing energy that becomes flowers. An undernourished tree wi ll not give flowers. It will be starving; even its leaves will be dull, sad, dying, on their deathbed. Its branches will not be alive and swaying in the wind and enjoying the sun. Unless it blooms it is not fulfilled.\nSo flowers are joyous, but bliss is like fragrance, even beyond the flowers. When flowers release the fragrance that is the culmination, the realisation of the potential in its totality.\nThe seed was very visible, very material, the fragrance is invisible, very immaterial. The seed was like a body and the fragrance is like a soul. Bliss is spiritual, pleasure is physical. Happiness belongs to the mind, joy belongs to the heart. And these are the four things to be understood, from the seed you have to move to the plant, from the plant to the flowers, from the flowers to the fragrance. Then life has arrived, then your destiny is fulfilled.\nIn the East we have called that moment Buddhahood; in the West it has been called Christ-consciousness, but it is the same moment. One has become just fragrance, and the fragrance merges with the whole, it disappears. That's exactly the meaning of the word 'nirvana'. It is one of the most beautiful words.\nWhen you blow out a candle it is said in Sanskrit that the candle has achieved nirvana -- 'nirvana' means blowing out a candle. The flame was there just a moment before, now either it is nowhere or it is everywhere. Both mean the same; nowhere and everywhere are synonymous. It has merged with the whole so it has no separate entity. Fragrance is nirvana. All that is gross and material has disappeared, only the subtlest has remained -- and that too is merged with the whole. There is no more any ego. Then only does one know what it is -- the bliss, the ecstasy -- for which we have been longing for thousands of lives.\nIt is possible! It needs just a little effort, just a little conscious, deliberate search -\n- because it is our potential so it can become actual.\nAnand Vincent. Anand means bliss, Vincent means a conqueror.\nA man without bliss is a beggar, a man with bliss is a conqueror, an emperor.\nWhile coming to India Alexander the Great went to see Diogenes -- a rare individual. He was lying naked on the bank of a river in the sun, taking a sunbath. He didn't even get up to welcome Alexander.\nAlexander asked him, \"Can I do something for you? I have heard stories about you, and I have always longed to see you and I am really happy to see such a blissful man. Can I do something for you?\"\nDiogenes thought for a while and he said, \"Yes, just stand a little further away because you are blocking the sun. Nothing else is needed because I am utterly fulfilled. This is the only difficulty that you are creating and it is you who is creating it; otherwise there is no difficulty at all!\"\nAlexander was shocked and embarrassed; he could not believe his ears, could not believe what Diogenes was saying. He could give Diogenes anything because he was the richest man in the world at that time, a world conqueror, but this man had not asked for anything. He really felt a beggar before Diogenes. He said,\n\"I am tremendously happy to meet you, and if God is going to give me another birth I will tell him, 'Don't 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nmake me Alexander; make me Diogenes.'\"\nThere is a story that they died on the same day. And while moving from the earthly plane to the unearthly world one has to cross a river -- Diogenes had died a few minutes before Alexander so he was ahead, and Alexander was following. Diogenes heard a noise and looked back. Alexander said, \"Strange that we are meeting again! Perhaps on this river there has never been a meeting of an emperor and a beggar\"\n-- because Diogenes was a beggar.\nDiogenes laughed and said, \"You are right. Just one correction you will have to make. You misunderstand who is the emperor and who is the beggar. I am the emperor and you are the beggar! Yes, certainly it is a rare incident on this river, it may not have happened before, it may not happen again, but I am the conqueror and you are just a beggar.\" And Alexander could not say a single word against it because that was the truth. He had come without ever knowing what bliss was, his whole life went down the drain, and this man had lived each moment of it so blissfully that certainly he was the emperor.\nBliss makes one victorious; bliss and only bliss is worth achieving. Nothing should be made more important in life than blissfulness. If you make anything else more important you will live in misery, you will never be a conqueror. And my sannyasins have to be emperors.\nHow long will you be here?\n-Two more days.\nThen come back again for at least three days! Because one has to achieve the fourth! (much laughter) You have to give at least three days for three stages and\nthen the fourth happens! Next time come for three days -- right? (much laughter) Jivan Teng. Jivan means life. Teng means to ascend.\nLife is a ladder and we live at the lowest rung. That's where we find ourselves at the time of birth, but we go on living there for the whole of our life. Many people think that just to be born is enough. Birth is only the beginning of a long pilgrimage, but the majority of people die on exactly the same spot where they were born. They have not moved even a single inch. Their life energy has remained on the same plane; it has not ascended, it has not gone upwards. They are still crawling on the earth; they have not found their wings yet, they have not even looked at the sky and the stars. They are too occupied with their own small things, they have no time to look upwards; and life really begins only when you start moving on the higher rungs of the ladder.\nMeditation is the only way to help you to move from one rung to another. Meditation means awareness.\nAs you become aware of the body you move beyond the body. Awareness means transcendence. When you become aware of your mind you move up another rung of the ladder. You are no more mind, you have gone beyond mind. The moment you become aware of your heart, you have moved beyond the heart.\nThese three are the most fundamental planes to be transcended. When you have moved beyond these three you come to your real self, the fourth, turiya. And only then does one know what life is all about. One comes to know the truth of life, the meaning of life and the immense splendour of life.\nDhyan Sadhana. Dhyan means meditation. Sadhana means the practice, the discipline.\nMy whole emphasis is on meditation because it is the master key; it opens all the locks, it opens all the doors and all the mysteries. Nothing else is needed. So one should concentrate one's whole energy on being meditative. And by meditation I means the art of watchfulness, awareness, alertness.\nThe first step is becoming aware of your bodily activities and actions: walking, sitting, standing -- just a silent awareness of what is going on on the physical plane. People are not aware of that, hence you can see many contradictions.\nFor example, a man may be smiling and yet his eyes may show anger. He himself is not aware of it. A man may not show something but if you know how to read his face you will be able to decipher it immediately, because he is so unaware that what he is hiding is bound to be expressed in some way or other.\nA psychologist was experimenting and he talked to many people belonging to different occupations -- a few monks, a few priests, a few rabbis, a few ordinary people, businessmen, bankers, all kinds of people. He gave them a pack of cards and each card had a picture of a sunset, a sunrise, mountains, this and that, and also a picture of a naked woman.\nA man was looking at the cards, and the psychologist was not looking at the cards, he was sitting in front of the man. But when the man came to the naked woman the psychologist would immediately say 'So now, you have come to the naked woman?' And the man was puzzled as to how he came to know. And 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\npeople who have been practising celibacy and saying that sex is sin -- priests and the monks -- even they would be immediately caught.\nThe simple trick was that the psychologist was watching their eyes. Their pupils became big the moment they saw the naked woman. Now, they didn't know what was happening to their eyes. And in fact one has no control over them. Even if those people had known they could not control them; they are beyond control.\nImmediately their pupils would become big. Your pupils become big only when you want to take something totally in, when you don't want to miss anything -- that makes your pupils bigger.\nIf you watch people's activities you will be surprised, they say one thing, they do something else and their faces express something else again. It is as if they are many people.\nA psychoanalyst said to a patient 'Through three months analysis with you I have\ndiscovered that you are a schizophrenic, a split personality.' The man said 'No, I am not,' then stood up and said 'Yes, I am,' then lay down again and said 'No, I am not!' Now he was not aware what he was doing; by saying 'I am, I am not, I am...' he was simply proving that the psychoanalyst was right!\nOne has to watch one's body very carefully. That gives you a deep understanding and makes you capable of watching your mind, which is more subtle.\nThe second step is that the mind has to be watched... what thoughts pass in the mind, what desires cross the mind? There is no need to analyse, there is no need to evaluate, no need to judge. Just watching, simply taking note that these are the thoughts that pass, these are the dreams that pass, these are the fantasies that pass, without any evaluation of good, bad, moral, immoral -- just watching -- will again give you a deeper capacity to watch. And then one can watch one's feelings of the heart, moods -- which are the subtlest.\nSuddenly you are in the grip of a mood -- it just comes like a breeze and you are sad or you are blissful for no reason at all.\nOne has to learn to watch these three things, body, mind, heart, action, thought, feeling. And these three take you to the fourth, which is the highest rung of the ladder: being.\nAction is the most outside thing and being, the most inside; action the outermost, being the innermost.\nSo start with action, with doing. Watch your doings, so slowly slowly thinking, then feeling and then being.\nThe moment you reach being you ascend to real life. For the first time you taste immortality, eternity.\nHow long will you be here?\n-- Three months.\n-- That's good. Exactly the right time! Nikhilananda means total bliss.\nOne should not be satisfied with less than that. One should remain divinely discontented with anything less than that. Sannyas is divine discontentment. It is the search for total bliss.\nBut all religions have been teaching contentment and because of their preachings people have become contented with whatsoever they have got, wherever they are. So you rarely come across a person who has attained bliss, intelligence, freedom, love, truth. It has become very rare and it is becoming rarer and rarer every day, for the simple reason that religions don't teach you a divine discontent, they don't give you fire.\nMy sannyasins have to be afire with a tremendous longing for total bliss. And I say don't settle with less than that because it is your birthright. You are meant to achieve it. You have been given all that is needed to achieve it. You are absolutely ready to take the jump. So gather courage and start the journey for absolute blissfulness. Nothing else can really give you contentment.\nYou can console yourself, you can try to satisfy yourself in some way; you can rationalize and you can remain wherever you are, thinking that this is all there is. This is not all there is, there is far more.\nThe Upanishads say 'Charaiveti, Charaiveti' -- go on, go on, there is no end to this journey. Go on until you become a god yourself.\nSampurna means the whole.\nWe are brought up with the false idea that we are separate from existence. We are brought up as egos, and that is the whole problem, the root cause of all other problems, because whatsoever we think, our thinking makes no difference to reality; reality remains the same. We are not separate from reality, we are one with it, but because of the idea that we are separate we get into unnecessary anxieties and worries. Our whole life becomes just a long anguish, a nightmare.\nJust by dropping the idea that you are separate, a miracle happens: all worries suddenly disappear. They used to look so big and so important and suddenly they are not there. Even death is no more there, because 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nif we are part of the whole we cannot die; we have always been and we will always be.\nSurrender the ego -- it is only a false notion. I ask my sannyasins to give to me that which you don't have, so that I can give you that which you already have. Give your ego to me so that you can have the whole. 'Why remain tethered to a small thing?\nThis whole universe is an organic unity. That is the meaning of Sampurna and that has to be dis-covered. Unless you discover it life is meaningless and a meaningless misery -- on one hand meaningless, on the other hand miserable. It is just an exercise in utter futility. But it all depends on you --\nyou can drop the ego in a single moment of understanding, just as one drops one's clothes -- because it is a false idea. Clothes are far more real.\nYou will have to unbutton and unbelt and do a few things before you can drop them, but the ego can be dropped instantly. You don't have to unbutton it, because it is not there in the first place, it is just an idea.\nBut the idea is creating so much hell for so many people.\nSannyas means getting rid of the ego and entering into the world, into the universe. Just like a dewdrop slipping into the ocean and becoming one with it.\nPrem Sagar. Prem means love. Sagar means ocean.\nOne should not be miserly about love, because the law of love is that the more you give, the more you have, the less you give, the less you have, and if you don't give at all it simply disappears from your heart.\nAnd if you go on pouring infinitely, it goes on growing in you infinitely. It is always in the same proportion as you give.\nOnce the arithmetic of love is understood life goes through a radical change. When you start giving love for no reason other than just for the sheer joy of it, the whole universe expands. Thousands of songs start falling on you; from each direction, from each nook and corner love starts flowing towards you.\nLife can become a festival of lights through love. It can become a spring; thousands of roses can bloom in your being. All that is needed is to share your love without any conditions, without asking for anything in return.\nSo let that be your work upon yourself: become loving and finally become love itself. That's the moment one discovers god within one's own being. God is another name of absolute love.\nHow long will you be here? A very long time.\nThat's good. Be here a very long time. Forever will do -- or a little longer! Akal means timelessness.\nMind is time. Time has two tenses, not three -- the past and the future; the present is not part of time.\nThe present is part of timelessness, it belongs to timelessness. To be in the now and in the here is to enter into eternity. And god is timeless and truth is timeless and we are timeless. All that truly exists is timeless.\nThat which does not exist is part of time. The past does not exist, it is no more; the future does not exist, it is not yet. Only the present, between the past and the future, just a small interval between the two, exists; and that small interval between the two is the only reality there is. But that small interval is infinite.\nAnd meditation means entering into the present.\nA sannyasin's lifestyle has to be completely free from the past and free from the future. The moment you are free from the past and the future you are in tune with the present. And that harmony with the present brings all joys, all benedictions, all blessings. It brings enlightenment. It brings flowers of love and those flowers start showering on you; day in, day out, they go on showering. Each moment becomes such an ecstasy, so exquisite, that there is no way to imagine it, there is no way to comprehend it through the mind; because the mind is time and time cannot comprehend that which is beyond time.\nTo know it, one has to enter into the present.\nThat's my whole teaching here: to live in the now. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nIs the Grass Really Greener...?

doing down the ages all over the world: renouncing bliss in order to
gain peace. But because it is easy and cheap it has no significance at
all.</p><p>One can move into a mountain cave and live peacefully but there will
be no song, there will be no joy, there will be no disturbance certainly
and there will be no direction, but everything will be just okay. It
will not be a dance, it will not be</p><p>something overflowing.</p><p>My sannyasins have to understand very clearly that I would like you
to be peaceful but not without bliss.</p><p>And to attain bliss and peace together needs great skill and
intelligence; it needs meditativeness. It is an art to bring these two
poles together and create a higher synthesis out of them. Then bliss is
peaceful and peace is blissful. Both together are more than just the
combination of the two; something plus descends from the beyond. That's
what has been called god.</p><p>You can call it life, truth, nirvana, but it only comes when both
have been balanced and both are together like two wings of a bird.</p><p>Anand Mitzi. Anand means bliss. Mitzi means fragrance.</p><p>Pleasure is a seed. It contains all possibilities of happiness and of
bliss, but they are all hidden and dormant. And millions of people die
only knowing the seed, but the seed is worthless in itself unless it
finds the right soil and disappears in the soil and dies, only then is
the plant born.</p><p>Happiness is the plant with many branches and foliage. And when the
tree starts flowering -- flowers are like joy -- the tree is rejoicing!
Flowers symbolise the tree being ready to share. It has too much; it is
in a dance, it wants to share its being, its joy. It is overflowing
energy that becomes flowers. An undernourished tree wi ll not give
flowers. It will be starving; even its leaves will be dull, sad, dying,
on their deathbed. Its branches will not be alive and swaying in the
wind and enjoying the sun. Unless it blooms it is not fulfilled.</p><p>So flowers are joyous, but bliss is like fragrance, even beyond the
flowers. When flowers release the fragrance that is the culmination, the
realisation of the potential in its totality.</p><p>The seed was very visible, very material, the fragrance is invisible,
very immaterial. The seed was like a body and the fragrance is like a
soul. Bliss is spiritual, pleasure is physical. Happiness belongs to the
mind, joy belongs to the heart. And these are the four things to be
understood, from the seed you have to move to the plant, from the plant
to the flowers, from the flowers to the fragrance. Then life has
arrived, then your destiny is fulfilled.</p><p>In the East we have called that moment Buddhahood; in the West it has
been called Christ-consciousness, but it is the same moment. One has
become just fragrance, and the fragrance merges with the whole, it
disappears. That's exactly the meaning of the word 'nirvana'. It is one
of the most beautiful words.</p><p>When you blow out a candle it is said in Sanskrit that the candle has
achieved nirvana -- 'nirvana' means blowing out a candle. The flame was
there just a moment before, now either it is nowhere or it is
everywhere. Both mean the same; nowhere and everywhere are synonymous.
It has merged with the whole so it has no separate entity. Fragrance is
nirvana. All that is gross and material has disappeared, only the
subtlest has remained -- and that too is merged with the whole. There is
no more any ego. Then only does one know what it is -- the bliss, the
ecstasy -- for which we have been longing for thousands of lives.</p><p>It is possible! It needs just a little effort, just a little
conscious, deliberate search -</p><p>- because it is our potential so it can become actual.</p><p>Anand Vincent. Anand means bliss, Vincent means a conqueror.</p><p>A man without bliss is a beggar, a man with bliss is a conqueror, an
emperor.</p><p>While coming to India Alexander the Great went to see Diogenes -- a
rare individual. He was lying naked on the bank of a river in the sun,
taking a sunbath. He didn't even get up to welcome Alexander.</p><p>Alexander asked him, "Can I do something for you? I have heard
stories about you, and I have always longed to see you and I am really
happy to see such a blissful man. Can I do something for you?"</p><p>Diogenes thought for a while and he said, "Yes, just stand a little
further away because you are blocking the sun. Nothing else is needed
because I am utterly fulfilled. This is the only difficulty that you are
creating and it is you who is creating it; otherwise there is no
difficulty at all!"</p><p>Alexander was shocked and embarrassed; he could not believe his ears,
could not believe what Diogenes was saying. He could give Diogenes
anything because he was the richest man in the world at that time, a
world conqueror, but this man had not asked for anything. He really felt
a beggar before Diogenes. He said,</p><p>"I am tremendously happy to meet you, and if God is going to give me
another birth I will tell him, 'Don't 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>make me Alexander; make me Diogenes.'"</p><p>There is a story that they died on the same day. And while moving
from the earthly plane to the unearthly world one has to cross a river
-- Diogenes had died a few minutes before Alexander so he was ahead, and
Alexander was following. Diogenes heard a noise and looked back.
Alexander said, "Strange that we are meeting again! Perhaps on this
river there has never been a meeting of an emperor and a beggar"</p><p>-- because Diogenes was a beggar.</p><p>Diogenes laughed and said, "You are right. Just one correction you
will have to make. You misunderstand who is the emperor and who is the
beggar. I am the emperor and you are the beggar! Yes, certainly it is a
rare incident on this river, it may not have happened before, it may not
happen again, but I am the conqueror and you are just a beggar." And
Alexander could not say a single word against it because that was the
truth. He had come without ever knowing what bliss was, his whole life
went down the drain, and this man had lived each moment of it so
blissfully that certainly he was the emperor.</p><p>Bliss makes one victorious; bliss and only bliss is worth achieving.
Nothing should be made more important in life than blissfulness. If you
make anything else more important you will live in misery, you will
never be a conqueror. And my sannyasins have to be emperors.</p><p>How long will you be here?</p><p>-Two more days.</p><p>Then come back again for at least three days! Because one has to
achieve the fourth! (much laughter) You have to give at least three days
for three stages and</p><p>then the fourth happens! Next time come for three days -- right?
(much laughter) Jivan Teng. Jivan means life. Teng means to ascend.</p><p>Life is a ladder and we live at the lowest rung. That's where we find
ourselves at the time of birth, but we go on living there for the whole
of our life. Many people think that just to be born is enough. Birth is
only the beginning of a long pilgrimage, but the majority of people die
on exactly the same spot where they were born. They have not moved even
a single inch. Their life energy has remained on the same plane; it has
not ascended, it has not gone upwards. They are still crawling on the
earth; they have not found their wings yet, they have not even looked at
the sky and the stars. They are too occupied with their own small
things, they have no time to look upwards; and life really begins only
when you start moving on the higher rungs of the ladder.</p><p>Meditation is the only way to help you to move from one rung to
another. Meditation means awareness.</p><p>As you become aware of the body you move beyond the body. Awareness
means transcendence. When you become aware of your mind you move up
another rung of the ladder. You are no more mind, you have gone beyond
mind. The moment you become aware of your heart, you have moved beyond
the heart.</p><p>These three are the most fundamental planes to be transcended. When
you have moved beyond these three you come to your real self, the
fourth, turiya. And only then does one know what life is all about. One
comes to know the truth of life, the meaning of life and the immense
splendour of life.</p><p>Dhyan Sadhana. Dhyan means meditation. Sadhana means the practice,
the discipline.</p><p>My whole emphasis is on meditation because it is the master key; it
opens all the locks, it opens all the doors and all the mysteries.
Nothing else is needed. So one should concentrate one's whole energy on
being meditative. And by meditation I means the art of watchfulness,
awareness, alertness.</p><p>The first step is becoming aware of your bodily activities and
actions: walking, sitting, standing -- just a silent awareness of what
is going on on the physical plane. People are not aware of that, hence
you can see many contradictions.</p><p>For example, a man may be smiling and yet his eyes may show anger. He
himself is not aware of it. A man may not show something but if you know
how to read his face you will be able to decipher it immediately,
because he is so unaware that what he is hiding is bound to be expressed
in some way or other.</p><p>A psychologist was experimenting and he talked to many people
belonging to different occupations -- a few monks, a few priests, a few
rabbis, a few ordinary people, businessmen, bankers, all kinds of
people. He gave them a pack of cards and each card had a picture of a
sunset, a sunrise, mountains, this and that, and also a picture of a
naked woman.</p><p>A man was looking at the cards, and the psychologist was not looking
at the cards, he was sitting in front of the man. But when the man came
to the naked woman the psychologist would immediately say 'So now, you
have come to the naked woman?' And the man was puzzled as to how he came
to know. And 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>people who have been practising celibacy and saying that sex is sin
-- priests and the monks -- even they would be immediately caught.</p><p>The simple trick was that the psychologist was watching their eyes.
Their pupils became big the moment they saw the naked woman. Now, they
didn't know what was happening to their eyes. And in fact one has no
control over them. Even if those people had known they could not control
them; they are beyond control.</p><p>Immediately their pupils would become big. Your pupils become big
only when you want to take something totally in, when you don't want to
miss anything -- that makes your pupils bigger.</p><p>If you watch people's activities you will be surprised, they say one
thing, they do something else and their faces express something else
again. It is as if they are many people.</p><p>A psychoanalyst said to a patient 'Through three months analysis with
you I have</p><p>discovered that you are a schizophrenic, a split personality.' The
man said 'No, I am not,' then stood up and said 'Yes, I am,' then lay
down again and said 'No, I am not!' Now he was not aware what he was
doing; by saying 'I am, I am not, I am...' he was simply proving that
the psychoanalyst was right!</p><p>One has to watch one's body very carefully. That gives you a deep
understanding and makes you capable of watching your mind, which is more
subtle.</p><p>The second step is that the mind has to be watched... what thoughts
pass in the mind, what desires cross the mind? There is no need to
analyse, there is no need to evaluate, no need to judge. Just watching,
simply taking note that these are the thoughts that pass, these are the
dreams that pass, these are the fantasies that pass, without any
evaluation of good, bad, moral, immoral -- just watching -- will again
give you a deeper capacity to watch. And then one can watch one's
feelings of the heart, moods -- which are the subtlest.</p><p>Suddenly you are in the grip of a mood -- it just comes like a breeze
and you are sad or you are blissful for no reason at all.</p><p>One has to learn to watch these three things, body, mind, heart,
action, thought, feeling. And these three take you to the fourth, which
is the highest rung of the ladder: being.</p><p>Action is the most outside thing and being, the most inside; action
the outermost, being the innermost.</p><p>So start with action, with doing. Watch your doings, so slowly slowly
thinking, then feeling and then being.</p><p>The moment you reach being you ascend to real life. For the first
time you taste immortality, eternity.</p><p>How long will you be here?</p><p>-- Three months.</p><p>-- That's good. Exactly the right time! Nikhilananda means total
bliss.</p><p>One should not be satisfied with less than that. One should remain
divinely discontented with anything less than that. Sannyas is divine
discontentment. It is the search for total bliss.</p><p>But all religions have been teaching contentment and because of their
preachings people have become contented with whatsoever they have got,
wherever they are. So you rarely come across a person who has attained
bliss, intelligence, freedom, love, truth. It has become very rare and
it is becoming rarer and rarer every day, for the simple reason that
religions don't teach you a divine discontent, they don't give you
fire.</p><p>My sannyasins have to be afire with a tremendous longing for total
bliss. And I say don't settle with less than that because it is your
birthright. You are meant to achieve it. You have been given all that is
needed to achieve it. You are absolutely ready to take the jump. So
gather courage and start the journey for absolute blissfulness. Nothing
else can really give you contentment.</p><p>You can console yourself, you can try to satisfy yourself in some
way; you can rationalize and you can remain wherever you are, thinking
that this is all there is. This is <em>not</em> all there is, there is
far more.</p><p>The Upanishads say 'Charaiveti, Charaiveti' -- go on, go on, there is
no end to this journey. Go on until you become a god yourself.</p><p>Sampurna means the whole.</p><p>We are brought up with the false idea that we are separate from
existence. We are brought up as egos, and that is the whole problem, the
root cause of all other problems, because whatsoever we think, our
thinking makes no difference to reality; reality remains the same. We
are not separate from reality, we are one with it, but because of the
idea that we are separate we get into unnecessary anxieties and worries.
Our whole life becomes just a long anguish, a nightmare.</p><p>Just by dropping the idea that you are separate, a miracle happens:
all worries suddenly disappear. They used to look so big and so
important and suddenly they are not there. Even death is no more there,
because 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>if we are part of the whole we cannot die; we have always been and we
will always be.</p><p>Surrender the ego -- it is only a false notion. I ask my sannyasins
to give to me that which you don't have, so that I can give you that
which you already have. Give your ego to me so that you can have the
whole. 'Why remain tethered to a small thing?</p><p>This whole universe is an organic unity. That is the meaning of
Sampurna and that has to be dis-covered. Unless you discover it life is
meaningless and a meaningless misery -- on one hand meaningless, on the
other hand miserable. It is just an exercise in utter futility. But it
all depends on you --</p><p>you can drop the ego in a single moment of understanding, just as one
drops one's clothes -- because it is a false idea. Clothes are far more
real.</p><p>You will have to unbutton and unbelt and do a few things before you
can drop them, but the ego can be dropped instantly. You don't have to
unbutton it, because it is not there in the first place, it is just an
idea.</p><p>But the idea is creating so much hell for so many people.</p><p>Sannyas means getting rid of the ego and entering into the world,
into the universe. Just like a dewdrop slipping into the ocean and
becoming one with it.</p><p>Prem Sagar. Prem means love. Sagar means ocean.</p><p>One should not be miserly about love, because the law of love is that
the more you give, the more you have, the less you give, the less you
have, and if you don't give at all it simply disappears from your
heart.</p><p>And if you go on pouring infinitely, it goes on growing in you
infinitely. It is always in the same proportion as you give.</p><p>Once the arithmetic of love is understood life goes through a radical
change. When you start giving love for no reason other than just for the
sheer joy of it, the whole universe expands. Thousands of songs start
falling on you; from each direction, from each nook and corner love
starts flowing towards you.</p><p>Life can become a festival of lights through love. It can become a
spring; thousands of roses can bloom in your being. All that is needed
is to share your love without any conditions, without asking for
anything in return.</p><p>So let that be your work upon yourself: become loving and finally
become love itself. That's the moment one discovers god within one's own
being. God is another name of absolute love.</p><p>How long will you be here? A very long time.</p><p>That's good. Be here a very long time. Forever will do -- or a little
longer! Akal means timelessness.</p><p>Mind is time. Time has two tenses, not three -- the past and the
future; the present is not part of time.</p><p>The present is part of timelessness, it belongs to timelessness. To
be in the now and in the here is to enter into eternity. And god is
timeless and truth is timeless and we are timeless. All that truly
exists is timeless.</p><p>That which does not exist is part of time. The past does not exist,
it is no more; the future does not exist, it is not yet. Only the
present, between the past and the future, just a small interval between
the two, exists; and that small interval between the two is the only
reality there is. But that small interval is infinite.</p><p>And meditation means entering into the present.</p><p>A sannyasin's lifestyle has to be completely free from the past and
free from the future. The moment you are free from the past and the
future you are in tune with the present. And that harmony with the
present brings all joys, all benedictions, all blessings. It brings
enlightenment. It brings flowers of love and those flowers start
showering on you; day in, day out, they go on showering. Each moment
becomes such an ecstasy, so exquisite, that there is no way to imagine
it, there is no way to comprehend it through the mind; because the mind
is time and time cannot comprehend that which is beyond time.</p><p>To know it, one has to enter into the present.</p><p>That's my whole teaching here: to live in the now. 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-4>Osho's books on

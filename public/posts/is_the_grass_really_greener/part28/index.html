Dhyan means meditation and the wolf represents two qualities cunningness and courage.\nThe first quality is a hindrance in meditation, but the second quality is of tremendous help. So just be half of the wolf! (laughter)\nThe mind is cunning but meditation cannot be cunning; meditation is innocent. Meditation simply means dropping the whole structure of the mind, and cunningness is part of it.\nSecondly, courage is never part of the mind. Mind is always a coward. because of its cowardliness it becomes cunning. Cunningness is not a quality of the courageous. The courageous person is never calculating; he knows how to risk, he enjoys risking. And he trusts his intelligence -- why should he be cunning? Cunningness simply means you are not trusting your own intelligence, so you have to find a substitute for it. Only unintelligent people are cunning. And mind is never intelligent. It is cunning, calculative -- intellectual, certainly, but never intelligent -- and very cowardly. That's why it clings to the known and is always afraid of the unknown. It clings to the past and is afraid of the new. It remains within the boundary of the familiar and never wants to cross the boundary of the\nfamiliar.\nThe uncharted is scary for the mind, but the uncharted is real life, the unknown and the adventure for the unknown is the only joy there is. Immense courage is needed. Meditation is intelligent, hence there is no need for cunningness. Meditation releases your intelligence. It drops the mind and encounters reality directly. And dropping the mind is dropping the familiar, the past, the known.\nMeditativeness is immense courage, but life belongs to the courageous, bliss belongs to the courageous, love belongs to the courageous, truth belongs to the courageous.\nAnand Bettina. Anand means bliss. Bettina means consecrated to god. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThe only possibility of one's knowing bliss is merging with the whole, dropping all separation, dropping the very idea of the ego. The moment you drop the ego bliss explodes. The more you become enclosed in the ego, the more miserable you become, the more dark, dismal, sad, frustrated, your life is, because ego surrounds you like a capsule, it becomes an imprisonment; it destroys your freedom.\nFreedom is the meeting and merging and melting with all that is -- stars and flowers and rivers and mountains, people and birds and animals, with all that is. God is only a name for this totality.\nThe moment you surrender yourself to the whole, immediately life is transformed, instantly misery disappears and bliss arrives, and arrives forever -- because once you have tasted it and once you know how it comes there is no need to be miserable again. It is impossible really to be miserable again.\nPeople are miserable because they have never tasted bliss, so they have become accustomed to misery, they think that's what life is all about, that there is nothing\nmore to life. And once they start settling with this idea, they are already dead.\nSo people die near about the aye of twenty-one. That's why every country thinks a person becomes adult when he is twenty-one; in fact he is dead! (laughter) It is a strange thing that all over the world twenty-one seems to be accepted as the age when a person becomes adult. But the reality is that that the time when he drops all adventure, when he drops all longings, when he drops all dreams, when he settles with the ordinary, mundane life, when he starts thinking that this is all there is. Then the society thinks he is not adult; but he is really dead. He may actually die after sixty years but that life is posthumous. After twenty-one people are living posthumous existences. But if they can drop their ego any moment, at any time, at any age, again they become young, suddenly they are fresh again, innocent, again there is awe and wonder, again the aspiration to reach the stars. Again the poetry has come back!\nIt is a beautiful name, Bettina: it simply defines the whole idea of sannyas; surrendering the ego to the whole. The moment you are not, for the first time you are -- remember it!\nVeet Barbara. Veet means transcendence. Barbara means a stranger.\nThe ordinary life gives you again and again the feeling as if you are a stranger here, as if you don't belong to existence, as if you are alien, a foreigner, something like an accident, that you were not supposed to be, that you were not meant to be, that it is just a coincidence that you have happened, that existence has no need of you. This is the predominant idea all over the world, and moreso in the modern mind, because in the past man was living a more childish life -- more primitive, more wild, uncivilised, raw, and people were not thinking much about life -- there was no time.\nThe whole energy and time was absorbed by the struggle to survive. For the first time in the modern world millions of people are having a little bit of time to think about what this life is all about -- and they are all feeling like strangers. They are all feeling unwanted and that makes a very deep wound. If you are unwanted, the natural consequence is a suicidal tendency then why go on, for what? Nobody needs you, nobody is going to miss you. Stars will be there and flowers will bloom and birds will sing and the sun will rise, and everything will go on continuing; summer will come and winter will come and rain. You will not be missed, and somebody will replace you! But this whole idea is basically\nwrong.\nWe are not accidental, we are very essential -- far more essential than the stars, the sun, the moon, because we are the only entities which have become a little bit conscious. Existence has come to flowering in man. Yes, trees are beautiful and the roses are beautiful, but nothing compared to the flower of consciousness. It is just a small flower but it can become very big; it can become a Buddha, a Christ, a Zarathustra -- it all depends on us.\nThe basic requirement is the change of the , you are not a stranger, not accidental\n-- you are immensely needed. Existence has created you for a certain purpose. There is a hidden hand behind you. There is a destiny to be fulfilled, a message to be delivered, a life to be lived in deep harmony with the whole. And you will be helping the whole evolution.\nThe greatest need of man is to be needed. And when one feels that the whole existence needs one, a great respect for oneself arises. And that respect triggers respect for others. A great love for oneself arises and that love triggers love for others. Then suddenly you find you are not a foreigner, not a stranger; this existence is yours, you belong to it, it belongs to you. And then a totally new story opens, a new chapter of life. That's what sannyas is: the beginning of a new chapter.\nSo go beyond the idea of being a stranger, transcend that idea, drop it completely. And it can be dropped very easily if one becomes a little silent, gets out of the mind, puts the mind into a state of non-functioning; in that stillness one immediately experiences the at-tunement, the at-onement with existence. And from that 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nmoment onwards life is a dance, a festival, a sheer blessing.\n(David is from the States. He is billed as a painter. Osho gives him the name Premgit, and then observes without any preliminaries:)\nYou look angry (Premgit's face breaks into a smile.)... but that's the situation all over the world: the younger generation is an angry generation. Everybody is angry -- angry at god, angry at existence, angry at everything. Such anger has never been known before. For the first time man has shown his anger towards reality, existence, so it is not specific to you, it is the very atmosphere today.\nBut through anger one cannot live a creative life; life becomes destructive. And before you destroy anything you have to destroy yourself. And people are being destructive in every possible way. All over the world there is anarchy, chaos. In fact it has become very symbolic of being young, to be an anarchist, to create chaos.\nIf there is some purpose behind destruction, if you are doing it to create something, it is beautiful, but if destruction becomes a goal unto itself -- destruction for destruction's sake -- then we are committing suicide.\nSannyas is becoming a loving being. It is just the opposite of being angry, it is just the opposite of being in rage. And I can understand why people are angry, their life is so unfulfilled. It is absolutely understandable. Life is not giving them anything and people are no more ready to believe in a heaven beyond death, they want it right now. And there is nothing wrong in asking for it right now but it is not a question of asking, you have to create it.\nOne can live in hell, one can live in heaven -- it all depends on how you live, on what lifestyle you choose. Sannyas means love is going to be your life-style, creativity is going to be your worship, aesthetic sensibility is going to be your meditation. And sharing whatsoever you have brings many flowers to your being. They happen only when you start sharing.\nIf a tree is a miser it will not blossom. Fortunately trees are not misers, they are not Jews, otherwise they would not blossom. Before blossoming they would think 'Why? For what? And how much am I going to get out of it?' Because trees don't bother about getting anything, they blossom and release their fragrance. But in that release they come to a fulfilment, a tremendous contentment.\nShare your life -- that's what love is. Share your energies, share your creativities and create a small aesthetic aura around yourself. Instead of anger, create love. It is the same energy. When love goes sour it becomes anger. So in a way it is a good indication that energy is there, it is just going in the wrong direction. And\nmy effort here is to change the younger generation into flower people!\nBecome a song of love, not a curse of anger, and immediately you will see that life is an immense gift.\nWe are not worthy of it, yet some unknown source of energy has showered it upon us. We have received it not because we deserve it but because existence has it in such abundance and out of its abundance it has given to us.\nAnd then there is gratitude. That gratitude I call prayer. And when one's heart is prayerful, one is religious, simply religious -- not Christian, not Hindu, not Mohammedan, simply religious. I teach a religionless religiousness.\nHow long will you be here?\n-- I don't know.\n-- Be here until your anger turns into love! (Premgit grins and the group breaks into laughter.) Good, good.\nPremdip means a light of love.\nLove is my message. Love is my Gita, my Koran, my Bible. And a man without love is a man without light, a house without light, just full of darkness. Gautam the Buddha used to say that when the house is dark and there is no lamp inside it attracts thieves, enemies, the wrong kind of people. When the house is full of light thieves don't dare come close to it.\nThe same is true about man's being, if there is the light of love inside you many thieves will not dare come close to you. Hatred, anger, jealousy, ambition, ego -- all are thieves because they go on stealing your being from you, your joy from you. They are parasites, but they can come only because you are not lighted within.\nAnd there is no need to fight with them, because the fight is not going to help at all. All that is needed is to light a candle inside. Love is just a small candle, but it is enough. It dispels darkness and it creates fear in the enemies, in the thieves, they cannot come close to you.\nAnd light is not only light, it is also warmth. These are the two aspects of the\nsame thing love and 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nwarmth, light and warmth. Love is the coin; these are the two aspects, warmth and light.\nAnd a man with light and warmth starts living at the maximum for the first time. People can either live at the alpha point or at the omega point -- both paints are available. People live at the alpha point, at the lowest. They live minimally, just one per cent at the most; ninety-nine per cent remains unlived.\nPsychologists have been researching and they say that the very talented people live five per cent to seven per cent, and the people we call geniuses -- like Albert Einstein or Leonardo da Vinci or Shakespeare or Mozart -- they live at the most near about fifteen per cent.\nOf course psychologists have not yet thought about people like Gautam the Buddha, Lao Tzu, Zarathustra, Jesus. In fact they don't have any way to measure these people. They cannot accept that they are lacking the methodology, so rather than accepting their own limitations, they condemn Jesus as abnormal, insane, crazy. But the real thing is that if you think that the genius lives at fifteen per cent and a person lives at one hundred per cent he will look crazy. His life will be such a flame, his torch will be burning from both ends; he will look crazy, he will look insane. But only these few people have really lived; others have only pretended to live, others have gone through empty gestures of living.\nTo live authentically the most essential thing needed is a heart full of love. And the heart is full of love, we just have to allow it to open up. It is like a bud: if we allow it to open it becomes a lotus flower.\nIn the past we have actually called the fully enlightened person a one-thousand petalled lotus. You must have seen statues of Buddha and pictures of Buddha, sitting on a one-thousand petalled lotus. That represents the ultimate flowering of consciousness. But love is the beginning and love is the end.\nSangit Sarjano. Sangit means music. Sarjano means creativity.\nLife can either be lived as mathematics or as music, either as prose or as poetry. And the choice is open.\nOne comes just like a tabula rasa, a clean slate: nothing is written on it, you have to write your story. And because the people all around you are living for money, for power, for prestige, respectability, and all that rubbish, one starts imitating them, life becomes just mathematics. It loses all music.\nAnd a life dominated by mathematics is not life at all. It is phony and it is joyless. Life can have joy only if it is lived as music. mind is mathematics, meditation is music. Mind is prose, meditation is poetry.\nSo one has to shift from the mind to a state of no-mind. That state of no-mind I call meditation.\nThe mathematical, the prose life can accumulate things of the outside world but it cannot be creative.\nOne can become wealthy, one can even become the conqueror of the world, but deep down one will remain very poor. The inner richness comes to only those few people who are creative. What they create is not the point -- it may be a painting, it may poetry, it may be anything, just a small garden, just a beautiful house, just delicious food. Whatsoever it is, it is not the point, but they are not doing it for any other ulterior motiveS they are enjoying doing it. The very doing of it is their joy, the thing in itself is their reward. If other rewards come, that's besides the point; their real joy is in doing the thing. And they are so absorbed, abandoned, that they lose their ego.\nSo these two things are of great importance living life as music, creating a harmony in everything that you do, in everything that you are, and out of that harmony not relaxing into an escape -- which religious people have done down the ages. When you are in harmony the second thing is that your harmony has to be creative. You have to enrich the world, you have to leave the world a little better, a little more beautiful than you found it; only then does one feel contentment, only then does one live and die joyously.\nDhyandas means surrendered to meditation.\nMeditation is the key word, it is a master key. It unlocks all the mysteries of life. Nothing else is needed, just a meditative awareness, and one finds one's home, one's source and one's goal. The whole of religion can be reduced to a single word and that is 'meditation'.\nAnd one of the most beautiful things about meditation is that it can be done by a child, by a young man, by an old man, because it is not an exercise of the body or the mind; it is just the opposite: it is relaxation of body-mind. So even on one's deathbed one can create Buddhahood. Even in the last moment of life one can open up and can die a beautiful death, a death that becomes a door to the divine.\nSo now this is going to be your whole work -- and I say the word 'work' with inverted commas, because it is not like work at all; it is more like play: relaxing, sitting or lying down, doing nothing, just being. Be alert and watchful, watchful of what is happening all around, the traffic noise, the train passing by, the thunder in the clouds, a dog starting to bark, a child starting to cry -- just silently with closed eyes, available to all that is happening, not trying to concentrate on anything... because that is effort, that is tiring. And 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nconcentration is of the mind, it is not meditation. Just relax, be available and open. Noises will come and go, but they will not distract you. In fact they will enhance your silence, they will become a background to your silence.\nThe moment you have found the knack of how to make the world, the noisy world, a backdrop to your silence, a contrast to your silence, you have found the secret. Then any moment one can close one's eyes and disappear into one's centre. Then on the circumference the cyclone goes on and on, but one remains centred, without any distraction. Then life has no disturbance in it, neither has death any disturbance in it.\nAnd if one can remain centred in life and death one has found god. That centering is god. There is no other god. One has found eternity, immortality, deathlessness.\nHow long will you be here?\n-- I had ten days here, I leave tomorrow.\n-- Good. Then if you can find time, come back, otherwise meditate there and I will be coming there!\n(laughter) Good.\nVishnudas. Vishnu is one of the names of god. Vishnudas means surrendered to god.\nGod is not a person, not a creator; god is the soul of existence. Existence is his body, his periphery, his manifest form, and god is existence's hidden centre, its unmanifest form.\nSo god is not separate from life but life's very centre, its very essential core. Religions have done a disservice to humanity by teaching people to renounce life because if you renounce life you are renouncing god. You cannot find god anywhere else. God has tc be found here and now and god has to be found in this and all the religions have been teaching you about that, the far away, the beyond. They have all helped man to postpone because the beyond is far away; it is not a question to be decided today. One can wait --\ntomorrow, perhaps the day after tomorrow, in old age, or maybe after death or maybe next life -- there is no hurry.\nHence religiousness became only a formality and churches have become just like Rotary clubs where a few phony people gather together and start saying 'Hello. How are you?' and talk about the weather. In the Rotary club they talk about the weather, in the churches they talk about god -- but it is the same. Whether it is weather or god makes no difference.\nThey don't mean it; something has to be said, otherwise silence becomes awkward. And it is just a sunday phenomenon every Sunday you so to the church. It is prestigious, respectable, and it is good to meet people, to shake hands and to exchange gossips.\nThe reason why it happened that the whole of religion became phony was that these people were teaching a life-negative attitude. Only pathological people can\nbecome interested in something that is against life; hence your so-called saints are almost psychologically ill, neurotic. The really healthy people cannot be against list. And the healthy religion can only be life-affirmative. To me god is synonymous with life. Life is his dance and he is the dancer. Life is his song and he is the singer. And if you want to find the singer you have to enter the song, if you want to find the dancer you have to learn the dance. And you have to penetrate into the dance -- only then will you be able to find god.\nThat's what I mean by surrendering to god: surrender to this beautiful universe, to its multi-dimensional variety. These are all gods in different forms, all aspects of god. Live it totally, intensely, passionately --\nthat's what I call surrender to god.\nMy sannyasin is not a monk and nun in the old sense; he is a totally new kind of religious person.

diary, which has been scanned and cleaned up. It is for reference
purposes only.]</p><p>Dhyan Wolfgang. Dhyan means meditation and the wolf represents two
qualities cunningness and courage.</p><p>The first quality is a hindrance in meditation, but the second
quality is of tremendous help. So just be half of the wolf!
(laughter)</p><p>The mind is cunning but meditation cannot be cunning; meditation is
innocent. Meditation simply means dropping the whole structure of the
mind, and cunningness is part of it.</p><p>Secondly, courage is never part of the mind. Mind is always a coward.
because of its cowardliness it becomes cunning. Cunningness is not a
quality of the courageous. The courageous person is never calculating;
he knows how to risk, he enjoys risking. And he trusts his intelligence
-- why should he be cunning? Cunningness simply means you are not
trusting your own intelligence, so you have to find a substitute for it.
Only unintelligent people are cunning. And mind is never intelligent. It
is cunning, calculative -- intellectual, certainly, but never
intelligent -- and very cowardly. That's why it clings to the known and
is always afraid of the unknown. It clings to the past and is afraid of
the new. It remains within the boundary of the familiar and never wants
to cross the boundary of the</p><p>familiar.</p><p>The uncharted is scary for the mind, but the uncharted is real life,
the unknown and the adventure for the unknown is the only joy there is.
Immense courage is needed. Meditation is intelligent, hence there is no
need for cunningness. Meditation releases your intelligence. It drops
the mind and encounters reality directly. And dropping the mind is
dropping the familiar, the past, the known.</p><p>Meditativeness is immense courage, but life belongs to the
courageous, bliss belongs to the courageous, love belongs to the
courageous, truth belongs to the courageous.</p><p>Anand Bettina. Anand means bliss. Bettina means consecrated to god.

CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>The only possibility of one's knowing bliss is merging with the
whole, dropping all separation, dropping the very idea of the ego. The
moment you drop the ego bliss explodes. The more you become enclosed in
the ego, the more miserable you become, the more dark, dismal, sad,
frustrated, your life is, because ego surrounds you like a capsule, it
becomes an imprisonment; it destroys your freedom.</p><p>Freedom is the meeting and merging and melting with all that is --
stars and flowers and rivers and mountains, people and birds and
animals, with all that is. God is only a name for this totality.</p><p>The moment you surrender yourself to the whole, immediately life is
transformed, instantly misery disappears and bliss arrives, and arrives
forever -- because once you have tasted it and once you know how it
comes there is no need to be miserable again. It is impossible really to
be miserable again.</p><p>People are miserable because they have never tasted bliss, so they
have become accustomed to misery, they think that's what life is all
about, that there is nothing</p><p>more to life. And once they start settling with this idea, they are
already dead.</p><p>So people die near about the aye of twenty-one. That's why every
country thinks a person becomes adult when he is twenty-one; in fact he
is dead! (laughter) It is a strange thing that all over the world
twenty-one seems to be accepted as the age when a person becomes adult.
But the reality is that that the time when he drops all adventure, when
he drops all longings, when he drops all dreams, when he settles with
the ordinary, mundane life, when he starts thinking that this is all
there is. Then the society thinks he is not adult; but he is really
dead. He may actually die after sixty years but that life is posthumous.
After twenty-one people are living posthumous existences. But if they
can drop their ego <em>any</em> moment, at <em>any</em> time, at
<em>any</em> age, again they become young, suddenly they are fresh
again, innocent, again there is awe and wonder, again the aspiration to
reach the stars. Again the poetry has come back!</p><p>It is a beautiful name, Bettina: it simply defines the whole idea of
sannyas; surrendering the ego to the whole. The moment you are not, for
the first time you are -- remember it!</p><p>Veet Barbara. Veet means transcendence. Barbara means a stranger.</p><p>The ordinary life gives you again and again the feeling as if you are
a stranger here, as if you don't belong to existence, as if you are
alien, a foreigner, something like an accident, that you were not
supposed to be, that you were not meant to be, that it is just a
coincidence that you have happened, that existence has no need of you.
This is the predominant idea all over the world, and moreso in the
modern mind, because in the past man was living a more childish life --
more primitive, more wild, uncivilised, raw, and people were not
thinking much about life -- there was no time.</p><p>The whole energy and time was absorbed by the struggle to survive.
For the first time in the modern world millions of people are having a
little bit of time to think about what this life is all about -- and
they are all feeling like strangers. They are all feeling unwanted and
that makes a very deep wound. If you are unwanted, the natural
consequence is a suicidal tendency then why go on, for what? Nobody
needs you, nobody is going to miss you. Stars will be there and flowers
will bloom and birds will sing and the sun will rise, and everything
will go on continuing; summer will come and winter will come and rain.
You will not be missed, and somebody will replace you! But this whole
idea is basically</p><p>wrong.</p><p>We are not accidental, we are very essential -- far more essential
than the stars, the sun, the moon, because we are the only entities
which have become a little bit conscious. Existence has come to
flowering in man. Yes, trees are beautiful and the roses are beautiful,
but nothing compared to the flower of consciousness. It is just a small
flower but it can become very big; it can become a Buddha, a Christ, a
Zarathustra -- it all depends on us.</p><p>The basic requirement is the change of the , you are not a stranger,
not accidental</p><p>-- you are immensely needed. Existence has created you for a certain
purpose. There is a hidden hand behind you. There is a destiny to be
fulfilled, a message to be delivered, a life to be lived in deep harmony
with the whole. And you will be helping the whole evolution.</p><p>The greatest need of man is to be needed. And when one feels that the
whole existence needs one, a great respect for oneself arises. And that
respect triggers respect for others. A great love for oneself arises and
that love triggers love for others. Then suddenly you find you are not a
foreigner, not a stranger; this existence is yours, you belong to it, it
belongs to you. And then a totally new story opens, a new chapter of
life. That's what sannyas is: the beginning of a new chapter.</p><p>So go beyond the idea of being a stranger, transcend that idea, drop
it completely. And it can be dropped very easily if one becomes a little
silent, gets out of the mind, puts the mind into a state of
non-functioning; in that stillness one immediately experiences the
at-tunement, the at-onement with existence. And from that 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:justify id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on

the name Premgit, and then observes without any preliminaries:)</p><p>You look angry (Premgit's face breaks into a smile.)... but that's
the situation all over the world: the younger generation <em>is</em> an
angry generation. Everybody is angry -- angry at god, angry at
existence, angry at everything. Such anger has never been known before.
For the first time man has shown his anger towards reality, existence,
so it is not specific to you, it is the very atmosphere today.</p><p>But through anger one cannot live a creative life; life becomes
destructive. And before you destroy anything you have to destroy
yourself. And people are being destructive in every possible way. All
over the world there is anarchy, chaos. In fact it has become very
symbolic of being young, to be an anarchist, to create chaos.</p><p>If there is some purpose behind destruction, if you are doing it to
create something, it is beautiful, but if destruction becomes a goal
unto itself -- destruction for destruction's sake -- then we are
committing suicide.</p><p>Sannyas is becoming a loving being. It is just the opposite of being
angry, it is just the opposite of being in rage. And I can understand
why people are angry, their life is so unfulfilled. It is absolutely
understandable. Life is not giving them anything and people are no more
ready to believe in a heaven beyond death, they want it right now. And
there is nothing wrong in asking for it right now but it is not a
question of asking, you have to create it.</p><p>One can live in hell, one can live in heaven -- it all depends on how
you live, on what lifestyle you choose. Sannyas means love is going to
be your life-style, creativity is going to be your worship, aesthetic
sensibility is going to be your meditation. And sharing whatsoever you
have brings many flowers to your being. They happen only when you start
sharing.</p><p>If a tree is a miser it will not blossom. Fortunately trees are not
misers, they are not Jews, otherwise they would not blossom. Before
blossoming they would think 'Why? For what? And how much am I going to
get out of it?' Because trees don't bother about getting anything, they
blossom and release their fragrance. But in that release they come to a
fulfilment, a tremendous contentment.</p><p>Share your life -- that's what love is. Share your energies, share
your creativities and create a small aesthetic aura around yourself.
Instead of anger, create love. It is the same energy. When love goes
sour it becomes anger. So in a way it is a good indication that energy
is there, it is just going in the wrong direction. And</p><p>my effort here is to change the younger generation into flower
people!</p><p>Become a song of love, not a curse of anger, and immediately you will
see that life is an immense gift.</p><p>We are not worthy of it, yet some unknown source of energy has
showered it upon us. We have received it not because we deserve it but
because existence has it in such abundance and out of its abundance it
has given to us.</p><p>And then there is gratitude. That gratitude I call prayer. And when
one's heart is prayerful, one is religious, simply religious -- not
Christian, not Hindu, not Mohammedan, simply religious. I teach a
religionless religiousness.</p><p>How long will you be here?</p><p>-- I don't know.</p><p>-- Be here until your anger turns into love! (Premgit grins and the
group breaks into laughter.) Good, good.</p><p>Premdip means a light of love.</p><p>Love is my message. Love is my Gita, my Koran, my Bible. And a man
without love is a man without light, a house without light, just full of
darkness. Gautam the Buddha used to say that when the house is dark and
there is no lamp inside it attracts thieves, enemies, the wrong kind of
people. When the house is full of light thieves don't dare come close to
it.</p><p>The same is true about man's being, if there is the light of love
inside you many thieves will not dare come close to you. Hatred, anger,
jealousy, ambition, ego -- all are thieves because they go on stealing
your being from you, your joy from you. They are parasites, but they can
come only because you are not lighted within.</p><p>And there is no need to fight with them, because the fight is not
going to help at all. All that is needed is to light a candle inside.
Love is just a small candle, but it is enough. It dispels darkness and
it creates fear in the enemies, in the thieves, they cannot come close
to you.</p><p>And light is not only light, it is also warmth. These are the two
aspects of the</p><p>same thing love and 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on

aspects, warmth and light.</p><p>And a man with light and warmth starts living at the maximum for the
first time. People can either live at the alpha point or at the omega
point -- both paints are available. People live at the alpha point, at
the lowest. They live minimally, just one per cent at the most;
ninety-nine per cent remains unlived.</p><p>Psychologists have been researching and they say that the very
talented people live five per cent to seven per cent, and the people we
call geniuses -- like Albert Einstein or Leonardo da Vinci or
Shakespeare or Mozart -- they live at the most near about fifteen per
cent.</p><p>Of course psychologists have not yet thought about people like Gautam
the Buddha, Lao Tzu, Zarathustra, Jesus. In fact they don't have any way
to measure these people. They cannot accept that they are lacking the
methodology, so rather than accepting their own limitations, they
condemn Jesus as abnormal, insane, crazy. But the real thing is that if
you think that the genius lives at fifteen per cent and a person lives
at one hundred per cent he will look crazy. His life will be such a
flame, his torch will be burning from both ends; he will look crazy, he
will look insane. But only these few people have really lived; others
have only pretended to live, others have gone through empty gestures of
living.</p><p>To live authentically the most essential thing needed is a heart full
of love. And the heart <em>is</em> full of love, we just have to allow
it to open up. It is like a bud: if we allow it to open it becomes a
lotus flower.</p><p>In the past we have actually called the fully enlightened person a
one-thousand petalled lotus. You must have seen statues of Buddha and
pictures of Buddha, sitting on a one-thousand petalled lotus. That
represents the ultimate flowering of consciousness. But love is the
beginning and love is the end.</p><p>Sangit Sarjano. Sangit means music. Sarjano means creativity.</p><p>Life can either be lived as mathematics or as music, either as prose
or as poetry. And the choice is open.</p><p>One comes just like a tabula rasa, a clean slate: nothing is written
on it, <em>you</em> have to write your story. And because the people all
around you are living for money, for power, for prestige,
respectability, and all that rubbish, one starts imitating them, life
becomes just mathematics. It loses all music.</p><p>And a life dominated by mathematics is not life at all. It is phony
and it is joyless. Life can have joy only if it is lived as music. mind
is mathematics, meditation is music. Mind is prose, meditation is
poetry.</p><p>So one has to shift from the mind to a state of no-mind. That state
of no-mind I call meditation.</p><p>The mathematical, the prose life can accumulate things of the outside
world but it cannot be creative.</p><p>One can become wealthy, one can even become the conqueror of the
world, but deep down one will remain very poor. The inner richness comes
to only those few people who are creative. What they create is not the
point -- it may be a painting, it may poetry, it may be anything, just a
small garden, just a beautiful house, just delicious food. Whatsoever it
is, it is not the point, but they are not doing it for any other
ulterior motiveS they are enjoying doing it. The very doing of it is
their joy, the thing in itself is their reward. If other rewards come,
that's besides the point; their real joy is in doing the thing. And they
are so absorbed, abandoned, that they lose their ego.</p><p>So these two things are of great importance living life as music,
creating a harmony in everything that you do, in everything that you
are, and out of that harmony not relaxing into an escape -- which
religious people have done down the ages. When you are in harmony the
second thing is that your harmony has to be creative. You have to enrich
the world, you have to leave the world a little better, a little more
beautiful than you found it; only then does one feel contentment, only
then does one live and die joyously.</p><p>Dhyandas means surrendered to meditation.</p><p>Meditation is the key word, it is a master key. It unlocks all the
mysteries of life. Nothing else is needed, just a meditative awareness,
and one finds one's home, one's source and one's goal. The whole of
religion can be reduced to a single word and that is 'meditation'.</p><p>And one of the most beautiful things about meditation is that it can
be done by a child, by a young man, by an old man, because it is not an
exercise of the body or the mind; it is just the opposite: it is
relaxation of body-mind. So even on one's deathbed one can create
Buddhahood. Even in the last moment of life one can open up and can die
a beautiful death, a death that becomes a door to the divine.</p><p>So now this is going to be your whole work -- and I say the word
'work' with inverted commas, because it is not like work at all; it is
more like play: relaxing, sitting or lying down, doing nothing, just
being. Be alert and watchful, watchful of what is happening all around,
the traffic noise, the train passing by, the thunder in the clouds, a
dog starting to bark, a child starting to cry -- just silently with
closed eyes, available to all that is happening, not trying to
concentrate on anything... because that is effort, that is tiring. And

available and open. Noises will come and go, but they will not distract
you. In fact they will enhance your silence, they will become a
background to your silence.</p><p>The moment you have found the knack of how to make the world, the
noisy world, a backdrop to your silence, a contrast to your silence, you
have found the secret. Then any moment one can close one's eyes and
disappear into one's centre. Then on the circumference the cyclone goes
on and on, but one remains centred, without any distraction. Then life
has no disturbance in it, neither has death any disturbance in it.</p><p>And if one can remain centred in life and death one has found god.
That centering is god. There is no other god. One has found eternity,
immortality, deathlessness.</p><p>How long will you be here?</p><p>-- I had ten days here, I leave tomorrow.</p><p>-- Good. Then if you can find time, come back, otherwise meditate
there and I will be coming there!</p><p>(laughter) Good.</p><p>Vishnudas. Vishnu is one of the names of god. Vishnudas means
surrendered to god.</p><p>God is not a person, not a creator; god is the soul of existence.
Existence is his body, his periphery, his manifest form, and god is
existence's hidden centre, its unmanifest form.</p><p>So god is not separate from life but life's very centre, its very
essential core. Religions have done a disservice to humanity by teaching
people to renounce life because if you renounce life you are renouncing
god. You cannot find god anywhere else. God has tc be found here and now
and god has to be found in <em>this</em> and all the religions have been
teaching you about <em>that</em>, the far away, the beyond. They have
all helped man to postpone because the beyond is far away; it is not a
question to be decided today. One can wait --</p><p>tomorrow, perhaps the day after tomorrow, in old age, or maybe after
death or maybe next life -- there is no hurry.</p><p>Hence religiousness became only a formality and churches have become
just like Rotary clubs where a few phony people gather together and
start saying 'Hello. How are you?' and talk about the weather. In the
Rotary club they talk about the weather, in the churches they talk about
god -- but it is the same. Whether it is weather or god makes no
difference.</p><p>They don't mean it; something has to be said, otherwise silence
becomes awkward. And it is just a sunday phenomenon every Sunday you so
to the church. It is prestigious, respectable, and it is good to meet
people, to shake hands and to exchange gossips.</p><p>The reason why it happened that the whole of religion became phony
was that these people were teaching a life-negative attitude. Only
pathological people can</p><p>become interested in something that is against life; hence your
so-called saints are almost psychologically ill, neurotic. The really
healthy people cannot be against list. And the healthy religion can only
be life-affirmative. To me god is synonymous with life. Life is his
dance and he is the dancer. Life is his song and he is the singer. And
if you want to find the singer you have to enter the song, if you want
to find the dancer you have to learn the dance. And you have to
penetrate into the dance -- only then will you be able to find god.</p><p>That's what I mean by surrendering to god: surrender to this
beautiful universe, to its multi-dimensional variety. These are all gods
in different forms, all aspects of god. Live it totally, intensely,
passionately --</p><p>that's what I call surrender to god.</p><p>My sannyasin is not a monk and nun in the old sense; he is a totally
new kind of religious person. He has no past but he has a future and he
has the present. And the monks and the nuns of the Catholics and the
Protestants and the Jainas and the Buddhists have the past but they
don't have any present and no future at all.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=is-the-grass-really-greener...>Is the Grass Really Greener...?</h3><p>Chapter #30 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-4>Osho's books on

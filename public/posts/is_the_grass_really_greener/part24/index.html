It is for reference purposes only.]\nShunyam Renate. Shunyam means zero. Renate means born anew.\nOne can have a new being, a new life, but one has to be ready to get rid of all that is old, to be utterly empty of the old, to be just a zero, nobody, a nothingness. Only out of that nothingness does the new begin.\nThe new is not the modified old, it is discontinuous with the old. So it is not a renovation of the old; the old simply dies without leaving any trace behind. And then the miracle happens the new sprouts up. The grave of the old is the womb for the new.\nAnd sannyas is nothing but a process of emptying you of all that you have been up to now so that you can have a new beginning, a fresh beginning; only then can misery disappear, only then is bliss possible.\nThe story of Jesus being crucified and then after three days resurrecting is beautiful. Christians have not been able to make much use of its symbolisms crucifixion means death and resurrection means birth. But for three days he was neither alive nor dead, for three days he was in a state of being a zero. And those three represent the three stages of the mystics getting rid of the body, getting rid\nof the mind, getting rid of the heart; and then is the rebirth -- the being is discovered.\nIt is through death that one comes to know that which is deathless, the divine. But Christians miss the point for the simple reason that they started emphasising it as a fact. It is not a fact, it is a parable, and parables are far more significant than history. Reducing a parable is very pregnant, a fact is just a flat thing.\nThere is nothing in it, just an event. And we have to understand life itself as a parable, as a prelude to a new life, the divine life.\nSo let sannyas become both a crucifixion and a resurrection.\nSwami Anand Charlie. Anand means bliss. Charlie means of noble spirit.\nMisery is always mean; it cannot be noble. It is the root cause of all that is ugly. One has to drop misery if one wants to be noble -- and it can be dropped because it is our choice. We have chosen it, we are choosing it every day, every moment. Each moment both alternatives, to be miserable or to be blissful, are available for you. But our conditioning is such that we lean towards the miserable. Our conditioning is such that we choose the negative, the darker side. We don't look at the lightning, we look at the dark cloud. We make so much fuss about the dark that we forget all about the beauty of the stars. We become so obsessed with the thorns that the roses are completely forgotten.\nOne has to change this gestalt. Choose the flowers and slowly slowly you will be surprised that the thorns start disappearing. Choose the stars and one day you will find that all darkness is finished. It is a question of choice. And the moment you start choosing the positive, the affirmative, the beautiful, you start leaning towards the blissful, you start becoming noble. A blissful person cannot do anything that is ignoble.\nOut of bliss is all beauty, all grandeur.\nSo I teach my sannyasins to be of cheerful heart, to be blissful. And it is only a question of choosing.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nTry it from this very moment and you will be surprised, it works!\nGautam the Buddha has defined truth as that which works. That's a tremendously beautiful definition. It does not matter whether it is really true or not; the question is whether it works or not -- a very pragmatic definition, a very American definition! (laughter)\nSo try it from this very moment and you will be surprised -- it works. And if it works it is true.\nAnd when I say this I say it from my experience and the experience of thousands of my sannyasins. But I am not telling you to believe it, I am telling you to experiment, to enquire, to go into it. There is no need to believe, because it really works... when you have experienced it then there is no need to believe -- you know it is so.\nPrem David. Prem means love. David means beloved.\nOne who loves naturally becomes a beloved. Gut people try the other way round, they want love tn come first and then they will give. But that is not going to happen because the other person also knows the same arithmetic, both have learned the wrong arithmetic. Both are taught by the same kind of people, the same kind of parents, the same kind of preachers. Their names may be different -\n- Christian, Hindu, Mohammedan -- but the real thing is not very different. They are just different labels but the disease is the same; they are different languages but what they are doing is the same.\nWe have been conditioned in such a way that first we want to yet and then we will give. But that is not the way of nature.\nGive and you will get, and you will get a thousand-fold. Love, love for love's sake. Don't ask for anything in return because it comes inevitably. It is the fundamental law of life that whatsoever you give is bound to bounce back upon you.\nThere are a few things which don't bounce. If you throw a tomato at the wall\n(much laughter) it won't bounce. But love is not a tomato! Love is a real ball -- it bounces! I have tried tomatoes... (The rest of the sentence Osho completes by glancing at the wall on his right and making a throwing gesture.) Only with tomatoes does the law of nature fail.\nLove, and love starts showering on you, raining on you. That's the meaning of David. The ancient meaning is Jehovah's beloved, god's beloved. Mm, god simply means the whole, the whole universe. Love and the whole universe loves you -- and that is the fulfilment.\nVeet Rainer. Veet means surpass, transcend. Rainer means a prudent warrior.\nA sannyasin has to learn to surpass the whole idea of war and the whole idea of being prudent. A sannyasin has to learn love and to be innocent, not prudent. He has to be an innocent lover, not a prudent warrior. Enough of the warriors! The whole of human history has lived according to the idea rooted, oriented, in violence, in war, in fight, and the warrior has been worshipped. But it is time we change the whole idea because warriors are no more needed. Now the world needs lovers; the world no longer needs weapons, it needs flowers. It does not need any prudence, any cunning, any cleverness; it needs innocent people, simple people who can trust even when conditions are not in favour of trusting, who are ready to be cheated but who are not ready to drop their trust.\nThen we can create a new humanity, then we can create a new earth. We can make paradise now and here. Because the whole of human history failed to produce a paradise on earth, they invented, they projected, paradise being somewhere above the clouds. It was simply a failure; but man needs some hope to live by so they projected the idea of paradise somewhere else. It is simply nothing but something to cover up failure.\nMan can create paradise here. And there is no need to wait until after death; if you cannot live in paradise while alive, what is the point of hoping for it after death? When you failed in life you are not going to succeed in death. If you succeed in life, certainly you will succeed in death too, because life and death are continuous. Only the body dies, you remain the same, your consciousness never dies.\nSo there is no need to wait for the future; we should start creating paradise now and here. And if the idea of war disappears, with that will disappear the whole\npolitics of nations, religions, races, colour and all kinds of stupidities. The earth can be one -- it needs to be one.\nIn fact it is one; we have made it divided and we have divided it to create war. We are dividing humanity to fight. We cannot live without fight because fight has become our programme in the mind. For thousands of years we have been programmed for war. It is time for a deprogramming. And that's what sannyas is all about: a deprogramming process. And it leaves you without any programme, free to live 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\naccording to your own light.\nAntar Svargo. Antar means inner. Svargo means paradise.\nJesus says again and again that the kingdom of god is within you -- that's exactly the meaning of your name. There is no need to search for it anywhere else; one just has to dive deep within one's own depth. It is there that the treasure is hidden. And once you have found it your whole life goes through a radical revolution. Once you have known that insight there is inestimable treasure, immeasurable treasure. When you have found the paradise within, of course, your whole character on the outside changes your relationships change, your behaviour changes -- and without any effort. Because your consciousness is not blissful, your actions become blissful. Because now you have all that you always wanted there is such contentment that each breath is such a joy, such a benediction, that you would not harm anybody. You will become a blessing to others too. In fact that's the criterion of a blissful person: if he is really blissful he becomes a blessing to others too.\nBut the whole journey is inward. Going to the moon is not going to help. Going into yourself is the only way to be redeemed from misery, to be liberated from all that we are burdened with. The weight is too much, it is almost a Himalaya, and we are crushed underneath it, we cannot move. Once you have found the source of joy within you, you are free from all weight, you become weightless. And in that weightlessness life is freedom, life is joy, life is a celebration.\nAnand Bhagvato. Anand means bliss. Bhagvato means divine.\nThe only experience worth calling divine is the experience of bliss. All else that can be called divine --\nfor exaMple, love, truth, freedom -- are divine only because they all enhance blissfulness, they all have blissfulness as a basic ingredient, in fact their very centre is blissfulness. So anything that has bliss in it is divine.\nAnd pure bliss is pure godliness. There is no god but there is godliness. There is no deity so all worship is foolish, but there is diviness; hence meditation is meaningful. And that is the difference between prayer and meditation.…\nPrayer starts with the belief that god is a person, and meditation starts with the totally different assumption that god is nothing but a name for the ultimate peak of bliss. So there is no need to pray, there is nobody to pray to, there is nobody to listen to your prayer. It is childish. Meditation is maturity.\nSo now put your whole energy into meditation. Become more silent, more aware. As you become silent, as you become aware, simultaneously you go on becoming more blissful. When awareness is total bliss is also total. Bliss is the by-product of awareness. So grow more in awareness, in watchfulness, in alertness.\nIf one is not watchful one goes around in circles; one goes on repeating the same things as one has been doing one's whole life or maybe for many lives. The moment you become watchful something new enters in your lifes you cannot repeat the same mistakes twice. It is good to make new mistakes because one learns, but it is very stupid to make the same mistake twice; that means one is behaving unconsciously, unmeditatively. And misery is nothing but behaviour rooted in unconsciousness. Bliss is behaviour coming out of consciousness.\nFrom this moment remember blissfulness as the only divine quality so the very idea of prayer disappears; prayer has been an absolute exercise in futility. But millions of people for millions of years have been praying for no purpose at all. If all these people had been meditating we would have created so much consciousness on the earth that the whole earth would have been aglow, aflame. We would have filled it with flowers and songs and dances.\nBut it can still happen!\nPrem Arpano. Prem means love. Arpano means surrender.\nSannyas is a loving surrender to existence. It is dropping the habit of saying no -- which is very deeply engrained. It is replacing no with a big yes, so big that it is bigger than you, so overwhelmingly big that you disappear into it, that it permeates your whole being, every fibre, every cell; it arises from the very roots.\nWhen this yes to existence arises life becomes an ecstasy -- and to me that's the whole of religion. All churches, all temples, all mosques, are just for stupid people; for intelligent people this much is enough of a religion, this single word 'yes'. But it should become your whole life.\nTry with small yeses so that you can have a little bit of experience, a little taste of the joy of saying it.\nThen be courageous and say a little bigger yes. And the ultimate is a single yes into which you disappear 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nand never come out of. That is the merger, the union, the yoga, with the whole. Dhyan Dipo. Dhyan means meditation. Dipo means a small lamp.\nMeditation is a small lamp in the dark light of life. But it is enough, more than enough. It sheds enough light for you to walk a few steps, and by the time you have walked those few steps the light goes ahead of you.\nIn the darkest night with just a small lamp one can travel thousands of miles. Meditation is a small lamp, just a small flame of light inside you, but it is more than enough, more than is needed, and one can pass through all darkness and reach to the dawn.\nI call it a small flame because awareness is exactly a flame. The people who are living without awareness are just dark, black holes. As you start meditating in the beginning you will feel only darkness inside and nothing else. So don't be\ndisturbed by it -- it is natural, because we have never tried to create any light inside. In the beginning it will be dark, but go on watching the darkness. That watching of the darkness is the beginning of the light. That watching is the light. As you watch darkness you become aware you are not it and the first ray of light has entered. Knowing that you are not it, is the first small beginning, but it is tremendously pregnant with possibilities.\nSeeing that there is darkness inside don't turn away. Many people try -- listening to the Buddha, to Jesus, to Socrates, they try to look in but the moment they close their eyes it is all dark. Afraid of darkness they open their eyes; at least on the outside there is some light, some warmth, people are there. Inside you are alone, no warmth, nobody to relate to, and there is immense darkness; it is scary! So many people once in a while try but then they drop the idea; it seems too risky.\nIn the beginning one has to insist, one has to go on entering, undeterred by the darkness. So accept the inner darkness as a challenge and go; go deeper every day. Just remember one key be watchful, then one day suddenly you will see the light has arrived. And it does not come from anywhere else, it arises inside your own being. Watchfulness functions as a catalytic agent.\nAnd when the light grows inside you and fills your whole being, that's what we call Buddhahood, enlightenment -- one has become light itself! And that is the goal of life. without it, without achieving it, one has not really lived, one has only dreamt that one was alive.\nDhyan Pakhi. Dhyan means meditation. Pakhi means a bird.\nMeditation gives you wings. Once you have learned the art of meditation you need not crawl on the earth; you can start ascending into the sky. Then the whole sky is yours. And the higher you rise, the clearer a perspective you have.\nThe meditator has a bird's eye view, he can see things in their total context. He does not see things separately; he sees things interconnected. In his vision all is joined together; it is an organic vision, nothing is separate. And only out of such a vision can life be benefitted.\nThinkers can't help. They are crawling on the earth; they are still tethered to the mind and mind is very earthly. Mind functions according to the law of gravitation, it is being pulled downward. And meditation is a state of no-mind; it\nfunctions in a totally different way. It functions according to the law of levitation, it rises upwards because it is weightless, there is no weight in meditation. Mind is a weighty thing, the more mind you have, the more weight you have.\nHaving no-mind suddenly all wei;ht disappears You have escaped from the prison of gravitation; now you can rise on the wing, as high as you desire. No height is a limitation for you any more, there is no limit any more.\nThis freedom I call sannyas, this total vision I call sannyas. To me sannyas is just a symbol to represent all that is beautiful, all that is true, all that is eternal.\nIs the Grass Really Greener...?

conditioning is such that we lean towards the miserable. Our
conditioning is such that we choose the negative, the darker side. We
don't look at the lightning, we look at the dark cloud. We make so much
fuss about the dark that we forget all about the beauty of the stars. We
become so obsessed with the thorns that the roses are completely
forgotten.</p><p>One has to change this gestalt. Choose the flowers and slowly slowly
you will be surprised that the thorns start disappearing. Choose the
stars and one day you will find that all darkness is finished. It is a
question of choice. And the moment you start choosing the positive, the
affirmative, the beautiful, you start leaning towards the blissful, you
start becoming noble. A blissful person cannot do anything that is
ignoble.</p><p>Out of bliss is all beauty, all grandeur.</p><p>So I teach my sannyasins to be of cheerful heart, to be blissful. And
it is only a question of choosing.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>Try it from this very moment and you will be surprised, it works!</p><p>Gautam the Buddha has defined truth as that which works. That's a
tremendously beautiful definition. It does not matter whether it is
really true or not; the question is whether it works or not -- a very
pragmatic definition, a very American definition! (laughter)</p><p>So try it from this very moment and you will be surprised -- it
works. And if it works it is true.</p><p>And when I say this I say it from my experience and the experience of
thousands of my sannyasins. But I am not telling you to believe it, I am
telling you to experiment, to enquire, to go into it. There is no need
to believe, because it really works... when you have experienced it then
there is no need to believe -- you know it is so.</p><p>Prem David. Prem means love. David means beloved.</p><p>One who loves naturally becomes a beloved. Gut people try the other
way round, they want love tn come first and then they will give. But
that is not going to happen because the other person also knows the same
arithmetic, both have learned the wrong arithmetic. Both are taught by
the same kind of people, the same kind of parents, the same kind of
preachers. Their names may be different -</p><p>- Christian, Hindu, Mohammedan -- but the real thing is not very
different. They are just different labels but the disease is the same;
they are different languages but what they are doing is the same.</p><p>We have been conditioned in such a way that first we want to yet and
then we will give. But that is not the way of nature.</p><p>Give and you will get, and you will get a thousand-fold. Love, love
for love's sake. Don't ask for anything in return because it comes
inevitably. It is the fundamental law of life that whatsoever you give
is bound to bounce back upon you.</p><p>There are a few things which don't bounce. If you throw a tomato at
the wall</p><p>(much laughter) it won't bounce. But love is not a tomato! Love is a
real ball -- it bounces! I have tried tomatoes... (The rest of the
sentence Osho completes by glancing at the wall on his right and making
a throwing gesture.) Only with tomatoes does the law of nature fail.</p><p>Love, and love starts showering on you, raining on you. That's the
meaning of David. The ancient meaning is Jehovah's beloved, god's
beloved. Mm, god simply means the whole, the whole universe. Love and
the whole universe loves you -- and that is the fulfilment.</p><p>Veet Rainer. Veet means surpass, transcend. Rainer means a prudent
warrior.</p><p>A sannyasin has to learn to surpass the whole idea of war and the
whole idea of being prudent. A sannyasin has to learn love and to be
innocent, not prudent. He has to be an innocent lover, not a prudent
warrior. Enough of the warriors! The whole of human history has lived
according to the idea rooted, oriented, in violence, in war, in fight,
and the warrior has been worshipped. But it is time we change the whole
idea because warriors are no more needed. Now the world needs lovers;
the world no longer needs weapons, it needs flowers. It does not need
any prudence, any cunning, any cleverness; it needs innocent people,
simple people who can trust even when conditions are not in favour of
trusting, who are ready to be cheated but who are not ready to drop
their trust.</p><p>Then we can create a new humanity, then we can create a new earth. We
can make paradise now and here. Because the whole of human history
failed to produce a paradise on earth, they invented, they projected,
paradise being somewhere above the clouds. It was simply a failure; but
man needs some hope to live by so they projected the idea of paradise
somewhere else. It is simply nothing but something to cover up
failure.</p><p>Man can create paradise here. And there is no need to wait until
after death; if you cannot live in paradise while alive, what is the
point of hoping for it after death? When you failed in life you are not
going to succeed in death. If you succeed in life, certainly you will
succeed in death too, because life and death are continuous. Only the
body dies, you remain the same, your consciousness never dies.</p><p>So there is no need to wait for the future; we should start creating
paradise now and here. And if the idea of war disappears, with that will
disappear the whole</p><p>politics of nations, religions, races, colour and all kinds of
stupidities. The earth can be one -- it <em>needs</em> to be one.</p><p>In fact it is one; we have made it divided and we have divided it to
create war. We are dividing humanity to fight. We cannot live without
fight because fight has become our programme in the mind. For thousands
of years we have been programmed for war. It is time for a
deprogramming. And that's what sannyas is all about: a deprogramming
process. And it leaves you without any programme, free to live

CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>according to your own light.</p><p>Antar Svargo. Antar means inner. Svargo means paradise.</p><p>Jesus says again and again that the kingdom of god is within you --
that's exactly the meaning of your name. There is no need to search for
it anywhere else; one just has to dive deep within one's own depth. It
is there that the treasure is hidden. And once you have found it your
whole life goes through a radical revolution. Once you have known that
insight there is inestimable treasure, immeasurable treasure. When you
have found the paradise within, of course, your whole character on the
outside changes your relationships change, your behaviour changes -- and
without any effort. Because your consciousness is not blissful, your
actions become blissful. Because now you have all that you always wanted
there is such contentment that each breath is such a joy, such a
benediction, that you would not harm anybody. You will become a blessing
to others too. In fact that's the criterion of a blissful person: if he
is really blissful he becomes a blessing to others too.</p><p>But the whole journey is inward. Going to the moon is not going to
help. Going into yourself is the only way to be redeemed from misery, to
be liberated from all that we are burdened with. The weight is too much,
it is almost a Himalaya, and we are crushed underneath it, we cannot
move. Once you have found the source of joy within you, you are free
from all weight, you become weightless. And in that weightlessness life
is freedom, life is joy, life is a celebration.</p><p>Anand Bhagvato. Anand means bliss. Bhagvato means divine.</p><p>The only experience worth calling divine is the experience of bliss.
All else that can be called divine --</p><p>for exaMple, love, truth, freedom -- are divine only because they all
enhance blissfulness, they all have blissfulness as a basic ingredient,
in fact their very centre is blissfulness. So anything that has bliss in
it is divine.</p><p>And pure bliss is pure godliness. There is no god but there is
godliness. There is no deity so all worship is foolish, but there is
diviness; hence meditation is meaningful. And that is the difference
between prayer and meditation.…</p><p>Prayer starts with the belief that god is a person, and meditation
starts with the totally different assumption that god is nothing but a
name for the ultimate peak of bliss. So there is no need to pray, there
is nobody to pray to, there is nobody to listen to your prayer. It is
childish. Meditation is maturity.</p><p>So now put your whole energy into meditation. Become more silent,
more aware. As you become silent, as you become aware, simultaneously
you go on becoming more blissful. When awareness is total bliss is also
total. Bliss is the by-product of awareness. So grow more in awareness,
in watchfulness, in alertness.</p><p>If one is not watchful one goes around in circles; one goes on
repeating the same things as one has been doing one's whole life or
maybe for many lives. The moment you become watchful something new
enters in your lifes you cannot repeat the same mistakes twice. It is
good to make new mistakes because one learns, but it is very stupid to
make the same mistake twice; that means one is behaving unconsciously,
unmeditatively. And misery is nothing but behaviour rooted in
unconsciousness. Bliss is behaviour coming out of consciousness.</p><p>From this moment remember blissfulness as the only divine quality so
the very idea of prayer disappears; prayer has been an absolute exercise
in futility. But millions of people for millions of years have been
praying for no purpose at all. If all these people had been meditating
we would have created so much consciousness on the earth that the whole
earth would have been aglow, aflame. We would have filled it with
flowers and songs and dances.</p><p>But it can still happen!</p><p>Prem Arpano. Prem means love. Arpano means surrender.</p><p>Sannyas is a loving surrender to existence. It is dropping the habit
of saying no -- which is very deeply engrained. It is replacing no with
a big yes, so big that it is bigger than you, so overwhelmingly big that
you disappear into it, that it permeates your whole being, every fibre,
every cell; it arises from the very roots.</p><p>When this yes to existence arises life becomes an ecstasy -- and to
me that's the whole of religion. All churches, all temples, all mosques,
are just for stupid people; for intelligent people this much is enough
of a religion, this single word 'yes'. But it should become your whole
life.</p><p>Try with small yeses so that you can have a little bit of experience,
a little taste of the joy of saying it.</p><p>Then be courageous and say a little bigger yes. And the ultimate is a
single yes into which you disappear 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on

the whole. Dhyan Dipo. Dhyan means meditation. Dipo means a small
lamp.</p><p>Meditation is a small lamp in the dark light of life. But it is
enough, more than enough. It sheds enough light for you to walk a few
steps, and by the time you have walked those few steps the light goes
ahead of you.</p><p>In the darkest night with just a small lamp one can travel thousands
of miles. Meditation is a small lamp, just a small flame of light inside
you, but it is more than enough, more than is needed, and one can pass
through all darkness and reach to the dawn.</p><p>I call it a small flame because awareness is exactly a flame. The
people who are living without awareness are just dark, black holes. As
you start meditating in the beginning you will feel only darkness inside
and nothing else. So don't be</p><p>disturbed by it -- it is natural, because we have never tried to
create any light inside. In the beginning it will be dark, but go on
watching the darkness. That watching of the darkness is the beginning of
the light. That watching is the light. As you watch darkness you become
aware you are not it and the first ray of light has entered. Knowing
that you are not it, is the first small beginning, but it is
tremendously pregnant with possibilities.</p><p>Seeing that there is darkness inside don't turn away. Many people try
-- listening to the Buddha, to Jesus, to Socrates, they try to look in
but the moment they close their eyes it is all dark. Afraid of darkness
they open their eyes; at least on the outside there is some light, some
warmth, people are there. Inside you are alone, no warmth, nobody to
relate to, and there is immense darkness; it is scary! So many people
once in a while try but then they drop the idea; it seems too risky.</p><p>In the beginning one has to insist, one has to go on entering,
undeterred by the darkness. So accept the inner darkness as a challenge
and go; go deeper every day. Just remember one key be watchful, then one
day suddenly you will see the light has arrived. And it does not come
from anywhere else, it arises inside your own being. Watchfulness
functions as a catalytic agent.</p><p>And when the light grows inside you and fills your whole being,
that's what we call Buddhahood, enlightenment -- one has become light
itself! And that is the goal of life. without it, without achieving it,
one has not really lived, one has only dreamt that one was alive.</p><p>Dhyan Pakhi. Dhyan means meditation. Pakhi means a bird.</p><p>Meditation gives you wings. Once you have learned the art of
meditation you need not crawl on the earth; you can start ascending into
the sky. Then the whole sky is yours. And the higher you rise, the
clearer a perspective you have.</p><p>The meditator has a bird's eye view, he can see things in their total
context. He does not see things separately; he sees things
interconnected. In his vision all is joined together; it is an organic
vision, nothing is separate. And only out of such a vision can life be
benefitted.</p><p>Thinkers can't help. They are crawling on the earth; they are still
tethered to the mind and mind is very earthly. Mind functions according
to the law of gravitation, it is being pulled downward. And meditation
is a state of no-mind; it</p><p>functions in a totally different way. It functions according to the
law of levitation, it rises upwards because it is weightless, there is
no weight in meditation. Mind is a weighty thing, the more mind you
have, the more weight you have.</p><p>Having no-mind suddenly all wei;ht disappears You have escaped from
the prison of gravitation; now you can rise on the wing, as high as you
desire. No height is a limitation for you any more, there is no limit
any more.</p><p>This freedom I call sannyas, this total vision I call sannyas. To me
sannyas is just a symbol to represent all that is beautiful, all that is
true, all that is eternal.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=is-the-grass-really-greener...>Is the Grass Really Greener...?</h3><p>Chapter #26 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on

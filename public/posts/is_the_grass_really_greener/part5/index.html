It is for reference purposes only.]\nAnand means bliss. Trinda means pure, clean, clear.\nThese are the basic qualities of a blissful person. He is pure but not in the moral sense, he is pure in a scientific sense, because there is no misery in him. Misery pollutes the being, it covers your being like clouds. The pure person is one whose being is a sky without clouds.\nIt has nothing to do with morality. Morality itself is a cloud -- maybe a beautiful cloud -- and immorality is an ugly cloud. But a cloud is a cloud. Beautiful or not, it hinders the vision, the light. The sun cannot reach you, the moon cannot reach you. It comes like a wall between you and the stars.\nClean has a second quality. Bliss has the fragrance of the just-opening flower or the just-born baby; it is the same feeling as when you come out of a shower. That cleanliness continuously remains with the blissful person.\nThe miserable person is dirty, he feels the dirt clinging to him. He has never known that the beyond showers continuously. He has never been bathed with the beyond, he has never taken a shower in God; hence he is unclean.\nAnd clear, the third quality. The blissful person can see things as they are. The miserable person always projects his desires. He is so full of desires, so full of frustrations, so full of failures, that his whole life is nothing but wanting, wanting, wanting. He cannot see things as they are, his wants are too many.\nThe blissful person is at ease with himself. He is in a state of non-wanting, he is satisfied. He has got that after which everybody is running and rushing. His perception has no projections in it. And to see things as they are is to see God.\nThe word 'God' is simply a code word. In mystery schools G stands for that, O stands for which, and D\nstands for is. That which is -- that's exactly the meaning of the word 'God'. God is not a word; it is a code word. It has to be decoded, and only a blissful person is capable of decoding it.\nSo my message basically is simple: be blissful, be cheerful. And if you are blissful you are religious.\nAnand means bliss. Alexis means a helper of mankind.\nThe blissful person is inevitably a helper of mankind. And not only of mankind, he is simply a helper of existence itself. And I say it is inevitable -- it is not a question of doing something, it is a by-product of blissfulness. It comes of its own accord because there is a fundamental law of bliss that you have to share it.\nYou cannot escape sharing it. That is intrinsic to bliss, its organic quality -- inalienable, inseparable.\nJust as when light comes darkness cannot exist, when bliss happens you cannot cause misery to anybody, not even in your dreams. That simply disappears. And when you cannot cause misery you are so full of bliss -- it is overflowing. You have to share it, otherwise it becomes a burden. There is a pain if you don't share bliss, the same pain as the cloud feels when it is full of rain and cannot shower. It has to shower to unburden. It is the same pain as a woman feels when the child is ready in her womb. Nine months are over and the child has to be given birth to. Now it is becoming heavier, it is impossible to contain the child anymore.\nGiving birth to a child simply means sharing the child with the world, sending him into the world. The same is true about bliss: when you have it, it comes in\nsuch abundance, floodlike, that it starts overglowing you. And the beauty is the more you share it, the more you have it.\nOnce you have learned this strange law that sharing makes it deeper, greater, then it is simple logic to go on giving it for no other reason but just for the sake of giving. And you don't feel that others have to be 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nobliged to you. In fact, the blissful person is obliged to those who allow him to shower his bliss upon them.\nThat's the whole philosophy of sannyas: be blissful and let it flow from you in every direction. Never bother about who deserves it and who does not; you are not the judge. And there is no need to judge, your joy should be in sharing.\nSo give without any conditions. Just give, not as a duty but as love. You are not doing anything to anybody, you are not doing anything special. You are not a public servant, a social reformer and all that nonsense, you are not a missionary. To be a missionary is to be ugly, because the whole idea is that you are doing something great, something holy.\nMy sannyasins are not holy people in that sense. My sannyasins have to be very ordinary, because, this is my observation, to be just ordinary is the most extraordinary phenomenon in existence because everybody wants to be extraordinary. Hence the desire for extraordinariness is very ordinary. Who wants to be ordinary? -- only a very extraordinary person.\nAnand means bliss. Harry means home.\nLife in every form is searching for a home, it is searching for its source. That's why animals, birds, trees, man -- all kinds of life forms are one as far as the longing for bliss is concerned, because bliss is the home.\nThere are many houses, but a house is not equivalent to a home. A house is just an overnightls stay; tho home is eternal. Once you have arrived, there is no need\nto go anywhere, all is fulfilled, the journey is completed. And the joy of completing a great job, of finishing something that has been incomplete for thousands of lives!\nBliss is the only real longing of man. So I don't insist on your believing in god because that will be a belief, and all beliefs are plastic, artificial, arbitrary; my insistence is on the natural. So whether one is an atheist or a theist, it doesn't matters bliss is the longing of allO Hence I call bliss the home. It is the source and it is the end, the beginning and the end, the alpha and the omega.\nWe have come from some unknown source and we are searching for a way back to it. The circle will be complete when we have found it. And the moment we find it -- immediately the recognition that this is the origin and this is the goal, and they are not separate.\nVeet Seraida.\nSeraida is a dangerous name, hence I have to put a condition before it; Veet means go beyond -- go beyond Seraida. Seraida means one who is burning with a religious desire, one who is ardently religious.\nThat is a very dangerous thing, that creates fanaticism. Ardently religious people have been a calamity in the world.\nI want you to be simply religious; not ardently, not seriously, not fanatically. There is no question of burning with religiousness. Flower -- that's right. Rejoice, dance, sing, but don't burn! Because when a person starts burning with religiousness then he wants everybody to burn with the same religiousness. That's how Christianity, Mohammedanism, Hinduism, Judaism, has been functioning for thousands of years. The earth has been dominated by the fanatics, and religion is not fanaticism.\nOne should be very light-hearted, don't take religion seriously. Take it as fun -- it is the ultimate fun, but fun all the same.\nThe eastern mystics have called the world god's 'leela', his play -- that is far more beautiful. That idea is missing in all the Judaic religions. Christianity, Mohammedanism -- these are Judaic religions, by-products of Judaism. They are completely missing the whole dimension of festivity and light-heartedness; they have been too serious, deadly serious. That's the meaning of ardently religious.\nOf course in the past it has been thought to be a great quality, hence the name Seraida became very significant. But with me you will have to unlearn it. To me existence is a cosmic joke. God is playing hide and seek. We know where he is hiding, he knows that we know but just to continue the game.…\nI can show you where he is hiding but then the whole game is finished. If you read the punchline of a joke first then what is the point of reading the joke? -- all is finished. So the punchline remains hanging like a carrot ahead of you; you go on moving and the carrot goes on moving; it is always there on the horizon. It is very close, it is not very far away, but you never reach it.\nThat's the whole joy of life! That's the beauty of life, that it remains a mystery. And it is not that we cannot dissect it, it can be dissected but only a fool will do that and a fool cannot do that. A wise man can do it but a wise man will not do it. Do you get it?\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nDhyan means meditation. Thomas means a seeker of truth.\nThere are two ways to seek the truth: one is mind, the other is meditation. If you choose the mind you land in the world of philosophy. Then there are thousands of questions but no answers. Many times you will feel you are coming closer to an answer, but when you arrive you will find ten more questions hiding behind it.\nIn philosophy answers are only hiding places for many more questions. So each answer creates ten questions. And as philosophy has grown bigger and bigger... now it is nothing but questions and questions and no answer at all. It can drive a man crazy -- in fact it does. It is very difficult to find a philosopher who is not crazy. If he is not crazy he is not much of a philosopher, he is wasting his time -- that is not his business. A philosopher has to be crazy; otherwise, who wants questions and questions? And to be surrounded by all kinds of questions... finally one gets lost in the jungle of philosophy.\nIf you go through meditation, which is just the opposite of mind -- meditation means no-mind -- then you enter the world of religion. Just as in the world of mind there are only questions, in the world of meditation there are only answers, no questions. Hence a person moving into meditation becomes more and more silent, more and more sane. The name of ultimate sanity is buddhahood -- that's what we call wisdom.\nThen there are no questions left anymore.\nAnd because there are no questions anymore, you cannot say you have got the answers either -- because they are relevant only with the questions. One is simply silent.\nThe philosopher is in a turmoil, the mystic is absolutely silent. The philosopher tries hard but finds nothing, the mystic does not try at all and finds everything. The mystic says: sitting silently, doing nothing, spring comes and the grass grows by itself.\nThe West has not been able to understand the mystic; the mystic seems to be very alien to the Western mind. Just sitting silently, doing nothing, not even thinking? Then why are you sitting? For what?\nThe Western approach is a mind approach. It is dominated by philosophy. Because of that domination it cannot think that there is a possibility of just being and doing nothing -- no questions, no problems, no thoughts; relaxing in oneself, resting in oneself. And in that rest one arrives, one arrives at one's own innermost core. And that is where one finds the truth. There is nowhere else one can find the truth.\nThe philosopher goes everywhere, the mystic simply sits in his own home. Lao Tzu says that you need not even go out of the room; all that you want you can find inside. And he is right!\nBeing initiated into sannyas means being initiated into meditation. So now learn to drop the mind. Pull the energy out from the mind and put it into meditativeness, into silence.\nI don't give any answers, I only destroy your questions. I call that answering -- destroying your questions. When all your questions are destroyed, nothing is left in you, all is found.\nIn nothing all is found.\nAnand means bliss. Marlies consists of two words; the first part means rebellion and the second part means victory.\nBliss is a rebellion and also a victory. It is a rebellion against the stupid society in which we are brought up, against the dull and dead tradition that has been imposed upon us. All kinds of ideologies, philosophies, theologies, have been forced on every person. One has to rebel against all that because those are the things which are keeping you tethered to your misery. Unless you uproot all that has been imposed on you by others, you will never be blissful.\nThe society lives in misery and this society goes on conditioning every child. The parents are miserable, the teachers are miserable, the neighbours are miserable, the priests are miserable; the politicians are miserable -- and they are all together, imposing what is right, what is wrong, what you have to do and what you haven't to do. And of course they create just replicas of themselves. They create every child in their own image -- and they are miserable people. So many miserable people working hard on a small child are bound to destroy all his intrinsic blissfulness. Bliss is intrinsic and natural but it can be destroyed, at least it can be covered with rubbish; you can be made to forget all about it. And that's what they have done.\nA rebellion is needed. And unless one is ready to rebel, one cannot be a sannyasin. Rebel against all that creates misery in you and you will be surprised to know that you will have to rebel agalnst the whole mind that up to now you thought was yours; it is your enemy, not your friend.\nAnd if one is ready to rebel against the mind, bliss explodes and brings victory. The only victory which can be really called victory is not the victory over somebody else but the victory over your own innermost self, the victory which makes you capable of entering into the kingdom of god.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThe most important thing in life is to discover your truth. Certainly it is there becauso we are alive, we are conscious. We have to dig into our consciousness, we have to go to the very source of it, to the very rock-bottom. And once you have found it, you have found your truth. Once you know who you are -- that's what I mean by your truth' -- you are liberated. You will live in the same way, nothing on the outside will change, but still you will be a totally different person. In one sense everything will be the same, in another sense nothing will be the same any more, because now you will have a perspective which is timeless, deathless. Now you know that you were before birth and you will be after death. Now that you have seen your original faco you are freed from all small things -- life's failures and successes, richness and poverty, small pains and pleasures. They all look so small, so insignificant, that one can remain absolutely centred in every kind of situation. Nothing makes you waver, your groundedness is so solid, your centredness is so absolute.\nThis centredness is the goal of sannyas. This groundedness, this integrity, this unwavering state of consciousness which remains untouched by everything, this is the goal of sannyas. And once this is discovered there is nothing more to discover. Then one can livo the ordinary life with an extraordinary beauty, with an extraordinary bliss, with grace, with god within one's heart.\nToshi means absolutely contented.\nMind is discontentment, it is never contented. It goes on saying 'Get this, get that, and I will be contented,' but by the time you get it, it is again asking for something else. And the game continues for the whole of one's life from the cradle to the grave. It goes on asking for more.\nIt is said that when Alexander the Great saw Diogenes, a Greek mystic, Diogenes said to him 'I have heard that you are going to conquer the whole world, but have you pondered over one question?' Alexander said 'What question?' Diogenes said 'A simple question, that you must consider before you enter on this enterprlses remember there is only one world and if you conquer it then what will you do afterwards?'\nThe story is that just the idea made Alexander sad; just the idea that if he conquered the whole world of course the problem would arise of, now what? With just the idea -- he had not yet conquered the world -- his mind immediately became discontented and asked for another world, another toy. That's the way of\nthe mind; it goes from one discontentment to another.\nBut there is something more than mind in you; and that is the only hope. There is something deeper than the mind in you: your consciousness. Consciousness is not part of the mind, because you can even watch your mind, so the watcher is separate from the mind, different from the mind. And this watcher has a totally different quality, just the opposite to the mind -- the quality of contentment, absolute contentment.\nEach moment is so full of joy, so exquisitely joyful, that even if death comes right now you will not ask for another moment because this moment was enough. There is no question of asking for another world; even for another moment you will not say to death 'Wait, because I have to finish a few things, because there are a few things which I was doing and they are incomplete. You will say I' am ready.'\nContentment means 'This moment is enough. Right now all that I need is here; all that I have ever needed and will ever need is here.' And to be in such a state is to know god, is to be god. Then each moment is a dance and a celebration. Then each moment has such infinite depth and so much treasure, that who cares whether tomorrow comes or not? Who bothers?\nIn his prayer at night before he went to bed, one Sufi mystic, Farid, used to say 'Thank you, god.' And in the morning again when he opened his eyes, the same prayers 'Thank you, god.' His disciples were a little puzzled because this was not the Mohammedan way. They have specific prayers; a Mohammedan has to do five kinds of prayer five times a day. What kind of prayer was this? He did it only twice! and 'Thank you, god...'?\nThey said to him 'Please, don't be offended -- we are your disciples and we should not ask any questions like this, this is your personal matter -- but we have become very curious: why do you say \"thank you\" when you go to sleep and again in the morning?' He said 'I say thank you because who knows? -- this may be my last moment and in the morning I may not wake up, so at least before I leave the world -- he has given so much to me -- I should say thank you. In the morning when I wake up I am so full of wonder, I cannot believe my own eyes that I am here again and the day is here -- so it seems I have one day more! So much is available -- the sun and the birds singing and the flowers and the fragrance -- so I say thank you. I had never asked, I never thought that there\nwould be another day but thore is. It is just a gift from god, so I say thank you. More than that I don't know,' he said, 'More prayer is not needed.'\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nPrayer is a thankfulness; in fact a contented being is continuously prayerful. Whether he says anything or not there is always a deep undercurrent of thankfulness. That has to become your life.\nI am giving you a very small name -- Toshi -- but it contains the whole of religions.\n-- How long will you be here?\n-- (Her reply is very softly spoken.)\n-- Be here as long as possible -- and as long as god allows! Anudeva means divine, godly.\nWe are gods. If we know that, we live an ecstatic life; if we don't know, we live in agony. The only difference is of knowing; there is no qualitative difference between you and Christ, except just a very simple difference that he knows who he is and you are unaware of the fact. He has the treasure, you have the treasure; it is the same treasure, but you are unconscious of it and he is conscious of it. So all that is needed is a little bit of awareness, just a little candle of awareness and the miracle happens.\nMeditation is that little bit of awareness. It is only a seed but the seed soon becomes a big tree with great foliage and flowers and fruits.\nNow, let meditation become the very focus of your life, the very centre. Everything else should be secondary and everything else should be arranged in such a way that it helps your meditation and does not hinder it. Anything that\nhinders your meditation has to be dropped and anything that helps it has to be practised. Meditation has to be the criterion.

Chuang Tzu Auditorium</h3><p>Archive code: 8012055 ShortTitle: GREENR05 Audio:</p><p>No Video:</p><p>No</p><p>[NOTE: This is an unedited tape transcript of an unpublished darshan
diary, which has been scanned and cleaned up. It is for reference
purposes only.]</p><p>Anand means bliss. Trinda means pure, clean, clear.</p><p>These are the basic qualities of a blissful person. He is pure but
not in the moral sense, he is pure in a scientific sense, because there
is no misery in him. Misery pollutes the being, it covers your being
like clouds. The pure person is one whose being is a sky without
clouds.</p><p>It has nothing to do with morality. Morality itself is a cloud --
maybe a beautiful cloud -- and immorality is an ugly cloud. But a cloud
is a cloud. Beautiful or not, it hinders the vision, the light. The sun
cannot reach you, the moon cannot reach you. It comes like a wall
between you and the stars.</p><p>Clean has a second quality. Bliss has the fragrance of the
just-opening flower or the just-born baby; it is the same feeling as
when you come out of a shower. That cleanliness continuously remains
with the blissful person.</p><p>The miserable person is dirty, he feels the dirt clinging to him. He
has never known that the beyond showers continuously. He has never been
bathed with the beyond, he has never taken a shower in God; hence he is
unclean.</p><p>And clear, the third quality. The blissful person can see things as
they are. The miserable person always projects his desires. He is so
full of desires, so full of frustrations, so full of failures, that his
whole life is nothing but wanting, wanting, wanting. He cannot see
things as they are, his wants are too many.</p><p>The blissful person is at ease with himself. He is in a state of
non-wanting, he is satisfied. He has got that after which everybody is
running and rushing. His perception has no projections in it. And to see
things as they are is to see God.</p><p>The word 'God' is simply a code word. In mystery schools G stands for
<em>that</em>, O stands for <em>which</em>, and D</p><p>stands for <em>is</em>. <em>That which is</em> -- that's exactly the
meaning of the word 'God'. God is not a word; it is a code word. It has
to be decoded, and only a blissful person is capable of decoding it.</p><p>So my message basically is simple: be blissful, be cheerful. And if
you are blissful you are religious.</p><p>Anand means bliss. Alexis means a helper of mankind.</p><p>The blissful person is inevitably a helper of mankind. And not only
of mankind, he is simply a helper of existence itself. And I say it is
inevitable -- it is not a question of <em>doing</em> something, it is a
by-product of blissfulness. It comes of its own accord because there is
a fundamental law of bliss that you have to share it.</p><p>You cannot escape sharing it. That is intrinsic to bliss, its organic
quality -- inalienable, inseparable.</p><p>Just as when light comes darkness cannot exist, when bliss happens
you cannot cause misery to anybody, not even in your dreams. That simply
disappears. And when you cannot cause misery you are so full of bliss --
it is overflowing. You have to share it, otherwise it becomes a burden.
There is a pain if you don't share bliss, the same pain as the cloud
feels when it is full of rain and cannot shower. It has to shower to
unburden. It is the same pain as a woman feels when the child is ready
in her womb. Nine months are over and the child has to be given birth
to. Now it is becoming heavier, it is impossible to contain the child
anymore.</p><p>Giving birth to a child simply means sharing the child with the
world, sending him into the world. The same is true about bliss: when
you have it, it comes in</p><p>such abundance, floodlike, that it starts overglowing you. And the
beauty is the more you share it, the more you have it.</p><p>Once you have learned this strange law that sharing makes it deeper,
greater, then it is simple logic to go on giving it for no other reason
but just for the sake of giving. And you don't feel that others have to
be 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished>Osho's books on

allow him to shower his bliss upon them.</p><p>That's the whole philosophy of sannyas: be blissful and let it flow
from you in every direction. Never bother about who deserves it and who
does not; you are not the judge. And there is no need to judge, your joy
should be in sharing.</p><p>So give without any conditions. Just give, not as a duty but as love.
You are not doing anything to anybody, you are not doing anything
special. You are not a public servant, a social reformer and all that
nonsense, you are not a missionary. To be a missionary is to be ugly,
because the whole idea is that you are doing something great, something
holy.</p><p>My sannyasins are not holy people in that sense. My sannyasins have
to be very ordinary, because, this is my observation, to be just
ordinary is the most extraordinary phenomenon in existence because
everybody wants to be extraordinary. Hence the desire for
extraordinariness is very ordinary. Who wants to be ordinary? -- only a
very extraordinary person.</p><p>Anand means bliss. Harry means home.</p><p>Life in every form is searching for a home, it is searching for its
source. That's why animals, birds, trees, man -- all kinds of life forms
are one as far as the longing for bliss is concerned, because bliss is
the home.</p><p>There are many houses, but a house is not equivalent to a home. A
house is just an overnightls stay; tho home is eternal. Once you have
arrived, there is no need</p><p>to go anywhere, all is fulfilled, the journey is completed. And the
joy of completing a great job, of finishing something that has been
incomplete for thousands of lives!</p><p>Bliss is the only real longing of man. So I don't insist on your
believing in god because that will be a belief, and all beliefs are
plastic, artificial, arbitrary; my insistence is on the natural. So
whether one is an atheist or a theist, it doesn't matters bliss is the
longing of allO Hence I call bliss the home. It is the source and it is
the end, the beginning and the end, the alpha and the omega.</p><p>We have come from some unknown source and we are searching for a way
back to it. The circle will be complete when we have found it. And the
moment we find it -- immediately the recognition that this is the origin
and this is the goal, and they are not separate.</p><p>Veet Seraida.</p><p>Seraida is a dangerous name, hence I have to put a condition before
it; Veet means go beyond -- go beyond Seraida. Seraida means one who is
burning with a religious desire, one who is ardently religious.</p><p>That is a very dangerous thing, that creates fanaticism. Ardently
religious people have been a calamity in the world.</p><p>I want you to be simply religious; not ardently, not seriously, not
fanatically. There is no question of burning with religiousness. Flower
-- that's right. Rejoice, dance, sing, but don't burn! Because when a
person starts burning with religiousness then he wants everybody to burn
with the same religiousness. That's how Christianity, Mohammedanism,
Hinduism, Judaism, has been functioning for thousands of years. The
earth has been dominated by the fanatics, and religion is not
fanaticism.</p><p>One should be very light-hearted, don't take religion seriously. Take
it as fun -- it is the ultimate fun, but fun all the same.</p><p>The eastern mystics have called the world god's 'leela', his play --
that is far more beautiful. That idea is missing in all the Judaic
religions. Christianity, Mohammedanism -- these are Judaic religions,
by-products of Judaism. They are completely missing the whole dimension
of festivity and light-heartedness; they have been too serious, deadly
serious. That's the meaning of ardently religious.</p><p>Of course in the past it has been thought to be a great quality,
hence the name Seraida became very significant. But with me you will
have to unlearn it. To me existence is a cosmic joke. God is playing
hide and seek. We know where he is hiding, he knows that we know but
just to continue the game.…</p><p>I can show you where he is hiding but then the whole game is
finished. If you read the punchline of a joke first then what is the
point of reading the joke? -- all is finished. So the punchline remains
hanging like a carrot ahead of you; you go on moving and the carrot goes
on moving; it is always there on the horizon. It is very close, it is
not very far away, but you never reach it.</p><p>That's the whole joy of life! That's the beauty of life, that it
remains a mystery. And it is not that we cannot dissect it, it can be
dissected but only a fool will do that and a fool <em>cannot</em> do
that. A wise man can do it but a wise man will not do it. Do you get
it?</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>Dhyan means meditation. Thomas means a seeker of truth.</p><p>There are two ways to seek the truth: one is mind, the other is
meditation. If you choose the mind you land in the world of philosophy.
Then there are thousands of questions but no answers. Many times you
will feel you are coming closer to an answer, but when you arrive you
will find ten more questions hiding behind it.</p><p>In philosophy answers are only hiding places for many more questions.
So each answer creates ten questions. And as philosophy has grown bigger
and bigger... now it is nothing but questions and questions and no
answer at all. It can drive a man crazy -- in fact it does. It is very
difficult to find a philosopher who is not crazy. If he is not crazy he
is not much of a philosopher, he is wasting his time -- that is not his
business. A philosopher has to be crazy; otherwise, who wants questions
and questions? And to be surrounded by all kinds of questions... finally
one gets lost in the jungle of philosophy.</p><p>If you go through meditation, which is just the opposite of mind --
meditation means no-mind -- then you enter the world of religion. Just
as in the world of mind there are only questions, in the world of
meditation there are only answers, no questions. Hence a person moving
into meditation becomes more and more silent, more and more sane. The
name of ultimate sanity is buddhahood -- that's what we call wisdom.</p><p>Then there are no questions left anymore.</p><p>And because there are no questions anymore, you cannot say you have
got the answers either -- because they are relevant only with the
questions. One is simply silent.</p><p>The philosopher is in a turmoil, the mystic is absolutely silent. The
philosopher tries hard but finds nothing, the mystic does not try at all
and finds everything. The mystic says: sitting silently, doing nothing,
spring comes and the grass grows by itself.</p><p>The West has not been able to understand the mystic; the mystic seems
to be very alien to the Western mind. Just sitting silently, doing
nothing, not even thinking? Then why are you sitting? For what?</p><p>The Western approach is a mind approach. It is dominated by
philosophy. Because of that domination it cannot think that there is a
possibility of just being and doing nothing -- no questions, no
problems, no thoughts; relaxing in oneself, resting in oneself. And in
that rest one arrives, one arrives at one's own innermost core. And that
is where one finds the truth. There is nowhere else one can find the
truth.</p><p>The philosopher goes everywhere, the mystic simply sits in his own
home. Lao Tzu says that you need not even go out of the room; all that
you want you can find inside. And he is right!</p><p>Being initiated into sannyas means being initiated into meditation.
So now learn to drop the mind. Pull the energy out from the mind and put
it into meditativeness, into silence.</p><p>I don't give any answers, I only destroy your questions. I call that
answering -- destroying your questions. When all your questions are
destroyed, nothing is left in you, all is found.</p><p>In nothing all is found.</p><p>Anand means bliss. Marlies consists of two words; the first part
means rebellion and the second part means victory.</p><p>Bliss is a rebellion and also a victory. It is a rebellion against
the stupid society in which we are brought up, against the dull and dead
tradition that has been imposed upon us. All kinds of ideologies,
philosophies, theologies, have been forced on every person. One has to
rebel against all that because those are the things which are keeping
you tethered to your misery. Unless you uproot all that has been imposed
on you by others, you will never be blissful.</p><p>The society lives in misery and this society goes on conditioning
every child. The parents are miserable, the teachers are miserable, the
neighbours are miserable, the priests are miserable; the politicians are
miserable -- and they are all together, imposing what is right, what is
wrong, what you have to do and what you haven't to do. And of course
they create just replicas of themselves. They create every child in
their own image -- and they are miserable people. So many miserable
people working hard on a small child are bound to destroy all his
intrinsic blissfulness. Bliss is intrinsic and natural but it can be
destroyed, at least it can be covered with rubbish; you can be made to
forget all about it. And that's what they have done.</p><p>A rebellion is needed. And unless one is ready to rebel, one cannot
be a sannyasin. Rebel against all that creates misery in you and you
will be surprised to know that you will have to rebel agalnst the whole
mind that up to now you thought was yours; it is your enemy, not your
friend.</p><p>And if one is ready to rebel against the mind, bliss explodes and
brings victory. The only victory which can be really called victory is
not the victory over somebody else but the victory over your own
innermost self, the victory which makes you capable of entering into the
kingdom of god.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>The most important thing in life is to discover your truth. Certainly
it is there becauso we are alive, we are conscious. We have to dig into
our consciousness, we have to go to the very source of it, to the very
rock-bottom. And once you have found it, you have found your truth. Once
you know who you are -- that's what I mean by your truth' -- you are
liberated. You will live in the same way, nothing on the outside will
change, but still you will be a totally different person. In one sense
everything will be the same, in another sense nothing will be the same
any more, because now you will have a perspective which is timeless,
deathless. Now you know that you were before birth and you will be after
death. Now that you have seen your original faco you are freed from all
small things -- life's failures and successes, richness and poverty,
small pains and pleasures. They all look so small, so insignificant,
that one can remain absolutely centred in every kind of situation.
Nothing makes you waver, your groundedness is so solid, your centredness
is so absolute.</p><p>This centredness is the goal of sannyas. This groundedness, this
integrity, this unwavering state of consciousness which remains
untouched by everything, this is the goal of sannyas. And once this is
discovered there is nothing more to discover. Then one can livo the
ordinary life with an extraordinary beauty, with an extraordinary bliss,
with grace, with god within one's heart.</p><p>Toshi means absolutely contented.</p><p>Mind is discontentment, it is never contented. It goes on saying 'Get
this, get that, and I will be contented,' but by the time you get it, it
is again asking for something else. And the game continues for the whole
of one's life from the cradle to the grave. It goes on asking for
more.</p><p>It is said that when Alexander the Great saw Diogenes, a Greek
mystic, Diogenes said to him 'I have heard that you are going to conquer
the whole world, but have you pondered over one question?' Alexander
said 'What question?' Diogenes said 'A simple question, that you must
consider before you enter on this enterprlses remember there is only one
world and if you conquer it then what will you do afterwards?'</p><p>The story is that just the idea made Alexander sad; just the idea
that if he conquered the whole world of course the problem would arise
of, now what? With just the idea -- he had not yet conquered the world
-- his mind immediately became discontented and asked for another world,
another toy. That's the way of</p><p>the mind; it goes from one discontentment to another.</p><p>But there is something more than mind in you; and that is the only
hope. There is something deeper than the mind in you: your
consciousness. Consciousness is not part of the mind, because you can
even watch your mind, so the watcher is separate from the mind,
different from the mind. And this watcher has a totally different
quality, just the opposite to the mind -- the quality of contentment,
absolute contentment.</p><p>Each moment is so full of joy, so exquisitely joyful, that even if
death comes right now you will not ask for another moment because this
moment was enough. There is no question of asking for another world;
even for another moment you will not say to death 'Wait, because I have
to finish a few things, because there are a few things which I was doing
and they are incomplete. You will say I' am ready.'</p><p>Contentment means 'This moment is enough. Right now all that I need
is here; all that I have ever needed and will ever need is here.' And to
be in such a state is to know god, is to <em>be</em> god. Then each
moment is a dance and a celebration. Then each moment has such infinite
depth and so much treasure, that who cares whether tomorrow comes or
not? Who bothers?</p><p>In his prayer at night before he went to bed, one Sufi mystic, Farid,
used to say 'Thank you, god.' And in the morning again when he opened
his eyes, the same prayers 'Thank you, god.' His disciples were a little
puzzled because this was not the Mohammedan way. They have specific
prayers; a Mohammedan has to do five kinds of prayer five times a day.
What kind of prayer was this? He did it only twice! and 'Thank you,
god...'?</p><p>They said to him 'Please, don't be offended -- we are your disciples
and we should not ask any questions like this, this is your personal
matter -- but we have become very curious: why do you say "thank you"
when you go to sleep and again in the morning?' He said 'I say thank you
because who knows? -- this may be my last moment and in the morning I
may not wake up, so at least before I leave the world -- he has given so
much to me -- I should say thank you. In the morning when I wake up I am
so full of wonder, I cannot believe my own eyes that I am here again and
the day is here -- so it seems I have one day more! So much is available
-- the sun and the birds singing and the flowers and the fragrance -- so
I say thank you. I had never asked, I never thought that there</p><p>would be another day but thore is. It is just a gift from god, so I
say thank you. More than that I don't know,' he said, 'More prayer is
not needed.'</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>Prayer is a thankfulness; in fact a contented being is continuously
prayerful. Whether he says anything or not there is always a deep
undercurrent of thankfulness. That has to become your life.</p><p>I am giving you a very small name -- Toshi -- but it contains the
whole of religions.</p><p>-- How long will you be here?</p><p>-- (Her reply is very softly spoken.)</p><p>-- Be here as long as possible -- and as long as god allows! Anudeva
means divine, godly.</p><p>We are gods. If we know that, we live an ecstatic life; if we don't
know, we live in agony. The only difference is of knowing; there is no
qualitative difference between you and Christ, except just a very simple
difference that he knows who he is and you are unaware of the fact. He
has the treasure, you have the treasure; it is the same treasure, but
you are unconscious of it and he is conscious of it. So all that is
needed is a little bit of awareness, just a little candle of awareness
and the miracle happens.</p><p>Meditation is that little bit of awareness. It is only a seed but the
seed soon becomes a big tree with great foliage and flowers and
fruits.</p><p>Now, let meditation become the very focus of your life, the very
centre. Everything else should be secondary and everything else should
be arranged in such a way that it helps your meditation and does not
hinder it. Anything that</p><p>hinders your meditation has to be dropped and anything that helps it
has to be practised. Meditation has to be the criterion. And it is such
a great criterion that you can easily dissect the non-essential from thc
essential; the essential is always nourishing to meditation and the
non-essential is always poisoning.</p><p>The sannyasin lives the essential life, and the non-essential slowly
slowly disappears, evaporates.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:justify id=is-the-grass-really-greener...>Is the Grass Really Greener...?</h3><p>Chapter #6</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part4>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

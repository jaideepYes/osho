SUSUPTA-STHANA EKI-BHUTAH\nPRAJNANA-GHANA, EVANANDAMAYO, HYANANDA-BHUK, CETO MUKHAH PRAJNAS TRTIYAH PADAH.\nESA SARVESVARA, ESA SARVAJNA ESONTAR-YAMYESA YONIH SARVASYA, PRABHAVAPYAYA\nHI BHUTANAM.\nTHIS PURE SELF HAS FOUR QUARTERS: THE FIRST IS THE WAKING STATE,\nEXPERIENCE OF THE REALITY COMMON TO EVERYONE. THE ATTENTION FACES OUTWARDS,\nENJOYING THE WORLD IN ALL ITS VARIETY.\nTHE SECOND IS EXPERIENCE OF SUBJECTIVE WORLDS, SUCH AS IN DREAMING.\nHERE THE ATTENTION DWELLS WITHIN, CHARMED BY THE MIND’S SUBTLER CREATIONS. THE THIRD IS DEEP SLEEP,\nTHE MIND RESTS, WITH AWARENESS SUSPENDED. THIS STATE BEYOND DUALITY,\n– FROM WHICH THE WVES OF THINKING EMERGE,\nIS ENJOYED BY THE ENLIGHTENED AS AN OCEAN OF SILENCE AND BLISS.\nTHE FOURTH, SAY THE WISE, IS THE PURE SELF ALONE. DWELLING IN THE HEART OF ALL,\nIT IS THE LORD OF ALL, THE SEER OF ALL,\nTHE SOURCE AND GOAL OF ALL.\nCARL GUSTAV JUNG thinks that the Eastern approach to reality is introvert – he is utterly wrong. The Eastern approach is neither extrovert nor introvert; it is a transcendence of both. But to understand the transcendence one has to be a Buddha, one has to be really awakened.\nThe ordinary mind can think only of two things: the outside reality and the inside reality. There is no possibility of comprehending the beyond, and the beyond is the concern of all Eastern mysticism.\nThe Upanishads are the source of all that is beautiful, true, blissful, all that is significant as far as human evolution is concerned.\nOne of my friends, a great poet, Ramdhari Singh Dinkar went to China. He was talking to a great Chinese philosopher, Lin Yu-Tang. Ramdhari had heard much from me about Lao Tzu; he had become immensely interested in the Taoist approach to reality. He said to Lin Yu-Tang, “I love Lao Tzu.” Lin Yu-Tang looked at the poet, puzzled, and said, “But the source of Lao Tzu is in the Upanishads!”\nAnd Lin Yu-Tang is right, sincerely right: the whole mysticism of the East, wherever it has happened – in India, in China, in Japan – has its source in the Upanishads. And this Upanishad, the Mandukya Upanishad, is one of the most fundamental, because in a very essential way it describes the innermost core and also the ultimate reach of human consciousness\nThe ordinary mind is dual; it thinks in terms of twoness: light and dark, day and night, summer and winter, life and death, good and bad, moral and immoral, extrovert and introvert, the real and the unreal, the momentary and the permanent. The duality is always there; it has entered into the very fabric of our languages.\nBut the moment you become really awakened... and remember the word ‘really’, because we think that every morning we are awake when we come out of sleep. That is only pseudo awakening, that is only so-called awakening. The real awakening is when one becomes a Jesus, a Buddha, a Mahavira, a Lao Tzu. When one has come to see the merger of the within and the without, when one has come to see the oneness of life and death, when there is no division left, that state is awakening. Before that everybody is a little bit schizophrenic because the divided mind divides you. Then you are divided into the lower and the higher, then you are divided into the conscious and the unconscious, the body and the soul, and so on and so forth.\nCarl Gustav Jung is not right at all in saying that Eastern mysticism is introvert. That is a condemnation, because in psychology the word’introversion’ is ugly. It means somebody is morbid, it means somebody is closed to the outside reality, it means that one is not open.\nJung had come to India while a great seer was alive, Sri Ramana Maharshi, and many people told him to go and see him – but he didn’t go there. He traveled all over India, he went to see the Taj\nMahal and Khajuraho Ajanta and Ellora, but he didn’t go to see Ramana Maharshi. Basically he was afraid. The fear was that a man like Ramana can become a mirror; he might see his own face, his own falseness.\nBut people rationalize everything. He rationalized that he didn’t go to see Ramana because the Western mind is extrovert and the Eastern mind is introvert, their approaches are different and it is better not to get them mixed, otherwise one can lose one’s path. As if he had some path! Whatsoever he was saying was a simple rationalization for not accepting the truth that he was afraid.\nIt is always a dangerous thing to encounter the awakened man, because immediately you can see where you are.\nIt is said in Arabian countries that the camel does not like to go near any mountain because he is afraid to be in the close proximity of a mountain – he will have to realize that he is nothing. Perhaps that’s why he lives in the desert where he appears to be the most mountainous animal, incomparable.\nJung’s fear of going to Ramana Maharshi is also associated with his fear of going to one other place. His whole life he was interested in going to Egypt to see the ancient mummies, the dead bodies which have been preserved for at least four thousand years. Many times he planned and many times he canceled the trip. He was just about to go so many times: his suitcases were ready, he just had to sit in the car and reach the airport, and suddenly he would feel sick, ill, some problem would arise, and he would cancel the trip. Once he even reached the airport and came back home.\nFinally he had to look for the real cause why so many times he had been canceling it, and he had to take note of it: that he was afraid of seeing dead bodies, four thousand years old. Maybe he was still a little far away from the truth, but he had been looking in the right direction. He was afraid of death; those dead bodies would remind him of his own death.\nThese two things are in some way connected. Going to a man like Ramana is passing through the death of the ego, because the only way to go to the awakened is to go in deep surrender and trust. It is a death, far deeper than the physical death. He avoided Ramana, and still he went on saying things about the East which are not true, because he had never experienced the Eastern depth of mysticism.\nYou will see in the Mandukya Upanishad how penetrating has been the vision – psychology is lagging far behind. It has taken a very significant step, but only one step, and the journey is still incomplete; much further it has to go.\nBefore Sigmund Freud the Western mind accepted only one state, that is our so-called waking state, it had not even accepted the reality of dreams. Sigmund Freud’s great contribution is: bringing the world of dreams into focus, allowing it to be analyzed, interpreted, observed – because before Sigmund Freud the West was living only with the first state, the so-called waking state. He at least took one step deeper, but there are still two more steps to be taken; only then will the psychological science be complete.\nHidden beneath the dreaming state is dreamless sleep SUSHUPTI, and hidden even within and below and also beyond the third state is the real awakening, the fourth. The Upanishads simply call it ‘the fourth’, TURIYA. They don’t give it a name, because to give it any name may give you some idea, and no idea can be given of it unless you have experienced it. So they simply call it ‘the fourth’; that is significant. For the other three they have given names: JAGRUTI, the so-called waking state; SWAPNA, the dreaming state; SUSHUPTI, the dreamless sleep. But the fourth they have left only as’the fourth’ undefined; it has to be experienced to be known.\nThe Mandukya says:\nTHIS PURE SELF HAS FOUR QUARTERS...\nThe words ‘pure Self’ have to be understood – there is a possibility of misunderstanding because of the word ‘Self’. But the condition of purity makes it clear that by ‘the Self’ ego is not meant at all. You can call it ‘the egoless self’, because the ego is the impurity. All that is arbitrary and artificial is impure; all that is natural and intrinsic is pure. You bring your original face with you and then you start wearing masks; those masks are your impurity. And ego has many masks because you have to relate with many people; in different situations you need different faces. You have to change your face constantly.\nIt is said of George Gurdjieff that he was such a great actor that he would be talking to two persons, one sitting on the left and the other sitting on the right, and he would show different faces to both of them. When he turned to the left he would show one face, when he turned to the right he would show another face. And both the persons would argue later on about the man; they would both describe him in different ways. One would say, “How loving he was! How compassionate! How blissful!” And the other would say, “What are you saying? Have you gone mad? He was so arrogant, so egoistic, so cruel, so violent, almost murderous!”\nGurdjieff used to enjoy that very much; he would leave such different impressions. He was capable of changing his mask because he knew his original face. You don’t know your original face. You change your masks, but that too is mechanical, almost autonomous – you don’t change it, it changes by itself. When you are talking to your wife you have one face, when you are talking to your beloved you have another face.\nJust watch a little and you will be able to see the truth of it. When you are talking to your boss you can’t have the same face as when you are talking to your servant. When the boss enters your room you immediately stand up, wagging your tail – which does not exist but still you way! And when the servant enters the room you don’t take any note of him at all. If you are reading your newspaper you go on reading, if you are smoking you go on smoking. He is a nonentity; there is no need to take any note of him. He comes and goes as if he has not come and not gone; nothing has happened, he is not an event. If even a rat comes in the room you will take note of it – you many stand on your chair – but the servant does not exist.\nWatch next time when your servant enters the room or your boss enters the room, your wife, your child, your friend, your enemy, and look how different you are.\nThe ‘pure Self’ means the original face, unadulterated, unpolluted, the pure mirror with no reflection,\nwith nothing to reflect. It has four quarters – four dimensions you can call them, four stages you can call them, four quarters you can call them.\nTHE FIRST IS THE WAKING STATE..\nThe translation is not right. The translation should be: The first is the SO-CALLED waking state. The word’so-called’ is missing – because it is NOT really a waking state, it is only so-called. Do you think you are awake? Each morning you open your eyes, that is one thing, but to be awake is totally different. Just close your eyes any time in the day and you will find an undercurrent of dreams, fantasies going on.\nEven modern psychology accepts that only a very small fragment of our totality is conscious, one- tenth, and that too is very fragile, just skin-deep, or not even that deep. Scratch it a little and immediately it disappears. Insult somebody, step on somebody’s toes, and immediately he loses consciousness, he becomes mad. Just a word is enough to make him enraged. Anger is a temporary madness: that fragile part of his being which was just a little conscious – just a little candle – is all dark now.\nThat’s why many times you say, “I did it in spite of myself.” What do you mean, ‘in spite of myself’? How can you do anything in spite of yourself? Is there somebody else within you too who can do something in spite of you? When you say it you simply mean, “I became so unconscious, so mad, that I did something which if I had been a little bit sane I would not have even thought about.”\nWe are living in a so-called waking state; it is somnambulistic. There are people, and they are not few – one person out of every ten persons, ten percent of people who are somnambulists. You may have one in your family! If your family consists of ten persons, probably there is one person who is a somnambulist, who walks in his sleep. There are many people; they may not be aware, their families may not be aware, unless they are caught red-handed, and this rarely happens because everybody is asleep.\nIn the middle of the night they will wake up, not really awake – their eyes are open but very glassy. If you see their eyes – glassy. But they manage to get out of the door, to reach. the kitchen, to open the fridge, to eat something, go to bed again. And in the morning they complain, “I don’t have any appetite today. I don’t know why I am getting fat!” And they may not be Lying at all, they may be telling it sincerely – that they try to diet and they try to exercise, but somehow they go on gathering fat. They get up in their sleep.\nPeople have been known to do strange things in their sleep – even murders have happened! People have murdered in their sleep, and they were absolutely true when in the court they said, “We don’t know anything about this murder!” Of course every proof is there that they have murdered – their fingerprints are on the person’s neck – still they are right, they are not wrong! A few husbands have killed their wives; they could not gather courage enough in their waking state, but while asleep they managed, gathered their guts. But in the morning they have forgotten all about it.\nPapa Bear: “Somebody has eaten my porridge!” Baby Bear: “Somebody has eaten my porridge too!”\nMama Bear: “Shut up, you idiots! I haven’t served it yet!”\nThe plane transporting twenty-two inmates from one madhouse to another was flying at three thousand feet. The pilot and the steward were in the cockpit when all of a sudden the plane started tilting to the right, then to the left, then to the right again.\nThe frightened steward went to see what was happening. One minute later he was back in the cockpit and the plane was back to normal.\n“What was the matter?” asked the pilot. “What were they doing?” “They were playing football!”\n“Well, how did you stop them?” asked the pilot.\nThe steward grinned. “I said, ‘Hey, boys, it’s such a nice day, why don’t you go outside and play?’”\nAn insomniac who could not fall asleep until shortly before it was time to get up consulted his doctor who prescribed sleeping pills. He took a pill before retiring and sure enough he fell promptly asleep, but awoke before he heard the alarm clock.\nFor the first time in weeks he felt refreshed, and after bathing and breakfasting, leisurely strolled into the office. “I took a sleeping pill,” he told the boss, “and didn’t have any trouble getting up this morning.”\n“That’s interesting,” replied the boss, “but where were you yesterday?”\nA woman had been killed, robbed of all her belongings and left naked on the footpath. The first person to find her, a rabbi, quickly took off his hat to cover her nakedness. The next man to pass by asked what was going on.\n“Well,” said the rabbi, “this woman is dead. I was going to find somebody to remove the body.” “Hold on a minute!” replied the other man. “Hadn’t you better get that rabbi out of there first?”\nPeople in the so-called waking state are not awake; they are still dreaming, just their eyes are open. They are behaving mechanically. Yes, they are efficient in doing the routine work, because they have become accustomed to doing it. There is something like a robot part of the mind: once you have learnt to do a certain thing it is transferred to the robot part of the mind; then it goes on doing it without your being aware of it. It is programmed.\nAnd this is one of the things to be very deeply understood: we are all programmed. We have been programmed by the priests, by the politicians, by all kinds of ideologists. From the very childhood you have been programmed; a certain program has been put into your head and you are following that program.\nWhen a Hindu sees a temple, suddenly he bows down – that is only a program. He is not doing it, he does not MEAN it; he may not even be aware why he is doing it or that he is doing it. He is simply\nbowing down because from the very childhood he has been forced to do it. Now he has learnt the trick – it is ONLY a trick.\nIt almost always happens whenever you are repeating rituals; you need not be aware. Every Sunday suddenly you feel the urge to go to the church – for no reason at all. If you don’t go you will feel as if you have missed something; if you go you don’t gain anything at all.\nIt is just like smoking: if you smoke the cigarette you don’t get anything, or perhaps you get something – cancer, et cetera – but if you don’t smoke, the idea of smoking haunts you. You feel something is missing, you feel disturbed; the routine has not been fulfilled. You have to do it, otherwise your program inside goes on knocking, “Do it!” Unless you do it, it will not leave you alone. Whether it is smoking or prayer does not matter, it is all the same. If it is out of your programming there is no difference in it at all.\nYou don’t feel like bowing down before a Mohammedan mosque if you are a Hindu or before a church if you are a Mohammedan or before a temple if you are a Christian. Why? Those are also places devoted to God dedicated to God, but no desire arises because that is not YOUR programming, that is not your conditioning.\nYour so-called waking state is full of mechanical habits; you simply go on repeating them – and each generation goes on giving its mechanical habits to the new generation. That’s why progress seems to be so impossible, because parents go on imprinting their children with THEIR programming, and that programming has been coming for centuries, maybe thousands-of-years-old programming. Their parents programmed them and their parents and their parents, and it has been going on since Adam and Eve, perhaps even before that, because God programmed Adam and Eve. “Not to eat from this tree” is a program, is a conditioning. “You should do this, you should not do this” He\nbehaved just like any other stupid father, NO difference at all, and he punished like any father – he threw Adam and Eve out of the garden of Eden.\nThis waking state is not a real waking state. The real waking state happens only when you are completely deprogrammed, unconditioned.\nTwo drunks, Moe and Harry, meet. “How ya, Harry? Did we kill a bottle together last night?” “No,” replies Harry.\n“Oh,” says Moe, “must have been two other guys!” Even the drunkard believes that he can reason!\nThe punch-drunk prize-fighter, having dropped to the mat from a crushing blow, was about to get up. “Stay down until eight!” yelled his manager.\nThe fighter mumbled in a daze, “What time is it now?”\nThe honeymoon is over when she starts wondering what happened to the man she married, and he starts wondering what happened to the girl he didn’t.\nPeople just go on doing things, not knowing why they are doing them. People get married, then they become parents, then whatsoever has been done to them they start doing to their children. Perhaps they are taking revenge on their parents, paying the debts. They cannot do the same to their parents, but they can become parents and can do the same to their little children, and in their own turn the children will do the same thing. That’s how diseases go on being transferred from one generation to another. Progress seems to be impossible.\nIt is really miraculous that a few people like Buddha, Lao Tzu, Mahavira, Krishna, escaped from this programming, conditioning process of the society. It is certainly a miracle! I don’t call it a miracle when Jesus walks on water – even if he does, so what? – but I call it a miracle that he escaped from the Jewish conditioning. That is a miracle, a true miracle. I don’t call it a miracle if he makes Lazarus come back from death – maybe he was just in a coma, perhaps he was not really dead. I don’t call it a miracle that Jesus after crucifixion comes back alive, because in those days the method of crucifixion, the Jewish method, was so old-fashioned that it used to take at least twenty-four hours to forty-eight hours for a person to die – and he was taken down from the cross after six hours, and he was a young man, only thirty-three. Perhaps he was not dead. It was a very slow process of death – very torturous because it was very slow.\nWe are more human when we put a man in the electric chair: within seconds he is gone. He will not even be aware, he may be thinking of other things, while he is thinking, he is gone. Suddenly he finds he is gone – suddenly he looks at the chair and there is a dead body and he is hovering above! This is far more human. But forty-eight hours hanging on the cross, blood oozing out of your body, slowly slowlyWhen all the blood has gone out of the body and nothing is left behind, then\nonly will you die.\nSo I don’t call resurrection a great miracle, but getting out of the Jewish tradition, getting out of the Jewish conditioning is certainly a miracle. Buddha getting out of the Hindu fold, the Hindu mob psychology, was doing a tremendous act, a great rebellion – effacing the whole mind. That’s what he did for six years continuously; people think he was meditating.…\nMeditation, in fact, is a blanket word; it covers many processes, and the basic process is de- programming. For those six years he was simply de-programming himself, getting out of the clutches of Hinduism. The moment he was completely out he became enlightened.\nTwo hippies are walking along a road. One says, “Hey, man, I just had a great idea!” “Wow! Far out! What is it?”\n“Forgotten it, man!”\nBut that’s how we are! We go on getting great ideas, but they are just like smoke: one moment they are there and then they are gone. It needs a dedicated effort, a continuous endeavor, to get rid of your programming, because it has been done over so many years. You have been chained within and without by such subtle conditions that unless you are very very watchful and intelligent you will not be able to escape from the prison.\nBut in fact we don’t want to get out of the prison. All that we want is to make the prison a little more comfortable, a little more cozy. A beautiful painting on the prison wall, good furniture – maybe\nantique – wall-to-wall carpeting, and you are perfectly happy. That’s what people are doing by earning money, power, prestige: making their prison cells a little bit better – maybe putting in an air-conditioner, installing electric lights, having a television set.…\nPeople are not really interested in getting out of the prison. If they are interested then nobody can prevent them. Maybe it takes effort, constant effort, perseverance, but they can get out of it.\nThe bachelor prayer:\n“I pray thee, O Lord, that I may not be married; but if I am to be married, that I may not be a cuckold; but if I am to be a cuckold, that I may not know it; but if I am to know it, that I may not mind it.”\nOur prayers, our desires are not really to be free, to be liberated. And this Mandukya Upanishad is basically for your total liberation. It is a key.\nTHE FIRST IS THE SO-CALLED WAKING STATE, EXPERIENCE OF THE REALITY COMMON TO EVERYONE.\nWhat we call the objective reality. Science studies this objective reality of which we are aware in our so-called waking state. Hence the Upanishads call science AVIDYA, ignorance – a very strange definition of science, but very true too. The Upanishads call science ignorance, AVIDYA, and religion they call VIDYA – religion they call TRUE science, TRUE knowing, wisdom. And science they don’t call science at all, because the word’science’ means knowing – it is not knowing. They call it AVIDYA, ignorance. The English word ‘ignorance’ is beautiful; it means you are ignoring the essential and are getting too obsessed with the non-essential.\nThe Upanishads are right in calling science AVIDYA, ignorance, because you are ignoring yourself and what you are trying to study is only a public reality of the so-called waking state. The waking state itself is pseudo, superficial, and the reality that it observes is bound to be superficial.\nTHE ATTENTION FACES OUTWARDS, ENJOYING THE WORLD IN ALL ITS VARIETY.\nThe mind can function in two ways, either outwards or inwards. When it functions outwards it becomes extrovert and it creates science, when it functions inwards it becomes subjective, then it dreams.\nPsychology studies dreaming and science studies your so-called waking, and this is our whole knowledge today: science plus psychology, Albert Einstein plus Sigmund Freud – two Jews! That’s our whole contribution to human progress.\nTHE SECOND IS EXPERIENCE OF SUBJECTIVE WORLDS, SUCH AS IN DREAMING.\nSoren Kierkegaard has defined religion as subjectivity – he is wrong. Religion has nothing to do with subjectivity. Objectivity is science, subjectivity is psychology; religion is a transcendence of both.\nWhat are you doing when you are dreaming? In fact, it is very strange, but true too, that you are far more real in your dreaming than your so-called waking state.\nThat’s why psychoanalysis wants to know about your dreaming. Your waking state is so pseudo it is not reliable at all. Whatsoever you say is not trustworthy; your dreams are more reliable. It is strange: dreams, which are thought to be unreal, are more reliable and your so-called waking state is absolutely unreliable.\nPeople say one thing and do another; everybody is a politician in his waking state. And the moment you are not a politician in your waking state, a miracle happens: your dreaming disappears, then you don’t dream at all. Dreaming is a complementary process: whatsoever you are repressing in your waking state becomes your dreaming – and the repressed is truer.\nThis is the true story of how Andrew Young was fired from his post of ambassador to the United Nations by President Carter.\nIt all started at a party that they both attended. The President met Andy in the men’s room. Stepping up to the urinal, the President looked over at Andy’s machinery and exclaimed, “My God, Andy! Where did you get that big dick from?”\n“Well, it’s simple, Jimmy,” Andy replied. “Each night before I go to bed I take it out and hit it up against the bedpost a couple of times. It springs right up, bigger than ever every time!”\nThe President looked amazed. He thanked Andy for the advice and left. When Jimmy got home he took his clothes off, stood by the bed and gave the bedpost an audible whacking with his machinery, and sure enough up it came!\nRosalind, awakened by the sound, sat up, rubbed her eyes and said, “Is that you, Andy?”\nPeople are far truer when they are asleep! Dreams leak your reality. When you are in a so-called waking state you are cautious; you say only what has to be said, what is right to say.\nLokowicz and Koczela staggered out of a tavern stumbled over to a lamp-post, unbuttoned, took things in hand and started to pee.\nA policeman saw them, wagged his night-stick and barked, “Put those away and stop what you are doing!”\nThe drunks buttoned their flies in clumsy obedience, but one smiled. “What’s so funny?” asked Koczela.\n“I fooled that cop,” said the other. “I put it away, but I didn’t stop!”\nWhen people are drunk they are truer, honest! When people are not drunk they are deceptive, cunning. Hence you will always find drunkards lovelier, nicer, better company to keep. Saints you\nwill not find good company; you cannot live with a saint for twenty-four hours – if he is really a saint you cannot. Twenty-four hours will be enough for you to commit suicide! – either you will kill him or you will kill yourself. Criminals are more innocent because they have not been repressing. Saints are very ugly; their whole life is rooted in repression.\nIf you can make small windows in the heads of your saints you will be puzzled to see what goes on inside. Their dreams are all ugly. Criminals don’t dream ugly dreams – I have lived with both. Criminals dream of becoming saints and saints dream of becoming criminals. It is a very upside- down world, a very strange world! Criminals are always thinking of how to become good, and saints are always dreaming of all that they have repressed: their sexuality, their desire for food, for money, for powerThey may be so deceptive that even their dreams are not direct, they are indirect. A\npsychoanalyst is needed to interpret them.\nThis is, according to the Mandukya Upanishad and according to all the Buddhas, the second state – closer to reality, remember. Sigmund Freud is not the discoverer of the fact. Waking, YOUR waking, is the farthest from the real; dreaming is a little closer.\nHERE THE ATTENTION DWELLS WITHIN, CHARMED BY THE MIND’S SUBTLER CREATIONS. THE THIRD IS DEEP SLEEP...\nwhich is even closer, the closest.\nTHE MIND RESTS, WITH AWARENESS SUSPENDED.\nThe first mind is focused outwards; it is the state of extroversion. In the second, the mind is focused inwards; it is the state of introversion. But in both cases the mind is functioning – in one with the objective reality, in the other with the subjective reality. In the third, the mind rests; it is non- functioning.\nThat’s why Patanjali has said that dreamless sleep is closest to SAMADHI, with only one simple difference: if you can add awareness to your dreamless sleep you will become awakened, you will achieve SAMADHI.\nTHE THIRD IS DEEP SLEEP,\nTHE MIND RESTS, WITH AWARENESS SUSPENDED.\nOnly one thing is missing, otherwise the whole situation is ready. Just a little awakening, a little awareness, and your whole life will be transformed. Dreamless sleep is the sleep that nourishes your body, that gives you a taste of rest. If in the night you have been dreaming continuously, in the morning you will feel utterly exhausted and tired. If you had at least a few moments of dreamless sleep you will wake up totally refreshed, and in the morning you will say, “I had a beautiful sleep. It was so blissful!” – but in the morning, because at the very moment when deep sleep was happening you were not aware at all, you were totally unconscious.\nSo the third state, which is the closest, is a negative kind of samadhi. It is emptiness. Mind is no more functioning and the soul has not yet started functioning. It is called by the Upanishads ‘the twilight zone’: the evening or the morning when the one state is gone and the other has not come in, just the boundary line. You touch it every night; every healthy person touches it every night. If you don’t touch it you go crazy, you go mad.\nTHIS STATE BEYOND DUALITY,\n– FROM WHICH THE WAVES OF THINKING EMERGE, IS ENJOYED BY THE ENLIGHTENED AS AN OCEAN OF SILENCE AND BLISS.\nOrdinarily you are not aware of it, but if you are enlightened then you will experience it as AN OCEAN OF SILENCE AND BLISS.\nTHE FOURTH – TURIYA – SAY THE WISE, IS THE PURE SELF ALONE.\nThe pure is simply awareness. DWELLING IN THE HEART OF ALL, IT IS THE LORD OF ALL,\nTHE SEER OF ALL,\nTHE SOURCE AND GOAL OF ALL.\nWe have to reach the fourth. One who achieves the fourth has become fulfilled. His spring has come, his lotus has opened. He becomes a Buddha, a Christ.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"5661","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/philosophia_ultima/part5/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/philosophia_ultima/>Philosophia Ultima</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">5 That State is Awakening</h1><div class=post-meta>27 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;5661 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Philosophia_Ultima/part5.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part4>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

HEART OF ALL,</p><p>IT IS THE LORD OF ALL, THE SEER OF ALL,</p><p>THE SOURCE AND GOAL OF ALL.</p><p><br></p><p>CARL GUSTAV JUNG thinks that the Eastern approach to reality is
introvert – he is utterly wrong. The Eastern approach is neither
extrovert nor introvert; it is a transcendence of both. But to
understand the transcendence one has to be a Buddha, one has to be
really awakened.</p><p><br></p><p>The ordinary mind can think only of two things: the outside reality
and the inside reality. There is no possibility of comprehending the
beyond, and the beyond is the concern of all Eastern mysticism.</p><p><br></p><p>The Upanishads are the source of all that is beautiful, true,
blissful, all that is significant as far as human evolution is
concerned.</p><p><br></p><p>One of my friends, a great poet, Ramdhari Singh Dinkar went to China.
He was talking to a great Chinese philosopher, Lin Yu-Tang. Ramdhari had
heard much from me about Lao Tzu; he had become immensely interested in
the Taoist approach to reality. He said to Lin Yu-Tang, “I love Lao
Tzu.” Lin Yu-Tang looked at the poet, puzzled, and said, “But the source
of Lao Tzu is in the Upanishads!”</p><p><br></p><p>And Lin Yu-Tang is right, sincerely right: the whole mysticism of the
East, wherever it has happened – in India, in China, in Japan – has its
source in the Upanishads. And this Upanishad, the Mandukya Upanishad, is
one of the most fundamental, because in a very essential way it
describes the innermost core and also the ultimate reach of human
consciousness</p><p><br></p><p>The ordinary mind is dual; it thinks in terms of twoness: light and
dark, day and night, summer and winter, life and death, good and bad,
moral and immoral, extrovert and introvert, the real and the unreal, the
momentary and the permanent. The duality is always there; it has entered
into the very fabric of our languages.</p><p><br></p><p>But the moment you become really awakened... and remember the word
‘really’, because we think that every morning we are awake when we come
out of sleep. That is only pseudo awakening, that is only so-called
awakening. The real awakening is when one becomes a Jesus, a Buddha, a
Mahavira, a Lao Tzu. When one has come to see the merger of the within
and the without, when one has come to see the oneness of life and death,
when there is no division left, that state is awakening. Before that
everybody is a little bit schizophrenic because the divided mind divides
you. Then you are divided into the lower and the higher, then you are
divided into the conscious and the unconscious, the body and the soul,
and so on and so forth.</p><p><br></p><p>Carl Gustav Jung is not right at all in saying that Eastern mysticism
is introvert. That is a condemnation, because in psychology the
word’introversion’ is ugly. It means somebody is morbid, it means
somebody is closed to the outside reality, it means that one is not
open.</p><p><br></p><p>Jung had come to India while a great seer was alive, Sri Ramana
Maharshi, and many people told him to go and see him – but he didn’t go
there. He traveled all over India, he went to see the Taj</p><p>Mahal and Khajuraho Ajanta and Ellora, but he didn’t go to see Ramana
Maharshi. Basically he was afraid. The fear was that a man like Ramana
can become a mirror; he might see his own face, his own falseness.</p><p><br></p><p>But people rationalize everything. He rationalized that he didn’t go
to see Ramana because the Western mind is extrovert and the Eastern mind
is introvert, their approaches are different and it is better not to get
them mixed, otherwise one can lose one’s path. As if he had some path!
Whatsoever he was saying was a simple rationalization for not accepting
the truth that he was afraid.</p><p><br></p><p>It is always a dangerous thing to encounter the awakened man, because
immediately you can see where you are.</p><p><br></p><p>It is said in Arabian countries that the camel does not like to go
near any mountain because he is afraid to be in the close proximity of a
mountain – he will have to realize that he is nothing. Perhaps that’s
why he lives in the desert where he appears to be the most mountainous
animal, incomparable.</p><p><br></p><p>Jung’s fear of going to Ramana Maharshi is also associated with his
fear of going to one other place. His whole life he was interested in
going to Egypt to see the ancient mummies, the dead bodies which have
been preserved for at least four thousand years. Many times he planned
and many times he canceled the trip. He was just about to go so many
times: his suitcases were ready, he just had to sit in the car and reach
the airport, and suddenly he would feel sick, ill, some problem would
arise, and he would cancel the trip. Once he even reached the airport
and came back home.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally he had to look for the real cause why so many times he had
been canceling it, and he had to take note of it: that he was afraid of
seeing dead bodies, four thousand years old. Maybe he was still a little
far away from the truth, but he had been looking in the right direction.
He was afraid of death; those dead bodies would remind him of his own
death.</p><p><br></p><p>These two things are in some way connected. Going to a man like
Ramana is passing through the death of the ego, because the only way to
go to the awakened is to go in deep surrender and trust. It is a death,
far deeper than the physical death. He avoided Ramana, and still he went
on saying things about the East which are not true, because he had never
experienced the Eastern depth of mysticism.</p><p><br></p><p>You will see in the Mandukya Upanishad how penetrating has been the
vision – psychology is lagging far behind. It has taken a very
significant step, but only one step, and the journey is still
incomplete; much further it has to go.</p><p><br></p><p>Before Sigmund Freud the Western mind accepted only one state, that
is our so-called waking state, it had not even accepted the reality of
dreams. Sigmund Freud’s great contribution is: bringing the world of
dreams into focus, allowing it to be analyzed, interpreted, observed –
because before Sigmund Freud the West was living only with the first
state, the so-called waking state. He at least took one step deeper, but
there are still two more steps to be taken; only then will the
psychological science be complete.</p><p>Hidden beneath the dreaming state is dreamless sleep SUSHUPTI, and
hidden even within and below and also beyond the third state is the real
awakening, the fourth. The Upanishads simply call it ‘the fourth’,
TURIYA. They don’t give it a name, because to give it any name may give
you some idea, and no idea can be given of it unless you have
experienced it. So they simply call it ‘the fourth’; that is
significant. For the other three they have given names: JAGRUTI, the
so-called waking state; SWAPNA, the dreaming state; SUSHUPTI, the
dreamless sleep. But the fourth they have left only as’the fourth’
undefined; it has to be experienced to be known.</p><p><br></p><p>The Mandukya says:</p><p><br></p><p>THIS PURE SELF HAS FOUR QUARTERS...</p><p><br></p><p>The words ‘pure Self’ have to be understood – there is a possibility
of misunderstanding because of the word ‘Self’. But the condition of
purity makes it clear that by ‘the Self’ ego is not meant at all. You
can call it ‘the egoless self’, because the ego is the impurity. All
that is arbitrary and artificial is impure; all that is natural and
intrinsic is pure. You bring your original face with you and then you
start wearing masks; those masks are your impurity. And ego has many
masks because you have to relate with many people; in different
situations you need different faces. You have to change your face
constantly.</p><p><br></p><p>It is said of George Gurdjieff that he was such a great actor that he
would be talking to two persons, one sitting on the left and the other
sitting on the right, and he would show different faces to both of them.
When he turned to the left he would show one face, when he turned to the
right he would show another face. And both the persons would argue later
on about the man; they would both describe him in different ways. One
would say, “How loving he was! How compassionate! How blissful!” And the
other would say, “What are you saying? Have you gone mad? He was so
arrogant, so egoistic, so cruel, so violent, almost murderous!”</p><p><br></p><p>Gurdjieff used to enjoy that very much; he would leave such different
impressions. He was capable of changing his mask because he knew his
original face. You don’t know your original face. You change your masks,
but that too is mechanical, almost autonomous – you don’t change it, it
changes by itself. When you are talking to your wife you have one face,
when you are talking to your beloved you have another face.</p><p><br></p><p>Just watch a little and you will be able to see the truth of it. When
you are talking to your boss you can’t have the same face as when you
are talking to your servant. When the boss enters your room you
immediately stand up, wagging your tail – which does not exist but still
you way! And when the servant enters the room you don’t take any note of
him at all. If you are reading your newspaper you go on reading, if you
are smoking you go on smoking. He is a nonentity; there is no need to
take any note of him. He comes and goes as if he has not come and not
gone; nothing has happened, he is not an event. If even a rat comes in
the room you will take note of it – you many stand on your chair – but
the servant does not exist.</p><p><br></p><p>Watch next time when your servant enters the room or your boss enters
the room, your wife, your child, your friend, your enemy, and look how
different you are.</p><p><br></p><p>The ‘pure Self’ means the original face, unadulterated, unpolluted,
the pure mirror with no reflection,</p><p>with nothing to reflect. It has four quarters – four dimensions you
can call them, four stages you can call them, four quarters you can call
them.</p><p><br></p><p>THE FIRST IS THE WAKING STATE..</p><p><br></p><p>The translation is not right. The translation should be: The first is
the SO-CALLED waking state. The word’so-called’ is missing – because it
is NOT really a waking state, it is only so-called. Do you think you are
awake? Each morning you open your eyes, that is one thing, but to be
awake is totally different. Just close your eyes any time in the day and
you will find an undercurrent of dreams, fantasies going on.</p><p><br></p><p>Even modern psychology accepts that only a very small fragment of our
totality is conscious, one- tenth, and that too is very fragile, just
skin-deep, or not even that deep. Scratch it a little and immediately it
disappears. Insult somebody, step on somebody’s toes, and immediately he
loses consciousness, he becomes mad. Just a word is enough to make him
enraged. Anger is a temporary madness: that fragile part of his being
which was just a little conscious – just a little candle – is all dark
now.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why many times you say, “I did it in spite of myself.” What do
you mean, ‘in spite of myself’? How can you do anything in spite of
yourself? Is there somebody else within you too who can do something in
spite of you? When you say it you simply mean, “I became so unconscious,
so mad, that I did something which if I had been a little bit sane I
would not have even thought about.”</p><p><br></p><p>We are living in a so-called waking state; it is somnambulistic.
There are people, and they are not few – one person out of every ten
persons, ten percent of people who are somnambulists. You may have one
in your family! If your family consists of ten persons, probably there
is one person who is a somnambulist, who walks in his sleep. There are
many people; they may not be aware, their families may not be aware,
unless they are caught red-handed, and this rarely happens because
everybody is asleep.</p><p><br></p><p>In the middle of the night they will wake up, not really awake –
their eyes are open but very glassy. If you see their eyes – glassy. But
they manage to get out of the door, to reach. the kitchen, to open the
fridge, to eat something, go to bed again. And in the morning they
complain, “I don’t have any appetite today. I don’t know why I am
getting fat!” And they may not be Lying at all, they may be telling it
sincerely – that they try to diet and they try to exercise, but somehow
they go on gathering fat. They get up in their sleep.</p><p><br></p><p>People have been known to do strange things in their sleep – even
murders have happened! People have murdered in their sleep, and they
were absolutely true when in the court they said, “We don’t know
anything about this murder!” Of course every proof is there that they
have murdered – their fingerprints are on the person’s neck – still they
are right, they are not wrong! A few husbands have killed their wives;
they could not gather courage enough in their waking state, but while
asleep they managed, gathered their guts. But in the morning they have
forgotten all about it.</p><p><br></p><p>Papa Bear: “Somebody has eaten my porridge!” Baby Bear: “Somebody has
eaten my porridge too!”</p><p>Mama Bear: “Shut up, you idiots! I haven’t served it yet!”</p><p><br></p><p>The plane transporting twenty-two inmates from one madhouse to
another was flying at three thousand feet. The pilot and the steward
were in the cockpit when all of a sudden the plane started tilting to
the right, then to the left, then to the right again.</p><p><br></p><p>The frightened steward went to see what was happening. One minute
later he was back in the cockpit and the plane was back to normal.</p><p><br></p><p>“What was the matter?” asked the pilot. “What were they doing?” “They
were playing football!”</p><p>“Well, how did you stop them?” asked the pilot.</p><p><br></p><p>The steward grinned. “I said, ‘Hey, boys, it’s such a nice day, why
don’t you go outside and play?’”</p><p><br></p><p>An insomniac who could not fall asleep until shortly before it was
time to get up consulted his doctor who prescribed sleeping pills. He
took a pill before retiring and sure enough he fell promptly asleep, but
awoke before he heard the alarm clock.</p><p><br></p><p>For the first time in weeks he felt refreshed, and after bathing and
breakfasting, leisurely strolled into the office. “I took a sleeping
pill,” he told the boss, “and didn’t have any trouble getting up this
morning.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s interesting,” replied the boss, “but where were you
yesterday?”</p><p><br></p><p>A woman had been killed, robbed of all her belongings and left naked
on the footpath. The first person to find her, a rabbi, quickly took off
his hat to cover her nakedness. The next man to pass by asked what was
going on.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well,” said the rabbi, “this woman is dead. I was going to find
somebody to remove the body.” “Hold on a minute!” replied the other man.
“Hadn’t you better get that rabbi out of there first?”</p><p>People in the so-called waking state are not awake; they are still
dreaming, just their eyes are open. They are behaving mechanically. Yes,
they are efficient in doing the routine work, because they have become
accustomed to doing it. There is something like a robot part of the
mind: once you have learnt to do a certain thing it is transferred to
the robot part of the mind; then it goes on doing it without your being
aware of it. It is programmed.</p><p><br></p><p>And this is one of the things to be very deeply understood: we are
all programmed. We have been programmed by the priests, by the
politicians, by all kinds of ideologists. From the very childhood you
have been programmed; a certain program has been put into your head and
you are following that program.</p><p><br></p><p>When a Hindu sees a temple, suddenly he bows down – that is only a
program. He is not doing it, he does not MEAN it; he may not even be
aware why he is doing it or that he is doing it. He is simply</p><p>bowing down because from the very childhood he has been forced to do
it. Now he has learnt the trick – it is ONLY a trick.</p><p><br></p><p>It almost always happens whenever you are repeating rituals; you need
not be aware. Every Sunday suddenly you feel the urge to go to the
church – for no reason at all. If you don’t go you will feel as if you
have missed something; if you go you don’t gain anything at all.</p><p><br></p><p>It is just like smoking: if you smoke the cigarette you don’t get
anything, or perhaps you get something – cancer, et cetera – but if you
don’t smoke, the idea of smoking haunts you. You feel something is
missing, you feel disturbed; the routine has not been fulfilled. You
have to do it, otherwise your program inside goes on knocking, “Do it!”
Unless you do it, it will not leave you alone. Whether it is smoking or
prayer does not matter, it is all the same. If it is out of your
programming there is no difference in it at all.</p><p><br></p><p>You don’t feel like bowing down before a Mohammedan mosque if you are
a Hindu or before a church if you are a Mohammedan or before a temple if
you are a Christian. Why? Those are also places devoted to God dedicated
to God, but no desire arises because that is not YOUR programming, that
is not your conditioning.</p><p><br></p><p>Your so-called waking state is full of mechanical habits; you simply
go on repeating them – and each generation goes on giving its mechanical
habits to the new generation. That’s why progress seems to be so
impossible, because parents go on imprinting their children with THEIR
programming, and that programming has been coming for centuries, maybe
thousands-of-years-old programming. Their parents programmed them and
their parents and their parents, and it has been going on since Adam and
Eve, perhaps even before that, because God programmed Adam and Eve. “Not
to eat from this tree” is a program, is a conditioning. “You should do
this, you should not do this<span class=s4></span>” He</p><p>behaved just like any other stupid father, NO difference at all, and
he punished like any father – he threw Adam and Eve out of the garden of
Eden.</p><p><br></p><p>This waking state is not a real waking state. The real waking state
happens only when you are completely deprogrammed, unconditioned.</p><p><br></p><p>Two drunks, Moe and Harry, meet. “How ya, Harry? Did we kill a bottle
together last night?” “No,” replies Harry.</p><p>“Oh,” says Moe, “must have been two other guys!” Even the drunkard
believes that he can reason!</p><p>The punch-drunk prize-fighter, having dropped to the mat from a
crushing blow, was about to get up. “Stay down until eight!” yelled his
manager.</p><p>The fighter mumbled in a daze, “What time is it now?”</p><p><br></p><p>The honeymoon is over when she starts wondering what happened to the
man she married, and he starts wondering what happened to the girl he
didn’t.</p><p>People just go on doing things, not knowing why they are doing them.
People get married, then they become parents, then whatsoever has been
done to them they start doing to their children. Perhaps they are taking
revenge on their parents, paying the debts. They cannot do the same to
their parents, but they can become parents and can do the same to their
little children, and in their own turn the children will do the same
thing. That’s how diseases go on being transferred from one generation
to another. Progress seems to be impossible.</p><p><br></p><p>It is really miraculous that a few people like Buddha, Lao Tzu,
Mahavira, Krishna, escaped from this programming, conditioning process
of the society. It is certainly a miracle! I don’t call it a miracle
when Jesus walks on water – even if he does, so what? – but I call it a
miracle that he escaped from the Jewish conditioning. That is a miracle,
a true miracle. I don’t call it a miracle if he makes Lazarus come back
from death – maybe he was just in a coma, perhaps he was not really
dead. I don’t call it a miracle that Jesus after crucifixion comes back
alive, because in those days the method of crucifixion, the Jewish
method, was so old-fashioned that it used to take at least twenty-four
hours to forty-eight hours for a person to die – and he was taken down
from the cross after six hours, and he was a young man, only
thirty-three. Perhaps he was not dead. It was a very slow process of
death – very torturous because it was very slow.</p><p><br></p><p>We are more human when we put a man in the electric chair: within
seconds he is gone. He will not even be aware, he may be thinking of
other things, while he is thinking, he is gone. Suddenly he finds he is
gone – suddenly he looks at the chair and there is a dead body and he is
hovering above! This is far more human. But forty-eight hours hanging on
the cross, blood oozing out of your body, slowly slowly<span class=s4></span>When all the blood has gone out of the body and
nothing is left behind, then</p><p>only will you die.</p><p><br></p><p>So I don’t call resurrection a great miracle, but getting out of the
Jewish tradition, getting out of the Jewish conditioning is certainly a
miracle. Buddha getting out of the Hindu fold, the Hindu mob psychology,
was doing a tremendous act, a great rebellion – effacing the whole mind.
That’s what he did for six years continuously; people think he was
meditating.…</p><p><br></p><p>Meditation, in fact, is a blanket word; it covers many processes, and
the basic process is de- programming. For those six years he was simply
de-programming himself, getting out of the clutches of Hinduism. The
moment he was completely out he became enlightened.</p><p><br></p><p>Two hippies are walking along a road. One says, “Hey, man, I just had
a great idea!” “Wow! Far out! What is it?”</p><p>“Forgotten it, man!”</p><p><br></p><p>But that’s how we are! We go on getting great ideas, but they are
just like smoke: one moment they are there and then they are gone. It
needs a dedicated effort, a continuous endeavor, to get rid of your
programming, because it has been done over so many years. You have been
chained within and without by such subtle conditions that unless you are
very very watchful and intelligent you will not be able to escape from
the prison.</p><p><br></p><p>But in fact we don’t want to get out of the prison. All that we want
is to make the prison a little more comfortable, a little more cozy. A
beautiful painting on the prison wall, good furniture – maybe</p><p>antique – wall-to-wall carpeting, and you are perfectly happy. That’s
what people are doing by earning money, power, prestige: making their
prison cells a little bit better – maybe putting in an air-conditioner,
installing electric lights, having a television set.…</p><p><br></p><p>People are not really interested in getting out of the prison. If
they are interested then nobody can prevent them. Maybe it takes effort,
constant effort, perseverance, but they can get out of it.</p><p><br></p><p>The bachelor prayer:</p><p><br></p><p>“I pray thee, O Lord, that I may not be married; but if I am to be
married, that I may not be a cuckold; but if I am to be a cuckold, that
I may not know it; but if I am to know it, that I may not mind it.”</p><p><br></p><p>Our prayers, our desires are not really to be free, to be liberated.
And this Mandukya Upanishad is basically for your total liberation. It
is a key.</p><p><br></p><p>THE FIRST IS THE SO-CALLED WAKING STATE, EXPERIENCE OF THE REALITY
COMMON TO EVERYONE.</p><p>What we call the objective reality. Science studies this objective
reality of which we are aware in our so-called waking state. Hence the
Upanishads call science AVIDYA, ignorance – a very strange definition of
science, but very true too. The Upanishads call science ignorance,
AVIDYA, and religion they call VIDYA – religion they call TRUE science,
TRUE knowing, wisdom. And science they don’t call science at all,
because the word’science’ means knowing – it is not knowing. They call
it AVIDYA, ignorance. The English word ‘ignorance’ is beautiful; it
means you are ignoring the essential and are getting too obsessed with
the non-essential.</p><p><br></p><p>The Upanishads are right in calling science AVIDYA, ignorance,
because you are ignoring yourself and what you are trying to study is
only a public reality of the so-called waking state. The waking state
itself is pseudo, superficial, and the reality that it observes is bound
to be superficial.</p><p><br></p><p>THE ATTENTION FACES OUTWARDS, ENJOYING THE WORLD IN ALL ITS
VARIETY.</p><p>The mind can function in two ways, either outwards or inwards. When
it functions outwards it becomes extrovert and it creates science, when
it functions inwards it becomes subjective, then it dreams.</p><p><br></p><p>Psychology studies dreaming and science studies your so-called
waking, and this is our whole knowledge today: science plus psychology,
Albert Einstein plus Sigmund Freud – two Jews! That’s our whole
contribution to human progress.</p><p><br></p><p>THE SECOND IS EXPERIENCE OF SUBJECTIVE WORLDS, SUCH AS IN
DREAMING.</p><p>Soren Kierkegaard has defined religion as subjectivity – he is wrong.
Religion has nothing to do with subjectivity. Objectivity is science,
subjectivity is psychology; religion is a transcendence of both.</p><p><br></p><p>What are you doing when you are dreaming? In fact, it is very
strange, but true too, that you are far more real in your dreaming than
your so-called waking state.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why psychoanalysis wants to know about your dreaming. Your
waking state is so pseudo it is not reliable at all. Whatsoever you say
is not trustworthy; your dreams are more reliable. It is strange:
dreams, which are thought to be unreal, are more reliable and your
so-called waking state is absolutely unreliable.</p><p><br></p><p>People say one thing and do another; everybody is a politician in his
waking state. And the moment you are not a politician in your waking
state, a miracle happens: your dreaming disappears, then you don’t dream
at all. Dreaming is a complementary process: whatsoever you are
repressing in your waking state becomes your dreaming – and the
repressed is truer.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the true story of how Andrew Young was fired from his post of
ambassador to the United Nations by President Carter.</p><p><br></p><p>It all started at a party that they both attended. The President met
Andy in the men’s room. Stepping up to the urinal, the President looked
over at Andy’s machinery and exclaimed, “My God, Andy! Where did you get
that big dick from?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, it’s simple, Jimmy,” Andy replied. “Each night before I go to
bed I take it out and hit it up against the bedpost a couple of times.
It springs right up, bigger than ever every time!”</p><p><br></p><p>The President looked amazed. He thanked Andy for the advice and left.
When Jimmy got home he took his clothes off, stood by the bed and gave
the bedpost an audible whacking with his machinery, and sure enough up
it came!</p><p><br></p><p>Rosalind, awakened by the sound, sat up, rubbed her eyes and said,
“Is that you, Andy?”</p><p><br></p><p>People are far truer when they are asleep! Dreams leak your reality.
When you are in a so-called waking state you are cautious; you say only
what has to be said, what is right to say.</p><p><br></p><p>Lokowicz and Koczela staggered out of a tavern stumbled over to a
lamp-post, unbuttoned, took things in hand and started to pee.</p><p><br></p><p>A policeman saw them, wagged his night-stick and barked, “Put those
away and stop what you are doing!”</p><p><br></p><p>The drunks buttoned their flies in clumsy obedience, but one smiled.
“What’s so funny?” asked Koczela.</p><p><br></p><p>“I fooled that cop,” said the other. “I put it away, but I didn’t
stop!”</p><p><br></p><p>When people are drunk they are truer, honest! When people are not
drunk they are deceptive, cunning. Hence you will always find drunkards
lovelier, nicer, better company to keep. Saints you</p><p>will not find good company; you cannot live with a saint for
twenty-four hours – if he is really a saint you cannot. Twenty-four
hours will be enough for you to commit suicide! – either you will kill
him or you will kill yourself. Criminals are more innocent because they
have not been repressing. Saints are very ugly; their whole life is
rooted in repression.</p><p><br></p><p>If you can make small windows in the heads of your saints you will be
puzzled to see what goes on inside. Their dreams are all ugly. Criminals
don’t dream ugly dreams – I have lived with both. Criminals dream of
becoming saints and saints dream of becoming criminals. It is a very
upside- down world, a very strange world! Criminals are always thinking
of how to become good, and saints are always dreaming of all that they
have repressed: their sexuality, their desire for food, for money, for
power<span class=s4></span>They may be so deceptive that even their
dreams are not direct, they are indirect. A</p><p>psychoanalyst is needed to interpret them.</p><p><br></p><p>This is, according to the Mandukya Upanishad and according to all the
Buddhas, the second state – closer to reality, remember. Sigmund Freud
is not the discoverer of the fact. Waking, YOUR waking, is the farthest
from the real; dreaming is a little closer.</p><p><br></p><p>HERE THE ATTENTION DWELLS WITHIN, CHARMED BY THE MIND’S SUBTLER
CREATIONS. THE THIRD IS DEEP SLEEP...</p><p>which is even closer, the closest.</p><p><br></p><p>THE MIND RESTS, WITH AWARENESS SUSPENDED.</p><p><br></p><p>The first mind is focused outwards; it is the state of extroversion.
In the second, the mind is focused inwards; it is the state of
introversion. But in both cases the mind is functioning – in one with
the objective reality, in the other with the subjective reality. In the
third, the mind rests; it is non- functioning.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why Patanjali has said that dreamless sleep is closest to
SAMADHI, with only one simple difference: if you can add awareness to
your dreamless sleep you will become awakened, you will achieve
SAMADHI.</p><p><br></p><p>THE THIRD IS DEEP SLEEP,</p><p><br></p><p>THE MIND RESTS, WITH AWARENESS SUSPENDED.</p><p><br></p><p>Only one thing is missing, otherwise the whole situation is ready.
Just a little awakening, a little awareness, and your whole life will be
transformed. Dreamless sleep is the sleep that nourishes your body, that
gives you a taste of rest. If in the night you have been dreaming
continuously, in the morning you will feel utterly exhausted and tired.
If you had at least a few moments of dreamless sleep you will wake up
totally refreshed, and in the morning you will say, “I had a beautiful
sleep. It was so blissful!” – but in the morning, because at the very
moment when deep sleep was happening you were not aware at all, you were
totally unconscious.</p><p>So the third state, which is the closest, is a negative kind of
samadhi. It is emptiness. Mind is no more functioning and the soul has
not yet started functioning. It is called by the Upanishads ‘the
twilight zone’: the evening or the morning when the one state is gone
and the other has not come in, just the boundary line. You touch it
every night; every healthy person touches it every night. If you don’t
touch it you go crazy, you go mad.</p><p><br></p><p>THIS STATE BEYOND DUALITY,</p><p><br></p><p>– FROM WHICH THE WAVES OF THINKING EMERGE, IS ENJOYED BY THE
ENLIGHTENED AS AN OCEAN OF SILENCE AND BLISS.</p><p>Ordinarily you are not aware of it, but if you are enlightened then
you will experience it as AN OCEAN OF SILENCE AND BLISS.</p><p><br></p><p>THE FOURTH – TURIYA – SAY THE WISE, IS THE PURE SELF ALONE.</p><p><br></p><p>The pure is simply awareness. DWELLING IN THE HEART OF ALL, IT IS THE
LORD OF ALL,</p><p>THE SEER OF ALL,</p><p><br></p><p>THE SOURCE AND GOAL OF ALL.</p><p><br></p><p>We have to reach the fourth. One who achieves the fourth has become
fulfilled. His spring has come, his lotus has opened. He becomes a
Buddha, a Christ.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part4>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

‌CHAPTER 16
This is Far Out
26 December 1980 am in Buddha Hall
The first question Question 1
OSHO: THE OTHER DAY YOU SAID THAT SEX FOR REPRODUCTION IS SINFUL. I HAVE ALSO READ YOUR WORDS SAYING THAT THE GREATEST CREATIVE ACT OF A WOMAN IS IN PRODUCING A CHILD, AND THAT THERE IS A VAST DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A MOTHER AND A WOMAN.
IF THIS IS SO, THEN IS THERE SIN IN PARTICIPATING IN SEX AND IN LOVE IN THE HOPE OF CREATING A CHILD AND EXPERIENCING THE JOY OF CREATION AND THE RENEWING ENERGY OF THE UNIVERSE?</description>

Man is Born as Freedom
12 December 1980 am in Buddha Hall
The first question Question 1
OSHO: I HEARD YOU SAY ONCE THAT THE MISUSE OF FREEDOM IS HARMFUL. HOW CAN FREEDOM BE MISUSED?
Prem Tara
THE PHILOSOPHERS HAVE ALWAYS believed that essence precedes existence, that man is born with what he is going to be already determined. Just like a seed he contains the whole program; now the question is only of unfoldment.</description>

‌CHAPTER 6
You Transcend Duality
16 December 1980 am in Buddha Hall
The first question Question 1
OSHO: AGAIN YOU INVITE US TO SHOUT THE TRUTH FROM THE HOUSETOPS.
YES, SINCE I AM HERE, CREATIVITY IS BECOMING MORE INTENSE AND VAST, AND MY SONG IS BECOMING MORE AND MORE FULL OF COLORS AND DANCE AND GRACE.
BUT ON THE OTHER SIDE AN EMPTY SPACE, A COOL SILENCE IS CALLING ME MORE AND MORE GENTLY, MORE AND MORE SEDUCING, MORE AND MORE SCARY, BECAUSE IN THIS SILENCE ALL THE COLORS OF MY CREATIVITY FADE AWAY.</description>

‌CHAPTER 7
Spirituality is the Ultimate in Luxury
17 December 1980 am in Buddha Hall
The first question Question 1
OSHO: IN ONE OF YOUR LECTURES ON SOCIALISM, ANSWERING SARJANO’S QUESTION, YOU INDICATED THAT THE PROLETARIAT WERE ‘THE LOWEST’.
IS THIS CONTRADICTORY TO CHRIST’S TEACHINGS ON THE POOR AS BEING THE CHILDREN OF GOD AND THE RICH AS BEING ‘THE LOWEST’?
DURING YEARS OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT WORK WITH POOR PEASANTS IN LATIN AMERICA, I FOUND THEM TO BE ‘HIGHER’ SPIRITUALLY THAN THE RICH LANDLORDS.</description>

OSHO: I AM ANOTHER ‘DEVELOPMENT WORKER’ WHOSE QUESTIONS YOU ANSWERED MOST BEAUTIFULLY YESTERDAY.
FOR ME, THOUGH, ONE QUESTION REMAINS: WORKING TO HELP BROTHERS OUT OF THE MOLASSES SEEMS ALSO TO KEEP ME FROM FLYING. SHOULD WE FLY AND LEAVE THEM BE, AND STAY HERE IN THIS MAGIC PLACE, FOR EXAMPLE?</description>

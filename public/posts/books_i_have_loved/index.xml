‌CHAPTER 1
1984 in Lao Tzu House, Rajneeshpuram, Oregon, USA
The guest, the host, the white chrysanthemum... these are the moments, the white roses, when no one should speak.
Neither the guest, nor the host... only silence.
But silence speaks in its own way, sings its own song of joy, of peace, of beauty and blessings; otherwise there would not have been a TAO TE CHING, nor would there have been a SERMON ON THE MOUNT.</description>

‌CHAPTER 10
1984 in Lao Tzu House, Rajneeshpuram, Oregon, USA
Okay, how many books have I talked about in the postscript – forty? “Thirty, I think, Osho.”
Thirty? Good. Such a relief, because so many books are still waiting. You could understand my relief only if you had to choose one book out of a thousand, and that’s exactly what I am doing. The postscript continues.</description>

‌CHAPTER 11
1984 in Lao Tzu House, Rajneeshpuram, Oregon, USA
Okay. How many books have I referred to in the P.S. up to now? “There have been forty books in the P.S., Osho.”
Good. I am a stubborn man.
First, Colin Wilson’s THE OUTSIDER. It is one of the most influential books of this century – but the man is ordinary. He is a scholar of tremendous capacity, and yes, there are a few insights here and there – but the book is beautiful.</description>

‌CHAPTER 12
1984 in Lao Tzu House, Rajneeshpuram, Oregon, USA
Okay, now this is the post-postscript. It is hard to understand my difficulty. As far as I can remember I have always been reading and doing nothing, day in, day out, for almost half a century. Naturally, to select is almost an impossible task. But I have undertaken it during these sessions, so the responsibility is yours.</description>

‌CHAPTER 13
1984 in Lao Tzu House, Rajneeshpuram, Oregon, USA
The first book today is Irving Stone’s LUST FOR LIFE. It is a novel based on the life of Vincent van Gogh. Stone has done such a tremendous work that I don’t remember anybody else doing the same. Nobody has written so intimately about somebody else, as if he is writing from his very own being.</description>

‌CHAPTER 14
1984 in Lao Tzu House, Rajneeshpuram, Oregon, USA
I have come to know, Devageet, that you freaked out this morning. Once in a while freaking is a good exercise, but freaking out I don’t support. It is a common variety – what they call the garden variety. Freak in! If you are going to freak at all, why out? why not in?</description>

‌CHAPTER 15
1984 in Lao Tzu House, Rajneeshpuram, Oregon, USA
Okay. The first book I am going to talk about in this P.P.S. is one nobody would think I would ever talk about. It is Mahatma Gandhi’s autobiography, MY EXPERIMENTS WITH TRUTH. Talking about his experiments with truth is really wonderful. This is the right time.
Ashu, you go on and on; otherwise I will start condemning Mahatma Gandhi.</description>

‌CHAPTER 16
1984 in Lao Tzu House, Rajneeshpuram, Oregon, USA
How many books have I talked about in the P.P.S? Hmmm? “Forty, Osho.”
Forty?
“Yes, Osho.”
I am a stubborn man you know. I am going to end it at fifty whatsoever happens; otherwise I will start another P.P.P.S. My stubbornness has really repaid me: it has helped me to fight all kinds of nonsense that the world is full of.</description>

‌CHAPTER 2
1984 in Lao Tzu House, Rajneeshpuram, Oregon, USA
I apologize because this morning I did not mention a few books that I should have mentioned. I was so overwhelmed by Zarathustra, Mirdad, Chuang Tzu, Lao Tzu, Jesus and Krishna that I forgot a few of the books which are even far more significant. I could not believe how I could forget Kahlil Gibran’s THE PROPHET.</description>

‌CHAPTER 3
1984 in Lao Tzu House, Rajneeshpuram, Oregon, USA
Now my work begins. What a joke! The joke of all jokes is that Sosan, the Chinese sage, was knocking at the door of my consciousness. These mystics are too much. You can never know at what moment they will start knocking at your doors. You are making love to your girlfriend, and Sosan comes and starts knocking.</description>

‌CHAPTER 4
1984 in Lao Tzu House, Rajneeshpuram, Oregon, USA
Okay. Get ready for your notes.
The world would have lost much without people like Devageet. We would not have known anything of Socrates if Plato had not written notes, nor of Buddha, nor Bodhidharma. Jesus too is known through his disciples’ notes. Mahavira is said never to have uttered a single word. I know the meaning of why it is said.</description>

‌CHAPTER 5
1984 in Lao Tzu House, Rajneeshpuram, Oregon, USA
Now the work begins.
“Athato brahman jigyasa – now the inquiry into the ultimate...” that’s how Badrayana begins his great book, perhaps the greatest. Badrayana’s book is the first I am going to talk about today. He begins his great book BRAHMAN SUTRAS with this sentence: “Now the enquiry into the ultimate.” That’s how all the sutras in the East begin, always with “Now.</description>

‌CHAPTER 6
1984 in Lao Tzu House, Rajneeshpuram, Oregon, USA
Now the postscript. In the last session, when I said this is the end of this series of fifty books that I wanted to include in my list, it was only arbitrary. I don’t mean the end, but the number. I had chosen fifty because I thought it would be a good number. Anyway one has to decide, and all decisions are arbitrary.</description>

‌CHAPTER 7
1984 in Lao Tzu House, Rajneeshpuram, Oregon, USA
Okay. I have heard your notebook open. Now it is my hour, and my hour does not consist of sixty minutes. It can be anything – sixty, seventy, eighty, ninety, one hundred... or beyond numbers even. If it is my hour then of course it has to be consistent with me, not vice versa.</description>

‌CHAPTER 8
1984 in Lao Tzu House, Rajneeshpuram, Oregon, USA
Be a Junnatha – a seeker. The P.S. continues.
The first book is Friedrich Nietzsche’s WILL TO POWER. He never published it while he was alive. It was published posthumously, and meanwhile, before it was published, many of your so-called great men had already stolen from the manuscript.
Alfred Adler was one of the ‘greatest’ psychologists.</description>

‌CHAPTER 9
1984 in Lao Tzu House, Rajneeshpuram, Oregon, USA
Now is my time. I don’t think anybody has spoken in a dentist’s chair. I feel privileged. I see buddhas envious of me.
The P.S. continues.…
The first book today: THE DESTINY OF THE MIND by Haas. I don’t know how his name is pronounced: h-a-a-s – I pronounce it Haas. The book is not very well known for the simple reason that it is so profound.</description>

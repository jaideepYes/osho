BEFORE THE EXISTENCE OF THE WORLD THE SELF-NATURE REMAINS INTACT. NOW THAT YOU HAVE SEEN THIS OLD MONK, YOU ARE NO LONGER SOMEONE ELSE, BUT A MASTER OF YOURSELF. WHAT’S THE USE OF SEEKING ANOTHER IN THE EXTERIOR?\nONCE A MONK ASKED JOSHU: “WHAT IS YOUR FAMILY’S TRADITION?”\nJOSHU RESPONDED: “I HAVE NOTHING INSIDE, AND I SEEK FOR NOTHING OUTSIDE.”\nManeesha, the word ‘zazen’ has to be understood before I can start discussing the sutras that you have brought. Zen I have explained to you. It comes from the Sanskrit dhyan. Buddha never used\nSanskrit as a part of his revolution. Sanskrit was the language of the learned, it has never been a language of the masses. Buddha broke away from tradition and started speaking in the language of the masses. It was a revolt against scholarship, learnedness, the pundits, the rabbis, the people of the scripture, whose whole heart is in their books. And because of those books they cannot see the reality.\nBuddha started speaking in the language of his province, Pali. In Pali, dhyan changes its form a little bit. It becomes jhan. When Bodhidharma reached China, jhan again changed, into Chinese; it became ch’an. And when the school of Rinzai took the same message to Japan from China, the word ch’an came very close to the very original Pali, jhan. It became in Japan, zen.\nIn English there is no equivalent word. There are words like concentration, contemplation... but they are all of the mind. Dhyan means going beyond the mind. It is not concentration, it is not contemplation; it is just letting the mind be put aside and looking at reality and your own existence directly, without the mind interpreting it.\nHave you ever tried small experiments? Watching a roseflower, can you watch the roseflower without the mind saying, “How beautiful”? Can you just watch the rose without the mind saying anything at all? In that moment you are in the state of dhyan, or zen.\nI am reminded of a story. Twenty-five centuries ago it was a great coincidence that in Greece there was Socrates and in India were Gautam Buddha and Mahavira, and in China there were Lao Tzu and Chuang Tzu – all expressing the existential truth, indicating towards it. It is very strange that suddenly, all over the world, there were at least six people fully awakened. Their words may be different because their languages are different, but their indication is to the same moon. That is absolutely certain.\nDhyan means looking, either outside or inside, without thinking – just looking straight forward. Your eyes become only a mirror. The mirror never says anything to anybody. Neither does it condemn the ugly nor does it appreciate the beautiful; it is simply non-judgmental.\nDhyan is, exactly, a non-judgmental state of mirror-like consciousness, just seeing and not saying anything. Then seeing becomes total. And in that seeing is the truth, is the good, is the beauty.\nBecause of this phenomenon, in the East there is no equivalent word for ‘philosophy’. In the East the word that has become equivalent is darshan, but darshan refers to a totally different dimension than philosophy. Philosophy means love of wisdom. It is love of knowledge. And darshan means just the opposite: not the love of wisdom or of knowledge, but of seeing. Darshan means seeing. Dhyan is the method, the path; and darshan, seeing the truth with your own eyes, is the goal of the whole Eastern effort.\nWhat is zazen? Zen is, just once or twice a day... in the early morning when the sun is rising and the birds are singing, you sit silently by the side of the ocean or the river or the lake. It is not something that you have to do continuously. It is just like any other activity. You take your bath – that does not mean that for twenty-four hours you have to continue taking a shower. Zazen exactly means that: taking a shower continuously. Zen is a periodic effort to see the truth. Zazen is a twenty-four hour, around-the-clock remaining aware, alert, in the state beyond mind. Your activities should show it,\nyour words should show it. Even your walking should show it – the grace, the beauty, the truth, the validity, the authority.\nSo zazen is an extension of Zen around the clock. Just because of zazen, monasteries came into existence. Because if you are living an ordinary life of a householder you cannot manage to contemplate, to be in the state of Zen twenty-four hours a day. You have to do many other things. And there is every possibility that while you are doing other things you may forget the undercurrent. So monasteries came into existence. The society decided that the people who want to go deeper into their being are doing such a great experiment for the whole humanity, because if even one man becomes a buddha, with him the whole humanity rises a little bit in consciousness.\nIt may not be apparent. It is just like when the Ganges... a big river, so big that by the time it reaches to meet the ocean its name, from Ganga, becomes Gangasagar, “the ocean of Ganges.” It becomes oceanic – so vast. As it moves into the ocean, the ocean certainly rises a little bit. The ocean is so vast that even hundreds and thousands of rivers never create a flood in the ocean, but certainly even a single dewdrop raises the level. At least you can comprehend it: a single dewdrop losing itself in the ocean, and the ocean is something more than it was before – one dewdrop more.\nThe people of those days were certainly more subjective, of more clarity that the real evolution of man is not in developing machines, technology; the real evolution has to happen in the consciousness of man. His consciousness has to become a pinnacle, an Everest, a peak that rises high above the clouds. If even a single man succeeds, it is not only his success, it is also the success of all men – past, present, future – because it gives a clear-cut indication that we are not trying; otherwise we could also be buddhas. Those who have tried, have become. It is our intrinsic nature.\nThe society supported the monks, supported the monasteries. There were thousands of monasteries with thousands of monks who were not doing anything. Society allowed them – “We are engaged in production. We will provide you with food and clothes. You go totally into your effort of reaching the highest peak of consciousness. Your success is not going to be only your success. If thousands of people become buddhas, the whole humanity, without any effort, will find a certain rise in consciousness.”\nThis was a great insight. And society took over the burden of thousands of monks, of thousands of monasteries; all their needs were fulfilled by the society. Today, that society has disappeared because today even the concept that you are a hidden buddha has disappeared. A strange idea has caught humanity, that every man is an island. And that is sheer nonsense. Even the islands are not islands. Just go down a little deeper and they are joined with the continent.\nEverybody is joined, it is just a question of going a little deeper. Our roots are entangled with each other, our source of life is the same.\nIt was a tremendous insight of those days that they decided – particularly, for example, in Tibet: every family had to contribute one child to the monastery, and in the monastery he had to do only zazen. He had no other work to distract him.\nBut now that possibility does not exist. Hence, I have managed different devices in which you can remain in the world – no need to go to a monastery, because there is nobody to support you. You\ncan be in the world and yet manage an undercurrent of fire that slowly slowly becomes like your breathing. You don’t have to remember it.\nManeesha has asked:\nBELOVED OSHO,\nON ONE OCCASION, JOSHU SAID TO HIS MONKS:\nI HAVE SINGLE-HEARTEDLY PRACTICED ZAZEN IN THE SOUTHERN PROVINCE FOR THIRTY YEARS.\nHe is referring to those thirty years with his master, Nansen. He is saying, “I have single- heartedly practiced zazen for thirty years continuously, without ever bothering about how far away enlightenment is.” Is it going to happen or not? Is it a truth or just a mirage? Is it something real or only a fiction created by dreamers? Without any doubt, how can one sustain for thirty years the same routine around the clock – walking, sitting, sleeping?\nThe whole heart is devoted to one thing: how to become more conscious, how to become a witness, how to remain a witness whatever happens. It is possible only if you have come in contact with a master, exceptions not included. The master is an example that the dream can be fulfilled. That it is not a dream, it is a reality – it is just that we have not tried in the right way.\nJoshu could continue for thirty years just because he saw Nansen. The very presence of Nansen filled him with a great explosion of joy. “It is possible! If it is possible for Nansen, it is possible for me.”\nNansen had asked him, “Do you have a master or not?” and he did not reply to exactly the question that was asked. He said, “I am with the master.” He said, “My master is in front of me,” indicating Nansen, who was lying down meditating. And he addressed Nansen as “Tathagata.”\nTathagata is the most lovely word used for Gautam Buddha. Just out of respect, the disciples don’t use the name Gautam Buddha, they use the word “Tathagata.” And tathagata is very meaningful. It comes from tathata. Tathata means thisness, just here and now – a man who always remains here and now, never wavering towards past or future, is a tathagata. He neither goes anywhere nor comes back, he simply remains here. Time passes by, clouds pass by, but nothing touches him. His being here is from eternity to eternity. That is the most cherished word the followers of Buddha used to address him.\nJoshu said to Nansen, “Tathagata, I am with my master.” And in that moment something happened – just in silence. Nothing was said, nothing was heard, but something transpired, something was transferred. In Zen they call it “transmission of the lamp.” And Nansen never asked him to be initiated; neither did Joshu ask to be initiated. The initiation had happened without any ceremony and without anybody ever knowing it. The moment he called him “Tathagata”... that moment was very precious. “I am with my master.”\nNansen accepted him, without saying anything. He simply called the head monk of the monastery and told him, “Take care of this new fellow. He is going to become ripe very soon. If he can recognize\nme as tathagata, he has already moved half the way. It won’t take long for him to recognize himself as tathagata. He has the right vision, the right direction... just a question of a little time.”\nBut that “little time” took thirty years. Those days of patience are gone. Now you need quick things, the quicker the better. Because of this strange idea of quickness all things that grow very slowly and very silently have disappeared. Consciousness is one of those things which you cannot grow quickly. Thirty years sitting in zazen, Joshu became enlightened. What Nansen said was, “He will take just a little time.” In the eyes of Nansen, thirty years are just a little time compared to the eternity of existence on both sides. What is thirty years? Nothing, not even a little time.\nJoshu was talking to his disciples:\n“IF YOU WANT TO REALIZE ENLIGHTENMENT, YOU SHOULD REALIZE THE ESSENCE OF BUDDHISM, DOING ZAZEN.”\nThe essence of Buddhism is not in the scriptures, not in the words of Buddha. It is something to be understood, because it has far-reaching implications. Whatever Buddha has said is as close to truth as possible, but even being close to truth, it is not true. Even closeness is only a kind of distance. So you cannot find the essence of the experience of Buddha through the scriptures. That is the ordinary conception of people, that if you read Buddhism, if you become a learned scholar of Buddhism, you will know the essence of it.\nOne great Buddhist monk, Bhadant Anand Kausalyayan, met me by chance in a Buddhist conference in Bodhgaya. He took me out of the crowd and asked me, “Whatever you were saying is so authoritative, but... Forgive me for interrupting you, I loved whatever you said, but I have never found in any scripture the stories you were telling. And I am the head of the Buddhist Society of India.”\nI had heard his name, I had read his books. I said, “It is a great opportunity to meet you. I have loved your books, but I can say to you that you don’t know the essence of Buddhism. Otherwise you would have understood my stories. It does not matter whether it really happened or not.”\nHe said, “What do you mean?”\nI said, “Whatever I have said, if it has not happened it should have happened. That’s what I mean. Even Gautam Buddha cannot deny it. It may not have happened – that I can accept, that it is not factual. I don’t care much about facts. To me, truth is something more than a factual incident. It is anything that carries the essence.”\nHe said, “You are a strange fellow. I have never heard such an idea.”\nHe lived in Nagpur. I used to pass Nagpur once in a while; he would always come and he would say, “This story I have read in your book. I loved it, but the problem is that it never happened in Buddha’s life.”\nI said, “For that I am not responsible. If it did not happen, what can I do? It should have happened! You are a learned scholar; you can add it somewhere in the Buddhist scriptures.”\nHe said, “What are you saying? Nothing can be added to the scriptures.” I said, “Any scripture to which nothing can be added is dead.”\nWhen I entered America, the inquiry officer asked me a few questions... whether I am an anarchist, a communist. I told him, “Listen, I am a living man.” He said, “What do you mean?”\nI said, “I may not be anarchist today, but tomorrow I can be an anarchist. So this whole stupid inquiry... with a living man! You should only allow the dead who are not going to change, ever. Living persons you should not allow in America. Because I am continuously growing, new leaves will come, new flowers will come. Who knows? Anarchism, communism...”\nHe said, “You are a strange fellow! I am asking a simple thing, I am not a philosopher.”\nI said, “I am also not a philosopher, but make a note that your inquiry is applicable to a dead person only – not to a living person. If you ask me this moment what I am, I can tell you. Next moment, nobody knows what I will be. Even I don’t know. Then don’t call me contradictory. I am a communist, I am an anarchist, and a little more. Do you have any category?”\nGautam Buddha, twenty-five centuries back... I can add much more to his teachings. These twenty- five centuries have not gone by in vain. Consciousness has taken on new terms, has known new skies, has flown farther than ever before. Because of this stupidity that you cannot add anything, all the scriptures become dead.\nI asked Anand Kausalyayan, “If Gautam Buddha himself had lived for twenty-five centuries, do you think he would be saying the same things?”\nHe said, “You are crazy, but rational. It is true. If he had lived for twenty-five centuries, he would have added much.”\nI said, “Then it is my responsibility to add a few things here and there. I take the liberty because I have tasted the same consciousness. You have not tasted the consciousness – that’s why you are worried. You know only the dead scripture, which died twenty-five centuries ago. I am a living scripture.”\nTo realize the essence of Buddhism is to realize what Buddha realized, is to go as deep into yourself as Buddha went in. That’s what we are doing here. And we are not Buddhists, we don’t belong to any dead tradition or any dead orthodoxy. There is no need. We are all carrying the buddha within us – why go on searching anywhere else?\nThat is the purpose of zazen, to search through all the garbage that you have accumulated down the centuries. You have been here on the earth for four million years in different shapes, in different bodies, in different species. You have gathered so much around your small buddha that you will have to dig as deep as possible. And don’t waver in digging.\nOne great Sufi mystic, Jalaluddin Rumi, one day took his disciples to a field where a farmer had been trying for months to dig a well. The disciples were feeling a little reluctant – what is the point\nin going there? Whatever he wants to say, he can say here. But Jalaluddin insisted: “You come with me. Without coming you will not understand.”\nWhat the farmer had done was, he would start digging in one place, go ten feet, twelve feet, would not find water and would start digging in another place. He had dug eight holes and now he was working on the ninth. He had destroyed the whole field.\nRumi told his disciples, “Don’t be like this idiot. If he had put all this energy into digging one hole he would have found water, howsoever deep it is. He has wasted his energy unnecessarily.”\nAnd that’s what everybody is doing. You start, you go a little bit, and then you start again sometime later, or some years later. You go a little bit from a different direction.\nThese little bits are dangerous. Your effort should be concentrated, and once you start, and you have a master in whom you can trust and in whom you can see the realization of a buddha, then there is no going back. Then go on digging, even if it takes thirty years.\nThat’s what Joshu is saying:\nIN THE COURSE OF THREE, FIVE, TWENTY OR THIRTY YEARS, IF YOU FAIL TO GRASP THE WAY, YOU MAY CUT OFF MY HEAD AND MAKE IT INTO A LADLE TO DRAW URINE WITH.\nI promise you, at the risk of my head, that if you continue... one never knows. Three years, five years, twenty years, thirty years – one never knows how much garbage you have gathered. Sometimes it can happen in a single moment. Sometimes it can take years. It all depends on the thickness of the layers of dust, past memories, future aspirations, and how courageous you are to cut the whole thing in a single blow.\nWithout any rest, go on digging. The water is certainly everywhere; so is the buddha-consciousness in every living being. Only man is so fortunate that he can understand it. Other animals are also on the way.…\nScientists think that the theory of evolution is Charles Darwin’s concept. In the scientific field it is true, but they are not aware of the Eastern concept of evolution. A very different concept – far more relevant and far more valid. It is not that one monkey simply becomes man. It is very difficult. You can force him, massage him, stretch him, operate on his tail, put his tie right, but a monkey is a monkey. I don’t think that suddenly one day some monkey got the idea, jumped out of the tree, stood on his two feet, and started becoming man. If so, all the other monkeys would have become man. They don’t become, they are still there in the trees.\nThe East does not mean by evolution that a monkey becomes a man, but the consciousness of a monkey may be born into a human being. It is not the body that evolves; it is the consciousness within that goes on taking higher forms, goes on reaching towards higher peaks. Man up to now is the highest peak of all that the animals have been trying to be, unconsciously. This is the fortunate situation for man, that he can do consciously some work that other animals cannot do.\nIt is impossible to teach meditation to a buffalo, although buffalos look more meditative than man. But nothing can be taught, and even if there are a few birds, or a few animals who can be taught a\nfew tricks, that does not become their evolution. They simply become actors. A few animals have the capacity to imitate, but only to imitate. Neither can they add anything nor can they delete anything.\nI told Anand Kausalyayan, “You are old, but still it is not too late. The essence of Buddhism is not in the Buddhist scriptures, the essence of Buddhism is in being a buddha.” And one becomes a buddha if he reaches his own center.\nJoshu is completely certain; otherwise he would not have made such a statement: IN THE COURSE OF THREE, FIVE, TWENTY OR THIRTY YEARS... because in thirty years he became enlightened. He thinks, “If a man like me can become a buddha, then anybody can become. There are more intelligent people than me, more courageous people than me. Somebody may become in three years, somebody in five years.”\nThe question of time is irrelevant. The real thing is to begin now, don’t postpone for tomorrow. Deeper somewhere, there is a life source – that much is certain. You are alive, you are breathing, you are listening, your heart is beating. You are perfectly alive, so there must be a source from where life is coming to you. This much can be said with an absolute guarantee, that you are connected with the universe and that connection is your buddhahood.\nJOSHU IS ALSO REPORTED TO HAVE SAID:\nTHOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ARE ONLY SEEKERS AFTER BUDDHA, BUT NOT A SINGLE ONE IS A TRUE MAN OF TAO.\nTo be a seeker in a lukewarm way, thinking that buddhahood is certain...”If I don’t work it out today, there is tomorrow.” The seeker without an urgency – there are thousands of people around the world. There are even more cases now than at the time of Joshu – there are millions of people who have a certain idea that one day they will turn inwards, but that day has not come yet. There are so many other things to be done. There are always, there have always been thousands of people interested, but not interested enough to risk their whole life. And unless you risk your whole life, unless it becomes such an urgency that it has to be done whatever the consequences – whatsoever the losses, you have to know yourself – unless this becomes such a total thirst, you will not become a buddha. Or a man of Tao – which are not two things; a man of Tao is the Chinese expression for the same experience as becoming a buddha.\nBEFORE THE EXISTENCE OF THE WORLD THE SELF-NATURE REMAINS INTACT. NOW THAT\nYOU HAVE SEEN THIS OLD MONK – Joshu is pointing at himself. NOW THAT YOU HAVE SEEN THIS OLD MONK, YOU ARE NO LONGER SOMEONE ELSE, BUT A MASTER OF YOURSELF. If\nyou have seen me clearly, you have seen yourself clearly, because I am nothing but a mirror. Only a blind man can pass without seeing himself in me, his own image.\nThe master’s basic, fundamental function is to be a mirror to the disciple so the disciple can have a certain idea of what a man of Tao means, what it means to be a buddha.\nJoshu, with a lion’s roar, is saying, “When you have seen this old monk, you are no longer someone else but a master of yourself.” A master only reflects your masterhood. He reflects your potentiality, he reflects what originally you are and you have forgotten.\nWHAT IS THE USE OF SEEKING ANOTHER IN THE EXTERIOR?\nJoshu is saying, “If you cannot see the buddha in me, then don’t waste your time. You will not be able to see it anywhere.” This certainty comes with self-experience.\nI have called this book JOSHU – THE LION’S ROAR. Normally, buddhas are very humble. Joshu is also very humble but he cannot help but say with absolute authority that “once you have seen me, you have looked into a mirror. If you cannot find your master here, then you will be wasting your time wandering around the world, and you will think that you are a seeker. There is no need to seek; just see that you are fortunate to have come across a master.”\nThis authority arises out of absolute experience.\nONCE A MONK ASKED JOSHU, “WHAT IS YOUR FAMILY’S TRADITION?”\nBy “family” is not meant the ordinary family; by “family” is meant your master, your master’s master. Once you have become a buddha, you are reborn. Now there is no question of your ordinary family, your ordinary parents. Your master has become the one closest to you. Your master has become a rebirth for you. So, “WHAT IS YOUR FAMILY’S TRADITION?” someone asked Joshu.\nJOSHU RESPONDED... and you have to learn how these Zen masters respond, they don’t reply. They don’t repeat. Their response... perhaps the questioner has never dreamt that somebody will respond to his question in this way.\nJOSHU RESPONDED: “I HAVE NOTHING INSIDE, AND I SEEK FOR NOTHING OUTSIDE. This is\nthe tradition of my family. Inside, an empty heart asking for nothing. Outside, no desire, no ambition. This is the tradition of my family.”\nThis is the tradition of all the buddhas. This has to become your tradition too. Ryushu, a Zen poet, wrote:\nTHREE, TWO, ONE; ONE, TWO, THREE – HOW ARE YOU EVER GOING TO PROBE THE MYSTERIES OF ZEN?\nSPRING BIRDS BUSY ON MY ROOF AFTER THE RAIN\nTRY OUT SOME NEW SOUNDS, TWEETING AND CHIRPING.\nWhat does Ryushu mean by THREE, TWO, ONE? Man begins either from the concept of three... just like the Hindu trimurti, three faces of God, or like the Christian trinity. The words ‘trinity’ and\n‘trimurti’ both come from the same root, tri. The word ‘three’ comes from tri. Either one can begin from three – the knower, the known and the knowledge, the seeker, the sought and the search – or one can begin in a contrary way: ONE, TWO, THREE. One can start from oneself; then he finds the other, he witnesses it. The other can be anything in your inner experience. And then the third: the third is the very witnessing. The one who witnesses, the other, which is witnessed, and the process of witnessing is the third.\nRyushu is saying: Whatever you do, this way or that, you will not reach to the ultimate. These are all games, which philosophers tend to play. It is better not to get involved in games of spirituality, but just be silent and watch what is happening around you.\nSPRING BIRDS BUSY ON MY ROOF AFTER THE RAIN – watch these small things, the rain and the mist that it has left behind, and the fragrance that comes from the earth. And the birds who are busy on the roof – they are trying NEW SOUNDS, TWEETING AND CHIRPING. Ryushu is saying there is no need to be very serious about the search. You can become a witness of ordinary things – the witnessing is the same, whether you witness a bird chirping or you witness your mind chattering. Whether you witness a sunrise outside or you witness your innermost being, witnessing is the same.\nRyushu is saying, rather than getting involved in controversial philosophies, start from small things. Learn from small things one art – the art of witnessing. And then use that same art inwards. It is easier to learn it in the outside world.\nIt is because of this that Zen became a very artistic religion. No other religion is so artistic: their monasteries are beautiful gardens, with beautiful ponds, birds, great trees, thick forests, mountains... and all this is for zazen. You sit under an ancient tree and nothing has to be done: just watch.\nYou know the famous haikus:\nSITTING SILENTLY, DOING NOTHING, SPRING COMES\nAND THE GRASS GROWS BY ITSELF. ANCIENT POND,\nA FROG JUMPS IN THE SOUND\n– of the frog,\nand then the great silence. And you are just sitting by the side of an ancient tree.\nZen has made the spiritual search very aesthetic. First learn it from outside, watching the flowers and the sunrise and the sunset. The effort is not concerned with the object, the effort is to learn\nthe art of watching without any interpretation, without any judgment. A non-judgmental, mirror-like witnessing... if you have learned it from outside, it will be easy for you to enter in with the same art.\nQuestion 1 Maneesha has asked:\nBELOVED OSHO,\nIT SEEMS YOU HAVE CLOSED OFF ALL ESCAPE ROUTES FOR US. AM I RIGHT IN FEELING THAT ENLIGHTENMENT IS LESS AND LESS AN OPTION, BUT, RATHER, THE ONLY EXIT?\nIt is the only exit, Maneesha. It is not an option. You cannot avoid it. You can delay, you can postpone for centuries, but finally you will end up a buddha – so why unnecessarily wait? That’s how I became a buddha. When I saw that one has to become a buddha, this life or another life... when this has to happen, then why unnecessarily waste time? I simply dropped the idea of searching for Buddha and became a buddha.\nThe family in which I used to live at that time were suddenly surprised. They said “You are behaving very strangely!”\nI said, “I have to. Last night I became a buddha.”\nThey said, “This is not a joking matter... are you serious?” I said, “I have to be!”\nThey shrugged their shoulders, they said, “But how did you become a buddha?”\nI said, “That is not the question. Once I understood that it is the destiny of every living being, last night I thought: Why unnecessarily wait?”\nAnd since then, if I have tried to take even one holiday... It is not allowed. Once you have become a buddha, I warn you, then there are no holidays. Once a buddha, forever a buddha.\nSo Maneesha you are right, but it is not me who has closed all the routes, it is existence itself. It gives you as much rope as you want. But why unnecessarily remain miserable? Why unnecessarily remain in anguish? If you can become a buddha and have all the blessings of existence available to you, then why not this moment? It is not me, it is existence itself asking you, “Why not this moment?”\nLook at Zareen: she has come back to her place, has thrown away her migraine last night, and is again sitting behind Maneesha. Beware of Maneesha! because migraine is her old habit. She may throw it any moment. And it is very easy when the gibberish starts – everybody is throwing all kinds of bullshit. So remember one thing: go on throwing your bullshit with your mouth, and with your hands go on protecting yourself. Otherwise, only bullshit is exchanged and you go happy to your home thinking that it was great.\nA little change is good. But it is somebody else’s bullshit, so remember it: when you are deeply involved in throwing all your nonsense, keep protecting your mind with both your hands; otherwise you may get new rubbish, new rotten eggs, but you will remain the same. So be clever. Forcibly move away everything that is being thrown to you.\nManeesha, existence does not allow any option except enlightenment. It goes on forcing you towards enlightenment. It has infinite time available to it, so it is not in a hurry. But you should understand – what is the point of postponing it for tomorrow? That is what Buddha used to say: tathata, thisness, suchness, herenow – try to see a simple point that you are a buddha. And a mirror is in front of you! If a master cannot be a mirror to you, then either the master is not a master, or you are blind.\nJust a few days ago Hasya had gone to New Delhi for a press conference. She was showing a small video there about the ashram and its activities. She was very much puzzled that the journalists who had come, when I started speaking, started looking... somebody this way, somebody that way, somebody downwards. She could not understand what was the matter. Then the Delhi friends told her, “You don’t know, they all think that even to look into the eyes of this man is dangerous, or to hear his voice. You will be hypnotized.”\nThousands of people want to come here. But they will come only when I am dead, because then I cannot hypnotize them. Then they will bring flowers and offerings, too. Right now it is dangerous. And you know it is dangerous! Even though I am hiding my eyes, it does not matter. The energy that hypnotizes passes through the glasses. Just last night, Avirbhava and Anando have shown you: the energy knows no barrier. I have started wearing these glasses just to console people, so they can look towards me without fear – and I am going to do whatever I am supposed to do!\nIt is existence itself that brings you to a master. It is your own urge that impels you towards a master. There is no exit. Even if you go far away from me, it will not make any difference; I will haunt you wherever you go.\nZareen had gone to her house, but I haunted her there. In the morning she was back. I inquired of Anando, “Just look to see whether Zareen is back on the gate or not.” She said, “Why?”\nI said, “I have been haunting her the whole night! I hope that she is well enough and back at the gate where she is needed.”\nOnce you have become part of my caravan there is no way out, there is only a way in.\nNow Sardar Gurudayal Singh is repressing his desire. He wants to laugh even while I am speaking. But he has to suppress it because it will be very embarrassing, particularly for an old disciple. So he keeps suppressing it and waiting for his time. And his time comes.…\nPope the Polack dies and goes to heaven. He is met at the Pearly Gates by Saint Peter, who asks the Polack if he has any questions before he comes in.\n“Yes, I have,” replies the pope. “I always knew that I would go to heaven, but I often wondered what hell would be like.”\n“Okay,” says Saint Peter. “You can visit hell if you want. But you must return after half an hour, or you will get stuck there.”\nSo the Polack pope takes the elevator down to hell and finds himself in the lobby of a luxury hotel. He looks around and sees it is a beach resort, with beautiful men and women lazing around in the sun. There is a well-stocked bar, where the drinks are free, and a magnificent spread of multi-national food. A Brazilian band is playing a hot Samba, and everything is just far out!\nThe Polack wanders around in rapture for a while and then notices that his half an hour is nearly up. He makes a dash for the elevator and only just gets back in time.\nThe pope walks through the gates of heaven just as Saint Peter announces that lunch is ready. So the Polack pope sits himself down at the table.\nAfter a few moments they are joined by Jesus, who brings in a plate of peanut butter sandwiches and a pot of herb tea.\n“What is this?” cries the Polack, in dismay. “Down in hell, they eat pizza and ice cream, and drink French wine!”\n“Well,” replies Saint Peter, “it’s not worth putting on a fancy spread for just the three of us!”\nYoung Spud Kowalski wins a fortune in the Polish National Lottery. When he comes home that evening, he finds his dad, Kowalski, sitting in front of the TV.\n“Hi, Dad!” he says. “Guess what? I won the lottery today.”\n“I know,” says Kowalski, “I just saw it on the TV. Fifty thousand dollars!”\n“Well, Dad,” says Spud, “you and mom have been so good to me over the years that I have decided to give you a cut. Here Dad, take ten dollars.”\n“Wow! Thanks, son,” says Kowalski, examining the ten dollar bill carefully. “And now, let me give you some good advice.”\n“Okay Dad,” says Spud. “I’m listening.”\n“Son,” continues Kowalski, “don’t just waste your good fortune. Settle down and get married properly – not like your mother and me.”\n“Gee Dad!” cries Spud. “You mean you and mom never got married? Do you realize what that makes me?”\n“Sure I do, son,” snaps Kowalski. “And you’re a real tight one, too!”\nThree sailors – a German, an American and a Polack – are in a pub drinking a few beers. “Our submarines can stay under water for a half a year,” brags the German sailor.\n“That’s nothing,” says the American, swallowing his beer and wiping his lips. “Our nuclear submarines can stay under water for one whole year!”\n“Hey,” says the Polack sailor, spilling his beer. “That is really nothing. Our submarines dive down and never come up!”\nNivedano... (Drumbeat) (Gibberish) (Drumbeat)\nBe silent. Close your eyes, feel your body to be completely frozen.\nNow look inwards, gathering all your consciousness – almost like an arrow, forcing towards the center.\nAt the center you are the buddha. On the circumference you may be anybody, Tom, Dick, Harry; on the circumference you are all different but at the center your essential nature is that of a buddha, the man of Tao.\nDeeper and deeper – because the deeper you go, the more will be your experience of your eternal reality. Flowers will start showering on you, the whole existence will rejoice your silence.\nJust be a witness, from the center, and you have arrived home. To make it clear, Nivedano...\n(Drumbeat)\nRelax. Just remember that you are only a witness. The body is not you, the mind is not you. You are just a mirror.\nAnd as you settle down into a mirror-like witnessing, the whole existence takes on a tremendously beautiful form. Everything becomes divine.\nThis evening was beautiful on its own, but Joshu’s lion’s roar has made it tremendously beautiful. This very moment you are a buddha.\nWhen you come back, bring the buddha with you. You have to live out the buddha in your day-to-day life. I am against renouncing the world – I am for recreating the world. The more buddhas there are, the world will have new skies, new dimensions, new doors opening... new mysteries, new miracles.\nCollect as much fragrance and flowers as you can.\nNivedano... (Drumbeat)\nCome back, but come back as a buddha – peacefully, gracefully. Sit down for a few moments just to recollect your experience of the space that you have visited and the splendor that you have experienced.\nEvery day you have to go deeper and deeper.\nSo always remember how far you have gone: tomorrow you have to go a little more. It may take two, or five, or twenty, or thirty years – but you are to become a buddha. As far as I am concerned you are right now a buddha, you have only to gain courage.\nIn those thirty years you will not be changing into a buddha – you are a buddha already. Those thirty years are just to drop the doubt, the doubt that you – how can you be a buddha? Even if I say it, even if all the buddhas try to convince you, deep down is the doubt: “My god, me? and a buddha?” But one day you will become convinced by your own experience. There is no real conversion without your own experience.\nAnd Maneesha, I am not allowing you any exit. You have been out for centuries.\nNow you have to go in.\nOkay, Maneesha?\nYes, Osho.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"6951","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/joshu_the_lions_roar/part4/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/joshu_the_lions_roar/>Joshu.

THIRTY YEARS. IF YOU WANT TO REALIZE ENLIGHTENMENT, YOU SHOULD REALIZE
THE ESSENCE OF BUDDHISM, DOING ZAZEN.</p><p><br></p><p>IN THE COURSE OF THREE, FIVE, TWENTY OR THIRTY YEARS, IF YOU FAIL TO
GRASP THE WAY, YOU MAY CUT OFF MY HEAD AND MAKE IT INTO A LADLE TO DRAW
URINE WITH.</p><p><br></p><p>JOSHU IS ALSO REPORTED TO HAVE SAID:</p><p><br></p><p>THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ARE ONLY SEEKERS AFTER BUDDHA, BUT
NOT A SINGLE ONE IS A TRUE MAN OF TAO. BEFORE THE EXISTENCE OF THE WORLD
THE SELF-NATURE REMAINS INTACT. NOW THAT YOU HAVE SEEN THIS OLD MONK,
YOU ARE NO LONGER SOMEONE ELSE, BUT A MASTER OF YOURSELF. WHAT’S THE USE
OF SEEKING ANOTHER IN THE EXTERIOR?</p><p><br></p><p>ONCE A MONK ASKED JOSHU: “WHAT IS YOUR FAMILY’S TRADITION?”</p><p><br></p><p>JOSHU RESPONDED: “I HAVE NOTHING INSIDE, AND I SEEK FOR NOTHING
OUTSIDE.”</p><p><br></p><p>Maneesha, the word ‘zazen’ has to be understood before I can start
discussing the sutras that you have brought. Zen I have explained to
you. It comes from the Sanskrit dhyan. Buddha never used</p><p>Sanskrit as a part of his revolution. Sanskrit was the language of
the learned, it has never been a language of the masses. Buddha broke
away from tradition and started speaking in the language of the masses.
It was a revolt against scholarship, learnedness, the pundits, the
rabbis, the people of the scripture, whose whole heart is in their
books. And because of those books they cannot see the reality.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha started speaking in the language of his province, Pali. In
Pali, dhyan changes its form a little bit. It becomes jhan. When
Bodhidharma reached China, jhan again changed, into Chinese; it became
ch’an. And when the school of Rinzai took the same message to Japan from
China, the word ch’an came very close to the very original Pali, jhan.
It became in Japan, zen.</p><p><br></p><p>In English there is no equivalent word. There are words like
concentration, contemplation... but they are all of the mind. Dhyan
means going beyond the mind. It is not concentration, it is not
contemplation; it is just letting the mind be put aside and looking at
reality and your own existence directly, without the mind interpreting
it.</p><p><br></p><p>Have you ever tried small experiments? Watching a roseflower, can you
watch the roseflower without the mind saying, “How beautiful”? Can you
just watch the rose without the mind saying anything at all? In that
moment you are in the state of dhyan, or zen.</p><p><br></p><p>I am reminded of a story. Twenty-five centuries ago it was a great
coincidence that in Greece there was Socrates and in India were Gautam
Buddha and Mahavira, and in China there were Lao Tzu and Chuang Tzu –
all expressing the existential truth, indicating towards it. It is very
strange that suddenly, all over the world, there were at least six
people fully awakened. Their words may be different because their
languages are different, but their indication is to the same moon. That
is absolutely certain.</p><p><br></p><p>Dhyan means looking, either outside or inside, without thinking –
just looking straight forward. Your eyes become only a mirror. The
mirror never says anything to anybody. Neither does it condemn the ugly
nor does it appreciate the beautiful; it is simply non-judgmental.</p><p><br></p><p>Dhyan is, exactly, a non-judgmental state of mirror-like
consciousness, just seeing and not saying anything. Then seeing becomes
total. And in that seeing is the truth, is the good, is the beauty.</p><p><br></p><p>Because of this phenomenon, in the East there is no equivalent word
for ‘philosophy’. In the East the word that has become equivalent is
darshan, but darshan refers to a totally different dimension than
philosophy. Philosophy means love of wisdom. It is love of knowledge.
And darshan means just the opposite: not the love of wisdom or of
knowledge, but of seeing. Darshan means seeing. Dhyan is the method, the
path; and darshan, seeing the truth with your own eyes, is the goal of
the whole Eastern effort.</p><p><br></p><p>What is zazen? Zen is, just once or twice a day... in the early
morning when the sun is rising and the birds are singing, you sit
silently by the side of the ocean or the river or the lake. It is not
something that you have to do continuously. It is just like any other
activity. You take your bath – that does not mean that for twenty-four
hours you have to continue taking a shower. Zazen exactly means that:
taking a shower continuously. Zen is a periodic effort to see the truth.
Zazen is a twenty-four hour, around-the-clock remaining aware, alert, in
the state beyond mind. Your activities should show it,</p><p>your words should show it. Even your walking should show it – the
grace, the beauty, the truth, the validity, the authority.</p><p><br></p><p>So zazen is an extension of Zen around the clock. Just because of
zazen, monasteries came into existence. Because if you are living an
ordinary life of a householder you cannot manage to contemplate, to be
in the state of Zen twenty-four hours a day. You have to do many other
things. And there is every possibility that while you are doing other
things you may forget the undercurrent. So monasteries came into
existence. The society decided that the people who want to go deeper
into their being are doing such a great experiment for the whole
humanity, because if even one man becomes a buddha, with him the whole
humanity rises a little bit in consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>It may not be apparent. It is just like when the Ganges... a big
river, so big that by the time it reaches to meet the ocean its name,
from Ganga, becomes Gangasagar, “the ocean of Ganges.” It becomes
oceanic – so vast. As it moves into the ocean, the ocean certainly rises
a little bit. The ocean is so vast that even hundreds and thousands of
rivers never create a flood in the ocean, but certainly even a single
dewdrop raises the level. At least you can comprehend it: a single
dewdrop losing itself in the ocean, and the ocean is something more than
it was before – one dewdrop more.</p><p><br></p><p>The people of those days were certainly more subjective, of more
clarity that the real evolution of man is not in developing machines,
technology; the real evolution has to happen in the consciousness of
man. His consciousness has to become a pinnacle, an Everest, a peak that
rises high above the clouds. If even a single man succeeds, it is not
only his success, it is also the success of all men – past, present,
future – because it gives a clear-cut indication that we are not trying;
otherwise we could also be buddhas. Those who have tried, have become.
It is our intrinsic nature.</p><p><br></p><p>The society supported the monks, supported the monasteries. There
were thousands of monasteries with thousands of monks who were not doing
anything. Society allowed them – “We are engaged in production. We will
provide you with food and clothes. You go totally into your effort of
reaching the highest peak of consciousness. Your success is not going to
be only your success. If thousands of people become buddhas, the whole
humanity, without any effort, will find a certain rise in
consciousness.”</p><p><br></p><p>This was a great insight. And society took over the burden of
thousands of monks, of thousands of monasteries; all their needs were
fulfilled by the society. Today, that society has disappeared because
today even the concept that you are a hidden buddha has disappeared. A
strange idea has caught humanity, that every man is an island. And that
is sheer nonsense. Even the islands are not islands. Just go down a
little deeper and they are joined with the continent.</p><p><br></p><p>Everybody is joined, it is just a question of going a little deeper.
Our roots are entangled with each other, our source of life is the
same.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a tremendous insight of those days that they decided –
particularly, for example, in Tibet: every family had to contribute one
child to the monastery, and in the monastery he had to do only zazen. He
had no other work to distract him.</p><p><br></p><p>But now that possibility does not exist. Hence, I have managed
different devices in which you can remain in the world – no need to go
to a monastery, because there is nobody to support you. You</p><p>can be in the world and yet manage an undercurrent of fire that
slowly slowly becomes like your breathing. You don’t have to remember
it.</p><p><br></p><p>Maneesha has asked:</p><p><br></p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>ON ONE OCCASION, JOSHU SAID TO HIS MONKS:</p><p><br></p><p>I HAVE SINGLE-HEARTEDLY PRACTICED ZAZEN IN THE SOUTHERN PROVINCE FOR
THIRTY YEARS.</p><p><br></p><p>He is referring to those thirty years with his master, Nansen. He is
saying, “I have single- heartedly practiced zazen for thirty years
continuously, without ever bothering about how far away enlightenment
is.” Is it going to happen or not? Is it a truth or just a mirage? Is it
something real or only a fiction created by dreamers? Without any doubt,
how can one sustain for thirty years the same routine around the clock –
walking, sitting, sleeping?</p><p><br></p><p>The whole heart is devoted to one thing: how to become more
conscious, how to become a witness, how to remain a witness whatever
happens. It is possible only if you have come in contact with a master,
exceptions not included. The master is an example that the dream can be
fulfilled. That it is not a dream, it is a reality – it is just that we
have not tried in the right way.</p><p><br></p><p>Joshu could continue for thirty years just because he saw Nansen. The
very presence of Nansen filled him with a great explosion of joy. “It is
possible! If it is possible for Nansen, it is possible for me.”</p><p><br></p><p>Nansen had asked him, “Do you have a master or not?” and he did not
reply to exactly the question that was asked. He said, “I am with the
master.” He said, “My master is in front of me,” indicating Nansen, who
was lying down meditating. And he addressed Nansen as “Tathagata.”</p><p><br></p><p>Tathagata is the most lovely word used for Gautam Buddha. Just out of
respect, the disciples don’t use the name Gautam Buddha, they use the
word “Tathagata.” And tathagata is very meaningful. It comes from
tathata. Tathata means thisness, just here and now – a man who always
remains here and now, never wavering towards past or future, is a
tathagata. He neither goes anywhere nor comes back, he simply remains
here. Time passes by, clouds pass by, but nothing touches him. His being
here is from eternity to eternity. That is the most cherished word the
followers of Buddha used to address him.</p><p><br></p><p>Joshu said to Nansen, “Tathagata, I am with my master.” And in that
moment something happened – just in silence. Nothing was said, nothing
was heard, but something transpired, something was transferred. In Zen
they call it “transmission of the lamp.” And Nansen never asked him to
be initiated; neither did Joshu ask to be initiated. The initiation had
happened without any ceremony and without anybody ever knowing it. The
moment he called him “Tathagata”... that moment was very precious. “I am
with my master.”</p><p><br></p><p>Nansen accepted him, without saying anything. He simply called the
head monk of the monastery and told him, “Take care of this new fellow.
He is going to become ripe very soon. If he can recognize</p><p>me as tathagata, he has already moved half the way. It won’t take
long for him to recognize himself as tathagata. He has the right vision,
the right direction... just a question of a little time.”</p><p><br></p><p>But that “little time” took thirty years. Those days of patience are
gone. Now you need quick things, the quicker the better. Because of this
strange idea of quickness all things that grow very slowly and very
silently have disappeared. Consciousness is one of those things which
you cannot grow quickly. Thirty years sitting in zazen, Joshu became
enlightened. What Nansen said was, “He will take just a little time.” In
the eyes of Nansen, thirty years are just a little time compared to the
eternity of existence on both sides. What is thirty years? Nothing, not
even a little time.</p><p><br></p><p>Joshu was talking to his disciples:</p><p><br></p><p>“IF YOU WANT TO REALIZE ENLIGHTENMENT, YOU SHOULD REALIZE THE ESSENCE
OF BUDDHISM, DOING ZAZEN.”</p><p><br></p><p>The essence of Buddhism is not in the scriptures, not in the words of
Buddha. It is something to be understood, because it has far-reaching
implications. Whatever Buddha has said is as close to truth as possible,
but even being close to truth, it is not true. Even closeness is only a
kind of distance. So you cannot find the essence of the experience of
Buddha through the scriptures. That is the ordinary conception of
people, that if you read Buddhism, if you become a learned scholar of
Buddhism, you will know the essence of it.</p><p><br></p><p>One great Buddhist monk, Bhadant Anand Kausalyayan, met me by chance
in a Buddhist conference in Bodhgaya. He took me out of the crowd and
asked me, “Whatever you were saying is so authoritative, but... Forgive
me for interrupting you, I loved whatever you said, but I have never
found in any scripture the stories you were telling. And I am the head
of the Buddhist Society of India.”</p><p><br></p><p>I had heard his name, I had read his books. I said, “It is a great
opportunity to meet you. I have loved your books, but I can say to you
that you don’t know the essence of Buddhism. Otherwise you would have
understood my stories. It does not matter whether it really happened or
not.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “What do you mean?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Whatever I have said, if it has not happened it should have
happened. That’s what I mean. Even Gautam Buddha cannot deny it. It may
not have happened – that I can accept, that it is not factual. I don’t
care much about facts. To me, truth is something more than a factual
incident. It is anything that carries the essence.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “You are a strange fellow. I have never heard such an
idea.”</p><p><br></p><p>He lived in Nagpur. I used to pass Nagpur once in a while; he would
always come and he would say, “This story I have read in your book. I
loved it, but the problem is that it never happened in Buddha’s
life.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “For that I am not responsible. If it did not happen, what
can I do? It should have happened! You are a learned scholar; you can
add it somewhere in the Buddhist scriptures.”</p><p>He said, “What are you saying? Nothing can be added to the
scriptures.” I said, “Any scripture to which nothing can be added is
dead.”</p><p>When I entered America, the inquiry officer asked me a few
questions... whether I am an anarchist, a communist. I told him,
“Listen, I am a living man.” He said, “What do you mean?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I may not be anarchist today, but tomorrow I can be an
anarchist. So this whole stupid inquiry... with a living man! You should
only allow the dead who are not going to change, ever. Living persons
you should not allow in America. Because I am continuously growing, new
leaves will come, new flowers will come. Who knows? Anarchism,
communism...”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “You are a strange fellow! I am asking a simple thing, I am
not a philosopher.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I am also not a philosopher, but make a note that your
inquiry is applicable to a dead person only – not to a living person. If
you ask me this moment what I am, I can tell you. Next moment, nobody
knows what I will be. Even I don’t know. Then don’t call me
contradictory. I am a communist, I am an anarchist, and a little more.
Do you have any category?”</p><p><br></p><p>Gautam Buddha, twenty-five centuries back... I can add much more to
his teachings. These twenty- five centuries have not gone by in vain.
Consciousness has taken on new terms, has known new skies, has flown
farther than ever before. Because of this stupidity that you cannot add
anything, all the scriptures become dead.</p><p><br></p><p>I asked Anand Kausalyayan, “If Gautam Buddha himself had lived for
twenty-five centuries, do you think he would be saying the same
things?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “You are crazy, but rational. It is true. If he had lived
for twenty-five centuries, he would have added much.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Then it is my responsibility to add a few things here and
there. I take the liberty because I have tasted the same consciousness.
You have not tasted the consciousness – that’s why you are worried. You
know only the dead scripture, which died twenty-five centuries ago. I am
a living scripture.”</p><p><br></p><p>To realize the essence of Buddhism is to realize what Buddha
realized, is to go as deep into yourself as Buddha went in. That’s what
we are doing here. And we are not Buddhists, we don’t belong to any dead
tradition or any dead orthodoxy. There is no need. We are all carrying
the buddha within us – why go on searching anywhere else?</p><p><br></p><p>That is the purpose of zazen, to search through all the garbage that
you have accumulated down the centuries. You have been here on the earth
for four million years in different shapes, in different bodies, in
different species. You have gathered so much around your small buddha
that you will have to dig as deep as possible. And don’t waver in
digging.</p><p><br></p><p>One great Sufi mystic, Jalaluddin Rumi, one day took his disciples to
a field where a farmer had been trying for months to dig a well. The
disciples were feeling a little reluctant – what is the point</p><p>in going there? Whatever he wants to say, he can say here. But
Jalaluddin insisted: “You come with me. Without coming you will not
understand.”</p><p><br></p><p>What the farmer had done was, he would start digging in one place, go
ten feet, twelve feet, would not find water and would start digging in
another place. He had dug eight holes and now he was working on the
ninth. He had destroyed the whole field.</p><p><br></p><p>Rumi told his disciples, “Don’t be like this idiot. If he had put all
this energy into digging one hole he would have found water, howsoever
deep it is. He has wasted his energy unnecessarily.”</p><p><br></p><p>And that’s what everybody is doing. You start, you go a little bit,
and then you start again sometime later, or some years later. You go a
little bit from a different direction.</p><p><br></p><p>These little bits are dangerous. Your effort should be concentrated,
and once you start, and you have a master in whom you can trust and in
whom you can see the realization of a buddha, then there is no going
back. Then go on digging, even if it takes thirty years.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what Joshu is saying:</p><p><br></p><p>IN THE COURSE OF THREE, FIVE, TWENTY OR THIRTY YEARS, IF YOU FAIL TO
GRASP THE WAY, YOU MAY CUT OFF MY HEAD AND MAKE IT INTO A LADLE TO DRAW
URINE WITH.</p><p><br></p><p>I promise you, at the risk of my head, that if you continue... one
never knows. Three years, five years, twenty years, thirty years – one
never knows how much garbage you have gathered. Sometimes it can happen
in a single moment. Sometimes it can take years. It all depends on the
thickness of the layers of dust, past memories, future aspirations, and
how courageous you are to cut the whole thing in a single blow.</p><p><br></p><p>Without any rest, go on digging. The water is certainly everywhere;
so is the buddha-consciousness in every living being. Only man is so
fortunate that he can understand it. Other animals are also on the
way.…</p><p><br></p><p>Scientists think that the theory of evolution is Charles Darwin’s
concept. In the scientific field it is true, but they are not aware of
the Eastern concept of evolution. A very different concept – far more
relevant and far more valid. It is not that one monkey simply becomes
man. It is very difficult. You can force him, massage him, stretch him,
operate on his tail, put his tie right, but a monkey is a monkey. I
don’t think that suddenly one day some monkey got the idea, jumped out
of the tree, stood on his two feet, and started becoming man. If so, all
the other monkeys would have become man. They don’t become, they are
still there in the trees.</p><p><br></p><p>The East does not mean by evolution that a monkey becomes a man, but
the consciousness of a monkey may be born into a human being. It is not
the body that evolves; it is the consciousness within that goes on
taking higher forms, goes on reaching towards higher peaks. Man up to
now is the highest peak of all that the animals have been trying to be,
unconsciously. This is the fortunate situation for man, that he can do
consciously some work that other animals cannot do.</p><p><br></p><p>It is impossible to teach meditation to a buffalo, although buffalos
look more meditative than man. But nothing can be taught, and even if
there are a few birds, or a few animals who can be taught a</p><p>few tricks, that does not become their evolution. They simply become
actors. A few animals have the capacity to imitate, but only to imitate.
Neither can they add anything nor can they delete anything.</p><p><br></p><p>I told Anand Kausalyayan, “You are old, but still it is not too late.
The essence of Buddhism is not in the Buddhist scriptures, the essence
of Buddhism is in being a buddha.” And one becomes a buddha if he
reaches his own center.</p><p><br></p><p>Joshu is completely certain; otherwise he would not have made such a
statement: IN THE COURSE OF THREE, FIVE, TWENTY OR THIRTY YEARS...
because in thirty years he became enlightened. He thinks, “If a man like
me can become a buddha, then anybody can become. There are more
intelligent people than me, more courageous people than me. Somebody may
become in three years, somebody in five years.”</p><p><br></p><p>The question of time is irrelevant. The real thing is to begin now,
don’t postpone for tomorrow. Deeper somewhere, there is a life source –
that much is certain. You are alive, you are breathing, you are
listening, your heart is beating. You are perfectly alive, so there must
be a source from where life is coming to you. This much can be said with
an absolute guarantee, that you are connected with the universe and that
connection is your buddhahood.</p><p><br></p><p>JOSHU IS ALSO REPORTED TO HAVE SAID:</p><p><br></p><p>THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ARE ONLY SEEKERS AFTER BUDDHA, BUT
NOT A SINGLE ONE IS A TRUE MAN OF TAO.</p><p><br></p><p>To be a seeker in a lukewarm way, thinking that buddhahood is
certain...”If I don’t work it out today, there is tomorrow.” The seeker
without an urgency – there are thousands of people around the world.
There are even more cases now than at the time of Joshu – there are
millions of people who have a certain idea that one day they will turn
inwards, but that day has not come yet. There are so many other things
to be done. There are always, there have always been thousands of people
interested, but not interested enough to risk their whole life. And
unless you risk your whole life, unless it becomes such an urgency that
it has to be done whatever the consequences – whatsoever the losses, you
have to know yourself – unless this becomes such a total thirst, you
will not become a buddha. Or a man of Tao – which are not two things; a
man of Tao is the Chinese expression for the same experience as becoming
a buddha.</p><p><br></p><p>BEFORE THE EXISTENCE OF THE WORLD THE SELF-NATURE REMAINS INTACT. NOW
THAT</p><p>YOU HAVE SEEN THIS OLD MONK – Joshu is pointing at himself. NOW THAT
YOU HAVE SEEN THIS OLD MONK, YOU ARE NO LONGER SOMEONE ELSE, BUT A
MASTER OF YOURSELF. If</p><p>you have seen me clearly, you have seen yourself clearly, because I
am nothing but a mirror. Only a blind man can pass without seeing
himself in me, his own image.</p><p><br></p><p>The master’s basic, fundamental function is to be a mirror to the
disciple so the disciple can have a certain idea of what a man of Tao
means, what it means to be a buddha.</p><p><br></p><p>Joshu, with a lion’s roar, is saying, “When you have seen this old
monk, you are no longer someone else but a master of yourself.” A master
only reflects your masterhood. He reflects your potentiality, he
reflects what originally you are and you have forgotten.</p><p>WHAT IS THE USE OF SEEKING ANOTHER IN THE EXTERIOR?</p><p><br></p><p>Joshu is saying, “If you cannot see the buddha in me, then don’t
waste your time. You will not be able to see it anywhere.” This
certainty comes with self-experience.</p><p><br></p><p>I have called this book JOSHU – THE LION’S ROAR. Normally, buddhas
are very humble. Joshu is also very humble but he cannot help but say
with absolute authority that “once you have seen me, you have looked
into a mirror. If you cannot find your master here, then you will be
wasting your time wandering around the world, and you will think that
you are a seeker. There is no need to seek; just see that you are
fortunate to have come across a master.”</p><p><br></p><p>This authority arises out of absolute experience.</p><p><br></p><p>ONCE A MONK ASKED JOSHU, “WHAT IS YOUR FAMILY’S TRADITION?”</p><p><br></p><p>By “family” is not meant the ordinary family; by “family” is meant
your master, your master’s master. Once you have become a buddha, you
are reborn. Now there is no question of your ordinary family, your
ordinary parents. Your master has become the one closest to you. Your
master has become a rebirth for you. So, “WHAT IS YOUR FAMILY’S
TRADITION?” someone asked Joshu.</p><p><br></p><p>JOSHU RESPONDED... and you have to learn how these Zen masters
respond, they don’t reply. They don’t repeat. Their response... perhaps
the questioner has never dreamt that somebody will respond to his
question in this way.</p><p><br></p><p>JOSHU RESPONDED: “I HAVE NOTHING INSIDE, AND I SEEK FOR NOTHING
OUTSIDE. This is</p><p>the tradition of my family. Inside, an empty heart asking for
nothing. Outside, no desire, no ambition. This is the tradition of my
family.”</p><p><br></p><p>This is the tradition of all the buddhas. This has to become your
tradition too. Ryushu, a Zen poet, wrote:</p><p>THREE, TWO, ONE; ONE, TWO, THREE – HOW ARE YOU EVER GOING TO PROBE
THE MYSTERIES OF ZEN?</p><p>SPRING BIRDS BUSY ON MY ROOF AFTER THE RAIN</p><p>TRY OUT SOME NEW SOUNDS, TWEETING AND CHIRPING.</p><p>What does Ryushu mean by THREE, TWO, ONE? Man begins either from the
concept of three... just like the Hindu trimurti, three faces of God, or
like the Christian trinity. The words ‘trinity’ and</p><p>‘trimurti’ both come from the same root, tri. The word ‘three’ comes
from tri. Either one can begin from three – the knower, the known and
the knowledge, the seeker, the sought and the search – or one can begin
in a contrary way: ONE, TWO, THREE. One can start from oneself; then he
finds the other, he witnesses it. The other can be anything in your
inner experience. And then the third: the third is the very witnessing.
The one who witnesses, the other, which is witnessed, and the process of
witnessing is the third.</p><p><br></p><p>Ryushu is saying: Whatever you do, this way or that, you will not
reach to the ultimate. These are all games, which philosophers tend to
play. It is better not to get involved in games of spirituality, but
just be silent and watch what is happening around you.</p><p><br></p><p>SPRING BIRDS BUSY ON MY ROOF AFTER THE RAIN – watch these small
things, the rain and the mist that it has left behind, and the fragrance
that comes from the earth. And the birds who are busy on the roof – they
are trying NEW SOUNDS, TWEETING AND CHIRPING. Ryushu is saying there is
no need to be very serious about the search. You can become a witness of
ordinary things – the witnessing is the same, whether you witness a bird
chirping or you witness your mind chattering. Whether you witness a
sunrise outside or you witness your innermost being, witnessing is the
same.</p><p><br></p><p>Ryushu is saying, rather than getting involved in controversial
philosophies, start from small things. Learn from small things one art –
the art of witnessing. And then use that same art inwards. It is easier
to learn it in the outside world.</p><p><br></p><p>It is because of this that Zen became a very artistic religion. No
other religion is so artistic: their monasteries are beautiful gardens,
with beautiful ponds, birds, great trees, thick forests, mountains...
and all this is for zazen. You sit under an ancient tree and nothing has
to be done: just watch.</p><p><br></p><p>You know the famous haikus:</p><p><br></p><p>SITTING SILENTLY, DOING NOTHING, SPRING COMES</p><p>AND THE GRASS GROWS BY ITSELF. ANCIENT POND,</p><p>A FROG JUMPS IN THE SOUND</p><p>– of the frog,</p><p><br></p><p>and then the great silence. And you are just sitting by the side of
an ancient tree.</p><p><br></p><p>Zen has made the spiritual search very aesthetic. First learn it from
outside, watching the flowers and the sunrise and the sunset. The effort
is not concerned with the object, the effort is to learn</p><p>the art of watching without any interpretation, without any judgment.
A non-judgmental, mirror-like witnessing... if you have learned it from
outside, it will be easy for you to enter in with the same art.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 1 Maneesha has asked:</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>IT SEEMS YOU HAVE CLOSED OFF ALL ESCAPE ROUTES FOR US. AM I RIGHT IN
FEELING THAT ENLIGHTENMENT IS LESS AND LESS AN OPTION, BUT, RATHER, THE
ONLY EXIT?</p><p><br></p><p>It is the only exit, Maneesha. It is not an option. You cannot avoid
it. You can delay, you can postpone for centuries, but finally you will
end up a buddha – so why unnecessarily wait? That’s how I became a
buddha. When I saw that one has to become a buddha, this life or another
life... when this has to happen, then why unnecessarily waste time? I
simply dropped the idea of searching for Buddha and became a buddha.</p><p><br></p><p>The family in which I used to live at that time were suddenly
surprised. They said “You are behaving very strangely!”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I have to. Last night I became a buddha.”</p><p><br></p><p>They said, “This is not a joking matter... are you serious?” I said,
“I have to be!”</p><p>They shrugged their shoulders, they said, “But how did you become a
buddha?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “That is not the question. Once I understood that it is the
destiny of every living being, last night I thought: Why unnecessarily
wait?”</p><p><br></p><p>And since then, if I have tried to take even one holiday... It is not
allowed. Once you have become a buddha, I warn you, then there are no
holidays. Once a buddha, forever a buddha.</p><p><br></p><p>So Maneesha you are right, but it is not me who has closed all the
routes, it is existence itself. It gives you as much rope as you want.
But why unnecessarily remain miserable? Why unnecessarily remain in
anguish? If you can become a buddha and have all the blessings of
existence available to you, then why not this moment? It is not me, it
is existence itself asking you, “Why not this moment?”</p><p><br></p><p>Look at Zareen: she has come back to her place, has thrown away her
migraine last night, and is again sitting behind Maneesha. Beware of
Maneesha! because migraine is her old habit. She may throw it any
moment. And it is very easy when the gibberish starts – everybody is
throwing all kinds of bullshit. So remember one thing: go on throwing
your bullshit with your mouth, and with your hands go on protecting
yourself. Otherwise, only bullshit is exchanged and you go happy to your
home thinking that it was great.</p><p>A little change is good. But it is somebody else’s bullshit, so
remember it: when you are deeply involved in throwing all your nonsense,
keep protecting your mind with both your hands; otherwise you may get
new rubbish, new rotten eggs, but you will remain the same. So be
clever. Forcibly move away everything that is being thrown to you.</p><p><br></p><p>Maneesha, existence does not allow any option except enlightenment.
It goes on forcing you towards enlightenment. It has infinite time
available to it, so it is not in a hurry. But you should understand –
what is the point of postponing it for tomorrow? That is what Buddha
used to say: tathata, thisness, suchness, herenow – try to see a simple
point that you are a buddha. And a mirror is in front of you! If a
master cannot be a mirror to you, then either the master is not a
master, or you are blind.</p><p><br></p><p>Just a few days ago Hasya had gone to New Delhi for a press
conference. She was showing a small video there about the ashram and its
activities. She was very much puzzled that the journalists who had come,
when I started speaking, started looking... somebody this way, somebody
that way, somebody downwards. She could not understand what was the
matter. Then the Delhi friends told her, “You don’t know, they all think
that even to look into the eyes of this man is dangerous, or to hear his
voice. You will be hypnotized.”</p><p><br></p><p>Thousands of people want to come here. But they will come only when I
am dead, because then I cannot hypnotize them. Then they will bring
flowers and offerings, too. Right now it is dangerous. And you know it
is dangerous! Even though I am hiding my eyes, it does not matter. The
energy that hypnotizes passes through the glasses. Just last night,
Avirbhava and Anando have shown you: the energy knows no barrier. I have
started wearing these glasses just to console people, so they can look
towards me without fear – and I am going to do whatever I am supposed to
do!</p><p><br></p><p>It is existence itself that brings you to a master. It is your own
urge that impels you towards a master. There is no exit. Even if you go
far away from me, it will not make any difference; I will haunt you
wherever you go.</p><p><br></p><p>Zareen had gone to her house, but I haunted her there. In the morning
she was back. I inquired of Anando, “Just look to see whether Zareen is
back on the gate or not.” She said, “Why?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I have been haunting her the whole night! I hope that she is
well enough and back at the gate where she is needed.”</p><p><br></p><p>Once you have become part of my caravan there is no way out, there is
only a way in.</p><p><br></p><p>Now Sardar Gurudayal Singh is repressing his desire. He wants to
laugh even while I am speaking. But he has to suppress it because it
will be very embarrassing, particularly for an old disciple. So he keeps
suppressing it and waiting for his time. And his time comes.…</p><p><br></p><p>Pope the Polack dies and goes to heaven. He is met at the Pearly
Gates by Saint Peter, who asks the Polack if he has any questions before
he comes in.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, I have,” replies the pope. “I always knew that I would go to
heaven, but I often wondered what hell would be like.”</p><p>“Okay,” says Saint Peter. “You can visit hell if you want. But you
must return after half an hour, or you will get stuck there.”</p><p><br></p><p>So the Polack pope takes the elevator down to hell and finds himself
in the lobby of a luxury hotel. He looks around and sees it is a beach
resort, with beautiful men and women lazing around in the sun. There is
a well-stocked bar, where the drinks are free, and a magnificent spread
of multi-national food. A Brazilian band is playing a hot Samba, and
everything is just far out!</p><p><br></p><p>The Polack wanders around in rapture for a while and then notices
that his half an hour is nearly up. He makes a dash for the elevator and
only just gets back in time.</p><p><br></p><p>The pope walks through the gates of heaven just as Saint Peter
announces that lunch is ready. So the Polack pope sits himself down at
the table.</p><p><br></p><p>After a few moments they are joined by Jesus, who brings in a plate
of peanut butter sandwiches and a pot of herb tea.</p><p><br></p><p>“What is this?” cries the Polack, in dismay. “Down in hell, they eat
pizza and ice cream, and drink French wine!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well,” replies Saint Peter, “it’s not worth putting on a fancy
spread for just the three of us!”</p><p><br></p><p>Young Spud Kowalski wins a fortune in the Polish National Lottery.
When he comes home that evening, he finds his dad, Kowalski, sitting in
front of the TV.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hi, Dad!” he says. “Guess what? I won the lottery today.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I know,” says Kowalski, “I just saw it on the TV. Fifty thousand
dollars!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, Dad,” says Spud, “you and mom have been so good to me over the
years that I have decided to give you a cut. Here Dad, take ten
dollars.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Wow! Thanks, son,” says Kowalski, examining the ten dollar bill
carefully. “And now, let me give you some good advice.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay Dad,” says Spud. “I’m listening.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Son,” continues Kowalski, “don’t just waste your good fortune.
Settle down and get married properly – not like your mother and me.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Gee Dad!” cries Spud. “You mean you and mom never got married? Do
you realize what that makes me?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sure I do, son,” snaps Kowalski. “And you’re a real tight one,
too!”</p><p>Three sailors – a German, an American and a Polack – are in a pub
drinking a few beers. “Our submarines can stay under water for a half a
year,” brags the German sailor.</p><p>“That’s nothing,” says the American, swallowing his beer and wiping
his lips. “Our nuclear submarines can stay under water for one whole
year!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hey,” says the Polack sailor, spilling his beer. “That is really
nothing. Our submarines dive down and never come up!”</p><p><br></p><p>Nivedano... (Drumbeat) (Gibberish) (Drumbeat)</p><p>Be silent. Close your eyes, feel your body to be completely
frozen.</p><p><br></p><p>Now look inwards, gathering all your consciousness – almost like an
arrow, forcing towards the center.</p><p><br></p><p>At the center you are the buddha. On the circumference you may be
anybody, Tom, Dick, Harry; on the circumference you are all different
but at the center your essential nature is that of a buddha, the man of
Tao.</p><p><br></p><p>Deeper and deeper – because the deeper you go, the more will be your
experience of your eternal reality. Flowers will start showering on you,
the whole existence will rejoice your silence.</p><p><br></p><p>Just be a witness, from the center, and you have arrived home. To
make it clear, Nivedano...</p><p>(Drumbeat)</p><p><br></p><p>Relax. Just remember that you are only a witness. The body is not
you, the mind is not you. You are just a mirror.</p><p><br></p><p>And as you settle down into a mirror-like witnessing, the whole
existence takes on a tremendously beautiful form. Everything becomes
divine.</p><p><br></p><p>This evening was beautiful on its own, but Joshu’s lion’s roar has
made it tremendously beautiful. This very moment you are a buddha.</p><p>When you come back, bring the buddha with you. You have to live out
the buddha in your day-to-day life. I am against renouncing the world –
I am for recreating the world. The more buddhas there are, the world
will have new skies, new dimensions, new doors opening... new mysteries,
new miracles.</p><p><br></p><p>Collect as much fragrance and flowers as you can.</p><p>Nivedano... (Drumbeat)</p><p>Come back, but come back as a buddha – peacefully, gracefully. Sit
down for a few moments just to recollect your experience of the space
that you have visited and the splendor that you have experienced.</p><p><br></p><p>Every day you have to go deeper and deeper.</p><p><br></p><p>So always remember how far you have gone: tomorrow you have to go a
little more. It may take two, or five, or twenty, or thirty years – but
you are to become a buddha. As far as I am concerned you are right now a
buddha, you have only to gain courage.</p><p><br></p><p>In those thirty years you will not be changing into a buddha – you
are a buddha already. Those thirty years are just to drop the doubt, the
doubt that you – how can you be a buddha? Even if I say it, even if all
the buddhas try to convince you, deep down is the doubt: “My god, me?
and a buddha?” But one day you will become convinced by your own
experience. There is no real conversion without your own experience.</p><p><br></p><p>And Maneesha, I am not allowing you any exit. You have been out for
centuries.</p><p>Now you have to go in.</p><p><br></p><p>Okay, Maneesha?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, Osho.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part3>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

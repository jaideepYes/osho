In the ordinary sleep you become unconscious. In yoganidra you still retain your consciousness, you still remain alert. You know that you are fast asleep, but that knowing remains. You know that the body is changing its posture. Deep down a small light of awareness still continues. That type of sleep is called yoganidra. And that is going to be your method. That has to be worked out...\nEach night when you go to sleep, go with this idea in the mind – that soon you will become able to be alert in sleep. It will take two, three months. Then one day suddenly you will know that you were deep asleep and still there was a kind of consciousness hovering around it, you knew it. The day it happens you have to report to me.\nThis is something tremendously valuable. Once it happens things become very simple. Because deep sleep is the easiest way to drop the body, to forget the body. It is the easiest way to know that you are not the body. While awake, we are more identified with the body.\nIn the yoga sutras of Patanjali he defines samadhi as deep sleep with awareness. That is the only difference between samadhi and deep sleep. In deep sleep everybody moves into a kind of samadhi – but unconsciously. So the benefit is there: if you have slept deeply without any dreams, in the morning you feel the freshness, the vitality, the rest, the relaxation that the night has given to you. On some other occasion you have been dreaming the whole night and by the morning you have slept for eight hours but something is missing. You are still disoriented, you are not settled.\nJust the other day I was reading a small anecdote.… A father is waking his son, a small boy, in the morning, saying ‘Get up! You have to go to the school.’ The boy turns over and he says, ‘I am feeling very tired.’ The father says ‘Nonsense – because after sleeping for at least ten hours nobody feels tired. What are you talking about?’ ‘Just now I have been participating in a ten-mile race in my dream,’ the boy explains. ‘I am feeling very tired!’\nIt actually happens: if dreams have been there, in the morning you are tired. Whether you participate in a real ten-mile race or in a dream, both affect you.\nPatanjali says that if one can sleep with awareness, then in that awareness one comes to know that the body is absolutely another world. You are a separate reality: you are in the body but you are not the body. The body is your shrine, your abode, but you are not it. It has to be respected, it has to be loved, but one should not get identified with it. If one gets identified with the body one loses the real perspective of being eternal, immortal, timeless. Then it is as if you are looking into the sky from a window and you get identified with the window; you start thinking that you are the window. It is exactly the same case with the body.\nYou are looking through the eyes but you are not the eyes; the eyes are only the windows. You are listening through the ears but you are not your ears; your ears are only the windows. And so it is with your hands and all the senses. You are deep somewhere inside.\nThe awareness of that inner core is easiest in deep sleep. And it will be easy for you; that’s why I am giving you the name. Good!\nAnand means bliss, manohara means beauty. And you are carrying a great seed of beauty within you, still unsprouted... great energy that can explode in a great dance. Whatsoever you have done up to now has helped a little bit but the potential is much more, so don’t be satisfied with it. Create a great discontent. Otherwise what happens is that people live nearabout ten percent of their potential, not more than that. Ninety percent is simply wasted, goes down the drain. The more potential a person has, the more he will lose. The more potential a person has, the more he will feel a kind of frustration in life unless he fulfills the potential.\nYou are carrying a great treasure. It has to be explored. It is difficult, it is dangerous to go into it. That’s why people cling to the shore; they don’t go into the ocean. By and by they forget the ocean; they start living on the shore. They become beggars. They lose contact with their own kingdom.\nThese two things you have to remember: bliss and beauty. You have to become more and more aesthetic, sensitive – to colours, to forms, to sounds, to the music that surrounds the earth... the music that fills the whole universe and the music that is within you. Feel more and more in tune with it. Explore, innovate, and never be satisfied. There is always something more that can be done. Only then does one come to the point one day where the flower has bloomed in its utterness. And that’s what god is.\nGod is not something like an object that one day you encounter. God is your potential come to a flowering; god is your being realised. God is not a separate entity, god is not sitting somewhere. God has to be created, and everybody has to create his own god. My god will not be your god... can’t be; it will be a borrowed god. Jesus’ god cannot be your god. Jesus explores his being, gives birth to that god. You will have to explore your being and give birth to your god.\nEverybody has to become a womb, and unless you give birth to god, it remains just a theory, a dogma, a belief.\n[A sannyasin who is leaving asks if there is a particular meditation he should do. He likes Nadabrahma best.]\nNadabrahma? Then you continue Nadabrahma, mm? Always remember, whatsoever you enjoy can go deep in you; only that can go deep in you. Enjoying it simply means it fits with you. The rhythm of it falls in tune with you: there is a subtle harmony between you and the method.\nOnce you enjoy a method then don’t become greedy; go into that method as much as you can. You can do it once at least or if possible, twice a day. The more you do it, the more you will enjoy it. Only drop a method when the joy has disappeared; then its work is finished. Search for another method. No method can lead you to the very end. On the journey you will have to change trains many times. A certain method takes you to a certain state. Beyond that it is of no more use, it is spent.\nSo two things have to be remembered: when you are enjoying a method go into it as deeply as possible but never become addicted to it, because one day you will have to drop it too. If you become too much addicted to it then it is like a drug; you cannot leave it. You no more enjoy it – it is not giving you anything – but it has become a habit. Then one can continue it, but one is moving in circles; it cannot lead beyond that.\nSo let joy be the criterion. If joy is there, continue, to the last bit of joy go on. It has to be squeezed totally. No juice should be left behind... not even a single drop. And then be capable of dropping it. Choose some other method that again brings the joy. Many times a person has to change. It varies with different people but it is very rare that one method will do the whole journey. So right now continue nadabrahma.\n[A sannyasin, newly arrived has been assigned groups.]\nRemember one word continuously while you are here: that is ‘yes’. Don’t allow a ‘no’ to settle anywhere. Don’t allow it any entry; then much will be possible. Yes makes all things possible so be in the mood of yes. Even when sometimes your intellect says no, in spite of that go on saying yes and immense will be the benefit. The whole chemistry changes with yes. With no you have one chemistry; with yes a totally different chemistry. With no you are fighting against existence. With no you are an ego. With yes you disappear: only existence is.\nWith yes you are a religious person. With yes there is nothing impossible; with no there is nothing possible. The person who lives in a no lives in a citadel, behind iron walls. The person living in a no lives in his grave already. No goes on poisoning everything: it poisons love, it poisons trust, it poisons surrender; it poisons everything!\nYes purifies. Yes is the philosopher’s stone: any baser metal can be simply transformed into gold by touching it. So keep that in mind.\n[A sannyasin says he’s been involved in work in Esalen, Arica and Gurdjieff work. Osho says, good preparation. He checks the sannyasin’s energy, and says that his intelligence is functioning perfectly\nwell but love hasn’t yet started growing. And love and intelligence should grow together, adds Osho, otherwise there is an imbalance]\nThat is one of the problems with Gurdjieff work: it does not believe in love at all. It is just pure effort to awaken intelligence, remembrance. Good, because there is something immensely valuablebut\nsomething is missing ill it.\nBuddha had said that unless meditation and compassion go together nothing is possible. Compassion alone can grow much. That’s what christian mystics have been doing: just compassion, service, humanity, this and that. Compassion grows but meditation is missing. Through Gurdjieff’s work meditation grows, concentration grows, self-remembering grows, but compassion is missing.\nSo you have come in the right moment; your heart can be opened. And once your heart starts growing then you will see how they both balance each other and what benediction happens when they are in utter balance. Then there is bliss. Bliss is balance.\n[Osho suggests groups for him.]\nThese three... and then I will tell you what else to do, mm? Much has to be done – and you are ready in many ways. Just a few things here and there, final touches, and the quality of the painting is changed completely. Sometimes a single stroke of the brush and the painting becomes a masterpiece, but one has to know exactly where the stroke is needed.\nI have heard a story about a great factory that had to be closed because something went wrong; it was fully automatic, the factory. The expert was called; he had to come from a faraway country. He came and with a small hammer he simply hit a certain place and the mechanism started humming again. It was almost a miracle!\nThe owner was very thankful, but the expert demanded ten thousand dollars. The man said, ‘Are you joking or what? You have not done anything at all; you have just hit with your hammer! Just for a single hit, ten thousand dollars is too much.’ The expert said, ‘As far as the hit is concerned, for that I am charging only one dollar. But where to hit? – for that I am charging the remainder!’\nSometimes one can go on groping, not knowing where to hit. But all your groping in the past has been beneficial. It has not been a waste; it has given you something. And once the right place is hit everything will fall into one whole.\n[The teenage daughter of the previous sannyasin is present, says he plays the father with her too much.]\n(To the father) I think she may be right! She may be right. She says that she resents your advice, and she feels that you are trying to be too much of a father. That is possible, mm? – because you must be thinking to compensate for the mother too. (to the daughter) That is very natural because he is functioning as both father and mother.\n[She answers: My mother is here.]\nNo, but you were not with your mother. You have been living with [your father], so he has to function in both ways – as a mother, as a father; that can be too much. That can be very problematic.\n(to the father) So now do one thing: while you are here, for three months give her complete freedom, complete freedom. If she wants something, help her, otherwise leave her. Let her float, do whatsoever she wants to do, and that will be great... for you both. (to the daughter) Because his desire is to help you but sometimes children resent that very much. Nobody wants to be helped because it makes you feel helpless – that you cannot do anything on your own. And this is the time, the age, when the child wants to become independent and wants to say no. You want to do something which shows that you are independent, no more a child.\n(addressing the father) So if you advise her, the only result will be that she will go against the advice. Don’t advise; for three months leave her. I will look after her. (to the daughter) So for three months be completely free and do whatsoever you always wanted to do, right. And then we settle, mm? – then we will see what can be done.\n[A sannyasin says she has done some mind type groups in the West.]\nNow I will give you some no-mind work. And I have the key – don’t be worried. The lock is going to be opened. Just cooperate with me. Good!\n[The Vipassana group which is here tonight. One participant says: There’s always joy and sadness and a lot of anger sometimes; I feel much hate. They all come together and become mixed. In vipassana it was very strong.]\n... And were there some moments when it disappeared too or did it remain all the time? [She answers: Two or three times it disappeared but that was only for a very short time.]\nThen there is no problem. Just do one thing: start becoming a witness to the whole chaos that comes. Just watch it; there is no need to figure out what it was. There is no need to be worried that the sadness and the happiness and the fear are all mixed. Let them be mixed; let it be a cloud of all kinds of things. Just be there far away looking at it. It is not you; that has to be remembered. It is just the mind overflooded with all kinds of repressed emotions.\nSomething has broken in you; it is going to become a break-through. Right now it will look like a breakdown. Some layer has broken, something that was keeping things separate is no more there, so things have become mixed up. But it is good that they are coming up, surfacing. Anything that surfaces is released from the system, and if you can just remain a witness, not doing anything – just looking at it with no judgement, with no idea at all whether this is good or bad, whether it should be or should not be... Let it be, whatsoever it is. No need to say good, bad – don’t label it, don’t verbalise.\nJust go on sitting there looking at it silently and soon you will see that those moments when there is no chaos, no sadness, no fear, no happiness, will come more and more. Those moments will be the first glimpses into your being, into your self-nature. Something immensely valuable is happening but you can miss if you get too much involved in it and become worried. This is not the time to worry.\nThis is the time to witness, so from this moment try witnessing. Whenever you forget, and suddenly you remember that you have forgotten, there is no need to feel guilty about it, no need to become worried about why you forgot it. Forget that you forgot; again become a witness.\nSoon you will get in tune with witnessing.\n[A sannyasin, who is Indian and a film star, is in a very emotional state and says she is afraid, and tired of being so afraid.]\nBut you don’t listen to me! If I say something, you don’t do it. I wanted you to do a few groups – that will help immensely – but you don’t do that. I wanted you to get out of this relationship but you continue; you know that it is meaningless but you continue. So you are creating the whole mess around yourself.…\nFor example, I told you to do a few groups; you have not done them. They can bring things out. You need a good catharsis, that’s all. The fear will go, the crying will go, but you need a situation where it can be helped and brought out. Just sitting in your house you will be crying and weeping and afraid and this and that. That won’t help.\nIt is so simple. If you ask me, I prescribe some medicine and you don’t take it. Then what to do, mm? (a chuckle) You see people growing here, you see people changing here... but they listen to me! If I send them to some group they go; even If sometimes it is hard, they go. You want to change, you want to become more centred, more happy, but you don’t want to do anything for it! It cannot happen that way. Either accept it as it is... then stop crying and weeping for it; this is your fate. Accept it! Or some effort has to be done.\nAnd you can grow out of it; it is very simple. Thousands of people are getting out of these problems, but if you want to protect those problems then it is up to you. I cannot force you. There too it seems there is fear. You don’t want to grow either because you are afraid that if you grow things will change!\nJust think about it. What can be done? You are afraid that if you go into encounter you will come to realise that you are in a foolish relationship; that fear is there. If you come to see that it is a silly relationship and it is creating trouble, then what will you do? So it is better not to see. You are keeping your eyes closed so that you cannot see the enemy and you can believe that he is not. But you know that he is; that’s why you are keeping your eyes closed.\nYou are like a person who will not go to the doctor because he is afraid he may have cancer. But not going to the doctor not going to help! You can go on saying ‘Why should I go to the doctor? – I am perfectly healthy!’... but you know that you are not.\nProblems are very simple but they need some treatment, they need some process. I cannot just take your fear out. You will have to be pounded so the fear can come out. And you can simply come out of it; it is not such a big problem as you are making it. You are magnifying it and making it very big. It seems you enjoy it being a big problem: ‘[I have] a big problem; not a small problem.’ Maybe you are afraid that if it is solved what will you do? Sometimes it happens: people cling to their misery because it is better than nothing. The fear may be of a deep emptiness, so anything – worry, depression, misery – anything is good. One feels full.\nIf you listen to me you can get out of it. Think about it. If you want to get out of it, then do whatsoever I say. If you don’t want to get out of it then...\n[Osho suggests she book for Encounter first, and then Tantra.]\nThese two you do. Just go with courage and don’t hide, because if you hide then it will... open yourself, open up completely. Be innocently open and these two groups will do much.\nIt will be hard for three, four days, and then things will start happening. You will come out of these things just dancing!\nAnd these are not punishments; you think these groups are punishments!...\nMm, frightening, but they are not punishments, mm? They are really awards, not punishments. Once you have gone into one or two groups, you will start asking for more!\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"3525","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/only_losers_can_win_in_this_game/part10/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/only_losers_can_win_in_this_game/>Only Losers Can Win in This Game</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">10 Make womb for god</h1><div class=post-meta>17 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;3525 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Only_Losers_Can_Win_in_This_Game/part10.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part9>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

any dreams, in the morning you feel the freshness, the vitality, the
rest, the relaxation that the night has given to you. On some other
occasion you have been dreaming the whole night and by the morning you
have slept for eight hours but something is missing. You are still
disoriented, you are not settled.</p><p><br></p><p>Just the other day I was reading a small anecdote.… A father is
waking his son, a small boy, in the morning, saying ‘Get up! You have to
go to the school.’ The boy turns over and he says, ‘I am feeling very
tired.’ The father says ‘Nonsense – because after sleeping for at least
ten hours nobody feels tired. What are you talking about?’ ‘Just now I
have been participating in a ten-mile race in my dream,’ the boy
explains. ‘I am feeling very tired!’</p><p><br></p><p>It actually happens: if dreams have been there, in the morning you
are tired. Whether you participate in a real ten-mile race or in a
dream, both affect you.</p><p><br></p><p>Patanjali says that if one can sleep with awareness, then in that
awareness one comes to know that the body is absolutely another world.
You are a separate reality: you are in the body but you are not the
body. The body is your shrine, your abode, but you are not it. It has to
be respected, it has to be loved, but one should not get identified with
it. If one gets identified with the body one loses the real perspective
of being eternal, immortal, timeless. Then it is as if you are looking
into the sky from a window and you get identified with the window; you
start thinking that you are the window. It is exactly the same case with
the body.</p><p><br></p><p>You are looking through the eyes but you are not the eyes; the eyes
are only the windows. You are listening through the ears but you are not
your ears; your ears are only the windows. And so it is with your hands
and all the senses. You are deep somewhere inside.</p><p><br></p><p>The awareness of that inner core is easiest in deep sleep. And it
will be easy for you; that’s why I am giving you the name. Good!</p><p><br></p><p>Anand means bliss, manohara means beauty. And you are carrying a
great seed of beauty within you, still unsprouted... great energy that
can explode in a great dance. Whatsoever you have done up to now has
helped a little bit but the potential is much more, so don’t be
satisfied with it. Create a great discontent. Otherwise what happens is
that people live nearabout ten percent of their potential, not more than
that. Ninety percent is simply wasted, goes down the drain. The more
potential a person has, the more he will lose. The more potential a
person has, the more he will feel a kind of frustration in life unless
he fulfills the potential.</p><p><br></p><p>You are carrying a great treasure. It has to be explored. It is
difficult, it is dangerous to go into it. That’s why people cling to the
shore; they don’t go into the ocean. By and by they forget the ocean;
they start living on the shore. They become beggars. They lose contact
with their own kingdom.</p><p><br></p><p>These two things you have to remember: bliss and beauty. You have to
become more and more aesthetic, sensitive – to colours, to forms, to
sounds, to the music that surrounds the earth... the music that fills
the whole universe and the music that is within you. Feel more and more
in tune with it. Explore, innovate, and never be satisfied. There is
always something more that can be done. Only then does one come to the
point one day where the flower has bloomed in its utterness. And that’s
what god is.</p><p><br></p><p>God is not something like an object that one day you encounter. God
is your potential come to a flowering; god is your being realised. God
is not a separate entity, god is not sitting somewhere. God has to be
created, and everybody has to create his own god. My god will not be
your god... can’t be; it will be a borrowed god. Jesus’ god cannot be
your god. Jesus explores his being, gives birth to that god. You will
have to explore your being and give birth to your god.</p><p><br></p><p>Everybody has to become a womb, and unless you give birth to god, it
remains just a theory, a dogma, a belief.</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin who is leaving asks if there is a particular meditation
he should do. He likes Nadabrahma best.]</p><p><br></p><p>Nadabrahma? Then you continue Nadabrahma, mm? Always remember,
whatsoever you enjoy can go deep in you; only that can go deep in you.
Enjoying it simply means it fits with you. The rhythm of it falls in
tune with you: there is a subtle harmony between you and the method.</p><p><br></p><p>Once you enjoy a method then don’t become greedy; go into that method
as much as you can. You can do it once at least or if possible, twice a
day. The more you do it, the more you will enjoy it. Only drop a method
when the joy has disappeared; then its work is finished. Search for
another method. No method can lead you to the very end. On the journey
you will have to change trains many times. A certain method takes you to
a certain state. Beyond that it is of no more use, it is spent.</p><p><br></p><p>So two things have to be remembered: when you are enjoying a method
go into it as deeply as possible but never become addicted to it,
because one day you will have to drop it too. If you become too much
addicted to it then it is like a drug; you cannot leave it. You no more
enjoy it – it is not giving you anything – but it has become a habit.
Then one can continue it, but one is moving in circles; it cannot lead
beyond that.</p><p><br></p><p>So let joy be the criterion. If joy is there, continue, to the last
bit of joy go on. It has to be squeezed totally. No juice should be left
behind... not even a single drop. And then be capable of dropping it.
Choose some other method that again brings the joy. Many times a person
has to change. It varies with different people but it is very rare that
one method will do the whole journey. So right now continue
nadabrahma.</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin, newly arrived has been assigned groups.]</p><p><br></p><p>Remember one word continuously while you are here: that is ‘yes’.
Don’t allow a ‘no’ to settle anywhere. Don’t allow it any entry; then
much will be possible. Yes makes all things possible so be in the mood
of yes. Even when sometimes your intellect says no, in spite of that go
on saying yes and immense will be the benefit. The whole chemistry
changes with yes. With no you have one chemistry; with yes a totally
different chemistry. With no you are fighting against existence. With no
you are an ego. With yes you disappear: only existence is.</p><p><br></p><p>With yes you are a religious person. With yes there is nothing
impossible; with no there is nothing possible. The person who lives in a
no lives in a citadel, behind iron walls. The person living in a no
lives in his grave already. No goes on poisoning everything: it poisons
love, it poisons trust, it poisons surrender; it poisons everything!</p><p><br></p><p>Yes purifies. Yes is the philosopher’s stone: any baser metal can be
simply transformed into gold by touching it. So keep that in mind.</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin says he’s been involved in work in Esalen, Arica and
Gurdjieff work. Osho says, good preparation. He checks the sannyasin’s
energy, and says that his intelligence is functioning perfectly</p><p><br></p><p>well but love hasn’t yet started growing. And love and intelligence
should grow together, adds Osho, otherwise there is an imbalance<span class=s4></span>]</p><p><br></p><p>That is one of the problems with Gurdjieff work: it does not believe
in love at all. It is just pure effort to awaken intelligence,
remembrance. Good, because there is something immensely valuable<span class=s4></span>but</p><p>something is missing ill it.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha had said that unless meditation and compassion go together
nothing is possible. Compassion alone can grow much. That’s what
christian mystics have been doing: just compassion, service, humanity,
this and that. Compassion grows but meditation is missing. Through
Gurdjieff’s work meditation grows, concentration grows, self-remembering
grows, but compassion is missing.</p><p><br></p><p>So you have come in the right moment; your heart can be opened. And
once your heart starts growing then you will see how they both balance
each other and what benediction happens when they are in utter balance.
Then there is bliss. Bliss is balance.</p><p><br></p><p>[Osho suggests groups for him.]</p><p><br></p><p>These three... and then I will tell you what else to do, mm? Much has
to be done – and you are ready in many ways. Just a few things here and
there, final touches, and the quality of the painting is changed
completely. Sometimes a single stroke of the brush and the painting
becomes a masterpiece, but one has to know exactly where the stroke is
needed.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard a story about a great factory that had to be closed
because something went wrong; it was fully automatic, the factory. The
expert was called; he had to come from a faraway country. He came and
with a small hammer he simply hit a certain place and the mechanism
started humming again. It was almost a miracle!</p><p><br></p><p>The owner was very thankful, but the expert demanded ten thousand
dollars. The man said, ‘Are you joking or what? You have not done
anything at all; you have just hit with your hammer! Just for a single
hit, ten thousand dollars is too much.’ The expert said, ‘As far as the
hit is concerned, for that I am charging only one dollar. But where to
hit? – for that I am charging the remainder!’</p><p><br></p><p>Sometimes one can go on groping, not knowing where to hit. But all
your groping in the past has been beneficial. It has not been a waste;
it has given you something. And once the right place is hit everything
will fall into one whole.</p><p><br></p><p>[The teenage daughter of the previous sannyasin is present, says he
plays the father with her too much.]</p><p><br></p><p>(To the father) I think she may be right! She may be right. She says
that she resents your advice, and she feels that you are trying to be
too much of a father. That is possible, mm? – because you must be
thinking to compensate for the mother too. (to the daughter) That is
very natural because he is functioning as both father and mother.</p><p><br></p><p>[She answers: My mother is here.]</p><p><br></p><p>No, but you were not with your mother. You have been living with
[your father], so he has to function in both ways – as a mother, as a
father; that can be too much. That can be very problematic.</p><p><br></p><p>(to the father) So now do one thing: while you are here, for three
months give her complete freedom, complete freedom. If she wants
something, help her, otherwise leave her. Let her float, do whatsoever
she wants to do, and that will be great... for you both. (to the
daughter) Because his desire is to help you but sometimes children
resent that very much. Nobody wants to be helped because it makes you
feel helpless – that you cannot do anything on your own. And this is the
time, the age, when the child wants to become independent and wants to
say no. You want to do something which shows that you are independent,
no more a child.</p><p><br></p><p>(addressing the father) So if you advise her, the only result will be
that she will go against the advice. Don’t advise; for three months
leave her. I will look after her. (to the daughter) So for three months
be completely free and do whatsoever you always wanted to do, right. And
then we settle, mm? – then we will see what can be done.</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin says she has done some mind type groups in the
West.]</p><p><br></p><p>Now I will give you some no-mind work. And I have the key – don’t be
worried. The lock is going to be opened. Just cooperate with me.
Good!</p><p><br></p><p>[The Vipassana group which is here tonight. One participant says:
There’s always joy and sadness and a lot of anger sometimes; I feel much
hate. They all come together and become mixed. In vipassana it was very
strong.]</p><p><br></p><p>... And were there some moments when it disappeared too or did it
remain all the time? [She answers: Two or three times it disappeared but
that was only for a very short time.]</p><p>Then there is no problem. Just do one thing: start becoming a witness
to the whole chaos that comes. Just watch it; there is no need to figure
out what it was. There is no need to be worried that the sadness and the
happiness and the fear are all mixed. Let them be mixed; let it be a
cloud of all kinds of things. Just be there far away looking at it. It
is not you; that has to be remembered. It is just the mind overflooded
with all kinds of repressed emotions.</p><p><br></p><p>Something has broken in you; it is going to become a break-through.
Right now it will look like a breakdown. Some layer has broken,
something that was keeping things separate is no more there, so things
have become mixed up. But it is good that they are coming up, surfacing.
Anything that surfaces is released from the system, and if you can just
remain a witness, not doing anything – just looking at it with no
judgement, with no idea at all whether this is good or bad, whether it
should be or should not be... Let it be, whatsoever it is. No need to
say good, bad – don’t label it, don’t verbalise.</p><p><br></p><p>Just go on sitting there looking at it silently and soon you will see
that those moments when there is no chaos, no sadness, no fear, no
happiness, will come more and more. Those moments will be the first
glimpses into your being, into your self-nature. Something immensely
valuable is happening but you can miss if you get too much involved in
it and become worried. This is not the time to worry.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the time to witness, so from this moment try witnessing.
Whenever you forget, and suddenly you remember that you have forgotten,
there is no need to feel guilty about it, no need to become worried
about why you forgot it. Forget that you forgot; again become a
witness.</p><p><br></p><p>Soon you will get in tune with witnessing.</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin, who is Indian and a film star, is in a very emotional
state and says she is afraid, and tired of being so afraid.]</p><p><br></p><p>But you don’t listen to me! If I say something, you don’t do it. I
wanted you to do a few groups – that will help immensely – but you don’t
do that. I wanted you to get out of this relationship but you continue;
you know that it is meaningless but you continue. So you are creating
the whole mess around yourself.…</p><p><br></p><p>For example, I told you to do a few groups; you have not done them.
They can bring things out. You need a good catharsis, that’s all. The
fear will go, the crying will go, but you need a situation where it can
be helped and brought out. Just sitting in your house you will be crying
and weeping and afraid and this and that. That won’t help.</p><p><br></p><p>It is so simple. If you ask me, I prescribe some medicine and you
don’t take it. Then what to do, mm? (a chuckle) You see people growing
here, you see people changing here... but they listen to me! If I send
them to some group they go; even If sometimes it is hard, they go. You
want to change, you want to become more centred, more happy, but you
don’t want to do anything for it! It cannot happen that way. Either
accept it as it is... then stop crying and weeping for it; this is your
fate. Accept it! Or some effort has to be done.</p><p><br></p><p>And you can grow out of it; it is very simple. Thousands of people
are getting out of these problems, but if you want to protect those
problems then it is up to you. I cannot force you. There too it seems
there is fear. You don’t want to grow either because you are afraid that
if you grow things will change!</p><p><br></p><p>Just think about it. What can be done? You are afraid that if you go
into encounter you will come to realise that you are in a foolish
relationship; that fear is there. If you come to see that it is a silly
relationship and it is creating trouble, then what will you do? So it is
better not to see. You are keeping your eyes closed so that you cannot
see the enemy and you can believe that he is not. But you know that he
is; that’s why you are keeping your eyes closed.</p><p><br></p><p>You are like a person who will not go to the doctor because he is
afraid he may have cancer. But not going to the doctor not going to
help! You can go on saying ‘Why should I go to the doctor? – I am
perfectly healthy!’... but you know that you are not.</p><p><br></p><p>Problems are very simple but they need some treatment, they need some
process. I cannot just take your fear out. You will have to be pounded
so the fear can come out. And you can simply come out of it; it is not
such a big problem as you are making it. You are magnifying it and
making it very big. It seems you enjoy it being a big problem: ‘[I have]
a big problem; not a small problem.’ Maybe you are afraid that if it is
solved what will you do? Sometimes it happens: people cling to their
misery because it is better than nothing. The fear may be of a deep
emptiness, so anything – worry, depression, misery – anything is good.
One feels full.</p><p><br></p><p>If you listen to me you can get out of it. Think about it. If you
want to get out of it, then do whatsoever I say. If you don’t want to
get out of it then...</p><p><br></p><p>[Osho suggests she book for Encounter first, and then Tantra.]</p><p><br></p><p>These two you do. Just go with courage and don’t hide, because if you
hide then it will... open yourself, open up completely. Be innocently
open and these two groups will do much.</p><p><br></p><p>It will be hard for three, four days, and then things will start
happening. You will come out of these things just dancing!</p><p><br></p><p>And these are not punishments; you think these groups are
punishments!...</p><p><br></p><p>Mm, frightening, but they are not punishments, mm? They are really
awards, not punishments. Once you have gone into one or two groups, you
will start asking for more!</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part9>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

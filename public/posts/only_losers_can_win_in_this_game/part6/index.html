To be in that state one has to be possessed by god. One has to lose oneself more and more, one’s ideas, one’s mind, one’s manipulations, one’s control.\nThere can be two orders in a human being. Either man orders himself – he is his own government – or god becomes his government and he simply follows. Misery comes when you try to control life. Misery is just an indicatyion that you are trying to control life which cannot be controlled, hence misery. You are pushing the river: it is doomed to fail.\nMan is a part and the whole is really so big; we cannot push the whole. The very effort creates a conflict. In that conflict man can never win. And it is good that he can never win. God always wins. And if you want to win, drop fighting. You can win only with god, never against him.\nThat is the meaning of suraj: you leave all in the divine hands. And then one is surprised how things which had never been settled before when one had tried so hard, start settling. One is surprised by seeing how things start moving smoothly. The old struggle is no more there. It is more like floating down with the stream, not fighting upstream. It is a let-go. And when you are not, god is.\nThe whole idea of sannyas is to help you disappear, to help you evaporate. When you are not there and the emptiness is, in that very emptiness the divine enters. Then you become a vehicle. You are charged with immense energy and power... but it is nothing to brag about. You are just a hollow bamboo, and the song is of the divine.\nSo let this be my message for your sannyas – that you have to disappear and make space for god. In your very disappearance is your victory.…\nDeva means divine, wirla means unique: divine uniqueness. And that’s how I see everybody: everybody is unique. Nobody is common and nobody is ordinary because everybody is suffused with god. How can he be ordinary? Everybody is an abode of god, a shrine, sacred. How can he be common? So nobody is common and nobody is ordinary. Everybody is a unique creation of god.\nAnd one should respect oneself, so drop any condemnation that you have for yourself. Drop any kind of idea – that you are not like this, that you are not like that, that you should be this way or that way. Simply be as you are, and feel grateful that this is the way god has chosen you to be. This is the way god has chosen himself to be in you. And he knows better. There is no need to improve. The very idea of improvement creates anxiety and finally neurosis. (She nods, is looking open, feeling him.)\nThe more you try to improve yourself, the more you have to fight with yourself. The more you fight, the more you are divided into two: the one who wants to improve and the one who is being improved upon. And remember, the one who wants to improve is just the mind, the superficialmost thing in your being. And the one you want to improve upon is your nature, the most substantial thing in your being.\nSo the non-substantial tries to improve upon the substantial, and it creates much misery and perversion. When energies are not flowing in a natural way they become perverted, they become poisoned. And sooner or later a man is not a unity; he is split. He becomes two, or many; he becomes a crowd. Then all peace is lost and all silence gone, and there is no possibility of being joyful.\nUnity is a must. That is the meaning of the indian word ‘yoga’; it means unity. And the whole effort in the east has been how to help human beings to remain one. And if you can drop the idea of improving upon yourself, you are one! Nobody needs to be split, nobody needs to be schizophrenic.\nBut remember, when I say that you are unique I don’t mean in comparison with anybody else. You are simply unique as yourself – not more unique than somebody else. Just unique, non-comparative, non-evaluative, non-judgemental. You can be unique and all others can also be unique; there is no conflict.\nThe whole world is mad, competing. People are trying to prove themselves – to prove that they are better than you. There is no need because nobody is better and nobody is superior and nobody is inferior to anybody else. Everybody is just himself. And there are no two persons similar, so how can you compare? All comparison is stupid.\nThat is the meaning of the word wirla.\n[The new sannyasin says: I am really angry about the culture which is made around you. I don’t feel that you are making this culture. I feel that the people around you are making this culture.\nShe continues to argue with Osho about the way he lives in a ‘cage’; the no dust, no smell arrangement, etc. to which Osho says the following:]\nI understand, but always remember... if you are here, this has to be understood – that whatsoever is happening here, I am behind it. Nobody else is doing it.…\nI am behind it... about everything!.… Jesus is Jesus, and I am myself!...\nThat is your problem! That’s your problem. You need not worry. If you don’t want to come here, don’t.…\nThis is the way I have chosen to be.… This is not your problem at all.…\nThere is no need to understand it.… You need not understand it at all.…\nYou just be here... If you don’t want to be here, you don’t need to be. You need not.\n[If you want to be here] Then be here! Then you have to accept whatsoever is going on.… Don’t waste my time!\nYou will have to be here this way, otherwise I’m not interested. You decide. that is your problem; you decide it.…\nIf you have to be with me then you will have to follow everything that is here.…\nIf you don’t want to, then you are free. But never again bring this question. For everything that is happening here nobody is responsible except me. And this is the way I have chosen to be. I know why and I’m not responsible to anybody to have to answer for it. This is my way, my device for working. This is my way of choosing people. This is my way of dropping people who will not be of any worth.\nBecause this is just a beginning of surrender. If small things can disturb you then when I cut your head it will be very difficult. So if you want to be here with me, know it perfectly well and absolutely and once and for all, that whatsoever is happening here, about each and everything I am aware and I am behind it.\nSo never throw the responsibility on others, because that is a beautiful trick of the mind. You can think, ‘Osho is not behind it. These people – this Maneesha, this Haridas – these people are doing things.’ You can be angry at them and you can save me. That is not right. They are doing whatsoever I want.…\nNobody is doing anything of which I’m not aware. And nothing is happening which is happening against me. This you have to understand.…\nAnd I am not here to explain it to you.…\nIf you love me you will understand it. Just wait. I will not make you understand it – your very love will make you understand it. If you don’t love me then my explanations will not be of any help, mm?...\n[A sannyasin says: I’m a clinical psychologist. Osho gives him an energy blessing.]\nThings are really in a right space, and much will happen. You have done a lot of work in your past lives, so with just a little bit of work you can hope for much. With a little effort much can be the benefit.\nPeople who have never worked in their past lives have great difficulties. They have to start from the very beginning. It takes time, it takes a long time and much patience. Very few people are capable of waiting that long, because a few things have disappeared from this century: one of those things is patience.\nSpirituality is very low because the patience is not there to work that long and to work without any results. Because for long periods no results will be coming, and people leave. Many people start but very few people complete the journey.\nIn Tibet they have an old saying: ‘Many are called, only few listen. And of those few who listen, even fewer of them understand. Of those few who understand, only a few of them walk the path. Of those few who walk on the path, only a few of them reach.’\nSo it comes out at almost one in one thousand. But with you things will be different: you need not wait long. Much is already there. It just needs a final touch and things will start taking shape. Your third eye is very, very developed. Your intuitive part is just ready to function any moment.\nI can see only one thing as a barrier – and that is your training, because the whole training of a psychiatrist is of the intellect. It will be good if you start moving a little towards jungian psychology and things like that which are not confined to the intellect only, which accept the intuitive too, which are open, which look certainly less scientific, more poetic. They will be of immense help. Science is not all.\nPoetry has something immensely valuable to contribute, and without poetry the world will be a hopeless world. Intellect is good as far as it goes, but it doesn’t go far enough. There are a few things which are left to intuition: all that is great is left to intuition. It never comes by intellectual process; it simply comes like a flash, a lightning.\nSo lean more towards poetry. Continue your work but start moving towards things which are not so logical. A little bit of painting will be helpful, a little bit of poetry will be helpful, a little bit of music and dancing will be helpful. That will make you lean more towards the right hemisphere of your brain. You are carrying a treasure there. Only when you shift your consciousness to that part, can that treasure be used.\nOur whole training is for the left hemisphere: logic, language, mathematics – those traditional three ’r’s. They are all in the left hemisphere. They have created a great world, a great civilisation, technology. Man has been immensely benefited by it, but now he is stuck. It has done its part; now the other part needs to be opened. In fact, before it, it was not possible to tackle the other part. The other part needs more leisure, luxury. Only a few societies and a few people can afford it.\nParticularly in the past, human beings have lived in such poverty – almost in a state of constant starvation – that it was not possible to afford the right hemisphere. If you are hungry you cannot be poetic; if you are ill you cannot love music. If you are constantly struggling just to survive, then dance cannot have any meaning for you and painting is just irrelevant.\nFor the first time humanity has come, by the efforts of the left hemisphere, to a point where we can afford poetry, meditation prayer. Only a man who has come to that point can become a sannyasin. Before that, a sannyasin will be a beggar, just a beautiful name for begging, that’s all.\nBut when you are completely satisfied, with a developed left hemisphere – with logic, reasoning and all that reasoning can give – you suddenly feel something is missing, that something of real value is missing and that there is no way to get it from logic. Then the shift starts happening.\nIt is not accidental that more western people are coming to me than eastern. It is not just accidental. It is not just accidental that very educated people are becoming interested in me. They have seen what this half side of mind can do, and they are feeling suffocated with it. That very suffocation gives hope. So you have done as much as is possible for the left hemisphere. Now start shifting to the right hemisphere. Become more feminine, become more irrational. You can afford a little bit of madness, and that will be your enrichment.\nSo do a few groups, sing, dance, meditate. And for these eight weeks completely forget yourself... be lost. Don’t try to concentrate. Concentration is of the left hemisphere; meditation is of the right hemisphere. Meditation is relaxation. It is not focusing yourself on anything; it is completely unfocusing yourself. It is a state of no-concentration, a state of absorption; one is absorbed. One is alert but not attentive.\nAlertness is passive; there is no strain in it. One is alert because one is, that’s all. In attention there is effort; you are trying to do something. Be relaxed, be passive, be alert, and enjoy. Give yourself all permission to enjoy.\n... Be permissive. Don’t control. Live in a kind of chaos – yes, that’s the right word. And remember, only out of chaos are stars born, and only out of chaos.…\n[The sannyasin says: As long as I can remember, every six months or so I’ve had this feeling in my throat. And in Kundalini I feel it invariably in my hands. Now I feel it everywhere.]\nVery good! It simply needs good chanting: start chanting, mm? We have a chanting group; join it and start chanting. The energy was coming up; I could see it. It is there; a sound wants to explode. A sound wants to become a song. It will release you.\nOn your own also, just sit in a corner and chant. Anything will do! Chanting has not to be meaningful... it is just the joy of sound. Any gibberish sound will do. But be shaken by it, be\npossessed by it. Sway with it and sing it and move spontaneously. If it goes on changing, go on changing with it. There is no need to plan it, to make a formula or a mantra no need. Go with it, just like a small child. Sometimes small children do that: just any ‘ah-ha ha ha’. And it changes: it becomes whatsoever it becomes – simply go with it. That will be a good exercise for shifting your awareness from the left hemisphere to the right.\nYes, it is there. It will come up, and once it has exploded you will feel very very unburdened, light, young, like a child. I am happy... that you have come!\n[A sannyasin, who has only one leg is present. Osho suggests that he does zazen. It will suit you perfectly, he says chuckling, because one has just to sit!]\nBe happy while you are here! Mix with my people, become a part and participate in all kinds of things. Even if you cannot do them, just sit there.\nJust be with meditators, sit there. They will all be dancing, and you will be getting the benefit! [The sannyasin asks: Is it good if I do the meditation camp?]\nYes, this camp is coming. You have to do it, but no need to trouble your body. Do only that which you can do. If you cannot do something, then just be there. Sit there in the middle of the sannyasins – let them do. You just watch! Sometimes it happens that you may be benefited more than them.\nGod’s ways are strange!\n[A sannyasin says: Last night I woke up and I had a really high fever all of a sudden. It lasted one hour, and there was a lot of crying. I felt as if it were not me; it just happened.\nThen I went to see (a sannyasin living near her) and he said that at the same time he went through a rebirthing experience. I don’t know what it means but I feel very confused inside.\nOsho checks her energy.]\nMm mm. Good. Nothing to be worried about.\nSometimes it can happen. When you are opening or when you are growing fast, sudden fever can happen. The body is simply releasing some heat that was there always but which the body could not release. Now in the new state of the mind it can release it.\nPeople are really always in a fever – I mean psychologically. They go on repressing so much that a constant fever is there inside. When your mind starts changing you can release that fever; that affects the body. It is really psychological heat but it Is released m such a big amount that even the body feels it. But it will come suddenly and it will go suddenly. It is a good Indication. You will become more and more cool this way. And when it has happened three, four times, you will be surprised to see that you have never been cool before.\nA great coolness is going to happen. Before it happens at least three, four times you will have sudden fevers. But they will not last more than one hour, two hours, or three hours at the most.\nSo don’t get worried and don’t take any medicine. If the fever goes beyond three hours then make enquiries; otherwise no need to worry. If it is only for three hours or below that, no problem. It is good. The body is simply showing that the mind is releasing something and the body is affected by its release. After each such fever you will feel very very cool, collected, a kind of well-being. And you look perfectly good. If it happens two, three times more, then remind me again, mm?...\nIt is preparing you... it is preparing you. Rebirth simply means that a new being is going to be born. And all these things will help for the rebirth. You will have to become more cool, more spacious, more silent. It is a kind of rebirth, but when it has happened I will tell you.\nYou are going through the process; it takes time. It is not like ordinary birth – that within minutes the child is out of the womb. It takes years sometimes, months sometimes, and sometimes the whole life for the rebirth to be complete.\nIt is rebirthing. Rebirthing simply means that the old is going and the new is coming in.…\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"3186","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/only_losers_can_win_in_this_game/part6/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/only_losers_can_win_in_this_game/>Only Losers Can Win in This Game</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">6 Divine Dictator</h1><div class=post-meta>15 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;3186 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Only_Losers_Can_Win_in_This_Game/part6.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part5>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

superficialmost thing in your being. And the one you want to improve
upon is your nature, the most substantial thing in your being.</p><p><br></p><p>So the non-substantial tries to improve upon the substantial, and it
creates much misery and perversion. When energies are not flowing in a
natural way they become perverted, they become poisoned. And sooner or
later a man is not a unity; he is split. He becomes two, or many; he
becomes a crowd. Then all peace is lost and all silence gone, and there
is no possibility of being joyful.</p><p><br></p><p>Unity is a must. That is the meaning of the indian word ‘yoga’; it
means unity. And the whole effort in the east has been how to help human
beings to remain one. And if you can drop the idea of improving upon
yourself, you are one! Nobody needs to be split, nobody needs to be
schizophrenic.</p><p><br></p><p>But remember, when I say that you are unique I don’t mean in
comparison with anybody else. You are simply unique as yourself – not
more unique than somebody else. Just unique, non-comparative,
non-evaluative, non-judgemental. You can be unique and all others can
also be unique; there is no conflict.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole world is mad, competing. People are trying to prove
themselves – to prove that they are better than you. There is no need
because nobody is better and nobody is superior and nobody is inferior
to anybody else. Everybody is just himself. And there are no two persons
similar, so how can you compare? All comparison is stupid.</p><p><br></p><p>That is the meaning of the word wirla.</p><p><br></p><p>[The new sannyasin says: I am really angry about the culture which is
made around you. I don’t feel that you are making this culture. I feel
that the people around you are making this culture.</p><p><br></p><p>She continues to argue with Osho about the way he lives in a ‘cage’;
the no dust, no smell arrangement, etc. to which Osho says the
following:]</p><p><br></p><p>I understand, but always remember... if you are here, this has to be
understood – that whatsoever is happening here, I am behind it. Nobody
else is doing it.…</p><p><br></p><p>I am behind it... about everything!.… Jesus is Jesus, and I am
myself!...</p><p>That is your problem! That’s your problem. You need not worry. If you
don’t want to come here, don’t.…</p><p><br></p><p>This is the way I have chosen to be.… This is not your problem at
all.…</p><p>There is no need to understand it.… You need not understand it at
all.…</p><p>You just be here... If you don’t want to be here, you don’t need to
be. You need not.</p><p><br></p><p>[If you want to be here] Then be here! Then you have to accept
whatsoever is going on.… Don’t waste my time!</p><p>You will have to be here this way, otherwise I’m not interested. You
decide. that is your problem; you decide it.…</p><p><br></p><p>If you have to be with me then you will have to follow everything
that is here.…</p><p><br></p><p>If you don’t want to, then you are free. But never again bring this
question. For everything that is happening here nobody is responsible
except me. And this is the way I have chosen to be. I know why and I’m
not responsible to anybody to have to answer for it. This is my way, my
device for working. This is my way of choosing people. This is my way of
dropping people who will not be of any worth.</p><p><br></p><p>Because this is just a beginning of surrender. If small things can
disturb you then when I cut your head it will be very difficult. So if
you want to be here with me, know it perfectly well and absolutely and
once and for all, that whatsoever is happening here, about each and
everything I am aware and I am behind it.</p><p><br></p><p>So never throw the responsibility on others, because that is a
beautiful trick of the mind. You can think, ‘Osho is not behind it.
These people – this Maneesha, this Haridas – these people are doing
things.’ You can be angry at them and you can save me. That is not
right. They are doing whatsoever I want.…</p><p><br></p><p>Nobody is doing anything of which I’m not aware. And nothing is
happening which is happening against me. This you have to
understand.…</p><p><br></p><p>And I am not here to explain it to you.…</p><p><br></p><p>If you love me you will understand it. Just wait. I will not make you
understand it – your very love will make you understand it. If you don’t
love me then my explanations will not be of any help, mm?...</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin says: I’m a clinical psychologist. Osho gives him an
energy blessing.]</p><p>Things are really in a right space, and much will happen. You have
done a lot of work in your past lives, so with just a little bit of work
you can hope for much. With a little effort much can be the benefit.</p><p><br></p><p>People who have never worked in their past lives have great
difficulties. They have to start from the very beginning. It takes time,
it takes a long time and much patience. Very few people are capable of
waiting that long, because a few things have disappeared from this
century: one of those things is patience.</p><p><br></p><p>Spirituality is very low because the patience is not there to work
that long and to work without any results. Because for long periods no
results will be coming, and people leave. Many people start but very few
people complete the journey.</p><p><br></p><p>In Tibet they have an old saying: ‘Many are called, only few listen.
And of those few who listen, even fewer of them understand. Of those few
who understand, only a few of them walk the path. Of those few who walk
on the path, only a few of them reach.’</p><p><br></p><p>So it comes out at almost one in one thousand. But with you things
will be different: you need not wait long. Much is already there. It
just needs a final touch and things will start taking shape. Your third
eye is very, very developed. Your intuitive part is just ready to
function any moment.</p><p><br></p><p>I can see only one thing as a barrier – and that is your training,
because the whole training of a psychiatrist is of the intellect. It
will be good if you start moving a little towards jungian psychology and
things like that which are not confined to the intellect only, which
accept the intuitive too, which are open, which look certainly less
scientific, more poetic. They will be of immense help. Science is not
all.</p><p><br></p><p>Poetry has something immensely valuable to contribute, and without
poetry the world will be a hopeless world. Intellect is good as far as
it goes, but it doesn’t go far enough. There are a few things which are
left to intuition: all that is great is left to intuition. It never
comes by intellectual process; it simply comes like a flash, a
lightning.</p><p><br></p><p>So lean more towards poetry. Continue your work but start moving
towards things which are not so logical. A little bit of painting will
be helpful, a little bit of poetry will be helpful, a little bit of
music and dancing will be helpful. That will make you lean more towards
the right hemisphere of your brain. You are carrying a treasure there.
Only when you shift your consciousness to that part, can that treasure
be used.</p><p><br></p><p>Our whole training is for the left hemisphere: logic, language,
mathematics – those traditional three ’r’s. They are all in the left
hemisphere. They have created a great world, a great civilisation,
technology. Man has been immensely benefited by it, but now he is stuck.
It has done its part; now the other part needs to be opened. In fact,
before it, it was not possible to tackle the other part. The other part
needs more leisure, luxury. Only a few societies and a few people can
afford it.</p><p><br></p><p>Particularly in the past, human beings have lived in such poverty –
almost in a state of constant starvation – that it was not possible to
afford the right hemisphere. If you are hungry you cannot be poetic; if
you are ill you cannot love music. If you are constantly struggling just
to survive, then dance cannot have any meaning for you and painting is
just irrelevant.</p><p><br></p><p>For the first time humanity has come, by the efforts of the left
hemisphere, to a point where we can afford poetry, meditation prayer.
Only a man who has come to that point can become a sannyasin. Before
that, a sannyasin will be a beggar, just a beautiful name for begging,
that’s all.</p><p><br></p><p>But when you are completely satisfied, with a developed left
hemisphere – with logic, reasoning and all that reasoning can give – you
suddenly feel something is missing, that something of real value is
missing and that there is no way to get it from logic. Then the shift
starts happening.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not accidental that more western people are coming to me than
eastern. It is not just accidental. It is not just accidental that very
educated people are becoming interested in me. They have seen what this
half side of mind can do, and they are feeling suffocated with it. That
very suffocation gives hope. So you have done as much as is possible for
the left hemisphere. Now start shifting to the right hemisphere. Become
more feminine, become more irrational. You can afford a little bit of
madness, and that will be your enrichment.</p><p><br></p><p>So do a few groups, sing, dance, meditate. And for these eight weeks
completely forget yourself... be lost. Don’t try to concentrate.
Concentration is of the left hemisphere; meditation is of the right
hemisphere. Meditation is relaxation. It is not focusing yourself on
anything; it is completely unfocusing yourself. It is a state of
no-concentration, a state of absorption; one is absorbed. One is alert
but not attentive.</p><p><br></p><p>Alertness is passive; there is no strain in it. One is alert because
one is, that’s all. In attention there is effort; you are trying to do
something. Be relaxed, be passive, be alert, and enjoy. Give yourself
all permission to enjoy.</p><p><br></p><p>... Be permissive. Don’t control. Live in a kind of chaos – yes,
that’s the right word. And remember, only out of chaos are stars born,
and only out of chaos.…</p><p><br></p><p>[The sannyasin says: As long as I can remember, every six months or
so I’ve had this feeling in my throat. And in Kundalini I feel it
invariably in my hands. Now I feel it everywhere.]</p><p><br></p><p>Very good! It simply needs good chanting: start chanting, mm? We have
a chanting group; join it and start chanting. The energy was coming up;
I could see it. It is there; a sound wants to explode. A sound wants to
become a song. It will release you.</p><p><br></p><p>On your own also, just sit in a corner and chant. Anything will do!
Chanting has not to be meaningful... it is just the joy of sound. Any
gibberish sound will do. But be shaken by it, be</p><p><br></p><p>possessed by it. Sway with it and sing it and move spontaneously. If
it goes on changing, go on changing with it. There is no need to plan
it, to make a formula or a mantra no need. Go with it, just like a small
child. Sometimes small children do that: just any ‘ah-ha ha ha’. And it
changes: it becomes whatsoever it becomes – simply go with it. That will
be a good exercise for shifting your awareness from the left hemisphere
to the right.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, it is there. It will come up, and once it has exploded you will
feel very very unburdened, light, young, like a child. I am happy...
that you have come!</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin, who has only one leg is present. Osho suggests that he
does zazen. It will suit you perfectly, he says chuckling, because one
has just to sit!]</p><p><br></p><p>Be happy while you are here! Mix with my people, become a part and
participate in all kinds of things. Even if you cannot do them, just sit
there.</p><p><br></p><p>Just be with meditators, sit there. They will all be dancing, and you
will be getting the benefit! [The sannyasin asks: Is it good if I do the
meditation camp?]</p><p>Yes, this camp is coming. You have to do it, but no need to trouble
your body. Do only that which you can do. If you cannot do something,
then just be there. Sit there in the middle of the sannyasins – let them
do. You just watch! Sometimes it happens that you may be benefited more
than them.</p><p><br></p><p>God’s ways are strange!</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin says: Last night I woke up and I had a really high fever
all of a sudden. It lasted one hour, and there was a lot of crying. I
felt as if it were not me; it just happened.</p><p><br></p><p>Then I went to see (a sannyasin living near her) and he said that at
the same time he went through a rebirthing experience. I don’t know what
it means but I feel very confused inside.</p><p><br></p><p>Osho checks her energy.]</p><p><br></p><p>Mm mm. Good. Nothing to be worried about.</p><p><br></p><p>Sometimes it can happen. When you are opening or when you are growing
fast, sudden fever can happen. The body is simply releasing some heat
that was there always but which the body could not release. Now in the
new state of the mind it can release it.</p><p><br></p><p>People are really always in a fever – I mean psychologically. They go
on repressing so much that a constant fever is there inside. When your
mind starts changing you can release that fever; that affects the body.
It is really psychological heat but it Is released m such a big amount
that even the body feels it. But it will come suddenly and it will go
suddenly. It is a good Indication. You will become more and more cool
this way. And when it has happened three, four times, you will be
surprised to see that you have never been cool before.</p><p><br></p><p>A great coolness is going to happen. Before it happens at least
three, four times you will have sudden fevers. But they will not last
more than one hour, two hours, or three hours at the most.</p><p><br></p><p>So don’t get worried and don’t take any medicine. If the fever goes
beyond three hours then make enquiries; otherwise no need to worry. If
it is only for three hours or below that, no problem. It is good. The
body is simply showing that the mind is releasing something and the body
is affected by its release. After each such fever you will feel very
very cool, collected, a kind of well-being. And you look perfectly good.
If it happens two, three times more, then remind me again, mm?...</p><p><br></p><p>It is preparing you... it is preparing you. Rebirth simply means that
a new being is going to be born. And all these things will help for the
rebirth. You will have to become more cool, more spacious, more silent.
It is a kind of rebirth, but when it has happened I will tell you.</p><p><br></p><p>You are going through the process; it takes time. It is not like
ordinary birth – that within minutes the child is out of the womb. It
takes years sometimes, months sometimes, and sometimes the whole life
for the rebirth to be complete.</p><p><br></p><p>It is rebirthing. Rebirthing simply means that the old is going and
the new is coming in.…</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part5>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

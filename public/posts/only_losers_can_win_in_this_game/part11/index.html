And that is the actual case: love is raining all over, because love is the stuff the universe is made of. When you pass by the side of a tree, the tree showers love. When you are standing open, under the open sky, the whole cosmos showers it. It comes in the form of sunrays; it comes in a thousand and one forms. You have to learn to see it as love; that is going to be your discipline.\nGo deep into everything and find love, and if you look you will find it. We only find that for which we look. Great mysteries can be by-passed if we are not looking for them because our mind only concentrates on a few things. The scientists say that we come to know only two percent of things in life. Ninety-eight percent remains unknown because we are not interested in it.\nExistence is full of mystery. Every nook and corner is full of god... every particle of dust is divine. But we are not in relationship with it. We are not searching for it, we are not enquiring into it. Become an explorer and try to find love everywhere.… The rose is opening.Look, search for love, and you\nwill find it. That’s what Jesus means when he says, ‘Knock and the door shall be opened. Ask and it shall be given. Seek and you will find.’\nLet love be your search... let that be your target. And even sometimes when you see something very unloving, it is just love energy in a perverted form. Somebody is full of hate; it is love energy fallen into a perverted shape, that’s all. It is pure gold; it is just that somebody has made a monster out of it. It can be converted into beautiful ornaments.\nSo let this be your continuous search. Somebody looks at you: search in his eyes. Somebody holds your hand: search in that warmth. Somebody is angry at you: search for love and you will find it.\nBecause people are angry only when they love, otherwise they are not angry. You are more angry with the person you love. If the same thing had been done by somebody else you would not bother, you would not care less. But if somebody that you care for and you love is doing something wrong – something that looks wrong to you at least – you become angry. It is love energy.\nOnce you know this secret – that love energy is everywhere – you will start opening. It is showering. Don’t defend yourself!\nAnand means bliss, blissfulness, manda means gentle: gentle blissfulness. The transformation that is going to happen to you will not be like violent laughter: it will be like a gentle smile. It will be very graceful. It will be round; it will not have any angles to it. It will be feminine. A smile is feminine, laughter is masculine. And laughter has something hysterical about it; a smile is very healthy.\nSo become a gentle blissfulness!\nSatya means truth, puratana means ancient. You have been a seeker for a very very long time. And all that you have done in the past lives can be used; nothing will go as a wastage. You are not yet aware of it but it will start surfacing. You have done something substantial and good, and it is there. Everything will fall into unity soon.\nEverybody is ancient but everybody has not been on the path. Sometimes a person comes who has never been on any path, who has never thought of meditation, of prayer, of god; it has never been relevant to his life. Then he has to start from abc. But you have much in your store of consciousness; all that can be used. And a great edifice is possible very soon.\nSo keep it in mind that you have been trekking on spiritual paths for a long time. Soon dreams of your past lives will start coming to you. Sometimes visions will start coming; don’t be afraid and don’t get scared.\n[The new sannyasin asks: I have a need and there is a motivation but I cannot define it.]\nThat’s clear to me, mm? You cannot define it because it is coming from your unconscious and the conscious is not aware of it. You feel it in a very very vague sense. It is nebulous but soon it will become defined. That is going to happen: soon it will become very very clear.\nJust get involved in things here. Even for the four, five weeks you are here, absolutely become a part. Do the groups, meditate, meet sannyasins, sit with them. Become part of this space here. It will become defined; nothing to be worried about, mm? It is on the way... coming!\nPrem means love, mayura means peacock: a love peacock. And the peacock is one of the most dancing energies.…\nThe peacock is the national bird here in India and in the new place where we are going there are hundreds of peacocks.\nIt is the most colourful bird, the most psychedelic. It has all the colours of the rainbow... and the colours are not ordinary colours – very luminous.\nWhen the peacock dances, it is something rare. It dances only at a particular moment. After the summer has passed, the whole earth is thirsty and the first clouds start coming in the sky, then it dances. It is a welcome from the earth to the clouds.\nAnd dance is your element, hence I am giving you the name. Go into dance more and more deeply. It is there you will find yourself. Everybody has to find himself in his own way, and dance is one of the most beautiful meditations possible. If one can dance then there is nothing like it. There is no need to learn formal dancing; let it be spontaneous.\nWhen you are alone and there is nothing to do, dance! And let it come from above, from the beyond. Become a puppet in the hands of god. Whatsoever comes naturally, allow it, and soon you will get the knack of it. That is going to become; the key for your inner work.\nFind a picture of a dancing peacock, mm? – and get in tune with a dancing peacock!\n[The new sannyasin asks: I started studying acupuncture and I just wondered if I’m going in the right direction.\nOsho checks her energy.]\nVery good! It will go perfectly well with you. You can surrender easily, and that’s the secret. Acupuncture is not a science but an art, and every art demands of you a deep surrender. It is not just technique; it is not like any other technique that a technician can manipulate. It needs your whole heart in it. You have to forget yourself – just as a painter forgets while painting or a poet forgets while composing, a musician forgets while playing. It is that kind of thing.\nA technician can practise acupuncture but he will never be exactly what is needed; he will never be that. He may help a few people, but it is a great art, a great skill. It has to be imbibed and you can imbibe it. Mm? the secret is surrender. If you can surrender yourself totally to it, if it becomes a devotion, a dedication... and it can become.\nGo into it... go wholeheartedly, with joy, mm? Good! [Osho gives a name for a centre: araj.]\nIt means chaos, it means anarchy, it means disorderIt means all the good things possible!\n[An exuberant sannyasin who is a topless go-go dancer/waitress tells Osho all the activities she has done, concluding: mainly dancing.]\nDancing is immensely valuable. Dancing should become a natural phenomenon for everybody. It was once; it is still in very primitive people. It is not that a few people dance – there are no dancers; everybody is a dancer. Dancing is a general activity, like breathing. There are still tribes, small tribes in india in deep forests; their whole life is dance. They cannot believe that there are people who don’t dance, because they cannot believe how you can live without dancing! Lire will be almost nil.\nTheir whole life revolves around dance. Each and everything becomes an excuse for dance. Each night is a dancing night and the whole tribe dances: small children, women, men, old women.no\nbarriers of age. Dance is for all because dance is equivalent to life. Man has missed much.\nBertrand Russell has said somewhere that he was always in favour of civilisation, culture; he was a rational man. But when he came across a primitive tribe in africa his whole idea of civilisation simply fell down flat on the ground, and he started feeling very jealous. He writes, ‘In that moment I was ready to drop all culture and all civilisation if I could know how to dance again.’\nMy sannyasins have all to be dancers, and no excuse should be missed; each excuse has to be used as an opportunity to dance. Somebody’s birthday, dance; somebody has died, dance. Somebody is ill, dance around him. Somebody is going for a journey, give him a farewell dance. Somebody is coming, welcome him with dance. Make it a point that the more you dance, the more you are in tune with god.\nWhen you dance it is god who dances in you; that’s why it is so beautiful. Whenever you dance you are no more separate, you don’t have a split. You are no more body/mind; you are no more this and that. You don’t have alternatives. All alternatives disappear, all dualities disappear. In fact there is no dancer and the dance; there is only dance!\nOne comes to a state of non-duality, and non-duality is orgasm. That’s what people are searching for through love, through alcohol, through drugs – a state where they are no more separate from existence. But those methods are dangerous and very costly. You gain very little joy and you destroy your whole chemistry, your body. It is not worth it.\nThrough dance you don’t lose anything and you gain infinitySo dance here, mm? Very good!\n[A newly arrived sannyasin says: I want to explode but I can’t!.It’s much bigger than I am and I\ndon’t know how to get it out.] Yes, that I can see, mm?...\nRather than you getting it out, it will come into you; that is far easier. These are the two processes: either you get out and expand or let god in, then you need not get out. the sky itself comes into you, and that is far easier, needs less effort. These are the two paths: the path of will and the path of surrender. The path of will means that you have to get out, you have to do something, and naturally it is arduous, it is very difficult. It is like pulling yourself up by your shoestrings. It is also very frustrating because it almost always fails; it very rarely succeeds. From the path of will very few people reach to the ultimate.\nThe other is far easier: you invite god into your small cottage, into your small hut. You surrender. You don’t make any effort to go anywhere. You simply open your doors and the sun and the breeze comes in. In that very coming you disappear...\nIt will be possible; there is no problem, mm? You need not explode: just allow god to penetrate you.\n[A sannyasin, who has been doing groups, says that she goes to extremes with her energy, very yang or very yin. Osho checks her energy, saying: Just do one thing: raise your fists, both fists. Clench them, and close your eyes and say ‘no’ and get into the feel of it.]\nYou can go to extremes easilyBut my feeling is that you need not be worried about any yang\nqualities in you. They are there and they have to be used rather than denied. If you deny them\nyou will never be total. They are there and when they are they have to be absorbed, they have to be used. They can be used creatively. The male energy is aggressive, true, but all creation is aggression.\nWhen you sculpt an image it is aggression on the stone, on the rock; you start cutting the rock. Whenever you create something first you have to destroy, but it should not be for the sake of destruction; that’s all that has to be remembered. The end should always be creation; destruction can be used as a means. And you have that energy in you. If you become afraid of it then you will be afraid of yourself. If you don’t use it, if you keep it away from yourself, then you will feel like collapsing. Because it is your energy, so when you are expressive you feel good and when that disappears and you become more feminine, you feel hollow, empty, collapsing, caving in.\nYour prominent energy is male. Nothing is wrong about it: there are men whose prominent energy is female; there are women whose prominent energy is male. The body does not always decide; the body is not decisive.\nSo use your energy in a creative way, and don’t feel shy about it; don’t shrink away from it. Your joy will happen through it. Get in tune with your power, energy, aggression; go into it – it is great energy if used rightly. And become a little creative: find something that you would like to do and do it.\nHave you any kind of hobbies ?\n[She replies she has been doing body work, which feels like a vocation.] Mm mm... it is perfectly good. Go into it deeply, mm ? That’s very good!\n[A sannyasin says that when she starts feeling her energy flowing it takes the form of a sensation of being pulled out of the top of her head. Osho checks her energy.]\nIt is going perfectly well. Allow it... don’t defend yourself; go with it. It is a very very friendly energy. Don’t be resistant. If you are not alone then go somewhere where you can be alone and allow it, but it has to be allowed. It will disappear within two, three weeks, but its work is there. It has to do certain work there: it is changing the very chemistry of the brain.\nIt can become very intense; don’t be afraid. It can become almost painful, don’t be afraid. It is doing some surgery there: some old, dead blocks are melting. Once they have melted it will disappear. But good! Nothing to be worried about!\n[Osho recommends that now she do Zazen and Vipassana, saying that something beautiful is going to happen, so she should keep track of it and not interfere.]\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2514","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/only_losers_can_win_in_this_game/part11/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/only_losers_can_win_in_this_game/>Only Losers Can Win in This Game</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">11 Mystical marionettes</h1><div class=post-meta>12 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2514 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Only_Losers_Can_Win_in_This_Game/part11.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part10>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

wondered if I’m going in the right direction.</p><p><br></p><p>Osho checks her energy.]</p><p><br></p><p>Very good! It will go perfectly well with you. You can surrender
easily, and that’s the secret. Acupuncture is not a science but an art,
and every art demands of you a deep surrender. It is not just technique;
it is not like any other technique that a technician can manipulate. It
needs your whole heart in it. You have to forget yourself – just as a
painter forgets while painting or a poet forgets while composing, a
musician forgets while playing. It is that kind of thing.</p><p><br></p><p>A technician can practise acupuncture but he will never be exactly
what is needed; he will never be that. He may help a few people, but it
is a great art, a great skill. It has to be imbibed and you can imbibe
it. Mm? the secret is surrender. If you can surrender yourself totally
to it, if it becomes a devotion, a dedication... and it can become.</p><p><br></p><p>Go into it... go wholeheartedly, with joy, mm? Good! [Osho gives a
name for a centre: araj.<span class=s4></span>]</p><p>It means chaos, it means anarchy, it means disorder<span class=s4></span>It means all the good things possible!</p><p><br></p><p>[An exuberant sannyasin who is a topless go-go dancer/waitress tells
Osho all the activities she has done, concluding: mainly dancing.]</p><p><br></p><p>Dancing is immensely valuable. Dancing should become a natural
phenomenon for everybody. It was once; it is still in very primitive
people. It is not that a few people dance – there are no dancers;
everybody is a dancer. Dancing is a general activity, like breathing.
There are still tribes, small tribes in india in deep forests; their
whole life is dance. They cannot believe that there are people who don’t
dance, because they cannot believe how you can live without dancing!
Lire will be almost nil.</p><p><br></p><p>Their whole life revolves around dance. Each and everything becomes
an excuse for dance. Each night is a dancing night and the whole tribe
dances: small children, women, men, old women.<span class=s4></span>no</p><p>barriers of age. Dance is for all because dance is equivalent to
life. Man has missed much.</p><p><br></p><p>Bertrand Russell has said somewhere that he was always in favour of
civilisation, culture; he was a rational man. But when he came across a
primitive tribe in africa his whole idea of civilisation simply fell
down flat on the ground, and he started feeling very jealous. He writes,
‘In that moment I was ready to drop all culture and all civilisation if
I could know how to dance again.’</p><p><br></p><p>My sannyasins have all to be dancers, and no excuse should be missed;
each excuse has to be used as an opportunity to dance. Somebody’s
birthday, dance; somebody has died, dance. Somebody is ill, dance around
him. Somebody is going for a journey, give him a farewell dance.
Somebody is coming, welcome him with dance. Make it a point that the
more you dance, the more you are in tune with god.</p><p><br></p><p>When you dance it is god who dances in you; that’s why it is so
beautiful. Whenever you dance you are no more separate, you don’t have a
split. You are no more body/mind; you are no more this and that. You
don’t have alternatives. All alternatives disappear, all dualities
disappear. In fact there is no dancer and the dance; there is only
dance!</p><p><br></p><p>One comes to a state of non-duality, and non-duality is orgasm.
That’s what people are searching for through love, through alcohol,
through drugs – a state where they are no more separate from existence.
But those methods are dangerous and very costly. You gain very little
joy and you destroy your whole chemistry, your body. It is not worth
it.</p><p><br></p><p>Through dance you don’t lose anything and you gain infinity<span class=s4></span>So dance here, mm? Very good!</p><p><br></p><p>[A newly arrived sannyasin says: I want to explode but I can’t!.<span class=s4></span>It’s much bigger than I am and I</p><p>don’t know how to get it out.] Yes, that I can see, mm?...</p><p>Rather than you getting it out, it will come into you; that is far
easier. These are the two processes: either you get out and expand or
let god in, then you need not get out. the sky itself comes into you,
and that is far easier, needs less effort. These are the two paths: the
path of will and the path of surrender. The path of will means that you
have to get out, you have to do something, and naturally it is arduous,
it is very difficult. It is like pulling yourself up by your
shoestrings. It is also very frustrating because it almost always fails;
it very rarely succeeds. From the path of will very few people reach to
the ultimate.</p><p><br></p><p>The other is far easier: you invite god into your small cottage, into
your small hut. You surrender. You don’t make any effort to go anywhere.
You simply open your doors and the sun and the breeze comes in. In that
very coming you disappear...</p><p><br></p><p>It will be possible; there is no problem, mm? You need not explode:
just allow god to penetrate you.</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin, who has been doing groups, says that she goes to
extremes with her energy, very yang or very yin. Osho checks her energy,
saying: Just do one thing: raise your fists, both fists. Clench them,
and close your eyes and say ‘no’ and get into the feel of it.]</p><p><br></p><p>You can go to extremes easily<span class=s4></span>But my feeling
is that you need not be worried about any yang</p><p>qualities in you. They are there and they have to be used rather than
denied. If you deny them</p><p><br></p><p>you will never be total. They are there and when they are they have
to be absorbed, they have to be used. They can be used creatively. The
male energy is aggressive, true, but all creation is aggression.</p><p><br></p><p>When you sculpt an image it is aggression on the stone, on the rock;
you start cutting the rock. Whenever you create something first you have
to destroy, but it should not be for the sake of destruction; that’s all
that has to be remembered. The end should always be creation;
destruction can be used as a means. And you have that energy in you. If
you become afraid of it then you will be afraid of yourself. If you
don’t use it, if you keep it away from yourself, then you will feel like
collapsing. Because it is your energy, so when you are expressive you
feel good and when that disappears and you become more feminine, you
feel hollow, empty, collapsing, caving in.</p><p><br></p><p>Your prominent energy is male. Nothing is wrong about it: there are
men whose prominent energy is female; there are women whose prominent
energy is male. The body does not always decide; the body is not
decisive.</p><p><br></p><p>So use your energy in a creative way, and don’t feel shy about it;
don’t shrink away from it. Your joy will happen through it. Get in tune
with your power, energy, aggression; go into it – it is great energy if
used rightly. And become a little creative: find something that you
would like to do and do it.</p><p><br></p><p>Have you any kind of hobbies ?</p><p><br></p><p>[She replies she has been doing body work, which feels like a
vocation.] Mm mm... it is perfectly good. Go into it deeply, mm ? That’s
very good!</p><p>[A sannyasin says that when she starts feeling her energy flowing it
takes the form of a sensation of being pulled out of the top of her
head. Osho checks her energy.]</p><p><br></p><p>It is going perfectly well. Allow it... don’t defend yourself; go
with it. It is a very very friendly energy. Don’t be resistant. If you
are not alone then go somewhere where you can be alone and allow it, but
it has to be allowed. It will disappear within two, three weeks, but its
work is there. It has to do certain work there: it is changing the very
chemistry of the brain.</p><p><br></p><p>It can become very intense; don’t be afraid. It can become almost
painful, don’t be afraid. It is doing some surgery there: some old, dead
blocks are melting. Once they have melted it will disappear. But good!
Nothing to be worried about!</p><p><br></p><p>[Osho recommends that now she do Zazen and Vipassana, saying that
something beautiful is going to happen, so she should keep track of it
and not interfere.]</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part10>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

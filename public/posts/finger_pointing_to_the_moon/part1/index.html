MAY ARYAMA, INDRA, BRAHASPATI AND\nVISHNU GIVE US THEIR BENEDICTION.\nMY SALUTATIONS TO BRAHMA, THE ABSOLUTE REALITY.\nO VAYU, THE GOD OF AIR, SALUTATIONS ESPECIALLY TO YOU, BECAUSE YOU ARE THE BRAHMA MANIFEST.\nI SHALL CALL ONLY YOU THE MANIFEST BRAHMA.\nI SHALL ALSO CALL YOU THE TRUTH, CALL YOU RIT – THE LAW. MAY THEY PROTECT ME. MAY THEY PROTECT THE SPEAKER.\n2\nPROTECT ME. PROTECT THE SPEAKER. OM, PEACE, PEACE, PEACE.\nI will say only that which I know. I will say only that which you can also know. By knowing I mean living it. One may know even without living it, but such knowledge is a burden; one may sink because of it, but one cannot be saved by it. Knowing can be alive also. Such knowing renders us weightless – light so that we can fly in the sky. Only when living becomes knowing do wings grow, fetters break and the doors to the infinite become wide open.\nBut knowing is difficult; accumulating knowledge is easy. Mind chooses the easier and avoids the difficult. But the one who avoids the difficult will miss religion as well. One who wants to avoid not only the difficult but the impossible too will never ever come close to religion.\nReligion is only for those who are ready to enter into the impossible. Religion is for the gamblers, not for the shopkeepers. Religion is neither a business deal nor a compromise. Religion is a wager. A gambler puts his wealth at stake; the religious person puts himself at stake because that is the ultimate wealth.\nOne who is not ready to stake his very life will never be able to know the hidden mysteries of life. Those secrets are not available cheaply. Knowledge is available very cheaply; knowledge is available from books, from scriptures, in education, with the teachers. Knowledge is available almost for free; you do not have to pay anything for it. In religion you have to pay heavily. It is not right even to say “heavily” because only when someone stakes everything do the doors to that life open. The doors to that life open only for those who put this life at stake. To put this life at stake is the only key to the door of that life. But knowledge is very cheap, so the mind chooses the easier and the cheaper way. We learn things – words, doctrines – and think that we know. Such knowledge only enhances ignorance.\nThe ignorant person at least knows that he does not know; at least that much truth he has. But more untruthful people cannot be found than those whom we call knowledgeable. They do not even know that they do not know. Something heard, something committed to memory, deludes them into thinking they have also known.\nI will say to you only that which I know, because only in saying that lies some value; because only that which I know can, if you are willing, vibrate the strings of your heart too with its living impact.\nWhat I myself do not know, and what is only skin deep in me, cannot go much deeper in you either. Only that which has entered the depths of my own heart has the possibility; if you cooperate, it can reach your heart. Even then your cooperation is a must, because if your heart is closed there is no way of thrusting the truth forcefully into it. And it is good that it is so, because if truth can be forcibly inculcated it cannot become your freedom, it can only become your slavery. All compulsions become slaveries.\nSo in this world, everything can be given to you through force; only truth cannot be, because truth can never become slavery. The very nature of truth is freedom. So truth is the only thing in this world which nobody can give you forcefully, which nobody can thrust upon you, which cannot be put\nupon you from the outside like clothing; for which your willingness, your openness, your receptivity, your invitation, your heart full of gratitude are the prerequisites. If your heart becomes like the earth before the rainy season when it is thirsty for water and develops wide cracks due to the parching summer heat – as if it has opened up its lips here and there anticipating the rains – then the truth enters you. Otherwise the truth turns back even from your very doorstep. Many times it has turned back – in many, many lifetimes.\nYou are not new – nothing is new on this earth; you are all very old. You have sat at the feet of Buddha and heard him, you have seen Krishna, you have also been around Jesus, but still you have missed, because your heart was never ready. The rivers of Buddha and Mahavira have flowed past you, but you have remained thirsty.\nThe day Buddha was about to leave his body, Ananda was weeping and beating his chest in desperation. Buddha asked him, “Why are you weeping? I have been near you for long enough... forty years! And if it has not happened even in forty years, what is the point of weeping now? And why are you feeling so troubled about my death?”\nAnanda replied, “I am so distressed because I could not manage to disappear while you were here. Had I disappeared, you would have been able to enter me. For forty years the river was flowing by my side and I have remained thirsty. Now I am weeping because I do not know when and in what lifetime I shall be able to meet this river again.”\nYou are not new. You have cremated Buddhas, you have cremated Mahaviras – Jesus, Krishna and all; you are living after cremating them all. They lost the battle against you. You are very old. You have been here since life is. It has been an infinite journey. Where are we missing? It is just that you are not open, you are closed.\nI will say to you only that which I have known. If you can make yourself an opening, you will also know that. And it is not that there is some great difficulty in it. There is only one difficulty, and that is you.\nSome people move only with curiosity, just like small children asking while they are on a walk, “What is the name of this tree?” And if you don’t reply, they immediately forget that they had asked anything and they start asking something else: “Why is this rock lying here?” They ask just for the sake of asking and not in order to know. They do not ask in order to know, they ask because they cannot remain without asking.\nThose who are living out of curiosity are still childish. If you ask, “What is God?” just as casually as a child would ask on seeing a toy shop on the road, “What is this toy?” you are still a child. And the child can be forgiven, but not you.\nCuriosity will not do. Religion is not a child’s play. Even if you are given a reply, it serves no purpose. The child’s fun is in asking. He could ask, that is his fun. Even if you give him a reply he is not very interested in it. What is the matter?\nPsychologists say that when children learn to speak for the first time they are only practicing their speaking by asking; just as when a child learns walking for the first time, he tries every now and then\nto get up and walk. So children repeat the same sentence again and again only because they have acquired a new experience, a new dimension through speaking. So in that new dimension they are floating and rehearsing – that is why they ask just anything, they say just anything.\nIn the world of religion, if you are also asking just anything, saying just anything, thinking just anything without any deep desire to know – only out of curiosity – then you will still cremate some more buddhas; then who knows how many more buddhas will still have to work hard on you!\nTruth has no relationship to curiosity.\nSome people move a little ahead of curiosity and become inquisitive. There is a little more depth in inquisitiveness, but just a little more. Inquisitiveness is also not very deep, it is shallow as well, for it is only intellectual. The intellect is the same as scabies: if you scratch it a bit, it feels good. So the intellect goes on itching: Is there God? Is there any soul? Is there any salvation? What is meditation? – not that you want to do it. What is God? – not that you want to know it, but just for discussion, just for conversation.… It is a mental exercise, an intellectual entertainment. So people only talk big, they never stake anything. Whether God is or is not, it is not truly their concern; and they remain untransformed whether God does exist or does not.\nIt is very interesting: one person believes there is a God, another believes there is no God, and the lives of the two are identical. If someone is abused, the one who believes there is a God gets angry, and the one who believes there is no God, he also gets angry. Sometimes it happens that the one who believes there is a God gets even more angry. The one who believes there is no God, how much can he do to you? At best he may abuse you in return, hit you or kill you. But the one who believes there is a God can send you to rot in the agonies of hell. He has more ways of becoming angry.\nIf belief in God or no belief in God does not bring about any change in one’s life, it only means that it has no relation to God, it is only intellectual talk. Such inquisitiveness makes a man a philosopher. He goes on contemplating and deliberating, he learns the scriptures, accumulates too many doctrines, is able to think of all the pros and cons, holds debates, but he never lives.\nIf you are also only full of inquisitiveness there will be no journey at all. People full of inquisitiveness are those who sit near the milestone and ask, “What is the destination? How far is the destination?” They continue asking this but never get up and begin to walk.\nYou know so much! What is there that is lacking in your knowing? You know almost everything – whatever Buddha knew or Mahavira or Krishna knew you also know. While reading the Gita, don’t you feel you know all this?\nYes, you also know, but this is all only in your head. Their seed has not reached your heart. And the ideas that are only in the mind are like the seed lying on a stone. The seed is there, lying on the stone, but it cannot sprout. To sprout, the seed will have to fall down off the stone and seek the soil. And the surface of the soil is not suitable either, because more moisture is needed. So it has to move underneath the surface to where there is some water, where there is some juice flowing.\nSeeds remain in the mind like those lying on the stone. Until they fall down into the heart the wet soil is not available. In the heart some juice flows, some love; there is some water there. If a seed falls there, it sprouts.\nInquisitive people have a lot within them; everything is there, but it is like the seeds lying on the stone. The soil is not far off, but even this little journey is difficult for them. They are averse to moving, so the seed remains sitting on the rock. This small journey will have to be undertaken – that the seed falls down from the stone to the soil, seeks a place in the soil, finds some wetness, and hides itself a little inside the soil.\nRemember, whatsoever is to be born in this world needs a deep silence, solitude and darkness. Those things that are kept in the mind are kept in the open light. Sprouting is not possible there. The heart is the wet soil hidden within you. There something can sprout.\nTherefore those who live only in inquisitiveness become scholars and pundits; knowledgeable, but nothing sprouts within them – no new birth, no new life, no new flowers, nothing at all.\nThere is one more dimension of seeking, we call it mumuksha, a deep longing for liberation. Here there is no concern for knowing, the concern is for living. Here there is no concern for knowing, the concern is for being. The question is not whether there is a God or not, the question is whether I can be God. There may be a God, but if I cannot become God then there is no point in it all. The question is not whether there is any liberation, the question is whether I can also be liberated. If there is no possibility of my becoming liberated, then even if there is a liberation somewhere it is meaningless for me. The issue is not whether there is a soul within or not – there may be, there may not be – the real issue is whether I can become a soul.\nMumuksha, the longing for liberation, is a search to be. And when one wants to be, one has to put oneself at stake. This is why I say religion is a gambler’s affair.\nI will say only that which I know, which I have lived. If you agree to put all at stake, whatever is my experience can also become yours. Experiences do not belong to anyone; whosoever is ready to receive them, they come to him. Nobody has any right over the truth, whosoever is willing to disappear inherits it. Truth belongs to one who shows the readiness to ask for it – who opens the doors of his heart and calls for it.\nThis is why I have chosen this Upanishad. This Upanishad is a direct encounter with spirituality. There are no siddhants, doctrines, in it; there are only experiences of siddhas, the fulfilled ones, in it. In it there is no discussion of that which is born out of curiosity or inquisitiveness, no, in it there are hints to those who are full of longing for liberation by those who already have attained liberation.\nThere are some people who have not attained, yet they are unable to drop the enjoyment of guiding others. Giving guidance is a very enjoyable thing. In the whole world, the thing that is given the most is guidance, and the thing least accepted is also guidance. Everybody gives, nobody takes.\nWhenever you have an opportunity to give advice to someone you do not miss it. It is not necessary that you are capable of providing this advice; it is not necessary that whatever you are saying is your knowing at all, but when it comes to giving advice, the temptation or the joy of being a teacher is very difficult to overcome.\nWhat is the joy in being a teacher? You suddenly, free of cost, are on the upper side and the other is on the lower side. If someone comes to you for a donation, how difficult you find it to even give a\npenny! The difficulty is that you have to give something from what you have. But in giving guidance, you have no difficulty. Because what difficulty can there be in giving what you do not have? You are losing nothing. On the contrary, you are gaining something – you are gaining joy, you are gaining ego-enhancement; today you are in a position to guide, and the other is at the receiving end. You are on the top, the other is below.\nThis is why I say that, in this Upanishad, there is no pleasure of giving any advice or guidance, rather there is great pain, because what the seer of this Upanishad is giving, he is giving after knowing it. He is sharing something very intimate, very inner.\nThe hints are brief but deep. The hits are very few, but deadly. And, if you are willing, the arrow will pierce your heart directly and will not leave you alive. It will kill you. Therefore, be aware and be alert, because this very business is a dangerous one. You will have to lose what you think you are. In it, there is no way of achieving without losing yourself. Here only those who lose are the achievers.\nThat is also why I have chosen this Upanishad. As it is, I can tell you directly, there is no reason for bringing the Upanishad in – but I will use it as an excuse, a shelter. If you shoot an arrow directly, the person can escape; but if it is hidden behind the Upanishad there are less chances of you missing it. I have selected the Upanishad so that you may not know that I am directly aiming at you. This way the chances of escape are minimized. All hunters know that better hunting is done from a hiding place. This Upanishad is only a hiding place.\nI will say only what I have known, but then there is no difference between that and the Upanishad. Because whatever the seer of this Upanishad has said, he also has known it.\nThis Upanishad is the manifestation of the subtlest mysteries of spirituality. But if I go on talking on the Upanishad only, there is a fear that the talk may remain merely talk. So the talks will be only a background, and along with it there will be experiments. Whatever is said, whatever the seer has seen, or whatever I say, and I have seen – there will be attempts to turn your face, to raise your eyes towards that. The attempt to raise your eyes towards that will be the main thing, the talk on the Upanishad will be only for creating a milieu. Such vibrations can be created all around you so that you forget the twentieth century and arrive in the world of the seer of this Upanishad, so that this world which has become so lusterless and ugly may disappear and the memories may arise of those days in which this seer lived.\nAn atmosphere, a milieu – the Upanishad is only for that. But that is not enough – it is necessary, but not enough.\nSo whatever I say, if you just stop at hearing it I will know you have not heard it at all. Whoever does not set out on the journey after hearing this, I don’t believe he has heard. If you think you have understood just by hearing... do not be in such haste! If it was possible to understand something only by hearing we would have understood long ago. If it was possible to understand something only by hearing there would be no shortage of people with understanding in the world and an ignorant person would be difficult to find. But as it is the world is full of only the ignorant.\nNothing is understood only by listening. By listening we only close our fists on words. Not by listening but by doing one understands. So listen to find the way of doing, not for the understanding. Listen\nin order to do, do in order to understand. Do not come to the conclusion that just by listening you have understood. That intermediary link of doing is necessary. There is no other way. But our mind says, “I have got it; now where is the need to do?”\nDestinations are reached by moving towards them. You may have understood everything, the whole route of your journey may have been memorized by you, you may have a detailed map in your pocket; still, without moving no one ever comes to their destination. But it is possible to dream of having arrived. A person may be asleep right here and can dream of having arrived anywhere. The mind is an expert in dreaming.\nDo not think that only you see such dreams; even those whom you call very intelligent also go on having these dreams. Your saints, your monks and sannyasins – those who have been searching for years – have not come even an inch closer to anywhere. They have not even begun their journey at all and they have been searching for years!\nTheir whole search has been circular. In the mind a circle has been created – a sort of whirlpool. And in that whirlpool they move round and round and ultimately everything gets lost – all the Vedas, the Upanishads, the Korans, the Bibles, everything gets lost, but there is not even an inch of movement.\nWe will discuss the Upanishad – not to make you understand the Upanishad, but for you to become the Upanishad. If by listening you memorize something and begin to repeat it, it means I have harmed you; I did not prove to be your friend. Your repeating what you have heard is of no value. When I can see that the same happens to you as has happened to me, that your eyes also open up – only then have you become the Upanishad.\nUnderstand it this way: a poet sings a song about some flower. There can be a great sweetness, rhythm and music in this song – songs have their own beauty – but howsoever much the song may sing of the flower, yet the song is just a song, it is not the flower, it is not the fragrance of the flower. And if you are satisfied only with that song, then you have gone astray.\nThis Upanishad is a song of a flower that you have not yet seen. The song is wonderful: the singer has seen the flower. But do not be satisfied by the song, the song is not the flower.\nIt also happens that sometimes you too come close to the flower – only sometimes. Sometimes you too get a glimpse of the flower – accidentally, suddenly – because the flower is not foreign to you, it is your very nature. It is very close to you, just by your side. Sometimes it touches you – in spite of you. Sometimes the flower gives you a glimpse, a glimpse like a flash of lightning. In some moment it abruptly enters your experience: you feel that there is something more in this world, that this world that you know is not all that is. In this rocky world there is something else which is not a stone but is a flower – alive and blossoming. And if you have seen it in some dream, or a lightning flash in the dark of night.You see something and it disappears again – thus it happens sometimes in your life.\nIt often happens in the lives of the poets. It often happens in the lives of the painters that a glimpse of the flower comes close by.\nYet, however close to the flower, however great a glimpse you may have had, this closeness is still a distance. No matter how close the flower may come to you, still the distance remains. And even if I can actually touch the flower with my hands, still it is not certain that the experience I am having\nis that of the flower, because the message is coming through my hand. The hand may give a wrong message. There is no certainty of my hand giving the right message: there is no reason to trust my hand implicitly. Again, the message that the hand will give will be less about the flower and more about itself.\nIf the flower feels cold, it is not necessary that the flower is cold – maybe my hand is feverish and that is why the flower is felt to be cold. The message is more about the hand, because whenever a message comes through a medium it is always relative. One cannot be absolutely certain about it.\nI was reading a memoir written by Popov. Popov was a seeker – and an ardent seeker. She was practicing spiritual disciplines with Piotr Dimitrovich Ouspensky. Once she was sitting with Ouspensky and a gentleman came and asked him whether there is a God or not. Ouspensky exclaimed, “God? No, there is no God.” Ouspensky paused a little, and said, “But I cannot say with any guarantee, because whatever I have known is through a medium. Sometimes I have seen through my eyes, but the eyes cannot be relied upon. Sometimes I have heard through my ears, but the ears can hear wrongly. Sometimes I have touched through my hands, but touch cannot be relied upon either. So far I have not seen directly, I have never been face to face. Therefore I cannot say with any guarantee. Whatever I have known so far, it has not given me any experience of God. But that does not prove that there is no God, it only informs you about what my experiences are. So I cannot give you any guarantee that God is not. But do not drop your search and believe me, go on searching for yourself.”\nWhenever something happens through a medium it is not trustworthy. Even if we come very close to a flower, still it is the eyes that see, the hands that touch, and the nose that gathers the fragrance – these are all experiences through our senses. Thus it is that sometimes a poet comes so close to that ultimate flower that its echo descends into his songs. But still he is not a Buddha, not a Mahavira.\nWho is Buddha? Who is Mahavira? Buddha is that consciousness which has become the flower itself; even that much distance, that of seeing the flower, does not exist – consciousness has become the flower.\nOnly by becoming the flower can one fully know what is.\nThese are statements of a seer of the Upanishad. It is like a song about some flower. Go on humming it – there is a lot of sweetness and an exquisite taste in it, but it is not the flower, it is only a song. If you make the effort, you will sometimes see the flower.\nPeople come to me and say, “There was a great light during the meditation, but I lost it again. Infinite light was there, but it disappeared again. There was immense bliss.” But where has it gone now? Now they are searching for it again and cannot find it.\nA glimpse means you had come close. But glimpses are bound to be lost. Meditation can, at the most, give only a glimpse. But do not stop there. Do not get stuck looking for that same glimpse again and again. The only purpose of meditation is that one gets a glimpse. Then one has to go ahead, into samadhi, into enlightenment, so that one becomes the very flower.\nIn meditation is a glimpse; samadhi is being it.\nDo not stop at glimpses. They are very lovely: the whole world starts looking stale – just one glimpse of that living flower, that flowering which is within, and the whole world becomes insipid and meaningless. But then some people catch hold of the glimpses and start repeating them and think everything has happened. No, until you are the divine yourself, do not believe that God is.\nYou can be it, because you already are it. You have only to open up a little, to uncover a little. You are present here and now, just hiding. There are only a few layers of clothes covering you – and they too are very thin – so that if you so desire you can throw them off right now, be free of them, and be the divine. But your clinging is very strong; though the clothes are thin, your grip is very tight. Why is this clinging so strong? The clinging is strong because we think that these clothes are our being, that this is what we are. Other than that we do not know of any other existence.\nIn this Upanishad there will be hints of that existence which is beyond these coverings. And along with this Upanishad we will meditate, so we can get a glimpse. And we will hope for samadhi, enlightenment, so that we become that without which there is no contentment, no peace, and no truth.\nThe Upanishad begins with prayer. The prayer is addressed to the whole universe.\nMAY THE SUN GOD GIVE US HIS BENEDICTION. MAY VARUNA, ARYAMA, INDRA, BRAHASPATI AND VISHNU GIVE US THEIR BENEDICTION. SALUTATIONS TO THAT BRAHMA. O VAYU, SALUTATIONS ESPECIALLY TO YOU BECAUSE YOU ARE THE BRAHMA MANIFEST, I SHALL CALL ONLY YOU THE MANIFEST BRAHMA; THE TRUTH, THE RIT – THE LAW. MAY THEY ALL PROTECT ME AND MY MASTER, THE SPEAKER.\nThe Upanishad begins with this prayer. The journey of religion has begun with a prayer. It has to be so. Prayer means trust and hope. Prayer means our feeling of being one with the whole universe. Prayer means, “How would I be able to manage alone?”\nIf it were possible that you alone could make this happen it would have happened long ago. But by yourself even the trivial could not be achieved. You had desired money, you could not achieve even that. You had wished for position, you could not manage even that. You had all sorts of wishes, large and small, but none were fulfilled. Alone you could not even manage the world: would this great journey of truth be possible by yourself alone? By yourself, you are even defeated in the world.\nEveryone is defeated in this world. Even those who appear to be victorious are also defeated. They only appear victorious to others, in themselves they are utterly defeated. You also appear to yourself as defeated, but to others you appear victorious. There are people behind you who feel that you have achieved, that you have won in the worldly battle. But if we look within man, everyone is defeated.\nThis world is a long story of defeats. Here victory just does not happen. Here victory just cannot happen, it is not in the nature of the world. Defeat is the destiny here. Defeat is not of any individual, not of any person, but the destiny of being in the world is defeat. You will have to accept defeat there. Nobody ever wins there.\nWe could not win in the world where it was all a concern with petty things, where it was just a dream – Shankara calls it maya, an illusion. When we were defeated even in that illusion, in that dreamlike happening, how then can we hope to win on our own in the world of truth?\nPrayer means the realization of a person who has been defeated in the world. When even after trying for lives upon lives he has been defeated in the mundane, what capability can he claim in the matters of the sacred and the absolute?\nHence the prayer. Hence the seer has invoked the whole universe to help him. He has invoked the sun, he has invoked Varuna. All these names are symbolic of the powers of the universe. The sun has been invoked first because the sun is our life. Without him, we wouldn’t be. Within us, it is the sun that lives, burns. If the sun is extinguished there, we will be extinguished here. The sun is our life, hence he has been invoked.\nThe seer says: SALUTATIONS TO VAYU, THE GOD OF AIR – Vayu has been especially saluted in this prayer – BECAUSE YOU ARE THE BRAHMA MANIFEST. It is a bit strange. Think a little. It is very interesting, because Vayu is absolutely unmanifest; all other things are manifest. Had the seer said to the sun, “You are the manifest Brahma” – radiant, burning, hot, living – it would have been understandable. But the seer did not call the sun “manifest Brahma” he said that to Vayu, whom we cannot see at all, who is really unmanifest.\nWhere is that Vayu manifest? We only infer that it is, we only feel that it is, but it cannot be seen. Where is it available to the eye? Manifest means that which can be seen by the eyes. Now, Vayu is not at all available to the eyes. Rocks, mountains, they are all visible, but not Vayu. But the seer says: OH VAYU! SALUTATIONS TO YOU, BECAUSE YOU ARE THE MANIFEST BRAHMA. He said\nso because Vayu, the air, is not visible but still is; it is not seen by the eye, nevertheless it is touching the eye each moment – and the same is the situation with the supreme truth. It is not seen but it is touching us every moment.\nVayu is not seen because we do not have the eyes to see it. Vayu is simply there. Without Vayu we cannot exist. Vayu is in our breath, protecting us, and our very life depends on its inhalation and exhalation. Something which is so near us, which is our very breath, we cannot see, because our eyes are very gross. Whatever is very gross, that is what we see. Whatever is subtle, we are unable to see.\nVayu, the air, is very subtle. It is present before us; it is within us and without us. It is present in every cell of our body – but not visible. That is why it is said: YOU ARE THE MANIFEST BRAHMA – you are just like the Brahma.\nBrahma is present here but not visible. And it is present in our every fiber; in fact, it is the fiber and yet we see no trace of it. That is why Vayu has been saluted, that we know the Vayu, but not the Brahma. A thread of relationship has been attempted, that Brahma is just like Vayu, the air.\n“I will call you the manifest Brahma,” the seer says, “I will also name you the truth and rit, the law, because you are just like that which is and is not known to us; who we ourselves are and yet whom we do not know; who is now and here since eternity and not known by us. But this search may be fulfilled, if all the gods protect us.”\nWhat is meant by gods is the endless number of life-forces since eternity. And life is a vast network of endless numbers of forces. Your existence is also a vast network of these endless powers. Within you meet the sun, Varuna, Indra, Vayu; Agni, the fire; Prithvi, the earth; Akash, the sky – they all\nmeet. If we can know one individual in his totality we have known the whole of the existence in seed form. Everything is there in the individual. Everything has united in him, and in their meeting the individual exists.\nSo prayer is for the help of all these. But will the sun help? That question does arise. Even if the prayers are done will the sun help, or will the Vayu help, or will the earth help? The question is not of the earth’s help or the sun’s help, but that you prayed – that is the great help! Let this be understood properly.\nNo sun is coming to help you, but you prayed and it will affect you, not the sun, because a prayerful mind becomes humble, a prayerful mind becomes helpless, a prayerful mind accepts the fact that alone it cannot accomplish anything; a prayerful mind is ready to dissolve and give up its ego and the feeling that it can do it. And these things bring results.\nThe whole outcome of the prayer is on you. The prayer does not change the sun, but you. And the moment you change, you enter into another world.\nNormally when you pray you think that someone is going to do something for you, and that is why you pray. No, prayer is only a device. Certainly you join your hands in prayer towards someone else, but its consequences happen within you – in the one who has joined hands in prayer.\nThus there are difficulties in understanding it. If you pray in the presence of a scientist: “Oh sun, help me!” the scientists will say, “What nonsense! How can the sun help you? When has the sun ever helped anyone?” Or you pray: “O Indra, bring rains!” and he will say, “Have you gone mad? Have rains ever fallen by prayers?” The scientist is right.\nNeither the sun nor the clouds nor the winds will listen to you. None will listen to you. But the fact that you called out will transform you. How intensely you called will create an equally deep intensity within you. If your whole being calls out, you will become a totally different person.\nThis is what prayer is for. Enough for today.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"6297","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/finger_pointing_to_the_moon/part1/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/finger_pointing_to_the_moon/>Finger Pointing to the Moon</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">1 Don\'t Just Listen, Do</h1><div class=post-meta>30 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;6297 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Finger_Pointing_to_the_Moon/part1.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=_index>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

This version is the final edit pending publication.]</p><p><br></p><p>INVOCATION</p><p><br></p><p>OM, MAY THE SUN GOD GIVE US HIS BENEDICTION.</p><p><br></p><p>MAY VARUNA, THE GOD OF WATER, GIVE US HIS BENEDICTION. MAY ARYAMA,
INDRA, BRAHASPATI AND</p><p>VISHNU GIVE US THEIR BENEDICTION.</p><p><br></p><p>MY SALUTATIONS TO BRAHMA, THE ABSOLUTE REALITY.</p><p><br></p><p>O VAYU, THE GOD OF AIR, SALUTATIONS ESPECIALLY TO YOU, BECAUSE YOU
ARE THE BRAHMA MANIFEST.</p><p><br></p><p>I SHALL CALL ONLY YOU THE MANIFEST BRAHMA.</p><p><br></p><p>I SHALL ALSO CALL YOU THE TRUTH, CALL YOU RIT – THE LAW. MAY THEY
PROTECT ME. MAY THEY PROTECT THE SPEAKER.</p><p>2</p><p>PROTECT ME. PROTECT THE SPEAKER. OM, PEACE, PEACE, PEACE.</p><p>I will say only that which I know. I will say only that which you can
also know. By knowing I mean living it. One may know even without living
it, but such knowledge is a burden; one may sink because of it, but one
cannot be saved by it. Knowing can be alive also. Such knowing renders
us weightless – light so that we can fly in the sky. Only when living
becomes knowing do wings grow, fetters break and the doors to the
infinite become wide open.</p><p><br></p><p>But knowing is difficult; accumulating knowledge is easy. Mind
chooses the easier and avoids the difficult. But the one who avoids the
difficult will miss religion as well. One who wants to avoid not only
the difficult but the impossible too will never ever come close to
religion.</p><p><br></p><p>Religion is only for those who are ready to enter into the
impossible. Religion is for the gamblers, not for the shopkeepers.
Religion is neither a business deal nor a compromise. Religion is a
wager. A gambler puts his wealth at stake; the religious person puts
himself at stake because that is the ultimate wealth.</p><p><br></p><p>One who is not ready to stake his very life will never be able to
know the hidden mysteries of life. Those secrets are not available
cheaply. Knowledge is available very cheaply; knowledge is available
from books, from scriptures, in education, with the teachers. Knowledge
is available almost for free; you do not have to pay anything for it. In
religion you have to pay heavily. It is not right even to say “heavily”
because only when someone stakes everything do the doors to that life
open. The doors to that life open only for those who put this life at
stake. To put this life at stake is the only key to the door of that
life. But knowledge is very cheap, so the mind chooses the easier and
the cheaper way. We learn things – words, doctrines – and think that we
know. Such knowledge only enhances ignorance.</p><p><br></p><p>The ignorant person at least knows that he does not know; at least
that much truth he has. But more untruthful people cannot be found than
those whom we call knowledgeable. They do not even know that they do not
know. Something heard, something committed to memory, deludes them into
thinking they have also known.</p><p><br></p><p>I will say to you only that which I know, because only in saying that
lies some value; because only that which I know can, if you are willing,
vibrate the strings of your heart too with its living impact.</p><p><br></p><p>What I myself do not know, and what is only skin deep in me, cannot
go much deeper in you either. Only that which has entered the depths of
my own heart has the possibility; if you cooperate, it can reach your
heart. Even then your cooperation is a must, because if your heart is
closed there is no way of thrusting the truth forcefully into it. And it
is good that it is so, because if truth can be forcibly inculcated it
cannot become your freedom, it can only become your slavery. All
compulsions become slaveries.</p><p><br></p><p>So in this world, everything can be given to you through force; only
truth cannot be, because truth can never become slavery. The very nature
of truth is freedom. So truth is the only thing in this world which
nobody can give you forcefully, which nobody can thrust upon you, which
cannot be put</p><p>upon you from the outside like clothing; for which your willingness,
your openness, your receptivity, your invitation, your heart full of
gratitude are the prerequisites. If your heart becomes like the earth
before the rainy season when it is thirsty for water and develops wide
cracks due to the parching summer heat – as if it has opened up its lips
here and there anticipating the rains – then the truth enters you.
Otherwise the truth turns back even from your very doorstep. Many times
it has turned back – in many, many lifetimes.</p><p><br></p><p>You are not new – nothing is new on this earth; you are all very old.
You have sat at the feet of Buddha and heard him, you have seen Krishna,
you have also been around Jesus, but still you have missed, because your
heart was never ready. The rivers of Buddha and Mahavira have flowed
past you, but you have remained thirsty.</p><p><br></p><p>The day Buddha was about to leave his body, Ananda was weeping and
beating his chest in desperation. Buddha asked him, “Why are you
weeping? I have been near you for long enough... forty years! And if it
has not happened even in forty years, what is the point of weeping now?
And why are you feeling so troubled about my death?”</p><p><br></p><p>Ananda replied, “I am so distressed because I could not manage to
disappear while you were here. Had I disappeared, you would have been
able to enter me. For forty years the river was flowing by my side and I
have remained thirsty. Now I am weeping because I do not know when and
in what lifetime I shall be able to meet this river again.”</p><p><br></p><p>You are not new. You have cremated Buddhas, you have cremated
Mahaviras – Jesus, Krishna and all; you are living after cremating them
all. They lost the battle against you. You are very old. You have been
here since life is. It has been an infinite journey. Where are we
missing? It is just that you are not open, you are closed.</p><p><br></p><p>I will say to you only that which I have known. If you can make
yourself an opening, you will also know that. And it is not that there
is some great difficulty in it. There is only one difficulty, and that
is you.</p><p><br></p><p>Some people move only with curiosity, just like small children asking
while they are on a walk, “What is the name of this tree?” And if you
don’t reply, they immediately forget that they had asked anything and
they start asking something else: “Why is this rock lying here?” They
ask just for the sake of asking and not in order to know. They do not
ask in order to know, they ask because they cannot remain without
asking.</p><p><br></p><p>Those who are living out of curiosity are still childish. If you ask,
“What is God?” just as casually as a child would ask on seeing a toy
shop on the road, “What is this toy?” you are still a child. And the
child can be forgiven, but not you.</p><p><br></p><p>Curiosity will not do. Religion is not a child’s play. Even if you
are given a reply, it serves no purpose. The child’s fun is in asking.
He could ask, that is his fun. Even if you give him a reply he is not
very interested in it. What is the matter?</p><p><br></p><p>Psychologists say that when children learn to speak for the first
time they are only practicing their speaking by asking; just as when a
child learns walking for the first time, he tries every now and then</p><p>to get up and walk. So children repeat the same sentence again and
again only because they have acquired a new experience, a new dimension
through speaking. So in that new dimension they are floating and
rehearsing – that is why they ask just anything, they say just
anything.</p><p>In the world of religion, if you are also asking just anything,
saying just anything, thinking just anything without any deep desire to
know – only out of curiosity – then you will still cremate some more
buddhas; then who knows how many more buddhas will still have to work
hard on you!</p><p>Truth has no relationship to curiosity.</p><p><br></p><p>Some people move a little ahead of curiosity and become inquisitive.
There is a little more depth in inquisitiveness, but just a little more.
Inquisitiveness is also not very deep, it is shallow as well, for it is
only intellectual. The intellect is the same as scabies: if you scratch
it a bit, it feels good. So the intellect goes on itching: Is there God?
Is there any soul? Is there any salvation? What is meditation? – not
that you want to do it. What is God? – not that you want to know it, but
just for discussion, just for conversation.… It is a mental exercise, an
intellectual entertainment. So people only talk big, they never stake
anything. Whether God is or is not, it is not truly their concern; and
they remain untransformed whether God does exist or does not.</p><p>It is very interesting: one person believes there is a God, another
believes there is no God, and the lives of the two are identical. If
someone is abused, the one who believes there is a God gets angry, and
the one who believes there is no God, he also gets angry. Sometimes it
happens that the one who believes there is a God gets even more angry.
The one who believes there is no God, how much can he do to you? At best
he may abuse you in return, hit you or kill you. But the one who
believes there is a God can send you to rot in the agonies of hell. He
has more ways of becoming angry.</p><p>If belief in God or no belief in God does not bring about any change
in one’s life, it only means that it has no relation to God, it is only
intellectual talk. Such inquisitiveness makes a man a philosopher. He
goes on contemplating and deliberating, he learns the scriptures,
accumulates too many doctrines, is able to think of all the pros and
cons, holds debates, but he never lives.</p><p>If you are also only full of inquisitiveness there will be no journey
at all. People full of inquisitiveness are those who sit near the
milestone and ask, “What is the destination? How far is the
destination?” They continue asking this but never get up and begin to
walk.</p><p>You know so much! What is there that is lacking in your knowing? You
know almost everything – whatever Buddha knew or Mahavira or Krishna
knew you also know. While reading the Gita, don’t you feel you know all
this?</p><p>Yes, you also know, but this is all only in your head. Their seed has
not reached your heart. And the ideas that are only in the mind are like
the seed lying on a stone. The seed is there, lying on the stone, but it
cannot sprout. To sprout, the seed will have to fall down off the stone
and seek the soil. And the surface of the soil is not suitable either,
because more moisture is needed. So it has to move underneath the
surface to where there is some water, where there is some juice
flowing.</p><p>Seeds remain in the mind like those lying on the stone. Until they
fall down into the heart the wet soil is not available. In the heart
some juice flows, some love; there is some water there. If a seed falls
there, it sprouts.</p><p>Inquisitive people have a lot within them; everything is there, but
it is like the seeds lying on the stone. The soil is not far off, but
even this little journey is difficult for them. They are averse to
moving, so the seed remains sitting on the rock. This small journey will
have to be undertaken – that the seed falls down from the stone to the
soil, seeks a place in the soil, finds some wetness, and hides itself a
little inside the soil.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember, whatsoever is to be born in this world needs a deep
silence, solitude and darkness. Those things that are kept in the mind
are kept in the open light. Sprouting is not possible there. The heart
is the wet soil hidden within you. There something can sprout.</p><p><br></p><p>Therefore those who live only in inquisitiveness become scholars and
pundits; knowledgeable, but nothing sprouts within them – no new birth,
no new life, no new flowers, nothing at all.</p><p><br></p><p>There is one more dimension of seeking, we call it mumuksha, a deep
longing for liberation. Here there is no concern for knowing, the
concern is for living. Here there is no concern for knowing, the concern
is for being. The question is not whether there is a God or not, the
question is whether I can be God. There may be a God, but if I cannot
become God then there is no point in it all. The question is not whether
there is any liberation, the question is whether I can also be
liberated. If there is no possibility of my becoming liberated, then
even if there is a liberation somewhere it is meaningless for me. The
issue is not whether there is a soul within or not – there may be, there
may not be – the real issue is whether I can become a soul.</p><p><br></p><p>Mumuksha, the longing for liberation, is a search to be. And when one
wants to be, one has to put oneself at stake. This is why I say religion
is a gambler’s affair.</p><p><br></p><p>I will say only that which I know, which I have lived. If you agree
to put all at stake, whatever is my experience can also become yours.
Experiences do not belong to anyone; whosoever is ready to receive them,
they come to him. Nobody has any right over the truth, whosoever is
willing to disappear inherits it. Truth belongs to one who shows the
readiness to ask for it – who opens the doors of his heart and calls for
it.</p><p><br></p><p>This is why I have chosen this Upanishad. This Upanishad is a direct
encounter with spirituality. There are no siddhants, doctrines, in it;
there are only experiences of siddhas, the fulfilled ones, in it. In it
there is no discussion of that which is born out of curiosity or
inquisitiveness, no, in it there are hints to those who are full of
longing for liberation by those who already have attained
liberation.</p><p><br></p><p>There are some people who have not attained, yet they are unable to
drop the enjoyment of guiding others. Giving guidance is a very
enjoyable thing. In the whole world, the thing that is given the most is
guidance, and the thing least accepted is also guidance. Everybody
gives, nobody takes.</p><p><br></p><p>Whenever you have an opportunity to give advice to someone you do not
miss it. It is not necessary that you are capable of providing this
advice; it is not necessary that whatever you are saying is your knowing
at all, but when it comes to giving advice, the temptation or the joy of
being a teacher is very difficult to overcome.</p><p><br></p><p>What is the joy in being a teacher? You suddenly, free of cost, are
on the upper side and the other is on the lower side. If someone comes
to you for a donation, how difficult you find it to even give a</p><p>penny! The difficulty is that you have to give something from what
you have. But in giving guidance, you have no difficulty. Because what
difficulty can there be in giving what you do not have? You are losing
nothing. On the contrary, you are gaining something – you are gaining
joy, you are gaining ego-enhancement; today you are in a position to
guide, and the other is at the receiving end. You are on the top, the
other is below.</p><p><br></p><p>This is why I say that, in this Upanishad, there is no pleasure of
giving any advice or guidance, rather there is great pain, because what
the seer of this Upanishad is giving, he is giving after knowing it. He
is sharing something very intimate, very inner.</p><p><br></p><p>The hints are brief but deep. The hits are very few, but deadly. And,
if you are willing, the arrow will pierce your heart directly and will
not leave you alive. It will kill you. Therefore, be aware and be alert,
because this very business is a dangerous one. You will have to lose
what you think you are. In it, there is no way of achieving without
losing yourself. Here only those who lose are the achievers.</p><p><br></p><p>That is also why I have chosen this Upanishad. As it is, I can tell
you directly, there is no reason for bringing the Upanishad in – but I
will use it as an excuse, a shelter. If you shoot an arrow directly, the
person can escape; but if it is hidden behind the Upanishad there are
less chances of you missing it. I have selected the Upanishad so that
you may not know that I am directly aiming at you. This way the chances
of escape are minimized. All hunters know that better hunting is done
from a hiding place. This Upanishad is only a hiding place.</p><p><br></p><p>I will say only what I have known, but then there is no difference
between that and the Upanishad. Because whatever the seer of this
Upanishad has said, he also has known it.</p><p><br></p><p>This Upanishad is the manifestation of the subtlest mysteries of
spirituality. But if I go on talking on the Upanishad only, there is a
fear that the talk may remain merely talk. So the talks will be only a
background, and along with it there will be experiments. Whatever is
said, whatever the seer has seen, or whatever I say, and I have seen –
there will be attempts to turn your face, to raise your eyes towards
that. The attempt to raise your eyes towards that will be the main
thing, the talk on the Upanishad will be only for creating a milieu.
Such vibrations can be created all around you so that you forget the
twentieth century and arrive in the world of the seer of this Upanishad,
so that this world which has become so lusterless and ugly may disappear
and the memories may arise of those days in which this seer lived.</p><p><br></p><p>An atmosphere, a milieu – the Upanishad is only for that. But that is
not enough – it is necessary, but not enough.</p><p><br></p><p>So whatever I say, if you just stop at hearing it I will know you
have not heard it at all. Whoever does not set out on the journey after
hearing this, I don’t believe he has heard. If you think you have
understood just by hearing... do not be in such haste! If it was
possible to understand something only by hearing we would have
understood long ago. If it was possible to understand something only by
hearing there would be no shortage of people with understanding in the
world and an ignorant person would be difficult to find. But as it is
the world is full of only the ignorant.</p><p><br></p><p>Nothing is understood only by listening. By listening we only close
our fists on words. Not by listening but by doing one understands. So
listen to find the way of doing, not for the understanding. Listen</p><p>in order to do, do in order to understand. Do not come to the
conclusion that just by listening you have understood. That intermediary
link of doing is necessary. There is no other way. But our mind says, “I
have got it; now where is the need to do?”</p><p><br></p><p>Destinations are reached by moving towards them. You may have
understood everything, the whole route of your journey may have been
memorized by you, you may have a detailed map in your pocket; still,
without moving no one ever comes to their destination. But it is
possible to dream of having arrived. A person may be asleep right here
and can dream of having arrived anywhere. The mind is an expert in
dreaming.</p><p><br></p><p>Do not think that only you see such dreams; even those whom you call
very intelligent also go on having these dreams. Your saints, your monks
and sannyasins – those who have been searching for years – have not come
even an inch closer to anywhere. They have not even begun their journey
at all and they have been searching for years!</p><p><br></p><p>Their whole search has been circular. In the mind a circle has been
created – a sort of whirlpool. And in that whirlpool they move round and
round and ultimately everything gets lost – all the Vedas, the
Upanishads, the Korans, the Bibles, everything gets lost, but there is
not even an inch of movement.</p><p><br></p><p>We will discuss the Upanishad – not to make you understand the
Upanishad, but for you to become the Upanishad. If by listening you
memorize something and begin to repeat it, it means I have harmed you; I
did not prove to be your friend. Your repeating what you have heard is
of no value. When I can see that the same happens to you as has happened
to me, that your eyes also open up – only then have you become the
Upanishad.</p><p><br></p><p>Understand it this way: a poet sings a song about some flower. There
can be a great sweetness, rhythm and music in this song – songs have
their own beauty – but howsoever much the song may sing of the flower,
yet the song is just a song, it is not the flower, it is not the
fragrance of the flower. And if you are satisfied only with that song,
then you have gone astray.</p><p><br></p><p>This Upanishad is a song of a flower that you have not yet seen. The
song is wonderful: the singer has seen the flower. But do not be
satisfied by the song, the song is not the flower.</p><p><br></p><p>It also happens that sometimes you too come close to the flower –
only sometimes. Sometimes you too get a glimpse of the flower –
accidentally, suddenly – because the flower is not foreign to you, it is
your very nature. It is very close to you, just by your side. Sometimes
it touches you – in spite of you. Sometimes the flower gives you a
glimpse, a glimpse like a flash of lightning. In some moment it abruptly
enters your experience: you feel that there is something more in this
world, that this world that you know is not all that is. In this rocky
world there is something else which is not a stone but is a flower –
alive and blossoming. And if you have seen it in some dream, or a
lightning flash in the dark of night.<span class=s4></span>You see
something and it disappears again – thus it happens sometimes in your
life.</p><p>It often happens in the lives of the poets. It often happens in the
lives of the painters that a glimpse of the flower comes close by.</p><p><br></p><p>Yet, however close to the flower, however great a glimpse you may
have had, this closeness is still a distance. No matter how close the
flower may come to you, still the distance remains. And even if I can
actually touch the flower with my hands, still it is not certain that
the experience I am having</p><p>is that of the flower, because the message is coming through my hand.
The hand may give a wrong message. There is no certainty of my hand
giving the right message: there is no reason to trust my hand
implicitly. Again, the message that the hand will give will be less
about the flower and more about itself.</p><p><br></p><p>If the flower feels cold, it is not necessary that the flower is cold
– maybe my hand is feverish and that is why the flower is felt to be
cold. The message is more about the hand, because whenever a message
comes through a medium it is always relative. One cannot be absolutely
certain about it.</p><p><br></p><p>I was reading a memoir written by Popov. Popov was a seeker – and an
ardent seeker. She was practicing spiritual disciplines with Piotr
Dimitrovich Ouspensky. Once she was sitting with Ouspensky and a
gentleman came and asked him whether there is a God or not. Ouspensky
exclaimed, “God? No, there is no God.” Ouspensky paused a little, and
said, “But I cannot say with any guarantee, because whatever I have
known is through a medium. Sometimes I have seen through my eyes, but
the eyes cannot be relied upon. Sometimes I have heard through my ears,
but the ears can hear wrongly. Sometimes I have touched through my
hands, but touch cannot be relied upon either. So far I have not seen
directly, I have never been face to face. Therefore I cannot say with
any guarantee. Whatever I have known so far, it has not given me any
experience of God. But that does not prove that there is no God, it only
informs you about what my experiences are. So I cannot give you any
guarantee that God is not. But do not drop your search and believe me,
go on searching for yourself.”</p><p><br></p><p>Whenever something happens through a medium it is not trustworthy.
Even if we come very close to a flower, still it is the eyes that see,
the hands that touch, and the nose that gathers the fragrance – these
are all experiences through our senses. Thus it is that sometimes a poet
comes so close to that ultimate flower that its echo descends into his
songs. But still he is not a Buddha, not a Mahavira.</p><p><br></p><p>Who is Buddha? Who is Mahavira? Buddha is that consciousness which
has become the flower itself; even that much distance, that of seeing
the flower, does not exist – consciousness has become the flower.</p><p><br></p><p>Only by becoming the flower can one fully know what is.</p><p><br></p><p>These are statements of a seer of the Upanishad. It is like a song
about some flower. Go on humming it – there is a lot of sweetness and an
exquisite taste in it, but it is not the flower, it is only a song. If
you make the effort, you will sometimes see the flower.</p><p><br></p><p>People come to me and say, “There was a great light during the
meditation, but I lost it again. Infinite light was there, but it
disappeared again. There was immense bliss.” But where has it gone now?
Now they are searching for it again and cannot find it.</p><p><br></p><p>A glimpse means you had come close. But glimpses are bound to be
lost. Meditation can, at the most, give only a glimpse. But do not stop
there. Do not get stuck looking for that same glimpse again and again.
The only purpose of meditation is that one gets a glimpse. Then one has
to go ahead, into samadhi, into enlightenment, so that one becomes the
very flower.</p><p><br></p><p>In meditation is a glimpse; samadhi is being it.</p><p>Do not stop at glimpses. They are very lovely: the whole world starts
looking stale – just one glimpse of that living flower, that flowering
which is within, and the whole world becomes insipid and meaningless.
But then some people catch hold of the glimpses and start repeating them
and think everything has happened. No, until you are the divine
yourself, do not believe that God is.</p><p>You can be it, because you already are it. You have only to open up a
little, to uncover a little. You are present here and now, just hiding.
There are only a few layers of clothes covering you – and they too are
very thin – so that if you so desire you can throw them off right now,
be free of them, and be the divine. But your clinging is very strong;
though the clothes are thin, your grip is very tight. Why is this
clinging so strong? The clinging is strong because we think that these
clothes are our being, that this is what we are. Other than that we do
not know of any other existence.</p><p>In this Upanishad there will be hints of that existence which is
beyond these coverings. And along with this Upanishad we will meditate,
so we can get a glimpse. And we will hope for samadhi, enlightenment, so
that we become that without which there is no contentment, no peace, and
no truth.</p><p>The Upanishad begins with prayer. The prayer is addressed to the
whole universe.</p><p><br></p><p>MAY THE SUN GOD GIVE US HIS BENEDICTION. MAY VARUNA, ARYAMA, INDRA,
BRAHASPATI AND VISHNU GIVE US THEIR BENEDICTION. SALUTATIONS TO THAT
BRAHMA. O VAYU, SALUTATIONS ESPECIALLY TO YOU BECAUSE YOU ARE THE BRAHMA
MANIFEST, I SHALL CALL ONLY YOU THE MANIFEST BRAHMA; THE TRUTH, THE RIT
– THE LAW. MAY THEY ALL PROTECT ME AND MY MASTER, THE SPEAKER.</p><p>The Upanishad begins with this prayer. The journey of religion has
begun with a prayer. It has to be so. Prayer means trust and hope.
Prayer means our feeling of being one with the whole universe. Prayer
means, “How would I be able to manage alone?”</p><p>If it were possible that you alone could make this happen it would
have happened long ago. But by yourself even the trivial could not be
achieved. You had desired money, you could not achieve even that. You
had wished for position, you could not manage even that. You had all
sorts of wishes, large and small, but none were fulfilled. Alone you
could not even manage the world: would this great journey of truth be
possible by yourself alone? By yourself, you are even defeated in the
world.</p><p>Everyone is defeated in this world. Even those who appear to be
victorious are also defeated. They only appear victorious to others, in
themselves they are utterly defeated. You also appear to yourself as
defeated, but to others you appear victorious. There are people behind
you who feel that you have achieved, that you have won in the worldly
battle. But if we look within man, everyone is defeated.</p><p>This world is a long story of defeats. Here victory just does not
happen. Here victory just cannot happen, it is not in the nature of the
world. Defeat is the destiny here. Defeat is not of any individual, not
of any person, but the destiny of being in the world is defeat. You will
have to accept defeat there. Nobody ever wins there.</p><p>We could not win in the world where it was all a concern with petty
things, where it was just a dream – Shankara calls it maya, an illusion.
When we were defeated even in that illusion, in that dreamlike
happening, how then can we hope to win on our own in the world of
truth?</p><p>Prayer means the realization of a person who has been defeated in the
world. When even after trying for lives upon lives he has been defeated
in the mundane, what capability can he claim in the matters of the
sacred and the absolute?</p><p><br></p><p>Hence the prayer. Hence the seer has invoked the whole universe to
help him. He has invoked the sun, he has invoked Varuna. All these names
are symbolic of the powers of the universe. The sun has been invoked
first because the sun is our life. Without him, we wouldn’t be. Within
us, it is the sun that lives, burns. If the sun is extinguished there,
we will be extinguished here. The sun is our life, hence he has been
invoked.</p><p><br></p><p>The seer says: SALUTATIONS TO VAYU, THE GOD OF AIR – Vayu has been
especially saluted in this prayer – BECAUSE YOU ARE THE BRAHMA MANIFEST.
It is a bit strange. Think a little. It is very interesting, because
Vayu is absolutely unmanifest; all other things are manifest. Had the
seer said to the sun, “You are the manifest Brahma” – radiant, burning,
hot, living – it would have been understandable. But the seer did not
call the sun “manifest Brahma” he said that to Vayu, whom we cannot see
at all, who is really unmanifest.</p><p><br></p><p>Where is that Vayu manifest? We only infer that it is, we only feel
that it is, but it cannot be seen. Where is it available to the eye?
Manifest means that which can be seen by the eyes. Now, Vayu is not at
all available to the eyes. Rocks, mountains, they are all visible, but
not Vayu. But the seer says: OH VAYU! SALUTATIONS TO YOU, BECAUSE YOU
ARE THE MANIFEST BRAHMA. He said</p><p>so because Vayu, the air, is not visible but still is; it is not seen
by the eye, nevertheless it is touching the eye each moment – and the
same is the situation with the supreme truth. It is not seen but it is
touching us every moment.</p><p><br></p><p>Vayu is not seen because we do not have the eyes to see it. Vayu is
simply there. Without Vayu we cannot exist. Vayu is in our breath,
protecting us, and our very life depends on its inhalation and
exhalation. Something which is so near us, which is our very breath, we
cannot see, because our eyes are very gross. Whatever is very gross,
that is what we see. Whatever is subtle, we are unable to see.</p><p><br></p><p>Vayu, the air, is very subtle. It is present before us; it is within
us and without us. It is present in every cell of our body – but not
visible. That is why it is said: YOU ARE THE MANIFEST BRAHMA – you are
just like the Brahma.</p><p><br></p><p>Brahma is present here but not visible. And it is present in our
every fiber; in fact, it is the fiber and yet we see no trace of it.
That is why Vayu has been saluted, that we know the Vayu, but not the
Brahma. A thread of relationship has been attempted, that Brahma is just
like Vayu, the air.</p><p><br></p><p>“I will call you the manifest Brahma,” the seer says, “I will also
name you the truth and rit, the law, because you are just like that
which is and is not known to us; who we ourselves are and yet whom we do
not know; who is now and here since eternity and not known by us. But
this search may be fulfilled, if all the gods protect us.”</p><p><br></p><p>What is meant by gods is the endless number of life-forces since
eternity. And life is a vast network of endless numbers of forces. Your
existence is also a vast network of these endless powers. Within you
meet the sun, Varuna, Indra, Vayu; Agni, the fire; Prithvi, the earth;
Akash, the sky – they all</p><p>meet. If we can know one individual in his totality we have known the
whole of the existence in seed form. Everything is there in the
individual. Everything has united in him, and in their meeting the
individual exists.</p><p><br></p><p>So prayer is for the help of all these. But will the sun help? That
question does arise. Even if the prayers are done will the sun help, or
will the Vayu help, or will the earth help? The question is not of the
earth’s help or the sun’s help, but that you prayed – that is the great
help! Let this be understood properly.</p><p><br></p><p>No sun is coming to help you, but you prayed and it will affect you,
not the sun, because a prayerful mind becomes humble, a prayerful mind
becomes helpless, a prayerful mind accepts the fact that alone it cannot
accomplish anything; a prayerful mind is ready to dissolve and give up
its ego and the feeling that it can do it. And these things bring
results.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole outcome of the prayer is on you. The prayer does not change
the sun, but you. And the moment you change, you enter into another
world.</p><p><br></p><p>Normally when you pray you think that someone is going to do
something for you, and that is why you pray. No, prayer is only a
device. Certainly you join your hands in prayer towards someone else,
but its consequences happen within you – in the one who has joined hands
in prayer.</p><p><br></p><p>Thus there are difficulties in understanding it. If you pray in the
presence of a scientist: “Oh sun, help me!” the scientists will say,
“What nonsense! How can the sun help you? When has the sun ever helped
anyone?” Or you pray: “O Indra, bring rains!” and he will say, “Have you
gone mad? Have rains ever fallen by prayers?” The scientist is
right.</p><p><br></p><p>Neither the sun nor the clouds nor the winds will listen to you. None
will listen to you. But the fact that you called out will transform you.
How intensely you called will create an equally deep intensity within
you. If your whole being calls out, you will become a totally different
person.</p><p><br></p><p>This is what prayer is for. Enough for today.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=_index>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

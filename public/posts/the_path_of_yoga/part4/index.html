As man is, he cannot exist without self-deception.\nNietzsche says somewhere that man cannot live with the true: he needs dreams, he needs illusions, he needs lies to exist. And Nietzsche is right. As man is, he cannot exist with the truth. This has to be understood very deeply, because without understanding this, there can be no entry into the inquiry which is called Yoga.\nThe mind has to be understood deeply – the mind which needs lies, the mind which needs illusions, the mind which cannot exist with the real, the mind which needs dreams. You are not only dreaming in the night; even while awake you are continuously dreaming. You may be looking at me, you may be listening to me, but a dream current continuously goes on within you. The mind is creating dreams, images, fantasies.\nNow scientists say that a man can live without sleep but he cannot live without dreams. In the old days it was understood that sleep was a necessity, but now modern research says sleep is not really a necessity; sleep is needed only so that you can dream. Dreaming is the necessity. If you are allowed to sleep but not allowed to dream, you will not feel fresh, alive, in the morning. You will feel tired, as if you have not been able to sleep at all.\nIn the night there are periods for deep sleep and periods for dreaming. There is a rhythm, just like day and night. There is a rhythm: in the beginning you fall into deep sleep for nearabout forty, forty-five minutes, then the dream phase comes in; then you dream; then again dreamless sleep, then again dreaming. This goes on the whole night. If your sleep is disturbed while you are deeply asleep without dreaming, when you wake in the morning you will not feel that you have missed anything. But if your dream is disturbed while you are dreaming, in the morning you will feel completely tired, exhausted.\nNow this can be observed from the outside. If someone is sleeping you can judge whether he is dreaming or asleep. If he is dreaming his eyes will be continuously moving, as if he is seeing something with closed eyes. When he is fast asleep the eyes will not move; they will remain steady. So if your sleep is disturbed while your eyes are moving, in the morning you will feel tired. While your eyes are not moving sleep can be disturbed; in the morning you will not feel anything is missing.\nMany researchers have proved that the human mind feeds on dreams; dreaming is a necessity, and dreaming is total auto-deception. And this is so not\nonly in the night: while awake also the same pattern follows. Even in the day you can notice that sometimes there will be dreams floating in the mind, sometimes there will be no dreams.\nWhen there are dreams you will be doing something but you will be absent. Inside you are occupied. For example, you are here. If your mind is passing through a dream-state you will listen to me without listening at all, because your mind will be occupied within. You can only listen to me if you are not in a dreaming state.\nDay and night, mind goes on moving from no-dream to dream, then from dream to no-dream again. This is an inner rhythm. Not only do we continuously dream, in life also we project hopes into the future.\nThe present is almost always a hell: you can endure this hell only because of the hope that you have projected into the future. You can live today because of tomorrow. You are hoping something is going to happen tomorrow – the doors of paradise will open tomorrow. They never open today, and when tomorrow comes it will not come as tomorrow, it will come as today, but by that time your mind has moved again. You go on moving ahead of yourself: this is what dreaming means. You are not one with the real, that which is nearby, that which is here and now, you are somewhere else, moving ahead, jumping ahead.\nYou have named that tomorrow, that future, in many ways. Some people call it heaven, some people call it moksha, but it is always in the future. Somebody is thinking in terms of wealth, but that wealth is going to be in the future. And somebody is thinking in terms of paradise, and that paradise is going to be after you are dead, far away in the future. You waste your present for that which is not: this is what dreaming means. You cannot be here and now. To be just in the moment seems to be arduous.\nYou can be in the past, because again that is dreaming – memories, remembrance of things which are no more – or you can be in the future, which is projection, which again is creating something out of the past. The future is nothing but the past projected again. It may be more colorful, more beautiful, more pleasant, but it is the past refined.\nYou cannot think anything other than the past: the future is nothing but the past projected again. Future and past are not; the present is, but you are never in the present. This is what dreaming means. Nietzsche is right when he says that man cannot live with the truth. He needs lies, he lives through lies. Nietzsche says that we go on saying that we want the truth, but no one wants it. Our so-called truths are nothing but lies, beautiful lies. No one is ready to see the naked reality.\nThis mind cannot enter on the path of Yoga because Yoga is a methodology\nto reveal the truth. Yoga is a method to come to a non-dreaming mind. Yoga is the science to be in the here and now. Yoga means that now you are ready not to move into the future. Yoga means now you are ready not to hope, not to jump ahead of your being. Yoga means to encounter the reality as it is.\nOne can enter Yoga, or the path of Yoga, only when he is totally frustrated with his own mind as it is. If you are still hoping that you can gain something through your mind, Yoga is not for you. A total frustration is needed – the revelation that the mind which projects is futile, the mind that hopes is nonsense, it leads nowhere. It simply closes your eyes, it intoxicates you, it never allows reality to be revealed to you. It protects you against reality.\nYour mind is a drug. It is against that which is. So you can enter on the path only if you are totally frustrated with your mind, with your way of being, with the way you have existed up to now, and you can drop it unconditionally.\nMany become interested but very few enter, because that interest may be just because of the mind. You may be hoping that now, through Yoga, you may gain something. The achieving motive is there with the hope that you may become perfect through Yoga, you may reach to the blissful state of perfect being, that you may become one with the brahman that you may achieve the satchitananda. This may be why you are interested in Yoga. If this is the cause then there can be no meeting between you and the path which is Yoga. Then you are totally against it, moving in a totally opposite dimension.\nYoga means: “Now no hope, now no future, now no desires. But I am ready to know what is. I am not interested in what can be, what should be, what ought to be. I am not interested! I am interested only in that which is.” Because only the real can free you, only the reality can become liberation.\nTotal despair is needed. That despair Buddha called dukkha. If you are really in misery don’t hope, because your hope will only prolong the misery. Your hope is a drug. It can help you to continue, but where are you moving? It will help you to reach only death and nowhere else. All your hopes can lead you only to death; they are leading.\nBecome totally hopeless – no future, no hope. It is difficult; it needs courage to face the real. But such a moment comes to everyone, sometime or other. A moment comes to every human being when he feels total hopelessness. Absolute meaninglessness happens to him. When he becomes aware that whatsoever he is doing is useless, wheresoever he is going is going to nowhere, and all life is meaningless, then hopes drop. Future drops, and for the first time he is in tune with the present, for the first time he is face to face with reality.\nUnless this moment comes to you, you can go on doing asanas, postures, but that is not Yoga. Yoga is an inward turning, a total about-turn. When you\nare not moving into the future, not moving towards the past, then you start moving within yourself, because your being is here and now, it is not in the future. You are present here and now, you can enter this reality. But then mind has to be here.\nThis moment is indicated by the first sutra of Patanjali. Before we talk about the first sutra, a few other things have to be understood.\nYoga is not a religion, remember that. Yoga is not Hindu, it is not Mohammedan. Yoga is a pure science just like mathematics, physics or chemistry. Physics is not Christian, physics is not Buddhist. Christians may have discovered the laws of physics, but physics is not Christian. It is just accidental that Christians have come to discover the laws of physics. Physics remains just a science. Yoga is a science; it is just accidental that Hindus discovered it. It is not Hindu. It is pure mathematics of the inner being. A Mohammedan can be a yogi, a Christian can be a yogi, a Jaina, a Buddhist can be a yogi.\nYoga is pure science. And Patanjali is the greatest name in the world of Yoga. This man is rare; there is no other name comparable to Patanjali. For the first time in the history of humanity this man brought religion to the state of science. He made religion a science; a religion of pure laws, no belief is needed.\nSo-called religions need beliefs. There is no other difference between one religion and another except the difference of beliefs. A Mohammedan has certain beliefs, a Hindu certain others, a Christian certain others. The difference is of beliefs. Yoga has nothing as far as belief is concerned; Yoga doesn’t say to believe in anything. Yoga says to experience. Just as science says to experiment, Yoga says to experience. Experiment and experience are both the same; their directions are different. Experiment means there is something you can do outside; experience means there is something you can do inside. Experience is an inner experiment.\nScience says, “Don’t believe, doubt as much as you can,” but also, “Don’t disbelieve” – because disbelief is again a sort of belief. You can believe in God, you can believe in the concept of no-God. You can say that God exists with a fanatic attitude and you can say quite the reverse, that God exists not, with the same fanaticism. Atheists, theists, are all believers, and belief is not the realm of science. Science means to experience something, that which is; no belief is needed.\nThe second thing to remember is that Yoga is existential, experiential, experimental; no belief is required, no faith is needed. Only the courage to experience is needed, and that is what is lacking. You can believe easily\nbecause in belief you are not going to be transformed. Belief is something added to you, something superficial. Your being is not changed, you are not passing through some mutation. You may be a Hindu one day and become a Christian the next day, simply by changing the Gita for a Bible. You can change it for a Koran, but the man who was holding the Gita and is now holding the Bible remains the same; he has just changed his beliefs.\nBeliefs are like clothes. Nothing substantial is transformed, you remain the same. Dissect a Hindu, dissect a Mohammedan – inside they are the same. The Hindu goes to a temple, the Mohammedan hates the temple. The Mohammedan goes to the mosque and the Hindu hates the mosque but inside they are the same human beings.\nBelief is easy because you are not really required to do anything, just a superficial dressing, a decoration, something which you can put aside any moment you like. Yoga is not belief; that’s why it is difficult, arduous, sometimes it seems impossible. It is an existential approach. You will come to the truth not through belief but through your own experience, through your own realization. That means you will have to be totally changed – your viewpoints, your way of life, your mind; your psyche as it is has to be shattered completely. Something new has to be created. Only with that new will you come in contact with the reality.\nYoga is both a death and a new life. As you are you will have to die, and unless you die the new cannot be born. The new is hidden in you. You are just a seed for it and the seed must fall down, be absorbed by the earth. The seed must die, only then will the new arise out of you. Your death will become your new life. Yoga is both a death and a new birth. Unless you are ready to die you cannot be reborn. So it is not a question of changing beliefs.\nYoga is not a philosophy. I say it is not a religion and I say it is not a philosophy. It is not something you can think about. It is something you will have to be; thinking won’t do. Thinking goes on in your head. It is not really deep into the roots of your being, it is not your totality, it is just a part, a functional part. It can be trained and you can argue logically, you can think rationally, but your heart will remain the same. Your heart is your deepest center, your head is just a branch. You can be without the head but you cannot be without the heart. Your head is not basic.\nYoga is concerned with your total being, with your roots. It is not philosophical. So with Patanjali we will not be thinking, speculating. With Patanjali we will be trying to know the ultimate laws of being, the laws for its transformation, the laws of how to die and how to be reborn again, the laws for a new order of being. That is why I call it a science.\nPatanjali is rare. He is an enlightened person like Buddha, like Krishna, like Christ, like Mahavira, Mohammed, Zarathustra, but he is different in one way. Buddha, Krishna, Mahavira, Zarathustra, Mohammed – none of them has a scientific attitude. They are great founders of religions. They have changed the whole pattern of the human mind and its structure, but their approach is not scientific.\nPatanjali is like an Einstein in the world of buddhas. He is a phenomenon. He could easily have been a Nobel Prize winner like an Einstein or Bohr or Max Planck or Heisenberg. He has the same attitude, the same approach as a rigorous, scientific mind. He is not a poet; Krishna is a poet. He is not a moralist; Mahavira is a moralist. Patanjali is basically a scientist who is thinking in terms of laws. And he has come to deduce absolute laws of the human being, the ultimate working structure of the human mind and of reality.\nIf you follow Patanjali you will come to know that he is as exact as any mathematical formula. Simply do what he says and the result will happen. The result is bound to happen – it is just like two plus two equals four or like heating water to one hundred degrees causes it to evaporate. No belief is needed, you simply do it and know; it is something to be done and known. That’s why I say there is no comparison: never has another man like Patanjali existed on this earth.\nYou can find poetry in Buddha’s utterances; it is bound to be there. Many times while Buddha is expressing himself he becomes poetic. The realm of ecstasy, the realm of ultimate knowing is so beautiful, the temptation is strong to become poetic, the beauty is such, the benediction is such, the bliss is such that one starts talking in poetic language.\nBut Patanjali resists that. It is very difficult to resist, no one else has been able to. Jesus, Krishna, Buddha all became poetic. When the splendor, the beauty, explode within you, you will start dancing, you will start singing. In that state you are just like a lover who has fallen in love with the whole universe.\nPatanjali resists that. He will not use poetry; he will not even use a single poetic symbol. He will not do anything with poetry. He will not talk in terms of beauty: he will talk in terms of mathematics, he will be exact. He will give you maxims, but those maxims are just indications of what is to be done. He will not explode into ecstasy, he will not say things that cannot be said, he will not try the impossible. He will just put down the foundation and if you follow the foundation you will reach the peak which is beyond. He is a rigorous mathematician, remember this.\nThe first sutra:\nNow the discipline of Yoga. Athayoganushasanam: Now the discipline of Yoga.\nEach single word has to be understood, because Patanjali will not use a single superfluous word.\nNow the discipline of Yoga. First try to understand the wordnow. This “now” is an indication to the state of mind I was just talking to you about.\nIf you are disillusioned, if you are hopeless, if you have completely become aware of the futility of all desires; if you see your life as meaningless; whatsoever you have been doing up to now has simply fallen dead, nothing remains in the future, you are in absolute despair – what Kierkegaard calls anguish – you are in anguish, suffering, not knowing what to do, not knowing where to go, not knowing to whom to turn, just on the verge of madness or suicide or death, your whole pattern of life has suddenly become futile; if this moment has come, Patanjali says: Now the discipline of Yoga – only now can you understand the science of Yoga, the discipline of Yoga.\nIf that moment has not come you can go on studying Yoga, and you can become a great scholar but you will not be a yogi. You can write theses on it, you can give discourses on it, but you will not be a yogi. The moment has not come for you. Intellectually you can become interested, through your mind you can be related to Yoga, but Yoga is nothing if it is not a discipline. Yoga is not a shastra; it is not a scripture. It is a discipline; it is something you have to do. It is not curiosity, it is not philosophical speculation, it is deeper than that. It is a question of life and death.\nIf the moment has come when you feel that all directions have become confused, all roads have disappeared, the future is dark and every desire has become bitter and through every desire you have known only disappointment, all movement into hopes and dreams has ceased: Now the discipline of Yoga.\nThis “now” may not have come. Then I may go on talking about Yoga but you will not listen. You can listen only if the moment is present in you. Are you really dissatisfied? Everybody will say yes, but that dissatisfaction is not real. You are dissatisfied with this, you may be dissatisfied with that, but you are not totally dissatisfied. You are still hoping. You are dissatisfied because of your past hopes but you are still hoping for the future. Your dissatisfaction is not total: you are still hankering for some satisfaction somewhere, for some gratification somewhere.\nSometimes you feel hopeless but that hopelessness is not true. You feel hopeless because certain hopes have not been achieved, certain hopes have fallen away, but hoping is still there, hoping has not fallen away. You will still\nhope. You are dissatisfied with this hope, that hope, but you are not dissatisfied with hope as such. If you are disappointed with hope as such the moment has come, and then you can enter Yoga. And then this entry will not be an entering into a mental, speculative phenomenon. This entry will be an entry into a discipline.\nWhat is discipline? Discipline means creating an order within you. As you are, you are a chaos. As you are, you are totally disorderly. Gurdjieff used to say – and Gurdjieff is in many ways like Patanjali, he was again trying to make the core of religion a science – Gurdjieff said that you are not one, you are a crowd; not even when you say “I” is there any I. There are many I’s in you, many egos. In the morning one I, in the afternoon another I, in the evening a third I, but you never become aware of this mess – because who will become aware of it? There is not a center that can become aware.\n…the discipline of Yoga means Yoga wants to create a crystallized center in you. As you are, you are a crowd and a crowd has many phenomena. One is that you cannot believe a crowd. Gurdjieff used to say that man cannot promise: who will promise? You are not there. If you promise who will fulfill the promise? Next morning the one who promised is not there.\nPeople come to me and they say, “Now I will take the vow. I promise to do this,” and I tell them, “Think twice before you promise something. Are you confident that the next moment the one who promised it will be there?” You decide that starting tomorrow you will get up early in the morning at four o’clock, and at four o’clock somebody in you says, “Don’t bother. It is so cold outside. And why are you in such a hurry? We can do it tomorrow” – and you fall asleep again. When you get up you repent and you think, “This is not good. I should have done it.” You decide again, “Tomorrow I will do it”; and the same is going to happen tomorrow because at four in the morning the one who promised is no longer there, somebody else is in the chair. You are a Rotary Club: the chairman goes on changing and every member becomes a Rotary chairman. There is rotation: every moment someone else is the master.\nGurdjieff used to say, “This is the chief characteristic of man – that he cannot promise.” You cannot fulfill a promise. You go on giving promises, and you know well that you cannot fulfill them because you are not one; you are a disorder, a chaos. Hence Patanjali says: Now the discipline of Yoga. If your life has become an absolute misery, if you have realized that whatsoever you do creates hell, then the moment has come. This moment can change your dimension, your direction of being.\nUp until now you have lived as a chaos, a crowd. Yoga means now you will have to be a harmony, you will have to become one. A crystallization is needed,\na centering is needed. And unless you attain a center all that you do is useless; it is wasting life and time. A center is the first necessity, and only a person who has a center can be blissful. Everybody asks for it, but you cannot ask for it, you have to earn it! Everybody hankers for a blissful state of being, but only a center can be blissful, a crowd cannot be blissful. A crowd has no self, there is no atman. Who is going to be blissful?\nBliss means absolute silence, and silence is possible only when there is harmony, when all the discordant fragments have become one, when there is no crowd, only one. When you are alone in the house and nobody else is there, you will be blissful. Right now everybody else is in your house, you are not there. Only the guests are there, the host is always absent, and only the host can be blissful.\nThis centering Patanjali calls discipline, anushasanam. The word discipline is beautiful. It comes from the same root as the word disciple. Discipline means the capacity to learn, the capacity to know. But you cannot know, you cannot learn unless you have attained the capacity to be.\nA man once went to Buddha and he said – he must have been a social reformer, a revolutionary – he said to Buddha, “The world is in misery. I agree with you.”\nBuddha has never said that the world is in misery. Buddha says you are the misery, not the world; life is misery, not the world; man is misery, not the world; mind is misery, not the world. But that revolutionary said, “The world is in misery, I agree with you. Now tell me, what can I do? I have a deep compassion and I want to serve humanity.”\nService must have been his motto! Buddha looked at him and remained silent. Buddha’s disciple, Ananda, said, “This man seems to be sincere. Guide him. Why are you silent?”\nThen Buddha said to that revolutionary, “You want to serve the world, but where are you? I don’t see anyone inside. I look in you, and there is no one. You don’t have any center, and unless you are centered whatsoever you do will create more mischief.”\nAll your social reformers, your revolutionaries, your leaders, are the great mischief creators, mischief-mongers. The world would be better if there were no leaders. But they cannot help: they must do something because the world is in misery and they are not centered, so whatsoever they do will create more misery. Compassion alone will not help, service alone will not help. Compassion through a centered being is something totally different.\nCompassion through a crowd is mischief; that compassion is poison.\nNow the discipline of Yoga.\nDiscipline means the capacity to be, the capacity to know, the capacity to learn. We must understand these three things.\nThe capacity to be… All the Yoga postures are not really concerned with the body, they are concerned with the capacity to be. Patanjali says if you can sit silently without moving your body for a few hours, you are growing in the capacity to be. Why do you move? You cannot sit without moving even for a few seconds: your body starts moving, somewhere you feel itching, the legs go dead, many things start happening – these are just excuses for you to move.\nYou are not a master. You cannot say to the body, “Now I will not move for one hour.” The body will revolt immediately! Immediately it will force you to move, to do something. And it will give reasons: “You have to move because an insect is biting.” You may not find the insect when you look. You are not a being, you are a trembling, a continuous hectic activity. Patanjali’s asanas, postures, are not really concerned with any kind of physiological training but with an inner training of being: just to be, without doing anything, without any movement, without any activity. Just remain – that remaining will help centering.\nIf you can remain in one posture the body will become a slave; it will follow you. And the more the body follows you the more you will have a greater being within you, a stronger being within you. Remember, if the body is not moving your mind cannot move, because mind and body are not two things, they are two poles of one phenomenon. You are not body and mind, you are bodymind. Your personality is psychosomatic, bodymind, both. Mind is the most subtle part of the body, or you can say the reverse, that body is the grossest part of the mind. So whatsoever happens in the body happens in the mind and vice versa, whatsoever happens in the mind happens in the body. If the body is nonmoving and you can attain a posture, if you can say to the body, “Keep quiet,” the mind will remain silent. Really, the mind starts moving and tries to move the body, because if the body moves then the mind can move. In a nonmoving body the mind cannot move; it needs a moving body.\nIf the body is nonmoving, the mind is nonmoving – you are centered. This nonmoving posture is not only a physiological training, it is to create a situation in which centering can happen, in which you can become disciplined. When you are, when you have become centered, when you know what it means to be, then you can learn because then you will be humble. Then you can surrender. Then no false ego will cling to you because once centered you know\nall egos are false. Then you can bow down. Then a disciple is born.\nTo become a disciple is a great achievement. Only through discipline will you become a disciple. Only through being centered will you become humble, will you become receptive, will you become empty and the guru, the master, can pour himself into you. In your emptiness, in your silence, he can come and reach to you. Communication becomes possible.\nDisciple means one who is centered, humble, receptive, open, ready, alert, waiting, prayerful. In Yoga the master is very, very important, absolutely important, because only when you are in the close proximity of a being who is centered will your own centering happen.\nThat is the meaning of satsang. You have heard the word satsang; it is used totally wrongly. Satsang means, in close proximity to the truth; it means, near the truth, it means near a master who has become one with the truth – just being near him, open, receptive and waiting. If your waiting has become deep, intense, a deep communion will happen.\nThe master is not going to do anything. He is simply there, available. If you are open he will flow within you. This flowing is called satsang. With a master you need not learn anything else. If you can learn satsang, that’s enough. If you can just be near him without asking, without thinking, without arguing; just present there, available, so the being of the master can flow in you, it is enough. And being can flow; it is already flowing. Whenever a person achieves integrity his being becomes a radiation. He is flowing. Whether you are there to receive or not is not the point. He flows like a river, and if you are empty like a vessel, ready, open, he will flow in you.\nA disciple is one who is ready to receive, who has become a womb; the master can penetrate into him. This is the meaning of the word satsang. It is not basically a discourse; satsang is not a discourse. There may be a discourse but the discourse is just an excuse. You are here and I will talk on Patanjali’s sutras, but that is just an excuse. If you are really here then the discourse, the talk, becomes just an excuse for your being here, for you to be here. And if you are really here, satsang starts. I can flow, and that flow is deeper than any talk, any communication through language, than any intellectual meeting with you.\nIf you are a disciple, if you are a disciplined being, if your mind is engaged in listening to me, then your being can be in satsang. Then your head is occupied. If your heart is open then on a deeper level a meeting happens. That meeting is satsang, and everything else is just an excuse to find ways to be close to the master.\nCloseness is all, but only a disciple can be close. Anybody and everybody cannot be close. Closeness means a loving trust. Why are we not close? –\nbecause there is fear. Too close may be dangerous, too open may be dangerous, because you become vulnerable and then it will be difficult for you to defend. So just as a security measure we keep everybody at a distance, we never allow anyone to enter a certain space.\nEverybody has a territory around him. Whenever somebody enters your territory you become afraid. Everybody has a space to protect. You are sitting alone in your room and a stranger enters into the room: just watch when you become really scared. There is a point that if he enters that point you will become scared, you will be afraid. A sudden trembling will be felt. He cannot move beyond a certain territory.\nTo be close means that now you have no territory of your own. To be close means to be vulnerable; to be close means that whatsoever happens, you are not thinking in terms of security.\nA disciple can be close for two reasons. One: he is centered or he is trying to be centered. A person who is even trying to be centered becomes unafraid; he becomes fearless. He has something which cannot be killed. You don’t have anything, hence the fear. You are a crowd. The crowd can disperse at any moment. You don’t have something like a rock which will be there whatsoever happens. You are existing without a rock, without a foundation; a house of cards, bound to be always in fear. Any wind, even any breeze can destroy you, so you have to protect yourself.\nBecause of this constant protection you cannot love, you cannot trust, you cannot be friendly. You may have many friends but there is no friendship, because friendship needs closeness. You may have wives and husbands and so- called lovers but there is no love because love needs closeness, love needs trust. You may have gurus, masters but there is no disciplehood, because you cannot allow yourself to be totally given to somebody’s being; nearness to his being, closeness to his being, so he can overpower you, flood over you.\nA disciple is a seeker who is not a crowd, who is trying to be centered and crystallized, who is at least trying, making efforts, sincere efforts to become individual, to feel his being, to become his own master. The whole discipline of Yoga is an effort to make you a master of yourself. As you are, you are just a slave of many, many desires. Many, many masters are there and you are just a slave pulled in many directions.\nNow the discipline of Yoga.\nYoga is discipline. It is an effort on your part to change yourself. Many other things have to be understood. Yoga is not a therapy. In the West many psychological therapies are now prevalent, and many Western psychologists\nthink that Yoga is also a therapy. It is not; it is a discipline. What is the difference? This is the difference: a therapy is needed if you are ill, a therapy is needed if you are diseased, a therapy is needed if you are pathological. A discipline is needed even when you are healthy. Really, only when you are healthy can a discipline help; it is not for pathological cases.\nYoga is for those who are completely healthy as far as medical science is concerned, normal. They are not schizophrenic, they are not mad, they are not neurotic. They are normal people, healthy people with no particular pathology. Still they become aware that whatsoever is called normality is futile, whatsoever is called health is of no use. Something more is needed, something greater is needed; something holier and whole is needed.\nTherapies are for ill people. Therapies can help you to come to Yoga, but Yoga is not a therapy. Yoga is for a higher order of health, a different order of health, a different type of being and wholeness. Therapy can, at the most, make you adjusted. Freud says we cannot do more. We can make you an adjusted, normal member of the society, but if the society itself is pathological, then what? And it is! The society itself is ill. A therapy can make you normal in the sense that you are adjusted to the society, but the society itself is ill.\nSo sometimes it happens that in an ill society a healthy person is thought to be ill. A Jesus is thought to be ill and every effort is done to make him adjusted. And when it is found that he is a hopeless case then he is crucified. When it is found that nothing can be done, that this man is incurable, then he is crucified. The society is itself ill because society is nothing but a collective. If all the members are ill the society is ill, and every member has to be adjusted to it.\nYoga is not therapy; Yoga is not trying in any way to make you adjusted to the society. If you want to define Yoga in terms of adjustment then it is not adjustment with the society, but it is adjustment with existence itself. It is adjustment with the divine.\nSo it may happen that a perfect yogi may appear mad to you. He may look out of his senses, out of his mind, because now he is in touch with the greater, with a higher mind, a higher order of things. He is in touch with the universal mind. It has always happened so: a Buddha, a Jesus, a Krishna always looks somehow eccentric. They don’t belong to us, they seem to be outsiders.\nThat’s why they call them avataras, outsiders. They have come as if from some other planet, they don’t belong to us. They may be higher, they may be good, they may be divine, but they don’t belong to us. They come from somewhere else. They are not part and parcel of our being, mankind. The feeling has persisted that they are outsiders. They are not; they are the real insiders because they have touched the innermost core of existence. But to us\nthey appear outsiders.\nNow the discipline of Yoga.\nIf your mind has come to realize that whatsoever you have been doing up to now was just senseless, it was a nightmare at the worst or a beautiful dream at the best, then the path of discipline opens before you. What is that path? The basic definition is:\nYoga is the cessation of mind – chittavrittinirodha.\nI told you that Patanjali is mathematical. In a single sentence: Now the discipline of Yoga, he is finished with you. This is the only sentence that has been used for you. Now he takes it for granted that you are interested in Yoga not as a hope but as a discipline, as a transformation right here and now. He proceeds to define:\nYoga is the cessation of mind.\nThis is the definition of Yoga, the best definition. Yoga has been defined in many ways; there are many definitions. Some say Yoga is the meeting of the mind with the divine; hence, it is called Yoga – Yoga means meeting, joining together. Some say that Yoga means dropping the ego, ego is the barrier: the moment you drop the ego you are joined to the divine. You were already joined; it only appeared that you were not joined because of the ego. There are many definitions, but Patanjali’s is the most scientific. He says: Yoga is the cessation of mind.\nYoga is the state of no-mind. The word mind covers everything – your egos, your desires, your hopes, your philosophies, your religions, your scriptures. Mind covers all. Whatsoever you can think is mind. All that is known, all that can be known, all that is knowable, is within mind. Cessation of the mind means cessation of the known, cessation of the knowable. It is a jump into the unknown. When there is no-mind you are in the unknown. Yoga is a jump into the unknown. It will not be right to say “unknown”; rather, “unknowable.”\nWhat is the mind? What is the mind doing there? What is it? Ordinarily we think that mind is something substantial there, inside the head. Patanjali doesn’t agree, and no one who has ever known the inside of the mind will agree. Modern science also doesn’t agree. Mind is not something substantial inside the head. Mind is just a function, just an activity.\nYou walk, and I say you are walking. What is walking? If you stop, where is walking? If you sit down, where has the walking gone? Walking is nothing\nsubstantial; it is an activity. So while you are sitting no one can ask, “Where have you put your walking? Just now you were walking, so where has the walking gone?” You will laugh. You will say, “Walking is not something substantial, it is just an activity. I can walk. I can again walk and I can stop. It is activity.”\nMind is also activity, but because of the word mind it appears as if something substantial is there. It is better to call it “minding” – just like walking. Mind means “minding,” mind means thinking. It is an activity.\nAgain and again I have been quoting Bodhidharma…\nBodhidharma went to China and the emperor of China came to see him. The emperor said, “My mind is very uneasy, very disturbed. You are a great sage and I have been waiting for you. Tell me what I should do to put my mind at peace.”\nBodhidharma said, “Don’t do anything. First, bring your mind to me.” The emperor could not follow. He said, “What do you mean?”\nHe said, “Come in the morning at four o’clock, when nobody is here. Come alone, and remember to bring your mind with you.”\nThe emperor couldn’t sleep the whole night. Many times he canceled the whole idea: “This man seems to be mad. What does he mean, ‘Come with your mind, don’t forget’?” But the man was so enchanting, so charismatic that the emperor couldn’t cancel the appointment. As if a magnet were pulling him, at four o’clock he jumped out of the bed and said, “Whatsoever happens, I must go. This man may have something; his eyes say that he has something. He looks a little crazy, but still I must go and see what can happen.”\nSo he arrived, and Bodhidharma was sitting with his big staff. And he said, “So you have come? Where is your mind? Have you brought it or not?”\nThe emperor said, “You talk nonsense. When I am here my mind is here, and it is not something which I can forget somewhere. It is in me.”\nSo Bodhidharma said, “Okay. So the first thing is decided – that the mind is within you.”\nThe emperor said, “Okay, the mind is within me.”\nBodhidharma said, “Now close your eyes and find out where it is. And if you can find out where it is, immediately indicate to me. I will put it at peace.”\nSo the emperor closed his eyes, tried and tried, looked and looked. The more he looked the more he became aware that there is no mind, that mind is an activity. It is not something there so you can pinpoint it. But the moment he realized that it is not something, then the absurdity of his quest became exposed to him: “If it is not something, nothing can be done about it. If it is an\nactivity, then don’t do the activity; that’s all. If it is like walking, don’t walk.”\nHe opened his eyes. He bowed down to Bodhidharma and said, “There is no mind to be found.”\nBodhidharma said, “Then I have put it at peace. And whenever you feel that you are uneasy, just look within for where that uneasiness is.”\nThe very looking is anti-mind, because a look is not a thinking. And if you look intensely your whole energy becomes a look, and the same energy becomes movement and thinking.\nYoga is the cessation of mind.\nThis is Patanjali’s definition: when there is no mind you are in Yoga, when there is mind you are not in Yoga. So you may do all the postures but if the mind goes on functioning, if you go on thinking, you are not in Yoga.\nYoga is the state of no-mind. If you can be without the mind without doing any posture, you have become a perfect yogi. It has happened to many without doing any postures, and it has not happened to many who have been doing postures for many lives. Because the basic thing to be understood is: when the activity of thinking is not there, you are there. When the activity of the mind is not there, when thoughts have disappeared – they are just like clouds – when they have disappeared your being, just like the sky, is uncovered. It is always there, only covered with the clouds, only covered with thoughts.\nYoga is the cessation of mind.\nNow in the West there is much appeal for Zen which is a Japanese method of Yoga. The word Zen comes from dhyana. Bodhidharma introduced this word dhyana into China. The word dhyana became jhan, and then in China ch’an, and then the word traveled to Japan and became Zen.\nThe root is dhyana. Dhyana means no-mind, so the whole training of Zen in Japan is nothing but how to stop “minding,” how to be a no-mind, how to be simply without thinking. Try it! When I say try it, it will look contradictory, but there is no other way to say it, because if you try, the very trying, the effort, is coming from the mind. You can sit in a posture and you can try some japa, chanting a mantra, or you can just try to sit silently, not to think. But then “not to think” becomes the thinking. Then you go on saying, “I am not to think, don’t think, stop thinking,” but this is all thinking.\nTry to understand. When Patanjali says no-mind …cessation of mind, he means complete cessation. He will not allow you to make a mantra, “Ram-\nRam-Ram.” He will say that this is not cessation, you are using the mind. He will say, “Simply stop!” But you will ask, “How? How can you simply stop?” The mind continues. Even if you sit the mind continues. Even if you don’t do, it goes on doing.\nPatanjali says, “Then just look. Let mind go, let mind do whatsoever it is doing. You just look. You don’t interfere. You just be a witness. You just be an onlooker, not concerned, as if the mind doesn’t belong to you, as if it is not your business, not your concern. Don’t be concerned. Just look and let the mind flow. It is flowing because of past momentum, because you have always helped it to flow. The activity has taken its own momentum, so it is flowing. Just don’t cooperate. Look, and let the mind flow.”\nFor many, many lives, perhaps a million lives, you have cooperated with it, you have helped it, you have given your energy to it. The river will flow for a while. If you don’t cooperate, if you just look, unconcerned – Buddha’s word is indifference, upeksha: looking without any concern, just looking, not doing anything in any way – the mind will flow for a while and it will stop by itself. When the momentum is lost, when the energy has flowed, the mind will stop. When the mind stops you are in Yoga: you have attained the discipline. This is the definition:\nYoga is the cessation of mind.\nThen the witness is established in itself.\nWhen the mind ceases …the witness is established in itself.\nWhen you can simply look without being identified with the mind, without judging, without appreciating, condemning, without choosing; you simply look and the mind flows, a time comes when by itself, of itself, the mind stops.\nWhen there is no-mind you are established in your witnessing. Then you have become a witness, just a seer, a drashta, a sakshi. Then you are not a doer, then you are not a thinker. Then you are simply being, pure being, purest of being. Then the witness is established in itself.\nIn the other states there is identification with the modifications of the mind.\nExcept witnessing, in all states you are identified with the mind. You become one with the flow of thoughts, you become one with the clouds: sometimes with the white cloud, sometimes with the black cloud, sometimes with a rain-filled cloud, sometimes with a vacant, empty cloud. But when you become one with the thought, you become one with the cloud, and you miss the purity of the sky, the purity of the space. You become clouded and this\nclouding happens because you get identified, you become one.\nA thought comes. You are hungry and the thought flashes in the mind. The thought is simply that there is hunger, the stomach is feeling hunger. Immediately you get identified; you say, “I am hungry.” The mind was just filled with a thought that hunger is there, and you have become identified and you say, “I am hungry.” This is identification.\nBuddha also feels hunger, Patanjali also feels hunger, but Patanjali will never say, “I am hungry”: he will say, “The body is hungry”; he will say, “My stomach is feeling hungry”; he will say, “There is hunger. I am a witness. I have come to witness this thought which has been flashed by the belly into the brain: ‘I am hungry.’” The belly is hungry, Patanjali will remain a witness. You become identified, you become one with the thought.\nThen the witness is established in itself. In the other states there is identification with the modifications of the mind.\nThis is the definition:\nYoga is the cessation of mind.\nWhen mind ceases you are established in your witnessing self. In other states except this there are identifications. And all identifications constitute the sansar; they are the world. If you are in the identifications you are in the world, in the misery. If you have transcended the identifications you are liberated. You have become a siddha, you are in nirvana. You have transcended this world of misery and entered the world of bliss.\nAnd that world is here and now – right now, this very moment! You need not wait for even a single moment. Just become a witness of the mind and you have entered. Get identified with the mind and you have missed. This is the basic definition.\nRemember everything, because later on, in other sutras, we will go into details about what is to be done, how it is to be done.\nBut always keep in mind that this is the foundation: one has to achieve a state of no-mind. That is the goal.\nEnough for today.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"8699","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_path_of_yoga/part4/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_path_of_yoga/>The Path of Yoga</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter 1: Introduction to the Path of Yoga</h1><div class=post-meta>41 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;8699 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Path_of_Yoga/part4.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part3>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

tomorrow. As man is, he cannot exist without self-deception.</p><p>Nietzsche says somewhere that man cannot live with the true: he needs
dreams, he needs illusions, he needs lies to exist. And Nietzsche is
right. As man is, he cannot exist with the truth. This has to be
understood very deeply, because without understanding this, there can be
no entry into the inquiry which is called Yoga.</p><p>The mind has to be understood deeply – the mind which needs lies, the
mind which needs illusions, the mind which cannot exist with the real,
the mind which needs dreams. You are not only dreaming in the night;
even while awake you are continuously dreaming. You may be looking at
me, you may be listening to me, but a dream current continuously goes on
within you. The mind is creating dreams, images, fantasies.</p><p>Now scientists say that a man can live without sleep but he cannot
live without dreams. In the old days it was understood that sleep was a
necessity, but now modern research says sleep is not really a necessity;
sleep is needed only so that you can dream. Dreaming is the necessity.
If you are allowed to sleep but not allowed to dream, you will not feel
fresh, alive, in the morning. You will feel tired, as if you have not
been able to sleep at all.</p><p>In the night there are periods for deep sleep and periods for
dreaming. There is a rhythm, just like day and night. There is a rhythm:
in the beginning you fall into deep sleep for nearabout forty,
forty-five minutes, then the dream phase comes in; then you dream; then
again dreamless sleep, then again dreaming. This goes on the whole
night. If your sleep is disturbed while you are deeply asleep without
dreaming, when you wake in the morning you will not feel that you have
missed anything. But if your dream is disturbed while you are dreaming,
in the morning you will feel completely tired, exhausted.</p><p>Now this can be observed from the outside. If someone is sleeping you
can judge whether he is dreaming or asleep. If he is dreaming his eyes
will be continuously moving, as if he is seeing something with closed
eyes. When he is fast asleep the eyes will not move; they will remain
steady. So if your sleep is disturbed while your eyes are moving, in the
morning you will feel tired. While your eyes are not moving sleep can be
disturbed; in the morning you will not feel anything is missing.</p><p>Many researchers have proved that the human mind feeds on dreams;
dreaming is a necessity, and dreaming is total auto-deception. And this
is so not</p><p>only in the night: while awake also the same pattern follows. Even in
the day you can notice that sometimes there will be dreams floating in
the mind, sometimes there will be no dreams.</p><p>When there are dreams you will be doing something but you will be
absent. Inside you are occupied. For example, you are here. If your mind
is passing through a dream-state you will listen to me without listening
at all, because your mind will be occupied within. You can only listen
to me if you are not in a dreaming state.</p><p>Day and night, mind goes on moving from no-dream to dream, then from
dream to no-dream again. This is an inner rhythm. Not only do we
continuously dream, in life also we project hopes into the future.</p><p>The present is almost always a hell: you can endure this hell only
because of the hope that you have projected into the future. You can
live today because of tomorrow. You are hoping something is going to
happen tomorrow – the doors of paradise will open tomorrow. They never
open today, and when tomorrow comes it will not come as tomorrow, it
will come as today, but by that time your mind has moved again. You go
on moving ahead of yourself: this is what dreaming means. You are not
one with the real, that which is nearby, that which is here and now, you
are somewhere else, moving ahead, jumping ahead.</p><p>You have named that tomorrow, that future, in many ways. Some people
call it heaven, some people call it <em>moksha</em>, but it is always in
the future. Somebody is thinking in terms of wealth, but that wealth is
going to be in the future. And somebody is thinking in terms of
paradise, and that paradise is going to be after you are dead, far away
in the future. You waste your present for that which is not: this is
what dreaming means. You cannot be here and now. To be just in the
moment seems to be arduous.</p><p>You can be in the past, because again that is dreaming – memories,
remembrance of things which are no more – or you can be in the future,
which is projection, which again is creating something out of the past.
The future is nothing but the past projected again. It may be more
colorful, more beautiful, more pleasant, but it is the past refined.</p><p>You cannot think anything other than the past: the future is nothing
but the past projected again. Future and past are not; the present is,
but you are never in the present. This is what dreaming means. Nietzsche
is right when he says that man cannot live with the truth. He needs
lies, he lives through lies. Nietzsche says that we go on saying that we
want the truth, but no one wants it. Our so-called truths are nothing
but lies, beautiful lies. No one is ready to see the naked reality.</p><p>This mind cannot enter on the path of Yoga because Yoga is a
methodology</p><p>to reveal the truth. Yoga is a method to come to a non-dreaming mind.
Yoga is the science to be in the here and now. Yoga means that now you
are ready not to move into the future. Yoga means now you are ready not
to hope, not to jump ahead of your being. Yoga means to encounter the
reality as it is.</p><p>One can enter Yoga, or the path of Yoga, only when he is totally
frustrated with his own mind as it is. If you are still hoping that you
can gain something through your mind, Yoga is not for you. A total
frustration is needed – the revelation that the mind which projects is
futile, the mind that hopes is nonsense, it leads nowhere. It simply
closes your eyes, it intoxicates you, it never allows reality to be
revealed to you. It protects you against reality.</p><p>Your mind is a drug. It is against that which is. So you can enter on
the path only if you are totally frustrated with your mind, with your
way of being, with the way you have existed up to now, and you can drop
it unconditionally.</p><p>Many become interested but very few enter, because that interest may
be just because of the mind. You may be hoping that now, through Yoga,
you may gain something. The achieving motive is there with the hope that
you may become perfect through Yoga, you may reach to the blissful state
of perfect being, that you may become one with the <em>brahman</em> that
you may achieve the <em>satchitananda</em>. This may be why you are
interested in Yoga. If this is the cause then there can be no meeting
between you and the path which is Yoga. Then you are totally against it,
moving in a totally opposite dimension.</p><p>Yoga means: “Now no hope, now no future, now no desires. But I am
ready to know what is. I am not interested in what can be, what should
be, what ought to be. I am not interested! I am interested only in that
which is.” Because only the real can free you, only the reality can
become liberation.</p><p>Total despair is needed. That despair Buddha called <em>dukkha</em>.
If you are really in misery don’t hope, because your hope will only
prolong the misery. Your hope is a drug. It can help you to continue,
but where are you moving? It will help you to reach only death and
nowhere else. All your hopes can lead you only to death; they
<em>are</em> leading.</p><p>Become totally hopeless – no future, no hope. It is difficult; it
needs courage to face the real. But such a moment comes to everyone,
sometime or other. A moment comes to every human being when he feels
total hopelessness. Absolute meaninglessness happens to him. When he
becomes aware that whatsoever he is doing is useless, wheresoever he is
going is going to nowhere, and all life is meaningless, then hopes drop.
Future drops, and for the first time he is in tune with the present, for
the first time he is face to face with reality.</p><p>Unless this moment comes to you, you can go on doing <em>asanas,</em>
postures, but that is not Yoga. Yoga is an inward turning, a total
about-turn. When you</p><p>are not moving into the future, not moving towards the past, then you
start moving within yourself, because your being is here and now, it is
not in the future. You are present here and now, you can enter this
reality. But then mind has to be <em>here</em>.</p><p>This moment is indicated by the first sutra of Patanjali. Before we
talk about the first sutra, a few other things have to be
understood.</p><p>Yoga is not a religion, remember that. Yoga is not Hindu, it is not
Mohammedan. Yoga is a pure science just like mathematics, physics or
chemistry. Physics is not Christian, physics is not Buddhist. Christians
may have discovered the laws of physics, but physics is not Christian.
It is just accidental that Christians have come to discover the laws of
physics. Physics remains just a science. Yoga is a science; it is just
accidental that Hindus discovered it. It is not Hindu. It is pure
mathematics of the inner being. A Mohammedan can be a yogi, a Christian
can be a yogi, a Jaina, a Buddhist can be a yogi.</p><p>Yoga is pure science. And Patanjali is the greatest name in the world
of Yoga. This man is rare; there is no other name comparable to
Patanjali. For the first time in the history of humanity this man
brought religion to the state of science. He made religion a science; a
religion of pure laws, no belief is needed.</p><p>So-called religions need beliefs. There is no other difference
between one religion and another except the difference of beliefs. A
Mohammedan has certain beliefs, a Hindu certain others, a Christian
certain others. The difference is of beliefs. Yoga has nothing as far as
belief is concerned; Yoga doesn’t say to believe in anything. Yoga says
to experience. Just as science says to experiment, Yoga says to
experience. Experiment and experience are both the same; their
directions are different. Experiment means there is something you can do
outside; experience means there is something you can do inside.
Experience is an inner experiment.</p><p>Science says, “Don’t believe, doubt as much as you can,” but also,
“Don’t disbelieve” – because disbelief is again a sort of belief. You
can believe in God, you can believe in the concept of no-God. You can
say that God exists with a fanatic attitude and you can say quite the
reverse, that God exists not, with the same fanaticism. Atheists,
theists, are all believers, and belief is not the realm of science.
Science means to experience something, that which is; no belief is
needed.</p><p>The second thing to remember is that Yoga is existential,
experiential, experimental; no belief is required, no faith is needed.
Only the courage to experience is needed, and that is what is lacking.
You can believe easily</p><p>because in belief you are not going to be transformed. Belief is
something added to you, something superficial. Your being is not
changed, you are not passing through some mutation. You may be a Hindu
one day and become a Christian the next day, simply by changing the Gita
for a Bible. You can change it for a Koran, but the man who was holding
the Gita and is now holding the Bible remains the same; he has just
changed his beliefs.</p><p>Beliefs are like clothes. Nothing substantial is transformed, you
remain the same. Dissect a Hindu, dissect a Mohammedan – inside they are
the same. The Hindu goes to a temple, the Mohammedan hates the temple.
The Mohammedan goes to the mosque and the Hindu hates the mosque but
inside they are the same human beings.</p><p>Belief is easy because you are not really required to do anything,
just a superficial dressing, a decoration, something which you can put
aside any moment you like. Yoga is not belief; that’s why it is
difficult, arduous, sometimes it seems impossible. It is an existential
approach. You will come to the truth not through belief but through your
own experience, through your own realization. That means you will have
to be totally changed – your viewpoints, your way of life, your mind;
your psyche as it is has to be shattered completely. Something new has
to be created. Only with that new will you come in contact with the
reality.</p><p>Yoga is both a death and a new life. As you are you will have to die,
and unless you die the new cannot be born. The new is hidden in you. You
are just a seed for it and the seed must fall down, be absorbed by the
earth. The seed must die, only then will the new arise out of you. Your
death will become your new life. Yoga is both a death and a new birth.
Unless you are ready to die you cannot be reborn. So it is not a
question of changing beliefs.</p><p>Yoga is not a philosophy. I say it is not a religion and I say it is
not a philosophy. It is not something you can think about. It is
something you will have to <em>be;</em> thinking won’t do. Thinking goes
on in your head. It is not really deep into the roots of your being, it
is not your totality, it is just a part, a functional part. It can be
trained and you can argue logically, you can think rationally, but your
heart will remain the same. Your heart is your deepest center, your head
is just a branch. You can be without the head but you cannot be without
the heart. Your head is not basic.</p><p>Yoga is concerned with your total being, with your roots. It is not
philosophical. So with Patanjali we will not be thinking, speculating.
With Patanjali we will be trying to know the ultimate laws of being, the
laws for its transformation, the laws of how to die and how to be reborn
again, the laws for a new order of being. That is why I call it a
science.</p><p>Patanjali is rare. He is an enlightened person like Buddha, like
Krishna, like Christ, like Mahavira, Mohammed, Zarathustra, but he is
different in one way. Buddha, Krishna, Mahavira, Zarathustra, Mohammed –
none of them has a scientific attitude. They are great founders of
religions. They have changed the whole pattern of the human mind and its
structure, but their approach is not scientific.</p><p>Patanjali is like an Einstein in the world of buddhas. He is a
phenomenon. He could easily have been a Nobel Prize winner like an
Einstein or Bohr or Max Planck or Heisenberg. He has the same attitude,
the same approach as a rigorous, scientific mind. He is not a poet;
Krishna is a poet. He is not a moralist; Mahavira is a moralist.
Patanjali is basically a scientist who is thinking in terms of laws. And
he has come to deduce absolute laws of the human being, the ultimate
working structure of the human mind and of reality.</p><p>If you follow Patanjali you will come to know that he is as exact as
any mathematical formula. Simply do what he says and the result will
happen. The result is bound to happen – it is just like two plus two
equals four or like heating water to one hundred degrees causes it to
evaporate. No belief is needed, you simply do it and know; it is
something to be done and known. That’s why I say there is no comparison:
never has another man like Patanjali existed on this earth.</p><p>You can find poetry in Buddha’s utterances; it is bound to be there.
Many times while Buddha is expressing himself he becomes poetic. The
realm of ecstasy, the realm of ultimate knowing is so beautiful, the
temptation is strong to become poetic, the beauty is such, the
benediction is such, the bliss is such that one starts talking in poetic
language.</p><p>But Patanjali resists that. It is very difficult to resist, no one
else has been able to. Jesus, Krishna, Buddha all became poetic. When
the splendor, the beauty, explode within you, you will start dancing,
you will start singing. In that state you are just like a lover who has
fallen in love with the whole universe.</p><p>Patanjali resists that. He will not use poetry; he will not even use
a single poetic symbol. He will not do anything with poetry. He will not
talk in terms of beauty: he will talk in terms of mathematics, he will
be exact. He will give you maxims, but those maxims are just indications
of what is to be done. He will not explode into ecstasy, he will not say
things that cannot be said, he will not try the impossible. He will just
put down the foundation and if you follow the foundation you will reach
the peak which is beyond. He is a rigorous mathematician, remember
this.</p><p>The first sutra:</p><p>Now the discipline of Yoga. Athayoganushasanam: Now the discipline of
Yoga.</p><p>Each single word has to be understood, because Patanjali will not use
a single superfluous word.</p><p>Now the discipline of Yoga. <span class=p>First try to understand
the word</span>now<span class=p>. This “now” is an indication to the
state of mind I was just talking to you about.</span></p><p>If you are disillusioned, if you are hopeless, if you have completely
become aware of the futility of all desires; if you see your life as
meaningless; whatsoever you have been doing up to now has simply fallen
dead, nothing remains in the future, you are in absolute despair – what
Kierkegaard calls anguish – you are in anguish, suffering, not knowing
what to do, not knowing where to go, not knowing to whom to turn, just
on the verge of madness or suicide or death, your whole pattern of life
has suddenly become futile; if this moment has come, Patanjali says:
<em>Now the discipline of Yoga</em> – only now can you understand the
science of Yoga, the discipline of Yoga.</p><p>If that moment has not come you can go on studying Yoga, and you can
become a great scholar but you will not be a yogi. You can write theses
on it, you can give discourses on it, but you will not be a yogi. The
moment has not come for you. Intellectually you can become interested,
through your mind you can be related to Yoga, but Yoga is nothing if it
is not a discipline. Yoga is not a <em>shastra</em>; it is not a
scripture. It is a discipline; it is something you have to do. It is not
curiosity, it is not philosophical speculation, it is deeper than that.
It is a question of life and death.</p><p>If the moment has come when you feel that all directions have become
confused, all roads have disappeared, the future is dark and every
desire has become bitter and through every desire you have known only
disappointment, all movement into hopes and dreams has ceased: <em>Now
the discipline of Yoga.</em></p><p>This “now” may not have come. Then I may go on talking about Yoga but
you will not listen. You can listen only if the moment is present in
you. Are you really dissatisfied? Everybody will say yes, but that
dissatisfaction is not real. You are dissatisfied with this, you may be
dissatisfied with that, but you are not totally dissatisfied. You are
still hoping. You are dissatisfied because of your past hopes but you
are still hoping for the future. Your dissatisfaction is not total: you
are still hankering for some satisfaction somewhere, for some
gratification somewhere.</p><p>Sometimes you feel hopeless but that hopelessness is not true. You
feel hopeless because certain hopes have not been achieved, certain
hopes have fallen away, but hoping is still there, hoping has not fallen
away. You will still</p><p>hope. You are dissatisfied with this hope, that hope, but you are not
dissatisfied with hope as such. If you are disappointed with hope as
such the moment has come, and then you can enter Yoga. And then this
entry will not be an entering into a mental, speculative phenomenon.
This entry will be an entry into a discipline.</p><p>What is discipline? Discipline means creating an order within you. As
you are, you are a chaos. As you are, you are totally disorderly.
Gurdjieff used to say – and Gurdjieff is in many ways like Patanjali, he
was again trying to make the core of religion a science – Gurdjieff said
that you are not one, you are a crowd; not even when you say “I” is
there any I. There are many I’s in you, many egos. In the morning one I,
in the afternoon another I, in the evening a third I, but you never
become aware of this mess – because who will become aware of it? There
is not a center that can become aware.</p><p>…the discipline of Yoga <span class=p>means Yoga wants to create a
crystallized center in you. As you are, you are a crowd and a crowd has
many phenomena. One is that you cannot believe a crowd. Gurdjieff used
to say that man cannot promise: who will promise? You are not there. If
you promise who will fulfill the promise? Next morning the one who
promised is not there.</span></p><p>People come to me and they say, “Now I will take the vow. I promise
to do this,” and I tell them, “Think twice before you promise something.
Are you confident that the next moment the one who promised it will be
there?” You decide that starting tomorrow you will get up early in the
morning at four o’clock, and at four o’clock somebody in you says,
“Don’t bother. It is so cold outside. And why are you in such a hurry?
We can do it tomorrow” – and you fall asleep again. When you get up you
repent and you think, “This is not good. I should have done it.” You
decide again, “Tomorrow I will do it”; and the same is going to happen
tomorrow because at four in the morning the one who promised is no
longer there, somebody else is in the chair. You are a Rotary Club: the
chairman goes on changing and every member becomes a Rotary chairman.
There is rotation: every moment someone else is the master.</p><p>Gurdjieff used to say, “This is the chief characteristic of man –
that he cannot promise.” You cannot fulfill a promise. You go on giving
promises, and you know well that you cannot fulfill them because you are
not one; you are a disorder, a chaos. Hence Patanjali says: <em>Now the
discipline of Yoga</em>. If your life has become an absolute misery, if
you have realized that whatsoever you do creates hell, then the moment
has come. This moment can change your dimension, your direction of
being.</p><p>Up until now you have lived as a chaos, a crowd. Yoga means now you
will have to be a harmony, you will have to become one. A
crystallization is needed,</p><p>a centering is needed. And unless you attain a center all that you do
is useless; it is wasting life and time. A center is the first
necessity, and only a person who has a center can be blissful. Everybody
asks for it, but you cannot ask for it, you have to earn it! Everybody
hankers for a blissful state of being, but only a center can be
blissful, a crowd cannot be blissful. A crowd has no self, there is no
atman. Who is going to be blissful?</p><p>Bliss means absolute silence, and silence is possible only when there
is harmony, when all the discordant fragments have become one, when
there is no crowd, only one. When you are alone in the house and nobody
else is there, you will be blissful. Right now everybody else is in your
house, you are not there. Only the guests are there, the host is always
absent, and only the host can be blissful.</p><p>This centering Patanjali calls discipline, <em>anushasanam.</em> The
word <em>discipline</em> is beautiful. It comes from the same root as
the word <em>disciple</em>. <em>Discipline</em> means the capacity to
learn, the capacity to know. But you cannot know, you cannot learn
unless you have attained the capacity to <em>be.</em></p><p><br></p><p>A man once went to Buddha and he said – he must have been a social
reformer, a revolutionary – he said to Buddha, “The world is in misery.
I agree with you.”</p><p>Buddha has never said that the world is in misery. Buddha says
<em>you</em> are the misery, not the world; <em>life</em> is misery, not
the world; <em>man</em> is misery, not the world; <em>mind</em> is
misery, not the world. But that revolutionary said, “The world is in
misery, I agree with you. Now tell me, what can I do? I have a deep
compassion and I want to serve humanity.”</p><p>Service must have been his motto! Buddha looked at him and remained
silent. Buddha’s disciple, Ananda, said, “This man seems to be sincere.
Guide him. Why are you silent?”</p><p>Then Buddha said to that revolutionary, “You want to serve the world,
but where are you? I don’t see anyone inside. I look in you, and there
is no one. You don’t have any center, and unless you are centered
whatsoever you do will create more mischief.”</p><p><br></p><p>All your social reformers, your revolutionaries, your leaders, are
the great mischief creators, mischief-mongers. The world would be better
if there were no leaders. But they cannot help: they must do something
because the world is in misery and they are not centered, so whatsoever
they do will create more misery. Compassion alone will not help, service
alone will not help. Compassion through a centered being is something
totally different.</p><p>Compassion through a crowd is mischief; that compassion is
poison.</p><p>Now the discipline of Yoga.</p><p>Discipline <span class=p>means the capacity to be, the capacity to
know, the capacity to learn. We must understand these three
things.</span></p><p>The capacity to be… All the Yoga postures are not really concerned
with the body, they are concerned with the capacity to be. Patanjali
says if you can sit silently without moving your body for a few hours,
you are growing in the capacity to be. Why do you move? You cannot sit
without moving even for a few seconds: your body starts moving,
somewhere you feel itching, the legs go dead, many things start
happening – these are just excuses for you to move.</p><p>You are not a master. You cannot say to the body, “Now I will not
move for one hour.” The body will revolt immediately! Immediately it
will force you to move, to do something. And it will give reasons: “You
have to move because an insect is biting.” You may not find the insect
when you look. You are not a being, you are a trembling, a continuous
hectic activity. Patanjali’s <em>asanas</em>, postures, are not really
concerned with any kind of physiological training but with an inner
training of being: just to be, without doing anything, without any
movement, without any activity. Just remain – that remaining will help
centering.</p><p>If you can remain in one posture the body will become a slave; it
will follow you. And the more the body follows you the more you will
have a greater being within you, a stronger being within you. Remember,
if the body is not moving your mind cannot move, because mind and body
are not two things, they are two poles of one phenomenon. You are not
body and mind, you are bodymind. Your personality is psychosomatic,
bodymind, both. Mind is the most subtle part of the body, or you can say
the reverse, that body is the grossest part of the mind. So whatsoever
happens in the body happens in the mind and vice versa, whatsoever
happens in the mind happens in the body. If the body is nonmoving and
you can attain a posture, if you can say to the body, “Keep quiet,” the
mind will remain silent. Really, the mind starts moving and tries to
move the body, because if the body moves then the mind can move. In a
nonmoving body the mind cannot move; it needs a moving body.</p><p>If the body is nonmoving, the mind is nonmoving – you are centered.
This nonmoving posture is not only a physiological training, it is to
create a situation in which centering can happen, in which you can
become disciplined. When you are, when you have become centered, when
you know what it means to be, then you can learn because then you will
be humble. Then you can surrender. Then no false ego will cling to you
because once centered you know</p><p>all egos are false. Then you can bow down. Then a disciple is
born.</p><p>To become a disciple is a great achievement. Only through discipline
will you become a disciple. Only through being centered will you become
humble, will you become receptive, will you become empty and the guru,
the master, can pour himself into you. In your emptiness, in your
silence, he can come and reach to you. Communication becomes
possible.</p><p>Disciple <span class=p>means one who is centered, humble,
receptive, open, ready, alert, waiting, prayerful. In Yoga the master is
very, very important, absolutely important, because only when you are in
the close proximity of a being who is centered will your own centering
happen.</span></p><p>That is the meaning of <em>satsang.</em> You have heard the word
<em>satsang</em>; it is used totally wrongly. <em>Satsang</em> means, in
close proximity to the truth; it means, near the truth, it means near a
master who has become one with the truth – just being near him, open,
receptive and waiting. If your waiting has become deep, intense, a deep
communion will happen.</p><p>The master is not going to do anything. He is simply there,
available. If you are open he will flow within you. This flowing is
called <em>satsang</em>. With a master you need not learn anything else.
If you can learn <em>satsang</em>, that’s enough. If you can just be
near him without asking, without thinking, without arguing; just present
there, available, so the being of the master can flow in you, it is
enough. And being can flow; it is already flowing. Whenever a person
achieves integrity his being becomes a radiation. He is flowing. Whether
you are there to receive or not is not the point. He flows like a river,
and if you are empty like a vessel, ready, open, he will flow in
you.</p><p>A disciple is one who is ready to receive, who has become a womb; the
master can penetrate into him. This is the meaning of the word
<em>satsang</em>. It is not basically a discourse; <em>satsang</em> is
not a discourse. There may be a discourse but the discourse is just an
excuse. You are here and I will talk on Patanjali’s sutras, but that is
just an excuse. If you are really here then the discourse, the talk,
becomes just an excuse for your being here, for you to be here. And if
you are <em>really</em> here, <em>satsang</em> starts. I can flow, and
that flow is deeper than any talk, any communication through language,
than any intellectual meeting with you.</p><p>If you are a disciple, if you are a disciplined being, if your mind
is engaged in listening to me, then your being can be in
<em>satsang</em>. Then your head is occupied. If your heart is open then
on a deeper level a meeting happens. That meeting is <em>satsang</em>,
and everything else is just an excuse to find ways to be close to the
master.</p><p>Closeness is all, but only a disciple can be close. Anybody and
everybody cannot be close. Closeness means a loving trust. Why are we
not close? –</p><p>because there is fear. Too close may be dangerous, too open may be
dangerous, because you become vulnerable and then it will be difficult
for you to defend. So just as a security measure we keep everybody at a
distance, we never allow anyone to enter a certain space.</p><p>Everybody has a territory around him. Whenever somebody enters your
territory you become afraid. Everybody has a space to protect. You are
sitting alone in your room and a stranger enters into the room: just
watch when you become really scared. There is a point that if he enters
that point you will become scared, you will be afraid. A sudden
trembling will be felt. He cannot move beyond a certain territory.</p><p>To be close means that now you have no territory of your own. To be
close means to be vulnerable; to be close means that whatsoever happens,
you are not thinking in terms of security.</p><p>A disciple can be close for two reasons. One: he is centered or he is
trying to be centered. A person who is even trying to be centered
becomes unafraid; he becomes fearless. He has something which cannot be
killed. You don’t have anything, hence the fear. You are a crowd. The
crowd can disperse at any moment. You don’t have something like a rock
which will be there whatsoever happens. You are existing without a rock,
without a foundation; a house of cards, bound to be always in fear. Any
wind, even any breeze can destroy you, so you have to protect
yourself.</p><p>Because of this constant protection you cannot love, you cannot
trust, you cannot be friendly. You may have many friends but there is no
friendship, because friendship needs closeness. You may have wives and
husbands and so- called lovers but there is no love because love needs
closeness, love needs trust. You may have gurus, masters but there is no
disciplehood, because you cannot allow yourself to be totally given to
somebody’s being; nearness to his being, closeness to his being, so he
can overpower you, flood over you.</p><p>A disciple is a seeker who is not a crowd, who is trying to be
centered and crystallized, who is at least trying, making efforts,
sincere efforts to become individual, to feel his being, to become his
own master. The whole discipline of Yoga is an effort to make you a
master of yourself. As you are, you are just a slave of many, many
desires. Many, many masters are there and you are just a slave pulled in
many directions.</p><p>Now the discipline of Yoga.</p><p>Yoga is discipline. It is an effort on your part to change yourself.
Many other things have to be understood. Yoga is not a therapy. In the
West many psychological therapies are now prevalent, and many Western
psychologists</p><p>think that Yoga is also a therapy. It is not; it is a discipline.
What is the difference? This is the difference: a therapy is needed if
you are ill, a therapy is needed if you are diseased, a therapy is
needed if you are pathological. A discipline is needed even when you are
healthy. Really, only when you are healthy can a discipline help; it is
not for pathological cases.</p><p>Yoga is for those who are completely healthy as far as medical
science is concerned, normal. They are not schizophrenic, they are not
mad, they are not neurotic. They are normal people, healthy people with
no particular pathology. Still they become aware that whatsoever is
called normality is futile, whatsoever is called health is of no use.
Something more is needed, something greater is needed; something holier
and whole is needed.</p><p>Therapies are for ill people. Therapies can help you to come to Yoga,
but Yoga is not a therapy. Yoga is for a higher order of health, a
different order of health, a different type of being and wholeness.
Therapy can, at the most, make you adjusted. Freud says we cannot do
more. We can make you an adjusted, normal member of the society, but if
the society itself is pathological, then what? And it is! The society
itself is ill. A therapy can make you normal in the sense that you are
adjusted to the society, but the society itself is ill.</p><p>So sometimes it happens that in an ill society a healthy person is
thought to be ill. A Jesus is thought to be ill and every effort is done
to make him adjusted. And when it is found that he is a hopeless case
then he is crucified. When it is found that nothing can be done, that
this man is incurable, then he is crucified. The society is itself ill
because society is nothing but a collective. If all the members are ill
the society is ill, and every member has to be adjusted to it.</p><p>Yoga is not therapy; Yoga is not trying in any way to make you
adjusted to the society. If you want to define Yoga in terms of
adjustment then it is not adjustment with the society, but it is
adjustment with existence itself. It is adjustment with the divine.</p><p>So it may happen that a perfect yogi may appear mad to you. He may
look out of his senses, out of his mind, because now he is in touch with
the greater, with a higher mind, a higher order of things. He is in
touch with the universal mind. It has always happened so: a Buddha, a
Jesus, a Krishna always looks somehow eccentric. They don’t belong to
us, they seem to be outsiders.</p><p>That’s why they call them <em>avataras,</em> outsiders. They have
come as if from some other planet, they don’t belong to us. They may be
higher, they may be good, they may be divine, but they don’t belong to
us. They come from somewhere else. They are not part and parcel of our
being, mankind. The feeling has persisted that they are outsiders. They
are not; they are the <em>real</em> insiders because they have touched
the innermost core of existence. But to us</p><p>they appear outsiders.</p><p>Now the discipline of Yoga.</p><p>If your mind has come to realize that whatsoever you have been doing
up to now was just senseless, it was a nightmare at the worst or a
beautiful dream at the best, then the path of discipline opens before
you. What is that path? The basic definition is:</p><p>Yoga is the cessation of mind – chittavrittinirodha.</p><p>I told you that Patanjali is mathematical. In a single sentence:
<em>Now the discipline of Yoga</em>, he is finished with <em>you.</em>
This is the only sentence that has been used for you. Now he takes it
for granted that you are interested in Yoga not as a hope but as a
discipline, as a transformation right here and now. He proceeds to
define:</p><p>Yoga is the cessation of mind.</p><p>This is the definition of Yoga, the best definition. Yoga has been
defined in many ways; there are many definitions. Some say Yoga is the
meeting of the mind with the divine; hence, it is called Yoga –
<em>Yoga</em> means meeting, joining together. Some say that Yoga means
dropping the ego, ego is the barrier: the moment you drop the ego you
are joined to the divine. You were already joined; it only appeared that
you were not joined because of the ego. There are many definitions, but
Patanjali’s is the most scientific. He says: <em>Yoga is the cessation
of mind</em>.</p><p>Yoga is the state of no-mind. The word <em>mind</em> covers
everything – your egos, your desires, your hopes, your philosophies,
your religions, your scriptures. <em>Mind</em> covers all. Whatsoever
you can think is mind. All that is known, all that can be known, all
that is knowable, is within mind. Cessation of the mind means cessation
of the known, cessation of the knowable. It is a jump into the unknown.
When there is no-mind you are in the unknown. Yoga is a jump into the
unknown. It will not be right to say “unknown”; rather,
“unknowable.”</p><p>What is the mind? What is the mind doing there? What is it?
Ordinarily we think that mind is something substantial there, inside the
head. Patanjali doesn’t agree, and no one who has ever known the inside
of the mind will agree. Modern science also doesn’t agree. Mind is not
something substantial inside the head. Mind is just a function, just an
activity.</p><p>You walk, and I say you are walking. What is walking? If you stop,
where is walking? If you sit down, where has the walking gone? Walking
is nothing</p><p>substantial; it is an activity. So while you are sitting no one can
ask, “Where have you put your walking? Just now you were walking, so
where has the walking gone?” You will laugh. You will say, “Walking is
not something substantial, it is just an activity. I can walk. I can
again walk and I can stop. It is activity.”</p><p>Mind is also activity, but because of the word <em>mind</em> it
appears as if something substantial is there. It is better to call it
“minding” – just like walking. Mind means “minding,” mind means
thinking. It is an activity.</p><p>Again and again I have been quoting Bodhidharma…</p><p><br></p><p>Bodhidharma went to China and the emperor of China came to see him.
The emperor said, “My mind is very uneasy, very disturbed. You are a
great sage and I have been waiting for you. Tell me what I should do to
put my mind at peace.”</p><p>Bodhidharma said, “Don’t do anything. First, bring your mind to me.”
The emperor could not follow. He said, “What do you mean?”</p><p>He said, “Come in the morning at four o’clock, when nobody is here.
Come alone, and remember to bring your mind with you.”</p><p>The emperor couldn’t sleep the whole night. Many times he canceled
the whole idea: “This man seems to be mad. What does he mean, ‘Come with
your mind, don’t forget’?” But the man was so enchanting, so charismatic
that the emperor couldn’t cancel the appointment. As if a magnet were
pulling him, at four o’clock he jumped out of the bed and said,
“Whatsoever happens, I must go. This man may have something; his eyes
say that he has something. He looks a little crazy, but still I must go
and see what can happen.”</p><p>So he arrived, and Bodhidharma was sitting with his big staff. And he
said, “So you have come? Where is your mind? Have you brought it or
not?”</p><p>The emperor said, “You talk nonsense. When I am here my mind is here,
and it is not something which I can forget somewhere. It is in me.”</p><p>So Bodhidharma said, “Okay. So the first thing is decided – that the
mind is within you.”</p><p>The emperor said, “Okay, the mind is within me.”</p><p>Bodhidharma said, “Now close your eyes and find out where it is. And
if you can find out where it is, immediately indicate to me. I will put
it at peace.”</p><p>So the emperor closed his eyes, tried and tried, looked and looked.
The more he looked the more he became aware that there is no mind, that
mind is an activity. It is not something there so you can pinpoint it.
But the moment he realized that it is not something, then the absurdity
of his quest became exposed to him: “If it is not something, nothing can
be done about it. If it is an</p><p>activity, then don’t do the activity; that’s all. If it is like
walking, don’t walk.”</p><p>He opened his eyes. He bowed down to Bodhidharma and said, “There is
no mind to be found.”</p><p>Bodhidharma said, “Then I have put it at peace. And whenever you feel
that you are uneasy, just look within for where that uneasiness is.”</p><p><br></p><p>The very looking is anti-mind, because a look is not a thinking. And
if you look intensely your whole energy becomes a look, and the same
energy becomes movement and thinking.</p><p>Yoga is the cessation of mind.</p><p>This is Patanjali’s definition: when there is no mind you are in
Yoga, when there is mind you are not in Yoga. So you may do all the
postures but if the mind goes on functioning, if you go on thinking, you
are not in Yoga.</p><p>Yoga is the state of no-mind. If you can be without the mind without
doing any posture, you have become a perfect yogi. It has happened to
many without doing any postures, and it has not happened to many who
have been doing postures for many lives. Because the basic thing to be
understood is: when the activity of thinking is not there, <em>you</em>
are there. When the activity of the mind is not there, when thoughts
have disappeared – they are just like clouds – when they have
disappeared your being, just like the sky, is uncovered. It is always
there, only covered with the clouds, only covered with thoughts.</p><p>Yoga is the cessation of mind.</p><p>Now in the West there is much appeal for Zen which is a Japanese
method of Yoga. The word <em>Zen</em> comes from <em>dhyana.</em>
Bodhidharma introduced this word <em>dhyana</em> into China. The word
<em>dhyana</em> became <em>jhan,</em> and then in China <em>ch’an</em>,
and then the word traveled to Japan and became <em>Zen</em>.</p><p>The root is <em>dhyana</em>. <em>Dhyana</em> means no-mind, so the
whole training of Zen in Japan is nothing but how to stop “minding,” how
to be a no-mind, how to be simply without thinking. Try it! When I say
try it, it will look contradictory, but there is no other way to say it,
because if you try, the very trying, the effort, is coming from the
mind. You can sit in a posture and you can try some <em>japa</em>,
chanting a mantra, or you can just try to sit silently, not to think.
But then “not to think” becomes the thinking. Then you go on saying, “I
am not to think, don’t think, stop thinking,” but this is all
thinking.</p><p>Try to understand. When Patanjali says no-mind …<em>cessation of
mind,</em> he means complete cessation. He will not allow you to make a
mantra, “Ram-</p><p>Ram-Ram.” He will say that this is not cessation, you are using the
mind. He will say, “Simply stop!” But you will ask, “How? How can you
simply stop?” The mind continues. Even if you sit the mind continues.
Even if you don’t do, it goes on doing.</p><p>Patanjali says, “Then just look. Let mind go, let mind do whatsoever
it is doing. You just look. You don’t interfere. You just be a witness.
You just be an onlooker, not concerned, as if the mind doesn’t belong to
you, as if it is not your business, not your concern. Don’t be
concerned. Just look and let the mind flow. It is flowing because of
past momentum, because you have always helped it to flow. The activity
has taken its own momentum, so it is flowing. Just don’t cooperate.
Look, and let the mind flow.”</p><p>For many, many lives, perhaps a million lives, you have cooperated
with it, you have helped it, you have given your energy to it. The river
will flow for a while. If you don’t cooperate, if you just look,
unconcerned – Buddha’s word is <em>indifference</em>, <em>upeksha:</em>
looking without any concern, just looking, not doing anything in any way
– the mind will flow for a while and it will stop by itself. When the
momentum is lost, when the energy has flowed, the mind will stop. When
the mind stops you are in Yoga: you have attained the discipline. This
is the definition:</p><p>Yoga is the cessation of mind.</p><p>Then the witness is established in itself.</p><p>When the mind ceases <em>…the witness is established in
itself</em>.</p><p>When you can simply look without being identified with the mind,
without judging, without appreciating, condemning, without choosing; you
simply look and the mind flows, a time comes when by itself, of itself,
the mind stops.</p><p>When there is no-mind you are established in your witnessing. Then
you have become a witness, just a seer, a <em>drashta,</em> a
<em>sakshi.</em> Then you are not a doer, then you are not a thinker.
Then you are simply being, pure being, purest of being. <em>Then the
witness is established in itself.</em></p><p>In the other states there is identification with the modifications of
the mind.</p><p>Except witnessing, in all states you are identified with the mind.
You become one with the flow of thoughts, you become one with the
clouds: sometimes with the white cloud, sometimes with the black cloud,
sometimes with a rain-filled cloud, sometimes with a vacant, empty
cloud. But when you become one with the thought, you become one with the
cloud, and you miss the purity of the sky, the purity of the space. You
become clouded and this</p><p>clouding happens because you get identified, you become one.</p><p>A thought comes. You are hungry and the thought flashes in the mind.
The thought is simply that there is hunger, the stomach is feeling
hunger. Immediately you get identified; you say, “<em>I</em> am hungry.”
The mind was just filled with a thought that hunger is there, and you
have become identified and you say, “<em>I</em> am hungry.” This is
identification.</p><p>Buddha also feels hunger, Patanjali also feels hunger, but Patanjali
will never say, “I am hungry”: he will say, “The body is hungry”; he
will say, “My stomach is feeling hungry”; he will say, “There is hunger.
I am a witness. I have come to witness this thought which has been
flashed by the belly into the brain: ‘I am hungry.’” The belly is
hungry, Patanjali will remain a witness. You become identified, you
become one with the thought.</p><p>Then the witness is established in itself. In the other states there
is identification with the modifications of the mind.</p><p>This is the definition:</p><p>Yoga is the cessation of mind.</p><p>When mind ceases you are established in your witnessing self. In
other states except this there are identifications. And all
identifications constitute the <em>sansar</em>; they are the world. If
you are in the identifications you are in the world, in the misery. If
you have transcended the identifications you are liberated. You have
become a <em>siddha,</em> you are in nirvana. You have transcended this
world of misery and entered the world of bliss.</p><p>And that world is here and now – right now, this very moment! You
need not wait for even a single moment. Just become a witness of the
mind and you have entered. Get identified with the mind and you have
missed. This is the basic definition.</p><p>Remember everything, because later on, in other sutras, we will go
into details about what is to be done, how it is to be done.</p><p>But always keep in mind that this is the foundation: one has to
achieve a state of no-mind. That is the goal.</p><p>Enough for today.</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part3>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

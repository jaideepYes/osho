‌Chapter 4: Madness or Meditation The first question:
Osho,
You said that there are only two alternatives for man, either madness or meditation. But millions of people on the earth have not reached to either of the two. Do you think they will?
They have reached. They have not reached to meditation, but they have reached to madness. And the difference between the mad who are inside the madhouses and the mad who are outside the madhouses is only of degrees."><meta name=author content="Osho"><link rel=canonical href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_path_of_yoga/part7/><meta name=google-site-verification content="XYZabc"><meta name=yandex-verification content="XYZabc"><meta name=msvalidate.01 content="XYZabc"><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.b609c58d5c11bb90b1a54e04005d74ad1ddf22165eb79f5533967e57df9c3b50.css integrity="sha256-tgnFjVwRu5CxpU4EAF10rR3fIhZet59VM5Z+V9+cO1A=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=mask-icon href=https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_path_of_yoga/part7/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:title" content="Chapter 4: Madness or Meditation"><meta property="og:description" content="< Previous | Contents | Next >

But millions of people on the earth have not reached to either of the two. Do you think they will?\nThey have reached. They have not reached to meditation, but they have reached to madness. And the difference between the mad who are inside the madhouses and the mad who are outside the madhouses is only of degrees. There is no qualitative difference; the difference is only of quantity. You may be less mad, they may be more mad, but man as he is, is mad.\nWhy do I say man as he is, is mad? Madness means many things. One: you are not centered. If you are not centered you will be insane, with many voices in you. Not centered, you are many, you are a multitude. And no one is a master in the house, and every servant of the house claims to be the master. There is confusion, conflict and a continuous struggle. You are in a continuous civil war. If this civil war were not going on then you would be in meditation. But it continues day and night, for twenty-four hours. Write down whatsoever goes on in your mind for a few minutes, and be honest. Write down exactly whatsoever goes on and you yourself will feel that this is mad.\nI have a particular technique I use with many people. I say to them, sit in a closed room and then start saying loudly whatsoever comes into the mind. Talk aloud so that you can listen. After fifteen minutes of this talking, you will feel that you are listening to a madman. Absurd, inconsistent, unrelated fragments float in the mind, your mind! So you may be ninety-nine percent mad and someone else has crossed the boundary, he has gone beyond one hundred percent. Those who have gone beyond one hundred percent are put in the madhouses. We cannot put you in the madhouse because there are not enough madhouses. And there cannot be, or the whole earth would have to be a madhouse.\nKhalil Gibran writes a small anecdote:\nHe says, one of his friends became mad so he was put in a madhouse. Then just out of love, compassion, Gibran went to see him, to visit him. He was sitting under a tree in the garden of the madhouse, surrounded by a very big wall. Khalil Gibran went there, sat by the side with his friend on the bench and\nasked him, “Do you ever think about why you are here?”\nThe madman laughed and he said, “I am here because I wanted to leave that big madhouse outside. And I am at peace here. In this madhouse – you call it a madhouse – no one is mad.”\nMad people cannot think that they are mad; that is one of the basic characteristics of madness. If you are mad you cannot think that you are mad. If you can think you are mad there is a possibility that you may not be. If you can think and conceive that you are mad you are still a little sane. The madness has not occurred in its totality. So this is the paradox: those who are really sane know that they are mad, and those who are completely mad cannot think that they are mad.\nYou never think that you are mad: that is part of madness. You are not centered; you cannot be sane. Your sanity is just superficial, arranged. Just on the surface you appear to be sane. That’s why you have to continuously deceive the world around you. You have to hide much, you have to prevent much. You don’t allow everything to come out. You are suppressive: you may be thinking something but you will say something else. You are pretending, and because of this pretension you can have the minimum superficial sanity around you; inside you are boiling.\nSometimes there are eruptions. In anger you erupt and the madness that you have been hiding comes out. It breaks all your adjustments. So psychologists say anger is a temporary madness. You will again regain balance, you will again hide your reality, you will again polish your surface – you will again become sane. And you will say that, “It was wrong. I did it in spite of myself. I never meant it, so forgive me.” But you meant it! That was more real! This asking for forgiveness is just a pretension. Again you are maintaining your surface, your mask.\nA sane man has no mask. His face is original: whatsoever he is, he is. A madman has to continuously change his faces. Every moment he has to use a different mask for a different situation, for different relationships. Just watch yourself changing your faces: when you come to your wife you have one face, when you go to your beloved, your mistress, you have a totally different face. When you talk to your servant you have a different mask and when you talk to your master, a totally different face. It may be that your servant is standing on your right and your boss is standing on your left – then you have two faces simultaneously. On the left you have one face, on the right you have a different face. Because to the servant you cannot show the same face; you need not – you are the boss there, so one side of the face will be “the boss.” You cannot\nshow that “boss face” to your boss, you are a servant there; your other side will show a servile attitude.\nThis is constantly going on. You are not watching, that’s why you are not aware. If you watch you will become aware that you are mad. You don’t have any face; the original face has been lost. To regain the original face is what meditation means.\nSo Zen masters say, “Go and find your original face, the face you had before you were born, the face you will have when you have died.” Between birth and death you have false faces, you continuously go on deceiving. Not only others: you also deceive yourself; when you stand before a mirror you deceive yourself, you never see your real face in the mirror. You don’t have enough courage to face yourself. That face in the mirror is also false. You create it, you enjoy it; it is a painted mask.\nWe are not only deceiving others, we are also deceiving ourselves. Really, we cannot deceive others if we have not already deceived ourselves. So we have to believe in our own lies, only then can we make others believe. If you don’t believe in your lies nobody else is going to be deceived.\nThis whole nuisance that you call your life leads nowhere. It is a mad affair. You work too much, you overwork; you walk and run. You struggle your whole life and you reach nowhere. You don’t know from where you are coming, you don’t know where you are moving to, where you are going. If you meet a man on the road and you ask him, “Where are you coming from, sir?” and he says, “I don’t know,” and you ask him, “Where are you going,” and he says, “I don’t know,” and still he says, “Don’t prevent me, I am in a hurry,” what will you think about him? You will think he is mad.\nIf you don’t know where you are coming from and where you are going, then what is the hurry? But this is the situation of everybody, and everybody is on the road. Life is a road – you are always in the middle – and you don’t know where you have come from, you don’t know where you are going. You have no knowledge of the source, no knowledge of the goal, but you are in a great hurry, making every effort to reach nowhere.\nWhat type of sanity is this? And out of this whole struggle not even glimpses of happiness come to you, not even glimpses. You simply hope someday, somewhere, tomorrow, the day after tomorrow – or after death, in some afterlife – that happiness is waiting for you. This is just a trick to postpone, so that you don’t feel too miserable right now.\nYou don’t even have glimpses of bliss. What type of sanity is this? You are in continuous misery, and moreover, misery that is not created by anybody else. You create your suffering. What type of sanity is this? You create your\nsuffering continuously. I call it madness.\nSanity will be this: you will become aware that you are not centered. So the first thing to be done is to get centered – to have a center within yourself from where you can lead your life, from where you can discipline your life; to have a master within you from where you can direct, you can move. The first thing is to be crystallized, and then the second thing will be not to create suffering for yourself. Drop all that creates suffering, all those motives, desires, hopes which create suffering.\nBut you are not aware. You simply go on doing it, you don’t see that you create it. Whatsoever you do, you are sowing some seeds. Then trees will follow, and whatsoever you have sown you will reap. And whenever you reap anything there is suffering, but you never see that these seeds were sown by you. Whenever suffering happens to you, you think it is coming from somewhere else. You think it is some accident or that some evil forces are working against you. So you have invented the Devil.\nThe Devil is just a scapegoat. You are the Devil; you create your suffering. But whenever you suffer you simply throw it on the Devil: “The Devil is doing something.” Then you are at ease. Then you never become aware of your own foolish pattern of life, stupid pattern of life.\nOr you call it fate, or you say, “God is testing me.” But you go on avoiding the basic fact that you are the sole cause of whatsoever happens to you. And nothing is accidental. Everything has a causal link – and you are the cause.\nFor example, you fall in love. Love gives you a feeling that bliss is somewhere nearby. You feel for the first time that you are welcomed by someone, at least one person welcomes you. You start flowering. Even one person welcoming you, waiting for you, loving you, caring for you, you start flowering. But only in the beginning, immediately your wrong patterns start working, and you immediately want to possess the beloved, the loved one.\nAnd possession is killing. The moment you possess the lover you have killed. Then you suffer. Then you weep and cry and you think that the lover is wrong, fate is wrong, “Destiny is not in my favor.” But you don’t know that you have poisoned love through possession, through possessiveness.\nBut every lover is doing that, and every lover suffers. Love, which can give you the deepest blessings, becomes the deepest misery; therefore old cultures, particularly in India in the old days, completely destroyed the phenomenon of love. They had arranged marriages for children – no possibility of falling in love, because love leads to misery. This was such a known phenomenon that if you allow love, then love leads to misery, so it is better not to have the possibility. Let the children, small children, be married. Before they can fall in\nlove let them be married. Then they will never know what love is and they will not be in misery.\nBut love never creates misery – it is you who poisons it. Love is always joy, love is always celebration. Love is the deepest ecstasy that nature allows you, but you destroy it. So just not to fall into misery, in India and in other old, ancient countries, the possibility of love was completely closed. So then you will not fall in misery, but then you have also missed the only ecstasy that nature allows. So a mediocre life will be there with no misery, no happiness, just dragging on somehow. This is what marriage has been in the past.\nNow America is trying, the West is trying to revive love. But much misery is coming through that, and sooner or later Western countries will have to decide for child marriage again. A few psychologists have already proposed that child marriage has to be brought back because love is creating so much misery. But I say again that it is not love. Love cannot create misery. It is you, your pattern of madness which creates misery – and not only in love, everywhere. Everywhere you are bound to bring your mind.\nFor example, many people come to me, and they start meditating. In the beginning there are sudden flashes, but only in the beginning. Once they have known certain experiences, once they have known certain glimpses, everything stops. And they come to me weeping and crying and saying, “What is happening? Something was going to happen, something was happening, now everything has stopped. And we are trying our best, but nothing, nothing comes out of it.”\nI tell them, “It happened for the first time because you were not expecting. Now you are expecting so the whole situation has changed. When you had that feeling of weightlessness for the first time, a feeling of being filled by something unknown, a feeling of being carried from your dead life, a feeling of ecstatic moments, you were not expecting it. You had never known such moments. For the first time they were falling on you. You were unaware, unexpecting. That was the situation.\n“Now you are remembering that situation, and every day you sit for meditation with expectation. Now you are cunning, clever, calculating. When for the first time you had the glimpse you were innocent, like a child. You were playing with meditation and there was no expectation. Then it happened. It will happen again but only when you have again become innocent. Now your mind is bringing misery. And if you go on insisting that you must have the experience again and again, you will lose it forever. You must forget it completely. It may take years, unless you become again completely inattentive that somewhere in the past such a happening was there. Then the possibility\nwill again be open to you.”\nThis I call madness. You destroy everything, whatsoever comes in your hands, you immediately destroy it. And remember life gives you many gifts, unasked. You have never asked life. Life gives you many gifts, but you destroy every gift. And every gift can become greater and greater; it can grow because life never gives you anything dead. If love has been given to you it can grow. It can grow to unknown dimensions. But the very first moment you destroy. If meditation has happened to you just feel thankful to the divine and forget it. Just feel grateful and remember well that you don’t have any capacity to have it; you are not in any way authorized to have it.\nIt has been a gift. It has been an overflowing of the divine. Forget it. Don’t expect it, don’t demand it. It will come some day again – deeper, higher, greater. It will go on expanding, but every day drop it from the mind.\nThere is no end to its possibilities. It will become infinite; the whole cosmos will become ecstatic for you. But your mind has to be dropped. Your mind is the madness. So when I say there are only two alternatives, madness and meditation, I mean mind and meditation. If you remain confined in the mind you will remain mad. Unless you transcend the mind you cannot transcend madness. At the most you can be a functioning member of the society, that’s all. And you can be a functioning member of the society because the whole society is just like you. Everybody is mad, so madness is the rule.\nBecome aware – and don’t think that others are mad; feel it deeply that you are mad and something has to be done. Immediately! It is an emergency! Don’t postpone it because there may come a moment when you cannot do anything. You may go so mad that you cannot do anything.\nRight now you can do something. You are still within limits. Something can be done, some efforts can be made; the pattern can be changed. But a moment can come when you cannot do anything, when you have become completely shattered and you have lost even the consciousness.\nIf you can feel that you are mad this is a very hopeful sign. It shows you can become alert towards your own reality. The door is there, you can become really sane. At least this much sanity is there – that you can understand.\nThe second question:\nOsho,\nCapacity of right-knowledge is one of the five faculties of the mind, but it is not a state of no-mind. Then how is it possible that whatsoever one sees through this center is true? Does this center of right-knowledge function after enlightenment, or can even a meditator, a sadhak, be with this center?\nYes, the center of right-knowledge, praman, is still within the mind. Ignorance is of the mind, knowledge is also of the mind. When you go beyond mind there is neither; there is neither ignorance nor knowledge. Knowledge is also a disease. It is a good disease, a golden one, but it is a disease. So really, it cannot be said that Buddha knows, it cannot be said that he doesn’t know. He has gone beyond. Whether he knows or is ignorant, nothing can be asserted about it.\nWhen there is no mind, how can you know or not know? Knowing is through mind, not knowing is also through mind. Through mind you can know wrongly, through mind you can know rightly. When there is no mind, knowledge and ignorance both cease. This will be difficult to understand, but it is easy if you follow: mind knows, so mind can be ignorant; when there is no mind how can you be ignorant and how can you be knowing? You are, but knowing and not knowing have both ceased.\nMind has two centers: one, of right-knowledge. If that center functions it starts functioning through concentration, meditation, contemplation, prayerfulness – then whatsoever you know is true. There is a wrong center: it functions if you are sleepy, live in a hypnotic-like state, intoxicated with something or other – sex, music, drugs or anything.\nYou can be addicted to food, then it becomes an intoxicant. You may be eating too much. You are mad, obsessed, with food. Then food becomes like alcohol. Anything that takes possession of your mind, anything without which you cannot live becomes intoxicating. So if you live through intoxicants then your center of wrong-knowledge functions and whatsoever you know is false, untrue. You live in a world of lies.\nBut both these centers belong to the mind. When mind drops and meditation has come to its totality… In Sanskrit we have two terms: one term is dhyana – dhyana means meditation; and the other term is samadhi. Samadhi means perfect meditation, where even meditation has become unnecessary, where even to do meditation is meaningless. You cannot do it, you have become it – then it is samadhi.\nIn this state of samadhi there is no mind; there is neither knowledge nor ignorance, there is only pure being. This pure being is a totally different dimension. It is not a dimension of knowing, it is a dimension of being.\nEven if such a man as a Buddha or a Jesus wants to communicate to you, he will have to use mind. For communication he will have to use mind. And if you ask a certain question he will have to use his center of mind for right- knowledge. Mind is the instrument of communication, of thinking, of knowing. But when you are not asking anything and Buddha is sitting under his bo\ntree, he is neither ignorant nor a knower. He is there. Really, there is no difference between the tree and the Buddha. There is a difference, but in a way there is no difference. He has become just as if a tree; he just exists. There is no movement, even of knowledge. The sun will rise but he will not know that the sun has risen. Not that he will remain ignorant – no, simply that is now not his movement. He has become so silent, so still, that nothing moves. He is just like the tree. The tree is totally ignorant. Or, you can say the tree is just below the mind; the mind has not started functioning. The tree will become man in some life, the tree will become mad like you in some life, and the tree will try for meditation in some life, and the tree will also one day become a buddha. The tree is below mind, and Buddha sitting under the tree is beyond mind. They are both mindless. One is still to attain the mind and one has attained and crossed over it.\nSo when mind is transcended, when no-mind is achieved, you are a pure being, satchitananda. There is no happening in you. Neither is there action nor is there knowing – but it is difficult for us…\nScriptures say that all duality is transcended. Knowledge is also part of duality – ignorance, knowledge. But so-called saints go on saying that Buddha had become “a knower.” Then we are clinging to the duality. That’s why Buddha never answered when many times, millions of times it had been asked of him, “What happens when a person becomes a buddha?” He remained silent. He said, “Become and know.” Nothing can be said about what happens because whatsoever can be said will be said in your language. And your language is basically dualistic so whatsoever can be said will be untrue.\nIf it is said that he knows it will be untrue, if it is said that he has become immortal it will be untrue, if it is said that now he has achieved bliss it will be untrue – because all duality disappears. Misery disappears, happiness disappears. Ignorance disappears, knowledge disappears. Darkness disappears, light disappears. Death disappears, life disappears. Nothing can be said. Or, only this much can be said – that whatsoever you can think will not be there, whatsoever you can conceive of will not be there. And the only way is, to become that. Only then do you know.\nThe third question:\nOsho,\nYou said that if we see visions of Rama or that we are dancing with Krishna, to remember it is only imagination. But the other night you said that if we were receptive we could communicate with Christ, Buddha or Krishna right now. Is that communication also imagination when it happens, or are there meditative states in which Christ or Buddha are really there?\nThis is a little difficult to understand. The first thing: out of one hundred cases, ninety-nine cases will be of imagination. You imagine, which is why to a Christian Krishna never appears in visions; to a Hindu Mohammed never appears in visions. Leave Mohammed and Jesus; they are far away. But to a Jaina Rama never appears in his visions – cannot appear. To a Hindu Mahavira never appears. Why? – you don’t have any imagination for Mahavira.\nIf you are born a Hindu you have been fed with the concept of Rama and Krishna. If you are born a Christian you have been fed – your computer, your mind, has been fed – with the image of Jesus. Whenever you start meditating that fed-in image comes up in the mind; it flashes in the mind.\nJesus appears to you, Jesus never appears to Jews. And he was a Jew. He was born a Jew, he died a Jew, but he never appears to Jews because they never believed in him. They thought he was just a vagabond, they crucified him as a criminal. Jesus never appears to Jews; he belonged to Jews, he had Jewish blood and bones.\nI have heard…\nIn Nazi Germany soldiers of Hitler were killing Jews in a town. They had killed many. A few Jews escaped. It was a Sunday morning. They escaped; they went into a church because they thought that would be the best hiding place, the Christian church. The church was filled with Christians, it was a Sunday morning. So a few, a dozen Jews were hiding there.\nBut the soldiers got the news that some Jews had gone into the church and they were hiding there. So they went into the church; they told the priest, “Stop your service!” The leader of the soldiers went to the rostrum and said, “You cannot deceive us. There are a few Jews hiding here. So anyone who is a Jew should go out and stand in a line. If you follow our orders you can save yourself. If someone tries to deceive, he will be killed immediately.”\nSo by and by, the Jews came out of the church and they stood in a line. Then suddenly the whole crowd in the church became aware that Jesus had disappeared, the statue of Jesus. He was also a Jew so he was standing outside in the line!\nBut Jesus never appears to Jews. He was not a Christian, he never belonged to any Christian church. If he comes back he will not recognize a Christian church, he will go to the synagogue; he will go to the Jewish community. He will go to see the rabbi; he cannot go to see a Catholic or Protestant priest. He doesn’t know. But he never appears to Jews because he has never been a seed\nin their imagination. They refused him, so the seed is not there.\nSo whatsoever happens, ninety-nine possibilities are that it may be just fed- in knowledge, concepts, images: they flash before your mind. And when you start meditating you become sensitive. You become so sensitive that you can become a victim of your own imagination. And the imagination will look so real, and there is no way to judge whether it is real or unreal.\nIn one percent of cases it will not be imaginary, but how can you know? In that one percent of cases there will be no image, really. You will not feel Jesus standing before you crucified, you will not feel Krishna standing before you and dancing with you. You will feel the presence but there will be no image, remember this. You will feel a descendance of divine presence. You will be filled with something unknown, but without any form. There will be no dancing Krishna and there will be no crucified Jesus and there will be no Buddha sitting in siddhasan, no! There will simply be a presence, a vital presence that is flowing within you, in and out. You are overwhelmed, you are in the ocean of it.\nJesus will not be within you, you will be in Jesus; that will be the difference. Krishna will not be in your mind, an image; you will be in Krishna. But then Krishna will be formless. It will be an experience but not an image.\nThen why call it Krishna? There will be no form. Why call it Jesus? These are simply symbols, linguistic symbols. You are acquainted with the word Jesus so when that presence fills you and you become part of it, a vibrating part of it, when you become a drop in that ocean, how can you express it? You know the most beautiful word for you may be Jesus or the most beautiful word may be Buddha or Krishna – these words are fed into the mind so you have to choose these certain words to indicate toward that presence.\nBut that presence is not an image, it is not a dream. It is not a vision at all. You can use Jesus, you can use Krishna, you can use Christ, or whatsoever name has appeal for you, whatsoever name has a love-appeal for you, that’s up to you. That word and that name and that image will come from your mind, but the experience itself is imageless. It is not an imagination.\nA Catholic priest was visiting a Zen master, Nan-in. Nan-in had never heard about Jesus, so this Catholic priest thought, “It will be good. I should go and read some parts from The Sermon on the Mount, and I will see how Nan-in reacts. And people say that he is enlightened.”\nSo that Catholic priest went to Nan-in and he said, “Master, I am a Christian, and I have got a book and I love it. I would like to read something from it just to know how you respond, how you react.” So he read a few lines from The\nSermon on the Mount, The New Testament. He translated it into Japanese because Nan-in could understand only Japanese.\nWhen he started translating, the whole face of Nan-in changed completely. Tears started flowing from his eyes and he said, “These are the words of Buddha.”\nThe Christian priest said, “No, no, these are the words of Jesus.”\nBut Nan-in said, “Whatsoever name you give, I feel these are the words of the Buddha, because I know only Buddha and these words can come only through Buddha. And if you say they have come through Jesus, then Jesus was a buddha; that doesn’t make any difference. Then I will tell my disciples that Jesus was a buddha.”\nThis will be the feeling. If you feel the presence of the divine, then names are just immaterial. Names are bound to be different for everyone because names come from education, names come from culture, names come from the race you belong to. But that experience doesn’t belong to any society, that experience doesn’t belong to any culture, that experience doesn’t belong to your mind, the computer – it belongs to you.\nSo remember, if you see visions, they are imagination. If you start feeling presences, formless, existential experiences – enveloped in them, merged in them, melting in them – then you are really in contact.\nYou can call that presence Jesus, you can call that presence Buddha, it depends on you; it makes no difference. Jesus is a buddha and Buddha is a christ. Those who have gone beyond the mind have also gone beyond personalities. They have also gone beyond forms. If Jesus and Buddha are standing together, there will be two bodies but one soul. There will be two bodies but not two presences, only one presence.\nIt is just as if you put two lamps in a room. There are two lamps, just their bodies, but the light has become one. You cannot demarcate that this light belongs to this lamp and that light belongs to that lamp. The lights have merged. Only the material part of the lamp has remained separate, but the non- material part has become one.\nIf Buddha and Jesus come close, if they stand together, you will see two lamps, separate, but their lights have already merged. They have become one. All those who have known truth have become one. Their names are different for their followers; for them, now there are no names.\nThe fourth question:\nOsho,\nPlease explain whether awareness is also one of the modifications of the mind.\nNo, awareness is not part of the mind. It flows through the mind, but it is not part of the mind. It is just like this bulb: the electricity flows through it, but the electricity is not part of the bulb. If you break the bulb you have not broken the electricity. The expression will be hindered, but the potentiality remains hidden. You put in another bulb and the electricity starts flowing.\nMind is just an instrument. Awareness is not part of it, but awareness flows through it. When mind is transcended, awareness remains in itself. That’s why I say even Buddha will have to use the mind if he talks to you, if he relates to you, because then he will need flow, flow of his inner pool. He will have to use instruments, mediums, and then mind will function. But mind is just a vehicle.\nYou move in a vehicle, but you are not the vehicle. You go in a car or you fly in an aircraft, but you are not the vehicle. Mind is just the vehicle. And you are not using the mind to its total capacity. If you use it to its total capacity, it will become right-knowledge.\nWe are using our mind like someone using an airplane as a bus. You can cut the wings off the airplane and use it like a bus on the road. That will do, it will work like a bus – but you are foolish. That bus can fly! You are not using it to its right capacity.\nYou are using your mind for dreams, imaginations, madness. You have not used it rightly, you have cut the wings off. If you use it with the wings it can become right-knowledge, it can become wisdom. But that too is part of the mind, that too is the vehicle. The user remains behind; the user cannot be the used. You are using it, you are awareness. And all the effort for meditation is meant to know this awareness in its purity, without any medium, without any instrument. You can know it only when mind has stopped functioning. When mind has stopped functioning you will become aware that awareness is there, you are filled with it. Mind was just a vehicle, a passage. Now if you want you can use the mind, if you don’t want you need not use it.\nBody and mind are both vehicles. You are not the vehicle, you are the master hidden behind these vehicles. But you have forgotten completely. And you have become the cart, you have become the vehicle. This is what Gurdjieff calls identification. This is what in India yogis have called tadatmya, becoming one with something which you are not.\nThe fifth question:\nOsho,\nPlease explain how it is possible that just by looking, by witnessing the recordings in the brain cells, the sources of thought-process can cease to be.\nThey never cease to be, but by witnessing identification is broken. Buddha lived in his body for forty years after his enlightenment, the body did not cease. Continuously, for forty years he was talking, explaining, making people understand what had happened to him and how the same can happen to them. He was using the mind, the mind had not ceased. And when he came back to his home town after twelve years he recognized his father, he recognized his wife, he recognized his son. The mind was there, the memory was there; otherwise recognition would have been impossible. The mind had not really ceased.\nWhen we say the mind ceases, we mean your identification is broken. Now you know this is the mind and this is “I am.” The bridge is broken. Now the mind is not the master. It has become just an instrument, it has fallen to its right place. So whenever you need it you can use it. It is just like this fan: if we want to use it we put it on, then the fan starts functioning. Right now we are not using the fan so it is non-functioning. But it is there, it has not ceased to be, any moment we can use it. It has not disappeared.\nBy witnessing identification disappears, not the mind. But by identification disappearing, you are a totally new being. For the first time you have come to know your real phenomenon, your real reality. For the first time you have come to know who you are. Now mind is just part of the mechanism around you.\nIt is just as if you are a pilot and flying an airplane: you use many instruments, your eyes are working on many instruments continuously aware of this and that, but you are not the instruments.\nThis mind, this body and many functions of the body-mind, are just around you – the mechanism. In this mechanism you can exist in two ways. One way of existence is forgetting yourself and feeling as if you are the mechanism. This is bondage, this is misery; this is the world, the sansar.\nAnother way of functioning is to become alert that you are separate, you are different. Then you go on using, but now it makes a lot of difference – now the mechanism is not you. And if something goes wrong in the mechanism you can try to put it right, but you will not be disturbed. Even if the whole mechanism disappears you will not be disturbed.\nBuddha dying and you dying are two different phenomena. Buddha knows only the mechanism is dying. It has been used and now there is no need of it. A burden has been removed, he is becoming free. Now he will move without form. But you dying is totally different: you are suffering, you are crying\nbecause you feel you are dying, not the mechanism. It is your death; then it becomes an intense suffering.\nJust by witnessing, mind doesn’t cease and the brain cells will not cease. Rather, they will become more alive because there will be less conflict, more energy. They will become fresher, and you can use them more rightly, more accurately, but you will not be burdened by them and they will not force you to do something. They will not push and pull you here and there. You will be the master.\nBut how does it happen just by witnessing? – because the bondage has happened by not witnessing. The bondage has happened because you are not alert, so the bondage will disappear if you become alert. The bondage is only unawareness. Nothing else is needed but becoming more alert, whatsoever you do.\nYou are sitting here listening to me. You can listen with awareness, you can listen without awareness. Without awareness listening will also be there, but it will be a different thing, the quality will differ. Then your ears are listening and your mind is functioning somewhere else.\nThen, somehow, a few words will penetrate you and they will be mixed, and your mind will interpret them in its own way. It will put its own ideas into them. Everything will be a muddle and a mess. You have listened but many things will be bypassed, you will not listen to many things, you will choose. Then the whole thing will be distorted.\nIf you are alert, the moment you become alert thinking ceases. With alertness you cannot think. The whole energy becomes alert, there is no energy left to move into thinking. When you are alert even for a single moment, you simply listen. There is no barrier. Your own words are not there to get mixed in. You need not interpret. The impact is direct.\nIf you can listen with alertness, then what I am saying may be meaningful or may not be meaningful, but your listening with alertness will always be significant in meaning. That very alertness will make a peak of your consciousness. The past will dissolve, the future will disappear. You will be nowhere else, you will be just here and now.\nIn that moment of silence when thinking is not, you will be deep in contact with your own source. And that source is bliss, and that source is divine. So the only thing to be done is to do everything with alertness.\nThe last question:\nOsho,\nWhile talking on Lao Tzu you become a Taoist sage, while talking on Tantra you become a tantrika, while talking on bhakti you become an enlightened bhakta, and while talking on Yoga you have become a perfect yogi. Will you please explain how this phenomenon has become possible?\nIf you are not, only then can it become possible. If you are, then it cannot become possible. If you are not, if the host has completely disappeared, then the guest becomes the host. So the guest may be Lao Tzu, the guest may be Patanjali. The host is not there, so the guest takes the place completely, he becomes the host. If you are not, then you can become Patanjali; there is no difficulty. You can become Krishna, you can become Christ. If you are there, then it is very difficult. And if you are there, whatsoever you say will be wrong. That’s why I say these are not commentaries. I am not commenting on\nPatanjali. I am simply absent, allowing Patanjali. So it is not a commentary. “Commentary” means, “Patanjali is something separate, and I am something\nseparate, and I am commenting on Patanjali” – it is bound to be distorted because how can you comment on Patanjali? Whatsoever I say would be my saying, and whatsoever I say would be my interpretation. It cannot be of Patanjali himself. And that’s not good. That is destructive. So I am not commenting at all. I am simply allowing, and this allowing is possible if you are not.\nIf you become a witness, the ego disappears. And when the ego disappears you become a vehicle, you become a passage, you become a flute. And the flute can be put on Patanjali’s lips, and the flute can be put on Krishna’s lips, and the flute can be put on Buddha’s lips – the flute remains the same. But when it is on Buddha’s lips, Buddha is flowing.\nSo this is not a commentary. This is difficult to understand because you cannot allow. You are so much inside you cannot allow anyone. And these are not persons. Patanjali is not a person: Patanjali is a presence. If you are absent, his presence can function.\nIf you ask Patanjali, he will say the same. If you ask Patanjali, he will not say that these sutras have been created by him. He will say, “These are very ancient – sanatan.” He will say, “Millions and millions of seers have seen them. I am just a vehicle. I am absent and they are speaking.” If you ask Krishna, he will say, “I am not speaking. This is the ancientmost message. It has been always so.” And if you ask Jesus, he will say, “I am no more, I am not there.”\nWhy this insistence? Anybody who becomes absent, who becomes a non- ego, starts functioning as a vehicle, as a passage for all that is true, a passage for all that is hidden in existence, that can flow. And you will be able to\nunderstand whatsoever I am saying only when even for a few moments you will be absent.\nIf you are too much there, your ego is there and then whatsoever I am saying cannot flow in you. It is not only an intellectual communication. It is something deeper.\nIf you are a non-ego even for a single moment, then the impact will be felt. Then something unknown has entered into you, and in that moment you will understand. And there is no other way to understand.\nEnough for today.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"7325","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_path_of_yoga/part7/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_path_of_yoga/>The Path of Yoga</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter 4: Madness or Meditation</h1><div class=post-meta>35 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;7325 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Path_of_Yoga/part7.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part6>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

4: Madness or Meditation</h1><p><br></p><p>The first question:</p><p>Osho,</p><p>You said that there are only two alternatives for man, either madness
or meditation. But millions of people on the earth have not reached to
either of the two. Do you think they will?</p><p>They <em>have</em> reached. They have not reached to meditation, but
they have reached to madness. And the difference between the mad who are
inside the madhouses and the mad who are outside the madhouses is only
of degrees. There is no qualitative difference; the difference is only
of quantity. You may be less mad, they may be more mad, but man as he
is, is mad.</p><p>Why do I say man as he is, is mad? Madness means many things. One:
you are not centered. If you are not centered you will be insane, with
many voices in you. Not centered, you are many, you are a multitude. And
no one is a master in the house, and every servant of the house claims
to be the master. There is confusion, conflict and a continuous
struggle. You are in a continuous civil war. If this civil war were not
going on then you would be in meditation. But it continues day and
night, for twenty-four hours. Write down whatsoever goes on in your mind
for a few minutes, and be honest. Write down exactly whatsoever goes on
and you yourself will feel that this is mad.</p><p>I have a particular technique I use with many people. I say to them,
sit in a closed room and then start saying loudly whatsoever comes into
the mind. Talk aloud so that you can listen. After fifteen minutes of
this talking, you will feel that you are listening to a madman. Absurd,
inconsistent, unrelated fragments float in the mind, <em>your</em> mind!
So you may be ninety-nine percent mad and someone else has crossed the
boundary, he has gone beyond one hundred percent. Those who have gone
beyond one hundred percent are put in the madhouses. We cannot put you
in the madhouse because there are not enough madhouses. And there cannot
be, or the whole earth would have to be a madhouse.</p><p>Khalil Gibran writes a small anecdote:</p><p><br></p><p>He says, one of his friends became mad so he was put in a madhouse.
Then just out of love, compassion, Gibran went to see him, to visit him.
He was sitting under a tree in the garden of the madhouse, surrounded by
a very big wall. Khalil Gibran went there, sat by the side with his
friend on the bench and</p><p>asked him, “Do you ever think about why you are here?”</p><p>The madman laughed and he said, “I am here because I wanted to leave
that big madhouse outside. And I am at peace here. In this madhouse –
you call it a madhouse – no one is mad.”</p><p><br></p><p>Mad people cannot think that they are mad; that is one of the basic
characteristics of madness. If you are mad you cannot think that you are
mad. If you can think you are mad there is a possibility that you may
not be. If you can think and conceive that you are mad you are still a
little sane. The madness has not occurred in its totality. So this is
the paradox: those who are really sane know that they are mad, and those
who are completely mad cannot think that they are mad.</p><p>You never think that you are mad: that is part of madness. You are
not centered; you cannot be sane. Your sanity is just superficial,
arranged. Just on the surface you appear to be sane. That’s why you have
to continuously deceive the world around you. You have to hide much, you
have to prevent much. You don’t allow everything to come out. You are
suppressive: you may be thinking something but you will say something
else. You are pretending, and because of this pretension you can have
the minimum superficial sanity around you; inside you are boiling.</p><p>Sometimes there are eruptions. In anger you erupt and the madness
that you have been hiding comes out. It breaks all your adjustments. So
psychologists say anger is a temporary madness. You will again regain
balance, you will again hide your reality, you will again polish your
surface – you will again become sane. And you will say that, “It was
wrong. I did it in spite of myself. I never meant it, so forgive me.”
But you meant it! That was more real! This asking for forgiveness is
just a pretension. Again you are maintaining your surface, your
mask.</p><p>A sane man has no mask. His face is original: whatsoever he is, he
is. A madman has to continuously change his faces. Every moment he has
to use a different mask for a different situation, for different
relationships. Just watch yourself changing your faces: when you come to
your wife you have one face, when you go to your beloved, your mistress,
you have a totally different face. When you talk to your servant you
have a different mask and when you talk to your master, a totally
different face. It may be that your servant is standing on your right
and your boss is standing on your left – then you have two faces
simultaneously. On the left you have one face, on the right you have a
different face. Because to the servant you cannot show the same face;
you need not – you are the boss there, so one side of the face will be
“the boss.” You cannot</p><p>show that “boss face” to your boss, you are a servant there; your
other side will show a servile attitude.</p><p>This is constantly going on. You are not watching, that’s why you are
not aware. If you watch you will become aware that you are mad. You
don’t have any face; the original face has been lost. To regain the
original face is what meditation means.</p><p>So Zen masters say, “Go and find your original face, the face you had
before you were born, the face you will have when you have died.”
Between birth and death you have false faces, you continuously go on
deceiving. Not only others: you also deceive yourself; when you stand
before a mirror you deceive yourself, you never see your real face in
the mirror. You don’t have enough courage to face yourself. That face in
the mirror is also false. You create it, you enjoy it; it is a painted
mask.</p><p>We are not only deceiving others, we are also deceiving ourselves.
Really, we cannot deceive others if we have not already deceived
ourselves. So we have to believe in our own lies, only then can we make
others believe. If you don’t believe in your lies nobody else is going
to be deceived.</p><p>This whole nuisance that you call your life leads nowhere. It is a
mad affair. You work too much, you overwork; you walk and run. You
struggle your whole life and you reach nowhere. You don’t know from
where you are coming, you don’t know where you are moving to, where you
are going. If you meet a man on the road and you ask him, “Where are you
coming from, sir?” and he says, “I don’t know,” and you ask him, “Where
are you going,” and he says, “I don’t know,” and still he says, “Don’t
prevent me, I am in a hurry,” what will you think about him? You will
think he is mad.</p><p>If you don’t know where you are coming from and where you are going,
then what is the hurry? But this is the situation of everybody, and
everybody is on the road. Life is a road – you are always in the middle
– and you don’t know where you have come from, you don’t know where you
are going. You have no knowledge of the source, no knowledge of the
goal, but you are in a great hurry, making every effort to reach
nowhere.</p><p>What type of sanity is this? And out of this whole struggle not even
glimpses of happiness come to you, not even glimpses. You simply hope
someday, somewhere, tomorrow, the day after tomorrow – or after death,
in some afterlife – that happiness is waiting for you. This is just a
trick to postpone, so that you don’t feel too miserable right now.</p><p>You don’t even have glimpses of bliss. What type of sanity is this?
You are in continuous misery, and moreover, misery that is not created
by anybody else. You create your suffering. What type of sanity is this?
You create your</p><p>suffering continuously. I call it madness.</p><p>Sanity will be this: you will become aware that you are not centered.
So the first thing to be done is to get centered – to have a center
within yourself from where you can lead your life, from where you can
discipline your life; to have a master within you from where you can
direct, you can move. The first thing is to be crystallized, and then
the second thing will be not to create suffering for yourself. Drop all
that creates suffering, all those motives, desires, hopes which create
suffering.</p><p>But you are not aware. You simply go on doing it, you don’t see that
you create it. Whatsoever you do, you are sowing some seeds. Then trees
will follow, and whatsoever you have sown you will reap. And whenever
you reap anything there is suffering, but you never see that these seeds
were sown by you. Whenever suffering happens to you, you think it is
coming from somewhere else. You think it is some accident or that some
evil forces are working against you. So you have invented the Devil.</p><p>The Devil is just a scapegoat. You are the Devil; you create your
suffering. But whenever you suffer you simply throw it on the Devil:
“The Devil is doing something.” Then you are at ease. Then you never
become aware of your own foolish pattern of life, stupid pattern of
life.</p><p>Or you call it fate, or you say, “God is testing me.” But you go on
avoiding the basic fact that you are the sole cause of whatsoever
happens to you. And nothing is accidental. Everything has a causal link
– and you are the cause.</p><p>For example, you fall in love. Love gives you a feeling that bliss is
somewhere nearby. You feel for the first time that you are welcomed by
someone, at least one person welcomes you. You start flowering. Even one
person welcoming you, waiting for you, loving you, caring for you, you
start flowering. But only in the beginning, immediately your wrong
patterns start working, and you immediately want to possess the beloved,
the loved one.</p><p>And possession is killing. The moment you possess the lover you have
killed. Then you suffer. Then you weep and cry and you think that the
lover is wrong, fate is wrong, “Destiny is not in my favor.” But you
don’t know that you have poisoned love through possession, through
possessiveness.</p><p>But every lover is doing that, and every lover suffers. Love, which
can give you the deepest blessings, becomes the deepest misery;
therefore old cultures, particularly in India in the old days,
completely destroyed the phenomenon of love. They had arranged marriages
for children – no possibility of falling in love, because love leads to
misery. This was such a known phenomenon that if you allow love, then
love leads to misery, so it is better not to have the possibility. Let
the children, small children, be married. Before they can fall in</p><p>love let them be married. Then they will never know what love is and
they will not be in misery.</p><p>But love never creates misery – it is you who poisons it. Love is
always joy, love is always celebration. Love is the deepest ecstasy that
nature allows you, but you destroy it. So just not to fall into misery,
in India and in other old, ancient countries, the possibility of love
was completely closed. So then you will not fall in misery, but then you
have also missed the only ecstasy that nature allows. So a mediocre life
will be there with no misery, no happiness, just dragging on somehow.
This is what marriage has been in the past.</p><p>Now America is trying, the West is trying to revive love. But much
misery is coming through that, and sooner or later Western countries
will have to decide for child marriage again. A few psychologists have
already proposed that child marriage has to be brought back because love
is creating so much misery. But I say again that it is not love. Love
cannot create misery. It is you, your pattern of madness which creates
misery – and not only in love, everywhere. Everywhere you are bound to
bring your mind.</p><p>For example, many people come to me, and they start meditating. In
the beginning there are sudden flashes, but only in the beginning. Once
they have known certain experiences, once they have known certain
glimpses, everything stops. And they come to me weeping and crying and
saying, “What is happening? Something was going to happen, something was
happening, now everything has stopped. And we are trying our best, but
nothing, nothing comes out of it.”</p><p>I tell them, “It happened for the first time because you were not
expecting. Now you are expecting so the whole situation has changed.
When you had that feeling of weightlessness for the first time, a
feeling of being filled by something unknown, a feeling of being carried
from your dead life, a feeling of ecstatic moments, you were not
expecting it. You had never known such moments. For the first time they
were falling on you. You were unaware, unexpecting. That was the
situation.</p><p>“Now you are remembering that situation, and every day you sit for
meditation with expectation. Now you are cunning, clever, calculating.
When for the first time you had the glimpse you were innocent, like a
child. You were playing with meditation and there was no expectation.
Then it happened. It will happen again but only when you have again
become innocent. Now your mind is bringing misery. And if you go on
insisting that you must have the experience again and again, you will
lose it forever. You must forget it completely. It may take years,
unless you become again completely inattentive that somewhere in the
past such a happening was there. Then the possibility</p><p>will again be open to you.”</p><p>This I call madness. You destroy everything, whatsoever comes in your
hands, you immediately destroy it. And remember life gives you many
gifts, unasked. You have never asked life. Life gives you many gifts,
but you destroy every gift. And every gift can become greater and
greater; it can grow because life never gives you anything dead. If love
has been given to you it can grow. It can grow to unknown dimensions.
But the very first moment you destroy. If meditation has happened to you
just feel thankful to the divine and forget it. Just feel grateful and
remember well that you don’t have any capacity to have it; you are not
in any way authorized to have it.</p><p>It has been a gift. It has been an overflowing of the divine. Forget
it. Don’t expect it, don’t demand it. It will come some day again –
deeper, higher, greater. It will go on expanding, but every day drop it
from the mind.</p><p>There is no end to its possibilities. It will become infinite; the
whole cosmos will become ecstatic for you. But your mind has to be
dropped. Your mind is the madness. So when I say there are only two
alternatives, madness and meditation, I mean mind and meditation. If you
remain confined in the mind you will remain mad. Unless you transcend
the mind you cannot transcend madness. At the most you can be a
functioning member of the society, that’s all. And you can be a
functioning member of the society because the whole society is just like
you. Everybody is mad, so madness is the rule.</p><p>Become aware – and don’t think that others are mad; feel it deeply
that you are mad and something has to be done. Immediately! It is an
emergency! Don’t postpone it because there may come a moment when you
cannot do anything. You may go so mad that you cannot do anything.</p><p>Right now you can do something. You are still within limits.
Something can be done, some efforts can be made; the pattern can be
changed. But a moment can come when you cannot do anything, when you
have become completely shattered and you have lost even the
consciousness.</p><p>If you can feel that you are mad this is a very hopeful sign. It
shows you can become alert towards your own reality. The door is there,
you can become really sane. At least this much sanity is there – that
you can understand.</p><p>The second question:</p><p>Osho,</p><p>Capacity of right-knowledge is one of the five faculties of the mind,
but it is not a state of no-mind. Then how is it possible that
whatsoever one sees through this center is true? Does this center of
right-knowledge function after enlightenment, or can even a meditator, a
sadhak, be with this center?</p><p>Yes, the center of right-knowledge, <em>praman,</em> is still within
the mind. Ignorance is of the mind, knowledge is also of the mind. When
you go beyond mind there is neither; there is neither ignorance nor
knowledge. Knowledge is also a disease. It is a good disease, a golden
one, but it is a disease. So really, it cannot be said that Buddha
knows, it cannot be said that he doesn’t know. He has gone beyond.
Whether he knows or is ignorant, nothing can be asserted about it.</p><p>When there is no mind, how can you know or not know? Knowing is
through mind, not knowing is also through mind. Through mind you can
know wrongly, through mind you can know rightly. When there is no mind,
knowledge and ignorance both cease. This will be difficult to
understand, but it is easy if you follow: mind knows, so mind can be
ignorant; when there is no mind how can you be ignorant and how can you
be knowing? You are, but knowing and not knowing have both ceased.</p><p>Mind has two centers: one, of right-knowledge. If that center
functions it starts functioning through concentration, meditation,
contemplation, prayerfulness – then whatsoever you know is true. There
is a wrong center: it functions if you are sleepy, live in a
hypnotic-like state, intoxicated with something or other – sex, music,
drugs or anything.</p><p>You can be addicted to food, then it becomes an intoxicant. You may
be eating too much. You are mad, obsessed, with food. Then food becomes
like alcohol. Anything that takes possession of your mind, anything
without which you cannot live becomes intoxicating. So if you live
through intoxicants then your center of wrong-knowledge functions and
whatsoever you know is false, untrue. You live in a world of lies.</p><p>But both these centers belong to the mind. When mind drops and
meditation has come to its totality… In Sanskrit we have two terms: one
term is <em>dhyana</em> – <em>dhyana</em> means meditation; and the
other term is <em>samadhi. Samadhi</em> means perfect meditation, where
even meditation has become unnecessary, where even to do meditation is
meaningless. You cannot do it, you have become it – then it is
<em>samadhi</em>.</p><p>In this state of <em>samadhi</em> there is no mind; there is neither
knowledge nor ignorance, there is only pure being. This pure being is a
totally different dimension. It is not a dimension of knowing, it is a
dimension of being.</p><p>Even if such a man as a Buddha or a Jesus wants to communicate to
you, he will have to use mind. For communication he will have to use
mind. And if you ask a certain question he will have to use his center
of mind for right- knowledge. Mind is the instrument of communication,
of thinking, of knowing. But when you are not asking anything and Buddha
is sitting under his <em>bo</em></p><p>tree, he is neither ignorant nor a knower. He is there. Really, there
is no difference between the tree and the Buddha. There is a difference,
but in a way there is no difference. He has become just as if a tree; he
just exists. There is no movement, even of knowledge. The sun will rise
but he will not <em>know</em> that the sun has risen. Not that he will
remain ignorant – no, simply that is now not his movement. He has become
so silent, so still, that nothing moves. He is just like the tree. The
tree is totally ignorant. Or, you can say the tree is just below the
mind; the mind has not started functioning. The tree will become man in
some life, the tree will become mad like you in some life, and the tree
will try for meditation in some life, and the tree will also one day
become a buddha. The tree is below mind, and Buddha sitting under the
tree is beyond mind. They are both mindless. One is still to attain the
mind and one has attained and crossed over it.</p><p>So when mind is transcended, when no-mind is achieved, you are a pure
being, <em>satchitananda.</em> There is no happening in you. Neither is
there action nor is there knowing – but it is difficult for us…</p><p>Scriptures say that all duality is transcended. Knowledge is also
part of duality – ignorance, knowledge. But so-called saints go on
saying that Buddha had become “a knower.” Then we are clinging to the
duality. That’s why Buddha never answered when many times, millions of
times it had been asked of him, “What happens when a person becomes a
buddha?” He remained silent. He said, “Become and know.” Nothing can be
said about what happens because whatsoever can be said will be said in
your language. And your language is basically dualistic so whatsoever
can be said will be untrue.</p><p>If it is said that he knows it will be untrue, if it is said that he
has become immortal it will be untrue, if it is said that now he has
achieved bliss it will be untrue – because all duality disappears.
Misery disappears, happiness disappears. Ignorance disappears, knowledge
disappears. Darkness disappears, light disappears. Death disappears,
life disappears. Nothing can be said. Or, only this much can be said –
that whatsoever you can think will not be there, whatsoever you can
conceive of will not be there. And the only way is, to become that. Only
then do you know.</p><p>The third question:</p><p>Osho,</p><p>You said that if we see visions of Rama or that we are dancing with
Krishna, to remember it is only imagination. But the other night you
said that if we were receptive we could communicate with Christ, Buddha
or Krishna right now. Is that communication also imagination when it
happens, or are there meditative states in which Christ or Buddha are
really there?</p><p>This is a little difficult to understand. The first thing: out of one
hundred cases, ninety-nine cases will be of imagination. You imagine,
which is why to a Christian Krishna never appears in visions; to a Hindu
Mohammed never appears in visions. Leave Mohammed and Jesus; they are
far away. But to a Jaina Rama never appears in his visions – cannot
appear. To a Hindu Mahavira never appears. Why? – you don’t have any
imagination for Mahavira.</p><p>If you are born a Hindu you have been fed with the concept of Rama
and Krishna. If you are born a Christian you have been fed – your
computer, your mind, has been fed – with the image of Jesus. Whenever
you start meditating that fed-in image comes up in the mind; it flashes
in the mind.</p><p>Jesus appears to you, Jesus never appears to Jews. And he was a Jew.
He was born a Jew, he died a Jew, but he never appears to Jews because
they never believed in him. They thought he was just a vagabond, they
crucified him as a criminal. Jesus never appears to Jews; he belonged to
Jews, he had Jewish blood and bones.</p><p>I have heard…</p><p><br></p><p>In Nazi Germany soldiers of Hitler were killing Jews in a town. They
had killed many. A few Jews escaped. It was a Sunday morning. They
escaped; they went into a church because they thought that would be the
best hiding place, the Christian church. The church was filled with
Christians, it was a Sunday morning. So a few, a dozen Jews were hiding
there.</p><p>But the soldiers got the news that some Jews had gone into the church
and they were hiding there. So they went into the church; they told the
priest, “Stop your service!” The leader of the soldiers went to the
rostrum and said, “You cannot deceive us. There are a few Jews hiding
here. So anyone who is a Jew should go out and stand in a line. If you
follow our orders you can save yourself. If someone tries to deceive, he
will be killed immediately.”</p><p>So by and by, the Jews came out of the church and they stood in a
line. Then suddenly the whole crowd in the church became aware that
Jesus had disappeared, the statue of Jesus. He was also a Jew so he was
standing outside in the line!</p><p><br></p><p>But Jesus never appears to Jews. He was not a Christian, he never
belonged to any Christian church. If he comes back he will not recognize
a Christian church, he will go to the synagogue; he will go to the
Jewish community. He will go to see the rabbi; he cannot go to see a
Catholic or Protestant priest. He doesn’t know. But he never appears to
Jews because he has never been a seed</p><p>in their imagination. They refused him, so the seed is not there.</p><p>So whatsoever happens, ninety-nine possibilities are that it may be
just fed- in knowledge, concepts, images: they flash before your mind.
And when you start meditating you become sensitive. You become so
sensitive that you can become a victim of your own imagination. And the
imagination will look so real, and there is no way to judge whether it
is real or unreal.</p><p>In one percent of cases it will not be imaginary, but how can you
know? In that one percent of cases there will be no image, really. You
will not feel Jesus standing before you crucified, you will not feel
Krishna standing before you and dancing with you. You will feel the
presence but there will be no image, remember this. You will feel a
descendance of divine presence. You will be filled with something
unknown, but without any form. There will be no dancing Krishna and
there will be no crucified Jesus and there will be no Buddha sitting in
<em>siddhasan,</em> no! There will simply be a presence, a vital
presence that is flowing within you, in and out. You are overwhelmed,
you are in the ocean of it.</p><p>Jesus will not be within you, you will be in Jesus; that will be the
difference. Krishna will not be in your mind, an image; you will be in
Krishna. But then Krishna will be formless. It will be an experience but
not an image.</p><p>Then why call it Krishna? There will be no form. Why call it Jesus?
These are simply symbols, linguistic symbols. You are acquainted with
the word <em>Jesus</em> so when that presence fills you and you become
part of it, a vibrating part of it, when you become a drop in that
ocean, how can you express it? You know the most beautiful word for you
may be <em>Jesus</em> or the most beautiful word may be <em>Buddha</em>
or <em>Krishna</em> – these words are fed into the mind so you have to
choose these certain words to indicate toward that presence.</p><p>But that presence is not an image, it is not a dream. It is not a
vision at all. You can use Jesus, you can use Krishna, you can use
Christ, or whatsoever name has appeal for you, whatsoever name has a
love-appeal for you, that’s up to you. That word and that name and that
image will come from your mind, but the experience itself is imageless.
It is not an imagination.</p><p>A Catholic priest was visiting a Zen master, Nan-in. Nan-in had never
heard about Jesus, so this Catholic priest thought, “It will be good. I
should go and read some parts from <em>The Sermon on the Mount</em>, and
I will see how Nan-in reacts. And people say that he is
enlightened.”</p><p>So that Catholic priest went to Nan-in and he said, “Master, I am a
Christian, and I have got a book and I love it. I would like to read
something from it just to know how you respond, how you react.” So he
read a few lines from <em>The</em></p><p>Sermon on the Mount<span class=p>, The New Testament. He translated
it into Japanese because Nan-in could understand only
Japanese.</span></p><p>When he started translating, the whole face of Nan-in changed
completely. Tears started flowing from his eyes and he said, “These are
the words of Buddha.”</p><p>The Christian priest said, “No, no, these are the words of
Jesus.”</p><p>But Nan-in said, “Whatsoever name you give, I feel these are the
words of the Buddha, because I know only Buddha and these words can come
only through Buddha. And if you say they have come through Jesus, then
Jesus was a buddha; that doesn’t make any difference. Then I will tell
my disciples that Jesus was a buddha.”</p><p><br></p><p>This will be the feeling. If you feel the presence of the divine,
then names are just immaterial. Names are bound to be different for
everyone because names come from education, names come from culture,
names come from the race you belong to. But that experience doesn’t
belong to any society, that experience doesn’t belong to any culture,
that experience doesn’t belong to your mind, the computer – it belongs
to you.</p><p>So remember, if you see visions, they are imagination. If you start
feeling presences, formless, existential experiences – enveloped in
them, merged in them, melting in them – then you are really in
contact.</p><p>You can call that presence Jesus, you can call that presence Buddha,
it depends on you; it makes no difference. Jesus is a buddha and Buddha
is a christ. Those who have gone beyond the mind have also gone beyond
personalities. They have also gone beyond forms. If Jesus and Buddha are
standing together, there will be two bodies but one soul. There will be
two bodies but not two presences, only one presence.</p><p>It is just as if you put two lamps in a room. There are two lamps,
just their bodies, but the light has become one. You cannot demarcate
that this light belongs to this lamp and that light belongs to that
lamp. The lights have merged. Only the material part of the lamp has
remained separate, but the non- material part has become one.</p><p>If Buddha and Jesus come close, if they stand together, you will see
two lamps, separate, but their lights have already merged. They have
become one. All those who have known truth have become one. Their names
are different for their followers; for them, now there are no names.</p><p>The fourth question:</p><p>Osho,</p><p>Please explain whether awareness is also one of the modifications of
the mind.</p><p>No, awareness is not part of the mind. It flows through the mind, but
it is not part of the mind. It is just like this bulb: the electricity
flows through it, but the electricity is not part of the bulb. If you
break the bulb you have not broken the electricity. The expression will
be hindered, but the potentiality remains hidden. You put in another
bulb and the electricity starts flowing.</p><p>Mind is just an instrument. Awareness is not part of it, but
awareness flows through it. When mind is transcended, awareness remains
in itself. That’s why I say even Buddha will have to use the mind if he
talks to you, if he relates to you, because then he will need flow, flow
of his inner pool. He will have to use instruments, mediums, and then
mind will function. But mind is just a vehicle.</p><p>You move in a vehicle, but you are not the vehicle. You go in a car
or you fly in an aircraft, but you are not the vehicle. Mind is just the
vehicle. And you are not using the mind to its total capacity. If you
use it to its total capacity, it will become right-knowledge.</p><p>We are using our mind like someone using an airplane as a bus. You
can cut the wings off the airplane and use it like a bus on the road.
That will do, it will work like a bus – but you are foolish. That bus
can fly! You are not using it to its right capacity.</p><p>You are using your mind for dreams, imaginations, madness. You have
not used it rightly, you have cut the wings off. If you use it with the
wings it can become right-knowledge, it can become wisdom. But that too
is part of the mind, that too is the vehicle. The user remains behind;
the user cannot be the used. <em>You</em> are using it, <em>you</em> are
awareness. And all the effort for meditation is meant to know this
awareness in its purity, without any medium, without any instrument. You
can know it only when mind has stopped functioning. When mind has
stopped functioning you will become aware that awareness is there, you
are filled with it. Mind was just a vehicle, a passage. Now if you want
you can use the mind, if you don’t want you need not use it.</p><p>Body and mind are both vehicles. You are not the vehicle, you are the
master hidden behind these vehicles. But you have forgotten completely.
And you have become the cart, you have become the vehicle. This is what
Gurdjieff calls identification. This is what in India yogis have called
<em>tadatmya,</em> becoming one with something which you are not.</p><p>The fifth question:</p><p>Osho,</p><p>Please explain how it is possible that just by looking, by witnessing
the recordings in the brain cells, the sources of thought-process can
cease to be.</p><p>They never cease to be, but by witnessing identification is broken.
Buddha lived in his body for forty years after his enlightenment, the
body did not cease. Continuously, for forty years he was talking,
explaining, making people understand what had happened to him and how
the same can happen to them. He was using the mind, the mind had not
ceased. And when he came back to his home town after twelve years he
recognized his father, he recognized his wife, he recognized his son.
The mind was there, the memory was there; otherwise recognition would
have been impossible. The mind had not really ceased.</p><p>When we say the mind ceases, we mean your identification is broken.
Now you know this is the mind and this is “I am.” The bridge is broken.
Now the mind is not the master. It has become just an instrument, it has
fallen to its right place. So whenever you need it you can use it. It is
just like this fan: if we want to use it we put it on, then the fan
starts functioning. Right now we are not using the fan so it is
non-functioning. But it is there, it has not ceased to be, any moment we
can use it. It has not disappeared.</p><p>By witnessing identification disappears, not the mind. But by
identification disappearing, you are a totally new being. For the first
time you have come to know your real phenomenon, your real reality. For
the first time you have come to know who you are. Now mind is just part
of the mechanism around you.</p><p>It is just as if you are a pilot and flying an airplane: you use many
instruments, your eyes are working on many instruments continuously
aware of this and that, but you are not the instruments.</p><p>This mind, this body and many functions of the body-mind, are just
around you – the mechanism. In this mechanism you can exist in two ways.
One way of existence is forgetting yourself and feeling as if you are
the mechanism. This is bondage, this is misery; this is the world, the
<em>sansar.</em></p><p>Another way of functioning is to become alert that you are separate,
you are different. Then you go on using, but now it makes a lot of
difference – now the mechanism is not you. And if something goes wrong
in the mechanism you can try to put it right, but you will not be
disturbed. Even if the whole mechanism disappears you will not be
disturbed.</p><p>Buddha dying and you dying are two different phenomena. Buddha knows
only the mechanism is dying. It has been used and now there is no need
of it. A burden has been removed, he is becoming free. Now he will move
without form. But you dying is totally different: you are suffering, you
are crying</p><p>because you feel <em>you</em> are dying, not the mechanism. It is
<em>your</em> death; then it becomes an intense suffering.</p><p>Just by witnessing, mind doesn’t cease and the brain cells will not
cease. Rather, they will become more alive because there will be less
conflict, more energy. They will become fresher, and you can use them
more rightly, more accurately, but you will not be burdened by them and
they will not force you to do something. They will not push and pull you
here and there. You will be the master.</p><p>But how does it happen just by witnessing? – because the bondage has
happened by <em>not</em> witnessing. The bondage has happened because
you are not alert, so the bondage will disappear if you become alert.
The bondage is only unawareness. Nothing else is needed but becoming
more alert, whatsoever you do.</p><p>You are sitting here listening to me. You can listen with awareness,
you can listen without awareness. Without awareness listening will also
be there, but it will be a different thing, the quality will differ.
Then your ears are listening and your mind is functioning somewhere
else.</p><p>Then, somehow, a few words will penetrate you and they will be mixed,
and your mind will interpret them in its own way. It will put its own
ideas into them. Everything will be a muddle and a mess. You have
listened but many things will be bypassed, you will not listen to many
things, you will choose. Then the whole thing will be distorted.</p><p>If you are alert, the moment you become alert thinking ceases. With
alertness you cannot think. The whole energy becomes alert, there is no
energy left to move into thinking. When you are alert even for a single
moment, you simply listen. There is no barrier. Your own words are not
there to get mixed in. You need not interpret. The impact is direct.</p><p>If you can listen with alertness, then what I am saying may be
meaningful or may not be meaningful, but your listening with alertness
will always be significant in meaning. That very alertness will make a
peak of your consciousness. The past will dissolve, the future will
disappear. You will be nowhere else, you will be just here and now.</p><p>In that moment of silence when thinking is not, you will be deep in
contact with your own source. And that source is bliss, and that source
is divine. So the only thing to be done is to do everything with
alertness.</p><p>The last question:</p><p>Osho,</p><p>While talking on Lao Tzu you become a Taoist sage, while talking on
Tantra you become a tantrika, while talking on bhakti you become an
enlightened bhakta, and while talking on Yoga you have become a perfect
yogi. Will you please explain how this phenomenon has become
possible?</p><p>If you are not, only then can it become possible. If you are, then it
cannot become possible. If you are not, if the host has completely
disappeared, then the guest becomes the host. So the guest may be Lao
Tzu, the guest may be Patanjali. The host is not there, so the guest
takes the place completely, he becomes the host. If you are not, then
you can become Patanjali; there is no difficulty. You can become
Krishna, you can become Christ. If <em>you</em> are there, then it is
very difficult. And if <em>you</em> are there, whatsoever you say will
be wrong. That’s why I say these are not commentaries. I am not
commenting on</p><p>Patanjali. I am simply absent, allowing Patanjali. So it is not a
commentary. “Commentary” means, “Patanjali is something separate, and I
am something</p><p>separate, and I am commenting on Patanjali” – it is bound to be
distorted because how can you comment on Patanjali? Whatsoever I say
would be <em>my</em> saying, and whatsoever I say would be <em>my</em>
interpretation. It cannot be of Patanjali himself. And that’s not good.
That is destructive. So I am not commenting at all. I am simply
allowing, and this allowing is possible if you are not.</p><p>If you become a witness, the ego disappears. And when the ego
disappears you become a vehicle, you become a passage, you become a
flute. And the flute can be put on Patanjali’s lips, and the flute can
be put on Krishna’s lips, and the flute can be put on Buddha’s lips –
the flute remains the same. But when it is on Buddha’s lips, Buddha is
flowing.</p><p>So this is not a commentary. This is difficult to understand because
you cannot allow. You are so much inside you cannot allow anyone. And
these are not persons. Patanjali is not a person: Patanjali is a
presence. If you are absent, his presence can function.</p><p>If you ask Patanjali, he will say the same. If you ask Patanjali, he
will not say that these sutras have been created by him. He will say,
“These are very ancient – <em>sanatan</em>.” He will say, “Millions and
millions of seers have seen them. I am just a vehicle. I am absent and
they are speaking.” If you ask Krishna, he will say, “I am not speaking.
This is the ancientmost message. It has been always so.” And if you ask
Jesus, he will say, “I am no more, I am not there.”</p><p>Why this insistence? Anybody who becomes absent, who becomes a non-
ego, starts functioning as a vehicle, as a passage for all that is true,
a passage for all that is hidden in existence, that can flow. And you
will be able to</p><p>understand whatsoever I am saying only when even for a few moments
you will be absent.</p><p>If you are too much there, your ego is there and then whatsoever I am
saying cannot flow in you. It is not only an intellectual communication.
It is something deeper.</p><p>If you are a non-ego even for a single moment, then the impact will
be felt. Then something unknown has entered into you, and in that moment
you will understand. And there is no other way to understand.</p><p>Enough for today.</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part6>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

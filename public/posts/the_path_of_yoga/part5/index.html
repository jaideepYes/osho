‌Chapter 2: Desireless, You Are Enlightened The first question:
Osho,
You said last night that total despair, frustration and hopelessness is the beginning ground for Yoga. This gives Yoga a pessimistic look. Is this pessimistic state really necessary to begin the path of Yoga? Can an optimist also begin with the path of Yoga?
It is neither pessimistic nor optimistic, because pessimism and optimism are two aspects of the same coin."><meta name=author content="Osho"><link rel=canonical href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_path_of_yoga/part5/><meta name=google-site-verification content="XYZabc"><meta name=yandex-verification content="XYZabc"><meta name=msvalidate.01 content="XYZabc"><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.b609c58d5c11bb90b1a54e04005d74ad1ddf22165eb79f5533967e57df9c3b50.css integrity="sha256-tgnFjVwRu5CxpU4EAF10rR3fIhZet59VM5Z+V9+cO1A=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=mask-icon href=https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_path_of_yoga/part5/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:title" content="Chapter 2: Desireless, You Are Enlightened"><meta property="og:description" content="< Previous | Contents | Next >

This gives Yoga a pessimistic look. Is this pessimistic state really necessary to begin the path of Yoga? Can an optimist also begin with the path of Yoga?\nIt is neither pessimistic nor optimistic, because pessimism and optimism are two aspects of the same coin. A pessimist is one who was an optimist in the past; an optimist is one who will be a pessimist in the future. All optimism leads to pessimism because every hope leads to hopelessness.\nIf you are still hoping then Yoga is not for you. The desire is there, hope is there; sansar, the world is there. Your desire is the world, your hope is the bondage, because hope will not allow you to be in the present. It will go on forcing you towards the future; it will not allow you to be centered. It will pull and push but it will not allow you to remain in a restful moment, in a state of stillness. It will not allow you.\nSo when I say total hopelessness I mean that hope has failed and hopelessness has also become futile. Then it is total hopelessness. Total hopelessness means even hopelessness is not there, because when you feel hopeless a subtle hope is there. Otherwise why should you feel hopeless? Hope is there, you are still clinging to it; hence the hopelessness.\nTotal hopelessness means now there is no hope. And when there is no hope there cannot be hopelessness. You have simply dropped the whole phenomenon. Both aspects have been thrown out, the whole coin has been dropped. In this state of mind you can enter the path of Yoga, never before. Before there is no possibility: hope is against Yoga.\nYoga is not pessimistic. You may be optimistic or pessimistic; Yoga is neither. If you are pessimistic you cannot enter on the path of Yoga because a pessimist clings to his miseries. He will not allow his miseries to disappear. An optimist clings to his hopes and a pessimist clings to his miseries, to his hopelessness. That hopelessness has become the companion. Yoga is for the one who is neither, who has become so totally hopeless that even to feel hopelessness is futile.\nThe opposite can be felt only if you go on clinging with the positive somewhere deep down. If you cling to hope you can feel hopelessness. If you cling to expectation you can feel frustration. If you simply come to realize that\nthere is no possibility of expecting anything, then where is the frustration? Then this is the nature of existence, that there is no possibility of expecting anything, there is no possibility of hope. When this becomes a certainty, how can you feel hopeless? Then both have disappeared.\nPatanjali says: Now the discipline of Yoga. That now will happen only when you are neither positive nor negative. Both pessimistic attitudes and optimistic attitudes are ill. But there are teachers who go on talking in terms of optimism, particularly American Christian missionaries. They go on talking in terms of hope, optimism, future, heaven. In the eyes of Patanjali that is just juvenile, childish, because you are simply giving a new disease. You are substituting a new disease for the old. You are unhappy and somehow you are seeking happiness. So whosoever gives you an assurance that, “This is the path that will lead you to happiness,” you will follow it. He is giving you hope, but the misery you are feeling so much is because of your past hopes; he is simply creating a future hell.\nYoga expects you to be more adult, more mature. Yoga says there is no possibility to expect anything; there is no possibility of any fulfillment in the future. There is no heaven in the future waiting for you and no God waiting for you with Christmas gifts. There is nobody waiting for you so don’t hanker after the future.\nWhen you become aware that there is nothing which is going to happen somewhere in the future, you will become alert here and now because there is nowhere to move. Then there is no way to tremble, a stillness happens to you. Suddenly you are in a deep rest. You cannot go anywhere; you are at home. Movement ceases, restlessness disappears. Now is the time to enter Yoga.\nPatanjali will not give you any hope. He respects you more than you respect yourself. He thinks you are mature and toys will not help. It is better to be alert to whatever is the case. But immediately when I say, “Total hopelessness” your mind will say, “This appears pessimistic,” because your mind lives through hope, your mind clings to desires, expectations.\nYou are so miserable right now that you will commit suicide if there is no hope. Really, if Patanjali is true, what will happen to you? If there is no hope, no future and you are thrown back to your present, you will commit suicide. Then there is nothing to live for. You live for something which will happen somewhere, sometime. It is not going to happen, but the feeling that it may happen helps you to stay alive.\nThat’s why I say when you have come to a point where suicide has become a meaningful thing, where life has lost all its meaning, where you can kill yourself, in that moment Yoga becomes possible because you will not be ready\nto transform yourself unless this intense futility of life has happened to you. You will be ready to transform yourself only when you feel there is no way except suicide or sadhana, either commit suicide or transform your being. When only two alternatives are left, only then is Yoga chosen, never before. But Yoga is not pessimistic. You are optimistic so Yoga appears to you as pessimistic. It is because of you.\nIn the West Buddha has been taken as the peak of pessimism because Buddha says life is dukkha, anguish. Therefore Western philosophers have been commenting that Buddha is a pessimist. Even a person like Albert Schweitzer, a person we can expect to know certain things, even he is in confusion. He thinks the whole East is pessimistic and this is a great criticism for him. The whole East – Buddha, Patanjali, Mahavira, Lao Tzu, are all pessimists for him. They do appear so; they appear so because they say your life is meaningless. Not that they say life is meaningless, but the life that you know. And unless this life becomes absolutely meaningless you cannot transcend it, you will cling to it.\nUnless you transcend this life, this mode of existence, you will not know what bliss is. But Buddha or Patanjali will not talk much about bliss because they have a deep compassion for you. If they start talking about bliss you again create a hope. You are incurable: you again create a hope. You say, “Okay! Then we can leave this life. If a more abundant life, a richer life is possible, then we can leave desires. If through leaving desires the deepest desire of reaching to the ultimate, the peak of bliss, is possible, then we can leave desires. But we can leave only for a greater desire.”\nThen where are you leaving? You are not leaving at all. You are simply substituting a different desire for the old one. And the new desire will be more dangerous than the old because you are already frustrated with the old. To get frustrated with the new you may again take even a few lives to come to a point where you can say God is useless, where you can say heaven is foolish, where you can say all future is nonsense.\nIt is not a question of worldly desires; it is a question of desire as such. Desiring must cease. Only then you become ready, only then you gather courage, only then the door opens and you can enter into the unknown. Hence, Patanjali’s first sutra: Now the discipline of Yoga.\nThe second question:\nOsho,\nIt is said that Yoga is an atheistic system. Do you agree with this?\nAgain, Yoga is neither. It is a simple science. It is neither theistic nor atheistic. Patanjali really is superb, a miracle of a man. He never talks about God. And even if he mentions God once, then too he says it is just one of the methods of reaching the ultimate. The belief in God is just a method to reach the ultimate – there is no God. To believe in God is just a technique, because through believing in God prayerfulness becomes possible; through believing in God surrender becomes possible. The significance is of surrender and prayerfulness, not of God.\nPatanjali is really unbelievable! He said God – the belief in God, the concept of God – is also one of the methods among many methods to reach the truth. Ishwara pranidhan – to believe in God is just a path. But it is not a necessity. You can choose something else. Buddha reaches to that ultimate reality without believing in God. He chooses a different path where God is not needed.\nYou have come to my house, you have passed through a certain street, but that street was not the goal, it was just instrumental. You could have reached to the same house through some other street; others have reached through other streets. On your street there may be green trees, big trees, on other streets there may not be. So God is just one path. Remember the distinction: God is not the goal. God is just one of the paths.\nPatanjali never denies, he never assumes. He is absolutely scientific. It is difficult for Christians to understand how Buddha could attain the ultimate truth, because he never believed in God. It is difficult for Hindus to understand how Mahavira could attain liberation, because he never believed in God.\nBefore the Western thinkers became alert about Eastern religions they always defined religion as God-centered. When they came upon Eastern thinking and they became aware that there has been a traditional path, a godless path reaching toward truth, they were shocked: “It is impossible!”\nH. G. Wells has written about Buddha that Buddha is the most godless man and yet the most godly. He never believed and he will never tell anybody to believe in any God, but he himself is the suprememost phenomenon of the happening of divine being. Mahavira too travels a path where God is not needed.\nPatanjali is absolutely scientific: he says we are not related with means, there are a thousand and one means – the goal is the truth. Some have achieved it through God, so it is okay – believe in God and achieve the goal, because when the goal is achieved you will throw away your belief. So belief is just instrumental. If you don’t believe it is okay, don’t believe, and travel the path of belieflessness and reach the goal.\nHe is neither theist nor atheist. He is not creating a religion, he is simply\nshowing you all the paths that are possible and all the laws that work in your transformation. God is one of those paths, it is not a must. If you are godless there is no need to be non-religious. Patanjali says you can also reach, so be godless, don’t bother about God. These are the laws and these are the experiments; this is the meditation – pass through it.\nHe does not insist on any concept. It was very difficult. That’s why the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali are rare, unique. Such a book has never happened before and there is no possibility of its happening again, because whatsoever can be written about Yoga he has written, he has left nothing out. No one can add anything to it. Never in the future is there any possibility to create another work like Patanjali’s Yoga Sutras. He has finished the job completely, and he could do this so totally because he is not partial. If he were partial then he could not do it so totally.\nBuddha is partial, Mahavira is partial, Jesus is partial, Mohammed is partial – they have a certain path. And their partiality may be because of you, because of a deep compassion for you. They insist on a certain path, they go on insisting their whole life. And they say, “Everything else is wrong, this is the right path,” just to create faith in you. You are so faithless; you are so filled with doubt that if they say, “This path leads, others’ paths also lead,” you will not follow any. They insist that only this path leads.\nThis is not true. This is just a device for you because if you feel any uncertainty in them, if they say, “This also leads, that also leads; this is also true, that is also true,” you will become uncertain. You are already uncertain. You need someone who is absolutely certain. Just to look certain to you they have pretended to be partial.\nBut if you are partial you cannot cover the whole ground. Patanjali is not partial. He is less concerned with you, more concerned with the past designs of the path. He will not use a lie; he will not use a device, he will not compromise with you. No scientist can compromise.\nBuddha can compromise. He has compassion, he is not treating you scientifically. A very deep human feeling is there for you; he can even lie just to help you. You cannot understand the truth so he compromises with you.\nPatanjali will not compromise with you. Whatsoever is the fact, he will talk about the fact. And he will not descend a single step to meet you, he is absolutely uncompromising. Science has to be. Science cannot compromise; otherwise it will itself become a religion. He is neither atheist nor theist. He is neither Hindu nor Mohammedan nor Christian nor Jaina nor Buddhist. He is absolutely a scientific seeker just revealing whatsoever is the case, revealing without any myth. He will not use a single parable. Jesus will talk in stories\nbecause you are children and you can only understand stories. He will talk in parables. Buddha uses many stories just to help you to attain a little glimpse.\nI was reading about a Hassid, a Jewish master, Baal Shem. He was a rabbi in a small village, and whenever there was some trouble, some disease, some calamity in the village, he would move into the forest. He would go to a certain spot under a certain tree and there he would do some ritual and then he would pray to God. And it always happened that the calamity would leave the village, the illness would disappear from the village, the trouble would go.\nThen Baal Shem died. His successor came. Then a problem arose again, the village was in trouble. There was some calamity and the villagers asked the successor, the new rabbi, to go to the forest and pray to God. The new rabbi was very much disturbed because he was unacquainted with the spot, the exact tree. But still he went, stopped under any tree. He burned the fire, did the ritual and prayed and said to God, “Look, I don’t know the exact spot my master used to come to, but you know. You are omnipotent, you are omnipresent, so you know, so there is no need to seek for the exact spot. My village is in some trouble, so listen and do something.” The calamity was gone.\nThen when this rabbi died and his successor was there, again the problem came. The village was in a certain crisis and they came to him. The rabbi was disturbed, he had even forgotten the prayer. So he went into the forest, chose any place. He didn’t know how to burn the ritual fire but anyhow he burned a fire and said to God, “Listen, I don’t know how to burn the ritual fire, I don’t know the exact spot and I have forgotten the prayer. But you are all-knowing so you know already; there is no need for me to know. So do whatsoever is needed.” And he came back and the village passed through the crisis.\nThen he also died. Again the successor… And again the village was in trouble, so they came. He was sitting in his armchair. He said to God, “I don’t want to go anywhere. Listen, you are everywhere. I don’t know the prayer, I don’t know any ritual. But that doesn’t matter; my knowing is not the point. You know everything. What is the use of praying and what is the use of a ritual and what is the use of a particular sacred spot? I know only the story of my successors. I will tell you the story that happened in Baal Shem’s time, then his successor, then his successor: this is the story. Now do the right thing and this is enough.” And the calamity disappeared. It is said that God loved the story so much.\nPeople love their stories, and the people’s God also loves stories, and through stories you can have certain glimpses. But Patanjali will not use a\nsingle parable. I told you he is just Einstein plus Buddha, a very rare combination. He has the inner witnessing of Buddha and the mechanism of mind of an Einstein, but he is neither.\nTheism is a story, atheism is the anti-story. They are just myths, man-created parables. To some the one appeals, to some the other. Patanjali is not interested in stories or myths, he is interested in the naked truth. He will not even clothe it, he will not put on any dressing, he will not decorate it. That is not his way, remember this.\nWe will move on a very dry land, a desert-like land. But the desert has its own beauty. It has no trees, it has no rivers, but it has a vastness of its own. No forest can be compared to it. Forests have their own beauty, hills have their own beauty, rivers their own beauty. The desert has its own vast infinity.\nWe will be moving through desert-land. Courage is needed. He will not give you a single tree to rest under. He will not give you any story, just the bare facts. He will not use even a single superfluous word; hence the word sutra. Sutra means the basic minimum.\nA sutra is not even a complete sentence. It is just the essential, just as when you write a telegram you cut out superfluous words. Then it becomes a sutra because only ten words or nine words can be put in it. If you were going to write a letter you would fill ten pages, and even in ten pages the message would not be complete. But in a telegram in ten words it is not only complete, it is more than complete. It hits the heart, the very essence is there.\nPatanjali’s sutras are telegrams. He is a miser, he will not use a single superfluous word. So how can he tell stories? – he cannot. And don’t expect it. So don’t ask whether he is a theist or an atheist; those are stories.\nPhilosophers have created many stories, and it is a game. If you like the game of atheism, be an atheist. If you like the game of theism, be a theist. But these are games, not the reality. Reality is something else. Reality is concerned with you, not what you believe. The reality is you, not what you believe. The reality is behind the mind, not in the contents of the mind. Because theism is a content of the mind, atheism is a content of the mind, something in the mind. Hinduism is a content of the mind or Christianity is a content of the mind.\nPatanjali is concerned with the beyond, not with the content. He says, “Throw out this whole mind. Whatsoever it contains, it is useless.” You may be carrying beautiful philosophies; Patanjali will say, “Throw them out! All is rubbish.” It is difficult. If someone says, “Your Bible is rubbish, your Gita is rubbish, your scriptures are rubbish, rot, throw them away,” you will be shocked. But this is how it is going to happen. Patanjali cannot make any compromise with you. He is uncompromising and that’s the beauty. And that is\nhis uniqueness.\nThe third question:\nOsho,\nYou talked about the significance of discipleship on the path of Yoga, but how can an atheist be a disciple?\nNeither a theist nor an atheist can be a disciple. They have already taken an attitude, they have already decided, so what is the point of being a disciple? If you already know how can you be a disciple? Discipleship means the realization that, “I don’t know.” Atheists, theists – no, they cannot be disciples.\nAnd if you believe in something you will miss the beauty of disciplehood. If you know something already, that knowing will give you ego; it will not make you humble. That’s why pundits and scholars miss. Sometimes sinners have reached, but scholars never. They know too much, they are so clever. Their cleverness is the disease that becomes their suicide. They won’t listen because they are not ready to learn.\nDisciplehood simply means an attitude to learn, a moment-to-moment remaining aware that “I don’t know.” This knowing that “I don’t know,” this awareness that “I am ignorant” gives you opening. Then you are not closed. The moment you say “I know” you are a closed circle; the door is no longer open. But when you say “I don’t know” it means you are ready to learn, the door is open.\nIf you have already reached, concluded, you cannot be a disciple. One has to be in a receptive mood. One has to be completely aware that the real is unknown, “And whatsoever I know is trivial, is just rubbish.” What do you know? You may have gathered much information but that is not knowledge. You may have accumulated much dust through universities; that is not knowledge. You may know about Buddha, you may know about Jesus, but that is not knowledge. Unless you become a Buddha there is no knowledge. Unless you are a Jesus there is no knowledge.\nKnowledge comes through being, not through memory. You can have a trained memory; memory is just a mechanism. It will not give you a richer being. It may give you nightmarish dreams but it will not give you a richer being. You will remain the same, covered with much dust. Knowledge, and particularly the ego that comes through knowledge – the feeling that “I know” – closes you. Now you cannot be a disciple. And if you cannot be a disciple you cannot enter the discipline of Yoga. So come to the door of Yoga ignorant, aware of your ignorance, alert that you don’t know. And I will tell you: this is\nthe only knowledge which will help, the knowledge that “I don’t know.”\nThis will make you humble. A subtle humility will come to you. The ego, by and by, will subside. Knowing that you don’t know, how can you be egoistic? Knowledge is the most subtle food for the ego: you feel you are something. You know, therefore you become somebody.\nJust two days ago I initiated a girl from the West into sannyas and I gave her a name, Yoga Sambodhi, and I asked her, “Will it be easy for you to pronounce?” She said, “Yes. It looks just like the English word somebody.” But sambodhi is quite the opposite. When you become nobody, then sambodhi happens. Sambodhi means enlightenment. If you are somebody, sambodhi will never happen. That “somebodiness” is the barrier.\nWhen you feel you are nobody, when you feel you are nothing, suddenly you are available for many mysteries to happen to you. Your doors are open. The sun can rise, the sunrays can penetrate you. Your gloom, your darkness, will disappear. But you are closed. The sun may be knocking on the door but there is no opening, not even a window is open.\nAtheists or theists, Hindus or Mohammedans, Christians or Buddhists, cannot enter on the path. They believe they have already reached Buddha without reaching anywhere. They have concluded without any realization. They have words in the mind, concepts, theories, scriptures – and the more the burden, the more dead they are.\nThe fourth question:\nOsho,\nYou said that Yoga does not ask for any faith. But if a disciple needs faith, surrender and trust in the master as a basic condition, then how is the first statement valid?\nI did not say that Yoga doesn’t ask for faith. I said Yoga doesn’t ask for any belief. Faith is totally different, trust is totally different. Belief is an intellectual thing, but faith is a very deep intimacy, it is not intellectual. You love a master, then you trust and there is faith. But this faith is not in any concept, it is in the very person. And this is not a condition, it is not required. Remember this distinction: it is not required that you must have faith in the master, it is not a precondition. All that is said is this: if trust happens between you and the master, then satsang will be possible. It is just a situation, not a condition. Nothing is required.\nJust as with love: if love happens then marriage can follow, but you cannot make love a condition that first you must love and then marriage will follow. But then you will ask, “How can one love?” If it happens it happens, if it is not\nhappening it is not happening. You cannot do anything. So you cannot force trust.\nIn the old days seekers would roam all over the world. They would roam from one master to another, just waiting for the phenomenon to happen. You cannot force it. You may pass through many masters just in a search to see if somewhere something clicks. Then the thing has happened; it is not a condition. You cannot go to a master and try to trust him. How can you try to trust? The very trying, the very effort shows you don’t trust. How can you try to love someone? If you try, the whole thing has become false. It is a happening.\nBut unless this happens, satsang will not be possible. Then the master cannot give his grace to you. Not that he will prevent himself from giving; you are not available. He cannot do anything, you are not open.\nThe sun may be waiting near the window but if it is closed, what can the sun do? The rays will reflect back. They will come, knock on the door, and go back. Remember, it is not a condition that you open the door and the sun will rise, it is not a condition! The sun may not be there, it may be night. Just by opening your door you cannot create the sun. Your opening of the door is just your being available: if the sun is there it can enter.\nSo seekers will move, will have to move from one master to another. The only thing to remember is that they must remain open and they should not judge. If you come near a master and you don’t feel any tuning with him, move, but don’t judge, because your judgment will be wrong. You have never been in contact. Unless you love you don’t know, so don’t judge. Simply say, “This master is not for me, I am not for this master. The thing has not happened.” You simply move.\nIf you start judging then you are closing yourself for other masters also. You may have to pass through many, many situations, but remember this: don’t judge. Whenever you feel that something is wrong with the master, move on. That means you cannot trust. Something has gone wrong, you cannot trust. But don’t say the master is wrong, because you don’t know! You simply move on, that’s enough. You seek somewhere else.\nIf you start judging, condemning, concluding, then you will be closed. And the eyes which judge will never be able to trust. Once you have become a victim of judgment you will never be able to trust because you will find something or other which will help you not to trust, which will give you a closing.\nSo don’t trust, don’t judge, move on. Someday, if you go on moving, the thing is bound to happen. Someday, somewhere, in some moment – because\nthere are moments; you cannot do anything about them. When you are vulnerable and when the master is flowing you meet. In a certain point of time and space, the meeting happens. Then satsang becomes possible.\nSatsang means to be in close proximity with a master, with a man who has known, because then he can flow. He is already flowing. Sufis say that that’s enough; just to be in close proximity to a master is enough. Just to sit near him, just to walk by his side, just to sit outside his room, just to watch in the night sitting outside his wall, just to go on remembering, that is enough.\nBut it takes years, many years of waiting. And he will not treat you well, remember – he will create every type of hindrance. He will give you many chances to judge. He will spread rumors about himself so you can think that he is wrong and you can escape. He will help you in every way to escape. Unless you pass all these necessary hurdles, and they are necessary because a cheap trust is of no use – it needs a seasoned trust which has waited long and has become a strong rock – only then can the deepest layers be penetrated.\nPatanjali doesn’t say that you will have to believe. Belief is intellectual. You believe in Hinduism, it is not your trust. It is just that accidentally you were born in a Hindu family. And so you have heard; from the very childhood you have been impregnated. You have been impressed with theories, concepts, philosophies, systems. They have become part of your blood. They have just fallen into your unconscious, you believe in them. But that belief is of no use because it has not transformed you, it is a dead thing, borrowed.\nTrust is never a dead thing. You cannot borrow trust from your family; it is a personal phenomenon. You will have to come to it. Hinduism is traditional, Mohammedanism is traditional.\nThat’s why the sangham, the first group around Mohammed, were the real Mohammedans because it was a trust for them; they had come personally to the master. They had lived with the master in close proximity, they had satsang. They believed in Mohammed, and Mohammed is not a man to be easily trusted – difficult. If you had been to Mohammed you would have had to resist him, it was impossible to believe in such a man. He had nine wives. He had a sword in his hand and on his sword was written, “Peace is the motto”; the word islam means peace. How can you believe this man?\nYou can believe in a Mahavira when he says, “Nonviolence”; he is nonviolent. Obviously, you can believe in Mahavira. How can you believe in Mohammed with a sword? And he says, “Love is the message and peace is the motto.” You cannot believe. This man is creating hurdles.\nHe was a Sufi; he was a master. He would create every difficulty. So if your mind still functioned, you doubted, you were skeptical, you could escape. But\nif you remained, waited, if you had patience – and infinite patience would have been needed – someday you would come to know Mohammed, you would become a Mohammedan. Just by knowing him you would become a Mohammedan.\nThe first group of disciples was a totally different thing. The first group of disciples of Buddha was a totally different thing. Now Buddhists are dead, Mohammedans are dead. They are traditionally Mohammedans.\nTruth cannot be transferred like property. Your parents cannot give you truth. They can give you property because the property belongs to the world. Truth doesn’t belong to the world, they cannot give it to you; they cannot have it as a treasure. They cannot have it in the bank so that it can be transferred to you. You will have to seek on your own. You will have to suffer and you will have to become a disciple and you will have to pass through rigorous discipline. It will be a personal happening. Truth is always personal: it happens to a person. Trust is different, belief is different. Belief is given by others, trust is earned by you.\nPatanjali doesn’t require any belief. But without trust nothing can be done, without trust nothing is possible. But you cannot force it. Understand, you cannot force your trust; it is not in your hands to force it. If you force, it will be false, and no trust is better than a false trust, because you are wasting yourself. It is better to move somewhere else where the real can happen.\nDon’t judge, go on moving: someday, somewhere, your master is waiting. And the master cannot be shown to you – “Go here and this will be your master.” You will have to seek, you will have to suffer, because through suffering and seeking you will be able to see him. Your eyes will become clear. The tears will disappear, your eyes will be unclouded and you will realize that this is the master.\nIt is reported that one of the Sufis named Junnaid went to an old fakir and said to him, “I have heard that you know. Show me the path.”\nThe old man said, “You have heard that I know. You don’t know. Look at me and feel.”\nThe man said, “I cannot feel anything. Just do one thing, just show me the path where I can find my master.”\nSo the old man said, “Go first to Mecca. Do the pilgrimage and search for such and such a man. He will be sitting under a tree. His eyes will be such, they will be throwing light, and you will feel a certain perfume like musk around him. Go and seek.”\nAnd Junnaid traveled and traveled for twenty years. Wherever he heard\nthere was a master, he would go. But neither was the tree there, nor the perfume, the musk, nor those eyes the old man has described. The personality was not there. And he had a ready-made formula, so he would judge immediately, “This is not my master,” and he would move on. After twenty years he reached under a tree – the master was there. The musk was floating in the air just like a haze around the man. The eyes were fiery, a red light was flowing. This was the man! He fell at his feet and said, “Master, I have been searching for you for twenty years.”\nThe master said, “I have also been waiting for you for twenty years. Look again.”\nHe looked, and saw that this was the same man who twenty years before had told him the way to find the master. Junnaid started weeping. He said, “What? You played a joke on me? Twenty years wasted! Why couldn’t you have said that you are my master?”\nThe old man said, “That would not have helped. That would not have been of any use because you did not have eyes to see. These twenty years helped you to see me. I am the same man, but twenty years ago you told me ‘I don’t feel anything.’ I am the same, but now you have become capable to feel. You have changed. These twenty years rubbed you hard – all the dust has fallen, your mind is clear. This fragrance of musk was also there that time but you were not capable of smelling it. Your nose was closed, your eyes were not functioning, and your heart was not really beating so contact was not possible.”\nYou don’t know, and nobody can say where the trust will happen. I don’t say trust the master. I simply say find the person where trust happens – that person is your master. And you cannot do anything about it. You will have to wander. The thing is certain to happen, but the seeking is necessary because seeking prepares you. Not that the seeking leads you to the master: seeking prepares you so that you can see. He may be just near you…\nThe fifth question:\nOsho,\nLast night you spoke of satsang and the importance of the disciple’s proximity to the guru. Does this mean physical proximity? Is the disciple who lives at a great physical distance from the guru at a loss?\nYes and no. Yes, a physical closeness is necessary in the beginning because as you are, you cannot understand anything else right now. You can understand the body, you can understand the language of the physical. You exist at the\nphysical, so yes, a physical closeness is necessary in the beginning.\nAnd I also say no, because as you grow, as you start learning a different language which is of the non-physical, then physical closeness is not necessary. Then you can go anywhere. Then space doesn’t make any difference, you remain in contact. Not only space, but time also doesn’t make any difference. A master may be dead, you remain in contact. He may have dropped his physical body, you remain in contact. If a trust happens, then both time and space are transcended.\nTrust is the miracle. You can be in closeness with Mohammed or Jesus or Buddha right now if trust is there. But it is difficult because you don’t know how. You cannot trust a living person, how can you trust a dead one? But if trust happens, then you are close to Buddha right now. And for persons who have faith, Buddha is alive. No master ever dies for those who can trust. He goes on helping, he is always there. But for you, even if Buddha is there physically standing behind you or in front of you, just sitting by your side, you are not close to him. There may be vast space between you. Love, trust, faith destroy both space and time.\nIn the beginning, because you cannot understand any other language, you can understand only the language of the physical, physical closeness is necessary – but only in the beginning. A moment will come when the master himself will send you away. He will force you to go away because that too becomes necessary or you may start clinging to the physical language.\nAll of his life, Gurdjieff nearly always sent his disciples away. He would create such a miserable situation for them that they would have to leave. It would be impossible to live with him. After a certain point he would help them to go away. He would really force them to go away, because one should not become too much dependent on the physical. The other, the higher language, must develop. You must start feeling close to him wherever you are, because the body has to be transcended. Not only your body, but the master’s body also has to be transcended.\nBut in the beginning physical closeness is a great help. Once the seeds are sown, once they have taken root, then you are strong enough. Then you can go away and still you can feel. If just by going away the contact is lost, then the contact is not of much importance. Trust will grow more the further away you go. Trust will grow more, because wherever you are on the earth you will start feeling the master’s presence continuously. The trust will grow. He will be helping you now through hidden hands, invisible hands. He will be working on you through your dreams and you will feel that constantly, like a shadow, he is following you.\nBut that is a very developed language. Don’t try it from the very beginning because then you can deceive yourself. So I will say, move step by step. Wherever trust happens, then close your eyes and follow blindly. Really, the moment trust happens you have closed your eyes. Then what is the use of thinking, arguing? Trust has happened and trust will not listen to anything now. Then follow, and remain close unless the master himself sends you away. And when he sends you away then don’t cling. Then follow his instruction and go away, because he knows better. And he knows what is helpful.\nSometimes just being near the master may make it difficult for you to grow, just as under a big tree a new seed will have many difficulties to grow. Under a big tree a new tree will become crippled. Even trees take care to throw their seed far away so that the seeds can sprout. The trees use many tricks to send the seed away. Otherwise they will die if they fall down just under the big tree; there is so much shadow, no sun reaches there, no sunrays reach.\nSo a master knows better. If he feels that you should go away, then don’t resist. Then simply follow and go away. This going away will be a coming nearer to him. If you can follow, if you can silently follow without any resistance, then this going away will be a coming nearer. You will attain a new closeness.\nThe sixth question:\nOsho,\nWhen you ask us to understand something clearly, whom do you address to understand? Mind has to cease. Therefore, it is no use trying to make the mind understand anything. Who should understand then?\nYes, mind has to cease, but it has not ceased yet. Mind has to be worked on. An understanding has to be created in the mind: through that understanding this mind will die. That understanding is just like poison: you take the poison – you are the taker and the poison kills you. The mind understands, but the understanding is poison for the mind. That’s why the mind resists so much. It tries and tries not to understand, it creates doubt, it fights. In every way it protects itself because understanding is poison for the mind. It is elixir for you, but for the mind it is poison.\nSo when I say understand clearly, I mean your mind, not you, because you need not have any understanding, you are already understanding. You are the very wisdom, the pragnya. You need no help from me or from anybody else.\nYour mind has to be changed. And if understanding happens to the mind, mind will die, and with the mind the understanding will disappear. Then you\nwill be in your purity; your being will reveal a mirror-like purity – no content, contentless. But that inner being needs no understanding; it is already the very core of understanding. It needs no understanding, just the clouds of the mind have to be persuaded.\nReally, understanding is just a persuasion for the mind to leave. Remember, I don’t say fight, I say persuasion. If you fight, the mind will never leave because through fight you show your fear. If you fight you show that the mind is something you are afraid of. Just persuade. All these teachings, all meditations are a deep persuasion for the mind to come to a point where it can commit suicide, where it simply drops, where mind itself becomes such an absurdity that you cannot carry it anymore – you simply drop it. It is better to say mind drops itself.\nSo when I say clear understanding, I am addressing your mind. And there is no other way. Only your mind can be approached because you are unavailable. You are so hidden deep inside, and just the mind is at the door. The mind has to be persuaded to leave the door and to leave the door open so you will become available.\nI am addressing mind – your mind, not you. If mind drops there is no need to address. I can sit in silence and you will understand; there is no need to address. The mind needs words, the mind needs thoughts, the mind needs something mental which can persuade it. When Buddha or Patanjali or Krishna talk to you, they are addressing your mind.\nA moment comes when mind simply becomes aware of the whole absurdity. It is just like this: I see that you are pulling the strings of your shoelaces, trying to pull yourself up by them, and I tell you, “What nonsense you are doing! This is impossible. You cannot pull yourself up just by your own shoelaces. It is simply impossible, it cannot happen.” So I persuade you to think more about the whole thing: “This is absurd. What are you doing?” And then you feel miserable because it is not happening. So I go on telling you, insisting, hammering, and one day you may become aware, “Yes, this is absurd. What am I doing?”\nThe whole effort of the mind is just like pulling yourself up by your own shoelaces. Whatsoever you are doing is absurd. It can never lead you anywhere other than to hell, than to misery. It has always led you to misery, but you are still not aware. All this communication from me is just to make your mind alert that the whole effort is absurd. Once you come to feel that the whole effort is absurd, the effort disappears. It is not that you will have to leave your shoelaces and you will have to make some effort and it is going to be arduous: you will simply see the fact and you will stop and you will laugh. If you drop your\nshoelaces and simply stand and laugh, you have become enlightened. This is going to be the case.\nThrough understanding the mind drops. Suddenly you become aware that no one else was responsible for your misery, you were creating it; continuously, moment to moment, you were the creator. And you were creating the misery and then you were asking how to go beyond it, how to not be miserable, how to achieve bliss, how to achieve samadhi. And even as you are asking, you are creating. Even this asking, “How to achieve samadhi?” is creating misery because then you say, “I have been making so much effort and samadhi has not been attained yet. I am doing everything that can be done and the samadhi has not been attained yet. When will I become enlightened?”\nNow you create a new misery when you make enlightenment also an object of desire, which is absurd. No desire will come to a fulfillment. When you realize this, desires drop – you are enlightened. Desireless, you are enlightened. With desires you go moving in a circle of misery.\nThe last question:\nOsho,\nYou said that Yoga is a science, a methodology for inner awakening. But effort to be, to go nearer to no-mind, implies motivation and hope. Even to undergo the process of inner transformation implies motivation. Then how can one move on the path of Yoga without hope and motivation? Does not waiting even imply motivation?\nYes, you cannot move on the path of Yoga with motivation, with desire, with hope. Really, there is no movement on the path of Yoga. When you come to understand that all desire is absurd, all desire is misery, then there is nothing to do, because every doing will be a new desire. There is nothing to do! You simply cannot do anything because whatsoever you do will lead you into a new misery. Then you don’t do. Desires have dropped, mind has ceased, and this is Yoga. You have entered. This is not a movement, this is a stillness. Problems arise because of language. When I say that you have entered, it appears that you have moved. All movement ceases when desire ceases. You are in Yoga: Now the discipline of Yoga.\nWith motivation, in the name of Yoga you will again create other miseries. Every day people come to me and they say: “I have been practicing Yoga for thirty years, nothing has happened.” But who told you that something is going to happen? You must be waiting for something to happen, that’s why nothing has happened. Yoga says, don’t wait for the future.\nYou meditate, but you meditate with the motive that through meditation you will reach somewhere, some goal. You are missing the point. Meditate and\nenjoy it! There is no goal, there is no future, no further; there is nothing ahead. Meditate, enjoy it without any motivation, and suddenly the goal is there. Suddenly the clouds disappear because they were created by your desire. Your motivation is the smoke which creates the clouds, and they have disappeared. So play with the meditation; enjoy it. Don’t make it a means. It is the end. This is the whole point to be understood.\nDon’t create new desires. Understand the very nature of desire – that it is misery. Just try to understand the nature of desire and you will come to know that it is misery. Then what is to be done? Nothing is to be done! Becoming alert that desire is misery, desire drops: Now the discipline of Yoga. You have entered the path.\nAnd it depends on your intensity. If your realization that desire is misery is so deep, so total, you have not only entered Yoga, you have become a siddha. You have reached the goal. It will depend on your intensity. If the intensity is total then you have reached the goal. If your intensity is not so total you have entered the path.\nEnough for today.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"8434","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_path_of_yoga/part5/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_path_of_yoga/>The Path of Yoga</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter 2: Desireless, You Are Enlightened</h1><div class=post-meta>40 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;8434 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Path_of_Yoga/part5.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part4>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

is the beginning ground for Yoga. This gives Yoga a pessimistic look. Is
this pessimistic state really necessary to begin the path of Yoga? Can
an optimist also begin with the path of Yoga?</p><p>It is neither pessimistic nor optimistic, because pessimism and
optimism are two aspects of the same coin. A pessimist is one who was an
optimist in the past; an optimist is one who will be a pessimist in the
future. All optimism leads to pessimism because every hope leads to
hopelessness.</p><p>If you are still hoping then Yoga is not for you. The desire is
there, hope is there; <em>sansar</em>, the world is there. Your desire
is the world, your hope is the bondage, because hope will not allow you
to be in the present. It will go on forcing you towards the future; it
will not allow you to be centered. It will pull and push but it will not
allow you to remain in a restful moment, in a state of stillness. It
will not allow you.</p><p>So when I say total hopelessness I mean that hope has failed and
hopelessness has also become futile. Then it is total hopelessness.
Total hopelessness means even hopelessness is not there, because when
you feel hopeless a subtle hope is there. Otherwise why should you feel
hopeless? Hope is there, you are still clinging to it; hence the
hopelessness.</p><p>Total hopelessness means now there is no hope. And when there is no
hope there cannot be hopelessness. You have simply dropped the whole
phenomenon. Both aspects have been thrown out, the whole coin has been
dropped. In this state of mind you can enter the path of Yoga, never
before. Before there is no possibility: hope is against Yoga.</p><p>Yoga is not pessimistic. You may be optimistic or pessimistic; Yoga
is neither. If you are pessimistic you cannot enter on the path of Yoga
because a pessimist clings to his miseries. He will not allow his
miseries to disappear. An optimist clings to his hopes and a pessimist
clings to his miseries, to his hopelessness. That hopelessness has
become the companion. Yoga is for the one who is neither, who has become
so totally hopeless that even to feel hopelessness is futile.</p><p>The opposite can be felt only if you go on clinging with the positive
somewhere deep down. If you cling to hope you can feel hopelessness. If
you cling to expectation you can feel frustration. If you simply come to
realize that</p><p>there is no possibility of expecting anything, then where is the
frustration? Then this is the nature of existence, that there is no
possibility of expecting anything, there is no possibility of hope. When
this becomes a certainty, how can you feel hopeless? Then both have
disappeared.</p><p>Patanjali says: <em>Now the discipline of Yoga</em>. That
<em>no</em>w will happen only when you are neither positive nor
negative. Both pessimistic attitudes and optimistic attitudes are
ill. But there are teachers who go on talking in terms of optimism,
particularly American Christian missionaries. They go on talking in
terms of hope, optimism, future, heaven. In the eyes of Patanjali that
is just juvenile, childish, because you are simply giving a new disease.
You are substituting a new disease for the old. You are unhappy and
somehow you are seeking happiness. So whosoever gives you an assurance
that, “This is the path that will lead you to happiness,” you will
follow it. He is giving you hope, but the misery you are feeling so much
is because of your past hopes; he is simply creating a future hell.</p><p>Yoga expects you to be more adult, more mature. Yoga says there is no
possibility to expect anything; there is no possibility of any
fulfillment in the future. There is no heaven in the future waiting for
you and no God waiting for you with Christmas gifts. There is nobody
waiting for you so don’t hanker after the future.</p><p>When you become aware that there is nothing which is going to happen
somewhere in the future, you will become alert here and now because
there is nowhere to move. Then there is no way to tremble, a stillness
happens to you. Suddenly you are in a deep rest. You cannot go anywhere;
you are at home. Movement ceases, restlessness disappears. Now is the
time to enter Yoga.</p><p>Patanjali will not give you any hope. He respects you more than you
respect yourself. He thinks you are mature and toys will not help. It is
better to be alert to whatever is the case. But immediately when I say,
“Total hopelessness” your mind will say, “This appears pessimistic,”
because your mind lives through hope, your mind clings to desires,
expectations.</p><p>You are so miserable right now that you will commit suicide if there
is no hope. Really, if Patanjali is true, what will happen to you? If
there is no hope, no future and you are thrown back to your present, you
will commit suicide. Then there is nothing to live for. You live for
something which will happen somewhere, sometime. It is not going to
happen, but the feeling that it may happen helps you to stay alive.</p><p>That’s why I say when you have come to a point where suicide has
become a meaningful thing, where life has lost all its meaning, where
you can kill yourself, in that moment Yoga becomes possible because you
will not be ready</p><p>to transform yourself unless this intense futility of life has
happened to you. You will be ready to transform yourself only when you
feel there is no way except suicide or <em>sadhana,</em> either commit
suicide or transform your being. When only two alternatives are left,
only then is Yoga chosen, never before. But Yoga is not pessimistic. You
are optimistic so Yoga appears to you as pessimistic. It is because of
you.</p><p>In the West Buddha has been taken as the peak of pessimism because
Buddha says life is <em>dukkha,</em> anguish. Therefore Western
philosophers have been commenting that Buddha is a pessimist. Even a
person like Albert Schweitzer, a person we can expect to know certain
things, even he is in confusion. He thinks the whole East is pessimistic
and this is a great criticism for him. The whole East – Buddha,
Patanjali, Mahavira, Lao Tzu, are all pessimists for him. They do appear
so; they appear so because they say your life is meaningless. Not that
they say life is meaningless, but the life that <em>you</em> know. And
unless this life becomes absolutely meaningless you cannot transcend it,
you will cling to it.</p><p>Unless you transcend this life, this mode of existence, you will not
know what bliss is. But Buddha or Patanjali will not talk much about
bliss because they have a deep compassion for you. If they start talking
about bliss you again create a hope. You are incurable: you again create
a hope. You say, “Okay! Then we can leave this life. If a more abundant
life, a richer life is possible, then we can leave desires. If through
leaving desires the deepest desire of reaching to the ultimate, the peak
of bliss, is possible, then we can leave desires. But we can leave only
for a greater desire.”</p><p>Then where are you leaving? You are not leaving at all. You are
simply substituting a different desire for the old one. And the new
desire will be more dangerous than the old because you are already
frustrated with the old. To get frustrated with the new you may again
take even a few lives to come to a point where you can say God is
useless, where you can say heaven is foolish, where you can say all
future is nonsense.</p><p>It is not a question of worldly desires; it is a question of desire
<em>as such</em>. Desiring must cease. Only then you become ready, only
then you gather courage, only then the door opens and you can enter into
the unknown. Hence, Patanjali’s first sutra: <em>Now the discipline of
Yoga.</em></p><p>The second question:</p><p>Osho,</p><p>It is said that Yoga is an atheistic system. Do you agree with
this?</p><p>Again, Yoga is neither. It is a simple science. It is neither
theistic nor atheistic. Patanjali really is superb, a miracle of a man.
He never talks about God. And even if he mentions God once, then too he
says it is just one of the methods of reaching the ultimate. The belief
in God is just a method to reach the ultimate – there is no God. To
believe in God is just a technique, because through believing in God
prayerfulness becomes possible; through believing in God surrender
becomes possible. The significance is of surrender and prayerfulness,
not of God.</p><p>Patanjali is really unbelievable! He said God – the belief in God,
the concept of God – is also one of the methods among many methods to
reach the truth. <em>Ishwara pranidhan</em> – to believe in God is just
a path. But it is not a necessity. You can choose something else. Buddha
reaches to that ultimate reality without believing in God. He chooses a
different path where God is not needed.</p><p>You have come to my house, you have passed through a certain street,
but that street was not the goal, it was just instrumental. You could
have reached to the same house through some other street; others have
reached through other streets. On your street there may be green trees,
big trees, on other streets there may not be. So God is just one path.
Remember the distinction: God is not the goal. God is just one of the
paths.</p><p>Patanjali never denies, he never assumes. He is absolutely
scientific. It is difficult for Christians to understand how Buddha
could attain the ultimate truth, because he never believed in God. It is
difficult for Hindus to understand how Mahavira could attain liberation,
because he never believed in God.</p><p>Before the Western thinkers became alert about Eastern religions they
always defined religion as God-centered. When they came upon Eastern
thinking and they became aware that there has been a traditional path, a
godless path reaching toward truth, they were shocked: “It is
impossible!”</p><p>H. G. Wells has written about Buddha that Buddha is the most godless
man and yet the most godly. He never believed and he will never tell
anybody to believe in any God, but he himself is the suprememost
phenomenon of the happening of divine being. Mahavira too travels a path
where God is not needed.</p><p>Patanjali is absolutely scientific: he says we are not related with
means, there are a thousand and one means – the goal is the truth. Some
have achieved it through God, so it is okay – believe in God and achieve
the goal, because when the goal is achieved you will throw away your
belief. So belief is just instrumental. If you don’t believe it is okay,
don’t believe, and travel the path of belieflessness and reach the
goal.</p><p>He is neither theist nor atheist. He is not creating a religion, he
is simply</p><p>showing you all the paths that are possible and all the laws that
work in your transformation. God is one of those paths, it is not a
must. If you are godless there is no need to be non-religious. Patanjali
says you can also reach, so be godless, don’t bother about God. These
are the laws and these are the experiments; this is the meditation –
pass through it.</p><p>He does not insist on any concept. It was very difficult. That’s why
the <em>Yoga Sutras</em> of Patanjali are rare, unique. Such a book has
never happened before and there is no possibility of its happening
again, because whatsoever can be written about Yoga he has written, he
has left nothing out. No one can add anything to it. Never in the future
is there any possibility to create another work like Patanjali’s
<em>Yoga Sutras</em>. He has finished the job completely, and he could
do this so totally because he is not partial. If he were partial then he
could not do it so totally.</p><p>Buddha is partial, Mahavira is partial, Jesus is partial, Mohammed is
partial – they have a certain path. And their partiality may be because
of you, because of a deep compassion for you. They insist on a certain
path, they go on insisting their whole life. And they say, “Everything
else is wrong, this is the right path,” just to create faith in you. You
are so faithless; you are so filled with doubt that if they say, “This
path leads, others’ paths also lead,” you will not follow any. They
insist that only <em>this</em> path leads.</p><p>This is not true. This is just a device for you because if you feel
any uncertainty in them, if they say, “This also leads, that also leads;
this is also true, that is also true,” you will become uncertain. You
are already uncertain. You need someone who is absolutely certain. Just
to look certain to you they have pretended to be partial.</p><p>But if you are partial you cannot cover the whole ground. Patanjali
is not partial. He is less concerned with you, more concerned with the
past designs of the path. He will not use a lie; he will not use a
device, he will not compromise with you. No scientist can
compromise.</p><p>Buddha can compromise. He has compassion, he is not treating you
scientifically. A very deep human feeling is there for you; he can even
lie just to help you. You cannot understand the truth so he compromises
with you.</p><p>Patanjali will not compromise with you. Whatsoever is the fact, he
will talk about the fact. And he will not descend a single step to meet
you, he is absolutely uncompromising. Science has to be. Science cannot
compromise; otherwise it will itself become a religion. He is neither
atheist nor theist. He is neither Hindu nor Mohammedan nor Christian nor
Jaina nor Buddhist. He is absolutely a scientific seeker just revealing
whatsoever is the case, revealing without any myth. He will not use a
single parable. Jesus will talk in stories</p><p>because you are children and you can only understand stories. He will
talk in parables. Buddha uses many stories just to help you to attain a
little glimpse.</p><p><br></p><p>I was reading about a Hassid, a Jewish master, Baal Shem. He was a
rabbi in a small village, and whenever there was some trouble, some
disease, some calamity in the village, he would move into the forest. He
would go to a certain spot under a certain tree and there he would do
some ritual and then he would pray to God. And it always happened that
the calamity would leave the village, the illness would disappear from
the village, the trouble would go.</p><p>Then Baal Shem died. His successor came. Then a problem arose again,
the village was in trouble. There was some calamity and the villagers
asked the successor, the new rabbi, to go to the forest and pray to God.
The new rabbi was very much disturbed because he was unacquainted with
the spot, the exact tree. But still he went, stopped under any tree. He
burned the fire, did the ritual and prayed and said to God, “Look, I
don’t know the exact spot my master used to come to, but you know. You
are omnipotent, you are omnipresent, so you know, so there is no need to
seek for the exact spot. My village is in some trouble, so listen and do
something.” The calamity was gone.</p><p>Then when this rabbi died and his successor was there, again the
problem came. The village was in a certain crisis and they came to him.
The rabbi was disturbed, he had even forgotten the prayer. So he went
into the forest, chose any place. He didn’t know how to burn the ritual
fire but anyhow he burned a fire and said to God, “Listen, I don’t know
how to burn the ritual fire, I don’t know the exact spot and I have
forgotten the prayer. But you are all-knowing so you know already; there
is no need for me to know. So do whatsoever is needed.” And he came back
and the village passed through the crisis.</p><p>Then he also died. Again the successor… And again the village was in
trouble, so they came. He was sitting in his armchair. He said to God,
“I don’t want to go anywhere. Listen, you are everywhere. I don’t know
the prayer, I don’t know any ritual. But that doesn’t matter; my knowing
is not the point. You know everything. What is the use of praying and
what is the use of a ritual and what is the use of a particular sacred
spot? I know only the story of my successors. I will tell you the story
that happened in Baal Shem’s time, then his successor, then his
successor: this is the story. Now do the right thing and this is
enough.” And the calamity disappeared. It is said that God loved the
story so much.</p><p>People love their stories, and the people’s God also loves stories,
and through stories you can have certain glimpses. But Patanjali will
not use a</p><p>single parable. I told you he is just Einstein plus Buddha, a very
rare combination. He has the inner witnessing of Buddha and the
mechanism of mind of an Einstein, but he is neither.</p><p>Theism is a story, atheism is the anti-story. They are just myths,
man-created parables. To some the one appeals, to some the other.
Patanjali is not interested in stories or myths, he is interested in the
naked truth. He will not even clothe it, he will not put on any
dressing, he will not decorate it. That is not his way, remember
this.</p><p>We will move on a very dry land, a desert-like land. But the desert
has its own beauty. It has no trees, it has no rivers, but it has a
vastness of its own. No forest can be compared to it. Forests have their
own beauty, hills have their own beauty, rivers their own beauty. The
desert has its own vast infinity.</p><p>We will be moving through desert-land. Courage is needed. He will not
give you a single tree to rest under. He will not give you any story,
just the bare facts. He will not use even a single superfluous word;
hence the word <em>sutra</em>. <em>Sutra</em> means the basic
minimum.</p><p>A sutra is not even a complete sentence. It is just the essential,
just as when you write a telegram you cut out superfluous words. Then it
becomes a sutra because only ten words or nine words can be put in it.
If you were going to write a letter you would fill ten pages, and even
in ten pages the message would not be complete. But in a telegram in ten
words it is not only complete, it is more than complete. It hits the
heart, the very essence is there.</p><p>Patanjali’s sutras are telegrams. He is a miser, he will not use a
single superfluous word. So how can he tell stories? – he cannot. And
don’t expect it. So don’t ask whether he is a theist or an atheist;
those are stories.</p><p>Philosophers have created many stories, and it is a game. If you like
the game of atheism, be an atheist. If you like the game of theism, be a
theist. But these are games, not the reality. Reality is something else.
Reality is concerned with you, not what you believe. The reality
<em>is</em> you, not what you believe. The reality is behind the mind,
not in the contents of the mind. Because theism is a content of the
mind, atheism is a content of the mind, something in the mind. Hinduism
is a content of the mind or Christianity is a content of the mind.</p><p>Patanjali is concerned with the beyond, not with the content. He
says, “Throw out this whole mind. Whatsoever it contains, it is
useless.” You may be carrying beautiful philosophies; Patanjali will
say, “Throw them out! All is rubbish.” It is difficult. If someone says,
“Your Bible is rubbish, your Gita is rubbish, your scriptures are
rubbish, rot, throw them away,” you will be shocked. But this is how it
is going to happen. Patanjali cannot make any compromise with you. He is
uncompromising and that’s the beauty. And that is</p><p>his uniqueness.</p><p><br></p><p>The third question:</p><p>Osho,</p><p>You talked about the significance of discipleship on the path of
Yoga, but how can an atheist be a disciple?</p><p>Neither a theist nor an atheist can be a disciple. They have already
taken an attitude, they have already decided, so what is the point of
being a disciple? If you already know how can you be a disciple?
Discipleship means the realization that, “I don’t know.” Atheists,
theists – no, they cannot be disciples.</p><p>And if you believe in something you will miss the beauty of
disciplehood. If you know something already, that knowing will give you
ego; it will not make you humble. That’s why pundits and scholars miss.
Sometimes sinners have reached, but scholars never. They know too much,
they are so clever. Their cleverness is the disease that becomes their
suicide. They won’t listen because they are not ready to learn.</p><p>Disciplehood simply means an attitude to learn, a moment-to-moment
remaining aware that “I don’t know.” This knowing that “I don’t know,”
this awareness that “I am ignorant” gives you opening. Then you are not
closed. The moment you say “I know” you are a closed circle; the door is
no longer open. But when you say “I don’t know” it means you are ready
to learn, the door is open.</p><p>If you have already reached, concluded, you cannot be a disciple. One
has to be in a receptive mood. One has to be completely aware that the
real is unknown, “And whatsoever I know is trivial, is just rubbish.”
What do you know? You may have gathered much information but that is not
knowledge. You may have accumulated much dust through universities; that
is not knowledge. You may know about Buddha, you may know about Jesus,
but that is not knowledge. Unless you become a Buddha there is no
knowledge. Unless you are a Jesus there is no knowledge.</p><p>Knowledge comes through being, not through memory. You can have a
trained memory; memory is just a mechanism. It will not give you a
richer being. It may give you nightmarish dreams but it will not give
you a richer being. You will remain the same, covered with much dust.
Knowledge, and particularly the ego that comes through knowledge – the
feeling that “I know” – closes you. Now you cannot be a disciple. And if
you cannot be a disciple you cannot enter the discipline of Yoga. So
come to the door of Yoga ignorant, aware of your ignorance, alert that
you don’t know. And I will tell you: this is</p><p>the only knowledge which will help, the knowledge that “I don’t
know.”</p><p>This will make you humble. A subtle humility will come to you. The
ego, by and by, will subside. Knowing that you don’t know, how can you
be egoistic? Knowledge is the most subtle food for the ego: you feel you
are something. You know, therefore you become somebody.</p><p>Just two days ago I initiated a girl from the West into sannyas and I
gave her a name, Yoga Sambodhi, and I asked her, “Will it be easy for
you to pronounce?” She said, “Yes. It looks just like the English word
<em>somebody</em>.” But <em>sambodhi</em> is quite the opposite. When
you become nobody, then <em>sambodhi</em> happens. <em>Sambodhi</em>
means enlightenment. If you are somebody, <em>sambodhi</em> will never
happen. That “somebodiness” is the barrier.</p><p>When you feel you are nobody, when you feel you are nothing, suddenly
you are available for many mysteries to happen to you. Your doors are
open. The sun can rise, the sunrays can penetrate you. Your gloom, your
darkness, will disappear. But you are closed. The sun may be knocking on
the door but there is no opening, not even a window is open.</p><p>Atheists or theists, Hindus or Mohammedans, Christians or Buddhists,
cannot enter on the path. They believe they have already reached Buddha
without reaching anywhere. They have concluded without any realization.
They have words in the mind, concepts, theories, scriptures – and the
more the burden, the more dead they are.</p><p><br></p><p>The fourth question:</p><p>Osho,</p><p>You said that Yoga does not ask for any faith. But if a disciple
needs faith, surrender and trust in the master as a basic condition,
then how is the first statement valid?</p><p>I did not say that Yoga doesn’t ask for faith. I said Yoga doesn’t
ask for any <em>belief</em>. Faith is totally different, trust is
totally different. Belief is an intellectual thing, but faith is a very
deep intimacy, it is not intellectual. You love a master, then you trust
and there is faith. But this faith is not in any concept, it is in the
very person. And this is not a condition, it is not required. Remember
this distinction: it is not required that you must have faith in the
master, it is not a precondition. All that is said is this: if trust
happens between you and the master, then <em>satsang</em> will be
possible. It is just a situation, not a condition. Nothing is
required.</p><p>Just as with love: if love happens then marriage can follow, but you
cannot make love a condition that first you must love and then marriage
will follow. But then you will ask, “How can one love?” If it happens it
happens, if it is not</p><p>happening it is not happening. You cannot do anything. So you cannot
force trust.</p><p>In the old days seekers would roam all over the world. They would
roam from one master to another, just waiting for the phenomenon to
happen. You cannot force it. You may pass through many masters just in a
search to see if somewhere something clicks. Then the thing has
happened; it is not a condition. You cannot go to a master and try to
trust him. How can you try to trust? The very trying, the very effort
shows you don’t trust. How can you try to love someone? If you try, the
whole thing has become false. It is a happening.</p><p>But unless this happens, <em>satsang</em> will not be possible. Then
the master cannot give his grace to you. Not that he will prevent
himself from giving; you are not available. He cannot do anything, you
are not open.</p><p>The sun may be waiting near the window but if it is closed, what can
the sun do? The rays will reflect back. They will come, knock on the
door, and go back. Remember, it is not a condition that you open the
door and the sun will rise, it is not a condition! The sun may not be
there, it may be night. Just by opening your door you cannot create the
sun. Your opening of the door is just your being available: if the sun
is there it can enter.</p><p>So seekers will move, will have to move from one master to another.
The only thing to remember is that they must remain open and they should
not judge. If you come near a master and you don’t feel any tuning with
him, move, but don’t judge, because your judgment will be wrong. You
have never been in contact. Unless you love you don’t know, so don’t
judge. Simply say, “This master is not for me, I am not for this master.
The thing has not happened.” You simply move.</p><p>If you start judging then you are closing yourself for other masters
also. You may have to pass through many, many situations, but remember
this: don’t judge. Whenever you feel that something is wrong with the
master, move on. That means you cannot trust. Something has gone wrong,
you cannot trust. But don’t say the master is wrong, because you don’t
know! You simply move on, that’s enough. You seek somewhere else.</p><p>If you start judging, condemning, concluding, then you will be
closed. And the eyes which judge will never be able to trust. Once you
have become a victim of judgment you will never be able to trust because
you will find something or other which will help you not to trust, which
will give you a closing.</p><p>So don’t trust, don’t judge, move on. Someday, if you go on moving,
the thing is bound to happen. Someday, somewhere, in some moment –
because</p><p>there are moments; you cannot do anything about them. When you are
vulnerable and when the master is flowing you meet. In a certain point
of time and space, the meeting happens. Then <em>satsang</em> becomes
possible.</p><p>Satsang <span class=p>means to be in close proximity with a master,
with a man who has known, because then he can flow. He is already
flowing. Sufis say that that’s enough; just to be in close proximity to
a master is enough. Just to sit near him, just to walk by his side, just
to sit outside his room, just to watch in the night sitting outside his
wall, just to go on remembering, that is enough.</span></p><p>But it takes years, many years of waiting. And he will not treat you
well, remember – he will create every type of hindrance. He will give
you many chances to judge. He will spread rumors about himself so you
can think that he is wrong and you can escape. He will help you in every
way to escape. Unless you pass all these necessary hurdles, and they are
necessary because a cheap trust is of no use – it needs a seasoned trust
which has waited long and has become a strong rock – only then can the
deepest layers be penetrated.</p><p>Patanjali doesn’t say that you will have to believe. Belief is
intellectual. You believe in Hinduism, it is not your trust. It is just
that accidentally you were born in a Hindu family. And so you have
heard; from the very childhood you have been impregnated. You have been
impressed with theories, concepts, philosophies, systems. They have
become part of your blood. They have just fallen into your unconscious,
you believe in them. But that belief is of no use because it has not
transformed you, it is a dead thing, borrowed.</p><p>Trust is never a dead thing. You cannot borrow trust from your
family; it is a personal phenomenon. <em>You</em> will have to come to
it. Hinduism is traditional, Mohammedanism is traditional.</p><p>That’s why the <em>sangham,</em> the first group around Mohammed,
were the real Mohammedans because it was a trust for them; they had come
personally to the master. They had lived with the master in close
proximity, they had <em>satsang</em>. They believed in Mohammed, and
Mohammed is not a man to be easily trusted – difficult. If you had been
to Mohammed you would have had to resist him, it was impossible to
believe in such a man. He had nine wives. He had a sword in his hand and
on his sword was written, “Peace is the motto”; the word <em>islam</em>
means peace. How can you believe this man?</p><p>You can believe in a Mahavira when he says, “Nonviolence”; he
<em>is</em> nonviolent. Obviously, you can believe in Mahavira. How can
you believe in Mohammed with a sword? And he says, “Love is the message
and peace is the motto.” You cannot believe. This man is creating
hurdles.</p><p>He was a Sufi; he was a master. He would create every difficulty. So
if your mind still functioned, you doubted, you were skeptical, you
could escape. But</p><p>if you remained, waited, if you had patience – and infinite patience
would have been needed – someday you would come to know Mohammed, you
would become a Mohammedan. Just by knowing him you would become a
Mohammedan.</p><p>The first group of disciples was a totally different thing. The first
group of disciples of Buddha was a totally different thing. Now
Buddhists are dead, Mohammedans are dead. They are traditionally
Mohammedans.</p><p>Truth cannot be transferred like property. Your parents cannot give
you truth. They can give you property because the property belongs to
the world. Truth doesn’t belong to the world, they cannot give it to
you; they cannot have it as a treasure. They cannot have it in the bank
so that it can be transferred to you. You will have to seek on your own.
You will have to suffer and you will have to become a disciple and you
will have to pass through rigorous discipline. It will be a personal
happening. Truth is always personal: it <em>happens</em> to a person.
Trust is different, belief is different. Belief is given by others,
trust is earned by you.</p><p>Patanjali doesn’t require any belief. But without trust nothing can
be done, without trust nothing is possible. But you cannot force it.
Understand, you cannot force your trust; it is not in your hands to
force it. If you force, it will be false, and no trust is better than a
false trust, because you are wasting yourself. It is better to move
somewhere else where the real can happen.</p><p>Don’t judge, go on moving: someday, somewhere, your master is
waiting. And the master cannot be shown to you – “Go here and this will
be your master.” You will have to seek, you will have to suffer, because
through suffering and seeking you will be able to see him. Your eyes
will become clear. The tears will disappear, your eyes will be unclouded
and you will realize that this is the master.</p><p>It is reported that one of the Sufis named Junnaid went to an old
fakir and said to him, “I have heard that you know. Show me the
path.”</p><p>The old man said, “You have <em>heard</em> that I know. <em>You</em>
don’t know. Look at me and feel.”</p><p>The man said, “I cannot feel anything. Just do one thing, just show
me the path where I can find my master.”</p><p>So the old man said, “Go first to Mecca. Do the pilgrimage and search
for such and such a man. He will be sitting under a tree. His eyes will
be such, they will be throwing light, and you will feel a certain
perfume like musk around him. Go and seek.”</p><p>And Junnaid traveled and traveled for twenty years. Wherever he
heard</p><p>there was a master, he would go. But neither was the tree there, nor
the perfume, the musk, nor those eyes the old man has described. The
personality was not there. And he had a ready-made formula, so he would
judge immediately, “This is not my master,” and he would move on. After
twenty years he reached under a tree – the master was there. The musk
was floating in the air just like a haze around the man. The eyes were
fiery, a red light was flowing. This was the man! He fell at his feet
and said, “Master, I have been searching for you for twenty years.”</p><p>The master said, “I have also been waiting for you for twenty years.
Look again.”</p><p>He looked, and saw that this was the same man who twenty years before
had told him the way to find the master. Junnaid started weeping. He
said, “What? You played a joke on me? Twenty years wasted! Why couldn’t
you have said that you are my master?”</p><p>The old man said, “That would not have helped. That would not have
been of any use because you did not have eyes to see. These twenty years
helped <em>you</em> to see me. I am the same man, but twenty years ago
you told me ‘I don’t feel anything.’ I am the same, but now you have
become capable to feel. You have changed. These twenty years rubbed you
hard – all the dust has fallen, your mind is clear. This fragrance of
musk was also there that time but you were not capable of smelling it.
Your nose was closed, your eyes were not functioning, and your heart was
not really beating so contact was not possible.”</p><p><br></p><p>You don’t know, and nobody can say where the trust will happen. I
don’t say trust the master. I simply say find the person where trust
happens – that person is your master. And you cannot do anything about
it. You will have to wander. The thing is certain to happen, but the
seeking is necessary because seeking prepares you. Not that the seeking
leads you to the master: seeking prepares you so that you can see. He
may be just near you…</p><p><br></p><p>The fifth question:</p><p>Osho,</p><p>Last night you spoke of satsang and the importance of the disciple’s
proximity to the guru. Does this mean physical proximity? Is the
disciple who lives at a great physical distance from the guru at a
loss?</p><p>Yes and no. Yes, a physical closeness is necessary in the beginning
because as you are, you cannot understand anything else right now. You
can understand the body, you can understand the language of the
physical. You exist at the</p><p>physical, so yes, a physical closeness is necessary in the
beginning.</p><p>And I also say no, because as you grow, as you start learning a
different language which is of the non-physical, then physical closeness
is not necessary. Then you can go anywhere. Then space doesn’t make any
difference, you remain in contact. Not only space, but time also doesn’t
make any difference. A master may be dead, you remain in contact. He may
have dropped his physical body, you remain in contact. If a trust
happens, then both time and space are transcended.</p><p>Trust is the miracle. You can be in closeness with Mohammed or Jesus
or Buddha right now if trust is there. But it is difficult because you
don’t know how. You cannot trust a living person, how can you trust a
dead one? But if trust happens, then you are close to Buddha right now.
And for persons who have faith, Buddha is alive. No master ever dies for
those who can trust. He goes on helping, he is always there. But for
you, even if Buddha is there physically standing behind you or in front
of you, just sitting by your side, you are not close to him. There may
be vast space between you. Love, trust, faith destroy both space and
time.</p><p>In the beginning, because you cannot understand any other language,
you can understand only the language of the physical, physical closeness
is necessary – but only in the beginning. A moment will come when the
master himself will send you away. He will force you to go away because
that too becomes necessary or you may start clinging to the physical
language.</p><p>All of his life, Gurdjieff nearly always sent his disciples away. He
would create such a miserable situation for them that they would have to
leave. It would be impossible to live with him. After a certain point he
would help them to go away. He would really force them to go away,
because one should not become too much dependent on the physical. The
other, the higher language, must develop. You must start feeling close
to him wherever you are, because the body has to be transcended. Not
only your body, but the master’s body also has to be transcended.</p><p>But in the beginning physical closeness is a great help. Once the
seeds are sown, once they have taken root, then you are strong enough.
Then you can go away and still you can feel. If just by going away the
contact is lost, then the contact is not of much importance. Trust will
grow more the further away you go. Trust will grow more, because
wherever you are on the earth you will start feeling the master’s
presence continuously. The trust will grow. He will be helping you now
through hidden hands, invisible hands. He will be working on you through
your dreams and you will feel that constantly, like a shadow, he is
following you.</p><p>But that is a very developed language. Don’t try it from the very
beginning because then you can deceive yourself. So I will say, move
step by step. Wherever trust happens, then close your eyes and follow
blindly. Really, the moment trust happens you have closed your eyes.
Then what is the use of thinking, arguing? Trust has happened and trust
will not listen to anything now. Then follow, and remain close unless
the master himself sends you away. And when he sends you away then don’t
cling. Then follow his instruction and go away, because he knows better.
And he knows what is helpful.</p><p>Sometimes just being near the master may make it difficult for you to
grow, just as under a big tree a new seed will have many difficulties to
grow. Under a big tree a new tree will become crippled. Even trees take
care to throw their seed far away so that the seeds can sprout. The
trees use many tricks to send the seed away. Otherwise they will die if
they fall down just under the big tree; there is so much shadow, no sun
reaches there, no sunrays reach.</p><p>So a master knows better. If he feels that you should go away, then
don’t resist. Then simply follow and go away. This going away will be a
coming nearer to him. If you can follow, if you can silently follow
without any resistance, then this going away will be a coming nearer.
You will attain a new closeness.</p><p><br></p><p>The sixth question:</p><p>Osho,</p><p>When you ask us to understand something clearly, whom do you address
to understand? Mind has to cease. Therefore, it is no use trying to make
the mind understand anything. Who should understand then?</p><p>Yes, mind has to cease, but it has not ceased yet. Mind has to be
worked on. An understanding has to be created in the mind: through that
understanding this mind will die. That understanding is just like
poison: you take the poison – you are the taker and the poison kills
you. The mind understands, but the understanding is poison for the mind.
That’s why the mind resists so much. It tries and tries not to
understand, it creates doubt, it fights. In every way it protects itself
because understanding is poison for the mind. It is elixir for you, but
for the mind it is poison.</p><p>So when I say understand clearly, I mean your mind, not you, because
<em>you</em> need not have any understanding, you are already
understanding. You are the very wisdom, the <em>pragnya</em>. You need
no help from me or from anybody else.</p><p>Your mind has to be changed. And if understanding happens to the
mind, mind will die, and with the mind the understanding will disappear.
Then you</p><p>will be in your purity; your being will reveal a mirror-like purity –
no content, contentless. But that inner being needs no understanding; it
is already the very core of understanding. It needs no understanding,
just the clouds of the mind have to be persuaded.</p><p>Really, understanding is just a persuasion for the mind to leave.
Remember, I don’t say fight, I say persuasion. If you fight, the mind
will never leave because through fight you show your fear. If you fight
you show that the mind is something you are afraid of. Just persuade.
All these teachings, all meditations are a deep persuasion for the mind
to come to a point where it can commit suicide, where it simply drops,
where mind itself becomes such an absurdity that you cannot carry it
anymore – you simply drop it. It is better to say mind drops itself.</p><p>So when I say clear understanding, I am addressing your mind. And
there is no other way. Only your mind can be approached because
<em>you</em> are unavailable. You are so hidden deep inside, and just
the mind is at the door. The mind has to be persuaded to leave the door
and to leave the door open so you will become available.</p><p>I am addressing mind – your mind, not you. If mind drops there is no
need to address. I can sit in silence and you will understand; there is
no need to address. The mind needs words, the mind needs thoughts, the
mind needs something mental which can persuade it. When Buddha or
Patanjali or Krishna talk to you, they are addressing your mind.</p><p>A moment comes when mind simply becomes aware of the whole absurdity.
It is just like this: I see that you are pulling the strings of your
shoelaces, trying to pull yourself up by them, and I tell you, “What
nonsense you are doing! This is impossible. You cannot pull yourself up
just by your own shoelaces. It is simply impossible, it cannot happen.”
So I persuade you to think more about the whole thing: “This is absurd.
What are you doing?” And then you feel miserable because it is not
happening. So I go on telling you, insisting, hammering, and one day you
may become aware, “Yes, this is absurd. What am I doing?”</p><p>The whole effort of the mind is just like pulling yourself up by your
own shoelaces. Whatsoever you are doing is absurd. It can never lead you
anywhere other than to hell, than to misery. It has always led you to
misery, but you are still not aware. All this communication from me is
just to make your mind alert that the whole effort is absurd. Once you
come to feel that the whole effort is absurd, the effort disappears. It
is not that you will have to leave your shoelaces and you will have to
make some effort and it is going to be arduous: you will simply see the
fact and you will stop and you will laugh. If you drop your</p><p>shoelaces and simply stand and laugh, you have become enlightened.
This is going to be the case.</p><p>Through understanding the mind drops. Suddenly you become aware that
no one else was responsible for your misery, you were creating it;
continuously, moment to moment, you were the creator. And you were
creating the misery and then you were asking how to go beyond it, how to
not be miserable, how to achieve bliss, how to achieve <em>samadhi</em>.
And even as you are asking, you are creating. Even this asking, “How to
achieve <em>samadhi</em>?” is creating misery because then you say, “I
have been making so much effort and <em>samadhi</em> has not been
attained yet. I am doing everything that can be done and the
<em>samadhi</em> has not been attained yet. When will I become
enlightened?”</p><p>Now you create a new misery when you make enlightenment also an
object of desire, which is absurd. No desire will come to a fulfillment.
When you realize this, desires drop – you are enlightened. Desireless,
you are enlightened. With desires you go moving in a circle of
misery.</p><p><br></p><p>The last question:</p><p>Osho,</p><p>You said that Yoga is a science, a methodology for inner awakening.
But effort to be, to go nearer to no-mind, implies motivation and hope.
Even to undergo the process of inner transformation implies motivation.
Then how can one move on the path of Yoga without hope and motivation?
Does not waiting even imply motivation?</p><p>Yes, you cannot move on the path of Yoga with motivation, with
desire, with hope. Really, there is <em>no</em> movement on the path of
Yoga. When you come to understand that all desire is absurd, all desire
is misery, then there is nothing to do, because every doing will be a
new desire. There is nothing to do! You simply cannot do anything
because whatsoever you do will lead you into a new misery. Then you
don’t do. Desires have dropped, mind has ceased, and this is Yoga. You
have entered. This is not a movement, this is a stillness. Problems
arise because of language. When I say that you have entered, it appears
that you have moved. All movement ceases when desire ceases. You are in
Yoga: <em>Now the discipline of Yoga.</em></p><p>With motivation, in the name of Yoga you will again create other
miseries. Every day people come to me and they say: “I have been
practicing Yoga for thirty years, nothing has happened.” But who told
you that something is going to happen? You must be waiting for something
to happen, that’s why nothing has happened. Yoga says, don’t wait for
the future.</p><p>You meditate, but you meditate with the motive that through
meditation you will reach somewhere, some goal. You are missing the
point. Meditate and</p><p>enjoy it! There is no goal, there is no future, no further; there is
nothing ahead. Meditate, enjoy it without any motivation, and suddenly
the goal is there. Suddenly the clouds disappear because they were
created by your desire. Your motivation is the smoke which creates the
clouds, and they have disappeared. So play with the meditation; enjoy
it. Don’t make it a means. It is the end. This is the whole point to be
understood.</p><p>Don’t create new desires. Understand the very nature of desire – that
it is misery. Just try to understand the nature of desire and you will
come to know that it is misery. Then what is to be done? Nothing is to
be done! Becoming alert that desire is misery, desire drops: <em>Now the
discipline of Yoga</em>. You have entered the path.</p><p>And it depends on your intensity. If your realization that desire is
misery is so deep, so total, you have not only entered Yoga, you have
become a <em>siddha</em>. You have reached the goal. It will depend on
your intensity. If the intensity is total then you have reached the
goal. If your intensity is not so total you have entered the path.</p><p>Enough for today.</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part4>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

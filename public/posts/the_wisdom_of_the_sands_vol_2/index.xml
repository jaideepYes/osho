The Man with the Inexplicable Life

THERE WAS ONCE A MAN NAMED MOJUD. HE LIVED IN A TOWN WHERE HE HAD OBTAINED A POST AS A SMALL OFFICIAL, AND IT SEEMED LIKELY THAT HE WOULD END HIS DAYS AS INSPECTOR OF WEIGHTS AND MEASURES.
ONE DAY WHEN HE WAS WALKING THROUGH THE GARDENS OF AN ANCIENT BUILDING NEAR HIS HOME, KHIDR, THE MYSTERIOUS GUIDE OF THE SUFIS, APPEARED TO HIM, DRESSED IN SHIMMERING GREEN.</description>

‌CHAPTER 2
Drop Becoming! Being is Enough
3 March 1978 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
I KEEP FEELING THAT I WANT TO FIGHT YOU. THERE ARE MANY THINGS I WANT TO SCREAM ABOUT, AND THERE FEELS NO ROOM TO SCREAM. FOR EXAMPLE, THIS MORNING IN ANSWERING A QUESTION, YOU SAID WE ARE ALL INVOLVED IN CREATING A TRADITION HERE AND THAT IF ONE DOES NOT FULLY ACCEPT WHAT IS HAPPENING, ONE SHOULD GET OUT OF IT.</description>

‌CHAPTER 3
You are here to be yourself
4 March 1978 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
OSHO, WHY ARE SO MANY PEOPLE AGAINST YOU?
It is natural. It is not strange. If they were not against me it would be absolutely strange. They have been against people like me forever. They HAVE to be, it is inevitable.
Whatsoever I am doing here is very shattering to their minds.</description>

The Three Jewelled Rings

THERE WAS ONCE A VERY RICH MAN WHO HAD A SON. HE SAID TO HIM, “MY SON, HERE IS A JEWELLED RING. KEEP IT AS A SIGN THAT YOU ARE A SUCCESSOR OF MINE, AND PASS IT DOWN TO YOUR POSTERITY.

‌CHAPTER 5
Allow the Heart
6 March 1978 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
HOW BLIND I HAVE BEEN! THERE ARE SO MANY SIGNPOSTS I HAVE MISSED, AND NOW I AM WONDERING ABOUT THOSE WHO WROTE THE SIGNS. THESE DAYS I’M DISCOVERING SO MANY TRACES OF HOW REALITY TRULY IS THROUGH WORDS OF OTHERS AND ASK, “WHERE WERE THEY?” ESPECIALLY SOME OF THE ENGLISH POETS, SHAKESPEARE AND BOB DYLAN.</description>

‌CHAPTER 6
Jesus Christ, I Missed!
7 March 1978 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
IN REALITY THERE IS NO EGO, NO SELF, NO ATMAN. YOU SAY YOU ARE NOT A PERSON BUT A PRESENCE, THAT YOU ARE A MIRROR. WHEN IT IS CLOUDY OUTSIDE YOU ARE CLOUDY. YOU REFLECT WHATEVER IS.
YOU ALSO SAY EVERYONE IS UNIQUE. WHERE IS THE UNIQUENESS TO BE FOUND IN A MIRROR?</description>

The first question:
Question 1
AM I A RESTLESS, CONFUSED BUDDHA AND ONLY NEED TO ACCEPT RIGHT NOW THE PECULIAR NATURE OF MY BUDDHAHOOD, OR IS IT DIFFERENT FROM AND COMES AFTER ALL THIS STUFF HAPPENING NOW?
Sambuddha, you are a Buddha from the very beginning, as everybody else is. Buddhahood is the source and the goal.</description>

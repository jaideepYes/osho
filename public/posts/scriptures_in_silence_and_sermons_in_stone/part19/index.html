It is there in the deepest core of our being. Call it truth, God, bliss, beauty: all those thing indicate the same phenomenon. There is something eternal in our beings, something immortal, something divine.\nAll that we have to do is to go deep, dive deep, into our own being, and to see, realize, recognize. Hence the journey is not really a journey. we are not to go anywhere; we have simply to sit silently and be.\nNicole means victorious heart, the victory of the heart. And that is the only victory in life; everything else is futile. Let the heart be victorious, let love be victorious. Money is of no use; power, prestige all are of no use. One is, from the very beginning, to be aware of the phenomenon that love is the only treasure to be 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- sought.\nWe are all searching for the home. We are all missing something. We are not certain exactly what it is, but the feeling is there in everybody's inner being that something is missing. And we go on accumulating things -- money, power, prestige -- hoping that by gaining all these things that feeling will disappear, that gap will be filled, that emptiness will not be there any more, it won't hurt anymore. But nothing from the outside can ever fill the gap, because money cannot enter into your being, neither can power, nor prestige.\nNothing from the outside is of any help. Hence the more you have, the more the feeling becomes a constant haunting: in contrast you go on feeling it more and more.\nPoor people don't feel so much in need of spiritual growth. They look contented in a way, but their contentment is false; their contentment is exactly like that of the cow just munching the grass.\nIn India people feel very proud that they are contented: \"Look how poor we are and still we are contented.\" This is not contentment. You can't feel your inner poverty because there is nothing to contrast to it. It is like writing with white chalk on a white wall: you can't see it. Write on a blackboard, then you will be able to see it and read it. Hence the richer one grows, the poorer one feels. A strange paradox starts happening: the richer a society is, the more searching there is for a home, the more searching there is for roots. It is not an accident that only affluent societies become religious. Poor societies only pretend; poor societies cannot be religious. They are not even materialists -- how can they be spiritualists?\nSpritualism can only be a higher stage of materialism, there is no other way. But the search is there: the poor searches through money, a good house, family, this and that -- but by the time you have arranged all these things suddenly you become aware that life is gone and you are exactly where you have always been: as empty as ever, as hollow as ever. Then a great frustration sets in. You have missed life. Nothing from the outside can ever fulfill the search. But I am not against the outside, I am all for it, for the simple reason that when you have all\non the outside your search for the inner becomes acute. Ava.\nLife is synonymous with God. God is not the creator of life, but life itself; he is not separate from life.\nThe very idea of the creator is false. He is not like a painter, because the painter becomes separate from the painting. He is more like a dancer: he remains one with it.\nHence to worship God, one need not go to a temple, to a mosque, to a synagogue. Life is more than is needed. This whole earth, this whole existence, is full of God, overflooded with God. He is the green and the red and the gold of the trees. He is all over the place; you cannot avoid him. We collide with him every moment. It is just because we have some idea of God we go on missing him. We have some idea that he is somewhere far away in heaven: hence we go on missing him. Drop that stupid idea and you will find him everywhere. He is very close by.\nOnce Ramakrishna was asked, \"Where is God?\" And he said \"You tell me where he is not. I have been searching for the place where he is not and I have failed: I have not yet found a place where he is not.\"\nFrancesca\nTo be totally free one needs to be totally aware, because our bondage is rooted in our unconsciousness; it does not come from the outside. Nobody can make you unfree. You can be destroyed but your freedom cannot be taken away... unless you give it away. In the ultimate analysis it is always your desire to be unfree that makes you unfree. It is your desire to be dependent, your desire to drop the responsibility of being yourself, that makes you unfree.\nThe moment one takes responsibility for oneself.… And remember it is not all roses, there are thorns in it; and it is not all sweet, there are many bitter moments in it. The sweet is always balanced by the bitter, they always come in the same proportion. The roses are balanced by the thorns, the days by the nights, the summer by the winters. Life keeps a balance between the polar opposites, so one who is ready to accept the responsibility of being oneself with all its beauties, bitternesses, its joys and agonies, can be free. Only he can be free...\nLive it in all its agony and all its ecstasy -- both are yours. And always remember: ecstasy cannot live without exist without death, and joy cannot exist without sadness. That's how things are -- nothing can be done about it. That's the very nature, the very tao of things.\nAccept the responsibility of being yourself as you are, with all that is good and with all that is bad, with all that is beautiful and that which is not beautiful. In that acceptance a transcendence happens and one becomes free.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nFreedom means transcendence, going above the duality. Then you are neither ecstasy or agony; you are just a witness to all that happens to you. That transcendence is real freedom and that makes one enlightened, liberated.\nAndrew is the first disciple of Jesus, the first initiate, the first man called by Jesus to become his disciple... And you look as if you have just walked out of the New Testament!\nThe greatest courage in the world is to not imitate others, to live one's own life as authentically as possible, whatsoever the cost. Even if life is lost in living your own life it is worth it, because that is how the soul is born. When one is ready to die for something, in that very agony -- the word \"agony\" comes from agon; it means struggle -- in that very struggle one is born. It is a birth pain. It takes courage, it takes guts.\nLive your life without being bothered by the moralists, puritans, priests, stupid people who go on advising. Live your life. Even if you live in error, then too it is better to live your own life than to be right according to somebody else, because the man who is right according to somebody else is false, and the man who is wrong according to his own decision is going to learn from his error sooner or later. He will grow out of it, he will be benefited by it.\nThe only person who learns is the person who is ready to commit errors, and the\nbest way to commit errors is not to listen to others -- just go on doing your thing!\nSandip means a lamp, a light. The last words of Buddha to his disciples were: Be a lamp unto thyself.\nPeople search in scriptures, but in vain; and people go searching for guides, but they will be disappointed because the real guide is within you, the real light is within you. Your own consciousness has to become a light unto itself.…\nNever be an imitator. Listen to the enlightened ones just to find your own light. Don't become a parrot, don't repeat them. That's what has been done down the ages by millions of people. They have become Christians, Mohammedans and Hindus and Buddhists, but they have not become enlightened. Their life goes on remaining in the same dark state, in the same hell.\nRemember it: I am here to help you to be yourself. I don't give you a character, I don't give you any discipline. I don't give you any clear-cut indications of what to do and what not to do. I only give you vague hints, indications, fingers pointing to the moon, the moon that is within you.\nPeggy means a child of light.\nWe are born of light, we live in light, we die in light -- we are made out of light. This has ben one of the greatest insights of the mystics of all the ages. The scientists have also agreed to it just now, within these twenty years; they had to agree. Just twenty years ago they were laughing at the mystics, thinking that they were talking nonsense. Man made of light? They must be talking metaphorically, not literally. But mystics were really talking literally.\nNow science not only says that man is made of light but that everything is made of light, all is made of electrons, electricity. Science has come to this understanding from a very very long route. The objective route is a very long route; the subjective route is very easy, the shortest possible, because you have only to look within. Nothing else is required: no lab, no instruments, no sophisticated devices, nothing else is required -- just the art of closing your eyes and looking in.\nAnd that's what meditation is: the art of looking in. The moment thoughts disappear and the mind is utterly quiet and silent, the inner light is seen. That is a revelation.\nAnd once you have seen your light, you will be surprised: you can see it now in everybody else. Then the whole existence is nothing but an ocean of light. It is not matter, it is pure energy.\nBarbara.\nBliss is a stranger in the world. People are well acquainted with misery, they live in it. Bliss is an absolute stranger to them.\nWhenever they see a blissful person they think he must have gone mad, because all sane people are miserable. Only once in a while do you see an insane person really enjoying himself. Or, once in a while there is a Buddha, a Christ; they are also thought by the so-called wise people, the worldly-wise, to be mad.\nThere are still people who go on writing books on Jesus calling him neurotic. Buddha was thought to be a madman in his own day for the simple reason that he was so blissful.\nPeople can understand misery -- that is their language. Bliss is not their language. But I teach you bliss, 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nin the eyes of the world I teach you madness. Even if the so-called worldly-wise are sometimes happy, their happiness is superficial. It is more or less a pretension, a deception, they are deceiving others and deceiving themselves; or maybe it is a strategy to hide their misery, to cover up their wounds.\nYou may have heard one of the very famous maxims of Murphy -- Murphy's principle. It says: Smile, because tomorrow is going to be worse! So even if people smile it is just in deep fear: they don't know what is going to happen tomorrow.\nFriedrich Nietzsche is reported to have said, \"I smile in order to hide my tears. I laugh only so that I may not start crying.\" This is a very ugly situation. What kind of sanity is this? What kind of health and wholeness? We have created a\nvery unwholesome society.\nMy sannyasins have to become the foundation of a new society, of a new man, who will live bliss as his life, whose goal will not be otherworldly, who will live the paradise here and now, who will transform this very moment into a sacred moment. And the miracle happens: whenever a person is really blissful he transforms the space that surrounds him into a sacred space. Then it is no longer ordinary.\nEntering into sannyas means entering into my space, becoming part of me. It is a merger, a melting, a meeting where boundaries disappear. And that's what love is. Sannyas is a love affair.\nArupa.\nRemember: we are not the body and we are not the mind either. The body has a gross form; the mind has s subtle form. But we are a formless witness -- just an infinite witness, and infinite mirror which reflects everything and which is never contaminated by anything that it reflects.\nThe mirror can reflect the beautiful flower, it does not become the beautiful flower. It can reflect something ugly, it does not become ugly. It remains unpolluted, it remains untouched. and that's how we are: we are pure consciousness, pure mirrors. But if we become identified with the body and the mind then misery arises, then clinging, then fear, then ultimately the fear of death.\nIf you are not identified with the body-mind complex there is no fear. And being without fear is freedom, to be free from fear is freedom. So this is going to be your meditation: become more and more aware that you are a formless consciousness, just a watcher -- never a doer, just a watcher.\nTo know oneself is to be victorious. Not to know oneself is to be a failure; then one may be an Alexander the Great, still one is a failure. In knowing oneself one may be absolutely anonymous, a beggar, and still one has conquered the world, because by knowing oneself one comes to know the very secret of life. In knowing oneself one comes to know not only oneself, one comes to know the very self of existence.\nAnd that knowing liberates -- liberates you from all fears, liberates you from all\nmiseries, liberates you from birth and death. It makes life abundant, available to you.\nJesus calls that life the kingdom of god. It is within you. No army is needed, you are not expected to conquer anybody. It is a very strange victory. It happens at the inner-most core of your being: no army, no enemy, no arms. And suddenly one is victorious, one has conquered life, because one has known life. To know is to conquer.\nScriptures in Silence and Sermons in Stones Chapter #20\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2612","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/scriptures_in_silence_and_sermons_in_stone/part19/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/scriptures_in_silence_and_sermons_in_stone/>Scriptures In Silence And Sermons In Stone</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>13 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2612 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Scriptures_In_Silence_And_Sermons_In_Stone/part19.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part18>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

by the thorns, the days by the nights, the summer by the winters. Life
keeps a balance between the polar opposites, so one who is ready to
accept the responsibility of being oneself with all its beauties,
bitternesses, its joys and agonies, can be free. Only he can be
free...</p><p>Live it in all its agony and all its ecstasy -- both are yours. And
always remember: ecstasy cannot live without exist without death, and
joy cannot exist without sadness. That's how things are -- nothing can
be done about it. That's the very nature, the very tao of things.</p><p>Accept the responsibility of being yourself as you are, with all that
is good and with all that is bad, with all that is beautiful and that
which is not beautiful. In that acceptance a transcendence happens and
one becomes free.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on

neither ecstasy or agony; you are just a witness to all that happens to
you. That transcendence is real freedom and that makes one enlightened,
liberated.</p><p>Andrew is the first disciple of Jesus, the first initiate, the first
man called by Jesus to become his disciple... And you look as if you
have just walked out of the New Testament!</p><p>The greatest courage in the world is to not imitate others, to live
one's own life as authentically as possible, whatsoever the cost. Even
if life is lost in living your own life it is worth it, because that is
how the soul is born. When one is ready to die for something, in that
very agony -- the word "agony" comes from agon; it means struggle -- in
that very struggle one is born. It is a birth pain. It takes courage, it
takes guts.</p><p>Live your life without being bothered by the moralists, puritans,
priests, stupid people who go on advising. Live your life. Even if you
live in error, then too it is better to live your own life than to be
right according to somebody else, because the man who is right according
to somebody else is false, and the man who is wrong according to his own
decision is going to learn from his error sooner or later. He will grow
out of it, he will be benefited by it.</p><p>The only person who learns is the person who is ready to commit
errors, and the</p><p>best way to commit errors is not to listen to others -- just go on
doing your thing!</p><p>Sandip means a lamp, a light. The last words of Buddha to his
disciples were: Be a lamp unto thyself.</p><p>People search in scriptures, but in vain; and people go searching for
guides, but they will be disappointed because the real guide is within
you, the real light is within you. Your own consciousness has to become
a light unto itself.…</p><p>Never be an imitator. Listen to the enlightened ones just to find
your own light. Don't become a parrot, don't repeat them. That's what
has been done down the ages by millions of people. They have become
Christians, Mohammedans and Hindus and Buddhists, but they have not
become enlightened. Their life goes on remaining in the same dark state,
in the same hell.</p><p>Remember it: I am here to help you to be yourself. I don't give you a
character, I don't give you any discipline. I don't give you any
clear-cut indications of what to do and what not to do. I only give you
vague hints, indications, fingers pointing to the moon, the moon that is
within you.</p><p>Peggy means a child of light.</p><p>We are born of light, we live in light, we die in light -- we are
made out of light. This has ben one of the greatest insights of the
mystics of all the ages. The scientists have also agreed to it just now,
within these twenty years; they had to agree. Just twenty years ago they
were laughing at the mystics, thinking that they were talking nonsense.
Man made of light? They must be talking metaphorically, not literally.
But mystics were really talking literally.</p><p>Now science not only says that man is made of light but that
everything is made of light, all is made of electrons, electricity.
Science has come to this understanding from a very very long route. The
objective route is a very long route; the subjective route is very easy,
the shortest possible, because you have only to look within. Nothing
else is required: no lab, no instruments, no sophisticated devices,
nothing else is required -- just the art of closing your eyes and
looking in.</p><p>And that's what meditation is: the art of looking in. The moment
thoughts disappear and the mind is utterly quiet and silent, the inner
light is seen. That is a revelation.</p><p>And once you have seen your light, you will be surprised: you can see
it now in everybody else. Then the whole existence is nothing but an
ocean of light. It is not matter, it is pure energy.</p><p>Barbara.</p><p>Bliss is a stranger in the world. People are well acquainted with
misery, they live in it. Bliss is an absolute stranger to them.</p><p>Whenever they see a blissful person they think he must have gone mad,
because all sane people are miserable. Only once in a while do you see
an insane person really enjoying himself. Or, once in a while there is a
Buddha, a Christ; they are also thought by the so-called wise people,
the worldly-wise, to be mad.</p><p>There are still people who go on writing books on Jesus calling him
neurotic. Buddha was thought to be a madman in his own day for the
simple reason that he was so blissful.</p><p>People can understand misery -- that is their language. Bliss is not
their language. But I teach you bliss, 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>in the eyes of the world I teach you madness. Even if the so-called
worldly-wise are sometimes happy, their happiness is superficial. It is
more or less a pretension, a deception, they are deceiving others and
deceiving themselves; or maybe it is a strategy to hide their misery, to
cover up their wounds.</p><p>You may have heard one of the very famous maxims of Murphy --
Murphy's principle. It says: Smile, because tomorrow is going to be
worse! So even if people smile it is just in deep fear: they don't know
what is going to happen tomorrow.</p><p>Friedrich Nietzsche is reported to have said, "I smile in order to
hide my tears. I laugh only so that I may not start crying." This is a
very ugly situation. What kind of sanity is this? What kind of health
and wholeness? We have created a</p><p>very unwholesome society.</p><p>My sannyasins have to become the foundation of a new society, of a
new man, who will live bliss as his life, whose goal will not be
otherworldly, who will live the paradise here and now, who will
transform this very moment into a sacred moment. And the miracle
happens: whenever a person is really blissful he transforms the space
that surrounds him into a sacred space. Then it is no longer
ordinary.</p><p>Entering into sannyas means entering into my space, becoming part of
me. It is a merger, a melting, a meeting where boundaries disappear. And
that's what love is. Sannyas is a love affair.</p><p>Arupa.</p><p>Remember: we are not the body and we are not the mind either. The
body has a gross form; the mind has s subtle form. But we are a formless
witness -- just an infinite witness, and infinite mirror which reflects
everything and which is never contaminated by anything that it
reflects.</p><p>The mirror can reflect the beautiful flower, it does not become the
beautiful flower. It can reflect something ugly, it does not become
ugly. It remains unpolluted, it remains untouched. and that's how we
are: we are pure consciousness, pure mirrors. But if we become
identified with the body and the mind then misery arises, then clinging,
then fear, then ultimately the fear of death.</p><p>If you are not identified with the body-mind complex there is no
fear. And being without fear is freedom, to be free from fear is
freedom. So this is going to be your meditation: become more and more
aware that you are a formless consciousness, just a watcher -- never a
doer, just a watcher.</p><p>To know oneself is to be victorious. Not to know oneself is to be a
failure; then one may be an Alexander the Great, still one is a failure.
In knowing oneself one may be absolutely anonymous, a beggar, and still
one has conquered the world, because by knowing oneself one comes to
know the very secret of life. In knowing oneself one comes to know not
only oneself, one comes to know the very self of existence.</p><p>And that knowing liberates -- liberates you from all fears, liberates
you from all</p><p>miseries, liberates you from birth and death. It makes life abundant,
available to you.</p><p>Jesus calls that life the kingdom of god. It is within you. No army
is needed, you are not expected to conquer anybody. It is a very strange
victory. It happens at the inner-most core of your being: no army, no
enemy, no arms. And suddenly one is victorious, one has conquered life,
because one has known life. To know is to conquer.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:justify id=scriptures-in-silence-and-sermons-in-stones>Scriptures in Silence

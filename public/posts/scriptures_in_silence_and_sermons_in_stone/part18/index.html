It is for reference purposes only.]\nPrem Vanilla. Prem means love. Vanilla is an orchard which brings fruits of great fragrance. Love is that orchard. Love is the fulfillment of man. It is only through love that man flowers and comes to great fragrance. I teach love -- that's the only religion. All other religions are just pseudo religions. The true religion can only be of love.\nHans.\nFeel blissful, because today you are becoming a beloved disciple. Feel blessed.\nTo be a sannyasin is a rare phenomenon because to seek God is rare, to seek truth is rare. People are concerned with the superficial, with the mundane, with the mediocre. To be a seeker of truth is the real beginning of life. Then life takes wings, one starts soaring higher. There are planes upon planes.\nMan is not meant to crawl and creep on the earth. He has the capacity to fly to the ultimate. And that is possible only when one becomes an initiate, a disciple. Disciple, the word \"disciple\" comes from a root which means readiness to learn,\nreadiness, receptivity, openness to learn. There is much to learn: the whole infinity. There is much to know: this tremendously beautiful existence. There is much to love and to live.\nOne should not be satisfied with the ordinary. That's what sannyas is all about: a deep, divine discontent with the ordinary.\nPeter.\nLove should be the rock of everybody's life, it should be the foundation. Without love your life is made without any foundation; it is bound to collapse. You are making sandcastles or you are making palaces of playing cards: just a little breeze and the whole palace will fall down. But if love is the foundation of a life that not even death can destroy, love opens the door to life eternal. The life of the soul is possible only through the life of love. Love is the bridge between the body and the soul, hence love has a paradoxical nature. On the one hand, if you look at it through the body it is sex; on the other hand, if you look at it through the soul it is prayer. But it is the same energy. Love functioning physiologically is sex and functioning spiritually is prayer.\nDeva Lucy.\nMan is a seed, but only a seed of great potential, but nothing is actual. The seed can die as a seed without ever becoming a tree, without ever coming to flowering. Man is the seed of light. But ordinarily man is not resplendent, man is not luminous, for the simple reason that the shell of the seed is hard and there 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nare no windows. Man remains enclosed in himself; hence the darkness on the faces of people, in the eyes of people. But if the shell can be broken -- and it can be -- then great light is released. It is an explosion! That explosion brings ecstasy. That explosion brings you to the eternal. That explosion makes you aware of your eternity, of your immortality, of your godliness.\nThere is no other way, except meditation, to break the seed. One has to go on hammering with meditation. One never knows how long it will take because each individual is different. And no individual is predictable, because people have lived different lives in their past and they have accumulated different personalities around themselves. A few people have very thin layers: just a little hit is enough, just the shadow of the whip is enough, not even the whip is needed. But a few people are really thick-skinned: unless you go on hammering, their inner light, their inner splendour, cannot be released. And one never knows how thick the layer is.\nOne thing is certain -- it may take a little longer time or a little less, that doesn't matter -- the shell of the seed can be broken, the breakthrough is possible. And that is the only hope for man, because only through that breakthrough do you become aware that god is. Then life has meaning, significance, beauty, benediction.\nErik has two meanings: one is Teutonic -- it means kingly, the other is Anglo- Saxon -- it means brave.\nBut both are part of one phenomenon: the courageous person, the brave person, is always kingly, and the kingly person cannot be other than brave.\nBliss is only for those who are really courageous. It needs the greatest courage in the world to be blissful. It is a paradox! bliss is a natural phenomenon; it should not need any courage, it should be very simple. It is not an achievement, it is our very being. But the society creates in us a pseudo personality which is against the natural, which is against the real. And the society's effort is great: through parental education, through the church through the state and through the schools, colleges, universities, one-third of a man's life, twenty-five years is devoted to creating a false self. It is because of that false self that great courage is needed to take the jump into the natural. Twenty-five years of wrong training, of wrong conditioning, create the problem. Every child is born blissful, but we drag him out of his nature; we make him miserable. And unless we succeed we don't rest.\nThe whole strategy of civilization is to create miserable people, and the way to create miserable people is to give them an ego. Then they will remain miserable for ever. The ego can never be satisfied, it is impossible to satisfy it. It goes on demanding more and more; hence it is always in misery. It always longs for the impossible, and when the impossible cannot happen there is great frustration,\nthere is hell.\nWe give the ego to each individual, and through the ego the society manipulates each individual, makes him so miserable that he remains a slave to the powers, to the establishment, to the church, to the state, to the politicians, to the priests. A miserable person cannot rebel, a miserable person clings to whatsoever he has. A miserable person is always a beggar, he cannot be a king, And he cannot risk. He cannot even risk his miseries because he is afraid: \"Who knows? -- I may get into deeper misery. At least this misery is well-known, I am acquainted with it. I have become adjusted to it, I can cope with it. Who knows about the new misery? It is better to remain confined to the old.\" The miserable person always remains orthodox; he never explores.\nAnd that's what the society wants: nobody should be an explorer and nobody should be an adventurous soul. Nobody should ask what is truth. Everybody should be a believer, not a seeker, not an enquirer.\nNobody should be a rebel, a revolutionary. everybody should be a slave, just a machine -- efficient, very efficient - from birth the death. All that society asks of you is efficiency.\nI have heard about an efficiency expert. He died and when he was being taken out of the hospital he asked, \"How many people are carrying me out?\" There was great panic, because he was dead. Somebody said \"Six.\" He said \"There is no need for six; you can put me on wheels. One is enough.\" And then he lay down and died again. Efficiency experts don't die.\nAll that this society requires from you from birth to death is: be efficient, be a good machine, not a man.\nAnd a machine cannot be blissful. If you are really a machine then you cannot be miserable either, but because man is not a machine and has to function as a machine, misery is created. If man were really a machine there would be no problem; no machine is miserable. But man is a consciousness and has to function as a machine. This is the misery -- the only misery the only hell.\nCourage is needed to go beyond the familiar, to go beyond the conditioning that the society has enforced on you, to go beyond that which has been taught to you, to go beyond Christianity, Hinduism, Buddhism, 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nMohammedanism, to go beyond all cultures, to go beyond all the past. That's exactly my work here: to help you to go beyond all conditionings.\nA sannyasin is a person who drops all conditionings and never substitutes any other conditioning again, who remains unconditioned and functions out of that unconditioned state of consciousness. Then action is tremendously beautiful, liberating, and then life becomes a poem, a painting, a work of art. Then it has value. How long will you be here?\n-- According to the conditioning, about three months.\n-- Be here three months -- three months will do!\nPeter is the name of one of the disciples of Jesus, one of the twelve disciples. Jesus called him Peter because he was the most determined disciple out of all of them; he called him Peter because he was like a rock. He said to him: You will be a rock for my work. You will become the foundation stone for the temple that I am raising. Love should be the rock of everybody's life, it should be the foundation. Without love your life is made without any foundation; it is bound to collapse. You are making sandcastles or you are making palaces of playing cards: just a little breeze and the whole palace will fall down. But if love is the foundation of a life that not even death can destroy, love opens the door to life eternal. The life of the soul is possible only through the life of love. Love is the bridge between the body and the soul, hence love has a paradoxical nature. On the one hand, if you look at it through the body it is sex; on the other hand, if you look at it through the soul it is prayer. But it is the same energy. Love functioning physiologically is sex and functioning spiritually is prayer. The work of a sannyasin consists in transforming sexual energy into prayer. That day is the greatest in your life when your sex is transformed into prayer, when your sex has no sexuality in it but becomes prayerful, when your sex does not drag you downwards, is no more part of the gravitational field, but starts helping you rise upwards.\nThere are two laws: one of gravitation, that which pulls you down; and the other\nof grace, that which pulls you up. Sex has to be transformed from gravitation to grace. This is real alchemy.\nMy sannyas is not a renunciation of life but a transformation. It is not an escape but a great adventure.\nSatyo.\nBliss is truth. Don't seek truth, seek bliss, and truth will find you of its own accord.\nThose who seek truth directly never find it. Their search becomes more and more intellectual and logical; it becomes intellectual gymnastics. That's how philosophy is born.\nSeek bliss. Then it is a totally different search. Then you will come across love, not across logic; then you will come across music, not mathematics; then you will be more close to poetry than to prose. Your dimension will start changing. You will be more and more celebrating, you will be more and more festive, less and less serious.\nLet cheerfulness be your only discipline. Then one day one is surprised: truth has knocked on one's door. when you are totally in bliss time ceases. when you are totally in bliss you disappear, you melt away --\nand that is the moment, the momentous moment, when truth enters. Call it God, nirvana, enlightenment, tao, or whatsoever name you choose: It has no name, it is a nameless experience. But it comes only to those who are dancing, singing, celebrating. It never comes to serious people. Seriousness is illness, it is pathological.\nBlissfulness is wholeness, health. Narayanyo\nYou are made of the stuff called God. Of course we are not aware of it but that does not make any difference: aware or unaware, awake or asleep, you are divine. and one who is asleep this moment can be awake the next.\nThe function of the master is to wake you up and the whole approach of a\ndisciple is to be ready to be awakened. In the beginning it is arduous because you are having beautiful dreams and the master goes on shaking and shocking you. It is cold and too early and you would like to sleep a little more. And you feel angry with the master many times because he goes on persisting: Wake up!\nTo be a disciple means that you will allow the master to force you, to wake you up; that the more he hammers you, the more grateful you will be. Of course once in a while you will feel angry but then you have to remember that by being a disciple you have chosen to be hit, to be hammered, to be dragged out of your sleep. All kinds of devices are bound to be used: cold water has to be thrown over you, your blankets have to be taken away. You have to be pulled and pushed, and all kinds of imaginable and unimaginable 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nthings have to be done to you. All that is implied in being a disciple. But if one cooperates with the master it can happen very easily. The difficulty becomes more and more complex because of resistance. Don't resist, cooperate, and something of immense value is possible... something for which you will remain eternally grateful.\nGeorge Gurdjieff remembers that when his grandmother was dying she called him to the side of her bed.\nHe was very young, just nine years old, and the very old woman whispered in the ears of this boy.… She had loved this boy more than anybody else. She said to him, 'I have a message for you -- remember it, never forget. It is a simple message, but if you can practise it, it will open the doors of great treasures for you. And the message is really simple.' She simply said, 'Remember this sentence 'Never do as others do,' and follow it.\" Whenever anybody asked Gurdjieff, 'How did you become enlightened? How did you become what you have become?\" he always said, 'The whole credit goes to my grandmother, because she said to me 'Never do as others do.' So I made it a point if others were going to the north I would go to the south, if others were standing on their feet I would stand on my head. Through following her advice I have attained whatsoever I have attained.'\nThe crowd consists of sleepwalkers. Be unique, be individual. That is the only way to be a sannyasin. So never do as others do -- that is the meaning of your name! How long will you be here?\n-- Two months.\n-- Good. Do a few groups, mm? And choose the groups which nobody else chooses!\nScriptures in Silence and Sermons in Stones Chapter #19\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2613","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/scriptures_in_silence_and_sermons_in_stone/part18/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/scriptures_in_silence_and_sermons_in_stone/>Scriptures In Silence And Sermons In Stone</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>13 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2613 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Scriptures_In_Silence_And_Sermons_In_Stone/part18.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part17>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

impossible to satisfy it. It goes on demanding more and more; hence it
is always in misery. It always longs for the impossible, and when the
impossible cannot happen there is great frustration,</p><p>there is hell.</p><p>We give the ego to each individual, and through the ego the society
manipulates each individual, makes him so miserable that he remains a
slave to the powers, to the establishment, to the church, to the state,
to the politicians, to the priests. A miserable person cannot rebel, a
miserable person clings to whatsoever he has. A miserable person is
always a beggar, he cannot be a king, And he cannot risk. He cannot even
risk his miseries because he is afraid: "Who knows? -- I may get into
deeper misery. At least this misery is well-known, I am acquainted with
it. I have become adjusted to it, I can cope with it. Who knows about
the new misery? It is better to remain confined to the old." The
miserable person always remains orthodox; he never explores.</p><p>And that's what the society wants: nobody should be an explorer and
nobody should be an adventurous soul. Nobody should ask what is truth.
Everybody should be a believer, not a seeker, not an enquirer.</p><p>Nobody should be a rebel, a revolutionary. everybody should be a
slave, just a machine -- efficient, very efficient - from birth the
death. All that society asks of you is efficiency.</p><p>I have heard about an efficiency expert. He died and when he was
being taken out of the hospital he asked, "How many people are carrying
me out?" There was great panic, because he was dead. Somebody said
"Six." He said "There is no need for six; you can put me on wheels. One
is enough." And then he lay down and died again. Efficiency experts
don't die.</p><p>All that this society requires from you from birth to death is: be
efficient, be a good machine, not a man.</p><p>And a machine cannot be blissful. If you are <em>really</em> a
machine then you cannot be miserable either, but because man is not a
machine and has to function as a machine, misery is created. If man were
really a machine there would be no problem; no machine is miserable. But
man is a consciousness and has to function as a machine. This is the
misery -- the only misery the only hell.</p><p>Courage is needed to go beyond the familiar, to go beyond the
conditioning that the society has enforced on you, to go beyond that
which has been taught to you, to go beyond Christianity, Hinduism,

That's exactly my work here: to help you to go beyond all
conditionings.</p><p>A sannyasin is a person who drops all conditionings and never
substitutes any other conditioning again, who remains unconditioned and
functions out of that unconditioned state of consciousness. Then action
is tremendously beautiful, liberating, and then life becomes a poem, a
painting, a work of art. Then it has value. How long will you be
here?</p><p>-- According to the conditioning, about three months.</p><p>-- Be here three months -- three months will do!</p><p>Peter is the name of one of the disciples of Jesus, one of the twelve
disciples. Jesus called him Peter because he was the most determined
disciple out of all of them; he called him Peter because he was like a
rock. He said to him: You will be a rock for my work. You will become
the foundation stone for the temple that I am raising. Love should be
the rock of <em>everybody's</em> life, it should be the foundation.
Without love your life is made without any foundation; it is bound to
collapse. You are making sandcastles or you are making palaces of
playing cards: just a little breeze and the whole palace will fall down.
But if love is the foundation of a life that not even death can destroy,
love opens the door to life eternal. The life of the soul is possible
only through the life of love. Love is the bridge between the body and
the soul, hence love has a paradoxical nature. On the one hand, if you
look at it through the body it is sex; on the other hand, if you look at
it through the soul it is prayer. But it is the same energy. Love
functioning physiologically is sex and functioning spiritually is
prayer. The work of a sannyasin consists in transforming sexual energy
into prayer. That day is the greatest in your life when your sex is
transformed into prayer, when your sex has no sexuality in it but
becomes prayerful, when your sex does not drag you downwards, is no more
part of the gravitational field, but starts helping you rise
upwards.</p><p>There are two laws: one of gravitation, that which pulls you down;
and the other</p><p>of grace, that which pulls you up. Sex has to be transformed from
gravitation to grace. This is <em>real</em> alchemy.</p><p>My sannyas is not a renunciation of life but a transformation. It is
not an escape but a great adventure.</p><p>Satyo.</p><p>Bliss is truth. Don't seek truth, seek bliss, and truth will find you
of its own accord.</p><p>Those who seek truth directly never find it. Their search becomes
more and more intellectual and logical; it becomes intellectual
gymnastics. That's how philosophy is born.</p><p>Seek bliss. Then it is a totally different search. Then you will come
across love, not across logic; then you will come across music, not
mathematics; then you will be more close to poetry than to prose. Your
dimension will start changing. You will be more and more celebrating,
you will be more and more festive, less and less serious.</p><p>Let cheerfulness be your only discipline. Then one day one is
surprised: truth has knocked on one's door. when you are totally in
bliss time ceases. when you are totally in bliss you disappear, you melt
away --</p><p>and that is the moment, the momentous moment, when truth enters. Call
it God, nirvana, enlightenment, tao, or whatsoever name you choose: It
has no name, it is a nameless experience. But it comes only to those who
are dancing, singing, celebrating. It never comes to serious people.
Seriousness is illness, it is pathological.</p><p>Blissfulness is wholeness, health. Narayanyo</p><p>You are made of the stuff called God. Of course we are not aware of
it but that does not make any difference: aware or unaware, awake or
asleep, you are divine. and one who is asleep this moment can be awake
the next.</p><p>The function of the master is to wake you up and the whole approach
of a</p><p>disciple is to be ready to be awakened. In the beginning it is
arduous because you are having beautiful dreams and the master goes on
shaking and shocking you. It is cold and too early and you would like to
sleep a little more. And you feel angry with the master many times
because he goes on persisting: Wake up!</p><p>To be a disciple means that you will allow the master to force you,
to wake you up; that the more he hammers you, the more grateful you will
be. Of course once in a while you will feel angry but then you have to
remember that by being a disciple you have chosen to be hit, to be
hammered, to be dragged out of your sleep. All kinds of devices are
bound to be used: cold water has to be thrown over you, your blankets
have to be taken away. You have to be pulled and pushed, and all kinds
of imaginable and unimaginable 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on

disciple. But if one cooperates with the master it can happen very
easily. The difficulty becomes more and more complex because of
resistance. Don't resist, cooperate, and something of immense value is
possible... something for which you will remain eternally grateful.</p><p>George Gurdjieff remembers that when his grandmother was dying she
called him to the side of her bed.</p><p>He was very young, just nine years old, and the very old woman
whispered in the ears of this boy.… She had loved this boy more than
anybody else. She said to him, 'I have a message for you -- remember it,
never forget. It is a simple message, but if you can practise it, it
will open the doors of great treasures for you. And the message is
really simple.' She simply said, 'Remember this sentence 'Never do as
others do,' and follow it." Whenever anybody asked Gurdjieff, 'How did
you become enlightened? How did you become what you have become?" he
always said, 'The whole credit goes to my grandmother, because she said
to me 'Never do as others do.' So I made it a point if others were going
to the north I would go to the south, if others were standing on their
feet I would stand on my head. Through following her advice I have
attained whatsoever I have attained.'</p><p>The crowd consists of sleepwalkers. Be unique, be individual. That is
the only way to be a sannyasin. So never do as others do -- that is the
meaning of your name! How long will you be here?</p><p>-- Two months.</p><p>-- Good. Do a few groups, mm? And choose the groups which nobody else
chooses!</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=scriptures-in-silence-and-sermons-in-stones>Scriptures in Silence

It is for reference purposes only.]\nDeva means God; staffan means crowned by -- crowned by God. That's exactly the meaning of the word\n\"christ\": crowned by God. But Christ had to go trough a very rare crowing ceremony: crucifixion was the first step. That has always been so and will be always so: unless one dies, unless the ego dies, god cannot crown you. You can be crowned only when you are not.\nMeditate on that paradox. When you are, you are as far away from God as possible: when you are not, you are God -- that is the crowing. When you are absolutely empty god starts filling you from every nook and corner, from every direction and dimension. You are overflooded. That is the crowing.\nAnd unless a man is crowned by God he lives in vain. He lives not; he only exists, and to only exist is to live in hell. To live is a higher state of existence; it is a conscious state of existence. The rock exists. The ordinary man believes that he lives but he only exists like the rock. Only a Buddha or a Christ lives. But how to live, how to come to this ultimate glory? Only through disappearance does one come to it.\nBe ready to be annihilated -- and that's what sannyas is all about. It is surrendering to the Master to be annihilated. Once you are not, everything fits perfectly; a deep harmony arises. When you are not there are no discordant notes. When you are not it is all music and all poetry, all celebration.\nAntar means inner, innermost, and stefan means a voice -- the innermost voice of your being. It is the same word as \"staffan\". In Greek Stefan, Staffan, means crowned. This is the Teutonic meaning of the same word: voice. We go on listening to the outside hence we go on missing the inner voice, and God speaks from your innermost core.\nIn the Master you only hear the echo of your innermost being. The Master functions as a mirror: he reflects your original face. He says what God wants to say to you because you are not ready to listen to your own inner self. Listening to the Master slowly slowly you become aware of the tremendous phenomenon that there is a synchronicity between the Master and your inner voice, that the master only speaks on behalf of your own inner self. Hence surrendering to the Master is not surrendering to anybody else, but to your 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- own center.\nWe live on the periphery, we live in the mind, and the mind is so noisy that it does not allow us to hear the still, small voice within. A Master is needed only as a device because you hear the outside. The Master says from the outside what God has been trying to tell you from the inside for centuries. But you don't listen to the inner.\nListening to the inner Master slowly slowly one becomes conscious: What is happening? The Master is speaking the same things that somehow you feel to be your own, more your own than your mind, more your own than your body. That's why the East calls the Master, God. The West is absolutely unable to understand the phenomenon. The East knows why the Master is called god: he represents God, he reflects God, because he reflects your reality, your true being.\nBeing with the Mater is simply getting ready to turn in one day so that you can close your eyes and look in, so that you can start hearing what your own intuition goes on telling you. And the intuition is always right. The intellect may be right, may be wrong, it is always either-or, doubt persists, it is never undubitable.\nBut intuition is without any doubt, it simply knows. The intuitive person never repents because he never does anything wrong, he cannot. He simply follows God's voice within him.\n(Anand Manish: bliss, wisdom)\nThere is a possibility of being blissful without being wise, but that blissfulness is not true blissfulness; it is what people call happiness. It comes and goes, it is momentary. And it always leaves you in deep frustration and despair. The cost is too much and not worth it.\nThere is also the possibility of being wise without being blissful, but that wisdom is also pseudo and false. It is known as knowledge. It is borrowed, it is a burden. Anything that has not arisen out of your experience is always a bondage. It can nourish your ego but is cannot reveal your self to you. The true seeker has to find bliss and wisdom together. And both can be easily found together because they are like two wings of the bird, meditation.\nMeditate: on one hand you become blissful and on the other hand you become wise; both grow simultaneously in a kind of deep synchronicity. In the ultimate state bliss becomes wisdom, wisdom becomes bliss.\n(Dorothy becomes Anand Vandan: bliss, prayer)\nAs far as I am concerned to be blissful is to be prayerful. All other prayers are formal. You can say beautiful words but they are only on the lips. Words belong to the mind; the heart knows no words. It is wordless, it is silent; it is lovefull but wordless. It is cheerful; it can sing, but in silence. It can dance, but in a very invisible way.\nThe head is gross; hence everything of the head is visible; it is matter, it is machine. The heart is the center of the invisible. It is not matter, it is consciousness. The heart knows how to be blissful, how to be longing. And being blissful opens the doors.\nPeople go to God only in despair. That is the wrong moment to go to him because when you are in despair you are closed. He is available but just his being available to you is of no use unless you are availablr to him. People remember God only when they are in misery, and that is not the right time to remember him. Hence their prayers go down the drain, they never reach to God. And their prayers are more or less complaints, complaints against the misery and demands, desires that things should be better. Those are not real prayers.\nA real prayer has only one flavor, that of gratitude; only one frangrance, that of immense gratefulness. It knows no demand, no desire. And because God has given so much, because God has been so gracious, the heart is silently bowing down to the ultimate. That is vandan; that is real prayer, the very essence of prayer!\nBe blissful and let that be your prayer. And God is not far away; he never has been: he is just around the corner. The moment the heart is ready he immediately enters. He will not knock on the doors because that is interfering in your freedom. He will not trespass on his own, he respects human dignity. Unless you invite him he will wait.\nPrayer is a way of inviting him. And the bet way to invite him is to invite him when you are in a dance, when your whole being is singing, when you are just joy, when every fiber is pulsating with celebration.\nThen he is ready to come in immediately. There is not even a single moment's gap: instantly it happens.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nFulfil the only condition: be blissful. (Ma Prem Kavisho: love poet)\nLove is the only real poetry. When the heart is full of love your whole life is\ntransformed from prose to poetry, from noise to music, from discord to harmony.\nA heart without love is a desert, and the man with a heart without love remains ugly. His approach towards life is very unpoetic. He has no aesthetic sensibility, no sense to apreciate the beauty of existence and no awareness to be grateful for all that God has done, for all that the universe is. Only the poet knows how to praise and how to be grateful and how to dance and sing and how to celebrate life and its tremendous blissfulness.\nIt is such a sheer joy to be. Just to be is enough, more than is needed, but one needs to be sensitive to feel it, one needs to grow feelers. That's my work here: to help grow feelers in you so that life is no longer a thought but becomes more a feeling. Once you have moved from thinking to feeling then is only one step more, and that is from feeling to being; and that is very simple. The first step is very difficult. The second comes almost automatically: there's nothing you have to do for it. The first is very arduous: you have to do much to move from thinking to feeling. But from feeling to being the distance is none at all. It can happen any moment. The poet can become the mystic at any moment. The real problem is how to get out of your thinking and get more and more into feeling.\nLove more, feel more, enjoy more, so that you can feed your heart. Watch the sunrise, the sunset, the clouds, the rainbows, the birds on the wings, the flowers, the animals, the rocks, the people -- look into their eyes. It is such a multidimensional existence. Look into every dimension but look as a poet: to praise, to feel. Be ecstatic!\n(to Gourishankear)\nMuch is going to happen -- get ready! And don't be afraid when it happens. The only barrier is fear, because when things start happening one becoems afraid. One is moving into the unknown, and the mind wants to cling to the known because the mind is clever with the known. With the unknown the mind has nothing to say. With the unknown the mind is absolutely at a loss as to what to do. It looses all its expertise.\nIt is simply shocked into silence as it encounters the unknown.\nIt is a great expert as far as the familiar and the known is concerned because mind is nothing but memory. It can give you all kinds of information but only about the known. It is just like a computer: first you feed the information to the\ncomputer, then the computer is always ready to give the information back --\nbut only that much, that which you have fed to it, nothing more, maybe new combinations of the old things but nothing really original. Mind knows no originality, but with the known it can pretend, it can feel great; it is an expert.\nA child was asking his mother \"What is an expert?\" The mother said \"The expert does the same thing that we women do, but when we do it, men call it nagging.\"\nMind is a great expert, a great nagger. It goes on goading you, nagging you: Do this. Do that. It opens many many alternatives and is constantly persuading you, seducing you, corrupting you: Go this way.\nPurchase this. Enjoy that. It keeps you occupied with the known.\nThe work that you are entering into now as a sannyasin is concerned with the unknown, the uncharted, the unmapped territory; so fear will be there. That is the only barrier. In spite of it go on. Let the fear be there. It will hang around you for a while, and when you do not listen to it, it will leave you. The day fear of the unknown leaves is a great day. From that day growth becomes simple and easy and spontaneous.\nScriptures in Silence and Sermons in Stones Chapter #8 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2045","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/scriptures_in_silence_and_sermons_in_stone/part7/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/scriptures_in_silence_and_sermons_in_stone/>Scriptures In Silence And Sermons In Stone</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>10 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2045 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Scriptures_In_Silence_And_Sermons_In_Stone/part7.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part6>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

blissfulness.</p><p>It is such a sheer joy to be. Just to be is enough, more than is
needed, but one needs to be sensitive to feel it, one needs to grow
feelers. That's my work here: to help grow feelers in you so that life
is no longer a thought but becomes more a feeling. Once you have moved
from thinking to feeling then is only one step more, and that is from
feeling to being; and that is very simple. The first step is very
difficult. The second comes almost automatically: there's nothing you
have to do for it. The first is very arduous: you have to do much to
move from thinking to feeling. But from feeling to being the distance is
none at all. It can happen any moment. The poet can become the mystic at
any moment. The real problem is how to get out of your thinking and get
more and more into feeling.</p><p>Love more, feel more, enjoy more, so that you can feed your heart.
Watch the sunrise, the sunset, the clouds, the rainbows, the birds on
the wings, the flowers, the animals, the rocks, the people -- look into
their eyes. It is such a multidimensional existence. Look into every
dimension but look as a poet: to praise, to feel. Be ecstatic!</p><p>(to Gourishankear)</p><p>Much is going to happen -- get ready! And don't be afraid when it
happens. The only barrier is fear, because when things start happening
one becoems afraid. One is moving into the unknown, and the mind wants
to cling to the known because the mind is clever with the known. With
the unknown the mind has nothing to say. With the unknown the mind is
absolutely at a loss as to what to do. It looses all its expertise.</p><p>It is simply shocked into silence as it encounters the unknown.</p><p>It is a great expert as far as the familiar and the known is
concerned because mind is nothing but memory. It can give you all kinds
of information but only about the known. It is just like a computer:
first you feed the information to the</p><p>computer, then the computer is always ready to give the information
back --</p><p>but only that much, that which you have fed to it, nothing more,
maybe new combinations of the old things but nothing really original.
Mind knows no originality, but with the known it can pretend, it can
feel great; it is an expert.</p><p>A child was asking his mother "What is an expert?" The mother said
"The expert does the same thing that we women do, but when we do it, men
call it nagging."</p><p>Mind is a great expert, a great nagger. It goes on goading you,
nagging you: Do this. Do that. It opens many many alternatives and is
constantly persuading you, seducing you, corrupting you: Go this
way.</p><p>Purchase this. Enjoy that. It keeps you occupied with the known.</p><p>The work that you are entering into now as a sannyasin is concerned
with the unknown, the uncharted, the unmapped territory; so fear will be
there. That is the only barrier. In spite of it go on. Let the fear be
there. It will hang around you for a while, and when you do not listen
to it, it will leave you. The day fear of the unknown leaves is a great
day. From that day growth becomes simple and easy and spontaneous.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=scriptures-in-silence-and-sermons-in-stones>Scriptures in Silence

It is for reference purposes only.]\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nTrue bliss always brings peace. If it does not bring peace then something was false in it, then it was pseudo; then it was not bliss. It may have been pleasure, it may have been happiness, it may even have been joy, but it was not bliss, because pleasure, happiness, joy -- they never bring peace; on the contrary, they disturb. They are states of excitement. When you feel pleasure you are really excited, you are feverish. It is passion. You are not calm and quiet and cool, you are hot. Hence pleasure tires. Sooner or later one gets fed up with it.\nReal bliss is judged only by the flower of peace. It brings peace, it deepens peace, it takes all fever away. It makes you utterly at home in existence, so utterly at home that you almost disappear, you don't exist... because the very idea of I is a disturbance. It is not a peaceful state. When the lake is totally peaceful\nthere are no waves, no thoughts, no desires; one is suddenly in harmony with tao, with dhamma, with the universal law of existence.\nSo remember it: attain to a peace which brings bliss, attain to a bliss which brings peace. If one of them is missing then the other is pseudo; only together are they true. That's the criterion.\nLove brings peace naturally, spontaneously, without any effort. Hate brings war naturally, automatically, without any effort. We want a peaceful world and we try in many ways to create the climate of peace without recognizing the fundamental, that unless we teach people how to love there is no possibility of peace. More and more love energies have to be released, then only will peace be the outcome.\nThe world has lived in war: in three thousand years we have fought five thousand wars. This is something unbelievable. It is as if men are only meant to fight and kill each other, as if our whole existence is insane from the very roots. War seems to be the natural thing, peace seems to be unnatural because peace is so rare.\nWar is always going on: sometimes in the name of religion, sometimes in the name of political ideology, sometimes something else. We find excuses and we go on fighting. Any excuse will do -- the real thing is to fight.\nWe are boiling within. We don't know what to do with our energies, and our societies have been teaching us to be repressive so we go on repressing the energies. Those energies become too much, they want to explode. So either a person goes individually insane or the whole society goes insane. War is a social insanity. And now we have world wars: after each ten years the whole world goes mad for a few years. Then some relaxation, some rest, some possibility of peace for a few years... That peace is also not much of a peace. It is only a tiredness, exhaustion because of the war, and again we start preparing for war.\nSo our peace is nothing but a cold war.\nReal peace is possible only if we start working from the very beginning of man's life. No repression should be the rule. Energies have to be transformed into loving energies -- and that can be done very easily, it is not difficult at all.\nMan has inexhaustible capacities for love; he has just not been given\nopportunities. My effort here is to create an opportunity for the sannyasins so that their love energies can start becoming alive. Once your love energies are moving, are dynamic, all that is negative -- hate, anger -- disappears, because it is the same energies in a perverted form.\nLove brings peace, and if we want a peaceful world we will have to create a great movement for love.\nMy sannyas is a great movement for love. It has nothing much to do with god, nothing much to do with paradise, because one thing I am absolutely certain of is that love will bring everything;. It will bring peace, it will bring a better human being, a new kind of human being, it will bring a new spirituality, a new kind of religiousness, it will bring a new vision of god. It will bring a new paradise on earth, herenow. And whatsoever we can do herenow, we can do even after death, because it is the same life that continues.\nVeet means going beyond. Gunther means courageous in war, brave in war.\nThere are two types of people in the world, people can be divided into two categories. One is the soldier type, the second is the sannyasin type.\nGunther means the soldier type, the fighter, the warrior: aggressive, violent. Those are qualities in the world of the soldier, but those are disqualifications in the world of the sannyasin. Here we have to learn not to conquer but to surrender, not to fight but to disappear into the whole, because all fight is out of the ego, and the ego has to be dropped. Then only does one become a sannyasin.\nVeet Gunther will mean: so beyond all qualities of the soldier. That going beyond is entering into the world of the sannyasin. From now onwards be more receptive, more loving, more feminine less German!\nI have heard a story. A German used to work in a factory which made small carriages for children.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nAgain and again his wife asked him to steal a carriage for their child. He said \"It is difficult to steal the whole carriage, but I will bring it part by part.\"\nSo every day he would bring another part; by the end of the month he had brought all the parts necessary.\nOne Sunday he said, \"Now I will assemble them.\" He worked continuously from morning to evening, trying this way and that, fixing things this way and that way. His wife was puzzled. She said, \"How long will it take?\" The husband said, \"I am puzzled too, because all the ways I put it together, it turns out a gun! I have tried all possible trays; it always comes out a gun!\"\nThat has become a characteristic of the German mind: turn it any way and out comes a gun!\nTo be a sannyasin means that you will have to drop that whole approach. Adolf Hitler and Gautam Buddha are polar opposites. And Buddhahood is not possible through fighting but only through a deep let-go. If you can learn the state of let- go great blessing will start showering on you.\nAnd it is not only a question of one individual becoming a sannyasin; our effort is to create a tidal wave of sannyas all over the world, because that is the only possibility of going beyond war, the only possibility of going beyond nations, races, churches, the only possibility of making this earth a paradise. a Buddha says: This very body the Buddha, this very earth the lotus paradise. That's exactly our motto.\nAttachment is the root cause of all misery. Possessiveness is nourishment for the ego.\nThe way of possessing things is the way of the world. To be a sannyasin means being in the world with the attitude of non-possessiveness. Enjoy everything -- there is no need to possess. You don't possess the sunset, still you enjoy it. You don't possess all the stars, still you enjoy them. There is no need to possess in order to enjoy. In fact the more you possess, the less you enjoy, because you become more and more worried about your possessions, their security, safety. In fact your possessions start possessing you. You become just a servant, you are no more a master.\nTo be a sannyasin is a declaration that 'From now onwards I am going to be a master, not a servant.' And this is the secret of mastery: be unattached to everything. And I am not saying to renounce, I am saying to be in the world, to live in the world, and to live totally -- but with no possessiveness. When things are there, good; when they are not there, that too is perfectly good. When you have a beautiful palace enjoy it; when it disappears a dream is over. Then whatsoever is available, enjoy that.\nA sannyasin should be able to enjoy every possibility: he will enjoy the day, he will enjoy the night, he will enjoy life, he will enjoy death, he will enjoy friendship and he will enjoy aloneness.\nIan has both possibilities: he can be a rock or he can be a flower. If he remains in the head he remains a rock. If he moves towards the heart he becomes a flower. And we are taught only the ways of the head, not the ways of the heart, because the world does not need the ways of the heart; in fact it is afraid of the heart.\nIt teaches you mathematics, logic, economics. It teaches you to be calculative, clever, diplomatic, because those are the things which are going to pay, those are the qualities that you will need in the competition of life.\nIt does not teach you poetry, it does not teach you love, it does not teach you music, because those things are not going to pay, and the people who try to live music and poetry and love prove to be rebellious.\nThe politicians and the priests have known for a long time that the people who live in the heart are dangerous people because they will not obey authority and they will not follow the tradition and they will not listen to the scriptures, they will not bor down unless they feel to. They cannot be ordered and manipulated, they cannot be reduced to slaves. They live spontaneously, moment to moment, and they always want to do their thing. But the society is not interested in individuals; it is interested in the mass, the crowd. Hence the society tries to avoid the heart. It diverts your energies towards the head, and the head is a rock; nothing grows there.\nBy becoming a sannyasin you are becoming committed to a new vision. Now the whole work will be to bring your energies back to the heart. Then you will transcend the rocklike qualities, and the same energy that becomes a rock in the head becomes a flower in the heart.\nA sannyasin has to be a flower, because only a flower can be accepted as an offering to god. Only a flower will be able to reach the feet of the divine.\nWhatsoever you can gain from the scriptures will be knowledge. Hence one has to stop accumulating unnecessary knowledge, information; one has to dive inwards to find that source of light within oneself. It is 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nalready there, we just have to move towards that point.\nSannyas has to become the turning point, the critical moment, the radical moment. Energy is no longer to be wasted in the outside; more and more of it is to go inwards, to the source. And there one comes across oneself, one comes across the meaning of life, one comes across God.\nPersonality is a social phenomenon. It is given to you by others, it is not your true self. You don't bring it with you into the world and you will not be able to take it with you when you go from the world. But there is something more to your being than the personality, you are not a mere personality. There is something essential which is your real being, which comes before your birth and will continue after your death. That is the inner one, the real one -- call it the self.\nSannyas is the search for the self. And in searching for the self one has to become disidentified with the personality. It is painful to become disidentified with the personality, but it is worth it. Once you have become disidentified with it, great blessings shower on you. Then eternal bliss is yours.\nEnlightenment is like the full moon in the dark night of the soul. The full moon has a few qualities which are symbolically meaningful in understanding enlightenment. It is light but cool. The sun is also light, but it is hot. Enlightenment is a cool light.\nThe moon is not only cool, it has a certain subtle, hidden impact, a subtle aura of energy around it. The oceans are affected by it and man is also affected by it.\nMore men go crazy on the full-moon night than on any other night; more men commit suicide on the full -- moon night than on any other night. More poetry is born on the full-moon night than on any other night. More love happens on the full-moon night than on any other night, and more people have become enlightened on the full-moon night than on any other night.\nBuddha was born on the full-moon night; he became enlightened on the full- moon night and also died on the full-moon night. The full moon has some inner bridge with human heart. It stirs your heart, not your reason. Reason is more in tune with the sun, intuition is more in tune with the moon. And enlightenment is more a feminine phenomenon than a masculine phenomenon. It is more a receptivity, it is like a womb. The enlightened person becomes a womb and receives god in his being, becomes pregnant with god. The moon is feminine.\nRemember: you have to become a full moon. The name will remind you again and again.\nThese names are given for a certain purpose. The meaning that I give to the name is a message for you.\nIt will take your whole life to decode it, it will take your whole life to live it, but if you can manage to live it the kingdom of god is yours!\nSahajo means spontaneity -- and that is my basic message: Be spontaneous. Don't live out of the past, live moment to moment; don't react; respond. Reaction comes from the past -- past experiences, knowledge, and you act out of that knowledge. It never fits with the moment. Either you are lagging behind or you are far ahead, but you are never in tune with the moment, because no two moments are the same. Whatsoever you have experienced in the past will never be relevant again.\nIt may appear many times that 'This is relevant', but it can't be. No two moments are similar, each moment has its own uniqueness. And that's the difference between reaction and response. To accept the challenge of the uniqueness of the moment and to respond out of your present consciousness, not out of your past memories, is spontaneity. To be spontaneous means to be always in tune with time, to be always with the moment. There is no gap between you and the moment. Neither is the past standing there between you and the moment; nor is the future standing between you and the moment. There is nobody between you\nand the moment; the impact is total, the contact is total.\nIn that immediacy whatsoever happens is right, and brings bliss, and brings god closer and closer to you!\nScriptures in Silence and Sermons in Stones 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Chapter #37\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2673","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/scriptures_in_silence_and_sermons_in_stone/part36/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/scriptures_in_silence_and_sermons_in_stone/>Scriptures In Silence And Sermons In Stone</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>13 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2673 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Scriptures_In_Silence_And_Sermons_In_Stone/part36.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part35>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

not to conquer but to surrender, not to fight but to disappear into the
whole, because all fight is out of the ego, and the ego has to be
dropped. Then only does one become a sannyasin.</p><p>Veet Gunther will mean: so beyond all qualities of the soldier. That
going beyond is entering into the world of the sannyasin. From now
onwards be more receptive, more loving, more feminine less German!</p><p>I have heard a story. A German used to work in a factory which made
small carriages for children.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>Again and again his wife asked him to steal a carriage for their
child. He said "It is difficult to steal the whole carriage, but I will
bring it part by part."</p><p>So every day he would bring another part; by the end of the month he
had brought all the parts necessary.</p><p>One Sunday he said, "Now I will assemble them." He worked
continuously from morning to evening, trying this way and that, fixing
things this way and that way. His wife was puzzled. She said, "How long
will it take?" The husband said, "I am puzzled too, because all the ways
I put it together, it turns out a gun! I have tried all possible trays;
it always comes out a gun!"</p><p>That has become a characteristic of the German mind: turn it any way
and out comes a gun!</p><p>To be a sannyasin means that you will have to drop that whole
approach. Adolf Hitler and Gautam Buddha are polar opposites. And
Buddhahood is not possible through fighting but only through a deep
let-go. If you can learn the state of let- go great blessing will start
showering on you.</p><p>And it is not only a question of one individual becoming a sannyasin;
our effort is to create a tidal wave of sannyas all over the world,
because that is the only possibility of going beyond war, the only
possibility of going beyond nations, races, churches, the only
possibility of making this earth a paradise. a Buddha says: This very
body the Buddha, this very earth the lotus paradise. That's exactly our
motto.</p><p>Attachment is the root cause of all misery. Possessiveness is
nourishment for the ego.</p><p>The way of possessing things is the way of the world. To be a
sannyasin means being in the world with the attitude of
non-possessiveness. Enjoy everything -- there is no need to possess. You
don't possess the sunset, still you enjoy it. You don't possess all the
stars, still you enjoy them. There is no need to possess in order to
enjoy. In fact the more you possess, the less you enjoy, because you
become more and more worried about your possessions, their security,
safety. In fact your possessions start possessing you. You become just a
servant, you are no more a master.</p><p>To be a sannyasin is a declaration that 'From now onwards I am going
to be a master, not a servant.' And this is the secret of mastery: be
unattached to everything. And I am not saying to renounce, I am saying
to be in the world, to live in the world, and to live totally -- but
with no possessiveness. When things are there, good; when they are not
there, that too is perfectly good. When you have a beautiful palace
enjoy it; when it disappears a dream is over. Then whatsoever is
available, enjoy that.</p><p>A sannyasin should be able to enjoy every possibility: he will enjoy
the day, he will enjoy the night, he will enjoy life, he will enjoy
death, he will enjoy friendship and he will enjoy aloneness.</p><p>Ian has both possibilities: he can be a rock or he can be a flower.
If he remains in the head he remains a rock. If he moves towards the
heart he becomes a flower. And we are taught only the ways of the head,
not the ways of the heart, because the world does not need the ways of
the heart; in fact it is afraid of the heart.</p><p>It teaches you mathematics, logic, economics. It teaches you to be
calculative, clever, diplomatic, because those are the things which are
going to pay, those are the qualities that you will need in the
competition of life.</p><p>It does not teach you poetry, it does not teach you love, it does not
teach you music, because those things are not going to pay, and the
people who try to live music and poetry and love prove to be
rebellious.</p><p>The politicians and the priests have known for a long time that the
people who live in the heart are dangerous people because they will not
obey authority and they will not follow the tradition and they will not
listen to the scriptures, they will not bor down unless they feel to.
They cannot be ordered and manipulated, they cannot be reduced to
slaves. They live spontaneously, moment to moment, and they always want
to do their thing. But the society is not interested in individuals; it
is interested in the mass, the crowd. Hence the society tries to avoid
the heart. It diverts your energies towards the head, and the head is a
rock; nothing grows there.</p><p>By becoming a sannyasin you are becoming committed to a new vision.
Now the whole work will be to bring your energies back to the heart.
Then you will transcend the rocklike qualities, and the same energy that
becomes a rock in the head becomes a flower in the heart.</p><p>A sannyasin has to be a flower, because only a flower can be accepted
as an offering to god. Only a flower will be able to reach the feet of
the divine.</p><p>Whatsoever you can gain from the scriptures will be knowledge. Hence
one has to stop accumulating unnecessary knowledge, information; one has
to dive inwards to find that source of light within oneself. It is
1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>already there, we just have to move towards that point.</p><p>Sannyas has to become the turning point, the critical moment, the
radical moment. Energy is no longer to be wasted in the outside; more
and more of it is to go inwards, to the source. And there one comes
across oneself, one comes across the meaning of life, one comes across
God.</p><p>Personality is a social phenomenon. It is given to you by others, it
is not your true self. You don't bring it with you into the world and
you will not be able to take it with you when you go from the world. But
there is something more to your being than the personality, you are not
a mere personality. There is something essential which is your real
being, which comes before your birth and will continue after your death.
That is the inner one, the real one -- call it the self.</p><p>Sannyas is the search for the self. And in searching for the self one
has to become disidentified with the personality. It is painful to
become disidentified with the personality, but it is worth it. Once you
have become disidentified with it, great blessings shower on you. Then
eternal bliss is yours.</p><p>Enlightenment is like the full moon in the dark night of the soul.
The full moon has a few qualities which are symbolically meaningful in
understanding enlightenment. It is light but cool. The sun is also
light, but it is hot. Enlightenment is a cool light.</p><p>The moon is not only cool, it has a certain subtle, hidden impact, a
subtle aura of energy around it. The oceans are affected by it and man
is also affected by it.</p><p>More men go crazy on the full-moon night than on any other night;
more men commit suicide on the full -- moon night than on any other
night. More poetry is born on the full-moon night than on any other
night. More love happens on the full-moon night than on any other night,
and more people have become enlightened on the full-moon night than on
any other night.</p><p>Buddha was born on the full-moon night; he became enlightened on the
full- moon night and also died on the full-moon night. The full moon has
some inner bridge with human heart. It stirs your heart, not your
reason. Reason is more in tune with the sun, intuition is more in tune
with the moon. And enlightenment is more a feminine phenomenon than a
masculine phenomenon. It is more a receptivity, it is like a womb. The
enlightened person becomes a womb and receives god in his being, becomes
pregnant with god. The moon is feminine.</p><p>Remember: you have to become a full moon. The name will remind you
again and again.</p><p>These names are given for a certain purpose. The meaning that I give
to the name is a message for you.</p><p>It will take your whole life to decode it, it will take your whole
life to live it, but if you can manage to live it the kingdom of god is
yours!</p><p>Sahajo means spontaneity -- and that is my basic message: Be
spontaneous. Don't live out of the past, live moment to moment; don't
react; respond. Reaction comes from the past -- past experiences,
knowledge, and you act out of that knowledge. It never fits with the
moment. Either you are lagging behind or you are far ahead, but you are
never in tune with the moment, because no two moments are the same.
Whatsoever you have experienced in the past will never be relevant
again.</p><p>It may appear many times that 'This is relevant', but it can't be. No
two moments are similar, each moment has its own uniqueness. And that's
the difference between reaction and response. To accept the challenge of
the uniqueness of the moment and to respond out of your present
consciousness, not out of your past memories, is spontaneity. To be
spontaneous means to be always in tune with time, to be always with the
moment. There is no gap between you and the moment. Neither is the past
standing there between you and the moment; nor is the future standing
between you and the moment. There is nobody between you</p><p>and the moment; the impact is total, the contact is total.</p><p>In that immediacy whatsoever happens is right, and brings bliss, and
brings god closer and closer to you!</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=scriptures-in-silence-and-sermons-in-stones>Scriptures in Silence

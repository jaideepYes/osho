And ninety-nine per cent of the time this is the case. People tell each other that they love but all that they want is to dominate the other. Love is only a strategy: they want to possess the other, then want to reduce the other to a thing. They destroy the freedom of the other; hence love which should bring great bliss instead brings great misery. This is not love. One has to learn the difference between true love and false love.\nBefore you can know the true you have to understand the false as the false. To see the false as the false is the first step towards knowing the true as the true. A few ingredients can be indicated. The most important of all is: love gives freedom. It never possesses the other, it never reduces the other to a thing. It\nenhances the other's soul. It gives significance and meaning to the other person. It transforms the other person into an end, not a means.\nLove in such a way that whomsoever you love you help to be more free. That will do two things: first, it will give you a taste of true love, and second, it will also give you the great joy of sharing freedom, of giving freedom to others. And the more you make others free, you become free; the more you make others slaves, the more you become a slave. Whatsoever you do to others will be done to you. Hence Jesus is right when he says, 'Do unto others what you would like to be done to you.'\nFranz means freedom.\nFreedom is the most significant phenomenon in existence. Except for man nobody can be free; only man has the potential to be free. Except for man the whole existence is unfree, it is bound by the law of cause and effect. Everything is determined. That's why science is possible. At one hundred degrees water evaporates, always. There is no change in it; it is a determined phenomenon. The water is not free to choose, it cannot decide, it cannot change its course. Only man has the capacity to be unpredictable. But not all men achieve it; with the majority it remains only a potentiality, it never becomes an actuality.\nBeing initiated into a mystery school simply means that now you are taking the first step towards actualising your potential for freedom. When man becomes really free -- free from the cause-and-effect chain -- he is a Buddha, he is a Christ. Then he lives in freedom.\nThat is another meaning of franz: living in freedom. But only a Buddha lives in freedom. All other freedoms are just pseudo, political freedom, economic freedom, social freedom -- these are all pseudo freedoms. The real freedom consists only of one thing, and that is spiritual freedom.\nIt is possible. It is a great gift of god to man. But it is dangerous too, because man can fall. No other animal can fall. Adam and Eve fell from grace. They had the possibility to be free but they chose a wrong course. They could have freely obeyed god or freely disobeyed god; it was up to them. If you freely choose to disobey, that is sin. if you freely decide to obey, to surrender to existence, to be part of it, that is enlightenment.\nConstance means perseverance, constancy, devoted spirit -- all these meanings\nare there.\nLove needs all three. It needs perseverance, the greatest perseverance, because it is moving towards great heights. One can lose the track very easily. It is an uphill task. One can be lethargic, lazy, one can go on postponing, for tomorrow, but tomorrow never comes and the peak remains far away, just a dream. The dream can become a reality, but constant effort will be needed; hence the second meaning.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nOne has to go on and on making efforts. Many times one fails, but if one persists and remains constant in one's efforts, one day the great phenomenon happens: one bursts forth into a flame of love.\nAnd yes, the third meaning is also important: great devotion is needed. Love is not lust, it is basically devotion. Just is a pseudo entity: it gives you a feeling as if you were in love. You are not in love, you are just exploiting the other person. Devotion is totally different, you are surrendered to the other, there is no question of exploitation. You are not using the other as a means, the other is an end unto himself. You are totally surrendered. It is trust, it is devotion, it is prayer.\nLet love be your religion, then no other religion is needed, because it is the essence of all the religions, the very innermost core of all the Buddhas, Christs, Krishnas.\nLove is the only real way of praising god. If you really want to praise god the only way is to love existence, to love it unconditionally. The more you love, the more mysteries will be revealed to you; the more you love, the more existence becomes lovable, because you become more and more open. And the more you love, the more you feel the presence of god everywhere. Then whatsoever you do becomes praise: your sitting, your standing, your walking. Even small acts become prayerful. Your whole life becomes deep gratitude. And certainly that\ngratitude brings contentment, fulfilment, fruition, flowering.\nBliss is born out of infinite light. It is a ray of light entering into the darkness of our soul. We are a dark continent, and when god reaches us as a ray of light, that becomes the moment of metamorphosis; we are transformed from ordinary sleepy human beings into fully awake, divine beings. The moment the light enters we become light ourselves. We belong to the world of light -- although we have chosen to reside in darkness. That is our choice. We have decided to be part of hell while we can be part of heaven.\nFrom this moment you have to start changing your choice, your style of life, your ways of looking at things, so that slowly slowly you become capable of creating more bliss in your being.\nThe most fundamental need is to be open to the beyond, because light always descends, we are at the receiving end. And the meeting of light with our being is what bliss is all about. Darkness is misery, light is bliss.\nChrist is an ultimate state of consciousness, just like Buddha. In the East we call it Buddha, in the West the same consciousness is called Christ.\nChrist has nothing to do with Jesus, Buddha has nothing to do with Gautam Siddhartha. Gautam Siddhartha became Buddha; anybody can be a Buddha, you can be a Buddha. Jesus' became Christ; anybody can be a Christ, you can be a Christ. The East has not forgotten this but the West has completely forgotten it. In the East Buddha has not become confined to Gautam Siddhartha. There have been Buddhas before him, there have been Buddhas after him, and there will be Buddhas in the future. It simply indicates the ultimate flowering, the spring of consciousness.\nBut the West has completely forgotten it. Christians, particularly the Christian church, has been the cause of destroying this possibility. They have been fanatically claiming that there is only one Christ, and that is Jesus Christ, the only begotten son of god. This is a fanatical attitude, political. It is not religious at all.\nThere have been Christs before: Moses was a Christ, Abraham was a Christ. There have been Christs since: Francis is a Christ, Eckhart is a Christ. But the church goes on denying it, the church says there has been one and only one Christ, and there will never be another. This is the language of a fanatic, of a\nlunatic.\nYou have to remember it.\nChrist has to be freed from the church; the church has become his imprisonment. He made all possible efforts to make people free and people have done just the opposite to him; they have made a prisoner of him.\nCarrying Christ in the heart means carrying the ultimate possibility of blossoming. It has nothing to do with Christianity or Hinduism or Mohammedanism. The ultimate possibility of consciousness means: consciousness without content, a pure mirror, so that it can reflect that which is, so that it can reflect god.\nGrace is a by-product of meditation. The more silent you become inside, the more graceful you become on the outside. When you become an absolute pool of silence, an aura of grace arises around you and follows you like your shadow; that is the shadow of your soul. Just as the body makes a shadow, the soul also makes a shadow.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThe shadow of the body is visible to everybody, the shadow of the soul is visible only to those who have inner vision. Its beauty is tremendous. Physical beauty is nothing compared to it, physical beauty is almost ugliness compared to the beauty of spiritual grace. And that's the goal of a sannyasin. It has to be attained, it is our right to attain it. To miss it is sheer stupidity.\nThe most significant spiritual quality is contentment, There are only two possibilities, either you are continuously desiring more and more -- that keeps you in a turmoil, in tension, in anxiety -- or you are utterly contented, not desiring anything. Whatsoever is is more than enough, you are thankful for it. Then all tensions simply disappear. They cannot grow in the climate of contentment. All anxieties wither away. The contented person knows nothing of\nanguish, agony. He knows peace, he knows silence. And god can be contacted only when you are in absolute silence and peace.\nTo be in desire means to be away from god; to be without desire means to be close to god. When you are full of desires your back is towards god. With no desires you are facing god, encountering god -- and the greatest bliss is to face god. That's my whole work here, to help you turn towards god. A one-hundred- and-eighty-degree turn is needed.\nThe first birth is physical. It is nothing special: animals are also born, trees are also born. But for man there is a possibility of a second birth, the spiritual birth. That's what sannyas is all about. When one surrenders to a master one is reborn. That rebirth is real birth. In the East we call it twice-born or well-born.\nWith this birth life really starts; before it was only a kind of sleep. This is the first step towards awakening. Now much more has to be done. It is an arduous, long journey, but full of great blessings, great benedictions, great joys, ecstasies, adventures, thrills; at each step there are thrills, at each step there are surprises waiting for you. But great effort is needed, perseverance is needed. It is like digging a well: you will have to remove much earth, rocks, and only then slowly slowly will you reach the sources of water.\nThey are there, but much has to be removed first.\nGod is within you, but much has become accumulated around your being; that has to be removed, chunk by chunk. It hurts too, it is painful, but whenever a chunk is removed you feel a new weightlessness arising, new wings growing. And when all this garbage is dropped you are born anew.\nThat is our effort, to help people to be reborn, to be pure beings, to be Buddhas. It is everybody's right, but one has to claim it. It is not just given, you have to prepare yourself, you have to get ready for it. The moment you are ready, the host is ready, the guest arrives.\nScriptures in Silence and Sermons in Stones Chapter #32\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2104","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/scriptures_in_silence_and_sermons_in_stone/part31/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/scriptures_in_silence_and_sermons_in_stone/>Scriptures In Silence And Sermons In Stone</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>10 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2104 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Scriptures_In_Silence_And_Sermons_In_Stone/part31.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part30>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

simply indicates the ultimate flowering, the spring of
consciousness.</p><p>But the West has completely forgotten it. Christians, particularly
the Christian church, has been the cause of destroying this possibility.
They have been fanatically claiming that there is only one Christ, and
that is Jesus Christ, the only begotten son of god. This is a fanatical
attitude, political. It is not religious at all.</p><p>There have been Christs before: Moses was a Christ, Abraham was a
Christ. There have been Christs since: Francis is a Christ, Eckhart is a
Christ. But the church goes on denying it, the church says there has
been one and only one Christ, and there will never be another. This is
the language of a fanatic, of a</p><p>lunatic.</p><p>You have to remember it.</p><p>Christ has to be freed from the church; the church has become his
imprisonment. He made all possible efforts to make people free and
people have done just the opposite to him; they have made a prisoner of
him.</p><p>Carrying Christ in the heart means carrying the ultimate possibility
of blossoming. It has nothing to do with Christianity or Hinduism or
Mohammedanism. The ultimate possibility of consciousness means:
consciousness without content, a pure mirror, so that it can reflect
that which is, so that it can reflect god.</p><p>Grace is a by-product of meditation. The more silent you become
inside, the more graceful you become on the outside. When you become an
absolute pool of silence, an aura of grace arises around you and follows
you like your shadow; that is the shadow of your soul. Just as the body
makes a shadow, the soul also makes a shadow.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>The shadow of the body is visible to everybody, the shadow of the
soul is visible only to those who have inner vision. Its beauty is
tremendous. Physical beauty is nothing compared to it, physical beauty
is almost ugliness compared to the beauty of spiritual grace. And that's
the goal of a sannyasin. It has to be attained, it is our right to
attain it. To miss it is sheer stupidity.</p><p>The most significant spiritual quality is contentment, There are only
two possibilities, either you are continuously desiring more and more --
that keeps you in a turmoil, in tension, in anxiety -- or you are
utterly contented, not desiring anything. Whatsoever is is more than
enough, you are thankful for it. Then all tensions simply disappear.
They cannot grow in the climate of contentment. All anxieties wither
away. The contented person knows nothing of</p><p>anguish, agony. He knows peace, he knows silence. And god can be
contacted only when you are in absolute silence and peace.</p><p>To be in desire means to be away from god; to be without desire means
to be close to god. When you are full of desires your back is towards
god. With no desires you are facing god, encountering god -- and the
greatest bliss is to face god. That's my whole work here, to help you
turn towards god. A one-hundred- and-eighty-degree turn is needed.</p><p>The first birth is physical. It is nothing special: animals are also
born, trees are also born. But for man there is a possibility of a
second birth, the spiritual birth. That's what sannyas is all about.
When one surrenders to a master one is reborn. That rebirth is real
birth. In the East we call it twice-born or well-born.</p><p>With this birth life really starts; before it was only a kind of
sleep. This is the first step towards awakening. Now much more has to be
done. It is an arduous, long journey, but full of great blessings, great
benedictions, great joys, ecstasies, adventures, thrills; at each step
there are thrills, at each step there are surprises waiting for you. But
great effort is needed, perseverance is needed. It is like digging a
well: you will have to remove much earth, rocks, and only then slowly
slowly will you reach the sources of water.</p><p>They are there, but much has to be removed first.</p><p>God is within you, but much has become accumulated around your being;
that has to be removed, chunk by chunk. It hurts too, it is painful, but
whenever a chunk is removed you feel a new weightlessness arising, new
wings growing. And when all this garbage is dropped you are born
anew.</p><p>That is our effort, to help people to be reborn, to be pure beings,
to be Buddhas. It is everybody's right, but one has to claim it. It is
not just given, you have to prepare yourself, you have to get ready for
it. The moment you are ready, the host is ready, the guest arrives.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=scriptures-in-silence-and-sermons-in-stones>Scriptures in Silence

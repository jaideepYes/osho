It is for reference purposes only.]\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nHolly has two meanings; one is holy, sacred, spiritual. It is a beautiful word but it has very wrong associations. It has the smell of holier-than-thou, it has some subtle egoistic flavour to it. The word in itself is beautiful; it comes from whole, the total. To be holy means to be whole. That's my whole approach, my messages be whole and you will be holy.\nBut for centuries the word has been in the wrong hands. The church has destroyed its beauty, the so-called saints have polluted its meaning. It has become poisoned. Even beautiful words in wrong hands become ugly, and ugly words in right hands become beautiful. It all depends on who is using them.\nThe second meaning is far more beautiful. The second meaning is English; the\nfirst is Anglo-Saxon. The English meaning is... it is a name of an evergreen tree. I like that more.\nLove is an evergreen tree, always young and always fresh; it never grows old. Time does not affect it, time leaves no traces on it. Love is non-temporal, it is beyond time. The moment you enter love you enter eternity, and god is an ever- green tree.\nRemember both meanings; but the first has become contaminated, the second is still pure. Love has both qualities: love makes you whole and makes you holy, and love takes you beyond time; hence it is evergreen.\nIt is never old, it never dies, it knows no death.\nThe people who are afraid of death are people who have not known love. Lovers are never afraid of death. They have known something beyond death. Once you have known something beyond death, who cares about death? You know that you will be. The body will be gone, the mind will be gone, but not you; you are transcendental. Even through the fire of death your evergreenness is not going to be destroyed, it is going to abide.\nLove is always protected by god. Only those who are not in love are unprotected; those who are not in love are always in insecurity. The moment you enter love, you enter absolute security, safety, because love is another name of god and god is protection. That is one of the greatest insights of the mystics.\nThe ordinary man lives in fear, anxiety. He tries to protect himself, hence he becomes very tense. The problems are too big and his hands are too small. The moment he loves existence, the moment he surrenders to existence. That's what love is: a deep, total surrender to that which is, a deep let-go. In that very moment all anxiety disappears, fear disappears, tensions wither away. Then you are part of the cosmos, and immediately the feeling arises: I am protected, god is always surrounding me. Now there is no death.\nOnce god is known, tasted, death disappears. Death exists only for those who have not known love.\nThose who have known love are beyond death.\nLove is divine, lust is animal. And between lust and love there is something, a\nmixture of both, which is human.\nHuman love is neither love nor lust, it is both: hence it has all the darkness of lust and all the brightness of love. It has all the jealousies, possessivenesses, anger, hatred, of lust, and it has all the poetry, all the beauty, all the joy of love. Man is torn apart between these two -- the body and the soul, the animal and god.\nIf one does not work upon oneself deliberately, consciously, one is easily pulled downwards, because we have a long long past of lust. Love is only in poetry, lust is in every cell of our body. Lust is our past, love is our future; and the past is very big, it has tremendous weight -- it can pull you very easily. The past is habit, memory, experience -- that's all we have known. One has to be very alert to go beyond lust. And one has to be constantly aware of jealousy, of possessiveness, of domination, because those are the strategies of lust. If you drop jealousy, possessiveness, ego trips, then slowly slowly lust disappears and love arises.\nLove is a pure flame without any smoke. It is prayer, it is divine, and it makes you divine.\nIn ancient times the wolf represented loyalty and courage -- and these are two qualities which are always found together, Without courage you cannot be loyal and without being loyal you cannot grow in courage.\nBoth qualities are needed for bliss to happen, one needs to be courageous enough to go into the unknown, and loyal enough, trusting enough in existence, in god, not thinking of oneself as a stranger, an outsider, but trusting that \"I am part of the whole and the whole is always with me.\" Only then, with such trust and courage, can one open up to bliss. And bliss is such a tremendous phenomenon that it is not possible with a cowardly heart, it is not possible with a cowardly heart, it is not possible with a deceiving mind.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nBliss means the ocean descending into the dewdrop. One has to be really open to take in the whole sky.\nAnd it is a death because the dewdrop will disappear; courage and trust are needed because you can't know what is going to happen after this death. Much trust is needed so that you can visualize a resurrection, so that death will only take away the non-essential from you, so that surrender will be the surrender of the non-essential and the essential will evolve, will grow. All the hindrances in its path will be removed by surrender.\nBliss is possible, but let those two qualities be there -- not in a calculative way: innocently, be courageous and trusting.\nBe a friend to existence, to all that is, and you will be blissful. Bliss is the reward for being friendly to all.\nWe are brought up in such a way that all possibilities of friendliness are destroyed. On the contrary, we are taught to be enemies of each other; our whole education depends on competition, and competition is enmity, competition is jealousy, competition is envy.\nYes, formally we show great friendship, courtesy, culture, but that is all formal. Deep down we are all enemies of each other, ready to kill each other if needed, trying to use each other as a means, reducing everybody to just a stepping stone for your ego trip.\nOur society destroys friendship, it creates a very ugly world, There is a constant underground war going on, a cold war: it does not always surface but it remains there. It has to be changed, then only does a person become religious.\nReally be a friend. There is no need to compete, no need to be jealous, no need to be envious. God has given you enough, more than you will ever need. Be thankful for that! And open your heart to friendship.\nBecome a host to the whole existence -- to the trees, to the birds, to the rocks. Create an atmosphere around you, a climate of friendship, and bliss is yours. Then nobody can prevent it from happening.\nPeace is always victorious, it knows no defeat. But to be peaceful is very difficult, arduous, it needs a total transformation of your interiority.\nWar is easy, fight is easy, violence is easy. Nature has given us all those qualities already, we are born with them. But peace is something which has to be created. Out of violence peace has to be created. That's the whole work of spiritual transformation, of alchemy: from poison, nectar has to be created.\nIn the beginning it looks almost impossible -- how can nectar come out of poison? But in the right hands, in the hands of a physician poison becomes nectar. And in the hands of a stupid person even nectar may prove to be poisonous, It all depends on how you use your energies, on how you use your natural endowments. If you use them in their crude form they are ugly. They are like raw diamonds direct from the mine, only a jeweller may be able to see something of beauty in them, otherwise they are just ordinary stones. Before everybody can recognize the beauty, they have to be polished, cut.\nThe greatest diamond in the world is the kohinoor. It was found in a mine in India, in the mines of Golconda. It remained with a poor man for three years. His children were playing with it, thinking it was just an ordinary, good-looking colourful stone. And the man remained poor. Nobody was aware... It was a visitor who told the man, \"This is the rarest diamond I have ever seen in my life -\n- what are you doing with it? Your children are playing with it!\"\nNow it is in the crown of the British Queen, although its size and weight are no more the same: it is one-third of the original. Two-thirds have been cut away; the more it has been cut, the more valuable it has become. The weight is less, the value is more.\nAnd that's exactly the case with human beings: we are raw diamonds, great polishing is needed. And we have to learn the art of how to change the ugly into the beautiful.\nThat's what sannyas is all about: it is learning a very subtle skill, a craft, an art, the most precious art.\nNothing can be more valuable than this, because you will be transforming your own energies. Slowly slowly, through meditations, through prayer, through silence, through love, through song, through music, through dance, you will be changing your inner qualities. One day the very poison of violence becomes peace. And peace is victorious, and peace is divine, God has entered you. Peace means that god has entered you, peace means that god has chosen you as his\nvehicle -- and that is victory.\nTo be chosen by god as a vehicle. Nothing can be more important than that.\nGod is always new. You cannot say that god was, the past tense is irrelevant. You cannot say that god 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nwill be, the future tense is irrelevant. You can only say that god is. Only the present tense is relevant because god is in the present, always. Now is his quality; here is his space. The moment you also become now-here, you start experiencing the newness of the whole existence. It is continuously bathed in newness.\nExcept for man's mind nothing ever gets old; only man's mind accumulates memory and becomes old. It is through memory that aging happens.\nA meditator comes to know how to put the mind aside, The moment he can see himself separate from the mind he is no longer old, no longer of the past, he is no longer memory. And then great freshness explodes. The joy and the thrill and the bliss of it is indescribable.\nThere are two kinds of sounds: one is that which is created by the clash of two things.… That's how we produce sound on musical instruments, that's how we speak; it is a clash. There is another sound which is heard in deep silence, at the innermost core of your being. You don't produce it, you simply hear it; you discover it. It has always been there. That is called the soundless sound. That is the sound of one hand clapping -- that is nadamo.\nAnd this is going to be your work: you have to hear that which cannot be heard, you have to see that which cannot be seen, you have to grasp the ungraspable, to conceive the inconceivable, to know the unknowable. That's the enquiry, the fundamental enquiry of a seeker. That enquiry makes you a sannyasin.\nShunyo means nothingness, emptiness, void. It is Buddha's word for your\ninnermost core.\nAt the very core of our being there is nothing, just a pure emptiness. Because of this emptiness we are afraid to go in. Buddhas go on saying to people, \"Go in.\" People hear them but nobody follows, people worship them but nobody follows.\nPeople say, \"You must be right but our time has not come yet.\" The fundamental reason is that people are afraid of going in. Somehow unconsciously they feel that the experience is going to be too much, it may prove unbearable. And they are right: the experience is tremendous, it is unbearable. It kills you as you are and gives you a birth. A new being arrives, the old completely disappears. For the old it is really drastic, it is death. But the old is not worth keeping. It is ugly and it is the source of all kinds of miseries and nightmares.\nIt is good that it dies. On its death a new being arises. But before the new can arrive, the old has to go. For the new to be, the old has to cease.\nSannyas is a death and a resurrection.\nSanatano means the eternal one; one who has always been, is and will be, one who is unchanging.\nChanges happen but nothing affects you. Things come and go, you remain the same... like the sky, clouds come and go; days come and nights come; in the day it is sunny and there is light, and in the night it is dark and there are so many stars; and sometimes it is cloudy and sometimes there is not a single cloud.\nBut the sky remains the same, unaffected, untouched.\nThat's exactly the quality of god, like the sky. And that is the quality of your inner being too -- because we participate in god, our consciousness is part of him. We are not separate from him, we are absolutely one with him.\nMeditation is a discovery of this eternal element in your being. Once you have known this eternal element in your being you know that it is everywhere, in everything. That day becomes a day of great blessings. After that there is no misery, no pain, no agony, no nightmare, you are awakened.\nTo know the eternal is to be awakened. To know the eternal is to be enlightened. To know the eternal is to be a Buddha, is to be a Christ.\nScriptures in Silence and Sermons in Stones Chapter #33\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2496","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/scriptures_in_silence_and_sermons_in_stone/part32/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/scriptures_in_silence_and_sermons_in_stone/>Scriptures In Silence And Sermons In Stone</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>12 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2496 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Scriptures_In_Silence_And_Sermons_In_Stone/part32.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part31>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

really open to take in the whole sky.</p><p>And it is a death because the dewdrop will disappear; courage and
trust are needed because you can't know what is going to happen after
this death. Much trust is needed so that you can visualize a
resurrection, so that death will only take away the non-essential from
you, so that surrender will be the surrender of the non-essential and
the essential will evolve, will grow. All the hindrances in its path
will be removed by surrender.</p><p>Bliss is possible, but let those two qualities be there -- not in a
calculative way: innocently, be courageous and trusting.</p><p>Be a friend to existence, to all that is, and you will be blissful.
Bliss is the reward for being friendly to all.</p><p>We are brought up in such a way that all possibilities of
friendliness are destroyed. On the contrary, we are taught to be enemies
of each other; our whole education depends on competition, and
competition is enmity, competition is jealousy, competition is envy.</p><p>Yes, formally we show great friendship, courtesy, culture, but that
is all formal. Deep down we are all enemies of each other, ready to kill
each other if needed, trying to use each other as a means, reducing
everybody to just a stepping stone for your ego trip.</p><p>Our society destroys friendship, it creates a very ugly world, There
is a constant underground war going on, a cold war: it does not always
surface but it remains there. It has to be changed, then only does a
person become religious.</p><p>Really be a friend. There is no need to compete, no need to be
jealous, no need to be envious. God has given you enough, more than you
will ever need. Be thankful for that! And open your heart to
friendship.</p><p>Become a host to the whole existence -- to the trees, to the birds,
to the rocks. Create an atmosphere around you, a climate of friendship,
and bliss is yours. Then nobody can prevent it from happening.</p><p>Peace is always victorious, it knows no defeat. But to be peaceful is
very difficult, arduous, it needs a total transformation of your
interiority.</p><p>War is easy, fight is easy, violence is easy. Nature has given us all
those qualities already, we are born with them. But peace is something
which has to be created. Out of violence peace has to be created. That's
the whole work of spiritual transformation, of alchemy: from poison,
nectar has to be created.</p><p>In the beginning it looks almost impossible -- how can nectar come
out of poison? But in the right hands, in the hands of a physician
poison becomes nectar. And in the hands of a stupid person even nectar
may prove to be poisonous, It all depends on how you use your energies,
on how you use your natural endowments. If you use them in their crude
form they are ugly. They are like raw diamonds direct from the mine,
only a jeweller may be able to see something of beauty in them,
otherwise they are just ordinary stones. Before everybody can recognize
the beauty, they have to be polished, cut.</p><p>The greatest diamond in the world is the kohinoor. It was found in a
mine in India, in the mines of Golconda. It remained with a poor man for
three years. His children were playing with it, thinking it was just an
ordinary, good-looking colourful stone. And the man remained poor.
Nobody was aware... It was a visitor who told the man, "This is the
rarest diamond I have ever seen in my life -</p><p>- what are you doing with it? Your children are playing with it!"</p><p>Now it is in the crown of the British Queen, although its size and
weight are no more the same: it is one-third of the original. Two-thirds
have been cut away; the more it has been cut, the more valuable it has
become. The weight is less, the value is more.</p><p>And that's exactly the case with human beings: we are raw diamonds,
great polishing is needed. And we have to learn the art of how to change
the ugly into the beautiful.</p><p>That's what sannyas is all about: it is learning a very subtle skill,
a craft, an art, the most precious art.</p><p>Nothing can be more valuable than this, because you will be
transforming your own energies. Slowly slowly, through meditations,
through prayer, through silence, through love, through song, through
music, through dance, you will be changing your inner qualities. One day
the very poison of violence becomes peace. And peace is victorious, and
peace is divine, God has entered you. Peace means that god has entered
you, peace means that god has chosen you as his</p><p>vehicle -- and that is victory.</p><p>To be chosen by god as a vehicle. Nothing can be more important than
that.</p><p>God is always new. You cannot say that god was, the past tense is
irrelevant. You cannot say that god 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>will be, the future tense is irrelevant. You can only say that god
is. Only the present tense is relevant because god is in the present,
always. Now is his quality; here is his space. The moment you also
become now-here, you start experiencing the newness of the whole
existence. It is continuously bathed in newness.</p><p>Except for man's mind nothing ever gets old; only man's mind
accumulates memory and becomes old. It is through memory that aging
happens.</p><p>A meditator comes to know how to put the mind aside, The moment he
can see himself separate from the mind he is no longer old, no longer of
the past, he is no longer memory. And then great freshness explodes. The
joy and the thrill and the bliss of it is indescribable.</p><p>There are two kinds of sounds: one is that which is created by the
clash of two things.… That's how we produce sound on musical
instruments, that's how we speak; it is a clash. There is another sound
which is heard in deep silence, at the innermost core of your being. You
don't produce it, you simply hear it; you discover it. It has always
been there. That is called the soundless sound. That is the sound of one
hand clapping -- that is nadamo.</p><p>And this is going to be your work: you have to hear that which cannot
be heard, you have to see that which cannot be seen, you have to grasp
the ungraspable, to conceive the inconceivable, to know the unknowable.
That's the enquiry, the fundamental enquiry of a seeker. That enquiry
makes you a sannyasin.</p><p>Shunyo means nothingness, emptiness, void. It is Buddha's word for
your</p><p>innermost core.</p><p>At the very core of our being there is nothing, just a pure
emptiness. Because of this emptiness we are afraid to go in. Buddhas go
on saying to people, "Go in." People hear them but nobody follows,
people worship them but nobody follows.</p><p>People say, "You must be right but our time has not come yet." The
fundamental reason is that people are afraid of going in. Somehow
unconsciously they feel that the experience is going to be too much, it
may prove unbearable. And they are right: the experience is tremendous,
it is unbearable. It kills you as you are and gives you a birth. A new
being arrives, the old completely disappears. For the old it is really
drastic, it is death. But the old is not worth keeping. It is ugly and
it is the source of all kinds of miseries and nightmares.</p><p>It is good that it dies. On its death a new being arises. But before
the new can arrive, the old has to go. For the new to be, the old has to
cease.</p><p>Sannyas is a death and a resurrection.</p><p>Sanatano means the eternal one; one who has always been, is and will
be, one who is unchanging.</p><p>Changes happen but nothing affects you. Things come and go, you
remain the same... like the sky, clouds come and go; days come and
nights come; in the day it is sunny and there is light, and in the night
it is dark and there are so many stars; and sometimes it is cloudy and
sometimes there is not a single cloud.</p><p>But the sky remains the same, unaffected, untouched.</p><p>That's exactly the quality of god, like the sky. And that is the
quality of your inner being too -- because we participate in god, our
consciousness is part of him. We are not separate from him, we are
absolutely one with him.</p><p>Meditation is a discovery of this eternal element in your being. Once
you have known this eternal element in your being you know that it is
everywhere, in everything. That day becomes a day of great blessings.
After that there is no misery, no pain, no agony, no nightmare, you are
awakened.</p><p>To know the eternal is to be awakened. To know the eternal is to be
enlightened. To know the eternal is to be a Buddha, is to be a
Christ.</p><h3 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=scriptures-in-silence-and-sermons-in-stones>Scriptures in Silence

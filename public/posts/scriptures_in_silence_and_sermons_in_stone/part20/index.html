It is for reference purposes only.]\nSurati Barbara.\nThe beginning of religious consciousness is in the remembrance that we are outsiders here, that we don't belong to the material world, that our home is far away, that we have fallen from some paradise, that we have been expelled. This is what Christians call the original sin, the expulsion from the home.\nThe word \"sin\" is very significant; the root from which it comes means forgetfulness. We have forgotten who we are -- that is our original sin. And because we have forgotten ourselves we have forgotten all that is ours, the inner kingdom of God that is our home. The Garden of Eden is not somewhere else, it is in the innermost center of your being. But one can search for it only when one\nbecomes aware that one is a foreigner, that one is not at home, that one is living in a foreign country, that one cannot belong here, that all is momentary.\nWe are trying our best to settle in time somehow, but nobody can settle in time. The very process of timing is unsettling, it is a flux. We can settle only in eternity, in timelessness, in God. It is a blessing to remember that we don't belong here because then the journey can begin. And sannyas is nothing but a journey towards the real home. It is a homesickness.\nA child was visiting his grandparents. He was very restless and very sad and very depressed. The grandmother asked him, \"Are you feeling homesick?\" He said, \"No, I am feeling here-sick.\" But that's what homesickness is: when you start feeling here-sick then the journey is bound to start, it is inevitable.\nTheodore.\nLife is a gift, birth is a gift, love is a gift, death is a gift. If we know how to appreciate, all is a gift; if we don't know how to appreciate then there is nothing but complaints and complaints in life. There are only two types of people: those who know how to appreciate the beauty of that which is, of that which has been given to them and those who have no sense of appreciation. They are always condemning, complaining, asking for more and more.\nOnly the first kind of people can become religious, the second kind cannot become religious. The second kind is bound to deny God sooner or later, because God becomes an enemy who is not fulfilling your desires. It is these people who have made the proverb \"Man proposes and God disposes.\" The proverb is made by non-religious people. They are always feeling frustrated. whatsoever happens is wrong. It is never up to the mark, it is never fulfilling, never to their heart's content; it is always falling short. They live in misery because there is always a grudge, as if they are deprived of something. How can they feel grateful? And without gratefulness there is no prayer, without prayer there is no religion.\nPrayer is the foundation of religion and it is prayer realized that becomes the experience of God. The seed of prayer is gratitude: feel grateful, because great is the gift of God and it is constantly showering on you, but we start taking it for granted. That is one of the most stupid things that a human being can do, but mind is always doing it: it starts taking things for granted.\nThe sun rises, the dawn has tremendous beauty, but your mind says, \"So what? It\nhappens every day. It is just another morning, just like others.\" The whole east is red with the rising sun and the clouds are full of color, but the mind says, \"So what? It is nothing new. Millions of times it has happened and millions of times it is going to happen again.\"\nIf this is the way of looking at things.… And this is how mind looks at things: it becomes insensitive --\ninsensitive to beauty, insensitive to music, insensitive to poetry, insensitive to love, insensitive to everything that is valuable. The naturally you live in darkness, you live in ugliness. It is your own creation.\nStart feeling grateful. Grow the sense of appreciation. Praise existence for what has already been done and then much more will go on happening to you. The more you praise, the more you become capable of seeing, the more perceptive you become. A prayerful person becomes so perceptive that he sees God everywhere, he finds his signature everywhere: scriptures in silence, sermons in stones.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Jan.\nMillions are his gifts but love is the greatest, for the simple reason that it is through love that all that is significant, valuable, becomes possible. Without love there would be no poetry, no music, no dance, no song; without love there would be nothing valuable in life. Without love life would be just mechanical.\nLove is the only non-mechanical phenomenon; hence the computer can do everything except love. It can do great mathematics. Sooner or later it will be doing all the scientific work. Within a few years the scientist will find himself out of work, unemployed. His own invention will throw him out of his job, because the computer can do things in afar better way, far more efficiently than the scientist himself.\nIt can be very logical, absolutely logical, in fact it can never be illogical. Because man is illogical I say that he is not a machine; his illogicality proves that he is non-mechanical. And the greatest illogical phenomenon in man's life is love. It is beyond all logic, it is beyond all arithmetic. That's why people think that lovers are blind, that they are mad. In a sense they are mad because they are no more functioning through their intellects. They function from a totally different centre of their being.\nLove is the only phenomenon that gives man the dignity of being a non-machine. Other than that, anything that man can do, machines can do in a better way, in a cheaper way, in a quicker way -- only love is impossible. It is inconceivable that two machines could be in love.\nLove is the greatest gift because it is love that makes you really human. But very few people are really loving. And unless you love you will not live your life, you will only drag. Your life will be superficial, stale, dull. You will live and yet you will not live. You will die, but even your death will be dull, because unless you really live how can you really die? Only when a person lives intensely does he die intensely.\nThen life is beautiful and death too. But it is love that makes both life and death beautiful.\nLet love be the only law, the only commandment. And it is enough: if you can fulfil one commandment the other ten commandments will be fulfilled automatically.\nAndy.\nBliss is only for those who are courageous, daring, brave, because bliss happens only when you have moved beyond the known into the unknown. Whenever you become confined to the known your life becomes routine, repetitive. It goes on moving in the same rut, it goes around in circles, and slowly slowly it dulls all your sensitivities, all your receptivities. It harden people. It makes them blind, it makes them deaf, it makes them dumb, because there is nothing to see and nothing to hear and nothing to taste and nothing to feel. They have known it all; it is the same repetition. How can there be bliss in such a life? Such a life has only one taste -- that of misery, depression, a sadness, a settled sadness.\nBut if one is courageous enough to move continuously from the known into the\nunknown, from the familiar into the unfamiliar It is risky, because the familiar\nis secure, safe. And who knows what is going to happen if you go into the unknown, into the uncharted? You take your small boat and you go into the uncharted sea. who knows if you will ever come back to the old shore again? Who can give you a guarantee? There is no guarantee.\nBut unless one is ready to live in such a dangerous state one cannot remain blissful Live dangerously\n-- because life knows no other way: it has to be lived dangerously.\nRemember that as one of the most fundamental qualities of a religious life -- particularly the way I see religion. For the sannyasin courage is the greatest virtue. and then bliss goes on happening: you need not seek or search for it, it is a by-product of a courageous life. If one is ready to live dangerously many flowers of bliss are going to bloom.\nChitprem means conscious love.\nOrdinarily love is unconscious, it is instinctive; hence it is not love but lust. Unless we transform our love into a conscious phenomenon it is not really love. and to make love conscious takes great effort. That effort is meditation: meditation is the process of changing love into a conscious phenomenon.\nBecome more alert to everything in your life. Only then can you ultimately become conscious of your love. Walk consciously, eat consciously. Talk, listen, consciously, with great alertness, intensity, attentiveness. Let attentiveness be spread all over your life, from very small, ordinary acts like taking a bath.\nWhen you can transform these ordinary things into conscious acts then it will be possible to bring consciousness to love energy.\nLove energy is the deepest energy of your being. First transform the circumference, then the center. But the process is the same; the name of the process is awareness of meditation. and that has to be your work: be 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nmeditative. It is meditation that is going to give you a new birth. Satgyan means true knowledge.\nKnowledge borrowed from others is untrue, knowledge gathered from the outside is untrue. It hides your ignorance but it does not make you wise. It covers up your wounds but it does not heal. In a way it is very dangerous because one tends to forget one's wounds, and the wounds go on growing inside; they can become canceric. It is better to know them. It is better to open them to the winds, to the rains, to the sun.\nHiding them is protecting them, and they are your enemies. It is better to let them be exposed -- nature heals. Hence the first step of true knowledge is to know \"I know nothing\"; that is exposing your ignorance.\nAnd from that moment a turning happens, a great change happens: one starts looking inwards.\nTrue knowledge has to happen within you. It can't come through thoughts, it has to come through a thoughtless space within you. It cannot come through studying, it comes through meditation. It comes only when the mind becomes absolutely contentless, so utterly empty and pure, uncontaminated, unpolluted, that your own inner sources start flowing because all the hindrances have been removed.\nThe source from where the spring can flow is there, but there are many rocks in the way, and those rocks are thought to be knowledge. They are not knowledge but enemies of knowledge. Drop all that you have learned from the without so that the within can speak to you, and then you will know the flavor of true knowledge, knowing. True knowing liberates.\nGyanprem.\nThat's exactly the meaning of philosophy -- love of knowing, and of a philosopher -- a lover of truth, a lover of knowledge. The only thing to be remembered is that knowledge does not consist of accumulating information. It does not consist of learning from others; on the contrary it consists of a process of unlearning. One really becomes a knower when one becomes as innocent as a\nchild again. When the mirror of consciousness is absolutely contentless, when the lake of consciousness has no waves, no ripples even, then the whole sky, the whole existence, is reflected in you in all its glory, in all its beauty, in all its grandeur; and that experience is God.\nBe empty, be still. In fact be not. Be just nothingness so that the whole can descend in you, so that the whole can be reflected by your consciousness. That experience is the only religious experience, the only mystical experience. It gives you a certainty about God, not a belief but absolute certainty. It gives you absolute clarity. God becomes your own experience. It is not that Jesus says so or Buddha says so or I say so, but that you know it. The experience penetrates into your very guts, it becomes part of your being. Only then is the goal achieved and is life fulfilled.\nDeva Stephan means the voice of the divine.\nGod speaks in everyone's heart, but we are so occupied in the head that we never listen to that still, small voice within. There is so much clamoring, chattering, so much unnecessary noise -- we have made the head a marketplace -- that the heart goes on calling and we remain deaf to it. God is not far away, he is very close. All that is needed is the art of making the mind a little silent, a little less noisy, a little more peaceful, relaxed. as the mind settles into relaxation, suddenly you start hearing a divine music within you. God has started playing on the instrument of your heart, on the harp of your heart -- and that music is transforming.\nOnce heard it is never forgotten; once heard life is never the same again; once heard you have become part of immortal existence; you are no more a mortal.\nAnd this is my whole work here: to help you to get out of the mind, to put the mind into deep silence so that the heart can start functioning, to come closer to the heart so that you can hear what its message is.\nAll the Bibles, all the Vedas, all the Gitas, all the Korans, are hidden in your heart. Every heart has all that is worth knowing; one need not go anywhere else.\nLao Tzu says, \"To know truth you need not go outside your room,\" and by room he really means your body. You need not go out of your house -- by house he means your body -- \"You are already provided for.\"\nTruth is our intrinsic heritage, but we go on living in the mind, in dreams and desires and all kinds of stupid ideas, noises. We go on living in that confusion called mind.\nBy becoming a sannyasin you are taking the first step towards the heart, from confusion towards clarity.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nScriptures in Silence and Sermons in Stones Chapter #21\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2566","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/scriptures_in_silence_and_sermons_in_stone/part20/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/scriptures_in_silence_and_sermons_in_stone/>Scriptures In Silence And Sermons In Stone</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>13 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2566 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Scriptures_In_Silence_And_Sermons_In_Stone/part20.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part19>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

reason that it is through love that all that is significant, valuable,
becomes possible. Without love there would be no poetry, no music, no
dance, no song; without love there would be nothing valuable in life.
Without love life would be just mechanical.</p><p>Love is the only non-mechanical phenomenon; hence the computer can do
everything except love. It can do great mathematics. Sooner or later it
will be doing all the scientific work. Within a few years the scientist
will find himself out of work, unemployed. His own invention will throw
him out of his job, because the computer can do things in afar better
way, far more efficiently than the scientist himself.</p><p>It can be very logical, absolutely logical, in fact it can never be
illogical. Because man is illogical I say that he is not a machine; his
illogicality proves that he is non-mechanical. And the greatest
illogical phenomenon in man's life is love. It is beyond all logic, it
is beyond all arithmetic. That's why people think that lovers are blind,
that they are mad. In a sense they <em>are</em> mad because they are no
more functioning through their intellects. They function from a totally
different centre of their being.</p><p>Love is the only phenomenon that gives man the dignity of being a
non-machine. Other than that, anything that man can do, machines can do
in a better way, in a cheaper way, in a quicker way -- only love is
impossible. It is inconceivable that two machines could be in love.</p><p>Love is the greatest gift because it is love that makes you really
human. But very few people are really loving. And unless you love you
will not live your life, you will only drag. Your life will be
superficial, stale, dull. You will live and yet you will not live. You
will die, but even your death will be dull, because unless you
<em>really</em> live how can you really die? Only when a person lives
intensely does he die intensely.</p><p>Then life is beautiful and death too. But it is love that makes both
life and death beautiful.</p><p>Let love be the only law, the only commandment. And it is enough: if
you can fulfil one commandment the other ten commandments will be
fulfilled automatically.</p><p>Andy.</p><p>Bliss is only for those who are courageous, daring, brave, because
bliss happens only when you have moved beyond the known into the
unknown. Whenever you become confined to the known your life becomes
routine, repetitive. It goes on moving in the same rut, it goes around
in circles, and slowly slowly it dulls all your sensitivities, all your
receptivities. It harden people. It makes them blind, it makes them
deaf, it makes them dumb, because there is nothing to see and nothing to
hear and nothing to taste and nothing to feel. They have known it all;
it is the same repetition. How can there be bliss in such a life? Such a
life has only one taste -- that of misery, depression, a sadness, a
settled sadness.</p><p>But if one is courageous enough to move continuously from the known
into the</p><p>unknown, from the familiar into the unfamiliar It is risky, because
the familiar</p><p>is secure, safe. And who knows what is going to happen if you go into
the unknown, into the uncharted? You take your small boat and you go
into the uncharted sea. who knows if you will ever come back to the old
shore again? Who can give you a guarantee? There is no guarantee.</p><p>But unless one is ready to live in such a dangerous state one cannot
remain blissful Live dangerously</p><p>-- because life knows no other way: it has to be lived
dangerously.</p><p>Remember that as one of the most fundamental qualities of a religious
life -- particularly the way I see religion. For the sannyasin courage
is the greatest virtue. and then bliss goes on happening: you need not
seek or search for it, it is a by-product of a courageous life. If one
is ready to live dangerously many flowers of bliss are going to
bloom.</p><p>Chitprem means conscious love.</p><p>Ordinarily love is unconscious, it is instinctive; hence it is not
love but lust. Unless we transform our love into a conscious phenomenon
it is not really love. and to make love conscious takes great effort.
That effort is meditation: meditation is the process of changing love
into a conscious phenomenon.</p><p>Become more alert to everything in your life. Only then can you
ultimately become conscious of your love. Walk consciously, eat
consciously. Talk, listen, consciously, with great alertness, intensity,
attentiveness. Let attentiveness be spread all over your life, from very
small, ordinary acts like taking a bath.</p><p>When you can transform these ordinary things into conscious acts then
it will be possible to bring consciousness to love energy.</p><p>Love energy is the deepest energy of your being. First transform the
circumference, then the center. But the process is the same; the name of
the process is awareness of meditation. and that has to be your work: be

Satgyan means true knowledge.</p><p>Knowledge borrowed from others is untrue, knowledge gathered from the
outside is untrue. It hides your ignorance but it does not make you
wise. It covers up your wounds but it does not heal. In a way it is very
dangerous because one tends to forget one's wounds, and the wounds go on
growing inside; they can become canceric. It is better to know them. It
is better to open them to the winds, to the rains, to the sun.</p><p>Hiding them is protecting them, and they are your enemies. It is
better to let them be exposed -- nature heals. Hence the first step of
true knowledge is to know "I know nothing"; that is exposing your
ignorance.</p><p>And from that moment a turning happens, a great change happens: one
starts looking inwards.</p><p>True knowledge has to happen within you. It can't come through
thoughts, it has to come through a thoughtless space within you. It
cannot come through studying, it comes through meditation. It comes only
when the mind becomes absolutely contentless, so utterly empty and pure,
uncontaminated, unpolluted, that your own inner sources start flowing
because all the hindrances have been removed.</p><p>The source from where the spring can flow is there, but there are
many rocks in the way, and those rocks are thought to be knowledge. They
are not knowledge but enemies of knowledge. Drop all that you have
learned from the without so that the within can speak to you, and then
you will know the flavor of true knowledge, knowing. True knowing
liberates.</p><p>Gyanprem.</p><p>That's exactly the meaning of philosophy -- love of knowing, and of a
philosopher -- a lover of truth, a lover of knowledge. The only thing to
be remembered is that knowledge does not consist of accumulating
information. It does not consist of learning from others; on the
contrary it consists of a process of unlearning. One really becomes a
knower when one becomes as innocent as a</p><p>child again. When the mirror of consciousness is absolutely
contentless, when the lake of consciousness has no waves, no ripples
even, then the whole sky, the whole existence, is reflected in you in
all its glory, in all its beauty, in all its grandeur; and that
experience is God.</p><p>Be empty, be still. In fact be not. Be just nothingness so that the
whole can descend in you, so that the whole can be reflected by your
consciousness. That experience is the only religious experience, the
only mystical experience. It gives you a certainty about God, not a
belief but absolute certainty. It gives you absolute clarity. God
becomes your own experience. It is not that Jesus says so or Buddha says
so or I say so, but that you know it. The experience penetrates into
your very guts, it becomes part of your being. Only then is the goal
achieved and is life fulfilled.</p><p>Deva Stephan means the voice of the divine.</p><p>God speaks in everyone's heart, but we are so occupied in the head
that we never listen to that still, small voice within. There is so much
clamoring, chattering, so much unnecessary noise -- we have made the
head a marketplace -- that the heart goes on calling and we remain deaf
to it. God is not far away, he is very close. All that is needed is the
art of making the mind a little silent, a little less noisy, a little
more peaceful, relaxed. as the mind settles into relaxation, suddenly
you start hearing a divine music within you. God has started playing on
the instrument of your heart, on the harp of your heart -- and that
music is transforming.</p><p>Once heard it is never forgotten; once heard life is never the same
again; once heard you have become part of immortal existence; you are no
more a mortal.</p><p>And this is my whole work here: to help you to get out of the mind,
to put the mind into deep silence so that the heart can start
functioning, to come closer to the heart so that you can hear what its
message is.</p><p>All the Bibles, all the Vedas, all the Gitas, all the Korans, are
hidden in your heart. Every heart has all that is worth knowing; one
need not go anywhere else.</p><p>Lao Tzu says, "To know truth you need not go outside your room," and
by room he really means your body. You need not go out of your house --
by house he means your body -- "You are already provided for."</p><p>Truth is our intrinsic heritage, but we go on living in the mind, in
dreams and desires and all kinds of stupid ideas, noises. We go on
living in that confusion called mind.</p><p>By becoming a sannyasin you are taking the first step towards the
heart, from confusion towards clarity.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on

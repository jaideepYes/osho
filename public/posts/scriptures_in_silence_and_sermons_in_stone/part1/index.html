It is for reference purposes only.]\nOsho (to Kirsten): Christ says God is love. God is not known to us. God is absolutely unknown. When we utter the word \"god\" it is hollow, empty, because we have not experienced anything of God. But the word \"love\" is full of meaning; it is warm.\nThere is something in love which has been experencied by everybody. It may not be in its purest form, it may be much adultered -- but whater is water even though it is muddy, and love is love even though it is full of lust. Something of the divine remains always present in it. Howsoever dark the night is, a ray of light is still light and not darkness. So it is the case with love.\nLove more and you will be coming closer and closer to the understanding of Christ-consciousness. By being a Christian nothing is achieved, one simply follow a dead dogma. But by being a lover something certainly opens up, your heart starts growing. And when the heart blooms in its absolute glory you are Christ.\nI am not here to create Christians but to create Christs; my effort is not to make Buddhists but Buddhas.\n(to Cristine): Love is the ultimate state of feeling. We live in the world of thoughts, in thinking, and we are so engrossed in thinking that we have completely forgotten the language of feeling. Love is the essence of feeling. One has to learn how not think and how to feel.\nThink less and feel more. Use logic less, use emotion more. If you use logic and thinking, at the most you can communicate with human beings, and that too on a superficial level. You can't be logical with a child who does not know language yet. What do you do with a child? You relate with the child through feelings, through love.\nYou cannot relate with the trees through logic; but there are ways to relate with trees. If you can become open, if you can feel the being of the tree, if you can feel the texture of the tree, if you can hug the tree, if you can close your eyes and simply feel its being, you will be contacting it on a totally different plane. Then even rocks start speaking to you; then the whole existence is alive, suddenly alive. It comes alive, it is no more dead. That life is Christ-consciousness. In the East we call it Buddhahood. Christ and Buddha are synonymous. They are not confined to persons, remember, they are states of being.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nMan can live on three levels; man is a three-tiered being. The most superficial is thinking and the deepest is being; between the two is feeling -- so feeling is the bridge. From thinking move to feeling -- that is love; and from love move to being. The thinking and feeling all disappear because you are no more a separate entity, you become one with the whole. That's when one becomes a Christ.\nIt is of no use to follow anybody. The real thing is to love Christ, to love Buddha, to love Zarathustra --\nnot as followers, but as fellow-travelers because it is the same pilgrimage, the same journey, you will be passing through the same places that Jesus passed through before he became a Christ.\nThe greatest thing in becoming a Christ is the movement from thinking to love; then the second step is very easy. The first step is more difficult because we have lived in thinking for so long that we have become identified with our minds. If we can get out of the mind -- and that's what meditation is all about -- and enter the heart, then the second step is very simple, at any moment one can easily slip from the heart into being.\nAnd to be is to be a Christ, to be is to be a Buddha -- just to be.\n(to Bianca): Love is pure when there are not conditions in it, when it is unconditional, when there is no demand, no expectation, no begging, no bargaining, no business. When you simply give out of the sheer joy of giving, you don't expect even a thank you, then love is pure. And pure love is prayer.\nPure love is the closest phenomenon to God. One who knows what pure love is, is bound to know what God is. Love will make you aware that the whole of existence is full of godliness. When the heart is full of love, existence is full of God; when the heart is loveless, existence is godless. God is missing in existence when love is missing in the heart. There is a syncronicity between love and God. Love has to be your preparation, and then God is the answer of the whole of existence. To the loving heart only God is; everuthing starts turning into godhood. Then there are scriptures in silence and sermons in stones.\nBut the basic thing is to be loving for the sake of love.\n(to Lorna): Love is victory but it is a very strange victory: it is victory through surrender, it is not victory through conquering. It is not ordinary victory. The ordinary victory is violent: you have to defeat the other, you have to dominate the other, you have to enforce yourself upon the other.\nThe ordinary victory can keep the other's body captive but cannot reach the other's soul. You can destroy the body but the soul remains unconquerable; even in death the soul can remain free ... it does remain free.\nBut love knows a totally different way of being victorious: it is through surrender, it is through let-go.\nTo be victorious through surrender is a paradox; but life is full of paradoxes, that is its mistery. It is not simple mathematics, otherwise science would have been able to discover all that is there. But science can never discover all; something,\nthe most essential, will always go on being missed. Science will discover the peripheral but the central will be unavaible to science. It is possible only through religion because religion accepts the paradox, it accepts the mysterious. and the most mysterious phenomenon is victory through surrender.\nSurrender means dropping the ego. When you drop the ego in relation to someone you become victorious within. When you drop the ego in the context of the whole you become victorious with the whole.\nIn the East we have created many schools of mistery. One of the greatest, one of the ancientmost, was created by the Jainas. The very word \"jaina\" means the victorious one, one who has conquered. But to conquer you have to learn how to be conquered by the whole, how to be available to the whole, how to be at the service of the whole, how to efface yourself so totally that you are no more there but God's will is done through you. That is the greatest moment in life -- when you disappear and God appears in you. That is the most victorious moment possible.\nHow long will you be here? Lorna: I don't know.\nBe here as long as possible... or be here forever. Because my place is for people who don't know.\nBliss needs great courage. Any courage can afford misery -- that's why there are so many miserable people. It costs nothing to be miserable, it is not a risk at all. It is very convenient to be miserable; in fact, comfortable to be miserable. It feels secure to be miserable. But to be blissful is dangerous, risky. It is dangerous because it is going into the unknown. It is taking your small boat onto the uncharted sea. One 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nknows nothing of the other shore -- it may be, it may not be. Even if it is, one has no map, one can't be certain that one will ever be able to reach it. The boat is\nsmall, our energies limited, and the ocean is vast. It really needs guts to get into the boat one day and just move, not looking back, not looking at all the securities on this shore.\nThis shore is familiar; altough there is misery we have become familiar with it. We have lived together for so long that it is almost difficult to say goodbye to it. We are \"married\" to misery. It needs great courage to divorce misery because it is divorcing the known, the familiar, the accustomed, the conventional. It is divorcing that which nobody else is divorcing. The whole crowd is living in it. One has to learn how to be alone; for miles and miles there is nobody. One has to learn how to be alone; hence bliss needs courage, the courage to die to the past and be reborn.\nSannyas is a great leap into the unknown. Gather yourself together for a great journey. Yes, there is risk but with risk is life. Yes, there is insecurity but insecurity is adventure. Yes, there is danger but with danger millions of thrills arise, and you are always in for a surprise because you are moving into unknown territory.\nDanger is there, risk is there, but boredom -- never. In hell you will have great company. The path to heaven is of deep aloneness.\nRemember it, because entering onto the path is a momentous phenomenon. Buddha used to say that to enter into the river -- \"srotaapanna\", that was his word -- to enter into the river that is going to the ocean is risky, dangerous. But those who dare are the blessed ones. Once you enter the river sooner or later you will reach the ocean.\nThis is entering the river.\nBliss is not something that you can think about; you cannot philosophize about it. There is no way to speculate about it, and whatsoever you think about it is going to be wrong. It is an existential experience. It is just as a blind man cannot think anything about light. Unless his eyes are cured he will never know what light is. He can go on guessing, inferring, listening to great dialogues on light, reading books on light, talking to people about light, accumulating great information and knowledge about light -- but still he will not have any glimpse of what it is. The only way to know light is to open your eyes and see it.\nThat exactly, precisely the case with bliss: one has to experience it. One has to\nprepare oneself for the great experience. Meditation simply prepares the ground, it helps you to open your eyes, it is medicinal.\nAnd once your eyes are cured you know what it is.\nMany times many people asked Buddha \"What is bliss?\" and he would always say \"Just be with me and be silent for a few months, a few years, and whenever you are right, ripe, mature enough to know it, I will tell you.\" Many stayed with him and he would never tell them what it was. One day he would ask them\n\"Now do you want to know what bliss is?\" And they would say \"It can't be said, but we ourselves know we are grateful that you tricked us into bliss. You never said anything about it but you helped us to be silent, to be still.\"\nWhen you are silent and still something wells up within you -- that is bliss. It is your innermost nature.\nBut remember it is an experience; it is not a theory, it is not a dogma, it is not contained in any scriptures.\nThough it is written all over existence, on each leaf of a tree, on each pebble on the seashore, you will only be able to see it when you have experienced it in the innermost shrine of your being. Then you will see it everywhere. Then the whole existence is made of bliss and nothing else.\nLet bliss be a song that resounds in you.\nMy sannyasin has to be a song of bliss. My sannyasin is not entering into a sad, monastic life; on the contrary he is entering into a life of rejoincing. God is not against life so there is no need to renounce life to attain God; in fact to renounce life is to renounce God forever. Those who renounce life will never find God anywhere because he is always here and now. He is in the thick of life, in its colors, in its days and in its nights.\nGod is nothing but the name of the totality, that which is. Renouncing life is going against God.\nRenouncing life will make you more egoistic. The ego is always sad: it has a long face, it is very serious. It is never joyful, it has no sense of humor. It cannot laugh, it cannot dance, it cannot sing, it cannot love, it cannot live. It is suicidal,\nit wants to die. Slowly slowly it commits suicide. That's what has been done down the ages by the escapists who renounced life and went to the monasteries or into the caves.\nI am against renounciation. Ma sannyas is a tremendous love affair with life. So become a song of bliss, 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\na dance of bliss, a celebration.\nScriptures in Silence and Sermons in Stones Chapter #2\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2319","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/scriptures_in_silence_and_sermons_in_stone/part1/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/scriptures_in_silence_and_sermons_in_stone/>Scriptures In Silence And Sermons In Stone</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>11 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2319 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Scriptures_In_Silence_And_Sermons_In_Stone/part1.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=_index>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

is for people who don't know.</p><p>Bliss needs great courage. Any courage can afford misery -- that's
why there are so many miserable people. It costs nothing to be
miserable, it is not a risk at all. It is very convenient to be
miserable; in fact, comfortable to be miserable. It feels secure to be
miserable. But to be blissful is dangerous, risky. It is dangerous
because it is going into the unknown. It is taking your small boat onto
the uncharted sea. One 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on

it is, one has no map, one can't be certain that one will ever be able
to reach it. The boat is</p><p>small, our energies limited, and the ocean is vast. It really needs
guts to get into the boat one day and just move, not looking back, not
looking at all the securities on this shore.</p><p>This shore is familiar; altough there is misery we have become
familiar with it. We have lived together for so long that it is almost
difficult to say goodbye to it. We are "married" to misery. It needs
great courage to divorce misery because it is divorcing the known, the
familiar, the accustomed, the conventional. It is divorcing that which
nobody else is divorcing. The whole crowd is living in it. One has to
learn how to be alone; for miles and miles there is nobody. One has to
learn how to be alone; hence bliss needs courage, the courage to die to
the past and be reborn.</p><p>Sannyas is a great leap into the unknown. Gather yourself together
for a great journey. Yes, there is risk but with risk is life. Yes,
there is insecurity but insecurity is adventure. Yes, there is danger
but with danger millions of thrills arise, and you are always in for a
surprise because you are moving into unknown territory.</p><p>Danger is there, risk is there, but boredom -- never. In hell you
will have great company. The path to heaven is of deep aloneness.</p><p>Remember it, because entering onto the path is a momentous
phenomenon. Buddha used to say that to enter into the river --
"srotaapanna", that was his word -- to enter into the river that is
going to the ocean is risky, dangerous. But those who dare are the
blessed ones. Once you enter the river sooner or later you will reach
the ocean.</p><p>This is entering the river.</p><p>Bliss is not something that you can think about; you cannot
philosophize about it. There is no way to speculate about it, and
whatsoever you think about it is going to be wrong. It is an existential
experience. It is just as a blind man cannot think anything about light.
Unless his eyes are cured he will never know what light is. He can go on
guessing, inferring, listening to great dialogues on light, reading
books on light, talking to people about light, accumulating great
information and knowledge about light -- but still he will not have any
glimpse of what it is. The only way to know light is to open your eyes
and see it.</p><p>That exactly, precisely the case with bliss: one has to experience
it. One has to</p><p>prepare oneself for the great experience. Meditation simply prepares
the ground, it helps you to open your eyes, it is medicinal.</p><p>And once your eyes are cured you know what it is.</p><p>Many times many people asked Buddha "What is bliss?" and he would
always say "Just be with me and be silent for a few months, a few years,
and whenever you are right, ripe, mature enough to know it, I will tell
you." Many stayed with him and he would never tell them what it was. One
day he would ask them</p><p>"Now do you want to know what bliss is?" And they would say "It can't
be said, but we ourselves know we are grateful that you tricked us into
bliss. You never said anything about it but you helped us to be silent,
to be still."</p><p>When you are silent and still something wells up within you -- that
is bliss. It is your innermost nature.</p><p>But remember it is an experience; it is not a theory, it is not a
dogma, it is not contained in any scriptures.</p><p>Though it is written all over existence, on each leaf of a tree, on
each pebble on the seashore, you will only be able to see it when you
have experienced it in the innermost shrine of your being. Then you will
see it everywhere. Then the whole existence is made of bliss and nothing
else.</p><p>Let bliss be a song that resounds in you.</p><p>My sannyasin has to be a song of bliss. My sannyasin is not entering
into a sad, monastic life; on the contrary he is entering into a life of
rejoincing. God is not against life so there is no need to renounce life
to attain God; in fact to renounce life is to renounce God forever.
Those who renounce life will never find God anywhere because he is
always here and now. He is in the thick of life, in its colors, in its
days and in its nights.</p><p>God is nothing but the name of the totality, that which is.
Renouncing life is going against God.</p><p>Renouncing life will make you more egoistic. The ego is always sad:
it has a long face, it is very serious. It is never joyful, it has no
sense of humor. It cannot laugh, it cannot dance, it cannot sing, it
cannot love, it cannot live. It is suicidal,</p><p>it wants to die. Slowly slowly it commits suicide. That's what has
been done down the ages by the escapists who renounced life and went to
the monasteries or into the caves.</p><p>I am against renounciation. Ma sannyas is a tremendous love affair
with life. So become a song of bliss, 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on

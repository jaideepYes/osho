Rupam means 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nbeauty. Bliss is beautiful; in fact the only real beauty comes out of being blissful. It is not of the body, it is of the soul, but it transforms the body too. When one is miserable inside, the body also goes into an ugly form. When one is blissful inside, the body follows like a shadow: it becomes beautiful. The body is a shadow of the soul, the body simply reflects that which is inside us.\nMy sannyasins have to be totally beautiful -- inside, outside, in every possible\nway -- because beauty is divine, beauty is another name for God! How long will you be here?\n(Rupam): About a year.\nThat's very good, Rupam. Good!\nEverybody is potentially a Christ or a Buddha. Feel blessed that god has already given you the seed of the ultimate. All that is needed is to find the right soil and to be ready to die in the soil.\nSannyas is the right soil, and to be with a Master means to be ready to die in him. The moment the seed dies a tree is born. The tree cannot be born without the death of the seed. It is only through death that the new arrives.\nOne who knows this secret of life goes on dying every day, every moment, because then death is the process of renewal, of renewing yourself, of rebirth.\nFeel blessed that Christ is within you. One need not be Christian -that is also one of the meanings of Christoph. One need not be a Christian. Why settle for being a Christian when you can be a christ? Why settle for being a Buddhist when to be a buddha is within your grasp?\nMy suggestion to all of my sannyasins is: never settle for any small thing. Only the ultimate can make you contented and fulfilled.\n(to Moshe) Basically Moshe comes from the Egyptian; the Egyptian form is Moses. The child was saved from the water, hence he was called Moses, the saved one. Moshe is the Hebrew form of Moses.\nBe blissful because we are already saved, from the very beginning we are saved. There is really no way to go astray because all ways lead to God, they can't lead anywhere else. Even those who go astray are simply taking a longer route, that's all. Where else can they go? There is nowhere else, God is everywhere.\nSo you can go south or north or east or west -- or you need not go anywhere. Sit wherever you are: God is there too!\nThe word \"moshe\" has a beautiful fragrance around it. It means that one need not\nbe saved, one is already saved. One needs no savior; God is our savior and because we belong to him we cannot belong to anybody else. Even if we wish and want to, it is impossible -- it is not in the nature of things. Those who say they don't believe in God, they also belong to God. And as far as god is concerned they are all saved. This whole universe is already in the ultimate state: we have just forgotten. We have forgotten that we need not do anything; we have forgotten that we are already there, where we would like to be. we have forgotten that we are already that which we want to be, which we dream about and desire; and we have never been otherwise.\nIn Zen they have a saying: From the very beginning all are saved, all are Buddhas. But deep deep sleep has fallen over us.\nThe function of the Master is not to save you but just to remind you.\nDhyan means meditation. Simon means one who is capable of hearing, one who is capable of listening, rather.\nThere is a difference between hearing and listening. Anybody whose ears are functioning can hear, but unless your heart is also there you can't listen. Simon means listening with deep obedience, listening with deep trust, listening without any thoughts. Because if you have thoughts they will interfere, they will distort.\nThey will change the meanings of the words, they will impose their own ideas. They will only allow you to hear that which your mind wants to be said to you.\nMeditation is the art of listening to existence. The wind is passing through the trees -- listen to it and listen obediently, as if God has called you. God has really called you because the wind belongs to him and the trees belong to him and the sound of the passing wind though the pines is his sound. Listen to the water, the running water, and the sound of it; listen to the clouds and listen to the silence of the night. And in the 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nsame way listen to the noise of the marketplace ... the train passing by. Listen to\neverything with such deep silence that you become capable of not distorting the messages that are arriving every moment. God goes on pouring his messages from everywhere. The leaf falling from the tree is his message.\nLao Tzu became enlightened seeing a dry leaf falling from the tree. He must have been a man of tremendous silence. Just seeing the pale, old, dead leaf falling from the tree he realized that all is momentary, that life is going to end in death, that there is nothing to cling to, nothing worth clinging to, that this life which ends in death is not the true. The leaf became the message of God. In that very moment he became a sannyasin. In that very moment the worthless was renounced. Not that he made a deliberate decision to renounce; that is not needed\n-- the very understanding that life is momentary, that life is futile, that life is meaningless is enough; one starts searching for another kind of life, on another plane. One has been moving outwards, now one starts moving inwards. You have been searching for joy, bliss and have been founding frustration, misery because that's what the outside can give to you. The moment you turn in, the moment you start exploring your interiority, great joy arises.\nMeditation is the art of listening to existence with deep obedience, with such totality that between you and the song of the bird there is no barrier. Then the song of the bird becomes the message of the Buddha.\nThen in every silence there is a scripture; then every moment of life is a contact with the divine. Then on every leaf is God's signature -- and in every stone a beautiful song is asleep, is hidden.\nIf you become silent the hidden starts becoming manifest. You start hearing things which are not heard ordinarily and you start seeing thing which are not seen ordinarily, as if new eyes were growing in you, new ears were growing in you.\nAnd the definition of meditation is also the definition of the disciple: the art of listening to the master.\nSo really be a Simon!\nCrucify the head, crown the heart.\n(to Vincente): If you surrender to existence you are victorious; immediately you are the crowned one --\nthat is the meaning of the word \"christ.\". But Christ was crucified. His crucifixion was really his crowing ceremony. For those who understand, for those who have eyes to see, his crucifixion is a crowing ceremony because at the last moment on the cross he surrendered totally. He said: \"Thy kingdom come, thy will be done.\" That was his last prayer. That is surrender.\nTo have one's own will is egoistic; to allow God's will to happen to you is surrender. To be with God and in God is to be victorious; there can be no other victory greater than his.\nA sannyasin has to live this paradox: the paradox of surrendering and realizing victory.\n(Veet Stanley: beyond the stony field)\nWe have all been stony fields, hence nothing has grown. We are all rocky inside\n-- so many blocks, so many stones and so many hindrances to growth. But we go on accumulating them, thinking them to be precious, thinking them to be diamonds. And they are not diamonds. They become more and more weighty on our soul; the heart is crushed underneath. But in the past all the societies all over the world have praised those qualities -- of being hard like a rock. They have been thought to be very manly. They have been praised, honored, because the society needed soldiers. It needed people to kill people and be killed by other people. It needed hard people living in the head and not in the heart. It needed people who couldn't feel, couldn't be sensitive. Only such people can be forced to be slaves because they will function like machines.\nEfficient they will be, but human they will not be.\nThe history of humanity up to now is not really a history of humanity. Humanity has yet to be born. Yes, once in a while there has been a human being but that is nothing much to brag about; if after thousands of years one Christ or one Buddha is born, that is nothing much. In fact each one should be a Buddha and a Christ. If once in a while a person is not, that can be forgiven, that can be allowed -- to err is human. But millions of people are just like rocks, robots: functioning from birth to death, but not knowing what life is, not really living, not enjoying, because to enjoy life you will need totally different qualities.\nYou will have to be more sensitive, you will have to be soft, you will have to be vulnerable. You will have to be more feminine, and you will have to come closer\nand closer to the heart. You will have to be less calculative, less logical. You will have to risk your head, only then can you attain to the heart. Hence I say: Enough is enough. Now go beyond it: become a fertile field. I want to grow roses in you!\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- (Prem Sangit)\nNo music is higher than love, no music is more musical than love. All music is a pale reflection of love, a very faraway, distant echo, because love simply means the art of playing on the veena of your heart. The heart is a musical instrument. It is a veena -- the most exquisite musical instrument, with immense potential: it can contain all the harmony of existence and it can express that harmony. But we never learn the art of love. We learn all other arts which are useful for life but we don't learn the art of love because love has no utility. It is like a rose flower -- what utility does it have? It is like a beautiful star: it is not a commodity; you cannot sell it, you cannot purchase it -- you cannot make money out of it. Hence nobody is interested in love; people are interested in money, and people are interested in things which will bring more and more money.\nLove may do just the opposite: rather than bringing anything to you it may take everything that you have. You may have to sacrifice your very life for it. It demands your totality. Hence very few courageous people ever move into the dimension of love. Everybody thinks that he loves but that is only thinking; otherwise the world would be a paradise -- if everybody was right. So many people, millions of people, loving each other: parents loving children, children loving parents, husbands loving wives, wives loving husbands, friends loving friends ... the whole world would be overflowing with love, flooded with love. But love seems to be nowhere at all, there is not even a trace. The world is absolutely love-less, a desert, with not even an oasis. So our love must be something pseudo.\nWe believe that we love and that belief helps us not to love, that belief helps us\nnever to learn the art of love. It is the subtlest art. I call religion nothing but an insight into the phenomenon of love. When you love a person you are becoming religious without your knowing it. When you start loving more people you are becoming more religious. Without your knowing it at all, God has already entered in you so silently that you have not even heard his footsteps.\nWhen you fall in love with a Master that is the most precious love possible on the earth. The God takes possession of you. Then he has really made a way into your heart. Not only on the periphery, he is no more scratching on the periphery: he has dug the well to the very core of your being. There is only one step more and love comes to its perfection.\nThe love between a Master and a disciple is just the last but one, and then you enter from the door of the Master into the divine. You disappear as you are; a totally new being is born. You will not be able to recognise the new being at all because it has nothing to do with the old, with the past. It is so totally new, it is discontinuous with the past. This is how one becomes a Buddha, how one becomes a Christ, a Krishna: dying to the old absolutely so that one can be born.\nSannyas has to be a death and a resurrection . Be ready to die! Resurrection follows automatically, of its own accord. All that is needed from your side is readiness to die. Die as an ego, die as a separate entity, and then the whole universe is yours with all its beauty and grandeur, with all its blessings and benediction.\nA sense of humour has never been thought to be religious. That has to be introduced into religion because without a sense of humour a man becomes dry, dull, desertlike. With a sense of humor so many flowers start blooming in you. The old spirituality was serious, the new spirituality has to be playful. The old spiritual person thought that he was doing something very great. My sannyasin has to be completely finished with that holier-than-thou attitude. We are not doing anything special. We have to transform the ordinary into the sacred -- that is the new spirituality, that is the new message of God.\nScriptures in Silence and Sermons in Stones Chapter #5\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2549","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/scriptures_in_silence_and_sermons_in_stone/part4/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/scriptures_in_silence_and_sermons_in_stone/>Scriptures In Silence And Sermons In Stone</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>12 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2549 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Scriptures_In_Silence_And_Sermons_In_Stone/part4.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part3>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

He must have been a man of tremendous silence. Just seeing the pale,
old, dead leaf falling from the tree he realized that all is momentary,
that life is going to end in death, that there is nothing to cling to,
nothing worth clinging to, that this life which ends in death is not the
true. The leaf became the message of God. In that very moment he became
a sannyasin. In that very moment the worthless was renounced. Not that
he made a deliberate decision to renounce; that is not needed</p><p>-- the very understanding that life is momentary, that life is
futile, that life is meaningless is enough; one starts searching for
another kind of life, on another plane. One has been moving outwards,
now one starts moving inwards. You have been searching for joy, bliss
and have been founding frustration, misery because that's what the
outside can give to you. The moment you turn in, the moment you start
exploring your interiority, great joy arises.</p><p>Meditation is the art of listening to existence with deep obedience,
with such totality that between you and the song of the bird there is no
barrier. Then the song of the bird becomes the message of the
Buddha.</p><p>Then in every silence there is a scripture; then every moment of life
is a contact with the divine. Then on every leaf is God's signature --
and in every stone a beautiful song is asleep, is hidden.</p><p>If you become silent the hidden starts becoming manifest. You start
hearing things which are not heard ordinarily and you start seeing thing
which are not seen ordinarily, as if new eyes were growing in you, new
ears were growing in you.</p><p>And the definition of meditation is also the definition of the
disciple: the art of listening to the master.</p><p>So really be a Simon!</p><p>Crucify the head, crown the heart.</p><p>(to Vincente): If you surrender to existence you are victorious;
immediately you are the crowned one --</p><p>that is the meaning of the word "christ.". But Christ was crucified.
His crucifixion was really his crowing ceremony. For those who
understand, for those who have eyes to see, his crucifixion is a crowing
ceremony because at the last moment on the cross he surrendered totally.
He said: "Thy kingdom come, thy will be done." That was his last prayer.
That is surrender.</p><p>To have one's own will is egoistic; to allow God's will to happen to
you is surrender. To be with God and in God is to be victorious; there
can be no other victory greater than his.</p><p>A sannyasin has to live this paradox: the paradox of surrendering and
realizing victory.</p><p>(Veet Stanley: beyond the stony field)</p><p>We have all been stony fields, hence nothing has grown. We are all
rocky inside</p><p>-- so many blocks, so many stones and so many hindrances to growth.
But we go on accumulating them, thinking them to be precious, thinking
them to be diamonds. And they are not diamonds. They become more and
more weighty on our soul; the heart is crushed underneath. But in the
past all the societies all over the world have praised those qualities
-- of being hard like a rock. They have been thought to be very manly.
They have been praised, honored, because the society needed soldiers. It
needed people to kill people and be killed by other people. It needed
hard people living in the head and not in the heart. It needed people
who couldn't feel, couldn't be sensitive. Only such people can be forced
to be slaves because they will function like machines.</p><p>Efficient they will be, but human they will not be.</p><p>The history of humanity up to now is not really a history of
humanity. Humanity has yet to be born. Yes, once in a while there has
been a human being but that is nothing much to brag about; if after
thousands of years one Christ or one Buddha is born, that is nothing
much. In fact each one should be a Buddha and a Christ. If once in a
while a person is not, that can be forgiven, that can be allowed -- to
err is human. But millions of people are just like rocks, robots:
functioning from birth to death, but not knowing what life is, not
really living, not enjoying, because to enjoy life you will need totally
different qualities.</p><p>You will have to be more sensitive, you will have to be soft, you
will have to be vulnerable. You will have to be more feminine, and you
will have to come closer</p><p>and closer to the heart. You will have to be less calculative, less
logical. You will have to risk your head, only then can you attain to
the heart. Hence I say: Enough is enough. Now go beyond it: become a
fertile field. I want to grow roses in you!</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:- (Prem Sangit)</p><p>No music is higher than love, no music is more musical than love. All
music is a pale reflection of love, a very faraway, distant echo,
because love simply means the art of playing on the veena of your heart.
The heart is a musical instrument. It is a veena -- the most exquisite
musical instrument, with immense potential: it can contain all the
harmony of existence and it can express that harmony. But we never learn
the art of love. We learn all other arts which are useful for life but
we don't learn the art of love because love has no utility. It is like a
rose flower -- what utility does it have? It is like a beautiful star:
it is not a commodity; you cannot sell it, you cannot purchase it -- you
cannot make money out of it. Hence nobody is interested in love; people
are interested in money, and people are interested in things which will
bring more and more money.</p><p>Love may do just the opposite: rather than bringing anything to you
it may take everything that you have. You may have to sacrifice your
very life for it. It demands your totality. Hence very few courageous
people ever move into the dimension of love. Everybody thinks that he
loves but that is only thinking; otherwise the world would be a paradise
-- if everybody was right. So many people, millions of people, loving
each other: parents loving children, children loving parents, husbands
loving wives, wives loving husbands, friends loving friends ... the
whole world would be overflowing with love, flooded with love. But love
seems to be nowhere at all, there is not even a trace. The world is
absolutely love-less, a desert, with not even an oasis. So our love must
be something pseudo.</p><p>We believe that we love and that belief helps us not to love, that
belief helps us</p><p>never to learn the art of love. It is the subtlest art. I call
religion nothing but an insight into the phenomenon of love. When you
love a person you are becoming religious without your knowing it. When
you start loving more people you are becoming more religious. Without
your knowing it at all, God has already entered in you so silently that
you have not even heard his footsteps.</p><p>When you fall in love with a Master that is the most precious love
possible on the earth. The God takes possession of you. Then he has
really made a way into your heart. Not only on the periphery, he is no
more scratching on the periphery: he has dug the well to the very core
of your being. There is only one step more and love comes to its
perfection.</p><p>The love between a Master and a disciple is just the last but one,
and then you enter from the door of the Master into the divine. You
disappear as you are; a totally new being is born. You will not be able
to recognise the new being at all because it has nothing to do with the
old, with the past. It is so totally new, it is discontinuous with the
past. This is how one becomes a Buddha, how one becomes a Christ, a
Krishna: dying to the old absolutely so that one can be born.</p><p>Sannyas has to be a death and a resurrection . Be ready to die!
Resurrection follows automatically, of its own accord. All that is
needed from your side is readiness to die. Die as an ego, die as a
separate entity, and then the whole universe is yours with all its
beauty and grandeur, with all its blessings and benediction.</p><p>A sense of humour has never been thought to be religious. That has to
be introduced into religion because without a sense of humour a man
becomes dry, dull, desertlike. With a sense of humor so many flowers
start blooming in you. The old spirituality was serious, the new
spirituality has to be playful. The old spiritual person thought that he
was doing something very great. My sannyasin has to be completely
finished with that holier-than-thou attitude. We are not doing anything
special. We have to transform the ordinary into the sacred -- that is
the new spirituality, that is the new message of God.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:justify id=scriptures-in-silence-and-sermons-in-stones>Scriptures in Silence

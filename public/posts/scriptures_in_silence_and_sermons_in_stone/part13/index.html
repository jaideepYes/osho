It is for reference purposes only.]\n(to Alan)\nSahajam means spontaneity -- and that's exactly the definition of sannyas. To be spontaneous is to be a sannyasin. To be spontaneous means to be responsible to the present.\nPeople are dominated by the past. Life goes on changing every moment and mind remains clinging to the past. There is a gap between the mind and life. Anything that comes out of the mind is never going to be a real response; it is only reaction. And it always falls short, it can't reach the target, it either goes above or goes below the past, which knows nothing of the present, or the arrow is directed by the future, which knows nothing of the present.\nTo be spontaneous means to live moment to moment, to respond to that which is, with no prejudice, with no mind, with no past, no future, with no time at all. Then suddenly there is a meeting a meeting between you and existence. That meeting is bliss, that meeting is God.\n(to Vincent)\nAnand means bliss -- not pleasure, not happiness, not even joy. Bliss is a totally different phenomenon.\nIt is not pleasure, because it has nothing to do with the body. It is not happiness; happiness is of the mind and very momentary. It is just comes and goes and keeps you in a turmoil. You can never be secure, you can never trust it; it is bound to betray you. That is its very nature.\nMind is in flux, and anything that happens through the mind is going to be a flux. It can't be eternal; it can only be momentary, within time. Hence every happiness brings unhappiness. It is like day and night, summer and winter. The wheel goes on moving: again the day comes and the night follows and the day comes and the night follows.\nBliss is not even joy, because joy is of the heart. Joy is far superior to pleasure, to happiness. It is far more delicate, more soft, more like flowerlike. If one has to choose between the three then one should choose joy. It is a subtle harmony. When your body, your mind and your heart are functioning together in deep accord, joy arises. In joy something is contributed by the body, something is contributed by the mind, but the major part is contributed by the heart. Joy contains something of pleasure, something if happiness and something more.\nBliss is beyond all three; it is of the spirit. To experience it one has to disidentify oneself from body, mind and heart. It is eternal. Once it comes it is forever. Then one can trust and relax and rest. It can't be stolen, it can't be taken away, it can't be burned. Even death is impotent as far as bliss is concerned. One who has known bliss has known something deathless.\nJoy dies very soon. It is like a roseflower, very delicate. It can be crushed very easily; anybody can pluck it. Just hit it with a stone and it is gone. To depend on joy is to live in a glasshouse; anybody can throw a stone and the whole house will collapse.\nThat's why you see women suffering so much. Men don't suffer so much because men depend on pleasure -- which is gross, bodily, tangible, can even be purchased in the marketplace Or at the most men depend on happiness, which\nis of the mind -- and still has a certain strengh, certain solidity. But the woman depends on joy; it is of the heart -- hence her joy can be crushed very easily: a single gesture, a single word, is enough.\nAnd because they depend on different dimensions communication is impossible. The man cannot understand. He has not done anything and the woman is crying and she is all in tears, and the man thinks \"Is she crazy or something? -- because I have not said anything, I have not done anything.\" He may have uttered just a wrong word, made a wrong gesture; he may not have even uttered a word, he may have just remained silent, but silent in a way that hurts the woman's heart.\nMen can understand body and mind very well. With the heart he moves into an alien territory. The 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nwoman understand the heart, hence she can become very joyful. But she goes in ups and downs: sometimes she is ecstatic, so joyful that you cannot believe she will ever weep and cry and scream -- and the next moment she is screaming and crying and throwing things. It seems impossible how she manages to move so quickly from one point to another.\nThe same is the case with small children: they also live in the heart, hence one moment they are angry, another moment they are so loving. One moment they are in rage; another moment they are hugging and kissing you and they're all love, all beautiful and sweet. But the heart has that problem: it is fragile.\nThe search is to find something which is eternal: that is bliss and the way is meditation. Meditation takes you beyond the body-mind-heart complex, because meditation is nothing but a disidentification from all that which you have become identified: I am not the body nor the mind nor the heart. When this understanding arises in you meditation has flowered. In that flowering is bliss.\n(to Pragitam)\nLife can be lived in tears -- many have chosen that way to live. Life can also be lived as laughter -- very few choose that. It is strange; one would have thought that many would choose life to be a song, not a sadness, a bliss, not a misery -- but that's not the case. In reality millions of people choose misery, tears, anxiety, anguish, as their lifestyle. They invest their whole energy in creating hell around themselves.\nFrom the outside it looks stupid, but there is a reason for it. The reason is that the more miserable you are, the more you are. The more miserable you are, the bigger your ego becomes. The ego feeds on misery, on negativity, on darkness -- that is its food and nourishment. If you choose to be blissful, if you choose to be a song, you will have to risk one thing, only one thing: the ego -- because that is the only discordant note in your being. You will have to drop the idea that \"I am.\" You will have to learn a totally different language\n-- that \"God is and I am not.\" I and God cannot exists together. That is an impossibility. Either I can exist or God.\nTo be a sannyasin means that now you are choosing God instead of I. This is a new way of life and a new vision. And great is the bliss of the person who can gather the courage of the ego because with that dropping all darkness disappears, with that dropping all is light, because your eyes become open. You attain to tremendous sensitivity, awareness. That is the moment when you hear the song, the divine song, the SONG OF SOLOMON.\nVery few people have understood the SONG OF SOLOMON. Jews and Christians both feel a little embarrassed whenever the question of Solomon's song arises. It looks as if it is something that should not be in the Bible. In fact it is the real Bible. Everything else can be dropped; just Solomon's song is enough. All else is secondary. But the problem with Christians and Jews is that Solomons song talks of love, passionate love, earthly love. It talks not in terms of the other world, but in terms of this world. He must have been a real Buddha -- not a pseudo, phony saint or mahatma.\nI have tremendous respect for Solomon and his song, because I want my sannyasins to live his song as their life -- a life of intense love, of passionate cheerfulness, of ecstasy; not a life of renunciation but a life of rejoicing.\n(to Sangitam)\nMusic is a simbol of harmony, accord. Man ordinarily lives a very unmusical life: a life of conflict, a life of discord. Man is not one but many. Man is a crowd and there is constant fight inside; day in, day out, the fight continues. One is fighting with oneself violently. It is very destructive, but that's how we are brought up to become soldiers, not sannyasins.\nA soldier has to live continuously is such a tension and anguish that he can sacrifice life any moment for any stupid excuse. In fact sacrifing life feels a great relief for the soldier.\nA sannyasin is a totally different world. He has to live life with such abandon, with such ecstasy, with such music, that each moment becomes a moment of paradise. Paradise is not there somewhere at the end of the journey, it is spread all over the way. You have to transform each moment of your life into paradise only then you can enter into the kingdom of God.\nIt is not possible to live your whole life in misery, then suddenly one day you knock on the doors of God\n.… Jesus says: Knock and the doors shall be opened .… True, but where will you find the doors? Unless you are tremendously blissful you will not find the doors. They are found only in great joy, they are found only 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nin ecstasy. When you are dancing to such intensity that the dancer has melted into it, when you are singing with such passion that the singer is no more there, only the song -- that is the moment when you find the door. Then certainly Jesus is right: Knock and the door shall be opened. In fact there is no need to knock, the doors are always open. God is always standing there waiting to welcome you home.\nScriptures in Silence and Sermons in Stones Chapter #14\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"1761","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/scriptures_in_silence_and_sermons_in_stone/part13/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/scriptures_in_silence_and_sermons_in_stone/>Scriptures In Silence And Sermons In Stone</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>9 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1761 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Scriptures_In_Silence_And_Sermons_In_Stone/part13.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part12>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

not find the doors. They are found only in great joy, they are found

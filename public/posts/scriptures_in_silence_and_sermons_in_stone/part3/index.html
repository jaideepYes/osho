It is for reference purposes only.]\n(Vega, fourteenth-month old, with his younger brother Rosario) (To their father): Now bring the new sannyasin here!\n(To Vega): You can come and be a witness ... come here!\nThis is his name, Swami Prem Tosho. Prem means love. Tosho means contentment. Just teach two things to him: love and contentment -- contentment in himself and love for others. In fact only somebody who is deeply contented can be loving. Out of contentment love starts flowing: love is a sharing of your contentment.\nLove is the only way to become a follower of Christ or of Buddha or of Lao Tzu\nor of any enlightned Master. They are all the same. Essentially their message is never different, it cannot be because the truth is one. Lies are many, thruth is one; hence religions must be based in some lies because there are so many religions. If truth is to be the foundation of anything then there can be only one thing. That's why there is only one science, because science is based in thruth, in objective truth. There is only one art because art is also based in subjectivity truth. But religions are many.\nMind has played a great trick on man. Priests have exploited humanity; they are the greatest enemies, the parasites. They have created so many religions to distract people; otherwise there is no need for Christians, Hindus, Mohammedans, Buddhists. Just a religious quality is enough, it need not have any adjective to it. The name of that quality is love.\nHome is the hereandnow.\nThe guest is always ready to come in but the host is missing. Either he is somewhere else dreaming, desiring He is never at home, never herenow -- he\nis either in the past or in the future.\nThere are only two ways to get astray: into that which is already past and into that which has not yet come. Past and future are the only two ways to escape from the present. And God knows only one time. He has no acquaintance with the past and the future; the present is the only time for him -- and we are never in the present. Hence the host goes on knocking and cannot find God because he knocks on the past, in the future. And God goes on knocking and cannot find the host because he knocks in the present and the host is never in the present.\nWe are very close to God but like parallel lines we go on, never meeting. Once we stop going into the past and the future the parallel lines start coming closer and closer together. One day suddenly there is only one line: two lines have disappeared. That is the moment of great joy, great benediction. That's what everyone is seeking, longing for. and because people go on missing it they are miserable.\nBe ready. And the only way to be ready is to live in the present, and you will become a home. That is the fulfillment of life.\n(To Gianpietro): This is your name .… You have a beautiful name so I am going to keep it exactly as it is. There is no meed to add anything to it, it is more than\nenough: Swami Giampietro. Giam means God's gracious gift; it comes from the Hebrew, John. And pietro comes from the Greek; it means strong in spirit, rocklike strenght. The strenght of the spirit is God's grace, God's gift.\nThe first thing to remember is that life has been given to us, it is not our achievment. In fact we don't know deserve it at all. It is a very strange law of existence that those who deserve it -- a Buddha, a Christ --\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\ndisappear from life, and those who don't deserve it go on getting life again and again. Once you deserve it you are ready to disappear into the ultimate. If you don't deserve it you will have to come back. Only those who fail, come back -- obviously. Those who fail have to come back to the same class, to the same school again. Those who pass move to higher planes of being, to higher schools which are not ordinarily visible.\nThis is the first thing to remember, that life is a gift. Don't waste it, use it. Use it in deserving it.\nAnd the second thing to remember: strenght of the spirit. It is not something that is yours either. It is God's constant flowing in you. You are breathing him every moment, unconsciously of course. The moment you become conscious you will be surprised: we eat God, we drink God, we breath God -- there is nothing else but God. He is our nourishment. He is our roots, he is our branches, the folliage, the flowers, the fruit.\nHe is all and we are nothing.\nThis is your name: Swami Anand Dharmen. Anand means bliss. Dharmen means in tune with the ultimate law, the dhamma. The universe is a great harmony -- everything fits with everything else. It is a tremendous miracle, so vast, immeasurable, infinite, yet everything fits with everything else absolutely.\nExcept for man. Man is the only black sheep in existence. And the reason why man does not fit is that man has been given a great gift: the gift of consciousness.\nEverything else has to fit. It is just natural to fit with the universe. Man has to decide whether to be in tune or not to be in tune. And man has his freedom of choice. It is a great gift but it can be misused, it is being misused by millions of people. They choose not to be in tune with existence. They choose conflict with existence, struggle with existence. Obviously they suffer for it, they have to suffer. You cannot fight the whole; the whole is to vast, too big. It is like a dewdrop fighting the ocean: it is just stupid , utter stupidity, but that's what many have decided to do. The ego is just a dewdrop fighting with God, trying to conquer the universe.\nDharmen means dropping the fight, dropping the struggle, surrendering, becoming part. Consciously choose to be part of the whole and great bliss arises out of it. To remain separate is misery; to become one is bliss.\nMan constantly remains in fight. There is a reason why it is so. Nobody likes fighting, still everybody goes on fighting. The reason is that the ego can exist only through fighting. The more you fight, the more you feel you are; the less you fight, the less you feel you are. If you stop fighting completely the ego disappears, evaporates.\nThat creates fear; it scares people not to be. And in reality that is our very nature: not to be. It is the ultimate paradox of being that being is revealed only when we have come to the point of non-being.\nShakespeare says: To be or not to be is the question. It is not the question ... because they are not alternatives. Not to be is the way to be. It is only through non-being that one arrives at being. It is by dissolving that you are, and you are for the first time. It is by disappearing that you appear. It is by dissolving that you are, and you are for the first time. It is by dying that you gain eternal life. That's the meaning of your name -- let it become your experience too.\nThe day you experience ego disappearing and still you are, with no sense of it, just a pure existence -- in that moment all boundaries are transcended, all miseries disappear. In that moment you can say \"I am and my father are one.\" In that moment you are God: Aham Brahamani. In that moment it can be said \"I am\nGod, because I am no more.\" God is possible only when you become absolutely absent, utterly empty; when there is nobody inside you suddenly God is found. That very nobodiness is another name for God.\nSo if you want to be, choose not to be. And that's the whole process of sannyas. It is the death because death is the door to the divine life. I teach the art of dying because there is no other way to teach you the art of living.\nHow long will you be here? (Samarpano): Ten days more.\nThat will be enough! Next time come for a longer period. It is very difficult to die in ten days (laughter) Next time come for a longer period ... and don't be afraid!\n(To Abraham): Abraham was chosen by god to be the father of a new spirituality, to become the source of a new spiritual dimension. He is one of the greatest mystics the world has ever known. He created one of 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nthe most precious secret schools of transformation.\nThis too is a mystery school and the beginning of a new spirituality. All the old spiritualities have become irrelevant. Man has progressed much, man has come of age; those spiritualities that were created by Abraham, by Krishna, by Lao Tzu, by Phytagoras, by Heraclitus, by Jesus have all become out-of-date.\nThey need a rebirth; they need to be given a new form, a new shape. They require a new language, a new expression. Too much dust has gathered down the centuries. It is natural, but that dust has to be removed.\nEach age needs a new kind of spirituality because each age is different from any other, hence messangers go on coming. A messanger is nothing but a man who translates the eternal truth for the contemporary man. Abraham is one of those\ngreat messangers of god. It is good to be associated with Abraham, but remember now that Abraham also needs a new birth. That's what sannyas is.\nBy passing through sannyas you will be coming a new man, you will be attaining new qualities, qualities which have never been thought to be religious. For example, love for life, a great affirmation of life has never been thought spiritual. On the contrary, all so-called spiritualities have, in some way or other, created the atmosphere of renounciation -- as if life has to be sanctioned, renounced, to attain god.\nThere is no need, at least there is no more any need of that kind of spirituality. Renounciation is dead.\nWe have to give sannyas a totally new vision, that of rejoicing. That is the meaning of anand: rejoice, be blissful.\nMy sannyasin has to be a dancing one. A sense of humor has never being thought to be religious. That has to be introduced into religion because without a sense of humor a man becomes dry, dull, desertlike.\nWith a sense of humor so many flowers start blooming in you. The old spirituality was serious, the new spirituality has to be playful. The old spiritual person thought that he was something very great. My sannyasin has to be completely finished with that holier-than-thou attitude. We are not doing anything special. We have to transform the ordinary into the sacred -- that is the new spirituality, that is the new message of god.\nMy function here is to be another Abraham.

sense of it, just a pure existence -- in that moment all boundaries are
transcended, all miseries disappear. In that moment you can say "I am
and my father are one." In that moment you are God: Aham Brahamani. In
that moment it can be said "I am</p><p>God, because I am no more." God is possible only when you become
absolutely absent, utterly empty; when there is nobody inside you
suddenly God is found. That very nobodiness is another name for God.</p><p>So if you want to be, choose not to be. And that's the whole process
of sannyas. It is the death because death is the door to the divine
life. I teach the art of dying because there is no other way to teach
you the art of living.</p><p>How long will you be here? (Samarpano): Ten days more.</p><p>That will be enough! Next time come for a longer period. It is very
difficult to die in ten days (laughter) Next time come for a longer
period ... and don't be afraid!</p><p>(To Abraham): Abraham was chosen by god to be the father of a new
spirituality, to become the source of a new spiritual dimension. He is
one of the greatest mystics the world has ever known. He created one of

All the old spiritualities have become irrelevant. Man has progressed
much, man has come of age; those spiritualities that were created by
Abraham, by Krishna, by Lao Tzu, by Phytagoras, by Heraclitus, by Jesus
have all become out-of-date.</p><p>They need a rebirth; they need to be given a new form, a new shape.
They require a new language, a new expression. Too much dust has
gathered down the centuries. It is natural, but that dust has to be
removed.</p><p>Each age needs a new kind of spirituality because each age is
different from any other, hence messangers go on coming. A messanger is
nothing but a man who translates the eternal truth for the contemporary
man. Abraham is one of those</p><p>great messangers of god. It is good to be associated with Abraham,
but remember now that Abraham also needs a new birth. That's what
sannyas is.</p><p>By passing through sannyas you will be coming a new man, you will be
attaining new qualities, qualities which have never been thought to be
religious. For example, love for life, a great affirmation of life has
never been thought spiritual. On the contrary, all so-called
spiritualities have, in some way or other, created the atmosphere of
renounciation -- as if life has to be sanctioned, renounced, to attain
god.</p><p>There is no need, at least there is no more any need of that kind of
spirituality. Renounciation is dead.</p><p>We have to give sannyas a totally new vision, that of rejoicing. That
is the meaning of anand: rejoice, be blissful.</p><p>My sannyasin has to be a dancing one. A sense of humor has never
being thought to be religious. That has to be introduced into religion
because without a sense of humor a man becomes dry, dull,
desertlike.</p><p>With a sense of humor so many flowers start blooming in you. The old
spirituality was serious, the new spirituality has to be playful. The
old spiritual person thought that he was something very great. My
sannyasin has to be completely finished with that holier-than-thou
attitude. We are not doing anything special. We have to transform the
ordinary into the sacred -- that is the new spirituality, that is the
new message of god.</p><p>My function here is to be another Abraham. <strong>Scriptures in

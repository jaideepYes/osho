It is not something that has grown in you but that has been implanted by others: the society, the church, the state. They have their own interest in creating belief in people: believers are obedient, believers are not rebellious, believers remain stupid; they never grow in intelligence. And the society does not want people to be intelligent.\nIt can tolerate the intellectuals but not the really intelligent. It can tolerate the professors, the scholars, the educated people, the knowledgeable people. They are intellectuals, not wise, not intelligent, because if they were intelligent they could not co-operate with all the kinds of stupidities that go on in the name of tradition, culture, civilisation, religion. They would not be able to co-operate\nwith all this nonsense, they would be bound to rebel.\nHence society has a vested interest in belief: Create belief. It is a poisonous phenomenon. It destroys intelligence; it destroys independence, it destroys rebelliousness; it creates yea-sayers. And the yes of a man who cannot say no is always impotent. First a man has to learn to say no, then only is his yes of any meaning.\nFaith is a totally different phenomenon. It is not social, it is individual. It is not given by others. It is out of your own search that slowly slowly it grows in you, that you start trusting existence -- not out of fear, but out of experience, out of love, out of joy. And then faith is freedom, tremendous freedom, and infinite ecstasy.\nThere is no god, but there is godliness. God means a person; godliness means a quality. Because for thousands of years we have conceived of god as a person, we have created unnecessary trouble for ourselves. In the first place, our idea of god never fits with reality -- because there is no person. Existence is not a person, it is energy, unbounded, infinite, beginningless, endless; it has no form, no shape. It is not a person, so you cannot pray to it.\nBecause of the idea of god as a person, prayer became very important. The moment you drop the idea of a person, prayer disappears; instead meditation becomes significant. That's why in the West meditation never became the central core of religion. It was Buddha, Mahavira, Patanjali -- these three persons in the East, in India; and Lao Tzu, Chuang Tzu and Lieh Tzu -- three persons in China. These six persons arc the most important people because they changed the whole shape of religion from the very foundation. Instead of prayer, meditation became important.\nIf god is a person you can pray with folded hands. You can ask and demand and you can bribe, you can praise and you can do all kinds of foolish things. If there is no person then you cannot address anybody.\nThen you have to go within, there is nobody without. Then you have to dive deeper into your own being. It is at the Very core of your own existence that you become aware of a quality that permeates the whole: that quality is godliness.\nThe world is full of godliness but there is no god. Because of the idea of a person Friedrich Nietzsche could say that god is dead. And a hundred years have passed\nand nobody has been able to refute him --\nbecause there was no god in the first place. If I meet Friedrich Nietzsche I will say \"What nonsense arc you talking about? How can somebody die if he has never been there in the first place?\" But he shocked the whole Western consciousness. Nobody has been able to answer him because in fact he declared a truth: god as a person has collapsed. Man has become a little more mature and the whole idea of god as a person is 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nchildish, immature.\nMy effort here is to give you a glimpse of godliness, not of god; to create a bridge between you and godliness, not god. And godliness is everywhere. We are overflooded with it: it is in the flowers, in the trees, in the rocks, in people, in you. Wherever you look it is there. But the first experience has to happen within; then you will start seeing it without too.\nGod, or godliness is our strength: they both mean the same to me.\nMan alone is absolutely powerless. The moment man becomes part of god, he becomes powerful. With god is our victory, without there is only failure and nothing else.\nThis is the first lesson of sannyas. From now onwards remember as much as possible that you have to be in tune with the whole. And to be in tune with the whole one has to surrender. One cannot go on believing in one's ego; the ego has to be dropped. The ego is impotent. And once you drop the ego you are omnipotent. Then the whole energy of god starts flowing through you. Ego blocks the energy; egolessness becomes a medium.\nLove is the ruler of all.\nI teach only two things, meditation and love. For you the emphasis is going to be on love; meditation will be a support. For a few others meditation is going to be\nthe main key; then love becomes the support.\nBoth are needed, the question is just of emphasis. For you the emphasis is going to be on love: be loving to the whole, let love be your religion.\nLove is the most shining star. No star in the whole sky is comparable to it. It is more shining than the sun, it is more shining than the many great suns that surround our earth, that are spread to infinity.\nLove is the most luminous phenomenon but one needs totally different eyes to know it, to see it, to feel it. The ordinary eyes cannot look into it. They are meant to look only into matter; they are capable of seeing the peripheral, the superficial, they have no capacity for depth. And love is something which belongs to your ultimate depth. The more inwards you go, the more loving you become. In fact that is the only criterion of whether a person is going inwards or not. If he is becoming more and more loving to others, towards himself too, if his life is becoming a compassion then certainly he is going deeper, he is coming closer to truth, he is becoming suffused with the divine energy of existence.\nAnd at the ultimate peak or at the ultimate depth -- which are the same -- when love explodes, it is like atomic explosion: one becomes pure light, just light from one end to the other end. That's why this ultimate moment is known as enlightenment. It is a transmutation, transfiguration. A totally new being is born which does not belong to time, which belongs to eternity. The mind is part of time, the heart is not part of time.\nAnd the heart is the centre of love.\nSeek the heart, go deeper into it, risk everything for it because nothing is more precious than that. Even if life is lost but you have attained a single moment of glorious love, life has been a fulfillment; you didn't live in vain, you lived, you really lived meaningfully. A single moment of love is more valuable than thousands of lives which are loveless.\nTo be a servant of love is really to be a master of love. One begins as a servant but one ends as a master.\nIn the world you begin as a master and you end up as a servant. That is the law of the outside. In the inner world there is a totally different law: you begin as a servant, then you can end up as a master.\nBuddha has said: In the outer world everything is sweet in the beginning and bitter in the end, and in the inside everything is bitter in the beginning and sweet in the end. And remember, only the end is true; the beginning can be deceptive.\nKeep alert about it: always remember the ultimate outcome. Otherwise one can go on swallowing sugar-coated poison -- that's what goes on happening.\nSo it is difficult to surrender the ego, to be just a servant, to be a slave of god, of love, of existence; it is hard to swallow it, but once you have understood the inner law it is possible to do it and to do it joyfully.\nMan ordinarily always remains in struggle, always fighting with something or other. And deep down every fight is a fight against god, because only god exists and nobody else.\nOnce this is understood, that only god exists, then one can drop all fighting; there is no point in struggling. In fact one starts praying to be defeated by god. To be defeated by god is the greatest victory in 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nlife, to be overcome by him is the most precious moment.\nThat's what sannyas is all about: it is asking for your own defeat. Let me repeat: sannyas is a defeat, a defeat of the ego. And the moment the ego is there no more, god is realised.\nSannyas is the search for the divine principle. Call it god, truth, freedom, nirvana -- it comes to the same thing. The search is for something which is missing in life. We are alive but unaware of what life is all about. We are, but are completely oblivious of the fact of who we are. Existence is there but awareness is not there -- and unless existence becomes aware of itself life goes on remaining empty, unfulfilled.\nThe search is for awareness. Awareness is the divine principle, the principle that can transform you from a mechanical existence into a conscious ecstasy and the\nsearch is not outer at all, it is inner. The principle has to be found with closed eyes within oneself. It is already there; we have to dive into ourselves.\nMeditation is the art of diving, into oneself. Sannyas is the courage to take the plunge. One is going into the unfathomable; and in the beginning it is frightening, but only in the beginning. As you become more and more skillful at diving deeper and deeper, life becomes an adventure of tremendous beauty and benediction.\nScriptures in Silence and Sermons in Stones Chapter #40\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"1848","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/scriptures_in_silence_and_sermons_in_stone/part39/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/scriptures_in_silence_and_sermons_in_stone/>Scriptures In Silence And Sermons In Stone</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>9 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1848 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Scriptures_In_Silence_And_Sermons_In_Stone/part39.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part38>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

Let me repeat: sannyas is a defeat, a defeat of the ego. And the moment
the ego is there no more, god is realised.</p><p>Sannyas is the search for the divine principle. Call it god, truth,
freedom, <em>nirvana</em> -- it comes to the same thing. The search is
for something which is missing in life. We are alive but unaware of what
life is all about. We are, but are completely oblivious of the fact of
who we are. Existence is there but awareness is not there -- and unless
existence becomes aware of itself life goes on remaining empty,
unfulfilled.</p><p>The search is for awareness. Awareness is the divine principle, the
principle that can transform you from a mechanical existence into a
conscious ecstasy and the</p><p>search is not outer at all, it is inner. The principle has to be
found with closed eyes within oneself. It is already there; we have to
dive into ourselves.</p><p>Meditation is the art of diving, into oneself. Sannyas is the courage
to take the plunge. One is going into the unfathomable; and in the
beginning it is frightening, but only in the beginning. As you become
more and more skillful at diving deeper and deeper, life becomes an
adventure of tremendous beauty and benediction.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:justify id=scriptures-in-silence-and-sermons-in-stones>Scriptures in Silence

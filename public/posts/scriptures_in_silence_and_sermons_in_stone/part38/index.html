From the outside everything will be the same but from the inside nothing will be the same. Up to now life has been an unconscious affair, now it has to be conscious. Awareness has to be added to your being. That is rebirth, and that is being born into 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- god.\nCatherine means pure, clean, innocent. Purity has nothing to do with morality, it has something to do with innocence. Morality is a calculated step. One tries to be good so that one can be virtuous. And why does one want to be virtuous? -- to\ngain something in the other world. It is all arithmetic, it is not innocence.\nMorality is very clever, cunning. Real purity knows nothing of moral and immoral, it is a transcendence, a transcendence of all dualities: good and bad, even god and devil. The child is not concerned with anything. The child simply lives spontaneously, moment to moment...\nSannyas needs tremendous courage because it is an effort to live your life according to your light -- not according to the convention, not according to the priest and the politicians, not according to the past tradition, the church, but according to your own light. It is a tremendous assertion of one's freedom. It needs courage, and not ordinary courage. It really needs the utmost in courage, fearlessness, because all those powers that you will be rebelling against would like to crush you. One has to be very intelligent not to be crushed by them and yet never to compromise.\nAnd sannyas is also the beginning of a kingly life. Ordinarily it has been taught in the past that the sannyasin is a beggar. My sannyasin is not a beggar. Even if he has nothing he has to live like a king. To live like a king does not require many possessions; it requires integrity, it requires individuality, it requires intelligence, it requires a centred, rooted being. It has nothing to do with possessions, kingdoms. A Buddha becomes a bigger king when he renounces his kingdom. Jesus never had a kingdom, but who can compete with him in his kingliness. Even on the cross he is a king: he dies with such grace, such beauty, such prayer.\nOnly a king can afford that -- He does not die a dog's death.\nGeorge Gurdjieff used to say to people, \"Beware, otherwise you will die a dog's death... because out of millions of people it is only once in a while that a man dies, not like a dog, but like a king. Not even Alexander dies like a king; only a Buddha can, only a Jesus can die like a king.\nSome inner kingdom is needed, some inner luminosity is needed. Those who are courageous, they can attain it.\nTilo: one who trust in justice.\nPeople are so selfish that they cannot be just. They only think of themselves, they never think of others.\nTheir whole interest is in how to use others, how to manipulate others, how to dominate others. They cannot be just. Their interest is in possessing people. A just person cannot possess anybody, not even the wife, the husband, the child. We cannot possess, because to possess is unjust; it destroys the other's individuality, the other's freedom. And that is the most unjust act in the world: to reduce the other to a thing. To possess him means to reduce him to a thing.\nJustice is possible only when you start feeling that you and others are not separate. That happens only through deep meditation -- the realisation that \"I am one with the whole,\" that \"If I am unjust to anybody, I am unjust to myself. If I harm anybody I am harming myself and nobody else, sooner or later it is going to rebound on me.\" This is the whole philosophy of karma: whatsoever you do to others will be done to you.\nJesus is right when he says: Do unto others what you would like to be done to you. That should be the foundation of all justice. But that is possible only through meditation; not by believing in Jesus but by coming to know this reality, we are not separate beings, we are only separate on the surface. The deeper we go, less and less is the separation. At the very centre your being, the whole universe converges. And to feel it once is enough; you will never be the same again. Then your life is that of justice, of love, of compassion.\nMan tries to live as a separate will, separate from the whole. That's how he creates aLl kinds of miseries for himself: he is trying to do the impossible. It is like a wave in the ocean trying to live according to its will, not according to the whole ocean: the wave is bound to go crazy. That's what has happened to humanity at large: humanity has gone mad for the simple reason that everybody is trying to live as if the separation from existence is a truth. It is a lie. He are one with the whole. God's will is our will.\nTo understand this brings a tremendous relaxation.' Then one is at peace with existence, in harmony; then there is no problem, no conflict. Then whatsoever is the will of god is good, because god cannot will evil. God is good, the whole is good, and whatsoever is going to happen is going to be good. One can relax, one need not be anxious, anxiety-ridden; one need no worry about what is going to happen.\nThe moment this is understood -- that god's will is working through the whole -- one can forget all 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nworries. That's how a sannyasin lives: knowing that god cares, knowing that god loves, knowing that whatsoever happens is good; it can't be otherwise!\nGod is not to be realised, not to be achieved, but only remembered, recognised, declared. You are already that. The Upanishads say TAT TVAM ASI Thou art that. Not that you have to become that, there is no question of becoming: god is your being. You may know it, you may not know it; it makes no difference: you are godly.\nMeditation does not bring you closer to god, it does not make you a god, it simply helps you to discover who you are. It simply removes a few curtains, it simply removes a few layers behind which your reality is hidden. It is a discovery, not an achievement. And the moment you discover it, it is nothing special, because it is not only that you are godly, everybody is. It is the most ordinary phenomenon.\nTo be divine is natural: trees are divine and rocks are divine and man is divine. But the moment you know who you are you become a Buddha, you become a Christ, you become a Krishna. That becoming is not really a becoming but just a recognition of a long-forgotten truth, a remembrance of a language forgotten.\nWe are all manifestations of god. The forms are different, but the spirit is the same. There are many things which are different; they are all accidental. But the essential is not different. The incidental is different but the intrinsic is the same. This has to be remembered again and again so that it becomes a natural undercurrent of your consciousness. As it deepens in your heart you start manifesting something which you have never known before: god starts radiating through your being.\nHe is waiting deep inside you like a seed. Remembrance becomes the soil. If you go on remembering it the seed starts growing, and soon there is great foliage and flowers and fruits. Life then knows what beauty is, what meaning is, what glory is. To die without knowing it is to have lived fruitlessly.\nSannyas is a vow, a commitment, a total involvement: \"I am not going to die without knowing the truth of my being.\"\nWe are not what we appear to be. Our reality is unmanifest, it is hidden. It has to be searched for. It is not far away, it is deep within you; you cannot find it anywhere else, you need not go anywhere else. But one has to pull oneself in from many many desires and dreams. One has to pull oneself inwards.\nWhen you are centred, at your centre totally he revelation, you are not the body, you are not the mind, you are the stuff called god. The whole existence is made of the same stuff. To have felt it once is enough; then your past disappears as if it has never existed, just as in the morning when you wake up there are no more dreams. You know that they have not been there at all, you have only been imagining them. We have imagined so many lives and so many worlds, but it is all dreaming.\nBecoming a sanyasin means making an effort to wake up.\nThis moment you are becoming new. Forget the past. Simply disconnect yourself from your memories; don't look backwards any more.\nThe moment we stop looking backwards, we also stop looking forwards. It is the past that creates the future, it is the memory that creates imagination. When neither is there, there is great silence. That silence is meditation, and in that silence you are in tune with existence. And that moment of attunement with existence is bliss.\nScriptures in Silence and Sermons in Stones Chapter #39\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"1701","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/scriptures_in_silence_and_sermons_in_stone/part38/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/scriptures_in_silence_and_sermons_in_stone/>Scriptures In Silence And Sermons In Stone</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>8 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1701 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Scriptures_In_Silence_And_Sermons_In_Stone/part38.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part37>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

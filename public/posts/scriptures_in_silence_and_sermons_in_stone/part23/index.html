It is a blessing.\nJacob was also one of the twelve disciples of Jesus, and that has far more significant a meaning. To be a disciple is one of the greatest experiences of life, because it is an experience of trust, love, surrender. And all that is beautiful comes to those who trust, who love, who surrender.\nTo be a disciple is an absolutely necessary step; it can't be avoided. If one really wants to know the truth, to know God, to know what it is all about, then to be a disciple is a bridge. It needs courage - love needs courage. And it is the ultimate in love because it has no instinctive part to it.\nSex is closer to animals - so is greed. But no animal has been said to be a disciple. That is an absolutely human phenomenon, something non-instinctive, something that does not belong to the physiology and the chemistry of your body. It does not even belong to your psychology; it belongs to your spirit, to your being, to your real core.\nBe blessed because this rare moment of becoming a disciple has arisen in your life. And if you take this jump, God certainly will protect you.\nPritam.\nLove existence and you will become a beloved of existence, because existence only echoes and re-echoes, it reflects and rebounds. Whatsoever we do to it, it goes on doing to us a thousandfold.\n\"Hate life\" -- that's what has been said by the pseudo religious. Then you will be hated by life. Love and you will be loved. and when the whole existence showers on you as love -- a rain of love, flowers of love raining on you -- then life is true life, because then it is ecstasy. Then only do you know the significance, the meaning, the purpose, of why you are, of why this existence is.\nNobody else can answer the why, but when love showers on you from the sky and from the stars and from the trees, you know it; in your very heart of hearts you feel it. And that's exactly the deepest desire of your very being: to be beloved of the whole. But it has to be earned, and the way to earn it is to be a great lover. Then you will be loved.\nBut we go on doing just stupid things. We want to be loved but we don't love. We want to see a beautiful face in the mirror but we don't make a beautiful face; we go on making an ugly face and then we are angry at the mirror. The mirror simply reflects. So does existence -- it is just a mirror.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Helmut.\nBliss is possible only if you are a daredevil. Less than that won't do. Misery is cheap, any coward can afford it; hence you will find all cowards miserable. All the miserable people are cowards. Nothing is keeping them imprisoned in misery except their cowardliness -- because they can't go beyond the limits drawn by the\nsociety, the state, the church.\nAnd bliss is not something that can be experienced within such limitations. It needs entry into the unlimited, into the unknown, into the uncharted. Courage is a must; only courageous people become blissful. And whenever there is a blissful person and a courageous person, fame follows like a shadow. Bliss and courage shine forth. That's why centuries have passed but we cannot forget a Jesus, we cannot forgive him because he showed us that we are cowards, and we cannot forget him because he showed us our possibility -- that we also can become blissful.\nSandhano means enquiry, quest, adventure.\nMan is born as a quest. Man is not born as a complete being. A dog is born complete. A tree, a rock --\nthe whole of existence, except for man -- have one similar thing about them: they are all complete. Only man is incomplete; hence man has an opening. Everything else is closed. A rose is a rose is a rose, but man may be a thousand and one things. A man can be a Judas, a man can be a Jesus. All possibilities are open, all alternatives, available.\nSo those who take their life for granted miss the whole point. Life is a quest, it is an enquiry, an enquiry into how to be total, how to be whole. This is the dignity of man, this is his uniqueness: because is not complete he can grow; because he is not yet entire he can blossom, he can learn, he can become. Only man evolves.\nI don't agree with Charles Darwin. He says that man has evolved out of monkeys, but what have the other monkeys been doing? Why don't they evolve into human beings? It has been a long time but they simply go on being monkeys! There seems to indication at all. At least they should start learning their ABC\nbut they have not even started that!\nHence I say that Charles Darwin is utterly wrong. Man has not evolved out of monkeys, man is a totally different kind of being. Only man knows how to evolve. No monkey knows, no ape knows. They simply remain the same; they go on reproducing themselves. For millions of years they have been doing it. No single monkey has risen higher than normal monkeyhood, a But man grows,\nevolves. Man is a quest. Man is not a being but a becoming, an enquiry. That's his beauty, his glory -- a gift from god.\nPrem Roelof\nFame is poisoned if it comes without love. Fame is nectar if it comes out of love. One can be famous like a Genghis Khan, a Tamerlane, like Joseph Stalin or Adolf Hitler, that fame is ugly. It would have been far better if Adolf Hitler had died absolutely unknown, anonymous. It would have been a great blessing to the world. Their fame is full of blood, murder, butchery. We don't need such famous people anymore.\nBut a Buddha also becomes famous, a Jesus, a Zarathustra. Their fame comes from a totally different quality of being. Their love makes them famous, their fragrance is such that they share their joy totally.\nAdolf Hitler stinks; hence he becomes famous. Buddha has a perfume; hence he becomes famous.\nBe loving, be love, and then fame or no fame, it doesn't matter. But it comes, it comes inevitably. One becomes a star in the dark night of existence. One cannot hide it; it shines forth. From thousands of light years away, still you will see it. This is the case with the man of love. Love is the most luminous experience of life. Let that be your prayer and your religion.\nJoseph.\nBliss is an increasing faithfulness, in trust Misery is in doubt. There more you\ndoubt, the more your life becomes surrounded by darkness. the more you doubt, the more your being becomes negative -- and to be negative is to be incapable of receiving god. To be negative is to be rejecting, to be negative is to be closed, to be negative is to be resistant.\nFaith means being open, available, receptive like a womb; then only is bliss possible. when you are open to the wind and the rain and to the sun of existence, when there is no resistance at all, when you are in a state of let-go -- that is trust, the state of let-go. When you are moving with existence, just floating with the river towards the ocean with no idea of your own about where you would like to go, with no idea that you 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nare, so utterly relaxed with the river of life that you are no more separate, just a ripple in the river, a wave --\nthat is faith.\nJoseph is the name of Jesus' father. It is very symbolic: only trust can give birth to Christ, only trust can become the right space for Christ-consciousness.\nPaul has two meanings: one comes from Latin -- it means small; the other comes from Greek -- then it means rest, relaxation. Both meanings are significant, significant for the seeker of truth, significant for those who really want to grow. One has to be both. One has to be so small, as if one were not, one has to be a nobody. If you really want to be somebody you will have to fulfill the condition of being a nobody. And only if you are a nobody can you relax. The ego is always tense and keeps you tense; when there is no ego there is rest.\nAnd in rest is all, because when you are totally restful God is available to you. You enter into the kingdom of God only when you are totally relaxed -- no tension, no desire, no mind -- just like a small child, a nobody, and totally relaxed. Let that be your work on yourself.\nArihant means one who has killed the real enemy.\nSelf-ignorance is the real enemy, unconsciousness is the real enemy. To live like a somnambulist is to be one's own enemy. The enemy is not outside you, it is hidden in your own mind. It is your mind -- and one has to go beyond it.\nThe only way to go beyond the enemy, to kill the enemy, is to be more and more alert, more and more conscious of your thoughts, of your acts, of your desires, of your feelings. Even walking, walk consciously, even eating, eat consciously. These acts can be done without any consciousness, we can do them mechanically. De-automatize your acts, bring consciousness to each act; then you can bring consciousness to each thought, because action is gross, thought is subtle. And when you have become conscious of your thoughts you can bring\nconsciousness to your feelings -- they are the subtlest. These are the three layers of our bondage. These three constitute the enemy. If you can become conscious of all these three you have become a conqueror.\nThat's the whole purpose of sannyas: to make you a conqueror, to make you victorious.\nGyanam means wisdom... not the so-called knowledge, but knowing; not knowledge but knowing.\nKnowledge is available from the outside. Knowing needs an inner purification. Knowledge is information, knowing is your capacity to see, to understand. Knowledge never transforms anybody. It can make you a great scholar, but to be a scholar is to be nothing but a parrot. The scholar simply repeats: he is a gramophone record, neither more nor less. But a knower knows, knows on his own authority. He does not believe, he sees. He is not a Christian, he is a Christ; he is not a Buddhist, he is a Buddha.\nRemember it, it needs a radical change in your consciousness, a totally new kind of consciousness: alert, aware, meditative, loving. These are the foundations which will make you able to see. You will not become more informed but you will become totally transformed.\nMy work is not to inform you but to transform you. And that's what sannyas is all about.\nPragito means a song.\nIn the past religions have been destroying the beauty of life, they have been anti- life. They have taught people how to be sad; all their practices are to make people serious and sad. This has been a pathological history, and because of this, millions of people turned away from religion. It was natural. The intelligent people became anti-religious because they could not see the point of being anti- life. Only mediocre and stupid people became anti-life; hence religion has remained in the domain of fools.\nMy effort is to transform the very quality of religion, to make it a song, a celebration, a multi-dimensional celebration of life, and existence, of love, of beauty, of poetry, of painting, of dance, of all that is beautiful, of all that enhances creativity.\nMy sannyasins have to become creators of beauty, singers, mad singers, ecstatic dancers. Only then is religion true and the approach towards God valid; otherwise our approach towards God is pathological. It is not healthy, it is not whole, it is not wholesome.\nNirup.\nGod is formless and so are you, and so is everybody! The form is an illusion; it is imposed by our 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nlimited senses. It is as if you look out of a window and the frame of the window gives a frame to the sky.\nThe sky has no frame, it is unlimited, but because you are standing behind a window, your window-frame becomes a frame for the sky, at least for the sky that you see.\nIf you think that the frame of the window is the frame of the sky you are living in an illusion. Our eyes are windows, so are our senses: they give forms to things.\nIn fact everything is formless, and to understand the formless is to understand God. God is nothing but another name for this formlessness.\nScriptures in Silence and Sermons in Stones Chapter #24\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2292","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/scriptures_in_silence_and_sermons_in_stone/part23/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/scriptures_in_silence_and_sermons_in_stone/>Scriptures In Silence And Sermons In Stone</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>11 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2292 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Scriptures_In_Silence_And_Sermons_In_Stone/part23.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part22>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

years away, still you will see it. This is the case with the man of
love. Love is the most luminous experience of life. Let that be your
prayer and your religion.</p><p>Joseph.</p><p>Bliss is an increasing faithfulness, in trust Misery is in doubt.
There more you</p><p>doubt, the more your life becomes surrounded by darkness. the more
you doubt, the more your being becomes negative -- and to be negative is
to be incapable of receiving god. To be negative is to be rejecting, to
be negative is to be closed, to be negative is to be resistant.</p><p>Faith means being open, available, receptive like a womb; then only
is bliss possible. when you are open to the wind and the rain and to the
sun of existence, when there is no resistance at all, when you are in a
state of let-go -- that is trust, the state of let-go. When you are
moving with existence, just floating with the river towards the ocean
with no idea of your own about where you would like to go, with no idea
that you 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on

separate, just a ripple in the river, a wave --</p><p>that is faith.</p><p>Joseph is the name of Jesus' father. It is very symbolic: only trust
can give birth to Christ, only trust can become the right space for
Christ-consciousness.</p><p>Paul has two meanings: one comes from Latin -- it means small; the
other comes from Greek -- then it means rest, relaxation. Both meanings
are significant, significant for the seeker of truth, significant for
those who really want to grow. One has to be both. One has to be so
small, as if one were not, one has to be a nobody. If you really want to
be somebody you will have to fulfill the condition of being a nobody.
And only if you are a nobody can you relax. The ego is always tense and
keeps you tense; when there is no ego there is rest.</p><p>And in rest is all, because when you are totally restful God is
available to you. You enter into the kingdom of God only when you are
totally relaxed -- no tension, no desire, no mind -- just like a small
child, a nobody, and totally relaxed. Let that be your work on
yourself.</p><p>Arihant means one who has killed the real enemy.</p><p>Self-ignorance is the real enemy, unconsciousness is the real enemy.
To live like a somnambulist is to be one's own enemy. The enemy is not
outside you, it is hidden in your own mind. It is your mind -- and one
has to go beyond it.</p><p>The only way to go beyond the enemy, to kill the enemy, is to be more
and more alert, more and more conscious of your thoughts, of your acts,
of your desires, of your feelings. Even walking, walk consciously, even
eating, eat consciously. These acts can be done without any
consciousness, we can do them mechanically. De-automatize your acts,
bring consciousness to each act; then you can bring consciousness to
each thought, because action is gross, thought is subtle. And when you
have become conscious of your thoughts you can bring</p><p>consciousness to your feelings -- they are the subtlest. These are
the three layers of our bondage. These three constitute the enemy. If
you can become conscious of all these three you have become a
conqueror.</p><p>That's the whole purpose of sannyas: to make you a conqueror, to make
you victorious.</p><p>Gyanam means wisdom... not the so-called knowledge, but knowing; not
knowledge but knowing.</p><p>Knowledge is available from the outside. Knowing needs an inner
purification. Knowledge is information, knowing is your capacity to see,
to understand. Knowledge never transforms anybody. It can make you a
great scholar, but to be a scholar is to be nothing but a parrot. The
scholar simply repeats: he is a gramophone record, neither more nor
less. But a knower knows, knows on his own authority. He does not
believe, he sees. He is not a Christian, he is a Christ; he is not a
Buddhist, he is a Buddha.</p><p>Remember it, it needs a radical change in your consciousness, a
totally new kind of consciousness: alert, aware, meditative, loving.
These are the foundations which will make you able to see. You will not
become more informed but you will become totally transformed.</p><p>My work is not to inform you but to transform you. And that's what
sannyas is all about.</p><p>Pragito means a song.</p><p>In the past religions have been destroying the beauty of life, they
have been anti- life. They have taught people how to be sad; all their
practices are to make people serious and sad. This has been a
pathological history, and because of this, millions of people turned
away from religion. It was natural. The intelligent people became
anti-religious because they could not see the point of being anti- life.
Only mediocre and stupid people became anti-life; hence religion has
remained in the domain of fools.</p><p>My effort is to transform the very quality of religion, to make it a
song, a celebration, a multi-dimensional celebration of life, and
existence, of love, of beauty, of poetry, of painting, of dance, of all
that is beautiful, of all that enhances creativity.</p><p>My sannyasins have to become creators of beauty, singers, mad
singers, ecstatic dancers. Only then is religion true and the approach
towards God valid; otherwise our approach towards God is pathological.
It is not healthy, it is not whole, it is not wholesome.</p><p>Nirup.</p><p>God is formless and so are you, and so is everybody! The form is an

the window gives a frame to the sky.</p><p>The sky has no frame, it is unlimited, but because you are standing
behind a window, your window-frame becomes a frame for the sky, at least
for the sky that you see.</p><p>If you think that the frame of the window is the frame of the sky you
are living in an illusion. Our eyes are windows, so are our senses: they
give forms to things.</p><p>In fact everything is formless, and to understand the formless is to

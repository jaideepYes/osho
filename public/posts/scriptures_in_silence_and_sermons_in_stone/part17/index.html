Science makes it prose, religion transforms it into poetry. To live life as prose is to live in a mundane way, and to live life as poetry is to live in a sacred way. One need not be a Christian or a Mohammedan or a Hindu or a Jew to be religious, but once certainly has to learn the way of poetry. If one wants to be religious one has to know how to be poetic\n-- that cannot be avoided.\nAll these religions are different ways of becoming poetic, of approaching life not through logic, but through love, of looking at existence not with fear, but with wonder. And it is only eyes which are full of wonder and awe that are capable of knowing the truth.\nThe scientist only knows the fact, but never the truth. The fact is useful but not liberating; the fact is needed but it does not give life significance. It is a\nnecessity, but one cannot live for it and one cannot die for it. and unless you have something to live for and to die for you have nothing.\nIn giving you sannyas I am giving you something to live for and to die for, something so valuable that one can risk all for it. And in that very risking one is born, born anew. For the first time one really becomes a self, one becomes integrated. Otherwise people are living just wishy-washy lives, hodgepodge lives. They are living a king of mess, a confusion, a madness -- utterly futile.\nMy first and last lesson to my sannyasins is to be poetic: to sing, to dance, to celebrate, to love, because these are the ways one comes closer and closer to god and one day becomes one with god, merges into his ocean. We are dewdrops, dropping into the ocean. Fear arises; one hesitates because one can see that one is going to disappear -- that it is going to be death. But what is death on one side is life, eternal life, on another. The dewdrop disappears as a dewdrop but appears as the ocean itself. It is worth it.\nPrem means love. Chequesh means eagle.\nLove is a flight from the known to the unknown, hence the fear. It is because of this fear that millions of people decide not to love at all. Life seems to be safer, more secure, manageable, controlled, without love.\nYou seem to be able to possess life. The moment love enters, you disappear. Then you are no more the controller, then there is no controller at all. Then it is a beautiful chaos. It has its own order but it knows no outer order. It has its own discipline but that is intrinsic, it is not imposed from outside. And because it is a constant movement from the known to the unknown, unless one is courageous, so courageous that one is 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nready to risk life for it, one cannot really love. To love is the greatest courage in life. Yes, one becomes an eagle and starts soaring higher and higher into the realms of the unknown. How long will you be staying?\n-- Another week after your birthday. I have to go back to my American Indian people and tell them about you.\n-- Tell them about me. They will understand me more than anybody else.\n-- I was afraid at first, but I'm not any more.\n-- Good, good!\nBliss is the noblest quality. Misery the ugliest. To remain miserable means that one is clinging to ugliness. And to remain miserable you will have to remain confined in the dark cells of the unconscious, you will have to remain in bondage, in chains. It is your decision, because that bondage is self-imposed, those chains are self-created. You are the prisoner and you are the jailer too; hence it is only a question of self-determination to come out of the misery. It can be dropped in a single instant of understanding. In fact it is never dropped gradually: it is sudden enlightenment. The moment you see that you are creating it, that you are the creator of it, the very seeing is the dropping, and immediately there is a rebirth.\nAll ugliness disappears, all darkness disappears, and your life starts opening like a rose flower. Then you have all the beauty of the world and all the nobility of the world and all the godliness of the world.\nBe blissful and god is yours. In the old times it was said that if you attain to god you will be blissful. I say just the opposite: be blissful and you will attain to god. There is no other way to god. Bliss is the way to god. One can forget all about god if one can only remember to be blissful. Then god is bound to happen, is inevitable.\nPrem Niraj: love cloud.\nLove has many qualities which are similar to the qualities of a cloud.\nThe first and the most important is freedom. A cloud is not confined to anything, not tethered. So is the case with love; it is free to move in all directions. It is so free that it has no destination. Destination means slavery. Destination means that you are predetermined. Love has no destination. It is sheer play. It is not work, it is not duty. It is never a means to anything else; it is the very end itself.\nThe cloud has no fixed form. It constantly changes, it is never the same for two consecutive moments. so is the case with love. And we will try to give it a certain form and shape. We are trying to do the impossible; then we fail, then frustration is the result. Love never frustrates anybody. It is our expectations, impossible expectations of love, which creates frustration.\nNever try to give a form and a shape to your love. Allow it to remain shapeless, formless, because it is not a thing, it is an experience. It cannot be defined, and it is not gross; it is very subtle, the subtlest experience of life.\nThe cloud is always in a state of let-go. If the wind says to it \"Come along, I am going to the north,\" it has no resistance, it doesn't know no. It is always yea- saying. It simply goes to the north. It does not ask why, it does not insist on knowing the reason. It does not say, \"I have other plans. I want to go to the south, not to the north.\" The cloud has no plans, no purposes for the future. It is available to the winds. It is so totally available that in the very total availability it knows the ultimate taste of liberation.\nSo is the case with love: it is a state of let-go. It allows the whole existence to do whatsoever it wants to do, to take one wherever it wants to. It has no idea of how things should be. It moves moment to moment, with no idea, no prejudice, it moves without any concepts.\nThe English word \"concept\" comes from the same root as the word \"conceit.\" Love knows no concepts or conceits. It is simply free from all these burdens, hence it can float like a cloud in an infinite sky. The whole sky belongs to it because it claims nothing. It possesses the whole sky because it tries to possess nothing.\n(Hank becomes Deva Sahaj.)\nThe door to the divine is spontaneity. To be spontaneous is to be in god. Mind is never spontaneous. It is either in the past or in the future, either in that which is no more or in that which is not yet. Between these two it goes on missing that which is, and that is the door. The present moment is not part of time, hence the present moment is not available to mind either. Mind and time are synonymous. You can say that mind is time inside your being, and time is mind outside you, but they are one phenomenon.\nThe present moment is neither part of time nor part of mind. When you are in the\npresent moment you 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nare in god. What is the true meaning of meditation, the true meaning of prayer, the true meaning of love.\nAnd when one acts out of the present moment, that action is never binding because it is not your action, it is god acting through you, it is god flowing through you.\nTo be spontaneous is to be a sannyasin. That's my definition of a sannyasin, so one has to remember it constantly.\nWhen P. D. Ouspensky. one of the chief disciples of George Gurdjieff, was dying, his disciples and friends were very puzzled because he was doing such stupid things. They could not believe it, because he was a very logical man. He was one of the greatest mathematicians of his time, absolutely rational. The doctors told him not to leave America because it was dangerous, his body was not in a state to travel. But he left America. There was no reason to go but he insisted irrationally. And when he went to England he started travelling all around the country in his car. His friends said, \"Are you trying to commit suicide or what? -- because doctors say 'Don't move at all.'\" But he wouldn't listen.\nEven then they would stay for one or two days in a hotel somewhere, in a guest house, in a rest house, he would not sit, he would continuously walk. Even in his room he would walk till he almost fell dead on the bed.\nThen finally they asked, \"We don't understand -- have you gone mad or what?\"\nHe said, \"If you have understood my teaching and the teaching of George Gurdjieff... I am trying to do it, I am trying to remember that I am dying. I want to die remembering. I have died many times before not remembering. This time I want to die remembering, and the only way to remember is to do something that keeps me awake, otherwise I am bound to fall asleep.\"\nAnd he died almost walking. He fell, but there was a smile on his face, he died remembering, he died in the present moment knowing what was happening.\nAnd to die in the present moment means there is going to be only one more birth, that's all. This is just the last but one. The next birth will be in awareness, and the whole of the next life will be of awareness. If one can live alert, moment to moment, one can also die in alertness, awareness. To live and to die and to be born -- these three are the most important moments. If one can manage all three in awareness then one never comes back to the wheel of life and death. One becomes free of it, one becomes a Buddha.\nIt is very symbolic that the story of Buddha says that he was born on the full- moon night, he became enlightened on the same full-moon night, he died on the same full-moon night. It may not have happened so but it is very symbolic. It may have happened -- it is possible. But even if it did not happen historically, it is symbolic. It is simply saying that he died in the same moment as he was born and he became enlightened in the same moment. That same moment is the present moment. That is the full-moon night, because in the present moment you are full of light.\nSo that is going to be your works be more and more alert. Act not out of memory, not out of imagination, but out of the actual present. You may be able to experience some very extraordinary experiences which are available to only very few people. If you work hard, this life can be just the last but one.\n(Swarga means paradise.)\nParadise is not somewhere else. Paradise is not geographical. It is not above the clouds in the heavens it is within you. And it is not in some other time, after death. It is in you right now, you are made of it, so there is no need to seek and search anywhere else. All that is needed is to relax and to be in one's self, to dive into one's own being deeply, so deeply that the whole world disappears as if it did not exist for the moment, so that your consciousness is all that exists. All existence becomes non-existential, just your life is all... and the purity of it, because it is uncontaminated by anything. Nothing is reflected in your mirror. Your consciousness is simply pure, without any ripple, without any waves. In that moment one comes to know what paradise is.\nWe have not lost it somewhere else, we have not been driven out of paradise. It\nalready exists inside us, it has always existed inside us, but we never look within ourselves.\nWe go on looking outwards, hence we go on missing our own treasures, our own kingdom of god.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nScriptures in Silence and Sermons in Stones Chapter #18\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2356","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/scriptures_in_silence_and_sermons_in_stone/part17/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/scriptures_in_silence_and_sermons_in_stone/>Scriptures In Silence And Sermons In Stone</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>12 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2356 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Scriptures_In_Silence_And_Sermons_In_Stone/part17.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part16>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

love, which creates frustration.</p><p>Never try to give a form and a shape to your love. Allow it to remain
shapeless, formless, because it is not a thing, it is an experience. It
cannot be defined, and it is not gross; it is very subtle, the subtlest
experience of life.</p><p>The cloud is always in a state of let-go. If the wind says to it
"Come along, I am going to the north," it has no resistance, it doesn't
know no. It is always yea- saying. It simply goes to the north. It does
not ask why, it does not insist on knowing the reason. It does not say,
"I have other plans. I want to go to the south, not to the north." The
cloud has no plans, no purposes for the future. It is available to the
winds. It is so totally available that in the very total availability it
knows the ultimate taste of liberation.</p><p>So is the case with love: it is a state of let-go. It allows the
whole existence to do whatsoever it wants to do, to take one wherever it
wants to. It has no idea of how things should be. It moves moment to
moment, with no idea, no prejudice, it moves without any concepts.</p><p>The English word "concept" comes from the same root as the word
"conceit." Love knows no concepts or conceits. It is simply free from
all these burdens, hence it can float like a cloud in an infinite sky.
The whole sky belongs to it because it claims nothing. It possesses the
whole sky because it tries to possess nothing.</p><p>(Hank becomes Deva Sahaj.)</p><p>The door to the divine is spontaneity. To be spontaneous is to be in
god. Mind is never spontaneous. It is either in the past or in the
future, either in that which is no more or in that which is not yet.
Between these two it goes on missing that which is, and that is the
door. The present moment is not part of time, hence the present moment
is not available to mind either. Mind and time are synonymous. You can
say that mind is time inside your being, and time is mind outside you,
but they are one phenomenon.</p><p>The present moment is neither part of time nor part of mind. When you

of prayer, the true meaning of love.</p><p>And when one acts out of the present moment, that action is never
binding because it is not your action, it is god acting through you, it
is god flowing through you.</p><p>To be spontaneous is to be a sannyasin. That's my definition of a
sannyasin, so one has to remember it constantly.</p><p>When P. D. Ouspensky. one of the chief disciples of George Gurdjieff,
was dying, his disciples and friends were very puzzled because he was
doing such stupid things. They could not believe it, because he was a
very logical man. He was one of the greatest mathematicians of his time,
absolutely rational. The doctors told him not to leave America because
it was dangerous, his body was not in a state to travel. But he left
America. There was no reason to go but he insisted irrationally. And
when he went to England he started travelling all around the country in
his car. His friends said, "Are you trying to commit suicide or what? --
because doctors say 'Don't move at all.'" But he wouldn't listen.</p><p>Even then they would stay for one or two days in a hotel somewhere,
in a guest house, in a rest house, he would not sit, he would
continuously walk. Even in his room he would walk till he almost fell
dead on the bed.</p><p>Then finally they asked, "We don't understand -- have you gone mad or
what?"</p><p>He said, "If you have understood my teaching and the teaching of
George Gurdjieff... I am trying to do it, I am trying to remember that I
am dying. I want to die remembering. I have died many times before
<em>not</em> remembering. This time I want to die remembering, and the
only way to remember is to do something that keeps me awake, otherwise I
am bound to fall asleep."</p><p>And he died almost walking. He fell, but there was a smile on his
face, he died remembering, he died in the present moment knowing what
was happening.</p><p>And to die in the present moment means there is going to be only one
more birth, that's all. This is just the last but one. The next birth
will be in awareness, and the whole of the next life will be of
awareness. If one can live alert, moment to moment, one can also die in
alertness, awareness. To live and to die and to be born -- these three
are the most important moments. If one can manage all three in awareness
then one never comes back to the wheel of life and death. One becomes
free of it, one becomes a Buddha.</p><p>It is very symbolic that the story of Buddha says that he was born on
the full- moon night, he became enlightened on the same full-moon night,
he died on the same full-moon night. It may not have happened so but it
is very symbolic. It may have happened -- it is possible. But even if it
did not happen historically, it is symbolic. It is simply saying that he
died in the same moment as he was born and he became enlightened in the
same moment. <em>That</em> same moment is the present moment. That is
the full-moon night, because in the present moment you are full of
light.</p><p>So that is going to be your works be more and more alert. Act not out
of memory, not out of imagination, but out of the actual present. You
may be able to experience some very extraordinary experiences which are
available to only very few people. If you work hard, this life can be
just the last but one.</p><p>(Swarga means paradise.)</p><p>Paradise is not somewhere else. Paradise is not geographical. It is
not above the clouds in the heavens it is within you. And it is not in
some other time, after death. It is in you right now, you are made of
it, so there is no need to seek and search anywhere else. All that is
needed is to relax and to be in one's self, to dive into one's own being
deeply, so deeply that the whole world disappears as if it did not exist
for the moment, so that your consciousness is all that exists. All
existence becomes non-existential, just your life is all... and the
purity of it, because it is uncontaminated by anything. Nothing is
reflected in your mirror. Your consciousness is simply pure, without any
ripple, without any waves. In that moment one comes to know what
paradise is.</p><p>We have not lost it somewhere else, we have not been driven out of
paradise. It</p><p>already exists inside us, it has always existed inside us, but we
never look within ourselves.</p><p>We go on looking outwards, hence we go on missing our own treasures,
our own kingdom of god.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on

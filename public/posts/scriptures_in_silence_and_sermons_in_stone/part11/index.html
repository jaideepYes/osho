Lies are very very alluring but ultimately they are going to ditch you into failure, frustration. They can't lead to victory. How can the false ever be victorious? -- it is impossible. Only the true can be. And without victory life is meaningless.\nVictory brings many flowers; it is victory that becomes a spring to the soul. But always remember that untruth may win small battles -- for the moment it may seem that you are winning with untruth -- but it never wins the war. The ultimate victory is always of truth.\nIn India they have an ancient saying, satyameva jaivate: Truth is always victorious. This is the trust of a sannyasin, that truth is always victorious. Be true of yourself and to the world. Don't be phony, don't be pseudo, don't pretend. Let things be as they are. Don't hide -- be authentic.\n(To Rosie)\nAnand means bliss, Rosie means two things. The first meaning is rose; the\nsecond meaning is a giver of love, and both menaings are beautiful. But neither of them is possible without bliss as your foundation. It is out of bliss that roses, roses of the heart, grow. And it is out of roses that the fragrace of love is released.\nYou can't give that which you don't have. If the inner rose has not yet opened all your love is nothing but words. If the inner rose has opened there is no need to say anything, no words are needed. Wherever you are, with whomsoever you are, love goes on radiating, goes on pulsating. It becomes a constant dance of energy around you -- and it can open only if you provide the basic needs; that is blissfulness.\nPeople love out of despair. That is the most impossible thing. It can't happen in the very nature of existence, it is not possible. People love because they are sad. They seek the other because they are lonely, and love is possible only when you are blissful. Love is possible only when you are not lonely, but alone; not bored with yourself, but enchanted, ecstatic, with yourself.\nMeditation helps you to be blissful; bliss helps the rose of the heart to open; and then love comes of its own accord, just as the fragrance comes to the rose.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nIn the right hands even a rock becomes a rose; in the wrong hands even a rose becomes a rock -- it all depends on you. To show and to emphasize this fact, in Zen monasteries they make rock gardens. Now before Zen tried that, nobody had ever thought that there could be something like a rock garden. A garden needs trees, needs flowers, needs lawns! But Zen people have done something tremendously beautiful. They make rock gardens; no tree, no plant -- just sand and rock. But they arrange the sand and rock in such beautiful patterns that the sand becomes as beautiful as any lawn can ever be. And the rocks become so tremendously graceful that even trees may feel jealous.\nIn Zen rock gardens moss grows on ancient rocks like flowers; and the sand is so\nsilent -- naturally, there is nothing to make any sound. It is so innocent and so cool. When you sit in a rock garden slowly slowly you become part of it: sitting silently, doing nothing you also become a rock. You start feeling a deep affinity with the rocks, with the sand.\nMany mystics have moved to the desert. The desert has been like a magnet; for a few people it has always been calling. The infinity of the desert, the unchangingness, the eternity of the desert and the beauty of the night in a desert is something incomparable, because the air is so clean, unpolluted -- and the stars look so close that if you try just a little you can touch them. The stars don't look very close by, as if some distance is bridged. The other world, the other shore, is not far away: it is visible.\nSo remember it: in the right hands, with the right approach, the desert also has a beauty of its own. In the wrong hands even the rose bushes are nothing. Unless you have the aesthetic sensibility the flowers can't do anything. and one has to keep it as a goal: the day a rock in your hand turn into a rose ... the texture of it, the coolness of it, the feel of it and you are enchanted, you fall in love with the rock .… That day is of great significance. From that day onwards there will be nothing ugly for you, nothing hard for you, because your heart is soft now. Even in a rock it can find a sermon; even in a rock it can find a song; even in a rock it can find some hidden beauty.\n(adding Anand to her old name)\nShedma means a field, a vineyard, but is used poetically as a symbol for the mother earth. So your name will mean blissful mother earth.\nAnd it is very significant, because my sannyas is not other-wordly; it is very earthly. It is down to earth.\nI am in tremendous love with the earth. I am not against this world. I don't teach any renunciation; I teach rejoicing, I teach celebration. Celebrate the earth because this earth is part of God: to condemn it is to condemn God himself. And most of the religions of the world have condemned the earth. They knew only one way to praise the other world, and that was first to condemn this earth -- then in contrast you can praise the other world. That is a very stupid attitude.\nIn my vision you can praise the other world only if you praise this world, because this world is a steppingstone to the other. If this shore of the river is\ncondemned, the other is condemned too, because they both belong to the same river. Love this shore so that you can love the other too.\nThe earth is a symbol of tremendous significance. It is the symbol of the material, the solid, the existential, the manifest. It is the symbol of creation. And the earth has evolved highest in consciousness.\nWe are fortunate that we are part of this earth. Other stars, however they look, are dead. In fact up to now there has been no certainty that life exists anywhere else; there are only assumptions. Assumptions are there, guesswork is there, great guesswork -- even scientists are getting involved in that guessing and they say that there are at least fifty thousand planets in the whole universe where life has happened. But it is all sheer guesswork. It is out of mathematics that they come to these conclusions; otherwise there is no solid ground for them.\nExcept for this earth the whole universe is, in a way, dead: the moon is dead, the sun is dead, the stars are dead. God must be closer to this earth than to anything else. And it is not only that life has happened, Moses, Abraham, Jesus, buddha, Krishna -- people who have reached the ultimate peak, who are godly, as godly as one can be. This earth has produced such beautiful flowers.\nBuddha has said: this very earth, the lotus paradise, and this very body, the Buddha. The earth represents the body.\nLove the earth, love the body. And remember: this very earth, the lotus paradise\n.… If we can learn how to live on this earth beautifully, lovingly, blissfully, then there is no need to be worried about the after-life; it will take care of itself because it is going to be a continuity of this life. Nothing ever really dies.\nEverything continues in new forms, on new planes. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\n(Anand Vajay: blissful victory)\nThe only thing worth being [victorionized] is bliss. Everything else is just a toy: you can play with it for the moment but not for long. Soon you will be fed up with it, bored. Soon you will throw it into the corner of the room and you will start searching for a new toy. That's how ordinary humanity lives: moving from one toy to another in the hope that these gadgets are going to give us bliss. They cannot.\nBliss has nothing to do with your outer achievements. It is a journey inwards. The farther you are from yourself, the more miserable you are. The closer you come to your center of being, the more blissful you become. When you are absolutely centered in yourself tremendous bliss wells up. That is the victory, true victory: not the victory of the Alexanders, but the victory of the Buddhas. And that's the whole purpose of being a sannyasin.\n(Sabine becomes Anand Sugandha)\nBliss is a fragrance, it is a perfume. When you are at home, at ease, it arises; whenever you are relaxed, in rest, it arises. The only requirement for bliss is to be at rest, to be at home, to be totally relaxed.\nPeople are in misery because they go on doing just the opposite; they are never at home, they are always somewhere else. Home is in the present but they are either in the past or in the future; they are never at home. Their house is empty; it goes on gathering dust. It is almost a ruin because there is nobody to take care of it. And people are miserable because they are always tense, always in a hurry to reach somewhere --\nand there is nowhere to reach, nowhere to go. The world is not going anywhere. It is not a journey in fact, but a dance. It has no destination as such; otherwise once the destination was achieved the world would die, then there would be nothing to do. It is a playfulness; there is no destination.\nPeople live with an idea that they have to achieve this, to achieve that, to be this, to be that. That keeps them tense and that very tension is the cause of misery. And because they are so tense they cannot relax, they cannot rest; they toss and turn even in their sleep. Even on their holidays they become occupied with some nonsense or other.\nPshychologists are very concerned about the coming century because as technology is taking over man's work the greatest problem tha psychologists are\ngoing to encounter is: what is man going to do without occupation? He will create nuisance. He may turn destructive, murderous, suicidal. He may start doing things he has never done, he may become absolutely perverted because being restful is the only thing he is almost incapable of.\nThere is a possibility in the future century -- in just twenty years' time, many of us will be there to see it\n-- that the people who are ready not to ask for any employment will be paid more that the people who ask for employment, because you can't have both employment and pay. You have to choose.\nThis is a strange world ... where people talk about being restful but whatsoever they do for the whole of their lives makes them more and more restless. They hope that one day they will retire and then everything will be put right, but by the time they retire they have accumulated such habits of restlessness that they are at a complete loss: what to do with their retirement?\nDoctors say that retired people die ten years earlier than they would have died if they had remained occupied. Not knowing anything else they start slipping into death.\nMeditation is going to become more and more important in the future. It has never been so important in the past as it's going to be in the future. Sannyas is going to be the only way for the future humanity because it will teach you how to be playful, how to be restful, how to be without any goals and yet happy.\nSo that is your work: drop all tensions, drop all hurring; drop all goals and destinations. Drop the achieving mind and start enjoying the moment. Whatsoever you are doing in the moment or not doing --\nstart enjoying it so that you can slowly come back to the right place where really belong, so that you can become more centered. And out of that centering a perfume arises. That perfume is bliss!\n(to Judith)\nPramila means the loving one -- and that is the work for you. Become more and more loving. Love for love's sake. Love unconditionally, with no expectations, with no hopes -- not even unconscious ones -- that it will be responded to,\nreturned. Love unaddressedly. Love the whole existence. It is one reality: the trees 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nand the mountains and the people are not really different. We all partecipate together, we exist in a deep harmony. We go on breathing in oxigen and breathing out carbon dioxide; trees go on breathing in carbon-dioxide and breathing out oxygen. Now without trees we will not be able to exist and without us trees will not be able to exist. We are joined together, we interpenetrate. And that's how the whole existence is interlinked.\nSo love unaddressedly, the trees, the stars, the mountains, the people, the animals. The point is not to whom you are loving, the point is that you are loving. That is the meaning of your name: just a loving one.\nThat is your meditation, and that will be the key for you to open the doors. It can unlock the very mistery of life and existence.\n(Hansraj, the raya swan)\nThe East has tremendous respect for the swan. It has become a symbol for certain spiritual qualities. The most important quality for a spiritual person is to constantly remember that god is our home. The remembrance has to become so deep, has to go to such depths that you need not remember it deliberately; it goes on resounding in you.\nThe myth is that the swan always remembers its home. In India the home of the wwans is deep in the Himalayas. Only when it is too cold and the swan cannot survive there does it come to the plains for a few months. But it never forgets its home; it never becomes entangled here. It will live on the lakes and the ponds and the rivers for those three or four months when there is too much snow and life is impossible and the lake from where the swans come is frozen. But after three or four months, suddenly one day they start moving back to the Himalayas, as if a deep remembrance goes on through them, like an undercurrent. Not only do they remember the place, they remember the exact date when they have to go\nback. Suddenly, all over India, swans will start moving towards the Himalayas. The swans are back exactly in time for the lake to be melting again and things are getting warmer.\nBecause of this quality the swan has become symbolic of the religious man. He has to remember that we are visitors here, guests at the most. We come from a totally different world and we should not forget about it.\nLive in the world byt go on remembering god -- that's your work. Live life in its totality but still never forget for a single moment that god is our home, that we have to go one day, and that the day is not far off.\nAnd when the day comes don't cling. When death comes don't cling to the world. Go joyously, dancingly, because death in nothing but a calling of god. You have been called home. It is your invitation, it is not an enemy.\nDeath is a friend -- as much a friend as life is, because both are given to us from the same source. God gives us life and god gives us death.\n(to Dick)\nDevasharan means at the feet of God. That's what sannyas is all about: a surrender, a deep, total surrender, to the feet of God.\nThose feet are not visible. You cannot find them, you cannot touch them, but you can still surrender to them. The more you surrender, the more you become aware that they are everywhere. When the surrender is really total you will find that the whole existence is nothing but the feet of God. And in that surrender is joy, in that let-go is beauty. All fight disappears, and with all fight disappearing the ego dies.\nThe ego can exist only if you fight. Surrender is poison to the ego; hence the emphasis on surrender.\nFight is food; surrender is poison. And the ego has to die, only then can you be born. In one sheath there can't be two swords. Either you can live inside yourself or the ego does. If the ego lives you have to go underground lives, and the egos are sitting on the throne. In surrender the ego disappears and your underground self starts surfacing back to its natural status, its natural state.\nDevasharan means that now you are not more important, only God is important; that now your life is only to be an instrument of God, a bamboo flute on his lips. You just have to be hollow and let him sing the song if he wants. Or if he does not want, then silence is as beautiful as the song.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nScriptures in Silence and Sermons in Stones Chapter #12\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"3058","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/scriptures_in_silence_and_sermons_in_stone/part11/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/scriptures_in_silence_and_sermons_in_stone/>Scriptures In Silence And Sermons In Stone</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>15 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;3058 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Scriptures_In_Silence_And_Sermons_In_Stone/part11.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part10>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

before Zen tried that, nobody had ever thought that there could be
something like a rock garden. A garden needs trees, needs flowers, needs
lawns! But Zen people have done something tremendously beautiful. They
make rock gardens; no tree, no plant -- just sand and rock. But they
arrange the sand and rock in such beautiful patterns that the sand
becomes as beautiful as any lawn can ever be. And the rocks become so
tremendously graceful that even trees may feel jealous.</p><p>In Zen rock gardens moss grows on ancient rocks like flowers; and the
sand is so</p><p>silent -- naturally, there is nothing to make any sound. It is so
innocent and so cool. When you sit in a rock garden slowly slowly you
become part of it: sitting silently, doing nothing you <em>also</em>
become a rock. You start feeling a deep affinity with the rocks, with
the sand.</p><p>Many mystics have moved to the desert. The desert has been like a
magnet; for a few people it has always been calling. The infinity of the
desert, the unchangingness, the eternity of the desert and the beauty of
the night in a desert is something incomparable, because the air is so
clean, unpolluted -- and the stars look so close that if you try just a
little you can touch them. The stars don't look <em>very</em> close by,
as if some distance is bridged. The other world, the other shore, is not
far away: it is visible.</p><p>So remember it: in the right hands, with the right approach, the
desert also has a beauty of its own. In the wrong hands even the rose
bushes are nothing. Unless you have the aesthetic sensibility the
flowers can't do anything. and one has to keep it as a goal: the day a
rock in your hand turn into a rose ... the texture of it, the coolness
of it, the feel of it and you are enchanted, you fall in love with the
rock .… That day is of great significance. From that day onwards there
will be nothing ugly for you, nothing hard for you, because your heart
is soft now. Even in a rock it can find a sermon; even in a rock it can
find a song; even in a rock it can find some hidden beauty.</p><p>(adding Anand to her old name)</p><p>Shedma means a field, a vineyard, but is used poetically as a symbol
for the mother earth. So your name will mean blissful mother earth.</p><p>And it is very significant, because my sannyas is not other-wordly;
it is very earthly. It is down to earth.</p><p>I am in tremendous love with the earth. I am not against this world.
I don't teach any renunciation; I teach rejoicing, I teach celebration.
Celebrate the earth because this earth is part of God: to condemn it is
to condemn God himself. And most of the religions of the world have
condemned the earth. They knew only one way to praise the other world,
and that was first to condemn this earth -- then in contrast you can
praise the other world. That is a very stupid attitude.</p><p>In my vision you can praise the other world only if you praise
<em>this</em> world, because this world is a steppingstone to the other.
If this shore of the river is</p><p>condemned, the other is condemned too, because they both belong to
the same river. Love this shore so that you can love the other too.</p><p>The earth is a symbol of tremendous significance. It is the symbol of
the material, the solid, the existential, the manifest. It is the symbol
of creation. And the earth has evolved highest in consciousness.</p><p>We are fortunate that we are part of this earth. Other stars, however
they look, are dead. In fact up to now there has been no certainty that
life exists anywhere else; there are only assumptions. Assumptions are
there, guesswork is there, great guesswork -- even scientists are
getting involved in that guessing and they say that there are at least
fifty thousand planets in the whole universe where life has happened.
But it is all sheer guesswork. It is out of mathematics that they come
to these conclusions; otherwise there is no solid ground for them.</p><p>Except for this earth the whole universe is, in a way, dead: the moon
is dead, the sun is dead, the stars are dead. God must be closer to this
earth than to anything else. And it is not only that life has happened,
Moses, Abraham, Jesus, buddha, Krishna -- people who have reached the
ultimate peak, who are godly, as godly as one can be. This earth has
produced such beautiful flowers.</p><p>Buddha has said: <em>this</em> very earth, the lotus paradise, and
this very body, the Buddha. The earth represents the body.</p><p>Love the earth, love the body. And remember: this very earth, the
lotus paradise</p><p>.… If we can learn how to live on this earth beautifully, lovingly,
blissfully, then there is no need to be worried about the after-life; it
will take care of itself because it is going to be a continuity of
<em>this</em> life. Nothing ever really dies.</p><p>Everything continues in new forms, on new planes. 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:justify id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>(Anand Vajay: blissful victory)</p><p>The only thing worth being [victorionized] is bliss. Everything else
is just a toy: you can play with it for the moment but not for long.
Soon you will be fed up with it, bored. Soon you will throw it into the
corner of the room and you will start searching for a new toy. That's
how ordinary humanity lives: moving from one toy to another in the hope
that these gadgets are going to give us bliss. They cannot.</p><p>Bliss has nothing to do with your outer achievements. It is a journey
inwards. The farther you are from yourself, the more miserable you are.
The closer you come to your center of being, the more blissful you
become. When you are absolutely centered in yourself tremendous bliss
wells up. That is the victory, true victory: not the victory of the
Alexanders, but the victory of the Buddhas. And that's the whole purpose
of being a sannyasin.</p><p>(Sabine becomes Anand Sugandha)</p><p>Bliss is a fragrance, it is a perfume. When you are at home, at ease,
it arises; whenever you are relaxed, in rest, it arises. The only
requirement for bliss is to be at rest, to be at home, to be totally
relaxed.</p><p>People are in misery because they go on doing just the opposite; they
are <em>never</em> at home, they are always somewhere else. Home is in
the present but they are either in the past or in the future; they are
never at home. Their house is empty; it goes on gathering dust. It is
almost a ruin because there is nobody to take care of it. And people are
miserable because they are always tense, always in a hurry to reach
somewhere --</p><p>and there is nowhere to reach, nowhere to go. The world is not going
anywhere. It is not a journey in fact, but a dance. It has no
destination as such; otherwise once the destination was achieved the
world would die, then there would be nothing to do. It is a playfulness;
there is no destination.</p><p>People live with an idea that they have to achieve this, to achieve
that, to be this, to be that. That keeps them tense and that very
tension is the cause of misery. And because they are so tense they
cannot relax, they cannot rest; they toss and turn even in their sleep.
Even on their holidays they become occupied with some nonsense or
other.</p><p>Pshychologists are very concerned about the coming century because as
technology is taking over man's work the greatest problem tha
psychologists are</p><p>going to encounter is: what is man going to do without occupation? He
will create nuisance. He may turn destructive, murderous, suicidal. He
may start doing things he has never done, he may become absolutely
perverted because being restful is the only thing he is almost incapable
of.</p><p>There <em>is</em> a possibility in the future century -- in just
twenty years' time, many of us will be there to see it</p><p>-- that the people who are ready not to ask for any employment will
be paid more that the people who ask for employment, because you can't
have both employment and pay. You have to choose.</p><p>This is a strange world ... where people talk about being restful but
whatsoever they do for the whole of their lives makes them more and more
restless. They hope that one day they will retire and then everything
will be put right, but by the time they retire they have accumulated
such habits of restlessness that they are at a complete loss: what to do
with their retirement?</p><p>Doctors say that retired people die ten years earlier than they would
have died if they had remained occupied. Not knowing anything else they
start slipping into death.</p><p>Meditation is going to become more and more important in the future.
It has never been so important in the past as it's going to be in the
future. Sannyas is going to be the only way for the future humanity
because it will teach you how to be playful, how to be restful, how to
be without any goals and yet happy.</p><p>So that is your work: drop all tensions, drop all hurring; drop all
goals and destinations. Drop the achieving mind and start enjoying the
moment. Whatsoever you are doing in the moment or not doing --</p><p>start enjoying it so that you can slowly come back to the right place
where really belong, so that you can become more centered. And out of
that centering a perfume arises. That perfume is bliss!</p><p>(to Judith)</p><p>Pramila means the loving one -- and that is the work for you. Become
more and more loving. Love for love's sake. Love unconditionally, with
no expectations, with no hopes -- not even unconscious ones -- that it
will be responded to,</p><p>returned. Love unaddressedly. Love the whole existence. It is one
reality: the trees 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on

partecipate together, we exist in a deep harmony. We go on breathing in
oxigen and breathing out carbon dioxide; trees go on breathing in
carbon-dioxide and breathing out oxygen. Now without trees we will not
be able to exist and without us trees will not be able to exist. We are
joined together, we interpenetrate. And that's how the whole existence
is interlinked.</p><p>So love unaddressedly, the trees, the stars, the mountains, the
people, the animals. The point is not to <em>whom</em> you are loving,
the point is that you are loving. That is the meaning of your name: just
a loving one.</p><p>That is your meditation, and that will be the key for you to open the
doors. It can unlock the very mistery of life and existence.</p><p>(Hansraj, the raya swan)</p><p>The East has tremendous respect for the swan. It has become a symbol
for certain spiritual qualities. The most important quality for a
spiritual person is to constantly remember that god is our home. The
remembrance has to become so deep, has to go to such depths that you
need not remember it deliberately; it goes on resounding in you.</p><p>The myth is that the swan always remembers its home. In India the
home of the wwans is deep in the Himalayas. Only when it is too cold and
the swan cannot survive there does it come to the plains for a few
months. But it never forgets its home; it never becomes entangled here.
It will live on the lakes and the ponds and the rivers for those three
or four months when there is too much snow and life is impossible and
the lake from where the swans come is frozen. But after three or four
months, suddenly one day they start moving back to the Himalayas, as if
a deep remembrance goes on through them, like an undercurrent. Not only
do they remember the place, they remember the exact date when they have
to go</p><p>back. Suddenly, all over India, swans will start moving towards the
Himalayas. The swans are back exactly in time for the lake to be melting
again and things are getting warmer.</p><p>Because of this quality the swan has become symbolic of the religious
man. He has to remember that we are visitors here, guests at the most.
We come from a totally different world and we should not forget about
it.</p><p>Live in the world byt go on remembering god -- that's your work. Live
life in its totality but still never forget for a single moment that god
is our home, that we have to go one day, and that the day is not far
off.</p><p>And when the day comes don't cling. When death comes don't cling to
the world. Go joyously, dancingly, because death in nothing but a
calling of god. You have been called home. It is your invitation, it is
not an enemy.</p><p>Death is a friend -- as much a friend as life is, because both are
given to us from the same source. God gives us life and god gives us
death.</p><p>(to Dick)</p><p>Devasharan means at the feet of God. That's what sannyas is all
about: a surrender, a deep, total surrender, to the feet of God.</p><p>Those feet are not visible. You cannot find them, you cannot touch
them, but you can still surrender to them. The more you surrender, the
more you become aware that they are everywhere. When the surrender is
<em>really</em> total you will find that the whole existence is nothing
but the feet of God. And in that surrender is joy, in that let-go is
beauty. All fight disappears, and with all fight disappearing the ego
dies.</p><p>The ego can exist only if you fight. Surrender is poison to the ego;
hence the emphasis on surrender.</p><p>Fight is food; surrender is poison. And the ego has to die, only then
can you be born. In one sheath there can't be two swords. Either
<em>you</em> can live inside yourself or the ego does. If the ego lives
you have to go underground lives, and the egos are sitting on the
throne. In surrender the ego disappears and your underground self starts
surfacing back to its natural status, its natural state.</p><p>Devasharan means that now you are not more important, only God is
important; that now your life is only to be an instrument of God, a
bamboo flute on his lips. You just have to be hollow and let him sing
the song if he wants. Or if he does not want, then silence is as
beautiful as the song.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on

It is for reference purposes only.]\nLove is the energy that can be transformed into joy; and love is the only energy that we have, there is no other energy available. It is the same energy on different planes. Sex is the crudest form of love energy and God is the highest form of love energy, but it is the same energy, crude, gross, subtle, hard, wordly, spiritual. It is the same energy that moves in all the planes. It is like a ladder: one part of the ladder touches the lowest and the other part, the highest.\nWithout love, life would be impossible, without love the universe itself would be impossible. Things would fall apart; it is love that keeps them glued together.\nThis has been one of the most basic insights of all the mystics of all the ages: that even matter is glued together with love. Atoms are together, molecules are together, not falling apart; some invisible force keeps them together. Science has still to discover that ultimate energy. It has come across a few of its manifestations -- gravitation, electricity -- but these are very gross manifestations. But the day is not far off when science will be able to see deeper and will find that the ultimate source of all energy is love. That day will be a great day for humanity; on that day religion and science will be able to commune with each other because their language will be the same -- that of love.\nI am introducing the language of love to my people. Rejoice because love is possible. Be joyful becaue love is your inner potential. You can rise to the ultimate heights. Nothing is impossible for love because love can even transform itself into god.\n(to Gabriele)\nLove is divine, lust is animal. Many go on confusing lust with love. That is one of the greatest calamities, becaue the person who thinks lust is love remains confined to the world of lust and never rises higher than that. He has no idea that there is a higher plane too. He remains in the basement of his house.\nSex is the basement of the house. It is not the place to live. You can use it for other purposes but it is not your home: your home is above it.\nMan has three planes of being. Lust is animal, but remember it is the crudest form of love. It is not that there is no love present in it but it is very mixed, muddy, polluted by many other things: jealousy, possessiveness, anger. As it becomes a little more refined it becomes human love: less possessive, less jealous, more understanding, more capable of not using the other as a means, more capable of thinking of the other as an end unto himself or herself. And love in its highest form, when it is divine, is prayer. Then there is no possessiveness at all, then there is nothing earthly in it. It becomes an absolutely invisible force.\nAnd when love becomes prayer one comes to feel contentment for the first time. Lust keeps you always hankering, desiring, for more -- for more sensation, for more thrill, for more kick. Human love gives you a little bit of satisfaction. One starts cooling down a little bit of satisfaction, on is not so hot, not so fiery. But prayer is absolutely cool, a cool breeze from the beyond. When it starts blowing it takes you away from the mundane to the sacred. You can open your wings and just float with the wind and it will take you to the ultimate goal of all life.\nAs you go higher in love your life becomes more and more significant. More songs start happening in your heart; more ecstasies are born. And in the ultimate sense of love, when it is godly, you are just a lotus 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nflower, releasing its fragrance, its ecstasy. Then there is no death, no time, no mind; then you are part of eternity. Then there is no fear, of course; when there is no death how can there be fear? There is no anxiety, of course; because when there is no mind how can there be anxiety? There is great trust, contentment, fulfillment.\n(to Brigitte)\nLove is both a strength and a bridge. It is a strenght because it is pure energy, and it is also the bridge, the bridge between man and God, the bridge between the earth and the sky, the bridge between the known and the unknown.\nSeek your strenght in love because it is a very different kind of strenght. Love is power but is not political power, it is religious power -- and there is a great difference. There is not only a difference, they are polar opposites. Political power is that of domination over the other. It tries to reduce the other to a thing to be possessed; it destroyes the soul of the other.\nReligious power, power that comes through love is not violent, it is not aggressive. It does not dominate, it has no idea of reducing the other to a thing. On the contrary it frees the other.\nLove liberates: it helps the other to be himself or herself. Love is the power that knows how to surrender. It knows nothing of conquering. It knows only one way, and that is of surrender. But the beauty and the paradox is that by surrendering one conquers, but then that conquest is not destructive. The other remains absolutely free, more free than ever. The other becomes more of a soul than ever. Love releases him from all his bondages. In the ultimate sense love releases him from the body and the mind too; it makes him a pure spiritual force. But still it gives you great conquest: you disappear, you are no more there as an ego, and when the ego is not there politics is impossible.\nPolitics is the projection of the ego. When the ego is not there, there is a joy, energy flowing, energy communing, energy dancing with other energies, energy meeting and merging. There is great orgasmic joy, and that very orgasmic joyfulness becomes the bridge that takes you from this shore to the other shore. And the other shore is our real home.\n(to Ramo)\nBliss is the way to God. Bliss is the means towards God and also the end; it is the way and the goal, both.\nBe blissful so that you can be more blissful. Start by being blissful so that you can end by being totally blissful. And the first step is the last step. Remember it, it is one of the most fundamental laws of life: the first step is almost half the journey. If you start it wrongly you will arrive home; and the right step means to take it blissfully, dancing, rejoicing.\nSannyas is your first step towards God. Don't be serious about it. Be sincere but don't be serious.\nSeriousness is not really sincerity but pseudo sincerity. And seriousness is a kind of disease; it is illness, it is pathological. Health is never serious. Health is always playful because health is so full of energy, so overflowing with energy, that it naturally has to be a play. One can't help it -- one has to dance and sing, one has to love and laugh.\nMy sannyas starts with laughter, starts with love, starts with being cheerful, starts with being playful, because in the East we conceive of God as the ultimate player and we conceive of existence as his play, leela. It is not a serious affair as it is in the Judaic, Christian, Mohammedan concepts.\nThe Jewish God is really very serious. He does not seem to be a Jew -- he is so serious! Jews have never been so serious. Sometimes it happens: we compensate, we become attracted to the opposite. Jews have been very life- affirmative, their religion has been that of joy. It is only in the tradition of the Judaic religion that Hassidism, something like Hassidism, was possible: dancing, singing, hugging, rejoicing in each other's beings. But their god is very serious. It seems that they have dumped all their seriousness on the god! He is very ferocious: he gets angry about small things.\nAdam and Eve had not done much wrong, they were just being children. A little bit of disobedience is part of being a child, is part of being innocent. They were simply being innocent, they were not sinners. Out of curiosity they ate the fruit which was denied to them, and when you deny somebody something --\nparticularly children -- they become very interested in it. The whole\nresponsability is God's: he should not have denied it to them in the first place. But he denied it: \"Don't eat from the tree of knowledge and don't eat 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nfrom the tree of life\" - two trees he was very much afraid of.\nAnd the moment Adam and Eve had eaten from the tree of knowledge he drove them out of heaven, out of paradise, because of the fear that now they would try the other tree. And once they ate from the other tree they would become immortal, they would be like gods. That means that God felt jealous. They have become half like God because now they know, they are no more immortal then there would be no difference between god and them: they would know, God knows; they would be immortal, God is immortal. So a great jealousy arose in God's mind. It was out of jealousy that they were thrown out of paradise.\nThis is not a very healthy concept of God. He could not forgive such a small thing .… Where is his kindness, where is his compassion, where is his love? But the whole reason is that he is serious, too serious\n-- like an old-type headmaster.\nBut the eastern concept of God is totally different: he is hilarious. He laughs, he plays; he is ready to forgive all sins, forgivness is his very nature.\nSo don't be serious -- that is going to be your work. Seriousness is your main characteristic; that has to be dropped. You have to become non-serious; take life more as fun. And don't be worried: the fruits that are denied are sweeter. Eat them, and with no fear because God is love and god is compassion: all is going to be forgiven. In the end the saints are going to be very miserable: when they see that sinners have also entered heaven and that they are enjoying the same privileges as the saints, they are bound to repent that for the whole of their lives they were fools! These sinners enjoyed the world and now they are enjoying paradise too. And in fact the sinners will be able to enjoy paradise more because they will know the art of enjoying it! Just think: even if a man who has been a saint for his whole life gets into paradise, what is he going to do there? He will\njust be at a loss. He will go on doing his old tricks: standing on his head, fasting, et cetera.\nThat's what he knows!\nSinners will really be the possessors of paradise. Once they enter they will enjoy paradise because they will know how to enjoy. They will drink to their heart's content, they will dance, they will sing. Now there is no fear, no responsability, no death who can prevent them from dancing and singing and rejoicing?\nMy whole effort here is to prepare you for paradise. So we are creating a little bit of paradise here.\nEnjoy! Nothing is denied; all is accepted and affirmed. (to Sangam)\nIn India a place where three rivers meet becomes a sacred palce. It is a metaphor, because man is a meeting place of three forces: the physical, the psychological, and the spiritual. And when these three forces really meet there is great joy, great bliss.\nOrdinarily we live in compartments: body lives in one comportments, mind in another, soul in another.\nThe body is not aware of the mind, the mind is not aware of the body, the soul is not known to the mind, the body is completely oblivious of the soul. The are together but are not even introduced to each other.\nThe first step of meditation is to bring them closer to be introduced to each other, to be linked in a kind of deep friendship so that a merger becomes possible. And when all three dimensions merge into one point the fourth is born. Out of the meeting of the three the fourth is born, and that fourth is called God. In India we simply call him the fourth: turiya, the fourth. We don't give him any name. These three have names but the fourth has no name, The fourth is transcendental.\nThe whole work of religion consists of creating an alchemy in which your body melts into the mind, the mind melts into the soul, the soul melts into the mind, the mind melts into the soul, the soul melts into the body. And by and by, slowly slowly, they become one integrated phenomenon. Hence our work is three-\ndimensional: we work on the body through many techniques; we work on the mind through many therapies; we work on the soul through many meditations.\nFor the body there is Rolfing, Acupunture, Shiatsu, Karate. These are techniques to help the body to come closer to integration. And then are all kinds of psychotherapies available; they are means to bring the mind to a clarity; to give mind a certain order and discipline out of confusion and chaos. And then there are meditations -- Vipassana, Zazen, and other meditations -- which make you aware of the soul. All these three together slowly slowly mold you into one unity. That unity leads to the fourth, and the fourth is the name of God.\nHow long will you be here? 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\n(her replay is inaudible)\nBe here till the fourth happens! (to Prashanta)\nWhen are you living? I don't know.\nMm mm.\nI was ready to go but now I don't know.\nThen don't go! What is the point of going? Or if you want to finish things there, finish things and come back.\nI'm not sure. Mm?\nI'm confused now.\nNo, then it is better to go. If there is confusion, go, because I only want people here when they are no more confused about this going business. Go -- no problem. First go; soon this confusion will be finished.\nHere you are accepted only when there is no problem about going, when it has been settled completely.\nOnly then is useful to be here, otherwise it is not going to be of any use. If the mind goes on thinking about going then it is better to go and be finished. Soon it will be finished. Don't be worried -- I will take care.\nJust go, mm? Okay.\nIf even one percent of confusion remains my suggestion is: go. When you are one hundred percent here then only be here. Otherwise it is not of much use, because I can only work on you when you are at the one-hundred-degree point; below that, work is not possible. And that point will come soon.\nEverybody goes through this confusion -- that's natural. The only way to get rid of it is to go. If you remain here this will remain: you will go on thinking of going there. Going there you will see that there is nothing. You unnecessaryly .… The whole futility will be clear to you.\n[Here follows a line which has not been xerocopied]\n... finished. When you see the point absolutely clearly, come back! Hello, Sambuddho. When did you arrive?\nA few days ago.\nGood! And how long will you be here?\nThat's the miracle: I can be here forever now. (Tears) Be here forever, mm? There is no need to go anywhere.\nI just want to tank you.\nJust be here! Come close to me, turn towards Mukta and raise your hands. (touches his forehead) You are one-hundred per cent ready -- there is no need to go anywhere!\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nScriptures in Silence and Sermons in Stones Chapter #9\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2836","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/scriptures_in_silence_and_sermons_in_stone/part8/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/scriptures_in_silence_and_sermons_in_stone/>Scriptures In Silence And Sermons In Stone</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>14 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2836 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Scriptures_In_Silence_And_Sermons_In_Stone/part8.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part7>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

anxiety? There is great trust, contentment, fulfillment.</p><p>(to Brigitte)</p><p>Love is both a strength and a bridge. It is a strenght because it is
pure energy, and it is also the bridge, the bridge between man and God,
the bridge between the earth and the sky, the bridge between the known
and the unknown.</p><p>Seek your strenght in love because it is a very different kind of
strenght. Love <em>is</em> power but is not political power, it is
religious power -- and there is a great difference. There is not only a
difference, they are polar opposites. Political power is that of
domination over the other. It tries to reduce the other to a thing to be
possessed; it destroyes the soul of the other.</p><p>Religious power, power that comes through love is not violent, it is
not aggressive. It does not dominate, it has no idea of reducing the
other to a thing. On the contrary it frees the other.</p><p>Love liberates: it helps the other to be himself or herself. Love is
the power that knows how to surrender. It knows nothing of conquering.
It knows only one way, and that is of surrender. But the beauty and the
paradox is that by surrendering one conquers, but then that conquest is
not destructive. The other remains absolutely free, more free than ever.
The other becomes more of a soul than ever. Love releases him from all
his bondages. In the ultimate sense love releases him from the body and
the mind too; it makes him a pure spiritual force. But still it gives
you great conquest: <em>you</em> disappear, you are no more there as an
ego, and when the ego is not there politics is impossible.</p><p>Politics is the projection of the ego. When the ego is not there,
there is a joy, energy flowing, energy communing, energy dancing with
other energies, energy meeting and merging. There is great orgasmic joy,
and that very orgasmic joyfulness becomes the bridge that takes you from
this shore to the other shore. And the other shore is our real home.</p><p>(to Ramo)</p><p>Bliss is the way to God. Bliss is the means towards God and also the
end; it is the way and the goal, both.</p><p>Be blissful so that you can be more blissful. Start by being blissful
so that you can end by being totally blissful. And the first step is the
last step. Remember it, it is one of the most fundamental laws of life:
the first step is almost half the journey. If you start it wrongly you
will arrive home; and the right step means to take it blissfully,
dancing, rejoicing.</p><p>Sannyas is your first step towards God. Don't be serious about it. Be
sincere but don't be serious.</p><p>Seriousness is not really sincerity but pseudo sincerity. And
seriousness is a kind of disease; it is illness, it is pathological.
Health is never serious. Health is always playful because health is so
full of energy, so overflowing with energy, that it naturally has to be
a play. One can't help it -- one has to dance and sing, one has to love
and laugh.</p><p>My sannyas starts with laughter, starts with love, starts with being
cheerful, starts with being playful, because in the East we conceive of
God as the ultimate player and we conceive of existence as his play,
<em>leela</em>. It is not a serious affair as it is in the Judaic,
Christian, Mohammedan concepts.</p><p>The Jewish God is really <em>very</em> serious. He does not seem to
be a Jew -- he is so serious! Jews have never been so serious. Sometimes
it happens: we compensate, we become attracted to the opposite. Jews
have been very life- affirmative, their religion has been that of joy.
It is only in the tradition of the Judaic religion that Hassidism,
something like Hassidism, was possible: dancing, singing, hugging,
rejoicing in each other's beings. But their god is very serious. It
seems that they have dumped all their seriousness on the god! He is very
ferocious: he gets angry about small things.</p><p>Adam and Eve had not done much wrong, they were just being children.
A little bit of disobedience is part of being a child, is part of being
innocent. They were simply being innocent, they were not sinners. Out of
curiosity they ate the fruit which was denied to them, and when you deny
somebody something --</p><p>particularly children -- they become very interested in it. The
whole</p><p>responsability is God's: he should not have denied it to them in the
first place. But he denied it: "Don't eat from the tree of knowledge and
don't eat 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>from the tree of life" - two trees he was very much afraid of.</p><p>And the moment Adam and Eve had eaten from the tree of knowledge he
drove them out of heaven, out of paradise, because of the fear that now
they would try the other tree. And once they ate from the other tree
they would become immortal, they would be like gods. That means that God
felt jealous. They have become half like God because now they know, they
are no more immortal then there would be no difference between god and
them: they would know, God knows; they would be immortal, God is
immortal. So a great jealousy arose in God's mind. It was out of
jealousy that they were thrown out of paradise.</p><p>This is not a very healthy concept of God. He could not forgive such
a small thing .… Where is his kindness, where is his compassion, where
is his love? But the whole reason is that he is serious, too serious</p><p>-- like an old-type headmaster.</p><p>But the eastern concept of God is totally different: he is hilarious.
He laughs, he plays; he is ready to forgive all sins, forgivness is his
very nature.</p><p>So don't be serious -- that is going to be your work. Seriousness is
your main characteristic; that has to be dropped. You have to become
non-serious; take life more as fun. And don't be worried: the fruits
that are denied are sweeter. Eat them, and with no fear because God is
love and god <em>is</em> compassion: <em>all</em> is going to be
forgiven. In the end the saints are going to be very miserable: when
they see that sinners have also entered heaven and that they are
enjoying the same privileges as the saints, they are bound to repent
that for the whole of their lives they were fools! These sinners enjoyed
the world and now they are enjoying paradise too. And in fact the
sinners will be able to enjoy paradise more because they will know the
art of enjoying it! Just think: even if a man who has been a saint for
his whole life gets into paradise, what is he going to do there? He
will</p><p>just be at a loss. He will go on doing his old tricks: standing on
his head, fasting, et cetera.</p><p>That's what he knows!</p><p>Sinners will <em>really</em> be the possessors of paradise. Once they
enter they will enjoy paradise because they will know how to enjoy. They
will drink to their heart's content, they will dance, they will sing.
Now there is no fear, no responsability, no death who can prevent them
from dancing and singing and rejoicing?</p><p>My whole effort here is to prepare you for paradise. So we are
creating a little bit of paradise here.</p><p>Enjoy! Nothing is denied; all is accepted and affirmed. (to
Sangam)</p><p>In India a place where three rivers meet becomes a sacred palce. It
is a metaphor, because man is a meeting place of three forces: the
physical, the psychological, and the spiritual. And when these three
forces <em>really</em> meet there is great joy, great bliss.</p><p>Ordinarily we live in compartments: body lives in one comportments,
mind in another, soul in another.</p><p>The body is not aware of the mind, the mind is not aware of the body,
the soul is not known to the mind, the body is completely oblivious of
the soul. The <em>are</em> together but are not even introduced to each
other.</p><p>The first step of meditation is to bring them closer to be introduced
to each other, to be linked in a kind of deep friendship so that a
merger becomes possible. And when all three dimensions merge into one
point the fourth is born. Out of the meeting of the three the fourth is
born, and that fourth is called God. In India we simply call him the
fourth: <em>turiya</em>, the fourth. We don't give him any name. These
three have names but the fourth has no name, The fourth is
transcendental.</p><p>The whole work of religion consists of creating an alchemy in which
your body melts into the mind, the mind melts into the soul, the soul
melts into the mind, the mind melts into the soul, the soul melts into
the body. And by and by, slowly slowly, they become one integrated
phenomenon. Hence our work is three-</p><p>dimensional: we work on the body through many techniques; we work on
the mind through many therapies; we work on the soul through many
meditations.</p><p>For the body there is Rolfing, Acupunture, Shiatsu, Karate. These are
techniques to help the body to come closer to integration. And then are
all kinds of psychotherapies available; they are means to bring the mind
to a clarity; to give mind a certain order and discipline out of
confusion and chaos. And then there are meditations -- Vipassana, Zazen,
and other meditations -- which make you aware of the soul. All these
three together slowly slowly mold you into one unity. That unity leads
to the fourth, and the fourth is the name of God.</p><p>How long will you be here? 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on

It is for reference purposes only.]\nSambodh means right awareness. That is one of the most fundamental keys.\nMore people have become enlightened through that key than by any other. Right awareness means not only awareness -- because awareness can become a strain -\n- right awareness means awareness without any strain, relaxed. One can try to be aware but can create tension on the way, and that tension will destroy the whole work. So these two things have to be remembered: awareness with no strain, with no tension.\nOur very word 'attention' has tension in it, because whenever we try to be attentive we become tense, but that tension destroys the whole beauty of it. Right awareness means attention without tension, a relaxed kind of watchfulness, just\nseeing, not making an effort, not striving; an effortless awareness. In the beginning it looks very paradoxical -- effortlessness and awareness -- but once you start working on it, slowly slowly the knack is learned. It is a knack. And once you have learned the knack, once you have known even a single moment of awareness without tension, you are on the right track; you will never be the same person again.\nA sannyasin has to create as much fire in himself as possible. He has to become just fuel. He has to become such an intense fire that everything is consumed in him: the whole past, the whole future, time itself. Life is consumed in it, death is consumed in it, the idea of I and thou is consumed in it. The mind itself is consumed with all its philosophies, ideologies. And when the fire is total and all is consumed only god is left behind. God is the purest gold. We are made of god but we are carrying so many impurities; a fire is needed to purify the gold. Hence I have chosen the colour of fire for sannyasins' robes. It is just a symbol that you have to pass through a fire. The fire has to be inner; and nobody else can create it except you. It is your very deep effort to transform yourself that will ignite it.\nOnce it is ignited it becomes huge, and once it is ignited it cannot be put out. Then it has the quality of the eternal.\nGod is our only security. Money, power, prestige -- nothing is secure; family, friends, even life itself --\nnothing is secure. We are surrounded by insecurity. But there is one thing which is secure, and that one thing cannot be found anywhere outside; that one thing can only be found at the innermost core. God resides there, that is God's dwelling place: the heart of your hearts! And to know God is to go beyond all security; then everything is safe and secure. And when everything is safe and secure, misery disappears naturally, anxiety disappears, and great bliss arises. That bliss is the deepest longing of your being.\nInka comes from 'ing'. In Norse mythology Ing is the goddess of fertility, prosperity, peace -- in short, of creativity.\nBliss is a by-product of creativity. Bliss is known only by those who are creative people. It is not something that you can catch hold of, it is not a thing at all. It is the moment of exhilaration when something is created by you, because in that\nmoment you disappear and God appears -- because all creation is through him, by him. God is another name for the energy that we call creativity.\nSo whenever you create anything -- poetry, painting, sculpture -- you disappear, God starts functioning through you. And in those moments of egolessness there is joy, there is bliss. Once this is understood one can transform one's whole life into creativity.…\nIt does not matter whether you become famous or not, whether anybody appreciates your creations or 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nnot; that is secondary, absolutely non-essential. The essential thing is that while creating something you disappear and for a moment God takes possession of you. That being possessed by God is bliss.\nVeet means transcendence. Markus means a warrior, a warlike person, martial.\nThe full name will mean: go beyond the qualities that make one warlike. Transcend those qualities because they are the cause of all misery, violence, anger, hatred, ego; these are the very pillars of hell.\nInstead of being warlike, be peaceful, be loving, be human, be compassionate.\nTo be warlike is to be animal-like; to be peaceful is godlike. And man can be both: either he can fall below humanity and can function as an animal or he can transcend humanity and function like a god. man is only a bridge between animal and god. And remember that we have to become gods. Less than that is not going to fulfill you, make you blissful, with less than that you will remain in anguish, something will go on being missed. When one becomes godlike all is fulfilled, a great rest descends and great silence prevails. In those moments of silence and grace one knows what like is all about.\nAnand means bliss. Theo means god's gift.\nThe most difficult thing in life is to receive a gift, because it goes against the ego. It is easier to give, very easy to give but to receive is very difficult. And to receive when you don't deserve... then it becomes even more difficult. and we don't deserve. We have not earned it, we are not worthy of bliss, but God goes on giving -- not because we deserve but because he has in such abundance.\nThe moment you receive his bliss he feels thankful to you: you have unburdened him, you have taken a little weight from his being. But remember, it is very difficult to receive a gift. It feels like a humiliation, one feels a little embarrassed. And a sannyasin has to learn that: how to receive a gift in great joy and celebration, because the more you become receptive, the more will be given to you. If you are totally receptive the whole of heaven can descend into your being this very moment, herenow. All that is needed on your part is to be absolutely open and ready.\nThe most godly quality in life is bliss and the most ungodly quality is misery; hence the miserable person cannot have any bridge with God. It is impossible. He can pray, he can go to church, he can read the Bible, but it is all futile because misery makes you closed, misery makes you shrink. Bliss opens you up, bliss expands you, and only in that expanding consciousness can be bridged with God.\nWhether you pray or not, whether you go to church or not, whether you read the scriptures or not, whether you are formally a religious person or not -- all those things are irrelevant.\nIf your consciousness is expanding, sooner or later you will have the connection, the communion. It is bound to happen, it is inevitable; hence I say that bliss is the most godly quality.\nThey say that in hell people are in great misery. The truth is just the opposite: hell has nothing to do with misery. It is not that in hell you are in misery but that whenever you are in misery, that is hell. And they say that in heaven everybody is blissful; again they are wrong: heaven has nothing to do with bliss.\nWhenever you are in bliss you are in heaven, heaven is in you. Heaven and hell are inner states.\nRemind yourself of it again and again, that bliss is the key. And be blissful! There is so much to be blissful about. Just look at life and you will be surprised:\nthere are so many things that one need not search for anything more. So much beauty, so much splendor, so much grace all around.… These are all expressions of God. And as you start becoming cheerful, as you start becoming a song more and more, you will see: God is coming closer. You need not have any other proof.\nProofs are asked for only by foolish people; the wise ones experience, the fools argue.\nLove needs great courage. In fact nothing needs more courage than love because the basic requirement of love is to die as an ego. Only when you dissolve your ego does love start flowing in you. The ego is the barrier and it needs guts to drop it. One clings, one thinks that one is nothing but the ego; hence one feels great fear: \"What is going to happen to me is I drop my ego? -- I will lose my identity.\"\nYes, there will be a time when you will lose your identity, the old identity, the false identity, an interval of time when you will not know who you are, and then the true identity will evolve.\nIn Zen they say: Before you meditate rivers are rivers, mountains are mountains; when you meditate rivers are no more rivers, mountains are no more mountains; and when the meditation is completed, when you have attained it, rivers are again rivers, mountains are again mountains.\nThere is a gap between the two -- the old leaving and the new coming -- which is going to be a little 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nchaotic; hence the need of a master to help during those days, to keep on holding your hand, to go on encouraging you: \"Don't be afraid. The dawn is not far off. Don't turn back, look ahead... because there is no way back. Life never goes back, it is always a forward movement.\"\nBuddha says, charaiveti, charaiveti: Go on, go on -- until you have arrived at the\npoint where there is no desire left. That is the moment of fulfillment, of bliss, of benediction.\nBliss makes you a king: it crowns you. Without bliss one is just a beggar, and to be a beggar is misery; it hurts. But even the richest people are beggars. They are rich beggars, of course, but their minds are continuously desiring more and more. that's what makes one a beggar. Only a desireless person is a king.\nAnd the moment you are desireless you are totally blissful, because bliss is not something to be achieved, it is your very nature. You are missing it because of so many desires, you are being pulled in so many directions. You are so occupied with the desires that you cannot look within.\nThe moment desires are dropped you are bound to see your nature. A great well- being arises in you --\nand that is the ultimate goal.\nTruth is available only to the innocent consciousness: a consciousness which is as innocent as a child, a consciousness which knows nothing. When you know, your mirror is full of dust, knowledge gathers dust like a mirror. When you don't know anything you are full of wonder and awe, your mirror is clean. and that clean mirror reflects the truth.\nJesus says: Be like a small child, because unless you are like a child you will not enter into my kingdom of god.\nPurity is when you live in a choiceless awareness: when you are neither concerned with the good nor the bad, when you don't divide at all, when you accept everything as divine, when divisions have ben dropped, when you see only the one. even in the devil you see God and even in darkness, light, and even in death, eternal life. When the ordinary ways of seeing things as dual are dropped, you become pure because then nothing can contaminate you. That is the ultimate state of consciousness.… We have to transcend all duality: moral- immoral, good-bad, life-death, summer-winter. All have to be transcended so that one can see the one. One can see the one in so many millions of forms; one is capable of recognizing the one wherever, in whatsoever form he appears.\nIt is possible. All that is needed is a little effort to become more awake, a little effort to be aware and choiceless; just sitting inside, watching the mind, not\nchoosing anything. The traffic passes on, you sit by the side unconcerned, cool. Slowly slowly a purity starts descending on you. That purity is liberation.\nKalyani: one who is a blessing to existence.\nOne can be a blessing to existence only if one is full of bliss, full of light, full of god, because you can give to others only that which you already have.\nIf you are miserable you cannot make others happy; you can try, but whatsoever you do will be wrong.\nYour intentions will be good but the consequences will be bad. Hence the first thing to be done is to be blissful, to be fragrant. Then naturally the fragrance starts reaching others, starts making them also sing, celebrate.\nPeople are hard. Life prepares them to be hard because life prepares them to fight. Slowly slowly they lose all inner softness; they become rocklike. And a rocklike person is a dead person. He lives only in name, he does not truly live.\nTrue life consists of softness, vulnerability, openness. Don't be afraid of existence: existence cares for you, loves you. There is no need to fight with God: God is already ready to give more than you can ever ask for or you can ever imagine. But God can give only if you are soft, vulnerable. If you are porous then he can enter from everywhere.\nBe porous, be available to existence, unafraid. There is no need to be afraid. It is our existence, we belong to it, it belongs to us.\nLove is always blessed by god and always condemned by the society. The society is against love, god is for love; hence deep down the society is against god. It pretends to be religious but it is only a facade. The religion that exists in the society is a Sunday-religion, a formality, something very pseudo, phony.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThe real religion is totally different. But the moment you are really religious the society is absolutely against you because you become a danger to the society -- to the state, to the church, to all the vested interests, to all the powers that are exploiting, oppressing people.\nJesus was pure love. He was blessed by god, but crucified by the society. Love is always crucified by the society. And society has created por substitutes for love -\n- marriage, etcetera. Those are just plastic substitutes to keep you engaged, toys to keep you occupied so that you don't feel the need for real love. But real love is a totally different phenomenon, and it is not ordinarily available unless you raise the level of your consciousness.\nTo attain to real love you have to go through many transformations, because love is the ultimate flowering of your consciousness. It is no ordinary phenomenon. That it happens is a miracle. That it happens is magic, but whenever it does happen blessings shower on you from god.\nGod is not available through thinking, he is available only through feeling. One cannot connect oneself with god through the head. The only possible bridge is through the heart. One can argue for years or for lives, but one will not come to any conclusion about god. Logic is not in that direction, that dimension. It is not logic but love that brings you to a conclusion. In fact logic never brings one to any conclusion, it goes around in circles. Love takes a quantum leap and immediately arrives at a conclusion. It is not through a process, it is intuitive, it is sudden.\nGod has disappeared from the world for the simple reason that love has disappeared, and god cannot be brought back to the world unless we start creating more and more vibrations for love, unless we change the milieu that exists on earth today, the atmosphere, the neo-sphere. It is very logical, scientific, but it is absolutely anti-god. Even those who believe in god believe only through logic. And to believe in logic is not to believe at all, it is worthless. Unless it is a love affair, a mad, mad love affair, it means nothing.\nI teach the madness that love brings and the sanity that love brings. They are the same thing, two sides of the same coin. The world will think you insane, and those who know, they will think you sane.\nPrayer has to be something absolutely individual. It has to be spontaneous, it has\nnot to be learned. A learned prayer is a false prayer. Then you are repeating like a parrot. It is meaningless, senseless -- empty words. But when a prayer arises in your heart, when it has something of you in it then it has tremendous significance. Then it is not a tale told by an idiot, full of fury and noise, signifying nothing. It has tremendous meaning and music.\nOne has to learn to communicate with existence. Talk to the stars, talk to the rivers, talk to the trees, talk to the rocks. And don't feel embarrassed because this is how god has manifested himself. Everything that is, is a manifestation of god. Start communication with the manifest god and only then one day will you be able to communicate with the unmanifest. Start with the visible and then you can take a quantum leap into the invisible. Talk to the earth, to the grass.\nIt may not look religious at all in the beginning, but just saying hullo to a tree has something beautiful in it, something spiritual, something holy, because you recognize the spirit of the tree, you recognize the presence of the tree, you don't ignore it. And if a person can learn only one thing -- not to ignore god in all his manifestations -- then ignorance disappears and wisdom arises, arises from your innermost core.\nThe very idea of fighting and conquering is ugly. The part cannot win against the whole. It is utterly stupid. The part can only win with the whole, through the whole. The part can only win if it allows the whole to win through it -- allowing god to function through you, letting his will be your will, not having any separate will of one's own, not having any separate goal, destiny of one's own, moving with the whole in total accord, flowing with the whole wherever it leads.\nIn that let-go all fear, anxiety, anguish, disappears. and when there is no fear there is love, and when there is no anguish there is joy. And when you are no more separate there is no death.\nMan never really dies. Nothing dies. The very idea that we are separate creates, as a by-product, the phenomenon of death. In the first place the idea of being separate is false and so is death, its by-product.\nDeath is one of the most false things in existence, but it looks very real if the ego is there; it is the shadow of the ego. Drop the ego -- and dropping the ego is the beginning, the beginning of a tremendously significant pilgrimage. And in the very first step, you have arrived. The first step is the last step. In dropping the\nego one becomes victorious. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nScriptures in Silence and Sermons in Stones Chapter #29\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"3354","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/scriptures_in_silence_and_sermons_in_stone/part28/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/scriptures_in_silence_and_sermons_in_stone/>Scriptures In Silence And Sermons In Stone</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>16 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;3354 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Scriptures_In_Silence_And_Sermons_In_Stone/part28.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part27>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

is learned. It <em>is</em> a knack. And once you have learned the knack,
once you have known even a single moment of awareness without tension,
you are on the right track; you will never be the same person again.</p><p>A sannyasin has to create as much fire in himself as possible. He has
to become just fuel. He has to become such an intense fire that
everything is consumed in him: the whole past, the whole future, time
itself. Life is consumed in it, death is consumed in it, the idea of I
and thou is consumed in it. The mind itself is consumed with all its
philosophies, ideologies. And when the fire is total and all is consumed
only god is left behind. God is the purest gold. We are made of god but
we are carrying so many impurities; a fire is needed to purify the gold.
Hence I have chosen the colour of fire for sannyasins' robes. It is just
a symbol that you have to pass through a fire. The fire has to be inner;
and nobody else can create it except you. It is your very deep effort to
transform yourself that will ignite it.</p><p>Once it is ignited it becomes huge, and once it is ignited it cannot
be put out. Then it has the quality of the eternal.</p><p>God is our only security. Money, power, prestige -- nothing is
secure; family, friends, even life itself --</p><p>nothing is secure. We are surrounded by insecurity. But there is one
thing which is secure, and that one thing cannot be found anywhere
outside; that one thing can only be found at the innermost core. God
resides there, that is God's dwelling place: the heart of your hearts!
And to know God is to go beyond all security; then everything is safe
and secure. And when everything is safe and secure, misery disappears
naturally, anxiety disappears, and great bliss arises. That bliss is the
deepest longing of your being.</p><p>Inka comes from 'ing'. In Norse mythology Ing is the goddess of
fertility, prosperity, peace -- in short, of creativity.</p><p>Bliss is a by-product of creativity. Bliss is known only by those who
are creative people. It is not something that you can catch hold of, it
is not a thing at all. It is the moment of exhilaration when something
is created by you, because in that</p><p>moment you disappear and God appears -- because all creation is
through him, by him. God is another name for the energy that we call
creativity.</p><p>So whenever you create anything -- poetry, painting, sculpture -- you
disappear, God starts functioning through you. And in those moments of
egolessness there is joy, there is bliss. Once this is understood one
can transform one's whole life into creativity.…</p><p>It does not matter whether you become famous or not, whether anybody
appreciates your creations or 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on

is that while creating something you disappear and for a moment God
takes possession of you. That being possessed by God is bliss.</p><p>Veet means transcendence. Markus means a warrior, a warlike person,
martial.</p><p>The full name will mean: go beyond the qualities that make one
warlike. Transcend those qualities because they are the cause of all
misery, violence, anger, hatred, ego; these are the very pillars of
hell.</p><p>Instead of being warlike, be peaceful, be loving, be human, be
compassionate.</p><p>To be warlike is to be animal-like; to be peaceful is godlike. And
man can be both: either he can fall below humanity and can function as
an animal or he can transcend humanity and function like a god. man is
only a bridge between animal and god. And remember that we <em>have</em>
to become gods. Less than that is not going to fulfill you, make you
blissful, with less than that you will remain in anguish, something will
go on being missed. When one becomes godlike all is fulfilled, a great
rest descends and great silence prevails. In those moments of silence
and grace one knows what like is all about.</p><p>Anand means bliss. Theo means god's gift.</p><p>The most difficult thing in life is to receive a gift, because it
goes against the ego. It is easier to give, very easy to give but to
receive is very difficult. And to receive when you don't deserve... then
it becomes even more difficult. and we don't deserve. We have not earned
it, we are not worthy of bliss, but God goes on giving -- not because we
deserve but because he has in such abundance.</p><p>The moment you receive his bliss he feels thankful to you: you have
unburdened him, you have taken a little weight from his being. But
remember, it is very difficult to receive a gift. It feels like a
humiliation, one feels a little embarrassed. And a sannyasin has to
learn that: how to receive a gift in great joy and celebration, because
the more you become receptive, the more will be given to you. If you are
totally receptive the whole of heaven can descend into your being this
very moment, herenow. All that is needed on your part is to be
absolutely open and ready.</p><p>The most godly quality in life is bliss and the most ungodly quality
is misery; hence the miserable person cannot have any bridge with God.
It is impossible. He can pray, he can go to church, he can read the
Bible, but it is all futile because misery makes you closed, misery
makes you shrink. Bliss opens you up, bliss expands you, and only in
that expanding consciousness can be bridged with God.</p><p>Whether you pray or not, whether you go to church or not, whether you
read the scriptures or not, whether you are formally a religious person
or not -- all those things are irrelevant.</p><p>If your consciousness is expanding, sooner or later you will have the
connection, the communion. It is bound to happen, it is inevitable;
hence I say that bliss is the most godly quality.</p><p>They say that in hell people are in great misery. The truth is just
the opposite: hell has nothing to do with misery. It is not that in hell
you are in misery but that whenever you are in misery, that is hell. And
they say that in heaven everybody is blissful; again they are wrong:
heaven has nothing to do with bliss.</p><p>Whenever you are in bliss you are in heaven, heaven is in you. Heaven
and hell are inner states.</p><p>Remind yourself of it again and again, that bliss is the key. And be
blissful! There is so much to be blissful about. Just look at life and
you will be surprised:</p><p>there are so many things that one need not search for anything more.
So much beauty, so much splendor, so much grace all around.… These are
all expressions of God. And as you start becoming cheerful, as you start
becoming a song more and more, you will see: God is coming closer. You
need not have any other proof.</p><p>Proofs are asked for only by foolish people; the wise ones
experience, the fools argue.</p><p>Love needs great courage. In fact nothing needs more courage than
love because the basic requirement of love is to die as an ego. Only
when you dissolve your ego does love start flowing in you. The ego is
the barrier and it needs guts to drop it. One clings, one thinks that
one is nothing but the ego; hence one feels great fear: "What is going
to happen to me is I drop my ego? -- I will lose my identity."</p><p>Yes, there will be a time when you will lose your identity, the old
identity, the false identity, an interval of time when you will not know
who you are, and then the true identity will evolve.</p><p>In Zen they say: Before you meditate rivers are rivers, mountains are
mountains; when you meditate rivers are no more rivers, mountains are no
more mountains; and when the meditation is completed, when you have
attained it, rivers are again rivers, mountains are again mountains.</p><p>There is a gap between the two -- the old leaving and the new coming
-- which is going to be a little 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on

keep on holding your hand, to go on encouraging you: "Don't be afraid.
The dawn is not far off. Don't turn back, look ahead... because there is
no way back. Life never goes back, it is always a forward movement."</p><p>Buddha says, <em>charaiveti, charaiveti</em>: Go on, go on -- until
you have arrived at the</p><p>point where there is no desire left. That is the moment of
fulfillment, of bliss, of benediction.</p><p>Bliss makes you a king: it crowns you. Without bliss one is just a
beggar, and to be a beggar is misery; it hurts. But even the richest
people are beggars. They are rich beggars, of course, but their minds
are continuously desiring more and more. that's what makes one a beggar.
Only a desireless person is a king.</p><p>And the moment you are desireless you are totally blissful, because
bliss is not something to be achieved, it is your very nature. You are
missing it because of so many desires, you are being pulled in so many
directions. You are so occupied with the desires that you cannot look
within.</p><p>The moment desires are dropped you are bound to see your nature. A
great well- being arises in you --</p><p>and that is the ultimate goal.</p><p>Truth is available only to the innocent consciousness: a
consciousness which is as innocent as a child, a consciousness which
knows nothing. When you know, your mirror is full of dust, knowledge
gathers dust like a mirror. When you don't know anything you are full of
wonder and awe, your mirror is clean. and that clean mirror reflects the
truth.</p><p>Jesus says: Be like a small child, because unless you are like a
child you will not enter into my kingdom of god.</p><p>Purity is when you live in a choiceless awareness: when you are
neither concerned with the good nor the bad, when you don't divide at
all, when you accept everything as divine, when divisions have ben
dropped, when you see only the one. even in the devil you see God and
even in darkness, light, and even in death, eternal life. When the
ordinary ways of seeing things as dual are dropped, you become pure
because then nothing can contaminate you. That is the ultimate state of
consciousness.… We have to transcend all duality: moral- immoral,
good-bad, life-death, summer-winter. All have to be transcended so that
one can see the one. One can see the one in so many millions of forms;
one is capable of recognizing the one wherever, in whatsoever form he
appears.</p><p>It is possible. All that is needed is a little effort to become more
awake, a little effort to be aware and choiceless; just sitting inside,
watching the mind, not</p><p>choosing anything. The traffic passes on, you sit by the side
unconcerned, cool. Slowly slowly a purity starts descending on you. That
purity is liberation.</p><p>Kalyani: one who is a blessing to existence.</p><p>One can be a blessing to existence only if one is full of bliss, full
of light, full of god, because you can give to others only that which
you already have.</p><p>If you are miserable you cannot make others happy; you can try, but
whatsoever you do will be wrong.</p><p>Your intentions will be good but the consequences will be bad. Hence
the first thing to be done is to be blissful, to be fragrant. Then
naturally the fragrance starts reaching others, starts making them also
sing, celebrate.</p><p>People are hard. Life prepares them to be hard because life prepares
them to fight. Slowly slowly they lose all inner softness; they become
rocklike. And a rocklike person is a dead person. He lives only in name,
he does not truly live.</p><p>True life consists of softness, vulnerability, openness. Don't be
afraid of existence: existence cares for you, loves you. There is no
need to fight with God: God is already ready to give more than you can
ever ask for or you can ever imagine. But God can give only if you are
soft, vulnerable. If you are porous then he can enter from
everywhere.</p><p>Be porous, be available to existence, unafraid. There is no need to
be afraid. It is our existence, we belong to it, it belongs to us.</p><p>Love is always blessed by god and always condemned by the society.
The society is against love, god is for love; hence deep down the
society is against god. It pretends to be religious but it is only a
facade. The religion that exists in the society is a Sunday-religion, a
formality, something very pseudo, phony.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on

religious the society is absolutely against you because you become a
danger to the society -- to the state, to the church, to all the vested
interests, to all the powers that are exploiting, oppressing people.</p><p>Jesus was pure love. He was blessed by god, but crucified by the
society. Love is always crucified by the society. And society has
created por substitutes for love -</p><p>- marriage, etcetera. Those are just plastic substitutes to keep you
engaged, toys to keep you occupied so that you don't feel the need for
real love. But real love is a totally different phenomenon, and it is
not ordinarily available unless you raise the level of your
consciousness.</p><p>To attain to real love you have to go through many transformations,
because love is the ultimate flowering of your consciousness. It is no
ordinary phenomenon. That it happens is a miracle. That it happens is
magic, but whenever it does happen blessings shower on you from god.</p><p>God is not available through thinking, he is available only through
feeling. One cannot connect oneself with god through the head. The only
possible bridge is through the heart. One can argue for years or for
lives, but one will not come to any conclusion about god. Logic is not
in that direction, that dimension. It is not logic but love that brings
you to a conclusion. In fact logic never brings one to any conclusion,
it goes around in circles. Love takes a quantum leap and immediately
arrives at a conclusion. It is not through a process, it is intuitive,
it is sudden.</p><p>God has disappeared from the world for the simple reason that love
has disappeared, and god cannot be brought back to the world unless we
start creating more and more vibrations for love, unless we change the
milieu that exists on earth today, the atmosphere, the neo-sphere. It is
very logical, scientific, but it is absolutely anti-god. Even those who
believe in god believe only through logic. And to believe in logic is
not to believe at all, it is worthless. Unless it is a love affair, a
mad, mad love affair, it means nothing.</p><p>I teach the madness that love brings and the sanity that love brings.
They are the same thing, two sides of the same coin. The world will
think you insane, and those who know, they will think you sane.</p><p>Prayer has to be something absolutely individual. It has to be
spontaneous, it has</p><p>not to be learned. A learned prayer is a false prayer. Then you are
repeating like a parrot. It is meaningless, senseless -- empty words.
But when a prayer arises in your heart, when it has something of you in
it then it has tremendous significance. Then it is not a tale told by an
idiot, full of fury and noise, signifying nothing. It has tremendous
meaning and music.</p><p>One has to learn to communicate with existence. Talk to the stars,
talk to the rivers, talk to the trees, talk to the rocks. And don't feel
embarrassed because this is how god has manifested himself. Everything
that is, is a manifestation of god. Start communication with the
manifest god and only then one day will you be able to communicate with
the unmanifest. Start with the visible and then you can take a quantum
leap into the invisible. Talk to the earth, to the grass.</p><p>It may not look religious at all in the beginning, but just saying
hullo to a tree has something beautiful in it, something spiritual,
something holy, because you recognize the spirit of the tree, you
recognize the presence of the tree, you don't ignore it. And if a person
can learn only one thing -- not to ignore god in all his manifestations
-- then ignorance disappears and wisdom arises, arises from your
innermost core.</p><p>The very idea of fighting and conquering is ugly. The part cannot win
against the whole. It is utterly stupid. The part can only win with the
whole, through the whole. The part can only win if it allows the whole
to win through it -- allowing god to function through you, letting his
will be your will, not having any separate will of one's own, not having
any separate goal, destiny of one's own, moving with the whole in total
accord, flowing with the whole wherever it leads.</p><p>In that let-go all fear, anxiety, anguish, disappears. and when there
is no fear there is love, and when there is no anguish there is joy. And
when you are no more separate there is no death.</p><p>Man never really dies. Nothing dies. The very idea that we are
separate creates, as a by-product, the phenomenon of death. In the first
place the idea of being separate is false and so is death, its
by-product.</p><p>Death is one of the most false things in existence, but it looks very
real if the ego is there; it is the shadow of the ego. Drop the ego --
and dropping the ego is the beginning, the beginning of a tremendously
significant pilgrimage. And in the very first step, you have arrived.
The first step is the last step. In dropping the</p><p>ego one becomes victorious. 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-4>Osho's books on

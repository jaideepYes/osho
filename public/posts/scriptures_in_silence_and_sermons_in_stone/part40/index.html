It is for reference purposes only.]\nMariko means the truth. That's our search, our inquiry, and that is the search of every being.\nWithout knowing the truth of life one remains unfulfilled, discontented, frustrated. The moment you know the truth all is fulfilled; suddenly everything fits together. You are no more the old miserable self, great bliss arises in you. The encounter with truth releases bliss in your being.\nAnd the only way to know truth is to be meditative: to be able to sit absolutely silently, without any thoughts, and yet remain conscious and not fall asleep. That's what meditation is: consciousness without thoughts. The moment the clouds of thoughts are gone and the mirror of consciousness is absolutely empty, truth is revealed, truth is reflected in you. And truth liberates.\nGerard means brave in the heart, and also a loyal heart.\nBoth are almost two sides of the same coin, because only the brave one can be the loyal one. The coward is always insincere. The coward lives out of fear, and fear can never allow one to be committed to anything. The coward remains driftwood, at the mercy of the winds; he has no sense of direction, no integrity.\nHe is just a hodgepodge. Only the brave person can be loyal, can be obedient, can be committed to a cause, can get totally involved in something, can risk his life.\nSannyas needs both qualities: a tremendous courage and a deep loyalty -- loyalty towards truth, loyalty 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- towards God.\nBliss is the ultimate flowering of consciousness. Ordinarily consciousness is only a seed, a potentiality.\nIt has to be made actual. That's the whole work of sannyas: to transform the potential into the actual. And man has tremendous potentiality. If you look into man's potential he is as big, as huge, as enormous as god himself. He is a seed of god.\nEls means god. If man blooms in his consciousness he is god, he is bliss. If man remains closed as a seed he is not even human, what to say about being god? -- he is just another kind of animal. And he is totally miserable, because the seed is closed. It does not even have windows to communicate with existence; it is encapsulated in itself. It is an egg, an ego.\nSannyas means dropping the ego, coming out of the egg, risking all. The egg means to be very protective. It seems as if it is your home. It is not. It has to be left behind, it has to be broken, only then will you have the whole sky to yourself, only then will you be able to use your wings.\nMan remains afraid of coming out of his securities. That's the only problem, I say the only problem for spiritual growth: the fear of coming out of the so-called security. It is only apparently so: it is not real security, it is death.\nReal security is in getting out of the egg and becoming part of the sky. Yes, from the point of view of the person who is still living in an enclosed world, it is\ninsecurity to be in the open sky. But those who have known the open sky -- the Buddhas -- say that insecurity is the only security, and to risk life is the only way to know it. To risk all is to know all.\nSannyas is a way of dangerous living, adventurous living; unconventional, untraditional. A sannyasin lives out of his own self, according to his own small light. And remember, even if you go astray according to your own small light, it is going to help you; even going astray will become growth. And in following and imitating others, even if you always remain in the right, you will remain immature, you will never grow.\n-- How long will you be here?\n-- I leave next week.\n-- Come back soon for a longer period.… And now think of this place as your home. Sooner or later you have to end up here. That is both a prediction and a promise!\nLet your love be as strong as possible. Put everything into it, don't hold back, don't be miserly about it.\nPeople are very miserly about love. They want it but they never give it -- and the law of love is that the more you give, the more you get, the more you desire without giving, the less will you get. Everybody wants and nobody gives, hence the whole of humanity lives in a state of starvation, spiritual starvation.\nLove is as much a nourishment to the soul as food is to the body. Love is the food for the soul.\nGive totally. Enjoy giving for no reason at all, for the sheer joy of sharing -- whether anything comes back in return or not should not be given any thought. Then love becomes stronger and stronger. And the more strong your love is, the more you have a soul in you. Love is the womb in which the soul grows.\nAmito means the immeasurable, the infinite, the eternal.\nThese are the qualities of god, these are the qualities of existence itself.\nBut man thinks himself finite, measurable. He thinks himself confined between\nbirth and death -- and that is a totally wrong attitude, wrong approach. One cannot know oneself if, from the very beginning, one believes a wrong conclusion.\nYou have always been here and you will always be here. Even before your birth you were here, and after your death you will be here. Neither is birth your beginning, nor is death your end. You are immeasurable, infinite, as infinite as existence itself, neither less nor more.\nTo remember it is to go beyond all fear, to recognise it is to recognise oneself as divine. And the moment you recognise yourself as divine you have recognised everybody else as divine also. The moment you understand your true nature you have understood the whole existence.\nAnanto means the infinite. Man appears very finite. He is not. But the appearance is very deceptive and we go on believing in the appearance. We never look deep enough to go beyond the appearance and to find the reality. The reality is totally different.\nIf you look at man from the outside he is just a dewdrop in this infinite universe, but if you look at man from within then he is as oceanic as one can be. Then the dewdrop is only a fallacy of the senses.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nReligion tries to look at man from the innermost core -- not as an object but as a subjectivity. That's why religion can declare that man is god. Psychology cannot declare that. Psychology is still struggling with the stupid idea of objectivity, that man has to be observed as an object. Then you will miss the real thing. As an object, man is only a body, at the most a brain. You can watch his behavior just as you watch the behavior of rats. And they are the same, as far as behavior is concerned there is not much difference. The difference is somewhere else, in the subjectivity.\nMeditation is the one-hundred-and-eighty-degree turn from objectivity to subjectivity. You stop looking at man from the outside. First you start looking at yourself from your innermost core; you stand there and you look at yourself from there, and you become as big as the universe. In that moment great freedom descends. That moment is the moment of nirvana, enlightenment.\nNisimo means unbounded, without any boundaries. That's our reality. All boundaries are illusory.\nOrdinarily we think that our boundary is our body. The sun is far away but if the sun dies we will die immediately. There are millions of miles distance, but the sun is somehow part of our body. Otherwise, why should we die? The sun may live, may die, it should be irrelevant to us. It is not. We continuously breathe air in and out. Not for a single moment are we in a state of non-communication with existence -- although we are not continuously aware of it.\nBuddha tried very much to emphasise breathing, for the simple reason that if you become aware of breathing you will become aware of your unboundedness. The breath that is in me was in you just a moment before. It was part of you, now it is part of me. And soon it will be part of somebody else. We absorb oxygen and release carbon dioxide; the trees absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen. Without trees we cannot exist, without us trees cannot exist. So we are related, joined. Even the smallest blade of grass is part of the greatest star, and the greatest star is part of the smallest blade of grass. Existence is one.\nTo understand this is to experience god. God is not somebody, god is not a person, but this experience of oneness, this experience of unboundedness.\nJesus says that god is love. It is a tremendously important statement. Nobody before him has said that.\nIn fact before him the Judaic god was a very angry god, a very jealous god. In the Old Testament he declares, I am a very jealous god. With jealousy love is impossible. And the very idea of god being jealous and angry is ugly. It has nothing to do with god because it is simply ungodly to be angry, to be jealous.\nJesus brings a great revelation to the world; god is love. But I want to change it a little bit, I want to refine it a little more. I don't say god is love, I say love is god. The difference may not appear immediately, but the difference is great and very significant.\nGod is love, that means that love is only a quality of god, there can be other qualities too. Love is only one of the qualities, along with other qualities, it is only one of the attributes. When I say, \"Love is god,\" I make it whole and sole. Then love itself is the totality of god. There is nothing else; no other quality is needed. One attribute is enough, more than enough, because it implies all that is beautiful, it implies all that is divine, it implies all the great values.\nThat is going to be your name, and you have to remember it continuously so that it does not remain only a name but really becomes your very being.\nThe sarod is a musical instrument, one of the most beautiful musical instruments.\nI conceive of man also as a musical instrument. One has to learn to play upon it. If you don't learn how to play upon it you will create only noise, and it will be a disturbance; rather than being a blessing it will become a curse. That's what goes on happening to millions of people: their life is nothing but a tale told by an idiot, full of fury and noise, signifying nothing. And the simple reason is that they don't know how to play upon their heart, upon their being.\nJust as one learns to play upon the piano, the sitar, the sarod, the veena, the violin, one has to learn to play upon one's own being.\nSannyas has to become the beginning of that great art of creating music out of your own being. That music is what the mystics have called ecstasy, samadhi. That music is what others have called god, nirvana.\nAnd it is there, fast asleep; it has to be provoked, it has to be called forth. One has to be an artist, a musician. One has to be creative, and one has to be an explorer of one's own inner being.\nReligion is not worship, it is art. It is not formality, it is not a social institution; it is a transformation of your being. It is creating harmony in your soul, it is alchemy.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nOmkar is the sound that is heard in one's own being when all other noise in the mind has stopped. When there are no thoughts floating in the mind, when there is nothing to disturb one, one starts hearing a deep humming sound in one's own being -- that is called omkar, the sound of om.\nIt is not that you make it; if you make it you will miss the real thing. You are not to make it, it is not a mantra to be chanted. You have to be utterly silent and receptive. You have to listen, you have to be just a listener -- just ears and ears and ears and nothing else. Then suddenly a great explosion happens inside. The mystics have called it the still, small voice within. The Zen people call it the sound of one hand clapping, and in India we have given it the name, omkar.\nIt comes closest to \"om\" -- and that's exactly the word which Mohammedans use as \"amin\", and Christians use as \"amen\". It is exactly the same but it can be interpreted in different ways: om, amin, amen.\nIt is exactly the same word that exists in omnipresent, omnipotent and omniscient.\nThat om in 'omniscience' simply means: one who has been the soundless sound. In 'omnipresent' it means one who has become part of that universal sound. And in 'omnipotent' it means one who has become so attuned with the inner harmony, with the inner music of om, that he now has available all the powers of the world. The whole universe is at his disposal, the kingdom of god is his.\nThe sound of om is called omkar. That is going to be your work upon yourself: become more and more silent so that one day you can be blessed, so that one day you can hear it.\nScriptures in Silence and Sermons in Stones Chapter #41\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2414","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/scriptures_in_silence_and_sermons_in_stone/part40/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/scriptures_in_silence_and_sermons_in_stone/>Scriptures In Silence And Sermons In Stone</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>12 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2414 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Scriptures_In_Silence_And_Sermons_In_Stone/part40.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part39>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

appearance. We never look deep enough to go beyond the appearance and to
find the reality. The reality is totally different.</p><p>If you look at man from the outside he is just a dewdrop in this
infinite universe, but if you look at man from within then he is as
oceanic as one can be. Then the dewdrop is only a fallacy of the
senses.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on

object but as a subjectivity. That's why religion can declare that man
is god. Psychology cannot declare that. Psychology is still struggling
with the stupid idea of objectivity, that man has to be observed as an
object. Then you will miss the real thing. As an object, man is only a
body, at the most a brain. You can watch his behavior just as you watch
the behavior of rats. And they are the same, as far as behavior is
concerned there is not much difference. The difference is somewhere
else, in the subjectivity.</p><p>Meditation is the one-hundred-and-eighty-degree turn from objectivity
to subjectivity. You stop looking at man from the outside. First you
start looking at yourself from your innermost core; you stand there and
you look at yourself from there, and you become as big as the universe.
In that moment great freedom descends. That moment is the moment of
<em>nirvana</em>, enlightenment.</p><p>Nisimo means unbounded, without any boundaries. That's our reality.
All boundaries are illusory.</p><p>Ordinarily we think that our boundary is our body. The sun is far
away but if the sun dies we will die immediately. There are millions of
miles distance, but the sun is somehow part of our body. Otherwise, why
should we die? The sun may live, may die, it should be irrelevant to us.
It is not. We continuously breathe air in and out. Not for a single
moment are we in a state of non-communication with existence -- although
we are not continuously aware of it.</p><p>Buddha tried very much to emphasise breathing, for the simple reason
that if you become aware of breathing you will become aware of your
unboundedness. The breath that is in me was in you just a moment before.
It was part of you, now it is part of me. And soon it will be part of
somebody else. We absorb oxygen and release carbon dioxide; the trees
absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen. Without trees we cannot exist,
without us trees cannot exist. So we are related, joined. Even the
smallest blade of grass is part of the greatest star, and the greatest
star is part of the smallest blade of grass. Existence is one.</p><p>To understand this is to experience god. God is not somebody, god is
not a person, but this experience of oneness, this experience of
unboundedness.</p><p>Jesus says that god is love. It is a tremendously important
statement. Nobody before him has said that.</p><p>In fact before him the Judaic god was a very angry god, a very
jealous god. In the Old Testament he declares, I am a very jealous god.
With jealousy love is impossible. And the very idea of god being jealous
and angry is ugly. It has nothing to do with god because it is simply
ungodly to be angry, to be jealous.</p><p>Jesus brings a great revelation to the world; god is love. But I want
to change it a little bit, I want to refine it a little more. I don't
say god is love, I say love is god. The difference may not appear
immediately, but the difference is great and very significant.</p><p>God is love, that means that love is only a quality of god, there can
be other qualities too. Love is only one of the qualities, along with
other qualities, it is only one of the attributes. When I say, "Love is
god," I make it whole and sole. Then love itself is the totality of god.
There is nothing else; no other quality is needed. One attribute is
enough, more than enough, because it implies all that is beautiful, it
implies all that is divine, it implies all the great values.</p><p>That is going to be your name, and you have to remember it
continuously so that it does not remain only a name but really becomes
your very being.</p><p>The sarod is a musical instrument, one of the most beautiful musical
instruments.</p><p>I conceive of man also as a musical instrument. One has to learn to
play upon it. If you don't learn how to play upon it you will create
only noise, and it will be a disturbance; rather than being a blessing
it will become a curse. That's what goes on happening to millions of
people: their life is nothing but a tale told by an idiot, full of fury
and noise, signifying nothing. And the simple reason is that they don't
know how to play upon their heart, upon their being.</p><p>Just as one learns to play upon the piano, the sitar, the sarod, the
veena, the violin, one has to learn to play upon one's own being.</p><p>Sannyas has to become the beginning of that great art of creating
music out of your own being. That music is what the mystics have called
ecstasy, <em>samadhi</em>. That music is what others have called god,
<em>nirvana</em>.</p><p>And it is there, fast asleep; it has to be provoked, it has to be
called forth. One has to be an artist, a musician. One has to be
creative, and one has to be an explorer of one's own inner being.</p><p>Religion is not worship, it is art. It is not formality, it is not a
social institution; it is a transformation of your being. It is creating
harmony in your soul, it is alchemy.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on

noise in the mind has stopped. When there are no thoughts floating in
the mind, when there is nothing to disturb one, one starts hearing a
deep humming sound in one's own being -- that is called omkar, the sound
of om.</p><p>It is not that you make it; if you make it you will miss the real
thing. You are not to make it, it is not a mantra to be chanted. You
have to be utterly silent and receptive. You have to listen, you have to
be just a listener -- just ears and ears and ears and nothing else. Then
suddenly a great explosion happens inside. The mystics have called it
the still, small voice within. The Zen people call it the sound of one
hand clapping, and in India we have given it the name, omkar.</p><p>It comes closest to "om" -- and that's exactly the word which
Mohammedans use as "amin", and Christians use as "amen". It is exactly
the same but it can be interpreted in different ways: om, amin,
amen.</p><p>It is exactly the same word that exists in omnipresent, omnipotent
and omniscient.</p><p>That om in 'omniscience' simply means: one who has been the soundless
sound. In 'omnipresent' it means one who has become part of that
universal sound. And in 'omnipotent' it means one who has become so
attuned with the inner harmony, with the inner music of om, that he now
has available all the powers of the world. The whole universe is at his
disposal, the kingdom of god is his.</p><p>The sound of om is called omkar. That is going to be your work upon
yourself: become more and more silent so that one day you can be
blessed, so that one day you can hear it.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=scriptures-in-silence-and-sermons-in-stones>Scriptures in Silence

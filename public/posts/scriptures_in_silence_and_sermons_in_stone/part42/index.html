It is for reference purposes only.]\nRemember one thing: god is the closest when you are blissful; when you are in misery you are farthest away from god. The dilemma is that people remember god only when they are in misery -- and that is the moment when they are farthest away. Even if they shout their voice cannot reach. When you are blissful you need not even whisper. Without saying a single word your prayer is understood. Even your silence is eloquent.\nBut this has been the problem down the ages: man remembers god only when he is miserable, which is the wrong moment to remember him. When you remember god in misery that means you want to use him --\nand god cannot be used as a means. That is sacrilege, that is sing the very idea of using g d as a means. Even to use another human being as a means is immoral, what to say about god if you think about him as a means to some other end? Hence man goes on praying and his prayers remain unfulfilled. He prays at the wrong moment.\nMy approach here is to make this clear to you: when you are in a blissful moment, when you are feeling blessed by existence, don't miss that moment; that is when you are closest to god. Let that moment be of gratitude, prayer,\nmeditation. In that moment remember god, not verbally -- existentially. Let your whole being feel the vibe, become overwhelmed with the beyond. Don't lose that moment, it is very precious.\nDon't become too engrossed in the beauty of the moment. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nIt is as if you are standing near a window with a beautiful golden frame and just outside the window there is a beautiful sunset. You can become too engrossed with the beautiful frame of the window and miss the moment. Of course the frame is beautiful, but a frame is a frame. And the window is useless if it prevents you... Its whole use consists of making the beyond available to you. Bliss is only a frame: it opens the beyond. Don't become too forgetful, don't be lost, don't be overwhelmed by the bliss.\nLet blissful moments become moments of prayer and god is not far away. And once known, he is known forever. Then there is no way to miss him, then he is everywhere. Then he is within and without.\nManfred means man of peace. And that's exactly the definition of a sannyasin: a man of peace; a man who has no quarrel of any kind with existence, who is not in any mood to fight with ANYbody, who has dropped fighting, who no more thinks of himself in terms of the ego, who feels one with the whole.\nOnly then do you know what peace is -- when all conflict between you and existence disappears, so much so that there is no distinction between you and the whole... because the distinction consists only of conflicts. The less you fight, the less you feel that you are separate. when the fight disappears completely there is no distinction, no definition; you and the whole are one.\nThat oneness is peace. And that is the greatest achievement in life: the fulfillment, the flowering, the fruition of life.\nMan is a seed and can become a great tree with thousands of flowers. Unless it happens one goes on feeling discontented. A tree feels blissful when it blooms. Exactly like that, when a man comes to flowering there is deep joy and contentment; one has arrived home. In the East we call that state Buddhahood, in the West the state is called Christ-consciousness. It is the same state.\nKeep it in your mind. Right now it is only a possibility, but it can be transformed into reality; and it has to be done. By becoming a sannyasin you are becoming committed to this goal. Now all your life energies should be directed towards this single point.\nParijat is a beautiful flower of the East.\nBecome a flower. The flower represents opening. The seed is closed, the flower is open. The seed is disconnected from existence because it is closed. The flower is bridged with existence -- with the sun rays dancing on it, with the wind passing by it, with the birds singing around it. It is radiating joy, it is radiating life, beauty, fragrance. It is sharing its being with the whole, it is offering its soul to the feet of god. And that's what a sannyasin has to be: a flower, not a seed.\nA sannyasin has to be totally open to existence, not closed like a bud, but utterly open, vulnerable, available. In that availability the ego disappears. And the disappearance of the ego is the beginning of the experience of g d.\nWhen you are not, god is. Let the ego die so that god can be born in you.\nEverybody is born ready for god. If we miss, it is totally our responsibility. We miss because we never look within. We miss because we never use the opportunity that life gives to us. We miss because we are lazy. We miss because we are unconscious, sleepy. We miss because we are not at all aware of the great blessing that life is.\nIn itself it is nothing, but it can become a stepping stone to god -- and that is its preciousness. Life is only a means, and is the end. If you become lost in the means you have lost the opportunity: you have become too interested in the staircase and you have forgotten that the staircase is just to be used. You have become too involved with the bridge and you have forgotten that you have to go to the other shore.\nSannyas is only a remembrance; an effort to remember what we are missing, an\neffort to remember why we are here, an effort to remember what this life is all about. Just a little effort is needed and the darkness starts dispersing and a small ray of light arises from your very centre and starts guiding you. That ray is from god. It is already there -- we just have to search for it a little bit, because we have gathered too much unnecessary furniture inside, and it is lost in that furniture.\nNishanto means the end of the night. Sannyas is nothing but a spiritual dawn, the beginning of the day.\nTo live unconsciously is to live in the night. The effort to live consciously is the beginning of the day.\nAnd when you succeed in living consciously you have succeeded in bringing such light to your being that it cannot be taken away from you.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nGod is light; hence god can only be found by becoming more and more aware. Awareness too is light.\nUnconsciousness is darkness, it is night.\nOrdinarily nine-tenths of our being is unconscious, only one-tenth is conscious. We are at the mercy of unconscious forces, that's why our life is a mess. We have to become more and more conscious. When one's whole being is full of light, one hundred percent, then only is one really born. Before that one was only in the womb.\nOrdinarily a person remains in the womb for his whole life, not only for nine months but for ninety years. To be really alive a second birth is needed -- and that's the whole effort of sannyas: to give you a second birth, to make you twice born.\nTo me virtue does not mean morality; virtue means awareness. The moral person\nis only formally virtuous, superficially virtuous. His virtue is not coming from his innermost being, it is something cultivated, painted. He is performing a social formality. Otherwise he is as immoral as any immoral person, or even more so.\nReal virtue cannot be cultivated; it is a by-product, a by-product of becoming more aware. When you are aware you cannot do wrong. In total awareness the wrong completely disappears, just as in light darkness disappears. That is true virtue, and that is the meaning of your name. Let it also become the meaning of your life.\nFrom this moment remember it as much as possible -- god loves you. There are a thousand and one proofs of his love. Once you start becoming aware, you will find all those proofs. He breathes life in you, he beats in your heart, he circulates in your blood. He is your body, your mind, your heart, your soul. He comes in so many blessings every moment -- it is just that we have not taken note of it. We have taken it for granted. That is the original sin. Once you take god and his blessings for granted you start becoming irreligious.\nDon't take anything for granted. It is a gift, we have not earned it. It is given by the whole just out of love, for no other reason. We are not worthy of it. Still god goes on pouring his love, his blessings; his flowers go on showering on us like rain.\nThey are invisible, and one needs a little more alertness to see them, but they can be seen. The day that you have seen them, from that day you are not blind any more.\nSumeru is the mythological mountain of paradise. Just as the Himalayas are here on the earth, Sumeru is in heaven. It is a metaphor, a myth. The whole mountain is made of solid gold and its peaks are the highest.\nThe sun is always showering its light on those peaks, they are always sunlit. Just visualise golden Himalayas with the sun always showering its light.\nThis Sumeru, the mythological Himalayas in heaven, represents the ultimate peaL of human consciousness. Man can reach to a point where consciousness becomes golden, is golden, and where light is continuously showering on you. That is the ultimate state of samadhi, the ultimate state of ecstasy. It has to be achieved, it is our birthright. We can achieve it, we just have to gather together\nall our forces and we have to become a one-pointed arrow.\nTruth or god is beyond knowledge. You cannot know truth through the scriptures, through education, through studying, through gathering information, because whatsoever you accumulate will be about god, but it will not be the experience of god himself.\nThey are totally different: to know about love is one thing and to know love is totally different. To know about light is one thing, and to know light is totally different. Even a blind man can know about light but he cannot know light. Our so-called pundits, scholars, knowledgeable people, are just blind people: people who know about god, who know about truth, but who know nothing in fact. All that they have is mere words.\nDon't be lost in the jungle of words. Remember continuously that the only way to know god or truth is through experience. Scriptures cannot help, nobody else can give you the experience; you have to attain it on your own.\nBuddha says: Be a light unto yourself. And that is basically what meditation is.\nBe a light unto yourself. Sit silently, more and more silently, and listen to your own being. Make the mind as quiet as possible, It takes time, it can't be done in a hurry. Patience is needed, tremendous patience 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nis needed, but one day it happens. One day that moment arrives when mind is absolutely silent, there is no noise inside, and for the first time you experience something that transforms you, that radically transforms you, that takes you beyond time into eternity, that takes you beyond death into life abundant.\nGuruprem means love for the master.\nThat is going to be your sadhana, your path. Nothing else is needed.\nSurrender totally -- with no conditions, with no strings attached to the surrender -\nbecause then it is no longer surrender. Be in a mad love.\nAll love is mad, but love for the master is the maddest! One cannot give any reason for it. It is irrational, absurd to the very core, and because of its absurdity it transforms. It takes you beyond the mind, beyond logic, beyond calculation. It takes you into the realm of the heart, and ultimately into the realm of being.\nThese are the three layers: mind, heart, being. Mind is logic, heart is love, being is beyond both. But to go to the being one has to pass through love. Love is the path which reaches the goal of being.\nSo in your name I have put your whole sadhana. It contains your whole future.\nTable of Contents Chapter title: None Chapter title: None Chapter title: None Chapter title: None Chapter title: None Chapter title: None Chapter title: None Chapter title: None Chapter title: None Chapter title: None Chapter title: None Chapter title: None Chapter title: None Chapter title: None Chapter title: None Chapter title: None Chapter title: None Chapter title: None Chapter title: None Chapter title: None Chapter title: None Chapter title: None Chapter title: None Chapter title: None Chapter title: None Chapter title: None Chapter title: None Chapter title: None Chapter title: None Chapter title: None Chapter title: None Chapter title: None Chapter title: None Chapter title: None Chapter title: None\n\u003c Previous | Contents\n","wordCount":"2316","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/scriptures_in_silence_and_sermons_in_stone/part42/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/scriptures_in_silence_and_sermons_in_stone/>Scriptures In Silence And Sermons In Stone</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>11 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2316 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Scriptures_In_Silence_And_Sermons_In_Stone/part42.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part41>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a></p><h2 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=chapter-title-none><span id=bookmark82>‌</span>Chapter title:

life is a mess. We have to become more and more conscious. When one's
whole being is full of light, one hundred percent, then only is one
really born. Before that one was only in the womb.</p><p>Ordinarily a person remains in the womb for his whole life, not only
for nine months but for ninety years. To be really alive a second birth
is needed -- and that's the whole effort of sannyas: to give you a
second birth, to make you twice born.</p><p>To me virtue does not mean morality; virtue means awareness. The
moral person</p><p>is only formally virtuous, superficially virtuous. His virtue is not
coming from his innermost being, it is something cultivated, painted. He
is performing a social formality. Otherwise he is as immoral as any
immoral person, or even more so.</p><p>Real virtue cannot be cultivated; it is a by-product, a by-product of
becoming more aware. When you are aware you cannot do wrong. In total
awareness the wrong completely disappears, just as in light darkness
disappears. That is true virtue, and that is the meaning of your name.
Let it also become the meaning of your life.</p><p>From this moment remember it as much as possible -- god loves you.
There are a thousand and one proofs of his love. Once you start becoming
aware, you will find all those proofs. He breathes life in you, he beats
in your heart, he circulates in your blood. He is your body, your mind,
your heart, your soul. He comes in so many blessings every moment -- it
is just that we have not taken note of it. We have taken it for granted.
That is the original sin. Once you take god and his blessings for
granted you start becoming irreligious.</p><p>Don't take anything for granted. It is a gift, we have not earned it.
It is given by the whole just out of love, for no other reason. We are
not worthy of it. Still god goes on pouring his love, his blessings; his
flowers go on showering on us like rain.</p><p>They are invisible, and one needs a little more alertness to see
them, but they can be seen. The day that you have seen them, from that
day you are not blind any more.</p><p>Sumeru is the mythological mountain of paradise. Just as the
Himalayas are here on the earth, Sumeru is in heaven. It is a metaphor,
a myth. The whole mountain is made of solid gold and its peaks are the
highest.</p><p>The sun is always showering its light on those peaks, they are always
sunlit. Just visualise golden Himalayas with the sun always showering
its light.</p><p>This Sumeru, the mythological Himalayas in heaven, represents the
ultimate peaL of human consciousness. Man can reach to a point where
consciousness becomes golden, is golden, and where light is continuously
showering on you. That is the ultimate state of <em>samadhi</em>, the
ultimate state of ecstasy. It has to be achieved, it is our birthright.
We <em>can</em> achieve it, we just have to gather together</p><p>all our forces and we have to become a one-pointed arrow.</p><p>Truth or god is beyond knowledge. You cannot know truth through the
scriptures, through education, through studying, through gathering
information, because whatsoever you accumulate will be <em>about</em>
god, but it will not be the experience of god himself.</p><p>They are totally different: to know about love is one thing and to
know love is totally different. To know about light is one thing, and to
<em>know</em> light is totally different. Even a blind man can know
about light but he cannot know light. Our so-called pundits, scholars,
knowledgeable people, are just blind people: people who know about god,
who know about truth, but who know nothing in fact. All that they have
is mere words.</p><p>Don't be lost in the jungle of words. Remember continuously that the
only way to know god or truth is through experience. Scriptures cannot
help, nobody else can give you the experience; you have to attain it on
your own.</p><p>Buddha says: Be a light unto yourself. And that is basically what
meditation is.</p><p>Be a light unto yourself. Sit silently, more and more silently, and
listen to your own being. Make the mind as quiet as possible, It takes
time, it can't be done in a hurry. Patience is needed, tremendous
patience 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on

mind is absolutely silent, there is no noise inside, and for the first
time you experience something that transforms you, that radically
transforms you, that takes you beyond time into eternity, that takes you
beyond death into life abundant.</p><p>Guruprem means love for the master.</p><p>That is going to be your sadhana, your path. Nothing else is
needed.</p><p>Surrender totally -- with no conditions, with no strings attached to
the surrender -</p><p>because then it is no longer surrender. Be in a mad love.</p><p>All love is mad, but love for the master is the maddest! One cannot
give any reason for it. It is irrational, absurd to the very core, and
because of its absurdity it transforms. It takes you beyond the mind,
beyond logic, beyond calculation. It takes you into the realm of the
heart, and ultimately into the realm of being.</p><p>These are the three layers: mind, heart, being. Mind is logic, heart
is love, being is beyond both. But to go to the being one has to pass
through love. Love is the path which reaches the goal of being.</p><p>So in your name I have put your whole sadhana. It contains your whole
future.</p><h1 style=padding-top:3pt;text-indent:0;text-align:center id=table-of-contents>Table of Contents</h1><p><u>Chapter title: None</u> <u>Chapter title: None</u> <u>Chapter

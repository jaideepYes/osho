And it needs more effort, more persistent work, than creating a kingdom outside. The work of Alexander the Great is nothing compared to the work of Jesus Christ, Buddha or Mohammed. Their work is really the pinnacle of human effort, human endeavour; human potential has come to its peak.\nThe real ruler rules himself, not others. The desire to rule others is just a poor substitute. It is to keep yourself occupied so that you remain forgetful about your inner chaos, so that you need not work upon yourself. It is an escape. The desire to rule over others is an escape.\nThe victory is through knowing the secret. And there is only one secret worth knowing -- that is your 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nown innermost self. That is the secretmost place. People go on traveling far and wide; that is not difficult.\nMan has reached the moon; it is so easy. But it is very difficult to reach one's own center. and the secret of the secret is hidden there, the master key which can unlock all the mysteries.\nBy being a sannyasin you are entering the path of self-discovery. It is already there, we have only to discover it. Just a few unnecessary things have to be removed, a few curtains, and suddenly we are face to face with God himself. The secret is that we are Gods, and the misery is that we have become beggars.\nLove contains my whole message. Love yourself -- that is the beginning, then love those who are close to you, then love the world, then love the whole cosmos; only then will you be able to love God.\nThe journey begins from one's own self and ends in God. These are the two banks of the river. You are on the bank, God is on the other, and love is the bridge. The bridge passes over the whole of the river, but people are very afraid of love; that's why they go on praying. They never understand what they are doing; their prayer is just ignorance. Unless it is full of love it can't be true. Their life misses love but they go on going to the churches and the temples. That is absolutely absurd.\nUnless you live in love you can't enter any temple of God; and one who lives in love need not enter a temple, he is already in it.\nRemember this simple message and try to live it, because this is not a doctrine to be believed in but a life to be evolved. Bloom in love, release the fragrance of love -- that is prayer. And only the fragrance of love reaches God, nothing else.\nMy sannyasin has to become a living message of bliss, not only in words but in deed. His very being has to radiate bliss. He has to be blissful and he has to create an atmosphere of bliss around himself wherever he is, so that whomsoever comes in contact with him immediately starts feeling the cool breeze of bliss.\nThe real message cannot be conveyed through words. Words can help -- they are secondary; the real message can be communicated only through being -- that is primary. Be cheerful, be blissful, be a song and a dance, and transform your whole life into a sacred celebration, into a sacred ceremony. This is what is\nmeant by being initiated into sannyas.\nThe moment one starts seeking and searching for oneself one becomes the blessed one. The enquiry itself is the beginning of the transformation. The more passionate the enquiry is, the sooner the transformation will come. Make it intense, make it total...\nSannyas has to be a deep commitment. Sannyas has to become more valuable than anything else in life, even more valuable than life itself.\nThis is one of the fundamental secrets of life and existence: you live only when you have something for which you are ready to sacrifice even your life. Life begins only when you have something more, higher, bigger, holier than life, in your life. When life itself becomes just a means to a higher end, then your life starts having a context. And in that context only is there meaning, significance, joy.\nZena comes from a Sanskrit root dhyana. It means meditation, not in the Western sense of the word, meditation with the Eastern approach.\nThe Western meditation is nothing but a kind of thinking: thinking of higher things is called meditation.\nWhen you think of God, when you think of Christ, when you think of Love, it is called meditation. In the East, thinking is not meditation at all -- whether you think of God or of money doesn't matter. Any thinking of any object is a disturbance in meditation. In the East, meditation means a state of no thought... just pure being. And that is the greatest experience in life, when you simply exist: no thought crosses your being, the whole traffic stops, the mind disappears. But consciousness is there and more than ever, because whatsoever was hidden behind the thoughts is no more hidden, whatsoever was involved in thoughts is no more involved. All energy is released. One is simply a pool of energy, and so silent that not even a ripple arises.\nIn that silent pool of consciousness, of energy, existence is reflected; we come to know that which is.\nAnd God is another name for that which is.\nThe full moon represents enlightenment, it represents perfection, it represents the\nultimate explosion of light. Exactly as the full moon rises in the sky, in deep meditation a full moon rises within your inner sky. It is not like the sun, because the sun is hot; it is like the moon, because the moon is cool.\nThe sun represents male energy, the moon reflects female energy. Science is a male approach towards 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nreality, religion is a female approach. Science is aggressive, religion is receptive; hence science has made the world more and more violent. We have violated nature, polluted the atmosphere, poisoned the oceans; in the name of science we have been really aggressive.\nReligion brings grace. Religion is love, science is war. Science thinks in term of conquest, religion thinks in terms of surrender. The moon represents all these things -- that's why I have chosen the moon to be on the flag of the new commune.\nPunitam means the sacred -- and that is one of the qualities that is missing, missing very much in the modern world, in modern consciousness.\nModern man is the first man in the whole history to have no idea of sacredness, to be living a very mundane life. He is interested in money, power, prestige, and he thinks that's all. It is such a stupid notion.\nHis life is surrounded by small things, very small. He has no idea of anything bigger than himself. He had denied God, he has said that God is dead. He has denied life after death, he has denied life within. He believes only in the superficial; he believes in the circumference but goes on denying the center; hence we see such boredom all around. It is natural, because without something bigger than you to relate to, your life is going to be tedious, boring. A life becomes a dance only when it is an adventure. And it can become an adventure only when there is something higher than you to achieve, to reach.\nThe sacred simply means that we are not the end, that we are only a passage, that\nall has not happened, that much has yet to happen. In fact the real has not happened yet. We are only seeds. The seed has to become a sprout, the sprout has to become a tree, the tree has to wait for the spring and the tree has to explode into thousands of flowers and release its soul into the cosmos. Only then will there be fulfillment.…\nand the sacred is not far away; we just have to start enquiring about it. In the beginning we are groping in the dark, of course, but soon things start falling in tune, soon we start having glimpses of the beyond, some unheard music starts reaching our hearts. It stirs our being, it starts giving us a new color, a new joy, a new life.\nMan has the potential of becoming a song of love, a dance of love, but very few people, very rare people, transform their potential into the actual. They are born as seeds, they die as seeds. Their life remains nothing but a long experiment in futility. And the older they grow, the more frustrated they become, naturally, because all their hopes are being shattered, all their desires are bringing nothing but tears, agony, anguish. As the time passes they become aware that whatsoever they have ben doing with their life has ben of no value. How can they sing? How can they dance? How can they feel grateful to God? It is impossible.\nMy observation is that people go to the temples and the synagogues and the churches only out of fear, not out of love. Yes, older people go more often because they have become more afraid of death. They don't go to the church or the temple because they have known something tremendously valuable in life, but because life is slipping out of their hands and the great darkness of death is coming closer and they are afraid; they want someone to protect them. Now they know that their money is not going to be with them, their friends are not going to be with them, their families will leave them. Out of desperation they start clinging to the idea of God. But this is not out of love and this is not out of gratitude. And a God born out of fear is a false God. A God born out of love is a true God.\nMy whole effort here is to make windows into God available so that you don't go to God out of fear, so that you can go through the experience of beauty, through the experience of creativity, through the experience of love. And when a person goes through these experiences the contact is tremendous, transforming. A single living contact with God is enough; you will never be the same again.\nScriptures in Silence and Sermons in Stones Chapter #28\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"1848","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/scriptures_in_silence_and_sermons_in_stone/part27/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/scriptures_in_silence_and_sermons_in_stone/>Scriptures In Silence And Sermons In Stone</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>9 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1848 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Scriptures_In_Silence_And_Sermons_In_Stone/part27.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part26>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

hands and the great darkness of death is coming closer and they are
afraid; they want someone to protect them. Now they know that their
money is not going to be with them, their friends are not going to be
with them, their families will leave them. Out of desperation they start
clinging to the idea of God. But this is not out of love and this is not
out of gratitude. And a God born out of fear is a false God. A God born
out of love is a true God.</p><p>My whole effort here is to make windows into God available so that
you don't go to God out of fear, so that you can go through the
experience of beauty, through the experience of creativity, through the
experience of love. And when a person goes through these experiences the
contact is tremendous, transforming. A single living contact with God is
enough; you will never be the same again.</p><h3 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=scriptures-in-silence-and-sermons-in-stones>Scriptures in Silence

It is for reference purposes only.]\n(to Victoria)\nOne can know God not by conquering but by surrendering. You have to go beyond the idea of victory, conquest. Those are all ego trips. Blessed are those who have no idea of any conquest, who have no ambitions to be somebody special, who are humble. Jesus says: Blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of God. I say the same unto you.\nDrop the ambitious mind. Mind is always ambitious. When you drop the ambitious mind, mind itself is dropped because ambition is mind, desire is mind, dreaming is mind. Desiring gone, dreaming gone, ambitions dropped, mind dies of its own accord; and in that state of no-mind God arrives. God is always ready to come in, we just have to open the door. No-mind is the door open; mind means the door closed.\n(to Ignacio)\nLove is the fire that can make you aflame. Without love a man is an unlit lamp capable of great light, but the light is not yet actual; it is dormant, fast asleep. Love comes and spring comes. And as love enters your being it is fire: it\nenkindles you, and the whole of life becomes light.\nAll the religions of the world have defined God as light because it is an experience of becoming totally aflame. And anything that makes you more fiery is helpful; anything that makes you more passionate, more intense, more total is a bridge.\nPeople live very dull lives. They live as if they are sleepwalkers. They live unconsciously as if they themselves don't live, but their biological instincts go on goading them to live in a certain way.\nThe ordinary man is a robot, he is a machine; man has not yet been born. The machine becomes man only with the entry of love in to your life. The machine can do all that your brain can do. So the old definition of man as a rational being is no more relevant because a computer is far more rational than you are. We will have to change the definition of man. That's what we are doing here, that's what sannyas is all about; a redefining of man.\nMan is not a rational animal. Machines cannot love; no computer is capable of feeling. Hence in the future thinking is not going to be the defining factor, but feeling. One day the computer may substitute the scientist, the mathematician, the physicist, but the computer cannot substitute the lover, the poet.\nLove is the door from where we enter into a higher plane of being. It is through love that all creativity is 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nborn. It is through love that man starts feeling significant, attains to glory, becomes meaningful. Love is the only ultimate law.\nThe color orange is the color of love, because in the East it is the color of spring. Spring is the season of love. Up to now you have been Ignacio in name only, but my effort will be to make it a reality. Help me!\nHow long will you be here?\nI'm leaving tomorrow.\nAnd when will you be back?\nAs soon as possible. Perhaps in ten days, thirty days, forty days! Good -- come back as soon as possible. Now this is your home! (to Jan)\nEverything is a gift of God. We don't deserve anything, we are not worthy of anything. God gives us life, the capacity to love, the capacity to feel beauty, the capacity to find truth -- not because we are worthy, not because we deserve them, but because he has too much. He is like a cloud full of rain: he has to shower.\nIt is out of his abundance that we receive. He is like a flower that has inxehaustible perfume; it is bound to be released to the winds. He is like a light -\n- beginningless, endless. It has to be shared otherwise it becomes a burden.\nThe ancient stories of all the nations say that God was alone; he felt his loneliness and created the world.\nIf I were to write those stories again I would say that God was not simply alone; he was so full of joy, so abundantly rich, that he needed somebody to share it. He needed a whole universe to share it with.\nThe old stories have something wrong with them. God was alone, he felt the loneliness -- it has a tinge of sadness in it. He was not happy being alone with himself so he created the world as he wanted a certain occupation, as if the other was needed to become occupied, engaged, involved in ... so he could forget his own loneliness. These stories must have been created by people who have suffered from loneliness. And who has not suffered? Almost everybody suffers from loneliness. And out of loneliness we hanker for the other.\nThese stories are not written by Buddha -- that much is certain. About that I can be absolutely authoritative: these stories are written by ordinary people who are suffering from loneliness. They project their loneliness onto God. They cannot be happy when they are alone, they think \"How can God be happy when he is alone?\" It is just a human projection, anthropocentric. They think of God in the\nsame way as they think about themselves: they need the other, they need company. The man needs the woman, the woman needs the man: the other is a must otherwise one starts drowing in one's own loneliness.\nThese stories must have been written by people who don't know what it is to be god, what it is to be aware, what it is to be awakened. If Buddha wrote the stories they would have a totally different flavor.\nThat's why I am saying that if I were to write I would write that god was so happy, so joyous, so cheerful, with so much laughter, that he wanted somebody to share it. Not that he needed the other, he was enough unto himself, but it was too much. It was unbearable bliss, hence he created the world. Everything is a gift out of his abundance. To feel it is to be grateful, to feel it is to be prayerful.\nLet this be your work upon yourself: feel more and more grateful. Gratitude is the essence of prayer, and gratitude is possible only when you see that all is a gift, each breath is a gift. And what a gift! -- so valuable that there is no way to purchase it. It has no price. You can't purchase life; you can't purchase love; you can't purchase aesthetic sensibility; you can't purchase creativity; you can't purchase intelligence -- but they are all given. Even before you ask for them you have been provided for. Just a little search within oneself and one comes upon treasures and treasures.\nYes, Jesus is right: the kingdom of God is within you. (to Veetasmi)\nEgo consists of feeling, of thinking that we are separate from existence, that we are like islands. It is absolutely false. We don't exist in separation, we can't exist even for a single moment in separation. The 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nbreath that comes in keeps us joined with the outside. And we are not only breathing with the nose, we are breathing from every pore of the body. We are thirsty: we drink water and the water quenches the thirst; it is continuously\nmoving from the outer towards the inner and from the inner towards the outer. Food is continuously in circulation, breathing is in circulation. We are in constant exchange with reality. We are not separate, we are bridged in a thousand and one ways.\nTo understand it is to go beyond the ego. Then one never thinks \"I am separate,\" but \"I am one with the whole.\" And that's what true religiousness is: this feeling of great union with existence, of oneness.\nThen anxiety disappears automatically; then sadness disappears automatically. These are the by-products of the ego. The ego makes you frustrated because first it makes you expect things and then they don't happen. They can't happen because in the beginning the ego is false, all its expectations are false --\nthey cannot be fulfilled. Hence frustration settles in, one becomes sad. One suffers great despair.\nThe ego is constantly afraid of death because ... it is a false entity. You are somehow holding onto it. It can disappear any moment; it is very fragile. Hence the fear of death and with the fear the anxiety, the anguish.\nOnce the ego is not there, there is no expectation, frustration, no desire, no despair. Suddenly one finds oneself falling into a deep harmony with the cosmos. And that harmony is God; that harmony is nirvana; that harmony is tao.\nGod is not a theological concept but a deep experience of communion with existence. Meditation prepares the way because it helps you to dismantle the false ego. Love helps because love also makes you aware of the falsity of the ego. Love gives you a few glimpses of egolessness; meditation gives you a solid ground on which to stand without the ego.\nAnd between love and meditation sannyas grows. Between these two challenges sannyas happens. On one side it is love; on the other side it is meditation. And exactly in the middle of love and meditation is sannyas.\n(Deva Pradipam: divine light)\nMan is made of light; the whole universe is made of light. Mystics have been experiencing it for centuries. Then ancientmost records which are at least six or seven thousand years old state the same phenomenon as the modern mystic does:\nthat existence is nothing but an expression of light energy, that the universe is made of the stuff called light. But mystics have never been listened to; nobody takes much note of them. They are thought to be mad peole or at the most poets, dreamers, visionaries. But now modern science says the same thing -- that existence consists of the basic element of light, electricity.\nWhen science says it people immediately start believing it, because then it is coming from people who are thought to be sane, logical, calculative, more dependable. But one thing should be thought about now: that six, seven thousand years of continuous teaching of the saints, of the mystics, was not insane; it was based in reality. It was one of the most fundamental truths. Science is lagging far behind, seven thousand years behind. There are many more things that mystics have been saying and with which science has not yet agreed. Science will have to agree but it may take another seven thousand years.\nScience grows very slowly, at a snail's pace, because it is very cautious. Each step has to be taken so calculatively that for years the scientist waits to take a single step, to move even a single inch. In that way mystics are mad: they trust existence so much that they drop all cautiousness. Their trust is so infinite that they rush into any unknown direction, hence they are the first discoverers, the most adventurous people.\nThat's what I want my sannyasins to be: mystics -- adventurous, courageous, always ready to go into the uncharted, always ready to forget the past, to leave this shore for the unknown shore which is not visible at all. Maybe it is , maybe it is not ... but in that very risking one grows. Whether the other shore is or is not, is not the point at all. If one risks so much, if one has that much courage, such guts, that brings one a new life.\nIt brings a soul into your body; otherwise people are just bodies without souls. It creates an integrity, an integration. It crystallizes your consciousness -- and that is the other shore; it is not that the other shore is somewhere else. The crystallized consciousness is the other shore. Then even in the middle of the ocean you are on the other shore because then there is no death for you.\nDeath is only for cowards. For the courageous there is no death; there never has been, there never will be.\n(Japanese artist, Meera, is back. She runs a meditation center and an art gallery\nand it seems she sent in 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nsome samples of her work to Osho. Hello, Meera! When did you arrive? Five days ago.\nVery good! I looked into your paintings and pictures -- really beautiful! You have done a good job.\nNow you also have to create a group of painters here -- just like the theatre group.\nGood, Meera. Now start working on it.

separation. The 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on

only breathing with the nose, we are breathing from every pore of the
body. We are thirsty: we drink water and the water quenches the thirst;
it is continuously</p><p>moving from the outer towards the inner and from the inner towards
the outer. Food is continuously in circulation, breathing is in
circulation. We are in constant exchange with reality. We are not
separate, we are bridged in a thousand and one ways.</p><p>To understand it is to go beyond the ego. Then one never thinks "I am
separate," but "I am one with the whole." And that's what true
religiousness is: this feeling of great union with existence, of
oneness.</p><p>Then anxiety disappears automatically; then sadness disappears
automatically. These are the by-products of the ego. The ego makes you
frustrated because first it makes you expect things and then they don't
happen. They can't happen because in the beginning the ego is false, all
its expectations are false --</p><p>they cannot be fulfilled. Hence frustration settles in, one becomes
sad. One suffers great despair.</p><p>The ego is constantly afraid of death because ... it is a false
entity. You are somehow holding onto it. It can disappear any moment; it
is very fragile. Hence the fear of death and with the fear the anxiety,
the anguish.</p><p>Once the ego is not there, there is no expectation, frustration, no
desire, no despair. Suddenly one finds oneself falling into a deep
harmony with the cosmos. And that harmony is God; that harmony is
<em>nirvana</em>; that harmony is tao.</p><p>God is not a theological concept but a deep experience of communion
with existence. Meditation prepares the way because it helps you to
dismantle the false ego. Love helps because love also makes you aware of
the falsity of the ego. Love gives you a few glimpses of egolessness;
meditation gives you a solid ground on which to stand without the
ego.</p><p>And between love and meditation sannyas grows. Between these two
challenges sannyas happens. On one side it is love; on the other side it
is meditation. And <em>exactly</em> in the middle of love and meditation
is sannyas.</p><p>(Deva Pradipam: divine light)</p><p>Man is made of light; the whole universe is made of light. Mystics
have been experiencing it for centuries. Then ancientmost records which
are at least six or seven thousand years old state the same phenomenon
as the modern mystic does:</p><p>that existence is nothing but an expression of light energy, that the
universe is made of the stuff called light. But mystics have never been
listened to; nobody takes much note of them. They are thought to be mad
peole or at the most poets, dreamers, visionaries. But now modern
science says the same thing -- that existence consists of the basic
element of light, electricity.</p><p>When science says it people immediately start believing it, because
then it is coming from people who are thought to be sane, logical,
calculative, more dependable. But one thing should be thought about now:
that six, seven thousand years of continuous teaching of the saints, of
the mystics, was not insane; it was based in reality. It was one of the
most fundamental truths. Science is lagging far behind, seven thousand
years behind. There are many more things that mystics have been saying
and with which science has not yet agreed. Science will have to agree
but it may take another seven thousand years.</p><p>Science grows very slowly, at a snail's pace, because it is very
cautious. Each step has to be taken so calculatively that for years the
scientist waits to take a single step, to move even a single inch. In
that way mystics <em>are</em> mad: they trust existence so much that
they drop all cautiousness. Their trust is so infinite that they rush
into any unknown direction, hence they are the first discoverers, the
most adventurous people.</p><p>That's what I want my sannyasins to be: mystics -- adventurous,
courageous, always ready to go into the uncharted, always ready to
forget the past, to leave this shore for the unknown shore which is not
visible at all. Maybe it is , maybe it is not ... but in that very
risking one grows. Whether the other shore is or is not, is not the
point at all. If one risks so much, if one has that much courage, such
guts, <em>that</em> brings one a new life.</p><p>It brings a soul into your body; otherwise people are just bodies
without souls. It creates an integrity, an integration. It crystallizes
your consciousness -- and <em>that</em> is the other shore; it is not
that the other shore is somewhere else. The crystallized consciousness
is the other shore. Then even in the middle of the ocean you are on the
other shore because then there is no death for you.</p><p>Death is only for cowards. For the courageous there is no death;
there never has been, there never will be.</p><p>(Japanese artist, Meera, is back. She runs a meditation center and an

This should be the basic function of the mother, the father, the parents. Normally we do just the contrary: we help the child to become more ambitious, more egoistic. Our whole effort is to project our desires through the child. Our dreams are unfulfilled -- dreams are never going to be fulfilled -- so we project them through the children, we hope that what has not happened to us will happen to them. The same has been the case with your parents and the same will be the case with your children when they become parents. For centuries, from one generation to another generation, wh have gone on giving hopes, ambitions, desires which are basically unfulfillable.\nTo be really helpful to the child we have to understand this. Have no more projections; don't load the child with your dreams. Help him to see the futility of all dreams. Then each child can become a buddha --\neach child is meant to become a buddha. It is because of wrong conditioning, wrong society, wrong education, that we hinder the growth.\nIn Japan they have a certain art ... it should not be called art -- it is butchery -- but they call it art. They grow trees in small pots. Big trees which if grown in the soil would reach to the clouds are grown in small pots which have no bottoms, and they go on cutting their roots. so there are trees in Japan, four-hundred-year- old trees, just six inches high. If you cut the roots how can the grow? They think that this is an art and it is appreciated by foolish people all over the world. People go to see those trees and they think something great has been done! They are centuries old and the gardeners have been keeping them generation after generation. The older the tree, if it is not alowed to grow, the more artful it is understood to be. It is ugly to see those trees.\nBut that is the situation of every child in the world; those trees are very representative. What do we do to children? -- we cut their roots ... unknowingly, of course. We want to help but we are so unconscious that our help is a hindrance, not a help.\nSo this is going to be your work. This will help you to wake up and this will help the child to grow in the right direction.\n(To Hugo)\nThe time has now come to go beyond mind. Mind is our bondage. Mind means the past, and to go beyond the mind means to live in the present. Slip out of the past, don't allow ot to interfere anymore, because to love through the past is to live a dead life. The past is dead. Living through it is living in a grave.\nThat's why there is so much misery in the world and so much deadness, insensivity, unconsciousness: people are not really alive. They are not flowering; there seems to be no growth happening. They are simply born, and vegetate and one day die. Their whole life consists of very meaningless actovities, trivia. They don't attain any significance. They can't say in the end that life has been a great benediction. They go frustrated, disappointed, disillusioned -- but nobody is responsible for it except themselves. If we live through the mind is going to\nhappen.\nNow we start living the life of meditation -- and meditation means the life of no- mind. Don't allow thoughts to interfere. Be in direct contact with existence: with trees, with rocks, rivers, people. Become a 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nchild again; then the circle is complete. One is born as a child, one should die as a child. Jesus sys: Unless you are like small children you will not enter into my kingdom of God ... And he is absolutely right. The really ripe and mature person is one who in his old age again becomes as innocent as a child. The circle is complete: life has come to its ultimate peak and we are ready to go back home.\nIf the circle is incomplete you will have to be born again, because the circle has to be completed; that is the task that has been given to us. Unless we fulfil it we cannot be called back by God. This is our work in life: to become a child again -- innocent, full of wonder an awe.\nMind is good as a mechanism; use it but don't be used by it. Don't become a servant of it, don't be possessed by it. Remain the master.\nAnd that's what sannyas is all about; becoming the master of your own mind so that when you want to put it aside you can put it aside, when you want to turn it off you can turn it off.\n(to Marko)\nIn India we have one of the greatest scriptures, the BHAGAVAD GITA. It is the story of a great warrior, Arjuna, trying to escape from the war-field. His master, who was functioning as a charioteer for Arjuna in the war, persuades him to stay in the war; there is no need to renounce it. The basic argument that the Master gives, that Krishna gives to Arjuna, is that if you fight for your own self then the war is ugly, but ifyou allow God to fight through you then you need not be worried; then you are simply a vehicle, a medium. Then if God decides to escape from the war it is perfectly okay; of he decides to be in the war that's perfectly\nokay.\nLife becomes a blissfulness whenever you allow God to flow through you, whenever you are just an instrument in his hands, when you don't have any will of your own. That is real war: not to have one's own will, not to have one's own ego. And that is real victory: to drop it, to get rid of it, and to be utterly in the hands of god.\n(to Nick)\nLove is the fragrance of the victorious heart. Ordinarily the head is victorious over the heart, hence man becomes incapable of love. Love cannot arises out of the head. Out of the head logic is possible, mathematics is possible, science is possible, business is possible, politics is possible -- but not love, not poetry, not music, not dance. They are the qualities of the heart, they are the petals of the flower of the heart. And man can live either trough the head or through the heart.\nThe whole transformation consists of moving from the head to the heart. Becomes less calculative, less clinging to the logical pattern, less businesslike. Be more of a lover. Learn to risk, learn to live dangerously\n-- only then there is dance and there is music and there is poetry. Lose the head to gain the heart, and you will be a sannyasin.\n(to Pratibha)\nIntellect and intelligence are two totally different things. Intellect is part of the head; intelligence is part of the heart. One can be a great intellectual and yet unintelligent, and one can be very intelligent and may not be an intellectual at all. A man can be a great scholar, a great pundit, with no intelligence. He is just like a parrot: he can quote scriptures but he functions like a machine. He does not understand what he is saying because he has not experienced it himself; it is all borrowed. And anything borrowed burdens you, chains you, imprison you. Only your own experience is liberating.\nMove towards the heart. Let love-intelligence arise in you. It can't come through scriptures, books, libraries, universities, academic degrees. It can only come through being more and more meditative, still, silent. It is not an extrovert effort but an introvert search. And when love-intelligence blooms life is fulfilled; there is great contentment. In that contentment one feels gratitude to God, and that\ngratitude is prayer. Before that all prayers are false. (Ma Prem Vishran: love and relaxation)\nThese are the two things you have to enter into: love and relaxation. They are helpful to each other, 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nsupportive of each other: if you are loving you become relaxed, if you are relaxed you become loving. And this goes on and on: you love more, you can relax more; you relax more, you love more. It becomes like a pyramid, you start going towards some unknown peak where love and relaxation become one. Then the goal is achieved. When your very being is relaxed and knows no tensions, then your whole being is just radiating love -- not to any particualr person but to the whole existence ... Even if you are sitting alone in a room you go on radiating love, the room becomes full of the vibe of your love. People who have eyes to see and hearts to feel, if they come into the room they will simply fell a different vibe in the room.\nSometimes even unconscious and blind people have glimpses of that. If in a certain house there has been a murder and you go in, you know nothing about the murder but suddenly you feel a tension growing in you for no reason at all. The whole air seems to be somehow heavy, dark, evil. If in some place people have been fighting, have been angry, shouting at each other -- they may have gone, but when you enter the room it is still echoing, resounding, with the anger, rage, hatred. You will feel it, as if the room were not empty.\nSo is the case if a loving person has been sitting there in the room alone, if a meditative person has been sitting in the room alone. You enter the room, suddenly you are showered with a totally new kind of energy\n-- nourishing. A joy arises in you. You may have been sad but suddenly entering into the room you feel great joy.\nThat's how temples were created in the beginning, but soon they became\ninstruments for cunning people to exploit the innocent. Otherwise the motive was beautiful, there must be a place where nobody fights, nobody becomes angry, where everybody goes with a worshipful heart, love, gratitude, prayer. Slowly slowly the temple accumulates all these vibrations, it becomes richer and richer. Hence the idea that the more ancient the temple is, the more significant it is, because it contains so many people and their beautiful vibes. That was the motive. It didn't come true: priests jumped in and destroyed all the temples.\nSo remember these two things: be loving and be relaxed. These two commandments are for being a sannyasin.\n(Joost becomes Swami Anand Svarup)\nBliss is not something external to you, it is something intrinsic to your very being, it is something that you are made of. So it is not a question of achieving it, it is only a question of recognizing it, remembering it. It is as if we had forgotten sothing. It is just on the tip of the tongue, you say, and yet you can't remember it. It is a very weird feeling when it happens -- when you know that you know, when you know that it is just on the tip of your tongue and still can't remember it. You remember this much -- that you know. It is so clearly, so loudly there, that one feels simply mystified by the phenomenon -- why is it not coming up?\nYou try this way and that and the more you try, the more difficult it seems. Out of sheer tiredeness you drop the whole subject, you forget all about it. Then some time just listening to music or walking in the garden or just taking a shower suddenly it comes up. Then it is more mystifying: why has it suddenly come and when you were trying why was it not coming? In fact when you were trying you became too tense, and whenever you are too tense you shut up within yourself, everything closes; and when you are relaxed everything opens up. Because you were too tense and you wanted it to happen, you really wanted to force it to come up, it simply slipped into the unconscious. but when you were not thinking about it at all, not desiring, not longing for it -- you had completely forgotten the whole matter -- suddenly it popped up in the head. That's how bliss is: we have simply forgotten; only a little relaxation is needed to remember it.\nAll meditation techniques are nothing but techniques for relaxation, for rest. Learn more relaxation, more rest. The more relaxed you become, the closer you are to God. When you are totally relaxed your whole being simply becomes flooded with light, flooded with love, flooded with bliss. Those are the proofs of\nGod and those are the only proofs of God. (Anand Amito: infinite bliss)\nBliss has no beginning, no end. It is always there. It is within and it is without, but we are blind to it. It is just like a blind man sitting in the sun: all is light but he can't see a thing, he can't see the light. The light is showering on him, he can even feel the warmth, but he cannot see the source of it. And that is the situation of all human beings: in rare moments we can feel a certain warmth of bliss, a certain wave, but it remains vague. It looks like a faraway echo of something, but we cannot put our hands on it. We call it happiness. Happiness is the blind man's experience of light; the blind's man experience of bliss, that is 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- happiness.\nMeditation is the way to cure your eyes, to help you to open your eyes. Maybe they don't need any treatment, you have just forgotten how to open them. Maybe for centuries and lives you have kept them closed. Or maybe you are going to see; it is better to remain in your closed world, it is cozy. Otherwise the vast infinite world will be encountered; it will be challenging, and one shrinks from facing the infinite. But without facing the infinite we will never know what bliss is, and our hearts long for it!\nSo no happiness satisfies, in fact it leaves a bitter taste in your mouth. It gives you a glimpse and then it disappears. It disappears, it frustrates. The heart can only be satisfied with bliss -- nothing less can make it feel contended.\nAnd bliss is already there. The whole existence is an ocean of bliss. We are swimming in it, living in it, but we are never seen it. I would like to see it! Because the fish is born in the ocean, lives in the ocean, the ocean is so close that there is no gap, no distance to perceive it.\nThat's the situation with us too: we are living in an infinite, invisible ocean of bliss. Just a little perceptiveness, a little sensitivity, a little more awareness, and\nyou will start seeing the invisible and you will start hearing the silent and you will be able to touch and feel the texture of the intangible.\n(Satyam John: truth, God's gracious gift)\nTruth is not a conclusion or our own efforts, of our own thinking. We cannot come to truth by logical reasoning. Through logical reasoning we can only arrive at a certain hypothesis. An hypothesis is only tentatively true, aproximately true, but never the truth. That is not the way to come to the truth, because thruth is beyond human comprehension, beyond our grasp. It can come only as a gift from God. We have to be open to receive it. It is not an effort but an effortless surrender: a totally open heart, ready to receive --\njust like a woman's womb, ready to receive. And then the child grows.\nThe real seeker has to become just like a womb ready to receive the seed from God. It comes, the moment you open it comes. It inevitably comes and then it grows inside you.\nOnce the seed has reached your heart it starts growing. Soon there will be great greenery in your heart and roses will start opening. But truth, the seed of truth, comes from God himself. We cannot arrive at it through any effort of our own. It is not an achievment, it is a gift.\nIt is very difficult to be ready to receive the gift because it goes against the ego. Ego wants to achieve, ego wants to conquer; hence ego can only achieve that which is not true, it can achieve only fictitious phenomena. The ego can become the president of a country -- which is a fiction. We are playing a great drama; the whole earth functions as the stage. One can become the prime minister of a country, but that is a fiction. It is supported by everybody else, hence it looks true, but it is not true. Ego can achieve only fictions.\nTo achieve the truth, that which is, we have to be ready, courageous enough to put the ego aside, to be egoless, to be humble. And truth comes inevitably -- just our readiness is missing. Truth goes on knocking on our hearts but not even a window is open; all is closed.\nMy work here consists of opening a few windows in your heart so that the sun and the wind and the rain can come in. With the sun and with the wind and with the rain comes God, and his seed which becomes truth one day blooms in you,\nand you are a Buddha or a Christ.\nThose who say they don't believe in God, they also belong to God. Those who turn their back towards God, they also belong to God; and as far as God is concerned they are all saved. This whole universe is already in the ultimate state: we have just forgotten. We have forgotten that we need not do anything; we have forgotten that we are already there, where we would like to be. We have forgotten that we are already that which we want to be, which we dream about and desire; and we have never been otherwise But a deep deep sleep has fallen\nover us.\nThe function of the Master is not to save you but just to remind you. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nScriptures in Silence and Sermons in Stones Chapter #6\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"3236","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/scriptures_in_silence_and_sermons_in_stone/part5/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/scriptures_in_silence_and_sermons_in_stone/>Scriptures In Silence And Sermons In Stone</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>16 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;3236 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Scriptures_In_Silence_And_Sermons_In_Stone/part5.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part4>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

is an art and it is appreciated by foolish people all over the world.
People go to see those trees and they think something great has been
done! They are centuries old and the gardeners have been keeping them
generation after generation. The older the tree, if it is not alowed to
grow, the more artful it is understood to be. It is ugly to see those
trees.</p><p>But that is the situation of every child in the world; those trees
are very representative. What do we do to children? -- we cut their
roots ... unknowingly, of course. We want to help but we are so
unconscious that our help is a hindrance, not a help.</p><p>So this is going to be your work. This will help <em>you</em> to wake
up and this will help the child to grow in the right direction.</p><p>(To Hugo)</p><p>The time has now come to go beyond mind. Mind is our bondage. Mind
means the past, and to go beyond the mind means to live in the present.
Slip out of the past, don't allow ot to interfere anymore, because to
love through the past is to live a dead life. The past is dead. Living
through it is living in a grave.</p><p>That's why there is so much misery in the world and so much deadness,
insensivity, unconsciousness: people are not really alive. They are not
flowering; there seems to be no growth happening. They are simply born,
and vegetate and one day die. Their whole life consists of very
meaningless actovities, trivia. They don't attain any significance. They
can't say in the end that life has been a great benediction. They go
frustrated, disappointed, disillusioned -- but nobody is responsible for
it except themselves. If we live through the mind is going to</p><p>happen.</p><p>Now we start living the life of meditation -- and meditation means
the life of no- mind. Don't allow thoughts to interfere. Be in

people. Become a 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on

should die as a child. Jesus sys: Unless you are like small children you
will not enter into <em>my</em> kingdom of God ... And he is absolutely
right. The really ripe and mature person is one who in his old age again
becomes as innocent as a child. The circle is complete: life has come to
its ultimate peak and we are ready to go back home.</p><p>If the circle is incomplete you will have to be born again, because
the circle <em>has</em> to be completed; that is the task that has been
given to us. Unless we fulfil it we cannot be called back by God. This
is our work in life: to become a child again -- innocent, full of wonder
an awe.</p><p>Mind is good as a mechanism; use it but don't be used by it. Don't
become a servant of it, don't be possessed by it. Remain the master.</p><p>And that's what sannyas is all about; becoming the master of your own
mind so that when you want to put it aside you can put it aside, when
you want to turn it off you can turn it off.</p><p>(to Marko)</p><p>In India we have one of the greatest scriptures, the BHAGAVAD GITA.
It is the story of a great warrior, Arjuna, trying to escape from the
war-field. His master, who was functioning as a charioteer for Arjuna in
the war, persuades him to stay in the war; there is no need to renounce
it. The basic argument that the Master gives, that Krishna gives to
Arjuna, is that if you fight for your own self then the war is ugly, but
ifyou allow God to fight through you then you need not be worried; then
you are simply a vehicle, a medium. Then if God decides to escape from
the war it is perfectly okay; of he decides to be in the war that's
perfectly</p><p>okay.</p><p>Life becomes a blissfulness whenever you allow God to flow through
you, whenever you are just an instrument in his hands, when you don't
have any will of your own. That is real war: not to have one's own will,
not to have one's own ego. And that is real victory: to drop it, to get
rid of it, and to be utterly in the hands of god.</p><p>(to Nick)</p><p>Love is the fragrance of the victorious heart. Ordinarily the head is
victorious over the heart, hence man becomes incapable of love. Love
cannot arises out of the head. Out of the head logic is possible,
mathematics is possible, science is possible, business is possible,
politics is possible -- but not love, not poetry, not music, not dance.
They are the qualities of the heart, they are the petals of the flower
of the heart. And man can live either trough the head or through the
heart.</p><p>The whole transformation consists of moving from the head to the
heart. Becomes less calculative, less clinging to the logical pattern,
less businesslike. Be more of a lover. Learn to risk, learn to live
dangerously</p><p>-- only then there is dance and there is music and there is poetry.
Lose the head to gain the heart, and you will be a sannyasin.</p><p>(to Pratibha)</p><p>Intellect and intelligence are two totally different things.
Intellect is part of the head; intelligence is part of the heart. One
can be a great intellectual and yet unintelligent, and one can be very
intelligent and may not be an intellectual at all. A man can be a great
scholar, a great pundit, with no intelligence. He is just like a parrot:
he can quote scriptures but he functions like a machine. He does not
understand what he is saying because he has not experienced it himself;
it is all borrowed. And anything borrowed burdens you, chains you,
imprison you. Only your own experience is liberating.</p><p>Move towards the heart. Let love-intelligence arise in you. It can't
come through scriptures, books, libraries, universities, academic
degrees. It can only come through being more and more meditative, still,
silent. It is not an extrovert effort but an introvert search. And when
love-intelligence blooms life is fulfilled; there is great contentment.
In that contentment one feels gratitude to God, and that</p><p>gratitude is prayer. Before that all prayers are false. (Ma Prem
Vishran: love and relaxation)</p><p>These are the two things you have to enter into: love and relaxation.
They are helpful to each other, 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on

you are relaxed you become loving. And this goes on and on: you love
more, you can relax more; you relax more, you love more. It becomes like
a pyramid, you start going towards some unknown peak where love and
relaxation become one. Then the goal is achieved. When your very being
is relaxed and knows no tensions, then your whole being is just
radiating love -- not to any particualr person but to the whole
existence ... Even if you are sitting alone in a room you go on
radiating love, the room becomes full of the vibe of your love. People
who have eyes to see and hearts to feel, if they come into the room they
will simply fell a different vibe in the room.</p><p>Sometimes even unconscious and blind people have glimpses of that. If
in a certain house there has been a murder and you go in, you know
nothing about the murder but suddenly you feel a tension growing in you
for no reason at all. The whole air seems to be somehow heavy, dark,
evil. If in some place people have been fighting, have been angry,
shouting at each other -- they may have gone, but when you enter the
room it is still echoing, resounding, with the anger, rage, hatred. You
will feel it, as if the room were not empty.</p><p>So is the case if a loving person has been sitting there in the room
alone, if a meditative person has been sitting in the room alone. You
enter the room, suddenly you are showered with a totally new kind of
energy</p><p>-- nourishing. A joy arises in you. You may have been sad but
suddenly entering into the room you feel great joy.</p><p>That's how temples were created in the beginning, but soon they
became</p><p>instruments for cunning people to exploit the innocent. Otherwise the
motive was beautiful, there must be a place where nobody fights, nobody
becomes angry, where everybody goes with a worshipful heart, love,
gratitude, prayer. Slowly slowly the temple accumulates all these
vibrations, it becomes richer and richer. Hence the idea that the more
ancient the temple is, the more significant it is, because it contains
so many people and their beautiful vibes. That was the motive. It didn't
come true: priests jumped in and destroyed all the temples.</p><p>So remember these two things: be loving and be relaxed. These two
commandments are for being a sannyasin.</p><p>(Joost becomes Swami Anand Svarup)</p><p>Bliss is not something external to you, it is something intrinsic to
your very being, it is something that you are made of. So it is not a
question of achieving it, it is only a question of recognizing it,
remembering it. It is as if we had forgotten sothing. It is just on the
tip of the tongue, you say, and yet you can't remember it. It is a very
weird feeling when it happens -- when you know that you know, when you
know that it is just on the tip of your tongue and still can't remember
it. You remember this much -- that you know. It is so clearly, so loudly
there, that one feels simply mystified by the phenomenon -- why is it
not coming up?</p><p>You try this way and that and the more you try, the more difficult it
seems. Out of sheer tiredeness you drop the whole subject, you forget
all about it. Then some time just listening to music or walking in the
garden or just taking a shower suddenly it comes up. Then it is more
mystifying: <em>why</em> has it suddenly come and when you were trying
why was it not coming? In fact when you were trying you became too
tense, and whenever you are too tense you shut up within yourself,
everything closes; and when you are relaxed everything opens up. Because
you were too tense and you wanted it to happen, you really wanted to
<em>force</em> it to come up, it simply slipped into the unconscious.
but when you were not thinking about it at all, not desiring, not
longing for it -- you had completely forgotten the whole matter --
suddenly it popped up in the head. That's how bliss is: we have simply
forgotten; only a little relaxation is needed to remember it.</p><p>All meditation techniques are nothing but techniques for relaxation,
for rest. Learn more relaxation, more rest. The more relaxed you become,
the closer you are to God. When you are totally relaxed your whole being
simply becomes flooded with light, flooded with love, flooded with
bliss. Those are the proofs of</p><p>God and those are the only proofs of God. (Anand Amito: infinite
bliss)</p><p>Bliss has no beginning, no end. It is always there. It is within and
it is without, but we are blind to it. It is just like a blind man
sitting in the sun: all is light but he can't see a thing, he can't see
the light. The light is showering on him, he can even feel the warmth,
but he cannot see the source of it. And that is the situation of all
human beings: in rare moments we can feel a certain warmth of bliss, a
certain wave, but it remains vague. It looks like a faraway echo of
something, but we cannot put our hands on it. We call it happiness.
Happiness is the blind man's experience of light; the blind's man
experience of bliss, that is 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on

eyes. Maybe they don't need any treatment, you have just forgotten how
to open them. Maybe for centuries and lives you have kept them closed.
Or maybe you are going to see; it is better to remain in your closed
world, it is cozy. Otherwise the vast infinite world will be
encountered; it will be challenging, and one shrinks from facing the
infinite. But without facing the infinite we will never know what bliss
is, and our hearts <em>long</em> for it!</p><p>So no happiness satisfies, in fact it leaves a bitter taste in your
mouth. It gives you a glimpse and then it disappears. It disappears, it
frustrates. The heart can only be satisfied with bliss -- nothing less
can make it feel contended.</p><p>And bliss is already there. The whole existence is an ocean of bliss.
We are swimming in it, living in it, but we are never seen it. I would
like to see it! Because the fish is born in the ocean, lives in the
ocean, the ocean is so close that there is no gap, no distance to
perceive it.</p><p>That's the situation with us too: we are living in an infinite,
invisible ocean of bliss. Just a little perceptiveness, a little
sensitivity, a little more awareness, and</p><p>you will start seeing the invisible and you will start hearing the
silent and you will be able to touch and feel the texture of the
intangible.</p><p>(Satyam John: truth, God's gracious gift)</p><p>Truth is not a conclusion or our own efforts, of our own thinking. We
cannot come to truth by logical reasoning. Through logical reasoning we
can only arrive at a certain hypothesis. An hypothesis is only
tentatively true, aproximately true, but never <em>the</em> truth. That
is not the way to come to the truth, because thruth is beyond human
comprehension, beyond our grasp. It can come only as a gift from God. We
have to be open to receive it. It is not an effort but an effortless
surrender: a totally open heart, ready to receive --</p><p>just like a woman's womb, ready to receive. And then the child
grows.</p><p>The real seeker has to become just like a womb ready to receive the
seed from God. It comes, the moment you open it comes. It inevitably
comes and then it grows inside you.</p><p>Once the seed has reached your heart it starts growing. Soon there
will be great greenery in your heart and roses will start opening. But
truth, the seed of truth, comes from God himself. We cannot arrive at it
through any effort of our own. It is not an achievment, it is a
gift.</p><p>It is very difficult to be ready to receive the gift because it goes
against the ego. Ego wants to achieve, ego wants to conquer; hence ego
can only achieve that which is not true, it can achieve only fictitious
phenomena. The ego can become the president of a country -- which is a
fiction. We are playing a great drama; the whole earth functions as the
stage. One can become the prime minister of a country, but that is a
fiction. It is supported by everybody else, hence it looks true, but it
is not true. Ego can achieve only fictions.</p><p>To achieve the truth, that which is, we have to be ready, courageous
enough to put the ego aside, to be egoless, to be humble. And truth
comes inevitably -- just our readiness is missing. Truth goes on
knocking on our hearts but not even a window is open; all is closed.</p><p>My work here consists of opening a few windows in your heart so that
the sun and the wind and the rain can come in. With the sun and with the
wind and with the rain comes God, and his seed which becomes truth one
day blooms in you,</p><p>and you are a Buddha or a Christ.</p><p>Those who say they don't believe in God, they also belong to God.
Those who turn their back towards God, they also belong to God; and as
far as God is concerned they are all saved. This whole universe is
already in the ultimate state: we have just forgotten. We have forgotten
that we need not do anything; we have forgotten that we are already
there, where we would like to be. We have forgotten that we are already
that which we want to be, which we dream about and desire; and we have
never been otherwise But a deep deep sleep has fallen</p><p>over us.</p><p>The function of the Master is not to save you but just to remind you.

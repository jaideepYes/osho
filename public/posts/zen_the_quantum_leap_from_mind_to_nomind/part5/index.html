‌CHAPTER 5
Can a circle be more circular?
15 June 1988 pm in Gautam the Buddha Auditorium
BELOVED OSHO,
BASO SAID TO HIS MASTER, NANGAKU, “THE WAY IS FORMLESS. HOW CAN WE SEE IT WELL?”
NANGAKU ANSWERED, “IT IS LIKE THE EYE OF THE LAW, POSSESSED BY THE GROUND OF MIND SEEING CLEARLY THE WAY, THE SAMADHI OF NO-FORM.”

IF WE TAKE A LANTERN AS FORM, WHAT IS THE MIND?”\nENKEI SAID, “YOU DON’T UNDERSTAND THE MEANING OF THE ANCIENTS.” THE MONK ASKED, “WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THE ANCIENTS?”\nENKEI SAID, “THE LANTERN IS THE MIND.”\nIN ANOTHER INCIDENT, THE MASTER, HOGEN, POINTED TO SOME BAMBOOS, AND SAID TO A MONK, “DO YOU SEE THEM?”\n“I SEE THEM,” REPLIED THE MONK.\n“DO THEY COME TO THE EYE, OR DOES THE EYE GO TO THEM?” ASKED HOGEN. “I HAVE NO IDEA AT ALL,” SAID THE MONK.\nHOGEN GAVE UP AND WENT AWAY.\nVimal, the first thing you have to understand is that by becoming a dangerous, ferocious animal you gave migraine to poor Maneesha. Remember it always, falling below humanity and then sitting behind a poor girl... It is fortunate that she is still alive, you have done everything to kill her.\nAs a gorilla you were dancing with her: I had left the place, just because I did not want to see the dance of a gorilla. And you see the result now? Be ashamed! Give your gorilla dress to Sardar Gurudayal Singh; it does not suit you. It will suit Sardar Gurudayal Singh anywhere. He can go into the city and freak out people. He does it anyway, but in a gorilla dress, and with his laughter... Sardar Gurudayal Singh!\n(HIS LOUD LAUGHTER IS HEARD FROM THE BACK OF THE HALL.)\nTake that gorilla dress from Vimal tomorrow. And as the dress reaches you, the migraine of Maneesha will disappear. It is not migraine, it is simply fear that – who knows – that gorilla may be sitting behind her again.\nYou have asked, Vimal:\nBASO SAID TO HIS MASTER, NANGAKU,\n“THE WAY IS FORMLESS. HOW CAN WE SEE IT WELL?”\nThe question is very logical and rational. If the way is formless, obviously you cannot see it. To see anything it has to be objective, with a form. If it has no form, if it is infinite, how can you see it?\nBaso in his own right later on proved to be one of the greatest masters, but even while he was a disciple of Nangaku, his master, his questions were immensely important. “THE WAY IS FORMLESS.” That’s what Buddha said, so there is every support for his question. And now he is asking Nangaku, “HOW CAN WE SEE IT WELL?”\nBut Nangaku was not in any way a smaller master. NANGAKU ANSWERED, “IT IS LIKE THE EYE OF THE LAW, POSSESSED BY THE GROUND OF MIND SEEING CLEARLY THE WAY, THE SAMADHI OF NO-FORM.”\nThe answer seems to be absolutely absurd: what he is saying makes no sense. He is saying, “There are thousands of samadhis, graves of people who have seen it and declared it as formless. I am not the only one. Its formlessness does not prevent its being seen; you just need a different vision, a different eye.” In Yoga they have called it ‘the third eye’, which can see the infinite.\nIT IS LIKE THE EYE OF THE LAW. The word ‘law’ is a wrong translation of ‘dharma’. It is always difficult changing great things from one language to another. The Sanskrit ‘dharma’, the Pali ‘dhamma’ can mean religion and can also mean the law, because religion is nothing but the law of existence, the very order of this universe.\nNANGAKU ANSWERED, “IT IS LIKE THE EYE OF THE LAW, POSSESSED BY THE GROUND OF\nMIND. Underneath your mind there are roots of your being, which possess your ultimate vision, the third eyeSEEING CLEARLY THE WAY, THE SAMADHI OF NO-FORM.”\nThis whole existence has no limitations, nowhere is the boundary. Now physicists are in difficulty... These small questions and these small anecdotes have become tremendously significant for modern physicists, because they also are questioning if the universe has limits; and then you have to accept something which you have not seen! Nobody has seen the boundary where the universe ends: it is purely a hypothesis.\nUp to now science has been trying to believe that somewhere far away, millions and trillions of light- years away, there must be a boundary. They say that everything has a boundary: we may not be able to see it, but it has to be there. But that is only an assumption. With Albert Einstein’s researches the assumption has fallen down. One of the greatest achievements of Albert Einstein was to make the universe free from boundaries. His work is as important as the work of all the mystics of the world.\nThe mystics have been trying to make your consciousness boundary-less. Albert Einstein tried to make this whole universe unbounded, unlimited, infinite, although there is no way to prove it. But nor can the contrary be proved either. In the absence of contrary proof it seems to be rational to accept, at least as a hypothesis, that existence has no boundary. It cannot have, because to make a boundary you will need another existence. Who will make the boundary? What will be beyond the boundary? And if there is still something beyond the boundary, it is still the universe. It can be seen very simply that boundaries don’t belong to existence.\nBut mystics are not concerned with the objective world. Their concern is with the inner world, the inner universe of consciousness. Has it a form? And if there is no form, how can you see when somebody is self-realized? How can you see that you have seen yourself? Only form can be seen.\nNangaku changes the whole situation. He says, “It is not a question of your ordinary eyes. Of course they can only see the form, but deep in your very being is a capacity to know the formless”.\nBut Baso was no ordinary disciple.\nBASO SAID, “CAN IT PROGRESS OR DECAY? I accept your hypothesis, but I have a few questions.” Baso says, “Can it progress, the no-form, the unlimited consciousness, can it progress or decay?”\nHe is putting his master to a fire test.\nNANGAKU REPLIED, “IF IT IS SEEN AS PROGRESSING AND DECAYING, BECOMING FIRM AND DISPERSING, IT IS NOT SEEN.”\nTo ask whether perfection can be more perfect is absurd. Perfection is perfection: it cannot be more, it cannot be less. Take a small example: can a circle be more circular, or less circular? A circle is a circle; it can be neither more circular, nor less circular.\n“Your very question shows,” Nangaku said to Baso, “that you have not seen it. Your third eye is still fast asleep. Your mind is young, your intelligence is great, but your inner eye has not yet opened; it is a bud, it has not become a rose.”\nANOTHER MASTER, ENKEI, WAS ASKED BY A MONK, “IT IS SAID THAT IF WE SEE THE FORM OF THINGS, WE SEE THE MIND. IF WE TAKE A LANTERN AS FORM, WHAT IS THE MIND?”\nENKEI SAID, “YOU DON’T UNDERSTAND THE MEANING OF THE ANCIENTS.” THE MONK ASKED, “WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THE ANCIENTS?”\nENKEI SAID, “THE LANTERN IS THE MIND.”\nThis is something to be understood. When you bring something before a mirror, it reflects it so perfectly that you can say that the mirror has become it. If the mind can see... it is a mirror. Your eyes are mirrors and nothing else. They reflect. And in reflecting they become things, whatever they reflect.\nLooking into a person’s eyes, you can discover his whole personality, his whole psychology, his whole mind and the mask. The eyes reflect not only the outside world, they also reflect your inner world: how deep you are, whether you are just a surface, a thin layer of water that reflects, or an ocean.\nWhen Baso became the master himself, succeeding his own master Nangaku, before initiating any disciple he used to look into their eyes. He would bring the disciple closer and look into his eyes. And Baso looking into your eyes is almost as if you are in the hands of a lion. Just by his look... the penetration of his vision was as sharp as a razor blade. He had made a few people enlightened just by looking into their eyes. Their minds disappear: they cannot confront the eyes of the master, Baso. Baso is a very rare master.\nTHE MONK ASKED, “WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THE ANCIENTS?” ENKEI SAID, “THE LANTERN IS THE MIND.”\nWhen you are seeing the lantern, if you are not wavering within, in a very miraculous way, the reflection and the reflected become one, the observed and the observer become one, the loved and the lover become one.\nIn such small statements so much is hidden that on each statement a great philosophy can be based.\nIN ANOTHER INCIDENT, THE MASTER, HOGEN, POINTED TO SOME BAMBOOS, AND SAID TO A MONK, “DO YOU SEE THEM?”\n“I SEE THEM,” REPLIED THE MONK, not understanding that when a master asks you, “Do you see it?” he does not mean your ordinary eyes. A master’s finger is always pointing to the inner, not to the outer. But the poor monk thought that the master is asking whether he can see the bamboos.\n“YES, I SEE THEM,” REPLIED THE MONK.\n“DO THEY COME TO THE EYE, OR DOES THE EYE GO TO THEM?”\nHow do you manage to see? Somebody has to go: either your eyes go to the bamboos, or the bamboos come to your eyes. Which way does it happen?\n“I HAVE NO IDEA AT ALL,” SAID THE MONK, feeling utterly defeated, not knowing what to say, because the fact is, no one goes, no one comes. The eyes are in their place and the bamboos are in their place. There is no going and there is no coming. Do you think when the full moon is reflected in the silent lake, the lake goes to the moon, or the moon comes to the lake? The moon remains in its place, the lake remains in its place, but the lake’s silence, its mirrorlike surface reflects.\nThe poor monk could not say that: “Nobody goes, nobody comes, everything is in its own place, there is no coming, there is no going.”\nBecause he could not answer, HOGEN GAVE UP AND WENT AWAY.\nHogen was a very strict master, not as compassionate as Baso or Gautam Buddha. He had the same experience, but he was very stern with his disciples, always wanting them to answer rightly. You could not deceive Hogen, nor could you ask for any compassion from him.\nHe used to say, “All compassion is dangerous,” because what is the inner implication of compassion? It means allowing ignorance. He would not allow any ignorance: he would chop your head if it was needed, but compassion was not his method.\nRather than explaining to the disciple, he simply left and went away, without saying a word. This is his way of saying, “You are not worthy of me, you are not worthy of Zen. You cannot answer a simple thing, that in a reflection nothing goes, nothing comes, everything remains in its place.” And in existence the case is the same: no going, no coming – just be.\nYou can feel here, nothing is going, nothing is coming, a tremendous silence. The bamboos are not even making their commentary.\nQuestion 1\nPoor Maneesha is not here, but her question is. She has asked, BELOVED OSHO,\nTHANK YOU – THANK EXISTENCE – THANK YOU – THAT YOU DON’T GIVE UP AS EASILY AS HOGEN.\nBut Maneesha, where are you? The master is here and the disciple has given up! And this whole mess is being created by Vimal who is sitting in front of me.\nAlthough you are not here, your question is significant for everyone. I am not Hogen. I will haunt you even in your graves! I will see you, however far you escape. I am haunting already all over the world and I am still alive. Once I am dead, then this world cannot prevent me; no law, no parliament, no country can make barriers for me; then I will be all over the place, tickling people to wake up. Even now I am not doing anything nasty to anybody, just tickling.\nAnd I want you to remember that there are always a few stupid people, who come here out of curiosity. If you find any stupid person around you, not doing the gibberish, tickle! Do it from all sides; it is a religious duty. Don’t leave the poor fellow alone. He should not go home the same as he came here. He should go laughing, forgetting all his misery and business. So while you are doing your gibberish, just take care that nobody is sitting silent. When you are silent, then take care that nobody is moving.\nThis is not an ordinary assembly, a crowd, this is a place where everybody has to become enlightened, in spite of himself!\nI am a different kind of man, Maneesha.\nBefore you start your gibberish... from today I will not move my hands, I will watch you. And if I see somebody sitting silently, I am going to point. Then whoever he is, just tickle him. I have tickled you enough. Now it is your dharma!\nBefore our meditation begins I have to prepare the ground for you.\nSwami Deva Coconut has a terrible pain in his back. When it becomes unbearable, he reluctantly goes to Ruby Hall clinic to visit Doctor Ekdam Kwality, the specialist, to have him diagnose his problem.\nDoctor Ekdam Kwality examines Coconut carefully, takes an X-ray and asks him to come back the next day.\nWhen Coconut returns, Ekdam Kwality says, “Well, I have studied the X-ray carefully, and your problem can be cured by an operation, followed by two weeks in the hospital, and then six months lying on your back – at an approximate cost of twenty-five thousand rupees!”\n“Jesus Christ,” cries Coconut, “I can’t afford all that!”\n“Okay,” says Ekdam Kwality. “Then for twenty-five rupees I can retouch the X-ray!”\nAfter ten years of marriage, Boris and Betty Bunkovitz get divorced. Betty wins custody of their young son, Bert, and three hundred dollars a month in child support from Boris.\nOn the first of every month, Betty sends Bert to Boris to pick up the money. And every month the check is waiting.\nOn his eighteenth birthday, Bert goes once again to Boris. But this time, as Boris hands Bert the check, Boris says, “Bert, when you give this check to your mother, tell her it is the last check I am going to send her... and watch the expression on her face!”\nReturning home, Bert says to Betty,\n“Mum, Boris told me to watch the expression on your face when I tell you that this is your last check.”\n“Is that so?” says Betty. “Then, I want you to go straight back over there and watch the expression on Boris’ face, when you tell him that he is not your father!”\nSardar Gurudayal Singh from Poona decides to go to Singapore for some shopping. He goes into a shop, dressed in his best flowing robes, curly shoes and turban, and asks, “What is the price of that video machine in the window?”\nThe salesman answers, “Sorry, sir, we don’t sell to Indians.”\nTo Sardar Gurudayal Singh this is very shocking. He goes back to his hotel and dresses as an Englishman in a pin-striped suit, with all his hair pushed up into a bowler hat. Back at the shop he asks, “My good man, what is the price of that video in the window?”\nTo his dismay the seller replies, “Sorry, sir, we don’t sell to Indians!”\nSo this time Sardar Gurudayal Singh dresses as an American. He lets all his hair down, puts on Bermuda shorts, T-shirt and sunglasses, and goes back into the shop. “Hey, man!” he says. “How much for that far-out video machine?” But he gets the same reply. In exasperation Sardar Gurudayal Singh cries, “How do you know that I am an Indian?”\n“That is easy,” replies the seller. “The article in the window that you desire is not a video, it is a washing machine!”\nRupesh, give the first beat and everybody goes into gibberish. (Drumbeat)\n(Gibberish)\n(OSHO WATCHES VERY CAREFULLY, LOOKING SLOWLY FROM FAR LEFT TO FAR RIGHT, HIS FINGER READY TO POINT TO ANYBODY WHO IS NOT DOING THE GIBBERISH PROPERLY!)\nRupesh... (Drumbeat) Be silent,\nthe way the bamboos are silent.\nJust be,\nclose your eyes and be within. No movement,\neither of the mind or of the body... Just be!\nNow and here, a pure isness.\nDeeper and deeper... Don’t spare anything.\nYou have nothing to lose\nby going deeper into yourself, but everything to gain.\nAt the very center of your being\nis the door of the kingdom of God. You don’t even have to open it;\nit is open, it is waiting.\nCome in. You are always welcome, come in!\nRupesh, give the beat... (Drumbeat)\nEverybody falls dead. Let your body breathe; relax totally\nso that you can move even deeper\ninto your being.\nHave the taste of this tremendous silence, feel the beatitude of this moment.\nThis is what I have called the quantum leap, from mind to no-mind.\nRupesh, call the dead back to life, give the drum a good beat... (Drumbeat)\nOne more... (Drumbeat)\nCome back, fresh and alive, coming from the innermost sources of your life\nand consciousness. Fresh and fragrant, fearless and free, just pure individuals\nas existence always wanted you to be. Okay, Vimal?\nYes, Osho.\nCan we celebrate?\nYES!\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"3065","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/zen_the_quantum_leap_from_mind_to_nomind/part5/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/zen_the_quantum_leap_from_mind_to_nomind/>Zen.

result now? Be ashamed! Give your gorilla dress to Sardar Gurudayal
Singh; it does not suit you. It will suit Sardar Gurudayal Singh
anywhere. He can go into the city and freak out people. He does it
anyway, but in a gorilla dress, and with his laughter... Sardar
Gurudayal Singh!</p><p><br></p><p>(HIS LOUD LAUGHTER IS HEARD FROM THE BACK OF THE HALL.)</p><p><br></p><p>Take that gorilla dress from Vimal tomorrow. And as the dress reaches
you, the migraine of Maneesha will disappear. It is not migraine, it is
simply fear that – who knows – that gorilla may be sitting behind her
again.</p><p><br></p><p>You have asked, Vimal:</p><p><br></p><p>BASO SAID TO HIS MASTER, NANGAKU,</p><p><br></p><p>“THE WAY IS FORMLESS. HOW CAN WE SEE IT WELL?”</p><p><br></p><p>The question is very logical and rational. If the way is formless,
obviously you cannot see it. To see anything it has to be objective,
with a form. If it has no form, if it is infinite, how can you see
it?</p><p><br></p><p>Baso in his own right later on proved to be one of the greatest
masters, but even while he was a disciple of Nangaku, his master, his
questions were immensely important. “THE WAY IS FORMLESS.” That’s what
Buddha said, so there is every support for his question. And now he is
asking Nangaku, “HOW CAN WE SEE IT WELL?”</p><p><br></p><p>But Nangaku was not in any way a smaller master. NANGAKU ANSWERED,
“IT IS LIKE THE EYE OF THE LAW, POSSESSED BY THE GROUND OF MIND SEEING
CLEARLY THE WAY, THE SAMADHI OF NO-FORM.”</p><p><br></p><p>The answer seems to be absolutely absurd: what he is saying makes no
sense. He is saying, “There are thousands of samadhis, graves of people
who have seen it and declared it as formless. I am not the only one. Its
formlessness does not prevent its being seen; you just need a different
vision, a different eye.” In Yoga they have called it ‘the third eye’,
which can see the infinite.</p><p>IT IS LIKE THE EYE OF THE LAW. The word ‘law’ is a wrong translation
of ‘dharma’. It is always difficult changing great things from one
language to another. The Sanskrit ‘dharma’, the Pali ‘dhamma’ can mean
religion and can also mean the law, because religion is nothing but the
law of existence, the very order of this universe.</p><p><br></p><p>NANGAKU ANSWERED, “IT IS LIKE THE EYE OF THE LAW, POSSESSED BY THE
GROUND OF</p><p>MIND. Underneath your mind there are roots of your being, which
possess your ultimate vision, the third eye<span class=s4></span>SEEING CLEARLY THE WAY, THE SAMADHI OF NO-FORM.”</p><p><br></p><p>This whole existence has no limitations, nowhere is the boundary. Now
physicists are in difficulty... These small questions and these small
anecdotes have become tremendously significant for modern physicists,
because they also are questioning if the universe has limits; and then
you have to accept something which you have not seen! Nobody has seen
the boundary where the universe ends: it is purely a hypothesis.</p><p><br></p><p>Up to now science has been trying to believe that somewhere far away,
millions and trillions of light- years away, there must be a boundary.
They say that everything has a boundary: we may not be able to see it,
but it has to be there. But that is only an assumption. With Albert
Einstein’s researches the assumption has fallen down. One of the
greatest achievements of Albert Einstein was to make the universe free
from boundaries. His work is as important as the work of all the mystics
of the world.</p><p><br></p><p>The mystics have been trying to make your consciousness
boundary-less. Albert Einstein tried to make this whole universe
unbounded, unlimited, infinite, although there is no way to prove it.
But nor can the contrary be proved either. In the absence of contrary
proof it seems to be rational to accept, at least as a hypothesis, that
existence has no boundary. It cannot have, because to make a boundary
you will need another existence. Who will make the boundary? What will
be beyond the boundary? And if there is still something beyond the
boundary, it is still the universe. It can be seen very simply that
boundaries don’t belong to existence.</p><p><br></p><p>But mystics are not concerned with the objective world. Their concern
is with the inner world, the inner universe of consciousness. Has it a
form? And if there is no form, how can you see when somebody is
self-realized? How can you see that you have seen yourself? Only form
can be seen.</p><p><br></p><p>Nangaku changes the whole situation. He says, “It is not a question
of your ordinary eyes. Of course they can only see the form, but deep in
your very being is a capacity to know the formless”.</p><p><br></p><p>But Baso was no ordinary disciple.</p><p><br></p><p>BASO SAID, “CAN IT PROGRESS OR DECAY? I accept your hypothesis, but I
have a few questions.” Baso says, “Can it progress, the no-form, the
unlimited consciousness, can it progress or decay?”</p><p><br></p><p>He is putting his master to a fire test.</p><p><br></p><p>NANGAKU REPLIED, “IF IT IS SEEN AS PROGRESSING AND DECAYING, BECOMING
FIRM AND DISPERSING, IT IS NOT SEEN.”</p><p>To ask whether perfection can be more perfect is absurd. Perfection
is perfection: it cannot be more, it cannot be less. Take a small
example: can a circle be more circular, or less circular? A circle is a
circle; it can be neither more circular, nor less circular.</p><p><br></p><p>“Your very question shows,” Nangaku said to Baso, “that you have not
seen it. Your third eye is still fast asleep. Your mind is young, your
intelligence is great, but your inner eye has not yet opened; it is a
bud, it has not become a rose.”</p><p><br></p><p>ANOTHER MASTER, ENKEI, WAS ASKED BY A MONK, “IT IS SAID THAT IF WE
SEE THE FORM OF THINGS, WE SEE THE MIND. IF WE TAKE A LANTERN AS FORM,
WHAT IS THE MIND?”</p><p><br></p><p>ENKEI SAID, “YOU DON’T UNDERSTAND THE MEANING OF THE ANCIENTS.” THE
MONK ASKED, “WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THE ANCIENTS?”</p><p>ENKEI SAID, “THE LANTERN IS THE MIND.”</p><p><br></p><p>This is something to be understood. When you bring something before a
mirror, it reflects it so perfectly that you can say that the mirror has
become it. If the mind can see... it is a mirror. Your eyes are mirrors
and nothing else. They reflect. And in reflecting they become things,
whatever they reflect.</p><p><br></p><p>Looking into a person’s eyes, you can discover his whole personality,
his whole psychology, his whole mind and the mask. The eyes reflect not
only the outside world, they also reflect your inner world: how deep you
are, whether you are just a surface, a thin layer of water that
reflects, or an ocean.</p><p><br></p><p>When Baso became the master himself, succeeding his own master
Nangaku, before initiating any disciple he used to look into their eyes.
He would bring the disciple closer and look into his eyes. And Baso
looking into your eyes is almost as if you are in the hands of a lion.
Just by his look... the penetration of his vision was as sharp as a
razor blade. He had made a few people enlightened just by looking into
their eyes. Their minds disappear: they cannot confront the eyes of the
master, Baso. Baso is a very rare master.</p><p><br></p><p>THE MONK ASKED, “WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THE ANCIENTS?” ENKEI SAID,
“THE LANTERN IS THE MIND.”</p><p>When you are seeing the lantern, if you are not wavering within, in a
very miraculous way, the reflection and the reflected become one, the
observed and the observer become one, the loved and the lover become
one.</p><p><br></p><p>In such small statements so much is hidden that on each statement a
great philosophy can be based.</p><p><br></p><p>IN ANOTHER INCIDENT, THE MASTER, HOGEN, POINTED TO SOME BAMBOOS, AND
SAID TO A MONK, “DO YOU SEE THEM?”</p><p>“I SEE THEM,” REPLIED THE MONK, not understanding that when a master
asks you, “Do you see it?” he does not mean your ordinary eyes. A
master’s finger is always pointing to the inner, not to the outer. But
the poor monk thought that the master is asking whether he can see the
bamboos.</p><p><br></p><p>“YES, I SEE THEM,” REPLIED THE MONK.</p><p><br></p><p>“DO THEY COME TO THE EYE, OR DOES THE EYE GO TO THEM?”</p><p><br></p><p>How do you manage to see? Somebody has to go: either your eyes go to
the bamboos, or the bamboos come to your eyes. Which way does it
happen?</p><p><br></p><p>“I HAVE NO IDEA AT ALL,” SAID THE MONK, feeling utterly defeated, not
knowing what to say, because the fact is, no one goes, no one comes. The
eyes are in their place and the bamboos are in their place. There is no
going and there is no coming. Do you think when the full moon is
reflected in the silent lake, the lake goes to the moon, or the moon
comes to the lake? The moon remains in its place, the lake remains in
its place, but the lake’s silence, its mirrorlike surface reflects.</p><p><br></p><p>The poor monk could not say that: “Nobody goes, nobody comes,
everything is in its own place, there is no coming, there is no
going.”</p><p><br></p><p>Because he could not answer, HOGEN GAVE UP AND WENT AWAY.</p><p><br></p><p>Hogen was a very strict master, not as compassionate as Baso or
Gautam Buddha. He had the same experience, but he was very stern with
his disciples, always wanting them to answer rightly. You could not
deceive Hogen, nor could you ask for any compassion from him.</p><p><br></p><p>He used to say, “All compassion is dangerous,” because what is the
inner implication of compassion? It means allowing ignorance. He would
not allow any ignorance: he would chop your head if it was needed, but
compassion was not his method.</p><p><br></p><p>Rather than explaining to the disciple, he simply left and went away,
without saying a word. This is his way of saying, “You are not worthy of
me, you are not worthy of Zen. You cannot answer a simple thing, that in
a reflection nothing goes, nothing comes, everything remains in its
place.” And in existence the case is the same: no going, no coming –
just be.</p><p><br></p><p>You can feel here, nothing is going, nothing is coming, a tremendous
silence. The bamboos are not even making their commentary.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 1</p><p><br></p><p>Poor Maneesha is not here, but her question is. She has asked,
BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>THANK YOU – THANK EXISTENCE – THANK YOU – THAT YOU DON’T GIVE UP AS
EASILY AS HOGEN.</p><p>But Maneesha, where are you? The master is here and the disciple has
given up! And this whole mess is being created by Vimal who is sitting
in front of me.</p><p><br></p><p>Although you are not here, your question is significant for everyone.
I am not Hogen. I will haunt you even in your graves! I will see you,
however far you escape. I am haunting already all over the world and I
am still alive. Once I am dead, then this world cannot prevent me; no
law, no parliament, no country can make barriers for me; then I will be
all over the place, tickling people to wake up. Even now I am not doing
anything nasty to anybody, just tickling.</p><p><br></p><p>And I want you to remember that there are always a few stupid people,
who come here out of curiosity. If you find any stupid person around
you, not doing the gibberish, tickle! Do it from all sides; it is a
religious duty. Don’t leave the poor fellow alone. He should not go home
the same as he came here. He should go laughing, forgetting all his
misery and business. So while you are doing your gibberish, just take
care that nobody is sitting silent. When you are silent, then take care
that nobody is moving.</p><p><br></p><p>This is not an ordinary assembly, a crowd, this is a place where
everybody has to become enlightened, in spite of himself!</p><p><br></p><p>I am a different kind of man, Maneesha.</p><p><br></p><p>Before you start your gibberish... from today I will not move my
hands, I will watch you. And if I see somebody sitting silently, I am
going to point. Then whoever he is, just tickle him. I have tickled you
enough. Now it is your dharma!</p><p><br></p><p>Before our meditation begins I have to prepare the ground for
you.</p><p><br></p><p>Swami Deva Coconut has a terrible pain in his back. When it becomes
unbearable, he reluctantly goes to Ruby Hall clinic to visit Doctor
Ekdam Kwality, the specialist, to have him diagnose his problem.</p><p><br></p><p>Doctor Ekdam Kwality examines Coconut carefully, takes an X-ray and
asks him to come back the next day.</p><p><br></p><p>When Coconut returns, Ekdam Kwality says, “Well, I have studied the
X-ray carefully, and your problem can be cured by an operation, followed
by two weeks in the hospital, and then six months lying on your back –
at an approximate cost of twenty-five thousand rupees!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Jesus Christ,” cries Coconut, “I can’t afford all that!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay,” says Ekdam Kwality. “Then for twenty-five rupees I can
retouch the X-ray!”</p><p><br></p><p>After ten years of marriage, Boris and Betty Bunkovitz get divorced.
Betty wins custody of their young son, Bert, and three hundred dollars a
month in child support from Boris.</p><p><br></p><p>On the first of every month, Betty sends Bert to Boris to pick up the
money. And every month the check is waiting.</p><p>On his eighteenth birthday, Bert goes once again to Boris. But this
time, as Boris hands Bert the check, Boris says, “Bert, when you give
this check to your mother, tell her it is the last check I am going to
send her... and watch the expression on her face!”</p><p><br></p><p>Returning home, Bert says to Betty,</p><p><br></p><p>“Mum, Boris told me to watch the expression on your face when I tell
you that this is your last check.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Is that so?” says Betty. “Then, I want you to go straight back over
there and watch the expression on Boris’ face, when you tell him that he
is not your father!”</p><p><br></p><p>Sardar Gurudayal Singh from Poona decides to go to Singapore for some
shopping. He goes into a shop, dressed in his best flowing robes, curly
shoes and turban, and asks, “What is the price of that video machine in
the window?”</p><p><br></p><p>The salesman answers, “Sorry, sir, we don’t sell to Indians.”</p><p><br></p><p>To Sardar Gurudayal Singh this is very shocking. He goes back to his
hotel and dresses as an Englishman in a pin-striped suit, with all his
hair pushed up into a bowler hat. Back at the shop he asks, “My good
man, what is the price of that video in the window?”</p><p><br></p><p>To his dismay the seller replies, “Sorry, sir, we don’t sell to
Indians!”</p><p><br></p><p>So this time Sardar Gurudayal Singh dresses as an American. He lets
all his hair down, puts on Bermuda shorts, T-shirt and sunglasses, and
goes back into the shop. “Hey, man!” he says. “How much for that far-out
video machine?” But he gets the same reply. In exasperation Sardar
Gurudayal Singh cries, “How do you know that I am an Indian?”</p><p><br></p><p>“That is easy,” replies the seller. “The article in the window that
you desire is not a video, it is a washing machine!”</p><p><br></p><p>Rupesh, give the first beat and everybody goes into gibberish.

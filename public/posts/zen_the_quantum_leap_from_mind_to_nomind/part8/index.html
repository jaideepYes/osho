HE IS WELL VERSED IN THIS MATTER. ASK HIM, PLEASE.”\nAFTER KOKUSHI’S DEATH, THE EMPEROR SENT FOR TANGEN AND ASKED HIM ABOUT IT. TANGEN SAID,\n“SOUTH OF SHO AND NORTH OF TAN, IN BETWEEN, GOLD ABOUNDS.\nTHE FERRYBOAT UNDER THE SHADOWLESS TREE, NO HOLY ONE IN THE EMERALD PALACE YOU SEE.”\nManeesha, this evening and this silence, this great assembly of people who love is really the answer to the anecdote you have asked about. That’s what the emperor could not understand when he asked, “What kind, what style of pagoda, of temple do you want to be erected?”\nThe master remained silent. Except silence, what can represent a Buddha, a Basho, a Nan-Sen? Only silence.\nI will read the anecdote. Listen as silently as possible because your silence is the answer that has been raised in the anecdote.\nA MONK ASKED SEIKE, “WHERE DOES A MONK GO WHEN HE DIES AND TRANSMIGRATES?”\nIn the first place it is a stupid question because a man of enlightenment never dies, never transmigrates either. Transmigration is for the ignorant, from one form into another form, from one animalhood to another animalhood. But for the awakened, for the enlightened there is no death and no transmigration. He simply defuses into the wholeness of the cosmos.\nHe does not leave even his steps and their marks behind him just like a snowflake disappearing or an echo in the mountains.\nHe simply drops his bondage and makes the whole sky his being. He is everywhere and he is nowhere in particular.\nSEIKE SAID, “THE CHOKO FLOWS” – Choko is the name of a river. “THE CHOKO FLOWS ON AND ON, NEVER STOPPING; BUBBLES OBEY THE VAGARIES OF THE WIND.” That’s the language\nZen prefers, the language of pure poetry, of pure music, of pure dance.\nThe Choko river flows on and on. It has been flowing for centuries or perhaps for millions of years and it will go on flowing; in the same way the enlightened one disappears into the ocean, drops the small cage that he used to think was himself – his personality, his ego. Just like a drop of dew slipping from the lotus leaf and merging into the ocean, he disappears to appear everywhere. You have to risk to be nowhere if you want to be everywhere. But it is a good bargain.\nSEIKE SAID, “THE CHOKO FLOWS ON AND ON, NEVER STOPPING; BUBBLES OBEY THE VAGARIES OF THE WIND.”\nOnly bubbles go here and there, transmigrate, follow the vagaries of the wind. Fashions and moods and emotions are nothing but soap bubbles. They move from one form into another form, from one place into another place. But the river itself simply continues. Just feel the silent river in which you are at this moment. This silence is eternal: it has always been here and it will always remain here.\nTHE MONK ASKED FURTHER, “DOES HE RECEIVE THE CEREMONIAL OFFERINGS?”\nThe monk must have been a super-idiot. He has not heard what Seiko has said. He again repeats the same question from a different angle. “When the master is dead, does he receive the ceremonial offerings?”\nSEIKE SAID, “WE CAN’T SAY THERE ARE NO CEREMONIAL OFFERINGS.” “WHAT EXACTLY ARE THESE OFFERINGS?” ASKED THE MONK.\nSEIKE SAID, “AS THE FISHERMAN’S SONG PUSHES THE OAR, HIS VOICE IS HEARD IN THE VALLEYS.”\nThese offerings to the enlightened ones may be just a few roseflowers. He is asking whether they are received or not. That is not an authentic seeker’s question. The question is whether you are offering or not. Those hands which could receive those flowers are no more encaged in flesh, in bones. And when you offer your love, your gratitude will be heard just as the echo of a fisherman’s song pushes the oar and his voice is heard in the valleys.\nIt is difficult to talk about because of the very nature of the phenomenon. Once you become enlightened, you are no longer – in the old sense. You are absolutely discontinuous with the old: the jump is quantum so the old language becomes absolutely inapplicable. All that can be said is: offerings are made; the whole existence receives them; no individual hands are going to receive your offerings.\nAnd the very desire that your offerings should be received is basically wrong: your offerings should be unconditional. They should be out of your love, not out of your desire, not out of any demand. It is just a joy, a dance that a few human beings have disappeared into the cosmic whole.\nYour offering is simply a symbolic indication that you would also like to disappear like an echo, slowly, slowly, not leaving any trace behind; just as a bird flies but does not leave footprints in the sky.\nBEFORE CHU KOKUSHI DIED, EMPEROR SHUKUSHO ASKED HIM, “WHEN YOU ARE A HUNDRED YEARS OLD, WHAT SHALL I DO FOR YOU?”\nKOKUSHI ANSWERED, “MAKE A SEAMLESS PAGODA FOR THIS OLD MONK.” THE EMPEROR SAID, “I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU, WHAT STYLE IS IT TO BE?”\nKOKUSHI REMAINED SILENT FOR A WHILE – this silence was the answer. But only those who are silent can understand the language of silence. Only those whose hearts are present in the moment can dance.\nBut the emperor could not understand Kokushi and his silence. After a while he said, “DO YOU UNDERSTAND?”\n“NO, I DO NOT,” SAID THE EMPEROR.\n“I HAVE A DISCIPLE CALLED TANGEN,” SAID KOKUSHI, “WHO HAD THE DHARMA SEAL TRANSMITTED BY ME. HE IS WELL VERSED IN THIS MATTER. ASK HIM, PLEASE.”\nThe emperor has not understood the master because the master will not descend from his silence. He sends him to a disciple.\nAFTER KOKUSHI’S DEATH, THE EMPEROR SENT FOR TANGEN AND ASKED HIM ABOUT IT. TANGEN SAID, “SOUTH OF SHO AND NORTH OF TAN, IN BETWEEN, GOLD ABOUNDS.”\nBetween these two mountains, gold abounds.\n“THE FERRYBOAT UNDER THE SHADOWLESS TREE”... Just see how Zen is more pictorial than linguistic.\n“THE FERRYBOAT UNDER THE SHADOWLESS TREE, NO HOLY ONE IN THE EMERALD PALACE YOU SEE.”\nThe anecdote ends because the emperor could not see the heart of silence, the heart of the universal music, the language of the shadows and the poetry of love. But you should not miss. Do you understand? In this silence is the whole secret.\nQuestion 1 Maneesha has asked:\nBELOVED OSHO,\nWHENEVER I TRY TO DIE EACH NIGHT – TO CLOSE DOWN MY SENSES AND BE DEAD – I ONLY FEEL LIFE TRYING TO ASSERT ITSELF MORE VIGOROUSLY. AM I DOING IT WRONGLY OR IS THAT WHAT IS MEANT TO HAPPEN? OR ARE THERE NO “MEANT TO HAPPENS” HERE?\nManeesha, it is meant to happen. I am a teacher of life, not of death; but I can teach you only if you are ready even to die for life. Already you are so dead, and still you believe through your whole life that you are alive. But this life is lukewarm. Hence in the meditation I try to help you, to push you deeper into death because as far as I am concerned death is a fiction. The whole intention is that as you try to be more and more dead, you will find life asserting itself.\nIt is a very deep dialectical process. The more you try to die, the more you will find yourself fresh and young and newly born. I teach resurrection. Jesus should not have the monopoly of being resurrected, it is everybody’s right. You don’t have to hang on a cross, you can simply die here. You can just leave the body and go in, fearlessly, because there is the eternal treasure of being.\nThere is no question of losing anything; relax totally so that all energy moves inwards, gathers inwards, becomes a concentrated phenomenon. That’s why you are feeling more alive. I want you to be more alive – alive forever, because that is your nature; only recognition is needed.\nMeditation is simply a method to recognize the eternity of life and the fiction of death.\nThis silence is so precious that even the bamboos are not making commentaries today. But I will still give them a little chance to laugh. Laughter dignifies you because no animal laughs. Laughter proves life because dead men don’t laugh.\nLittle Muni Bramachappati, youngest daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Rama Bramachappati, a fifteen-year- old child, is suddenly awakened by deep moaning and groaning coming from the neighbor’s flat in “D” building, Popular Heights.\nSleepy-eyed, she goes into her parents’ room and asks, “Mom, what is that noise coming from next door?”\n“Don’t bother about it, dear,” says Mrs. Bramachappati. “That young German lady must have a headache.”\nTwenty minutes later, little Muni is woken again. “Hey mom,” she cries. “It sounds like the young German lady is really suffering now!”\n“Just don’t bother about it, dear,” replies her mother. “She must be having a fever – just go to sleep.”\nA few minutes later little Muni is woken again. But this time it is a male voice joining in chorus, yelping and roaring, followed by deep silence.\n“Mom! Mom! Call the doctor!” cries Muni. “What is it?” asks Mrs. Bramachappati.\n“Well,” says Muni, “that poor German girl’s fever has just infected that nice American man from downstairs!”\nKowalski goes to stay in a big hotel in Los Angeles for the first time.\n“I am not going to have this room,” Kowalski complains to the bell-boy. “It is so small I can hardly move in it. It is no better than a pigsty, and I am not going to sleep on that tiny folding bed. Just because I am a Polack, don’t think you can fool me!”\n“Please get in, sir,” says the bell-boy. “This is the elevator!”\nPope the Polack is picked up outside the Vatican on suspicion of rape. He is taken to the police station, finger-printed, booked, and locked in a cell.\nA few hours later, he is placed in a line with five other men. He looks around him with some curiosity. There are several cops, some plainclothesmen, and the rape victim. Seeing her, he leaps out of the line and pointing excitedly shouts, “That is her! That is her!”\nMike, the barman at the Dublin Hotel, is thoroughly fed up with Paddy. Every night, Paddy comes in five minutes before closing time, orders three beers and proceeds to drink them very slowly, forcing Mike to stay late. So Mike has an idea. He has heard about Kowalski working as a gorilla, so he goes and asks him to come to the pub that night.\nKowalski waits in the back room in his gorilla suit, and when Mike has served Paddy his three beers, he goes and tells Kowalski to bang his chest, scream and make as much noise as possible. Hearing such frightening noises from the back room the whole pub clears out immediately, except Paddy, who continues sipping his beer.\nThen Mike says, “Go out there and really scare him!”\nSo Kowalski bursts through the door, roaring, banging his chest and jumping up and down. But still Paddy sips his beer. Then Mike shouts, “Get him, gorilla!”\nKowalski leaps over the bar and jumps on Paddy and they roll out of the door, wrestling. Mike can hear a terrible noise of fighting outside, but when it is over, to Mike’s horror, Paddy walks in. He is covered in blood and hair, and dusting himself off, sits down and says, “My God! Give a Polack a fur coat and he thinks he owns the place!”\nRemember, the first step in meditation is to forget the whole world and just bring out all your craziness in rubbish, gibberish sounds, gestures. But be total because once you are freed of it, then there is a possibility of going deeper into silence than you have ever gone.\nThe second step will be silence. To make it still deeper, the third step will be falling dead so that your whole life energy shrinks at the center of your being, throbbing and giving you the taste a buddha has every moment.\nRupesh, hit the drum for the first step. (Drumbeat)\n(Gibberish) Rupesh... (Drumbeat)\nBe silent, totally silent.\nClose your eyes,\nno movement.\nJust be.\nThis silence, this moment\nis the answer\nto all the questions ever asked. Rupesh, give the third drum. (Drumbeat)\nFall dead.\nTake yourself as deep inwards as possible. Leave the body, leave the mind.\nTake a quantum leap from mind to no-mind.\nNo-mind is your very being.\nRemember all the buddhas\nof the past and future are watching. Deeper and deeper, fearlessly, move into the unknown being\nof your own existence.\nThis is what cannot be said in words. This is where language fails to express.\nThis evening is blessed because you are\nentering into the innermost temple, experiencing the ultimate flowering of your potential.\nRupesh, the drum. (Drumbeat)\nCome back to life, resurrected, new, fresh. Don’t ever look back.\nThe whole existence is now and here.\nOkay, Maneesha?\nYes, Osho.\nCan we celebrate?\nYES!\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2376","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/zen_the_quantum_leap_from_mind_to_nomind/part8/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/zen_the_quantum_leap_from_mind_to_nomind/>Zen.

HEARD IN THE VALLEYS.”</p><p><br></p><p>These offerings to the enlightened ones may be just a few
roseflowers. He is asking whether they are received or not. That is not
an authentic seeker’s question. The question is whether you are offering
or not. Those hands which could receive those flowers are no more
encaged in flesh, in bones. And when you offer your love, your gratitude
will be heard just as the echo of a fisherman’s song pushes the oar and
his voice is heard in the valleys.</p><p><br></p><p>It is difficult to talk about because of the very nature of the
phenomenon. Once you become enlightened, you are no longer – in the old
sense. You are absolutely discontinuous with the old: the jump is
quantum so the old language becomes absolutely inapplicable. All that
can be said is: offerings are made; the whole existence receives them;
no individual hands are going to receive your offerings.</p><p><br></p><p>And the very desire that your offerings should be received is
basically wrong: your offerings should be unconditional. They should be
out of your love, not out of your desire, not out of any demand. It is
just a joy, a dance that a few human beings have disappeared into the
cosmic whole.</p><p><br></p><p>Your offering is simply a symbolic indication that you would also
like to disappear like an echo, slowly, slowly, not leaving any trace
behind; just as a bird flies but does not leave footprints in the
sky.</p><p><br></p><p>BEFORE CHU KOKUSHI DIED, EMPEROR SHUKUSHO ASKED HIM, “WHEN YOU ARE A
HUNDRED YEARS OLD, WHAT SHALL I DO FOR YOU?”</p><p><br></p><p>KOKUSHI ANSWERED, “MAKE A SEAMLESS PAGODA FOR THIS OLD MONK.” THE
EMPEROR SAID, “I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU, WHAT STYLE IS IT TO BE?”</p><p>KOKUSHI REMAINED SILENT FOR A WHILE – this silence was the answer.
But only those who are silent can understand the language of silence.
Only those whose hearts are present in the moment can dance.</p><p>But the emperor could not understand Kokushi and his silence. After a
while he said, “DO YOU UNDERSTAND?”</p><p><br></p><p>“NO, I DO NOT,” SAID THE EMPEROR.</p><p><br></p><p>“I HAVE A DISCIPLE CALLED TANGEN,” SAID KOKUSHI, “WHO HAD THE DHARMA
SEAL TRANSMITTED BY ME. HE IS WELL VERSED IN THIS MATTER. ASK HIM,
PLEASE.”</p><p><br></p><p>The emperor has not understood the master because the master will not
descend from his silence. He sends him to a disciple.</p><p><br></p><p>AFTER KOKUSHI’S DEATH, THE EMPEROR SENT FOR TANGEN AND ASKED HIM
ABOUT IT. TANGEN SAID, “SOUTH OF SHO AND NORTH OF TAN, IN BETWEEN, GOLD
ABOUNDS.”</p><p><br></p><p>Between these two mountains, gold abounds.</p><p><br></p><p>“THE FERRYBOAT UNDER THE SHADOWLESS TREE”... Just see how Zen is more
pictorial than linguistic.</p><p><br></p><p>“THE FERRYBOAT UNDER THE SHADOWLESS TREE, NO HOLY ONE IN THE EMERALD
PALACE YOU SEE.”</p><p><br></p><p>The anecdote ends because the emperor could not see the heart of
silence, the heart of the universal music, the language of the shadows
and the poetry of love. But you should not miss. Do you understand? In
this silence is the whole secret.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 1 Maneesha has asked:</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>WHENEVER I TRY TO DIE EACH NIGHT – TO CLOSE DOWN MY SENSES AND BE
DEAD – I ONLY FEEL LIFE TRYING TO ASSERT ITSELF MORE VIGOROUSLY. AM I
DOING IT WRONGLY OR IS THAT WHAT IS MEANT TO HAPPEN? OR ARE THERE NO
“MEANT TO HAPPENS” HERE?</p><p><br></p><p>Maneesha, it is meant to happen. I am a teacher of life, not of
death; but I can teach you only if you are ready even to die for life.
Already you are so dead, and still you believe through your whole life
that you are alive. But this life is lukewarm. Hence in the meditation I
try to help you, to push you deeper into death because as far as I am
concerned death is a fiction. The whole intention is that as you try to
be more and more dead, you will find life asserting itself.</p><p><br></p><p>It is a very deep dialectical process. The more you try to die, the
more you will find yourself fresh and young and newly born. I teach
resurrection. Jesus should not have the monopoly of being resurrected,
it is everybody’s right. You don’t have to hang on a cross, you can
simply die here. You can just leave the body and go in, fearlessly,
because there is the eternal treasure of being.</p><p>There is no question of losing anything; relax totally so that all
energy moves inwards, gathers inwards, becomes a concentrated
phenomenon. That’s why you are feeling more alive. I want you to be more
alive – alive forever, because that is your nature; only recognition is
needed.</p><p><br></p><p>Meditation is simply a method to recognize the eternity of life and
the fiction of death.</p><p><br></p><p>This silence is so precious that even the bamboos are not making
commentaries today. But I will still give them a little chance to laugh.
Laughter dignifies you because no animal laughs. Laughter proves life
because dead men don’t laugh.</p><p><br></p><p>Little Muni Bramachappati, youngest daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Rama
Bramachappati, a fifteen-year- old child, is suddenly awakened by deep
moaning and groaning coming from the neighbor’s flat in “D” building,
Popular Heights.</p><p><br></p><p>Sleepy-eyed, she goes into her parents’ room and asks, “Mom, what is
that noise coming from next door?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t bother about it, dear,” says Mrs. Bramachappati. “That young
German lady must have a headache.”</p><p><br></p><p>Twenty minutes later, little Muni is woken again. “Hey mom,” she
cries. “It sounds like the young German lady is really suffering
now!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Just don’t bother about it, dear,” replies her mother. “She must be
having a fever – just go to sleep.”</p><p><br></p><p>A few minutes later little Muni is woken again. But this time it is a
male voice joining in chorus, yelping and roaring, followed by deep
silence.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mom! Mom! Call the doctor!” cries Muni. “What is it?” asks Mrs.
Bramachappati.</p><p>“Well,” says Muni, “that poor German girl’s fever has just infected
that nice American man from downstairs!”</p><p><br></p><p>Kowalski goes to stay in a big hotel in Los Angeles for the first
time.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am not going to have this room,” Kowalski complains to the
bell-boy. “It is so small I can hardly move in it. It is no better than
a pigsty, and I am not going to sleep on that tiny folding bed. Just
because I am a Polack, don’t think you can fool me!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Please get in, sir,” says the bell-boy. “This is the elevator!”</p><p><br></p><p>Pope the Polack is picked up outside the Vatican on suspicion of
rape. He is taken to the police station, finger-printed, booked, and
locked in a cell.</p><p><br></p><p>A few hours later, he is placed in a line with five other men. He
looks around him with some curiosity. There are several cops, some
plainclothesmen, and the rape victim. Seeing her, he leaps out of the
line and pointing excitedly shouts, “That is her! That is her!”</p><p>Mike, the barman at the Dublin Hotel, is thoroughly fed up with
Paddy. Every night, Paddy comes in five minutes before closing time,
orders three beers and proceeds to drink them very slowly, forcing Mike
to stay late. So Mike has an idea. He has heard about Kowalski working
as a gorilla, so he goes and asks him to come to the pub that night.</p><p><br></p><p>Kowalski waits in the back room in his gorilla suit, and when Mike
has served Paddy his three beers, he goes and tells Kowalski to bang his
chest, scream and make as much noise as possible. Hearing such
frightening noises from the back room the whole pub clears out
immediately, except Paddy, who continues sipping his beer.</p><p><br></p><p>Then Mike says, “Go out there and really scare him!”</p><p><br></p><p>So Kowalski bursts through the door, roaring, banging his chest and
jumping up and down. But still Paddy sips his beer. Then Mike shouts,
“Get him, gorilla!”</p><p><br></p><p>Kowalski leaps over the bar and jumps on Paddy and they roll out of
the door, wrestling. Mike can hear a terrible noise of fighting outside,
but when it is over, to Mike’s horror, Paddy walks in. He is covered in
blood and hair, and dusting himself off, sits down and says, “My God!
Give a Polack a fur coat and he thinks he owns the place!”</p><p><br></p><p>Remember, the first step in meditation is to forget the whole world
and just bring out all your craziness in rubbish, gibberish sounds,
gestures. But be total because once you are freed of it, then there is a
possibility of going deeper into silence than you have ever gone.</p><p><br></p><p>The second step will be silence. To make it still deeper, the third
step will be falling dead so that your whole life energy shrinks at the
center of your being, throbbing and giving you the taste a buddha has
every moment.</p><p><br></p><p>Rupesh, hit the drum for the first step. (Drumbeat)</p><p>(Gibberish) Rupesh... (Drumbeat)</p><p>Be silent, totally silent.</p><p><br></p><p>Close your eyes,</p><p><br></p><p>no movement.</p><p><br></p><p>Just be.</p><p><br></p><p>This silence, this moment</p><p>is the answer</p><p><br></p><p>to all the questions ever asked. Rupesh, give the third drum.
(Drumbeat)</p><p>Fall dead.</p><p><br></p><p>Take yourself as deep inwards as possible. Leave the body, leave the
mind.</p><p>Take a quantum leap from mind to no-mind.</p><p>No-mind is your very being.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember all the buddhas</p><p><br></p><p>of the past and future are watching. Deeper and deeper, fearlessly,
move into the unknown being</p><p>of your own existence.</p><p><br></p><p>This is what cannot be said in words. This is where language fails to
express.</p><p>This evening is blessed because you are</p><p>entering into the innermost temple, experiencing the ultimate
flowering of your potential.</p><p>Rupesh, the drum. (Drumbeat)</p><p>Come back to life, resurrected, new, fresh. Don’t ever look back.</p><p>The whole existence is now and here.</p><p>Okay, Maneesha?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, Osho.</p><p><br></p><p>Can we celebrate?</p><p><br></p><p>YES!</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part7>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

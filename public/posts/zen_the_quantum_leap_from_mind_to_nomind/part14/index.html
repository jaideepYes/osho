WHEN HE HAD FINISHED LOOKING AT IT, HOGEN SAID, “DID YOU PAINT THIS WITH YOUR HAND OR YOUR MIND?”\nTHE ARTIST ANSWERED, “WITH MY MIND.” HOGEN SAID, “WHAT IS THIS MIND OF YOURS?” THE ARTIST HAD NO ANSWER.\nManeesha, before I discuss the Zen anecdote I have to say a few things to my sannyasins here or anywhere else in the world.\nWrite to the Nobel Prize committee that this old goat, the Shankaracharya of Puri, needs a Nobel Prize. And be quick, otherwise he will commit suicide, though that would not matter, even if the Nobel Prize had to be given posthumously. I have talked about the Shankaracharya, who continuously insists that sati pratha should be legalized and incorporated in the constitution of India.\nNow he has come with a great original idea. For this original idea he needs, deserves a Nobel Prize. In Hyderabad there are no rains this year. He has said that if a woman commits sati, hara-kiri, rains would come. In the whole history of Hinduism there is not a single scripture describing any\nconnection between a woman committing suicide, being burned alive, and the rains coming. For what? To quench the fire of the funeral?\nBut it is strange that in a country which is now bulging with a population of almost one billion, nobody opposes such stupid ideas. It seems nobody is concerned with what happens to man and his future. These priests have exploited man for centuries, have destroyed his dignity. They have been the greatest slave-makers. Half of society consists of women and they have taken all freedom from them, even the freedom to breathe. They want women to commit suicide.\nThis person should be immediately imprisoned. He has to prove on what grounds, for what reason a woman burning alive can bring clouds? And as I have said, he should commit suicide himself to prove it; that would be more manly and more courageous.\nSecondly, just like the women, in this country a great number of people have suffered for centuries; they have been called untouchables. If even their shadow touches you, you have to take a bath. Such insult, such humiliation!\nA new temple is raised, where the untouchables, to whom Gandhi gave that name ‘HARIJANS’, meaning God’s men... clever politics, cunning diplomacy. If these are God’s men, what is everybody else? And these “God’s men” have been suffering for centuries: they are not permitted to read any Hindu scripture or enter any Hindu temple.\nAnd because harijans are trying to enter this temple, suddenly all the Hindu chauvinists, who would not have dared to say anything against the Shankaracharya, are now demanding that he should retire from his post, because he is preventing the harijans from entering the temple.\nMan’s history is full of strange turns. On this point all Hindu scriptures are in favour of the Shankaracharya. If the politicians want to allow harijans into Hindu temples, they should burn all Hindu scriptures. But everybody’s concern is votes. Nobody is concerned with the untouchables, the harijans, or their entry into the temple; the question is, “Should they remain part of Hindu society?” Their number is twenty-five crore, one fourth of Hindu society. Even a man like Mahatma Gandhi was against giving harijans a separate vote, though it could give them a certain independence from centuries of slavery.\nMy own suggestion is that in the first place no harijans should enter any Hindu temple. They should avoid Hindu temples, scriptures, these so-called Shankaracharyas, and should simply declare themselves independent of Hindus. They are enough, twenty-five crore; they can rule over the country! But political parties want them to remain Hindus, because of their voting strength. The politicians are willing even to condemn the Shankaracharya who is right as far as Hindu tradition is concerned. He is perfectly right, because for five thousand years no harijan has ever entered any Hindu temple.\nBut they are suddenly against the Shankaracharya, because he is creating trouble. If these harijans separate themselves from the Hindu fold, the whole destiny of the nation will be different. But they are poor, uneducated, because they have not been allowed any education; they have not been allowed any job other than the ones they have been doing traditionally, the lowest jobs: cleaning people’s toilets, making shoes, butchering animals. They have not been able to move into any other work.\nBut even Mahatma Gandhi was afraid – and I don’t know why people go on calling him Mahatma. The word means ‘the great soul’, but the soul was not very great, it was absolutely political, diplomatic. He fasted for twenty-one days against harijans getting a separate vote. The separate vote was only a symbol that was going to create for harijans a strength of their own. But they don’t have to become anything, they don’t have to become Christians, they don’t have to become Mohammedans, they don’t have to become Buddhists; nobody needs religion, everybody needs individuality, awareness.\nAnd this is a good chance for harijans, but such is foolishness... although for centuries they have been pushed back from the temples and burned alive if found reading the scriptures, they still go on clinging and asking to enter into Hindu temples. There is no need for anybody to enter any temple, any synagogue, any church, any mosque. This whole universe is your temple and your being is the only scripture you have to read.\nI am saying this, because Hindu chauvinists are trying to force harijans to enter the temples, while more orthodox Hindus are trying to prevent them. The whole thing is so stupid! The harijans should simply refuse to enter any Hindu temple or any Mohammedan mosque or any church. You are enough unto yourself. If I don’t need any religion, if I don’t need any temple, if I don’t need any scripture, if I’m sufficient unto myself, why cannot you be?\nBut it seems the slaves are as much responsible for slavery as the slave-makers themselves. The slaves want to be slaves: they want to be dependent. They are afraid, without the priesthood, without the temples, of what would happen to their spiritual growth. I say to everyone: spiritual growth is an individual affair, it needs no organization, it needs no special place, it needs only for you to enter into your own space.\nA NON-BUDDHIST PRESENTED HOGEN WITH A SCREEN THAT HAD A PICTURE PAINTED ON IT. WHEN HE HAD FINISHED LOOKING AT IT, HOGEN SAID, “DID YOU PAINT THIS WITH YOUR HAND OR YOUR MIND?”\nI have to remind you of one thing: Buddhists write ‘mind’ with a small m, when they mean ‘your mind’. And when they want to mean ‘the universal mind’, they write ‘mind’ with a capital M.\nIn this question Hogen has asked about a small-m mind. THE ARTIST ANSWERED, “WITH MY MIND,” – small m. HOGEN SAID, “WHAT IS THIS MIND OF YOURS?”\nTHE ARTIST HAD NO ANSWER.\nPoor artist! A very ordinary artist, who knows nothing of the intricacies and the workings of the mind – what to say about the no-mind? – facing a great master. And if a picture comes from your mind, it is going to be just a reflection of your craziness, insanity. Unless you know the no-mind, unless you know the space beyond mind, your painting, your poetry, your music cannot be sane.\nWe are living on an insane planet. From the second world war to today, without any great war happening, seventeen million people have been killed in small wars, which people hardly notice.\nIs something basically wrong with the mind? It is violent, murderous, suicidal, it gives you misery, suffering, agony, anguish, and still you go on clinging to it.\nThis has to be remembered by my people, that unless your art, your creation comes out of your meditation, it has no value at all. Out of meditation, out of silence, every song becomes Solomon’s song, and every picture represents, as a mirror will represent, a buddha. Before you create anything, uncreate your mind.\nThe artist was really very poor. I want you to be really rich, and there is only one richness which is hidden deep, very deep inside you. It is beyond the reach of your thought, of your reason, it is available only to those who can be utterly silent. Once you have got it, the very kingdom of God is yours. Then whatever comes out of it has a beauty, a blissfulness, an ecstasy.\nBasho wrote:\nTHE BEGINNING OF ALL ART:\nA SONG WHEN PLANTING A RICE-FIELD IN THE COUNTRY’S INMOST PART.\nIt does not matter what you are doing; what matters is: is the inner space silent? Then even planting seeds in a field, you yourself become a song, you yourself become a dance.\nBasho also wrote:\n“... ALL WHO HAVE ACHIEVED REAL EXCELLENCE IN ANY ART, POSSESS ONE THING IN COMMON, THAT IS, A MIND TO OBEY NATURE, TO BE ONE WITH NATURE, THROUGHOUT THE FOUR SEASONS OF THE YEAR. WHATEVER SUCH A MIND SEES IS A FLOWER, AND WHATEVER SUCH A MIND DREAMS OF IS THE MOON. IT IS ONLY A BARBAROUS MIND THAT SEES OTHER THAN THE FLOWER, MERELY AN ANIMAL MIND THAT DREAMS OF OTHER THAN THE MOON.”\nOur so-called mind is almost four million years old. It has passed through very dark nights, when there was no fire, no clothes, no houses; it has lived for millions of years in constant danger. That has made it aggressive, afraid, defensive, always being afraid of the dark night, of the wild animals. The mind carries those four million years of darkness, the fear of death. Hence it is afraid, although the situation has changed. Now there are no wild animals except you. But the mind knows nothing of the present, it carries only the past.\nIf you want to know the universe and its mystery, you have to take a jump out of the mind. Shataku wrote:\nMIND SET FREE IN THE DHARMA-REALM, I SIT AT THE MOON-FILLED WINDOW\nWATCHING THE MOUNTAINS WITH MY EARS, HEARING THE STREAM WITH MY OPEN EYES. EACH MOLECULE PREACHES PERFECT LAW, EACH MOMENT CHANTS TRUE SUTRA:\nTHE MOST FLEETING THOUGHT IS TIMELESS. A SINGLE HAIR IS ENOUGH TO STIR THE SEA.\nAnd Gotsuan wrote:\nWITH NO-MIND I HAVE ENJOYED MY STAY, WITH MIND I RETURN TO SO, MY HOMELAND. WHETHER IN MIND OR NOT,\nI AM CONTENT EN ROUTE TO HEAVEN.\nThese people are talking about things which cannot be said, but out of compassion they are trying to make all kinds of effort to indicate to you your very being, which is your freedom; otherwise, everybody is a prisoner.\nWhen I was imprisoned in America, the sheriff of the jail fell in love with me. He said to me, “Do you feel humiliated, because your hands are cuffed, your feet have chains, your waist has chains, do you feel humiliated?”\nI said, “Everybody is a prisoner, just these handcuffs and these chains don’t make any difference. You are also a prisoner but your chains are invisible.”\nHe was a little puzzled, an old man, but very intelligent. He said, “I don’t understand.”\nI said, “You will have to meditate to see the point that your body is your prison, your mind is nothing but your chains. And I am not humiliated; these handcuffs and these chains that you have put on me simply expose everyone else’s reality. As far as I am concerned, I am free. No chain, no handcuffs, no prison cell can hold me. I can move out, open my wings and be in the eternal – it does not matter.”\nHe was very respectful. He used to come to see me about six times a day and he asked me, “What are you doing all the time? I am the sheriff of seven hundred prisoners here, but you are the strangest, you simply go on sitting.”\nI said, “It is such a rare opportunity not to move, not to do anything, not to have to remember if it is seven o’clock when I go to my people. I have never been so free.”\nHe said, “You are strange, but the whole staff has fallen in love with you.”\nThe moment I left that jail he said, “I know you have to go from here, but deep down none of my staff nor the prisoners want you to leave. Why can’t you stay here? In three days the whole climate of my jail has changed.”\nI said, “I would love to be here, but my people are waiting. Next time, when I decide to have another taste, I will come directly to North Carolina in America.”\nHe said, “You are always welcome, whether you are arrested or not, whether any court wants you to be in the jail or not. As far as I’m concerned, my doors are open.”\nThere is only one freedom, the freedom to be; there is only one life, that which is hidden within you. The moment you touch it, you have moved beyond words, you have heard the celestial song and a dance that continues from eternity to eternity.\nQuestion 1 Maneesha has asked:\nBELOVED OSHO,\nIT FEELS TO ME AS IF THIS DISCOURSE SERIES HAS BEEN MORE LIKE A CLASS IN SCULPTING OR PAINTING, BECAUSE YOU HAVE INVITED US TO HELP CREATE EACH EVENING – TO WEAVE THE SILK OF SILENCE, TO DANCE WITH DEATH AND AWAKE AGAIN, EACH OF US, A MASTER-PIECE.\nManeesha, your question is not a question, but only a statement of the truth.\nBefore we enter this moment, I think a cup of coffee would not be... Sardarji sounds very happy. This time he is sitting nearby. Basically he belongs where the bamboos are, just a turbanned bamboo.\nRonald Reagan takes Margaret Thatcher and Pope the Polack out to lunch. They go to President Reagan’s favorite family restaurant, the ‘Buns and Breasts Chicken House.’\nAfter drinking a little too much wine with lunch, the slightly tipsy trio orders coffee. As it is being served, Ronald Reagan leans over to Margaret Thatcher’s ear. With a devilish grin he slurs, “In America we say ‘Pass the honey, honey.’”\nThe prime minister smiles and bats her eyelashes. Then stroking Pope the Polack’s fingers sensuously, she slurs, “In England we say ‘Pass the sugar, sugar.’” Then she says, “What do you say where you come from, Pope-sy wope-sy?”\nPope the Polack smiles and, straightening his collar, gives Margaret his best Valentino eyes. Then in a low voice he says, “Pass the tea... bag.”\nThe phone rings at the Camp David motorpool and Private Leroy Jackson answers it.\n“Where is that limousine that was ordered half an hour ago?” screams a voice at the other end. “Why is it taking so long?”\n“Oh, you mean the limo for old Colonel Fat-Ass!” replies Leroy. “What did you say?” cries the other voice.\n“Er... who is this calling?” says Leroy, sheepishly.\n“You don’t know? This is Colonel Hawkbutt! And who are you?” demands the Colonel. “You don’t know?” says Leroy. “Well then – bye, bye, Fat-Ass!”\nThe Bishop of Mississippi and his wife are owners of a magnificent parrot. But the parrot is a great embarrassment to the bishop because of its very unreligious language. However, his wife is devoted to the bird and will not get rid of it because of its great intelligence.\nOne day they are playing host to a new black preacher visiting from Chicago. The local people are not happy about having a black man preach in their church, but the bishop is doing everything he can to be polite.\nAfter the services, the bishop and his wife are having coffee and a snack with the preacher in their home.\nThe black man sees the parrot in the corner and is impressed by its beautiful feathers. “Say something to him,” urges the bishop’s wife. “And he will give you a reply.”\nSo the preacher walks over with a little piece of food and says, “Polly wanna cracker?”\nThe parrot eyes the black man suspiciously, and then shrieks, “Nigger wanna watermelon?” Now, Rupesh, give the first beat of the drum and everybody goes absolutely crazy... (Drumbeat)\n(Gibberish) Rupesh... (Drumbeat)\nBe silent. Close your eyes. No movement. Just be in.\nThis is it, your very being, your eternity,\nyour freedom from all limitations.\nThis silent space is what makes you a buddha. In this moment\nI am surrounded by thousands of buddhas. To be a buddha is your birthright.\nThat is the quantum leap, from mind to no-mind.\nMind makes you just an old ancient animal.\nAnd no-mind brings a new universe of ecstasy and blessings;\nthousands of roses blossom in this space.\nNow to make it deeper, Rupesh give the drum a good beat and everybody dies... (Drumbeat)\nDie totally.\nLet the body breathe, don’t bother,\nyou just go on digging deeper and deeper within yourself.\nThere somewhere is the door of the kingdom of God, so close\nthat it is unbelievable how one can forget it. Once you have a taste of it,\nkeep it whatever you do, just as an undercurrent.\nLet this silence remain dancing.\nRupesh... (Drumbeat)\nCome back to life. Be a sitting buddha, but keep the touch and the connection.\nNever for a single moment forget your divineness.\nOkay, Maneesha?\nYes, Osho.\nCan we celebrate the resurrection of so many buddhas? YES!\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2958","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/zen_the_quantum_leap_from_mind_to_nomind/part14/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/zen_the_quantum_leap_from_mind_to_nomind/>Zen.

the untouchables, the harijans, or their entry into the temple; the
question is, “Should they remain part of Hindu society?” Their number is
twenty-five crore, one fourth of Hindu society. Even a man like Mahatma
Gandhi was against giving harijans a separate vote, though it could give
them a certain independence from centuries of slavery.</p><p><br></p><p>My own suggestion is that in the first place no harijans should enter
any Hindu temple. They should avoid Hindu temples, scriptures, these
so-called Shankaracharyas, and should simply declare themselves
independent of Hindus. They are enough, twenty-five crore; they can rule
over the country! But political parties want them to remain Hindus,
because of their voting strength. The politicians are willing even to
condemn the Shankaracharya who is right as far as Hindu tradition is
concerned. He is perfectly right, because for five thousand years no
harijan has ever entered any Hindu temple.</p><p><br></p><p>But they are suddenly against the Shankaracharya, because he is
creating trouble. If these harijans separate themselves from the Hindu
fold, the whole destiny of the nation will be different. But they are
poor, uneducated, because they have not been allowed any education; they
have not been allowed any job other than the ones they have been doing
traditionally, the lowest jobs: cleaning people’s toilets, making shoes,
butchering animals. They have not been able to move into any other
work.</p><p>But even Mahatma Gandhi was afraid – and I don’t know why people go
on calling him Mahatma. The word means ‘the great soul’, but the soul
was not very great, it was absolutely political, diplomatic. He fasted
for twenty-one days against harijans getting a separate vote. The
separate vote was only a symbol that was going to create for harijans a
strength of their own. But they don’t have to become anything, they
don’t have to become Christians, they don’t have to become Mohammedans,
they don’t have to become Buddhists; nobody needs religion, everybody
needs individuality, awareness.</p><p><br></p><p>And this is a good chance for harijans, but such is foolishness...
although for centuries they have been pushed back from the temples and
burned alive if found reading the scriptures, they still go on clinging
and asking to enter into Hindu temples. There is no need for anybody to
enter any temple, any synagogue, any church, any mosque. This whole
universe is your temple and your being is the only scripture you have to
read.</p><p><br></p><p>I am saying this, because Hindu chauvinists are trying to force
harijans to enter the temples, while more orthodox Hindus are trying to
prevent them. The whole thing is so stupid! The harijans should simply
refuse to enter any Hindu temple or any Mohammedan mosque or any church.
You are enough unto yourself. If I don’t need any religion, if I don’t
need any temple, if I don’t need any scripture, if I’m sufficient unto
myself, why cannot you be?</p><p><br></p><p>But it seems the slaves are as much responsible for slavery as the
slave-makers themselves. The slaves want to be slaves: they want to be
dependent. They are afraid, without the priesthood, without the temples,
of what would happen to their spiritual growth. I say to everyone:
spiritual growth is an individual affair, it needs no organization, it
needs no special place, it needs only for you to enter into your own
space.</p><p><br></p><p>A NON-BUDDHIST PRESENTED HOGEN WITH A SCREEN THAT HAD A PICTURE
PAINTED ON IT. WHEN HE HAD FINISHED LOOKING AT IT, HOGEN SAID, “DID YOU
PAINT THIS WITH YOUR HAND OR YOUR MIND?”</p><p><br></p><p>I have to remind you of one thing: Buddhists write ‘mind’ with a
small m, when they mean ‘your mind’. And when they want to mean ‘the
universal mind’, they write ‘mind’ with a capital M.</p><p><br></p><p>In this question Hogen has asked about a small-m mind. THE ARTIST
ANSWERED, “WITH MY MIND,” – small m. HOGEN SAID, “WHAT IS THIS MIND OF
YOURS?”</p><p>THE ARTIST HAD NO ANSWER.</p><p><br></p><p>Poor artist! A very ordinary artist, who knows nothing of the
intricacies and the workings of the mind – what to say about the
no-mind? – facing a great master. And if a picture comes from your mind,
it is going to be just a reflection of your craziness, insanity. Unless
you know the no-mind, unless you know the space beyond mind, your
painting, your poetry, your music cannot be sane.</p><p><br></p><p>We are living on an insane planet. From the second world war to
today, without any great war happening, seventeen million people have
been killed in small wars, which people hardly notice.</p><p>Is something basically wrong with the mind? It is violent, murderous,
suicidal, it gives you misery, suffering, agony, anguish, and still you
go on clinging to it.</p><p><br></p><p>This has to be remembered by my people, that unless your art, your
creation comes out of your meditation, it has no value at all. Out of
meditation, out of silence, every song becomes Solomon’s song, and every
picture represents, as a mirror will represent, a buddha. Before you
create anything, uncreate your mind.</p><p><br></p><p>The artist was really very poor. I want you to be really rich, and
there is only one richness which is hidden deep, very deep inside you.
It is beyond the reach of your thought, of your reason, it is available
only to those who can be utterly silent. Once you have got it, the very
kingdom of God is yours. Then whatever comes out of it has a beauty, a
blissfulness, an ecstasy.</p><p><br></p><p>Basho wrote:</p><p><br></p><p>THE BEGINNING OF ALL ART:</p><p><br></p><p>A SONG WHEN PLANTING A RICE-FIELD IN THE COUNTRY’S INMOST PART.</p><p>It does not matter what you are doing; what matters is: is the inner
space silent? Then even planting seeds in a field, you yourself become a
song, you yourself become a dance.</p><p><br></p><p>Basho also wrote:</p><p><br></p><p>“... ALL WHO HAVE ACHIEVED REAL EXCELLENCE IN ANY ART, POSSESS ONE
THING IN COMMON, THAT IS, A MIND TO OBEY NATURE, TO BE ONE WITH NATURE,
THROUGHOUT THE FOUR SEASONS OF THE YEAR. WHATEVER SUCH A MIND SEES IS A
FLOWER, AND WHATEVER SUCH A MIND DREAMS OF IS THE MOON. IT IS ONLY A
BARBAROUS MIND THAT SEES OTHER THAN THE FLOWER, MERELY AN ANIMAL MIND
THAT DREAMS OF OTHER THAN THE MOON.”</p><p><br></p><p>Our so-called mind is almost four million years old. It has passed
through very dark nights, when there was no fire, no clothes, no houses;
it has lived for millions of years in constant danger. That has made it
aggressive, afraid, defensive, always being afraid of the dark night, of
the wild animals. The mind carries those four million years of darkness,
the fear of death. Hence it is afraid, although the situation has
changed. Now there are no wild animals except you. But the mind knows
nothing of the present, it carries only the past.</p><p><br></p><p>If you want to know the universe and its mystery, you have to take a
jump out of the mind. Shataku wrote:</p><p>MIND SET FREE IN THE DHARMA-REALM, I SIT AT THE MOON-FILLED
WINDOW</p><p>WATCHING THE MOUNTAINS WITH MY EARS, HEARING THE STREAM WITH MY OPEN

of compassion they are trying to make all kinds of effort to indicate to
you your very being, which is your freedom; otherwise, everybody is a
prisoner.</p><p><br></p><p>When I was imprisoned in America, the sheriff of the jail fell in
love with me. He said to me, “Do you feel humiliated, because your hands
are cuffed, your feet have chains, your waist has chains, do you feel
humiliated?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Everybody is a prisoner, just these handcuffs and these
chains don’t make any difference. You are also a prisoner but your
chains are invisible.”</p><p><br></p><p>He was a little puzzled, an old man, but very intelligent. He said,
“I don’t understand.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “You will have to meditate to see the point that your body is
your prison, your mind is nothing but your chains. And I am not
humiliated; these handcuffs and these chains that you have put on me
simply expose everyone else’s reality. As far as I am concerned, I am
free. No chain, no handcuffs, no prison cell can hold me. I can move
out, open my wings and be in the eternal – it does not matter.”</p><p><br></p><p>He was very respectful. He used to come to see me about six times a
day and he asked me, “What are you doing all the time? I am the sheriff
of seven hundred prisoners here, but you are the strangest, you simply
go on sitting.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “It is such a rare opportunity not to move, not to do
anything, not to have to remember if it is seven o’clock when I go to my
people. I have never been so free.”</p><p>He said, “You are strange, but the whole staff has fallen in love
with you.”</p><p><br></p><p>The moment I left that jail he said, “I know you have to go from
here, but deep down none of my staff nor the prisoners want you to
leave. Why can’t you stay here? In three days the whole climate of my
jail has changed.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I would love to be here, but my people are waiting. Next
time, when I decide to have another taste, I will come directly to North
Carolina in America.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “You are always welcome, whether you are arrested or not,
whether any court wants you to be in the jail or not. As far as I’m
concerned, my doors are open.”</p><p><br></p><p>There is only one freedom, the freedom to be; there is only one life,
that which is hidden within you. The moment you touch it, you have moved
beyond words, you have heard the celestial song and a dance that
continues from eternity to eternity.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 1 Maneesha has asked:</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>IT FEELS TO ME AS IF THIS DISCOURSE SERIES HAS BEEN MORE LIKE A CLASS

lunch. They go to President Reagan’s favorite family restaurant, the
‘Buns and Breasts Chicken House.’</p><p><br></p><p>After drinking a little too much wine with lunch, the slightly tipsy
trio orders coffee. As it is being served, Ronald Reagan leans over to
Margaret Thatcher’s ear. With a devilish grin he slurs, “In America we
say ‘Pass the honey, honey.’”</p><p><br></p><p>The prime minister smiles and bats her eyelashes. Then stroking Pope
the Polack’s fingers sensuously, she slurs, “In England we say ‘Pass the
sugar, sugar.’” Then she says, “What do you say where you come from,

its very unreligious language. However, his wife is devoted to the bird
and will not get rid of it because of its great intelligence.</p><p><br></p><p>One day they are playing host to a new black preacher visiting from

beautiful feathers. “Say something to him,” urges the bishop’s wife.
“And he will give you a reply.”</p><p>So the preacher walks over with a little piece of food and says,

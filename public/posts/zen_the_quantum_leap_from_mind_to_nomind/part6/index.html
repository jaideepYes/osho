Gorilla, sir, be a gentleman

BELOVED OSHO,
ON THE OCCASION OF HIS FIRST VISITING RINZAI, KANKEI HAD HARDLY CROSSED THE THRESHOLD, WHEN RINZAI SUDDENLY SEIZED HIM BY THE LAPELS.
KANKEI SAID, “I UNDERSTAND! I UNDERSTAND!”
RINZAI LET GO OF HIM, AND SAID, “FOR THE TIME BEING I’LL OMIT THE TWENTY BLOWS!”

NOW I AM QUITE FULL, AND FEEL NO HUNGER.”\nBASHO TOLD HOW HE FIRST MET WITH THE MASTER, NANTO.\nHE SAID, “WHEN I WAS TWENTY-EIGHT YEARS OLD, I WENT ON A PILGRIMAGE, AND REACHED WHERE NANTO WAS LIVING. ASCENDING THE ROSTRUM, NANTO SAID, ‘ALL YOU PEOPLE, IF YOU ARE ENLIGHTENED, YOU WILL COME OUT OF YOUR MOTHER’S WOMB AND ROAR LIKE A LION. YOU KNOW WHAT THIS ROARING MEANS?’”\nBASHO ADDED, “IMMEDIATELY MY MIND AND BODY WERE RENDERED MOTIONLESS, AND I STOPPED WITH HIM FOR FIVE YEARS.”\nManeesha, before I discuss the anecdote I have to say something about your migraine. As I said yesterday, the moment the beast disappears Maneesha’s migraine will disappear too. I am not a prophet, but Vimal did make a very existential statement, a real, alive, existential anecdote.\nHis being covered in a gorilla coat should not be understood as an individual expression. Everybody is covered with something that is animal. Man has not yet been born! Bodies have changed, but it is your mind that is still struggling in deep forests. You have to be freed from your gorilla coats.\nIn this century an unprecedented one hundred million people have been killed in wars. You call this a sane humanity? And rather than helping sanity, people go on insisting that man should not discover himself.\nJust a few days ago Turiya was in the West and she participated in a new kind of therapy, Fischer- Hoffmann, which is doing immense harm. Ordinarily I don’t speak against stupidities. But this stupid effort of Fischer-Hoffmann therapy has to be demolished completely from its very roots.\nTheir effort is to make your ego stronger, although they don’t say that is what they are doing; they say they are making your individuality independent.\nThey don’t even know the difference between individuality and personality. In the name of individuality they are destroying all possibilities of your spiritual growth. You will be left alone with your ego.\nThey are teaching people... and they are the most expensive therapists now; their training course runs for one year, and they earn millions of dollars by making people free from their mothers, from their fathers, from their wives, from their husbands, from their masters.\nBefore they do any more harm, I appoint Turiya to start here an Anti-Fischer-Hoffmann Therapy group to make it clear that to have your ego does not mean you are free; it simply means you are encaged in your own mind.\nBefore you can be really independent you have to know who you are, who it is beating in your heart; you have to know the universal element, the existential part of your being. Without knowing it, you will be falling again and again into different kinds of bondages. You may be freed from one church, another church will open its door and welcome you. You will be freed from mothers and fathers, then Fischer-Hoffmann will become your father and mother.\nUnless you know that you are alone and enough unto yourself, not borrowed knowledge, but your own EXPERIENCE... The whole effort here is to bring you to a point where freedom blossoms. I am not a fetter to you. Love can never be a fetter, it can never be a prison, and if it is a prison, then it is not love. I know myself; I am sharing with you my delight, my celebration, my arriving home. You are absolutely independent; I am not asking anything from you, just trying to take away that which you are not and consistently forcing on you that which you are.\nThe whole of Western history is ego-centered. They have known nothing about enlightenment. And without enlightenment there is no freedom, no truth, no fearlessness, no dance and no celebration of being. All the therapists here have to help Turiya to create Anti-Fischer-Hoffmann Therapy. And\nI invite the people who are running the therapy in the West to come here and face me. Ego is not freedom.\nEgo is your worst enemy: it is not your strength, it is just a mock-up; it is not you, not even your photograph, not even your shadow.\nI want you to know who is in the innermost being of your interiority. Only that can bring freedom to you. The ego is the last thing to disappear before man can arrive on the earth; otherwise everybody is a gorilla. It does not matter whether you have a gorilla coat or not.\nAnd it was good of Vimal to appear in a gorilla coat, of course unconsciously, not knowing the implications; but he created a migraine in Maneesha. That is very symbolic. Man has been the gorilla all along, creating thousands of migraines in women, all kinds of slaveries and exploitations, preventing their spiritual growth.\nThis place is devoted to absolute freedom, but freedom does not mean license, it means tremendous responsibility. To be is to be responsible: only animals can have licentiousness. To be a man, to have the dignity of being a man means you have accepted the responsibility. You will not blame anything on anyone. Now you always look within for whatever happens to you.\nA survey in Brazil of the primitive people, who have been killed or moved into deep forests around the Amazon, has shown – and this survey was done by professional psychoanalysts – that their methods of curing people’s madness are more effective than our so-called psychology. Their methods are very simple, but are based on something totally different. Their basis is, unless a man’s spirituality is cured, his psychology is going to remain sick. Once your being is cured then mind itself is understood as sickness. You don’t need it. What you need is a clarity which mind is preventing.\nA man can only be a man if he has attained to the state of no-mind, if he has taken the quantum leap we are talking about. It is from animal to man, from mind to no-mind.\nJust today I received information from my sannyasin representative in America that he was interviewed by the press, because they have become worried that I am going to enter the presidential election in America? And there is no law that can prevent me, although everybody knows it is a joke. I cannot fall that low. Twenty percent of American presidents have been murdered, so that is the most stupid place to be. A twenty percent chance of being murdered...! Even men like Abraham Lincoln and Kennedy are no exceptions. The best America has produced it has destroyed.\nJust as a joke I have said, “Yes,” to the Global Promoters, the biggest promoting agency in America, to make it known to everybody in America that I am still alive and kicking. Who cares about being the president of America, I am not that stupid.\nThe press has also asked the Immigration Department, “What do you say, now that Osho is going to enter the presidential election?”\nAnd the chief of the Immigration Department said, “This is possible only if God wants it.”\nIt is good to know that the Immigration Department of America will at least not prevent God from coming into America. And also it seems that the American Immigration Department – which fought\nme for five years and had not the guts even to arrest me – seems to be a very faithful, religious, God-loving company. These are the people who have killed God also, because anybody who is preparing to destroy this planet – and America is number one...\nIt is so hilarious that on the one hand they go on saying they believe that God created the world, and now Ronald Reagan is going to destroy it. Is this what fundamentalist Christianity means? In a way it is very symbolic. God is killed by the priests, God is killed by the believers. God is known only by the meditators, not as a separate entity hiding somewhere millions of light-years away, but someone breathing within your heart. Only a meditator becomes a temple of God, only a meditator becomes an answer to all kinds of atheistic suspicions.\nI was amazed also to receive today another piece of research, done by American psychoanalysts in China. Up to now psychoanalysts have believed that possessiveness is biological, it is instinctive. But they were surprised to discover that Chinese children are not as possessive as American children. Chinese children share more than American children, are less aggressive than American children. They had to change their whole idea and for the first time accept that possessiveness and aggression are not biological but cultural, educational, social.\nThat’s what I have been telling you, that whatever is wrong in you has not come from nature, but is part of your social and cultural heritage. Unless you become totally free from culture, so-called civilization, and show the strength of being alone, man will never arrive on this planet.\nVimal’s existential statement is worth appreciating. He did it well, without knowing that he was exposing everybody else too. You all have to look deep down and drop your gorilla coats. Find out the diamond of your being, inside.\nGautam Buddha even had a series of lectures, called the Diamond Sutra, to discover the diamond within you. Nobody can give it to you, you already have it; only, you have to be shaken awake.\nON THE OCCASION OF HIS FIRST VISITING RINZAI, KANKEI HAD HARDLY CROSSED THE THRESHOLD, WHEN RINZAI SUDDENLY SEIZED HIM BY THE LAPELS.\nKANKEI SAID, “I UNDERSTAND! I UNDERSTAND!”\nRINZAI LET GO OF HIM, AND SAID, “FOR THE TIME BEING I WILL OMIT THE TWENTY BLOWS!”\nRinzai was one of the loveliest masters in the history of Zen. He brought Zen from China to Japan, but he had lived with Chinese masters. He carried the same flame Bodhidharma took from India to China. He had something of the same greatness, beauty, and the absurd approach to awaken you. Anything rational your mind absorbs, and goes on sleeping: something absurd which the mind cannot make any sense of is absolutely needed to cut the mind in a single blow.\nON THE OCCASION OF HIS FIRST VISITING RINZAI, KANKEI HAD HARDLY CROSSED THE THRESHOLD, WHEN RINZAI SUDDENLY SEIZED HIM BY THE LAPELS. KANKEI immediately SAID, “I UNDERSTAND! I UNDERSTAND!”\nHe knew that this man had been beating people to wake them up. He had been known to throw people from windows out of his room, jump upon them and ask them, “Do you understand?”\nNothing was impossible for this man. Out of fear, KANKEI SAID, “I UNDERSTAND! I UNDERSTAND! Just don’t start... this is enough!”\nRINZAI LET GO OF HIM, AND SAID, “FOR THE TIME BEING I WILL OMIT THE TWENTY BLOWS!”\nYou require to be beaten at least twenty times. But for the time being I will leave it, you are not ripe enough. You are so fearful that I have not said anything and you start shouting, ‘I understand!’. You have not even crossed the threshold. You are not worthy to have a taste of my stick. “FOR THE TIME BEING, I WILL OMIT THE TWENTY BLOWS.” Be ripe, be yourself, be worthy of a master’s reward. And the master can reward you in only one way: by waking you up. Whatsoever means he has to adopt are arbitrary.\nKANKEI LIVED WITH RINZAI FROM THAT TIME ON, AND AFTERWARDS USED TO SAY, “WHEN I SAW RINZAI, THERE WAS NO TALKING OR EXPLANATION. NOW I AM QUITE FULL, AND FEEL NO HUNGER.”\nSix years he lived with Rinzai. Not a single word passed from Rinzai’s lips towards Kankei. Silence was the only communication. But in six years’ time, Kankei was able to say, “WHEN I SAW RINZAI, THERE WAS NO TALKING OR EXPLANATION. NOW I AM QUITE FULL, AND FEEL NO HUNGER.”\nA master, just by his presence, can also awaken you. It all depends on you. If your longing to be awake in this sleeping world is total, then this very moment you will find yourself full, without any hunger.\nBASHO TOLD HOW HE FIRST MET WITH THE MASTER, NANTO.\nHE SAID, “WHEN I WAS TWENTY-EIGHT YEARS OLD, I WENT ON A PILGRIMAGE, AND REACHED WHERE NANTO WAS LIVING. ASCENDING THE ROSTRUM, NANTO SAID, ‘ALL YOU PEOPLE, IF YOU ARE ENLIGHTENED, YOU WILL COME OUT OF YOUR MOTHER’S WOMB AND ROAR LIKE A LION. YOU KNOW WHAT THIS ROARING MEANS?’”\nBASHO ADDED, “IMMEDIATELY MY MIND AND BODY WERE RENDERED MOTIONLESS, AND I STOPPED WITH HIM FOR FIVE YEARS.”\nJust the way he said ‘roaring’, just the way he was, his presence, his heartbeat; and Basho lived with him for five years without a single word passing between the master and the disciple.\nAnd Basho became one of the greatest masters in his own right. He deserved it. Every man of silence, of love, of no-mind is a born master. Whether he has disciples or not does not matter. The master can be alone and yet be the master. His being a master does not depend on followers, on disciples, but on his own awareness.\nTuriya, this has to be the basic philosophy for the Anti-Hoff-Fischerman. I call it Hoff-Fischerman because to say Hoffmann is not right. Man cannot be ‘half’, even in Germany. Either man is total, full or he is absent.\nYou have to work out, Turiya, in detail the process by which the ego is destroyed without destroying the individuality. Individuality has to be sharpened, freedom has to be made more and more fragrant. Everybody has to be given wings and the whole sky as their territory, unlimited.\nQuestion 1\nManeesha has asked a question:\nBELOVED OSHO,\nOH DEAR! A LION NOW! HE SLIPPED IN AFTER ANOTHER SUTRA HAD ALREADY BEEN SELECTED AND INSISTED ON BEING INCLUDED, SAYING YOU WOULD UNDERSTAND. SORRY, BUT WHAT TO DO. I AM AFRAID THE WORD HAS SPREAD.\nDon’t be worried,\nSutra or no sutra, I am here to hit you awake. This sutra or another sutra... these are just arbitrary means. I will use every possible means to destroy your unconsciousness and sleep. I want thousands of flames around me, dancing in a festival of lights.\nBefore you start your meditation, a few cold drinks will be good.\nOld man Finkelstein manages to get a date with his secretary, Miss Willing, but is worried about his aging equipment. So he goes to see Dr. Bones and asks for something to restore his youthful vigor. Bones gives him two pills and says, “Take these with your dinner tonight and you will be able to perform like a bull.”\nSo Fink and Miss Willing go to the best restaurant in town and when they have ordered their soup, Fink calls the waiter and says, “Put these pills into my soup before you serve it.”\nThe waiter disappears. They wait for half an hour and still the soup has not been served, so Fink angrily calls the waiter and says, “What the hell has happened to our soup?”\n“I am sorry, sir,” replies the waiter, “but I put the pills into your soup and now I am waiting for the noodles to lie down again.”\nEvery time Tex rides his horse through the Indian village, he waves cheerfully at the old chief. In reply, the old chief holds up his hand with his middle finger pointing upwards. Then he turns his hands so that his finger points horizontally.\nTex gets curious to know what the old chief is trying to communicate to him. So, one day, he gets off his horse in the Indian village and goes to the chief’s tent. “I know what it means,” says Tex, “when you wave at me with the finger straight up. But what does it mean when you turn your finger sideways?”\n“It means,” says the old chief, “that I don’t like your horse, either!”\nFather O’Leary goes to a farm in order to buy a horse. He sees a beautiful one that he likes and asks if he can try it.\n“Sure,” says the farmer, “but I have to tell you something. That horse used to belong to the bishop, and if you want the horse to move, you have to say, ‘My God!’ and if you want him to stop, you have to say, ‘Hallelujia’.”\n“That’s okay,” says the priest and jumps up on the horse and says, “My God!” The horse promptly moves off and Father O’Leary is seen galloping into the mountains.\nThe priest is shouting, “My God! My God!” and the horse is really moving. But suddenly, Father O’Leary sees that they are coming to the edge of a cliff and in panic he yells, “Stop! Stop!” but the horse keeps on going. Then he remembers and shouts, “Hallelujia!”\nThe horse stops, right on the edge of the cliff, and, looking down, Father O’Leary says, “My God!” Rupesh...\nI am going to watch that nobody remains silent. You are so full of gibberish. Throw it out! First clean the ground, then silence descends on its own.\nRupesh, give the first beat. (Drumbeat)\n(Gibberish) Rupesh... (Drumbeat)\nBe silent. Gather yourself inwards. Close your eyes.\nNo movement. Just be. Beautiful is the moment and blessed you are.\nRupesh... (Drumbeat)\nFall dead. Let the body breathe but you go on, in and in. This is the door from animal to man,\nfrom mind to no-mind, the quantum leap.\nFearlessly enter into your interiority.\nThis is you.\nFeel it, rejoice in it.\nThis moment contains eternity. Rupesh...\n(Drumbeat)\nBring everybody back to life. One more beat.\n(Drumbeat)\nCome back to life, alive, fresh, soaked in your own consciousness, cleansed by no-mind,\nhaving touched eternity and tasted immortality which is your basic right, your birthright.\nOkay, Maneesha?\nYes, Osho.\nCan we celebrate now?\nYES!\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"3068","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/zen_the_quantum_leap_from_mind_to_nomind/part6/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/zen_the_quantum_leap_from_mind_to_nomind/>Zen.

did make a very existential statement, a real, alive, existential
anecdote.</p><p><br></p><p>His being covered in a gorilla coat should not be understood as an
individual expression. Everybody is covered with something that is
animal. Man has not yet been born! Bodies have changed, but it is your
mind that is still struggling in deep forests. You have to be freed from
your gorilla coats.</p><p><br></p><p>In this century an unprecedented one hundred million people have been
killed in wars. You call this a sane humanity? And rather than helping
sanity, people go on insisting that man should not discover himself.</p><p><br></p><p>Just a few days ago Turiya was in the West and she participated in a
new kind of therapy, Fischer- Hoffmann, which is doing immense harm.
Ordinarily I don’t speak against stupidities. But this stupid effort of
Fischer-Hoffmann therapy has to be demolished completely from its very
roots.</p><p><br></p><p>Their effort is to make your ego stronger, although they don’t say
that is what they are doing; they say they are making your individuality
independent.</p><p><br></p><p>They don’t even know the difference between individuality and
personality. In the name of individuality they are destroying all
possibilities of your spiritual growth. You will be left alone with your
ego.</p><p><br></p><p>They are teaching people... and they are the most expensive
therapists now; their training course runs for one year, and they earn
millions of dollars by making people free from their mothers, from their
fathers, from their wives, from their husbands, from their masters.</p><p><br></p><p>Before they do any more harm, I appoint Turiya to start here an
Anti-Fischer-Hoffmann Therapy group to make it clear that to have your
ego does not mean you are free; it simply means you are encaged in your
own mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Before you can be really independent you have to know who you are,
who it is beating in your heart; you have to know the universal element,
the existential part of your being. Without knowing it, you will be
falling again and again into different kinds of bondages. You may be
freed from one church, another church will open its door and welcome
you. You will be freed from mothers and fathers, then Fischer-Hoffmann
will become your father and mother.</p><p><br></p><p>Unless you know that you are alone and enough unto yourself, not
borrowed knowledge, but your own EXPERIENCE... The whole effort here is
to bring you to a point where freedom blossoms. I am not a fetter to
you. Love can never be a fetter, it can never be a prison, and if it is
a prison, then it is not love. I know myself; I am sharing with you my
delight, my celebration, my arriving home. You are absolutely
independent; I am not asking anything from you, just trying to take away
that which you are not and consistently forcing on you that which you
are.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole of Western history is ego-centered. They have known nothing
about enlightenment. And without enlightenment there is no freedom, no
truth, no fearlessness, no dance and no celebration of being. All the
therapists here have to help Turiya to create Anti-Fischer-Hoffmann
Therapy. And</p><p>I invite the people who are running the therapy in the West to come
here and face me. Ego is not freedom.</p><p><br></p><p>Ego is your worst enemy: it is not your strength, it is just a
mock-up; it is not you, not even your photograph, not even your
shadow.</p><p><br></p><p>I want you to know who is in the innermost being of your interiority.
Only that can bring freedom to you. The ego is the last thing to
disappear before man can arrive on the earth; otherwise everybody is a
gorilla. It does not matter whether you have a gorilla coat or not.</p><p><br></p><p>And it was good of Vimal to appear in a gorilla coat, of course
unconsciously, not knowing the implications; but he created a migraine
in Maneesha. That is very symbolic. Man has been the gorilla all along,
creating thousands of migraines in women, all kinds of slaveries and
exploitations, preventing their spiritual growth.</p><p><br></p><p>This place is devoted to absolute freedom, but freedom does not mean
license, it means tremendous responsibility. To be is to be responsible:
only animals can have licentiousness. To be a man, to have the dignity
of being a man means you have accepted the responsibility. You will not
blame anything on anyone. Now you always look within for whatever
happens to you.</p><p><br></p><p>A survey in Brazil of the primitive people, who have been killed or
moved into deep forests around the Amazon, has shown – and this survey
was done by professional psychoanalysts – that their methods of curing
people’s madness are more effective than our so-called psychology. Their
methods are very simple, but are based on something totally different.
Their basis is, unless a man’s spirituality is cured, his psychology is
going to remain sick. Once your being is cured then mind itself is
understood as sickness. You don’t need it. What you need is a clarity
which mind is preventing.</p><p><br></p><p>A man can only be a man if he has attained to the state of no-mind,
if he has taken the quantum leap we are talking about. It is from animal
to man, from mind to no-mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Just today I received information from my sannyasin representative in
America that he was interviewed by the press, because they have become
worried that I am going to enter the presidential election in America?
And there is no law that can prevent me, although everybody knows it is
a joke. I cannot fall that low. Twenty percent of American presidents
have been murdered, so that is the most stupid place to be. A twenty
percent chance of being murdered...! Even men like Abraham Lincoln and
Kennedy are no exceptions. The best America has produced it has
destroyed.</p><p><br></p><p>Just as a joke I have said, “Yes,” to the Global Promoters, the
biggest promoting agency in America, to make it known to everybody in
America that I am still alive and kicking. Who cares about being the
president of America, I am not that stupid.</p><p><br></p><p>The press has also asked the Immigration Department, “What do you
say, now that Osho is going to enter the presidential election?”</p><p><br></p><p>And the chief of the Immigration Department said, “This is possible
only if God wants it.”</p><p><br></p><p>It is good to know that the Immigration Department of America will at
least not prevent God from coming into America. And also it seems that
the American Immigration Department – which fought</p><p>me for five years and had not the guts even to arrest me – seems to
be a very faithful, religious, God-loving company. These are the people
who have killed God also, because anybody who is preparing to destroy
this planet – and America is number one...</p><p><br></p><p>It is so hilarious that on the one hand they go on saying they
believe that God created the world, and now Ronald Reagan is going to
destroy it. Is this what fundamentalist Christianity means? In a way it
is very symbolic. God is killed by the priests, God is killed by the
believers. God is known only by the meditators, not as a separate entity
hiding somewhere millions of light-years away, but someone breathing
within your heart. Only a meditator becomes a temple of God, only a
meditator becomes an answer to all kinds of atheistic suspicions.</p><p><br></p><p>I was amazed also to receive today another piece of research, done by
American psychoanalysts in China. Up to now psychoanalysts have believed
that possessiveness is biological, it is instinctive. But they were
surprised to discover that Chinese children are not as possessive as
American children. Chinese children share more than American children,
are less aggressive than American children. They had to change their
whole idea and for the first time accept that possessiveness and
aggression are not biological but cultural, educational, social.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what I have been telling you, that whatever is wrong in you
has not come from nature, but is part of your social and cultural
heritage. Unless you become totally free from culture, so-called
civilization, and show the strength of being alone, man will never
arrive on this planet.</p><p><br></p><p>Vimal’s existential statement is worth appreciating. He did it well,
without knowing that he was exposing everybody else too. You all have to
look deep down and drop your gorilla coats. Find out the diamond of your
being, inside.</p><p><br></p><p>Gautam Buddha even had a series of lectures, called the Diamond
Sutra, to discover the diamond within you. Nobody can give it to you,
you already have it; only, you have to be shaken awake.</p><p><br></p><p>ON THE OCCASION OF HIS FIRST VISITING RINZAI, KANKEI HAD HARDLY
CROSSED THE THRESHOLD, WHEN RINZAI SUDDENLY SEIZED HIM BY THE
LAPELS.</p><p><br></p><p>KANKEI SAID, “I UNDERSTAND! I UNDERSTAND!”</p><p><br></p><p>RINZAI LET GO OF HIM, AND SAID, “FOR THE TIME BEING I WILL OMIT THE
TWENTY BLOWS!”</p><p><br></p><p>Rinzai was one of the loveliest masters in the history of Zen. He
brought Zen from China to Japan, but he had lived with Chinese masters.
He carried the same flame Bodhidharma took from India to China. He had
something of the same greatness, beauty, and the absurd approach to
awaken you. Anything rational your mind absorbs, and goes on sleeping:
something absurd which the mind cannot make any sense of is absolutely
needed to cut the mind in a single blow.</p><p><br></p><p>ON THE OCCASION OF HIS FIRST VISITING RINZAI, KANKEI HAD HARDLY
CROSSED THE THRESHOLD, WHEN RINZAI SUDDENLY SEIZED HIM BY THE LAPELS.
KANKEI immediately SAID, “I UNDERSTAND! I UNDERSTAND!”</p><p><br></p><p>He knew that this man had been beating people to wake them up. He had
been known to throw people from windows out of his room, jump upon them
and ask them, “Do you understand?”</p><p>Nothing was impossible for this man. Out of fear, KANKEI SAID, “I
UNDERSTAND! I UNDERSTAND! Just don’t start... this is enough!”</p><p>RINZAI LET GO OF HIM, AND SAID, “FOR THE TIME BEING I WILL OMIT THE
TWENTY BLOWS!”</p><p>You require to be beaten at least twenty times. But for the time
being I will leave it, you are not ripe enough. You are so fearful that
I have not said anything and you start shouting, ‘I understand!’. You
have not even crossed the threshold. You are not worthy to have a taste
of my stick. “FOR THE TIME BEING, I WILL OMIT THE TWENTY BLOWS.” Be
ripe, be yourself, be worthy of a master’s reward. And the master can
reward you in only one way: by waking you up. Whatsoever means he has to
adopt are arbitrary.</p><p>KANKEI LIVED WITH RINZAI FROM THAT TIME ON, AND AFTERWARDS USED TO
SAY, “WHEN I SAW RINZAI, THERE WAS NO TALKING OR EXPLANATION. NOW I AM
QUITE FULL, AND FEEL NO HUNGER.”</p><p>Six years he lived with Rinzai. Not a single word passed from
Rinzai’s lips towards Kankei. Silence was the only communication. But in
six years’ time, Kankei was able to say, “WHEN I SAW RINZAI, THERE WAS
NO TALKING OR EXPLANATION. NOW I AM QUITE FULL, AND FEEL NO HUNGER.”</p><p>A master, just by his presence, can also awaken you. It all depends
on you. If your longing to be awake in this sleeping world is total,
then this very moment you will find yourself full, without any
hunger.</p><p>BASHO TOLD HOW HE FIRST MET WITH THE MASTER, NANTO.</p><p><br></p><p>HE SAID, “WHEN I WAS TWENTY-EIGHT YEARS OLD, I WENT ON A PILGRIMAGE,
AND REACHED WHERE NANTO WAS LIVING. ASCENDING THE ROSTRUM, NANTO SAID,
‘ALL YOU PEOPLE, IF YOU ARE ENLIGHTENED, YOU WILL COME OUT OF YOUR
MOTHER’S WOMB AND ROAR LIKE A LION. YOU KNOW WHAT THIS ROARING
MEANS?’”</p><p>BASHO ADDED, “IMMEDIATELY MY MIND AND BODY WERE RENDERED MOTIONLESS,
AND I STOPPED WITH HIM FOR FIVE YEARS.”</p><p>Just the way he said ‘roaring’, just the way he was, his presence,
his heartbeat; and Basho lived with him for five years without a single
word passing between the master and the disciple.</p><p>And Basho became one of the greatest masters in his own right. He
deserved it. Every man of silence, of love, of no-mind is a born master.
Whether he has disciples or not does not matter. The master can be alone
and yet be the master. His being a master does not depend on followers,
on disciples, but on his own awareness.</p><p>Turiya, this has to be the basic philosophy for the
Anti-Hoff-Fischerman. I call it Hoff-Fischerman because to say Hoffmann
is not right. Man cannot be ‘half’, even in Germany. Either man is
total, full or he is absent.</p><p>You have to work out, Turiya, in detail the process by which the ego
is destroyed without destroying the individuality. Individuality has to
be sharpened, freedom has to be made more and more fragrant. Everybody
has to be given wings and the whole sky as their territory,
unlimited.</p><p>Question 1</p><p><br></p><p>Maneesha has asked a question:</p><p><br></p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>OH DEAR! A LION NOW! HE SLIPPED IN AFTER ANOTHER SUTRA HAD ALREADY
BEEN SELECTED AND INSISTED ON BEING INCLUDED, SAYING YOU WOULD
UNDERSTAND. SORRY, BUT WHAT TO DO. I AM AFRAID THE WORD HAS SPREAD.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t be worried,</p><p><br></p><p>Sutra or no sutra, I am here to hit you awake. This sutra or another
sutra... these are just arbitrary means. I will use every possible means
to destroy your unconsciousness and sleep. I want thousands of flames
around me, dancing in a festival of lights.</p><p><br></p><p>Before you start your meditation, a few cold drinks will be good.</p><p><br></p><p>Old man Finkelstein manages to get a date with his secretary, Miss
Willing, but is worried about his aging equipment. So he goes to see Dr.
Bones and asks for something to restore his youthful vigor. Bones gives
him two pills and says, “Take these with your dinner tonight and you
will be able to perform like a bull.”</p><p><br></p><p>So Fink and Miss Willing go to the best restaurant in town and when
they have ordered their soup, Fink calls the waiter and says, “Put these
pills into my soup before you serve it.”</p><p><br></p><p>The waiter disappears. They wait for half an hour and still the soup
has not been served, so Fink angrily calls the waiter and says, “What
the hell has happened to our soup?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am sorry, sir,” replies the waiter, “but I put the pills into your
soup and now I am waiting for the noodles to lie down again.”</p><p><br></p><p>Every time Tex rides his horse through the Indian village, he waves
cheerfully at the old chief. In reply, the old chief holds up his hand
with his middle finger pointing upwards. Then he turns his hands so that
his finger points horizontally.</p><p><br></p><p>Tex gets curious to know what the old chief is trying to communicate
to him. So, one day, he gets off his horse in the Indian village and
goes to the chief’s tent. “I know what it means,” says Tex, “when you
wave at me with the finger straight up. But what does it mean when you
turn your finger sideways?”</p><p><br></p><p>“It means,” says the old chief, “that I don’t like your horse,
either!”</p><p><br></p><p>Father O’Leary goes to a farm in order to buy a horse. He sees a
beautiful one that he likes and asks if he can try it.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sure,” says the farmer, “but I have to tell you something. That
horse used to belong to the bishop, and if you want the horse to move,
you have to say, ‘My God!’ and if you want him to stop, you have to say,
‘Hallelujia’.”</p><p>“That’s okay,” says the priest and jumps up on the horse and says,
“My God!” The horse promptly moves off and Father O’Leary is seen
galloping into the mountains.</p><p><br></p><p>The priest is shouting, “My God! My God!” and the horse is really
moving. But suddenly, Father O’Leary sees that they are coming to the
edge of a cliff and in panic he yells, “Stop! Stop!” but the horse keeps
on going. Then he remembers and shouts, “Hallelujia!”</p><p><br></p><p>The horse stops, right on the edge of the cliff, and, looking down,
Father O’Leary says, “My God!” Rupesh...</p><p>I am going to watch that nobody remains silent. You are so full of
gibberish. Throw it out! First clean the ground, then silence descends
on its own.</p><p><br></p><p>Rupesh, give the first beat. (Drumbeat)</p><p>(Gibberish) Rupesh... (Drumbeat)</p><p>Be silent. Gather yourself inwards. Close your eyes.</p><p>No movement. Just be. Beautiful is the moment and blessed you
are.</p><p>Rupesh... (Drumbeat)</p><p>Fall dead. Let the body breathe but you go on, in and in. This is the
door from animal to man,</p><p>from mind to no-mind, the quantum leap.</p><p>Fearlessly enter into your interiority.</p><p>This is you.</p><p><br></p><p>Feel it, rejoice in it.</p><p><br></p><p>This moment contains eternity. Rupesh...</p><p>(Drumbeat)</p><p><br></p><p>Bring everybody back to life. One more beat.</p><p>(Drumbeat)</p><p><br></p><p>Come back to life, alive, fresh, soaked in your own consciousness,
cleansed by no-mind,</p><p>having touched eternity and tasted immortality which is your basic
right, your birthright.</p><p>Okay, Maneesha?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, Osho.</p><p><br></p><p>Can we celebrate now?</p><p><br></p><p>YES!</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part5>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

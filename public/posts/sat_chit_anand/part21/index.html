THERE MUST BE, BECAUSE YOU ARE SUCH A LAUGHTER; OR IS YOUR LAUGHTER JUST FOR US?\nDevageet, the cosmos is full of laughter, but a laughter that is very silent, a laughter that you can feel but cannot hear, a laughter that spreads all over your being. You can feel the lightness and the benediction that it brings to you, but there is no way to hear it, and there is no way to compare it to the laughter we are aware of.\nIt was for this reason that all the ancient awakened ones have not talked about laughter. The danger was that you may think the laughter that you know is the laughter of the ultimate. The difference is very great. Our laughter is simply ripples on the surface of the lake. The cosmic laughter of sachchidanand is the whole lake, but without ripples – utterly silent and serene, still, just like a sweetness, joyfulness, very delicate, very subtle. The ancient awakened ones never mentioned it, just as they have never mentioned many other things out of a certain fear of misunderstanding.\nThey have not mentioned that there is an orgasmic joy in the experience of enlightenment. It is sheer fear that the moment they use the word ‘orgasmic’ you will think about sexual orgasm. It is not sexual, it is nonsexual. But as far as the orgasmic experience of utter relaxedness, of absolute stoppage of time and mind is concerned, it is the same.\nI have dared to walk on paths untrodden by the ancient awakened ones because my feeling is that the fear of misunderstanding should not prevent one from saying the truth. And if one is too afraid of being misunderstood, then there is nothing to say, because everything is going to be misunderstood. You talk about truth and it will be understood as a fact. You talk about consciousness, and people will think, of course, that they are conscious. Maybe it will be a bigger consciousness, but there is not going to be any qualitative change. Yet there is going to be a qualitative change.\nIn fact every quantitative change at a certain point turns into a qualitative change. You heat water. Up to ninety-nine degrees it is water. The moment it reaches a hundred degrees a transformation happens. Water starts disappearing into vapor. This is a qualitative change. You can quench your thirst with the water, but not with the vapor.\nWater always goes downwards, it moves towards the sea, which is the lowest level. Vapor goes upwards: it creates the clouds. Their paths are different, their qualities are different. Water is visible, vapor soon becomes invisible.\nOr, from the other side, at a certain point water can become ice. The qualities are different. Water is continuously flowing, ice has lost that flow. It is static, it has become almost like a stone.\nQuantity at a certain point brings a new quality. Out of fear of being misunderstood, many things have not been said to humanity. Not that they were not known to those who have come to the highest peak, but they have chosen to speak only of certain aspects. Even those certain aspects are misunderstood. And many they have left unsaid. They know that when you reach, you will experience.\nI don’t want to leave anything unsaid. I don’t function out of fear at all. And I trust my people’s intelligence more than any awakened person has ever trusted.\nMahavira never allowed his male and female sannyasins to be together – a fear that they might fall back into their old habits. He arranged that the women sannyasins should remain separate from the men sannyasins. If you go into details you can see the fear. The women sannyasins should always bow down to the men sannyasins, even if the male sannyasin may be just one day old. He may have taken sannyas just one day before, still a sixty-year-old woman sannyasin has to bow down to this young person. She has been a sannyasin for sixty years. The reason? The reason is that whenever a woman bows down to a man there is a protection. She is paying so much respect to you, you cannot behave in any disrespectful way towards her. And according to Mahavira, even to think about sex will be disrespectful.\nBut all these details have a hidden psychology of fear. All male sannyasins and women sannyasins had to move in a group of five; nobody was allowed to move alone. Why? Lions move alone because they are unafraid. What is the fear? Why should five men move together? So they can keep an eye on each other, that nobody falls below the discipline, that nobody does things which are not allowed.\nFive women moving together will keep alert about each other, will see that nobody falls in love, nobody becomes too much attached to anyone. Mahavira has put four against one. Their jealousy, their competitiveness, and their very nature of putting the other down will keep them alert. But this is functioning out of fear.\nAnd I know Mahavira was not afraid as far as he himself was concerned. He was afraid about his disciples. That means he was not as respectful to the disciples and their intelligence as he should have been. My feeling is, if I am not respectful towards you and I cannot trust you, then no arrangement is going to help. And all these people in the past ... although they thought of every detail, there were always loopholes. Sannyasins have been finding ways for perverted sex.\nGautam Buddha was afraid even to initiate women in his commune as sannyasins. He remained very stubborn. But that was out of a certain fear that if women entered in the commune ... He did not believe in his own sannyasins. He knew that they would start falling back into their biological heritage.\nHence many things have not been said and many disciplines have been created which ultimately turn into fetters. And all these people were trying to help you to attain ultimate freedom. But if you want freedom, then you have to start with freedom. If you start with bondage, you cannot end with freedom. Freedom has to be the first if you want freedom to be the last, because it is a growth. They fettered their people so tightly. In Buddhism there are thirty-three thousand rules of discipline. Now, you have put almost the whole Himalayas on the chests of your sannyasins. They are small things\n...\nA sannyasin is going to preach in faraway places where Buddha cannot go, because he is too old. Before he leaves, Buddha says, “Remember a few things. Don’t talk to a woman.”\nThe young sannyasin must have been a man of tremendous courage. He said, “Generally, you are right. There is no need for me to talk to any woman. But there is a possibility ... at least one percent you should keep open. Ninety-nine percent of the time I will not talk, but there can be a situation in which talking becomes absolutely necessary. If I am standing on a crossroad and I don’t know where to go, where the village is, and a woman comes by, should I ask her or not? Or should I remain stuck on the crossroad? Or a woman falls into a ditch and I am passing by, should I ask her if I can help?”\nBuddha was silent. Then he said, “Okay, for one percent you are allowed. Remember, that is only in emergency situations. But never touch a woman.” The man was again raising the same question. “There can be a situation when you have to touch a woman. A woman falls on the road, maybe sunstroke, maybe epilepsy, maybe some kind of coma ... Do you want me not to touch her? There are emergency situations when it will be very uncompassionate not to touch the woman. And I think compassion is the foundation of your philosophy.”\nVery reluctantly Buddha said, “Okay, in emergency situations you can touch a woman, but remember one thing, whenever you are close to a woman, speaking to her or touching her, be very alert. Don’t get back to your old habits, which are tremendously powerful, because they belong to your whole past of millions of years.”\nBut that one percent emergency becomes the loophole. Who is going to decide what is emergency and what is not? So all the rules, thirty-three thousand in all, have their loopholes. You cannot have a foolproof system. Human beings are human beings.\nMy approach is totally different. My approach is to bring men and women so close together that there is no need to keep arbitrary disciplines. Just their very closeness, slowly, slowly, will make\nthem drop their differences. Their closeness and understanding about each other will help them go beyond the biological heritage.\nThe farther away you put them, the stronger is the magnetic force. One is more attracted towards the unknown, the unachievable. If the woman is sitting far away, first she looks immensely beautiful, just a goddess who has descended to the earth, because you cannot smell her perspiration, nor do you know that her teeth are false; you know nothing. From far away all grass looks greener.\nMy own understanding and approach is totally different from anyone who has lived before me. I want to bring the male and female sannyasins as close as possible, with no restrictions, with no repressions, with no inhibitions. Sooner or later they are going to be fed up. That is my hope. The whole arrangement here is to make you completely bored.\nAnd every day somebody writes, “Sex has fallen away.” That’s great if it falls away! Repressed sex is bound to create a psychological sickness within you. But when sex drops on its own accord just like a dead leaf dropping from a tree, it does not leave any wound on the tree. When sex drops out of understanding, not with your effort but on its own accord and your unconscious is not carrying any repression, your whole being is purified.\nSo I am saying everything that has not been said. Laughter has been completely avoided, because it seemed that it destroyed your seriousness. And all the masters of the past wanted you to be serious about your search. They misunderstood one thing, that sincerity about the search is one thing, and seriousness about the search is not the same thing. I want you to be sincere and authentic about your search – not only about your search, but about everything, because you cannot be sincere only in one dimension. If you are sincere, then all dimensions of your life are sincere.\nBut seriousness has been misunderstood as sincerity. Seriousness is a sickness. A serious seeker is searching for truth with sadness, with a burden on his head. He is not interested in the pilgrimage. He is only interested in the end, the goal, the paradise, the heaven, whatever name has been chosen by the master. My own understanding is: there is no heaven, and there is no paradise, there is no goal. Life is an eternal pilgrimage.\nNow, making people serious is making them sick for eternity. They will lose all joy, they will shrink, all their juice will be gone. They will not see the beauty of the path and the trees and the mountains that they will be passing through, because seriousness does not allow these things. Seriousness condemns all this as mundane.\nTo me, there is no division like mundane and sacred. It is one universe. There are not two universes. Yes, the same universe you can look at in a mundane way, you can look at in a sacred way. The distinction is not between two universes, the distinction is only in two outlooks. And my feeling is, the more joyous you are, the more full of juice, love, laughter, music and dance, the more your journey will become a tremendously beautiful pilgrimage.\nAnd because there is no goal ... Life is eternal, hence there cannot be any goal. All ideas of goals are contradictory to the idea of eternal life. And if life is eternal, then you have to enjoy each moment as if you have reached the goal. Each moment is a goal in itself. Don’t wait to rejoice when you have reached the goal. That kind of goal does not exist. Use every moment as if you have arrived. It is always as if you have arrived. You are always arriving.\nAnd I don’t think existence wants you to be serious. I have not seen a serious tree. I have not seen a serious bird. I have not seen a serious sunrise. I have not seen a serious starry night. It seems they are all laughing in their own ways, dancing in their own ways. We may not understand it, but there is a subtle feeling that the whole existence is a celebration. I teach you celebration. And laughter has certainly to be one of the major ingredients in this celebration.\nYou are asking, Devageet, “Is there laughter in the mysterious silence of sachchidanand?” Certainly! But a laughter which is very silent. A soundless sound. A ripple-less lake. Full of joy, but it is too much to be expressed. There is no seriousness in the ultimate experience of existence.\nAnd the second thing you are asking is also true. “There must be, because you are such a laughter; or is your laughter just for us?” The laughter of the ultimate experience is silent. You can have a very delicate feeling, but it is not tangible, you cannot hear it. It is more like a whisper. So the second thing is also true, I am absolutely nonserious. I am laughter, but the laughter that I have achieved in my disappearance into the whole you cannot hear. I have to laugh for you the way you can understand it.\nAs far as I am concerned, there is no need for me to remain in the body even for a single moment more. I have done my homework. Whatever I am doing – talking to you, laughing with you, rejoicing with you – my silence, my words, are all dedicated to you, to provoke a certain synchronicity.\nIt is said Buddha never laughed. And you can see Jesus ... it is impossible that that face can laugh. Mahavira cannot laugh. There is only one man ... and because of his laughter all the houses I have stayed in have been called Lao Tzu House. Lao Tzu is the only man who was born laughing. Every child is born crying. That is absolutely unique about Lao Tzu. There are many things in his life which are unique, but nothing to be compared with the fact that he was born laughing. Everybody was shocked. His mother and father could not believe it. Even a smile would have been too much, but he was laughing. And he remained a laughter all his life.\nHe had chosen Chuang Tzu as his disciple just because Chuang Tzu was continuously making everybody laugh. He was creating such absurd stories that nobody in the whole world literature can be compared to him. The stories are so complicated and so absurd, you cannot figure out the meaning. But certainly they tickle you. There are points when you suddenly start laughing. Lao Tzu loved Chuang Tzu for the simple reason that he was an absolutely nonserious man.\nExcept these two enlightened ones, nobody has laughed. But because of their strangeness they have not been able to create a religion like Christianity or Hinduism or Mohammedanism. What they have created has remained an individual approach. They never created any organized church, a pope, a priest, an imam, a shankaracharya. Nobody has succeeded them. Once in a while some individual understands the significance. They have not even named their religion. It is simply called Tao. And Tao means only ‘the path’ – no goal. They understood exactly what I am saying: that there is no goal, but only the path.\nAnd unless you learn to enjoy the journey itself, you will become more and more serious – because the goal is not there – the farther you move on the path, the more shrunken and dead you will be. If you want to remain in tune with life, then remain always in celebration. Find out in every moment, in every situation, a possibility of festivity. And I don’t know a single situation in which you cannot find some way to celebrate.\nEven death I have been teaching you to celebrate. Somebody has become free from the body, and you are crying. Feel ashamed! Somebody is out of jail and you are weeping. You wanted the poor fellow to remain always in the jail! Unless you know how to turn the worst into the best, you are not aware of the real essence of sannyas.\nSo certainly I am laughing for you, speaking for you, living for you, but it is not in any way making you obliged to me. It is just my joy. You need not even be thankful towards me. It is out of my own joy that I will continue to rejoice with you as long as existence goes on giving me a little more time to linger on this shore.\nMy time is up, that is certain. It has been up for almost thirty-five years. But existence is very understanding and very intelligent and very compassionate. It knows that I am not living for myself. And to take me away is not just taking me away, it is taking away millions of people’s laughter, their joy, their possibility of flowering; and existence will not do it. It will allow me a longer holiday. Nor am I in a hurry to reach to the other shore, because I know both the shores are the same; one is on this side of the river, the other is on the other side of the river. When you reach the other side you know it is the same shore, there is nothing different.\nAnd existence understands certainly that my body or my mind are no more a bondage to me. I am no more confined to them. I am already free. Death is not an urgency to make me free. I will continue until I penetrate into the deepest core of your being. All that I have experienced I would love you also to experience. Hence I am not keeping anything secret.\nA psychology professor is teaching a class and tells his students that he is going to conduct a survey about sex. He says to the class, “If you have sex once a day, raise your hand.” About fifteen percent of the students raise their hands.\n“Okay,” says the professor. “If you have sex three times a week, raise your hand.” About forty percent raise their hands.\n“Interesting,” says the professor. “If you have sex once a week, raise your hand.” Another twenty percent do.\nThen the professor asks, “If you have sex once a month, raise your hand.” A few hands go up. “And lastly,” says the professor, with a smile, “does anyone have sex once a year?”\nA little guy in the back of the room starts waving his arms wildly, with a huge grin on his face.\n“And what are you so happy about?” asks the professor. The guy gets up, begins to dance and sing, “Tonight is the night!”\nThe pope decides to visit America. When his plane arrives, a big crowd is there to meet him. As the pope steps off the plane, the crowd chants, “Elvis, Elvis, Elvis!”\nHe says to them, “My children, thank you very much, but I am the pope, not Elvis.”\nHe is picked up in a long white limousine that has Elvis written on the side with big sparkling letters. As he steps into the limo he says, “Bless you, but I am the pope, not Elvis!”\nHe is taken to the hotel where there is a huge crowd standing behind police barricades shouting, “Elvis! Elvis! Elvis!”\nThe pope says with growing irritation, “Thank you my children, but I am the pope, not Elvis!”\nAt last he gets to his room and as he begins to unpack his bags, the door opens and in walk three beautiful women, all dressed only in their underwear. The pope looks at them for a moment and then says, “Okay girls. It is one for the money, two for the show, three to get ready and go man, go!”\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nI AM SURE THAT NO MAN HAS EVER BEEN LOVED SO MUCH BY SO MANY WOMEN. HOW DOES IT FEEL TO HAVE THE BIGGEST HAREM IN THE WORLD?\nDeva Manja, it really feels great! I can repeat the pope: “Okay girls. It is one for the money, two for the show, three to get ready and go man, go!”\nIt is true what you are saying, that no man has ever been loved so much by so many women. But you don’t know one secret. One woman is dangerous; so many women are not dangerous, they fight amongst themselves. I am completely at ease. They don’t have time to fight with me; that is the beauty of having a great crowd of women. It is certainly the biggest harem.\nAnd the second secret you have to understand: it is a love that is not of the ordinary kind. It is a love that has the same fragrance as prayer. It is a love that is the ultimate expression of trust. It does not have hate as its counterpart. It is love totally purified from any impact of its opposite. And moreover, listen to this small joke.\nThe women of the harem are sitting in a circle, casting dice on a thick persian carpet. Slowly, the dice make their way round the circle to the hands of each excited player. All of a sudden, the cry goes up. “It is Camelia tonight! Poor Camelia!”\nWith a deep sigh Camelia rises, and with dragging footsteps she goes out through the velvet curtains.\n“I would hate to be that poor kid,” remarks Gloria. “That is the third time this week she has had to wash the dishes.”\nThe women who love me, they have to wash dishes. They have to clean my clothes, they have to make my bed, they have to cook my food, they have to make my clothes. They have to do all kinds of things, take care of my garden, take care of my body. This is a totally different kind of harem. It is not the harem of the Arabian Nights.\nLove here is prayer. And because it is prayer, there is no jealousy. Otherwise, so many women, if they are in love in a biological sense, will create a chaos. They will start killing each other, just out of jealousy. But I know my people, jealousy does not touch them at all.\nAnd it is not only the women, this harem has a speciality. It has men too. There has never been any harem where men were also in the same love, in the same trust, with the same heart dancing, rejoicing. But you are right, it is certainly something that has never happened before.\nAlthough Mahavira initiated women, all his caretakers were male sannyasins, not a single woman. I see some hidden fear somewhere. Some repressed sexuality seems to be still lurking in the shadows, not very strong, but he has not forgotten his past completely. At least in his mind one thing is certain, the women can drag him down.\nThe same was true with Gautam Buddha, although finally he had to concede. His own mother died after his birth, and his mother’s sister never married – just to look after the child. This second mother, Mahamaya, in her old age came to ask for initiation. He had refused for almost twenty years, hundreds of women, but he could not refuse Mahamaya. He was too much obliged to her. She had given him more than any real mother would give. All that he was, Mahamaya had contributed to. It was impossible to say no to her. So reluctantly he had to give her initiation into sannyas. But once one woman had entered, he could not prevent other women; then hundreds of other women entered.\nBut as far as personal staff was concerned, those who were taking care of his body, of his day, of his food, every small detail, they were all men – not a single woman. Not even Mahamaya was allowed. I think it is something not worth appreciating. I love Gautam Buddha, but what can I do? I can see things which are not right. They are small things. Nobody has noticed them. For twenty-five centuries nobody has criticized that women were not allowed. They could have cooked better. They would have looked after him better. They could have taken care of his health better.\nEvery woman is a born mother. Even a small girl has the qualities of a mother. The man can do the same things, but it doesn’t come from his inner being. There are male nurses in hospitals – not yet in India, but in American jails I came across them. In my first jail there were five women nurses and one male nurse. That male nurse looked stupid.\nIn India the word ‘nurse’ has become feminine. We cannot conceive that a man is a nurse. He can be a doctor, but a nurse? It seems to be cuckoo. And I saw that man who was the nurse, because each week one day he was to take care of me. And I could see the difference. The women nurses were making me at home even in the jail. They were trying to bring the best clothes, they were changing my bedsheets and my pillow covers every day, which is not done – it is usually once a month – they were changing everything every day.\nThey used to go to the market specially to bring fruits and vegetables, because I would not eat the jail food which was non-vegetarian. They would go to the market themselves and they would bring so many fruits and so many vegetables. And I told them that I could not eat that much. But a woman is basically a mother.\nThey cleaned the whole place so that I would not suffer from any smell. They had come to know\nthat I am allergic to smell. They were cleaning every day. And when they were cleaning they would remove me from the place, because while they were cleaning the dust might have disturbed me.\nBut when the male nurse was there, there was no question of making me feel at ease. On the contrary, the male nurse was torturing me. He would come to my cell and he was interested in philosophy. And he would start asking questions and I would say to him, “Just don’t harass me.”\nBut he would say, “I may never see you again.” And once it was two o’clock in the night and I said, “It is enough! And now I will not be able to sleep at all, you have tortured me so much. And a nurse is not supposed to torture, you have to help me.”\nHe said, “You don’t think about me. I will never be able to see you again. So I will ask as many questions as have been in my mind.”\nNot a single female nurse ever asked a single question. It is a totally different world on the inside of a woman.\nMy effort is to create the same quality of love and trust in the men who have by chance joined my caravan. And those qualities are arising. If those qualities don’t arise you remain stuck in the head. If those qualities arise then you can enter into the heart. The woman is born with those qualities of the heart, the man is born with the qualities of the head.\nAnd a disciple has to be feminine. Whether he is male or female doesn’t matter, because without reaching to the heart, there is no way towards being, and no way of disappearing into the universal life source, sachchidanand.\nOne day, young Herschel tells Hymie, “Dad, I have these urges all the time.” Hymie tells him to go and visit the rabbi.\n“Rabbi,” says Herschel, “even in the middle of the night I get an erection.”\n“Pray harder,” advises the rabbi. Herschel goes home and a few days later approaches Hymie. “Dad,” he says, “I still keep getting these urges.”\n“Go and see the rabbi again,” Hymie advises. The rabbi is out, so the rabbi’s wife asks Herschel about his problem.\n“I get these terrible strong urges,” explains Herschel.\n“Oh, that’s simple,” replies the rabbi’s wife. She takes him into the bedroom and makes love to him. When Herschel gets home, Hymie asks, “What happened?”\n“It was wonderful,” Herschel replies. “The rabbi’s wife has more sense between her legs than the rabbi has in his head.”\nOkay, Maneesha?\nYes, Osho.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"4938","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/sat_chit_anand/part21/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/sat_chit_anand/>Sat Chit Anand</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">21 Seriousness is a sickness</h1><div class=post-meta>24 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;4938 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Sat_Chit_Anand/part21.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part20>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

THERE
MUST BE, BECAUSE YOU ARE SUCH A LAUGHTER; OR IS YOUR LAUGHTER JUST FOR
US?</p><p><br></p><p>Devageet, the cosmos is full of laughter, but a laughter that is very
silent, a laughter that you can feel but cannot hear, a laughter that
spreads all over your being. You can feel the lightness and the
benediction that it brings to you, but there is no way to hear it, and
there is no way to compare it to the laughter we are aware of.</p><p><br></p><p>It was for this reason that all the ancient awakened ones have not
talked about laughter. The danger was that you may think the laughter
that you know is the laughter of the ultimate. The difference is very
great. Our laughter is simply ripples on the surface of the lake. The
cosmic laughter of sachchidanand is the whole lake, but without ripples
– utterly silent and serene, still, just like a sweetness, joyfulness,
very delicate, very subtle. The ancient awakened ones never mentioned
it, just as they have never mentioned many other things out of a certain
fear of misunderstanding.</p><p><br></p><p>They have not mentioned that there is an orgasmic joy in the
experience of enlightenment. It is sheer fear that the moment they use
the word ‘orgasmic’ you will think about sexual orgasm. It is not
sexual, it is nonsexual. But as far as the orgasmic experience of utter
relaxedness, of absolute stoppage of time and mind is concerned, it is
the same.</p><p>I have dared to walk on paths untrodden by the ancient awakened ones
because my feeling is that the fear of misunderstanding should not
prevent one from saying the truth. And if one is too afraid of being
misunderstood, then there is nothing to say, because everything is going
to be misunderstood. You talk about truth and it will be understood as a
fact. You talk about consciousness, and people will think, of course,
that they are conscious. Maybe it will be a bigger consciousness, but
there is not going to be any qualitative change. Yet there is going to
be a qualitative change.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact every quantitative change at a certain point turns into a
qualitative change. You heat water. Up to ninety-nine degrees it is
water. The moment it reaches a hundred degrees a transformation happens.
Water starts disappearing into vapor. This is a qualitative change. You
can quench your thirst with the water, but not with the vapor.</p><p><br></p><p>Water always goes downwards, it moves towards the sea, which is the
lowest level. Vapor goes upwards: it creates the clouds. Their paths are
different, their qualities are different. Water is visible, vapor soon
becomes invisible.</p><p><br></p><p>Or, from the other side, at a certain point water can become ice. The
qualities are different. Water is continuously flowing, ice has lost
that flow. It is static, it has become almost like a stone.</p><p><br></p><p>Quantity at a certain point brings a new quality. Out of fear of
being misunderstood, many things have not been said to humanity. Not
that they were not known to those who have come to the highest peak, but
they have chosen to speak only of certain aspects. Even those certain
aspects are misunderstood. And many they have left unsaid. They know
that when you reach, you will experience.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t want to leave anything unsaid. I don’t function out of fear
at all. And I trust my people’s intelligence more than any awakened
person has ever trusted.</p><p><br></p><p>Mahavira never allowed his male and female sannyasins to be together
– a fear that they might fall back into their old habits. He arranged
that the women sannyasins should remain separate from the men
sannyasins. If you go into details you can see the fear. The women
sannyasins should always bow down to the men sannyasins, even if the
male sannyasin may be just one day old. He may have taken sannyas just
one day before, still a sixty-year-old woman sannyasin has to bow down
to this young person. She has been a sannyasin for sixty years. The
reason? The reason is that whenever a woman bows down to a man there is
a protection. She is paying so much respect to you, you cannot behave in
any disrespectful way towards her. And according to Mahavira, even to
think about sex will be disrespectful.</p><p><br></p><p>But all these details have a hidden psychology of fear. All male
sannyasins and women sannyasins had to move in a group of five; nobody
was allowed to move alone. Why? Lions move alone because they are
unafraid. What is the fear? Why should five men move together? So they
can keep an eye on each other, that nobody falls below the discipline,
that nobody does things which are not allowed.</p><p><br></p><p>Five women moving together will keep alert about each other, will see
that nobody falls in love, nobody becomes too much attached to anyone.
Mahavira has put four against one. Their jealousy, their
competitiveness, and their very nature of putting the other down will
keep them alert. But this is functioning out of fear.</p><p>And I know Mahavira was not afraid as far as he himself was
concerned. He was afraid about his disciples. That means he was not as
respectful to the disciples and their intelligence as he should have
been. My feeling is, if I am not respectful towards you and I cannot
trust you, then no arrangement is going to help. And all these people in
the past ... although they thought of every detail, there were always
loopholes. Sannyasins have been finding ways for perverted sex.</p><p><br></p><p>Gautam Buddha was afraid even to initiate women in his commune as
sannyasins. He remained very stubborn. But that was out of a certain
fear that if women entered in the commune ... He did not believe in his
own sannyasins. He knew that they would start falling back into their
biological heritage.</p><p><br></p><p>Hence many things have not been said and many disciplines have been
created which ultimately turn into fetters. And all these people were
trying to help you to attain ultimate freedom. But if you want freedom,
then you have to start with freedom. If you start with bondage, you
cannot end with freedom. Freedom has to be the first if you want freedom
to be the last, because it is a growth. They fettered their people so
tightly. In Buddhism there are thirty-three thousand rules of
discipline. Now, you have put almost the whole Himalayas on the chests
of your sannyasins. They are small things</p><p>...</p><p><br></p><p>A sannyasin is going to preach in faraway places where Buddha cannot
go, because he is too old. Before he leaves, Buddha says, “Remember a
few things. Don’t talk to a woman.”</p><p><br></p><p>The young sannyasin must have been a man of tremendous courage. He
said, “Generally, you are right. There is no need for me to talk to any
woman. But there is a possibility ... at least one percent you should
keep open. Ninety-nine percent of the time I will not talk, but there
can be a situation in which talking becomes absolutely necessary. If I
am standing on a crossroad and I don’t know where to go, where the
village is, and a woman comes by, should I ask her or not? Or should I
remain stuck on the crossroad? Or a woman falls into a ditch and I am
passing by, should I ask her if I can help?”</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha was silent. Then he said, “Okay, for one percent you are
allowed. Remember, that is only in emergency situations. But never touch
a woman.” The man was again raising the same question. “There can be a
situation when you have to touch a woman. A woman falls on the road,
maybe sunstroke, maybe epilepsy, maybe some kind of coma ... Do you want
me not to touch her? There are emergency situations when it will be very
uncompassionate not to touch the woman. And I think compassion is the
foundation of your philosophy.”</p><p><br></p><p>Very reluctantly Buddha said, “Okay, in emergency situations you can
touch a woman, but remember one thing, whenever you are close to a
woman, speaking to her or touching her, be very alert. Don’t get back to
your old habits, which are tremendously powerful, because they belong to
your whole past of millions of years.”</p><p><br></p><p>But that one percent emergency becomes the loophole. Who is going to
decide what is emergency and what is not? So all the rules, thirty-three
thousand in all, have their loopholes. You cannot have a foolproof
system. Human beings are human beings.</p><p><br></p><p>My approach is totally different. My approach is to bring men and
women so close together that there is no need to keep arbitrary
disciplines. Just their very closeness, slowly, slowly, will make</p><p>them drop their differences. Their closeness and understanding about
each other will help them go beyond the biological heritage.</p><p><br></p><p>The farther away you put them, the stronger is the magnetic force.
One is more attracted towards the unknown, the unachievable. If the
woman is sitting far away, first she looks immensely beautiful, just a
goddess who has descended to the earth, because you cannot smell her
perspiration, nor do you know that her teeth are false; you know
nothing. From far away all grass looks greener.</p><p><br></p><p>My own understanding and approach is totally different from anyone
who has lived before me. I want to bring the male and female sannyasins
as close as possible, with no restrictions, with no repressions, with no
inhibitions. Sooner or later they are going to be fed up. That is my
hope. The whole arrangement here is to make you completely bored.</p><p><br></p><p>And every day somebody writes, “Sex has fallen away.” That’s great if
it falls away! Repressed sex is bound to create a psychological sickness
within you. But when sex drops on its own accord just like a dead leaf
dropping from a tree, it does not leave any wound on the tree. When sex
drops out of understanding, not with your effort but on its own accord
and your unconscious is not carrying any repression, your whole being is
purified.</p><p><br></p><p>So I am saying everything that has not been said. Laughter has been
completely avoided, because it seemed that it destroyed your
seriousness. And all the masters of the past wanted you to be serious
about your search. They misunderstood one thing, that sincerity about
the search is one thing, and seriousness about the search is not the
same thing. I want you to be sincere and authentic about your search –
not only about your search, but about everything, because you cannot be
sincere only in one dimension. If you are sincere, then all dimensions
of your life are sincere.</p><p><br></p><p>But seriousness has been misunderstood as sincerity. Seriousness is a
sickness. A serious seeker is searching for truth with sadness, with a
burden on his head. He is not interested in the pilgrimage. He is only
interested in the end, the goal, the paradise, the heaven, whatever name
has been chosen by the master. My own understanding is: there is no
heaven, and there is no paradise, there is no goal. Life is an eternal
pilgrimage.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, making people serious is making them sick for eternity. They
will lose all joy, they will shrink, all their juice will be gone. They
will not see the beauty of the path and the trees and the mountains that
they will be passing through, because seriousness does not allow these
things. Seriousness condemns all this as mundane.</p><p><br></p><p>To me, there is no division like mundane and sacred. It is one
universe. There are not two universes. Yes, the same universe you can
look at in a mundane way, you can look at in a sacred way. The
distinction is not between two universes, the distinction is only in two
outlooks. And my feeling is, the more joyous you are, the more full of
juice, love, laughter, music and dance, the more your journey will
become a tremendously beautiful pilgrimage.</p><p><br></p><p>And because there is no goal ... Life is eternal, hence there cannot
be any goal. All ideas of goals are contradictory to the idea of eternal
life. And if life is eternal, then you have to enjoy each moment as if
you have reached the goal. Each moment is a goal in itself. Don’t wait
to rejoice when you have reached the goal. That kind of goal does not
exist. Use every moment as if you have arrived. It is always as if you
have arrived. You are always arriving.</p><p>And I don’t think existence wants you to be serious. I have not seen
a serious tree. I have not seen a serious bird. I have not seen a
serious sunrise. I have not seen a serious starry night. It seems they
are all laughing in their own ways, dancing in their own ways. We may
not understand it, but there is a subtle feeling that the whole
existence is a celebration. I teach you celebration. And laughter has
certainly to be one of the major ingredients in this celebration.</p><p><br></p><p>You are asking, Devageet, “Is there laughter in the mysterious
silence of sachchidanand?” Certainly! But a laughter which is very
silent. A soundless sound. A ripple-less lake. Full of joy, but it is
too much to be expressed. There is no seriousness in the ultimate
experience of existence.</p><p><br></p><p>And the second thing you are asking is also true. “There must be,
because you are such a laughter; or is your laughter just for us?” The
laughter of the ultimate experience is silent. You can have a very
delicate feeling, but it is not tangible, you cannot hear it. It is more
like a whisper. So the second thing is also true, I am absolutely
nonserious. I am laughter, but the laughter that I have achieved in my
disappearance into the whole you cannot hear. I have to laugh for you
the way you can understand it.</p><p><br></p><p>As far as I am concerned, there is no need for me to remain in the
body even for a single moment more. I have done my homework. Whatever I
am doing – talking to you, laughing with you, rejoicing with you – my
silence, my words, are all dedicated to you, to provoke a certain
synchronicity.</p><p><br></p><p>It is said Buddha never laughed. And you can see Jesus ... it is
impossible that that face can laugh. Mahavira cannot laugh. There is
only one man ... and because of his laughter all the houses I have
stayed in have been called Lao Tzu House. Lao Tzu is the only man who
was born laughing. Every child is born crying. That is absolutely unique
about Lao Tzu. There are many things in his life which are unique, but
nothing to be compared with the fact that he was born laughing.
Everybody was shocked. His mother and father could not believe it. Even
a smile would have been too much, but he was laughing. And he remained a
laughter all his life.</p><p><br></p><p>He had chosen Chuang Tzu as his disciple just because Chuang Tzu was
continuously making everybody laugh. He was creating such absurd stories
that nobody in the whole world literature can be compared to him. The
stories are so complicated and so absurd, you cannot figure out the
meaning. But certainly they tickle you. There are points when you
suddenly start laughing. Lao Tzu loved Chuang Tzu for the simple reason
that he was an absolutely nonserious man.</p><p><br></p><p>Except these two enlightened ones, nobody has laughed. But because of
their strangeness they have not been able to create a religion like
Christianity or Hinduism or Mohammedanism. What they have created has
remained an individual approach. They never created any organized
church, a pope, a priest, an imam, a shankaracharya. Nobody has
succeeded them. Once in a while some individual understands the
significance. They have not even named their religion. It is simply
called Tao. And Tao means only ‘the path’ – no goal. They understood
exactly what I am saying: that there is no goal, but only the path.</p><p><br></p><p>And unless you learn to enjoy the journey itself, you will become
more and more serious – because the goal is not there – the farther you
move on the path, the more shrunken and dead you will be. If you want to
remain in tune with life, then remain always in celebration. Find out in
every moment, in every situation, a possibility of festivity. And I
don’t know a single situation in which you cannot find some way to
celebrate.</p><p>Even death I have been teaching you to celebrate. Somebody has become
free from the body, and you are crying. Feel ashamed! Somebody is out of
jail and you are weeping. You wanted the poor fellow to remain always in
the jail! Unless you know how to turn the worst into the best, you are
not aware of the real essence of sannyas.</p><p><br></p><p>So certainly I am laughing for you, speaking for you, living for you,
but it is not in any way making you obliged to me. It is just my joy.
You need not even be thankful towards me. It is out of my own joy that I
will continue to rejoice with you as long as existence goes on giving me
a little more time to linger on this shore.</p><p><br></p><p>My time is up, that is certain. It has been up for almost thirty-five
years. But existence is very understanding and very intelligent and very
compassionate. It knows that I am not living for myself. And to take me
away is not just taking me away, it is taking away millions of people’s
laughter, their joy, their possibility of flowering; and existence will
not do it. It will allow me a longer holiday. Nor am I in a hurry to
reach to the other shore, because I know both the shores are the same;
one is on this side of the river, the other is on the other side of the
river. When you reach the other side you know it is the same shore,
there is nothing different.</p><p><br></p><p>And existence understands certainly that my body or my mind are no
more a bondage to me. I am no more confined to them. I am already free.
Death is not an urgency to make me free. I will continue until I
penetrate into the deepest core of your being. All that I have
experienced I would love you also to experience. Hence I am not keeping
anything secret.</p><p><br></p><p>A psychology professor is teaching a class and tells his students
that he is going to conduct a survey about sex. He says to the class,
“If you have sex once a day, raise your hand.” About fifteen percent of
the students raise their hands.</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay,” says the professor. “If you have sex three times a week,
raise your hand.” About forty percent raise their hands.</p><p><br></p><p>“Interesting,” says the professor. “If you have sex once a week,
raise your hand.” Another twenty percent do.</p><p><br></p><p>Then the professor asks, “If you have sex once a month, raise your
hand.” A few hands go up. “And lastly,” says the professor, with a
smile, “does anyone have sex once a year?”</p><p>A little guy in the back of the room starts waving his arms wildly,
with a huge grin on his face.</p><p><br></p><p>“And what are you so happy about?” asks the professor. The guy gets
up, begins to dance and sing, “Tonight is the night!”</p><p><br></p><p>The pope decides to visit America. When his plane arrives, a big
crowd is there to meet him. As the pope steps off the plane, the crowd
chants, “Elvis, Elvis, Elvis!”</p><p><br></p><p>He says to them, “My children, thank you very much, but I am the
pope, not Elvis.”</p><p>He is picked up in a long white limousine that has Elvis written on
the side with big sparkling letters. As he steps into the limo he says,
“Bless you, but I am the pope, not Elvis!”</p><p><br></p><p>He is taken to the hotel where there is a huge crowd standing behind
police barricades shouting, “Elvis! Elvis! Elvis!”</p><p><br></p><p>The pope says with growing irritation, “Thank you my children, but I
am the pope, not Elvis!”</p><p><br></p><p>At last he gets to his room and as he begins to unpack his bags, the
door opens and in walk three beautiful women, all dressed only in their
underwear. The pope looks at them for a moment and then says, “Okay
girls. It is one for the money, two for the show, three to get ready and
go man, go!”</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>I AM SURE THAT NO MAN HAS EVER BEEN LOVED SO MUCH BY SO MANY WOMEN.
HOW DOES IT FEEL TO HAVE THE BIGGEST HAREM IN THE WORLD?</p><p><br></p><p>Deva Manja, it really feels great! I can repeat the pope: “Okay
girls. It is one for the money, two for the show, three to get ready and
go man, go!”</p><p><br></p><p>It is true what you are saying, that no man has ever been loved so
much by so many women. But you don’t know one secret. One woman is
dangerous; so many women are not dangerous, they fight amongst
themselves. I am completely at ease. They don’t have time to fight with
me; that is the beauty of having a great crowd of women. It is certainly
the biggest harem.</p><p><br></p><p>And the second secret you have to understand: it is a love that is
not of the ordinary kind. It is a love that has the same fragrance as
prayer. It is a love that is the ultimate expression of trust. It does
not have hate as its counterpart. It is love totally purified from any
impact of its opposite. And moreover, listen to this small joke.</p><p><br></p><p>The women of the harem are sitting in a circle, casting dice on a
thick persian carpet. Slowly, the dice make their way round the circle
to the hands of each excited player. All of a sudden, the cry goes up.
“It is Camelia tonight! Poor Camelia!”</p><p><br></p><p>With a deep sigh Camelia rises, and with dragging footsteps she goes
out through the velvet curtains.</p><p><br></p><p>“I would hate to be that poor kid,” remarks Gloria. “That is the
third time this week she has had to wash the dishes.”</p><p><br></p><p>The women who love me, they have to wash dishes. They have to clean
my clothes, they have to make my bed, they have to cook my food, they
have to make my clothes. They have to do all kinds of things, take care
of my garden, take care of my body. This is a totally different kind of
harem. It is not the harem of the Arabian Nights.</p><p>Love here is prayer. And because it is prayer, there is no jealousy.
Otherwise, so many women, if they are in love in a biological sense,
will create a chaos. They will start killing each other, just out of
jealousy. But I know my people, jealousy does not touch them at all.</p><p><br></p><p>And it is not only the women, this harem has a speciality. It has men
too. There has never been any harem where men were also in the same
love, in the same trust, with the same heart dancing, rejoicing. But you
are right, it is certainly something that has never happened before.</p><p><br></p><p>Although Mahavira initiated women, all his caretakers were male
sannyasins, not a single woman. I see some hidden fear somewhere. Some
repressed sexuality seems to be still lurking in the shadows, not very
strong, but he has not forgotten his past completely. At least in his
mind one thing is certain, the women can drag him down.</p><p><br></p><p>The same was true with Gautam Buddha, although finally he had to
concede. His own mother died after his birth, and his mother’s sister
never married – just to look after the child. This second mother,
Mahamaya, in her old age came to ask for initiation. He had refused for
almost twenty years, hundreds of women, but he could not refuse
Mahamaya. He was too much obliged to her. She had given him more than
any real mother would give. All that he was, Mahamaya had contributed
to. It was impossible to say no to her. So reluctantly he had to give
her initiation into sannyas. But once one woman had entered, he could
not prevent other women; then hundreds of other women entered.</p><p><br></p><p>But as far as personal staff was concerned, those who were taking
care of his body, of his day, of his food, every small detail, they were
all men – not a single woman. Not even Mahamaya was allowed. I think it
is something not worth appreciating. I love Gautam Buddha, but what can
I do? I can see things which are not right. They are small things.
Nobody has noticed them. For twenty-five centuries nobody has criticized
that women were not allowed. They could have cooked better. They would
have looked after him better. They could have taken care of his health
better.</p><p><br></p><p>Every woman is a born mother. Even a small girl has the qualities of
a mother. The man can do the same things, but it doesn’t come from his
inner being. There are male nurses in hospitals – not yet in India, but
in American jails I came across them. In my first jail there were five
women nurses and one male nurse. That male nurse looked stupid.</p><p><br></p><p>In India the word ‘nurse’ has become feminine. We cannot conceive
that a man is a nurse. He can be a doctor, but a nurse? It seems to be
cuckoo. And I saw that man who was the nurse, because each week one day
he was to take care of me. And I could see the difference. The women
nurses were making me at home even in the jail. They were trying to
bring the best clothes, they were changing my bedsheets and my pillow
covers every day, which is not done – it is usually once a month – they
were changing everything every day.</p><p><br></p><p>They used to go to the market specially to bring fruits and
vegetables, because I would not eat the jail food which was
non-vegetarian. They would go to the market themselves and they would
bring so many fruits and so many vegetables. And I told them that I
could not eat that much. But a woman is basically a mother.</p><p><br></p><p>They cleaned the whole place so that I would not suffer from any
smell. They had come to know</p><p>that I am allergic to smell. They were cleaning every day. And when
they were cleaning they would remove me from the place, because while
they were cleaning the dust might have disturbed me.</p><p>But when the male nurse was there, there was no question of making me
feel at ease. On the contrary, the male nurse was torturing me. He would
come to my cell and he was interested in philosophy. And he would start
asking questions and I would say to him, “Just don’t harass me.”</p><p>But he would say, “I may never see you again.” And once it was two
o’clock in the night and I said, “It is enough! And now I will not be
able to sleep at all, you have tortured me so much. And a nurse is not
supposed to torture, you have to help me.”</p><p>He said, “You don’t think about me. I will never be able to see you
again. So I will ask as many questions as have been in my mind.”</p><p>Not a single female nurse ever asked a single question. It is a
totally different world on the inside of a woman.</p><p>My effort is to create the same quality of love and trust in the men
who have by chance joined my caravan. And those qualities are arising.
If those qualities don’t arise you remain stuck in the head. If those
qualities arise then you can enter into the heart. The woman is born
with those qualities of the heart, the man is born with the qualities of
the head.</p><p>And a disciple has to be feminine. Whether he is male or female
doesn’t matter, because without reaching to the heart, there is no way
towards being, and no way of disappearing into the universal life
source, sachchidanand.</p><p>One day, young Herschel tells Hymie, “Dad, I have these urges all the
time.” Hymie tells him to go and visit the rabbi.</p><p>“Rabbi,” says Herschel, “even in the middle of the night I get an
erection.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Pray harder,” advises the rabbi. Herschel goes home and a few days
later approaches Hymie. “Dad,” he says, “I still keep getting these
urges.”</p><p>“Go and see the rabbi again,” Hymie advises. The rabbi is out, so the
rabbi’s wife asks Herschel about his problem.</p><p>“I get these terrible strong urges,” explains Herschel.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, that’s simple,” replies the rabbi’s wife. She takes him into the
bedroom and makes love to him. When Herschel gets home, Hymie asks,
“What happened?”</p><p>“It was wonderful,” Herschel replies. “The rabbi’s wife has more
sense between her legs than the rabbi has in his head.”</p><p>Okay, Maneesha?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, Osho.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part20>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

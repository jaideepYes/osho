BUT FOR TEN YEARS, WHENEVER I SEE YOU ENTERING THE AUDITORIUM, THERE IS THIS SURPRISE ABOUT YOUR UNBELIEVABLE OUTER BEAUTY TOO.\nOSHO, IS THE OUTER APPEARANCE ALWAYS JUST A REFLECTION OF THE INNER?\nPragito, the outer beauty comes from a different source than the inner. The outer beauty comes from your father and mother: their bodies create your body. But the inner beauty comes from your own growth of consciousness that you are carrying from many lives.\nIn your individuality both are joined, the physical heritage from your father and mother and the spiritual heritage of your own past lives, its consciousness, its bliss, its joy.\nSo it is not absolutely necessary that the outer will be a reflection of the inner, nor will vice versa be true, that the inner will correspond with the outer.\nBut sometimes it happens that your inner beauty is so much, your inner light is so much that it starts radiating from your outer body. Your outer body may not be beautiful, but the light that comes from your sources, your innermost sources of eternal life, will make even a body which is not beautiful in the ordinary sense appear beautiful, radiant.\nBut vice versa it is never true. Your outer beauty is only skin-deep. It cannot affect your inner beauty. On the contrary the outer beauty becomes a hindrance in search of the inner: you become too identified with the outer. Who is going to look for the inner sources? Most often it happens that the people who are outwardly very beautiful, are inwardly very ugly. Their outer beauty becomes a cover-up to hide themselves behind, and it is experienced by millions of people every day. You fall in love with a woman or a man, because you can see only the outer. And just within a few days you start discovering his inner state; it doesn’t correspond to his outer beauty. On the contrary it is very ugly.\nFor example, Alexander the Great had a very beautiful body but he killed millions of people, just to fulfill his ego that he is the world conqueror. He met one man, Diogenes, when he was on his way to India, who lived naked, the only man in Greece who did, unique in a way. His beauty was tremendous, not just the outer, but the inner radiance was so much and so dazzling that even Alexander had to stop his armies when he was close by in a forest near a river. He stopped the armies and went to see Diogenes alone; alone, because he did not want anybody to know that there exists a man who is far more beautiful than Alexander himself.\nIt was early morning and Diogenes was taking a sunbath, naked on the riverbank. Alexander could not believe that a beggar ... He had nothing, no possessions – even Buddha used to have a begging bowl, but that too Diogenes had thrown away. He was absolutely without any possessions, exactly as he was born, naked.\nAlexander could not believe his eyes. He had never seen such a beautiful personality and he could see that this beauty was not just on the outer side. Something infiltrated from the inner; a subtle radiation, a subtle aura surrounded him. All around him there was a fragrance, a silence.\nIf the inner becomes beautiful – which is in your hands – the outer will have to mold itself according to the inner. The outer is not essential, it will have to reflect the inner in some way.\nBut the converse is not true at all. You can have plastic surgery, you can have a beautiful face, beautiful eyes, a beautiful nose; you can change your skin; you can change your shape. That is not going to change your being. Inside you will still remain greedy, full of lust, violence, anger, rage, jealousy, with a tremendous will to power. All these things the plastic surgeon can do nothing about.\nFor that you will need a different kind of surgery. It is happening here: you are on the table. As you become more and more meditative, peaceful, a deep at-onement with existence happens. You fall into the rhythm of the universe. The universe also has its own heartbeat. Your heartbeat, once it starts in rhythm with the universal heartbeat, will have transformed your being from that ugly stage of animality, into authentic humanity.\nAnd even the human is not the end. You can go on searching deeper and there is a place where you transcend humanity and something of the divine enters in you. Once the divine is there, it is almost like a light in a dark house. The windows will start showing the light; even the cracks in the wall or the roof or the doors will start showing the inner light.\nThe inner is tremendously powerful, the outer is very weak. The inner is eternal, the outer is very temporary. How many years do you remain young? And as youth fades away you start feeling that\nyou are becoming ugly, unless your inner being is also growing with your age. Then even in your old age you will have a beauty that the youth may feel jealous of.\nRemember, from the inner the change to the outer happens, but I am not making it inevitable. Most often it happens, but sometimes the outer is in such a rotten state that even the inner radiation cannot change it.\nThere have been cases on record: one very great mystic of India – I have spoken on him for almost half a year continuously. His name was Ashtavakra. And what he has written is tremendously important; each sentence has so many dimensions to be explored, but the man himself was in a very difficult situation.\nAshtavakra – the name was given to him, because he was almost like a camel. In eight places he was distorted in the body – one leg was longer, one arm was shorter, his back was bent – in eight places he was distorted. That’s how he was born, with a crippled, distorted body. But even in a crippled and distorted body the soul is as beautiful as in the most beautiful body.\nHe became enlightened, but his body was too rigid to change with his inner change. His eyes started showing something of the beauty, but the whole body was in such a mess.\nThe story is that the emperor of India in those days was Janak and he was very much interested in philosophical discussions. Each year he used to call a big conference of all the scholars, philosophers, theologians or whoever wanted to participate. It was a championship competition.\nOne very famous philosopher, Yagnavalkya came a little late. The conference had started and he saw standing outside one thousand beautiful cows. Their horns were covered with gold and diamonds. This was going to be the prize for the champion. It was a hot day and the cows were perspiring.\nHe told his disciples, “You take these cows. As far as winning the competition is concerned, I am certain. Why should the cows suffer here? You take them to our place.” They had their own place in the forest.\nEven Janak could not prevent him, because he knew that he had been the champion continuously for five years, and he would be the champion this time, because there was nobody else who could defeat him. It is not right to take the reward before you have won, but his victory was so certain to everybody that nobody objected. And his disciples took away all the cows.\nWhile Yagnavalkya was discussing, a very unknown scholar was also present in the conference. Ashtavakra was this unknown philosopher’s son. His mother was waiting for her husband to come home. It was getting late and the meal was getting cold. So she sent Ashtavakra to bring his father home, because he could not win the competition. Why should he unnecessarily waste his time? He was a poor scholar and there were great scholars there. Ashtavakra went. There were at least one thousand people in the conference, the highly cultured and sophisticated scholars of the country.\nAs Ashtavakra entered, looking at his distorted body they all started laughing. But Ashtavakra was a man of tremendous integrity. As they started laughing, he laughed even louder. Because of his loud laugh they stopped. They could not believe that he was laughing.\nJanak asked him, “I can understand why they are laughing – because of your body; but I cannot understand why you are laughing. And you stopped all their laughing with your laughter.” A single man stopped one thousand people’s laughter.\nAshtavakra said to Janak, “I thought this conference was for scholars and philosophers, but these are all shoemakers. They can understand only the skin. They cannot see the inner, they can only see the outer.”\nThere was a great silence. What he was saying had a great truth in it. Janak dissolved the conference and said, “Now I would like to inquire of Ashtavakra only. He has defeated you all just by his laughter and his statement that, ‘You can’t see the inner, you can only see the outer; you are all shoemakers.’ Shoemakers work with the skin of different animals. I dissolve the conference and, Yagnavalka, return those one thousand cows, because you also laughed. And when Ashtavakra laughed, you also stopped!”\nIt was a very strange situation; it had never happened before. And then began the long inquiry of Janak, the emperor. He asked questions and Ashtavakra answered them. Each answer in itself carried so much meaning and significance.\nBecause his body was in such a bad shape he could not get identified with it. Sometimes blessings come in such disguise. He could not go out, because wherever he went people would laugh, “Look at that man! Have you seen anything uglier than this?”\nSo most of the time he was in the house, meditating, figuring out, “Who am I? Certainly I am not this body, because I can be aware of this body, I can observe this body from within. Certainly that awareness has to be different from the body.”\nBecause of his crippled body he experienced enlightenment. The only barrier is identification with the body. But he could not identify, the body was so ugly. He never looked in a mirror; it would have been such a shock.\nBut Yagnavalkya had to return those one thousand cows to Ashtavakra’s house. He was young and he defeated one thousand old philosophers, well-versed in the ancient scriptures.\nIt is one of the strangest things in this country that on every book written by any prominent mystic there have been hundreds of commentaries, but nobody has commented before me on Ashtavakra. And he must be at least five thousand years old. For five thousand years nobody has bothered to look into his statements, which are so significant.\nBut his inner enlightenment, his inner understanding could not change his outer appearance. And yet for those who are going deeper into themselves, the outer does not matter. They would have seen even in Ashtavakra tremendous beauty, but it would not have been of the outer circumference, but of the center.\nMost often the inner change changes the outer, if the outer is not too rigid. But the outer never changes the inner.\nYou need to have eyes, going deep into people’s beings, which is possible only if you are going inwards yourself. The deeper you go into yourself the deeper you can look into other people’s beings. And then a totally new world opens its doors.\nFlanagan is on his deathbed and Father Murphy has come to give him the last rites. “Open your eyes,” says the priest. “We have got to save your immortal soul.” Flanagan opens one eye, closes it and tries to doze off. He is having such a nice snooze.\n“Come on now!” says Father Murphy. “If you don’t want to confess, at least answer me this: do you renounce the devil and all his works?”\n“Well, I don’t know,” says Flanagan, opening one eye again. “At a time like this it doesn’t seem very smart to upset anyone.”\nThe inner comes out, you cannot hide it much. Now he is being very calculating. At the time of death, unnecessarily annoying anybody ... and who knows where you are going? It is better to keep silent.\nA wealthy widower and his beautiful daughter are on a sea cruise. By chance the girl falls overboard, and Rubin Fingelbaum, aged seventy, splashes in afterwards and rescues her. After the two are brought on board the ship, the widower throws his arms around Rubin.\n“You saved my daughter’s life,” he cries. “I’m a rich man – I will give you anything! Ask for whatever you want!”\n“Just answer me one question,” replies Rubin. “Who pushed me?” What is inside is bound to come outside.\nHow can you hide it?\nAn old black preacher had used the letters B.S., M.S. and Ph.D. after his name for many years without ever having had anyone from his congregation ask what they meant. Finally a nosey old woman questions him about it.\n“Well, sister,” he answers. “You know what B.S. stands for, don’t you?” “I sure do,” says the lady indignantly. “Bull shit!”\n“Right,” says the preacher. “And M.S. just means more of the same, and Ph.D. means piled high and deep.”\nThat’s the inner side of most people: bull shit, B.S.; M.S., more of the same; and Ph.D., piled high and deep.\nNo plastic surgeon can change it. But you are capable of changing it yourself. It is within your hands. Nobody can do anything about your inner being except you. You are the master of your inner world.\nAnd as the inner world becomes silent, naturally your eyes become deeper, with an oceanic depth. As your inner being becomes cloudless your face also becomes cloudless, just an open sky. As your inner being comes to discover the source of your life, the flame of your life, something of that flame starts radiating from every pore of your body.\nThis is the rule. Ashtavakra is an exception. Exceptions don’t make the rule, they only prove the rule. But it has never happened vice versa before, and I don’t think it can ever happen.\nWe are all trying to be beautiful on the outside: all kinds of make-up, all kinds of things are going on to make your outer beautiful.\nI have heard ...\nA man was catching flies. Finally after two or three hours’ effort he caught four flies. He told his wife, “I have caught four flies: two are male, two are female.”\nThe wife said, “My God, how did you figure out who is male and who is female?”\nHe said, “Easy! Two were sitting for almost two hours on the mirror and two were for two hours reading the newspaper!”\nWe are so much identified with the periphery of our being that we have forgotten that the periphery does not exist in itself. There must be a center inside. And the search for the center is the only religious search – not for God, not for heaven, not for any rewards for your virtues, not to avoid hell and punishment.\nThere is only one authentic religious search and that is to know your innermost being. It is the being of the whole universe. By entering your innermost temple you have entered the real temple. All other temples are false, man-manufactured; all other gods in those temples are false, they are man-manufactured.\nOnly one thing is not man-manufactured and that is your innermost dignity, your innermost grace. That grace starts flooding your outer being too. And that grace transforms not only the inner, but gives a new look to your outer being: an innocence, a serenity, a depth, a peace, a love, and these are all flowers blossoming around you. Then even your periphery becomes so beautiful, so musical, such a dance of rejoicing ...\nBut you should start from the inner. Question 2\nBELOVED OSHO, WHAT IS CIVILIZATION?\nMilarepa, civilization has not happened yet. It is a false idea that we are civilized people – civilized people and continuously preparing for war?\nEven the animals don’t eat, don’t kill their own species. It is only man who kills his own species – no lion will kill another lion, no dog will kill another dog. No lion will eat another lion. Man is the only one who can be a cannibal. There are still small groups around the world in isolated places who are cannibals. They are remnants of the past, but they are still there.\nIn Africa there is a small cannibal colony in the thick forest. There used to be three thousand at the beginning of this century; now they are only three hundred because, when they cannot find anybody else, they have to eat somebody from their own group. They are getting reduced in numbers – they eat their own children, they eat their own parents. Once in a while they get a Christian missionary, but that is very rare.\nOnce they caught a very fat Christian missionary and they were immensely happy. There was dancing and celebration, a big pot on the fire was boiling and the Christian missionary asked, “What is this celebration for? I have come here to give you a taste of Christianity.”\nThey said, “You wait, soon we will have the first taste of Christianity.”\nHe said, “How are you going to have the first taste of Christianity if I don’t give it to you?” They said, “Don’t be worried, you will have to give it.”\nHe said, “I don’t understand what you are talking about.”\nThey said, “Look at that fire and the big pot. We will put you in the pot. When the water is hot enough, we will make a soup of you and that will be our first taste of Christianity!”\nOnce perhaps the whole of humanity was cannibal.\nIn emergency situations one falls back. For example, when there was a famine in Bengal, people were found eating their own children. You cannot conceive it, but rather than die it seems to be logical and rational to eat your own children. Those who were not able to do such a thing sold their children, knowing perfectly well that the people who were purchasing their children would eat them. And with the money they purchased other people’s children. This way they protected their conscience a little bit, but not much, because it was absolutely clear what was going to happen.\nIn emergency situations man shows his real face; otherwise our civilization is only a mask.\nIn a civilized humanity a few things are absolutely necessary. One: there should be no possibility of war because it is life-destructive. And a civilized humanity will have the sensitivity not to destroy life in any form.\nGeorge Bernard Shaw had around his house a beautiful garden where he had collected exotic roses from different countries, different colors, different fragrances. A friend had come to see him and he saw the roses. He could not believe that there were so many colors and so many different fragrances. When he went inside he asked Bernard Shaw, “You have such beautiful flowers, but you don’t put them in a flowerpot inside your sitting room?”\nBernard Shaw said, “I am a civilized man. I love children, but that does not mean I should cut off their heads and decorate my sitting room with them. I love roses, but that does not mean that I have to cut the living flower from its life source and put it here in my sitting room. That would be uncivilized behavior.”\nEven to cut a flower is uncivilized behavior, what to say about people like Genghis Khan, who killed forty million people; Tamerlane, who killed thirty million people; Nadir Shah, he again killed forty million people, and statistics are not available about many others. Alexander the Great, Napoleon Bonaparte, Ivan the Terrible ... no data is available, but they must have killed more people than Genghis Khan, Tamerlane, Nadir Shah. Data is available on Joseph Stalin, Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini, and they were not very far away from our present time, just forty years ago. They killed millions of people for no reason at all.\nThis destructiveness is a death-oriented ideology and it is so deeply rooted in our minds that it keeps us below the animals.\nMan, Milarepa, is not yet civilized. His civilization will begin by dropping war, by dropping nations. What is the need of nations if you are not going to fight? Nations are needed for wars. Why create these stupid lines on the map of the world?\nThe world is one. There are no natural lines dividing nations. Then why do you go on? There is a deep desire to dominate and there are so many people in the world to dominate: they need many nations. Otherwise just a single government, a functional government for the whole world will be enough.\nWhat is the need of so many laws, if man is civilized? What is the need of so many courts, jails, so many legal advisers, if man is civilized? A civilized man will not commit murders, a civilized man will not rape women ... but we keep this whole paraphernalia of courts, laws, constitutions, legal experts; for whom?\nMan is still a criminal. And these jails, these judges and these laws prevent nothing. Jails go on growing, judges go on increasing – more and more of them; more courts, more legal experts, thousands of colleges around the world producing legal experts every year. But even they cannot manage, for the criminals increase at a faster rate, and they don’t have a college, they are not educated.\nSomething is basically wrong, something is missing. What is missing? I call it meditation.\nOnly meditation can make humanity civilized, because meditation will release your creativity and take away your destructiveness. Meditation will bring your compassion and will take away your cruelty. Meditation will make you responsible to your own being and then you cannot be a criminal.\nTo be a criminal needs great unconsciousness. Meditation destroys your unconsciousness, opens the doors of light and suddenly what you were doing in the darkness starts disappearing.\nA civilization can be based only on meditation. The only people who have been civilized were people who were in touch with their own being: a Gautam Buddha, a Socrates, a Pythagoras, a Lao\nTzu; these people are civilized. Only individuals once in a while have been found civilized, but the collective mass is still far below the standard of civilization.\nIt has to happen!\nAnd Milarepa, those who are with me, they have to create the foundation for a civilization, for a civilized humanity, by becoming themselves civilized.\nIt was the night before the wedding, and young Herschel Goldberg is having a drink with Moishe Finkelstein, his future father-in-law.\nSoon the conversation turns to Ruthie, the bride-to-be.\n“Well,” says Moishe, a little the worse for drink, “are you going to be a man and do it tonight, or are you going to be a mouse and wait until tomorrow night?”\nBefore he can stop himself, Herschel blurts out, “I guess I am a rat, sir – I did it last week.” These are your civilized people.\nOn honeymoon, the young French bride is becoming exhausted by her ardent eighty-year-old husband. During a short lull, while he is shaving, she sneaks out and staggers into the hotel coffee- shop downstairs.\n“I don’t get it,” says her friend, the waitress. “Here you are, a teenage bride with an ancient husband, and you look a wreck. What happened?”\n“The old goat double-crossed me,” sobs the bride. “He told me he had been saving up for sixty years, and I thought he was talking about money!”\nJust look around, look at people’s behavior and you will be surprised. This idea that we have become civilized is very dangerous. It is preventing us from being civilized, because once you accept that you are civilized there is no need to work for civilization. Once you accept you are healthy, there is no need to remove any sickness that you may be suffering from. The first thing to be recognized is that you are sick! Then only can something be done for your health. But if you deny sickness, which has been done for centuries by your so-called politicians ... They deny that we are uncivilized people, they say we are civilized people.\nAnd this camouflage prevents us from being civilized. We have completely accepted the idea and forgotten that we have to see whether it is true or not. It is certainly not true. Unless each man comes to the consciousness of a Gautam Buddha, there is no question of civilization.\nAfter I left America, the U.S. attorney for Oregon gave a press conference in which he was asked, “Why have you let Osho go – and not jailed him?”\nAnd the U.S. attorney said, “There are three reasons: one, our priority was to destroy his commune and we could not destroy it if we had not deported him.”\nBut why should they be interested in destroying the commune? The commune was not hurting anybody. It was the most civilized group of people in the whole world. Five thousand people living for five years together in a desert, with no rape, no madness, no stealing, no murder, no suicide. And people were so happy and so joyous. Why was the U.S. attorney interested in destroying the commune? In fact the commune became a pain in their neck. They could see what is possible. No court, no laws, no army, no police and yet five thousand people are living peacefully, lovingly, understandingly.\nThis was hurting the politicians of America, because soon people would start comparing: “Why is it not happening all over America?” That was their number one priority – to destroy the commune.\n“Second,” he said, “we did not want Osho to become a martyr.”\nIt implies that they had the intention to murder me, but they were afraid that murdering me would mean creating a new Christianity.\nIf the Jews had not crucified Jesus there would not have been any Christianity at all. That’s why I never like to call it Christianity. I call it Crossianity. It has nothing to do with Jesus, it has everything to do with the cross. And you can see that cross hanging around the necks of all the missionaries and the bishops and the cardinals and the priests and the pope. The cross is the center. Anyway Christ was a Jew! And he always remained a Jew. He had never even heard the word ‘Christian’. He died a Jew. But the cross created a great sympathy towards him.\nThat was the fear, that if they assassinate me, the danger is that sannyas will become a far more solid movement around the world.\nBut there was every desire, otherwise he would not have mentioned it. Whatever you say shows not what you are saying but what is hidden behind it. Mentioning that, “We did not want Osho to become a martyr,” shows the desire that if it had been possible without making me a martyr they would have certainly preferred to assassinate me. But he said, “We will do everything to silence him.”\nAnd they did everything to silence me. Twenty-four countries they influenced not to allow me in their territories. The Indian government is under their pressure, making every effort ... They cannot do anything to me, but they can do one thing: they can ensure that no news media reaches me, that no seekers from outside India reach me. They are making all kinds of efforts to prevent people coming to me. Naturally I will be silenced. It will be equivalent to killing me without a cross.\nAnd the third thing is the most interesting that he said. He said, “Moreover Osho has not committed any crime; we don’t have any proof, we don’t have any evidence.”\nThis recognition by the U.S. attorney for Oregon ... and still I was fined four hundred thousand dollars! They don’t have any proof and they don’t have any evidence, they don’t think I have committed any crime. For what have I been fined? And they know perfectly well, I don’t have a single dollar. I have not touched money for almost thirty-five years!\nPerhaps they were hoping that because I don’t have any possessions ... how was I going to pay? Almost half a million dollars! So naturally, if I could not pay them they would have an excuse to put me in jail for at least twenty years, thirty years.\nAnd you call this world a civilized world? And for what did they deport me? They did not allow me even to stay a single night! I was ordered from the court directly to the airport; my jet was ready, its engine was kept running. “You move out of America immediately.”\nWhat was the problem? Why could I not stay at least for the night? The reason was they were afraid I might appeal to the higher court, I might go up to the Supreme Court. It was better to throw me out of America, so I could not do that.\nAnd this is a civilized world! And America is very proud of its civilization. Absolutely innocent people are being tortured. Thirty million people in America are beggars. They are just on the street, with no food, no shelter, no clothes; they don’t know from where they are going to get their food tomorrow. And exactly the same number – a strange coincidence – thirty million Americans are suffering from too much weight. They are looked after in the hospitals, because they cannot be left alone in their houses. Devageet was right that in the middle of the night they empty the fridge.\nThirty million people are dying of overfeeding and thirty million people are dying without food. Is this civilization? Can’t a simple understanding be there: “Don’t eat too much and what remains can save thirty million people?” Not eating too much is going to save the other thirty million who are dying of starvation. As they go on eating, sixty million people are unnecessarily dying.\nYou call this an intelligent world, a civilized world, a cultured world? No, I refuse! A hundred times NO! This world is not yet civilized. It needs civilization, certainly. But up to now no effort has been made to civilize it.\nAnd strange things go on happening. I have been continuously receiving letters from sannyasins from all over the world that they want to come, but the moment they mention ‘meditation’, that they are going to India for meditation, the Indian embassies refuse them. They say, “India is not for meditation.” And for almost ten thousand years India has been the center of meditation, and pilgrims from all over the world have always moved towards India in search of meditation.\nNow who are these idiots who are preventing people from coming to India because they want to learn meditation? They are allowing people who want to see the ruins of old forts, castles, caves. That’s perfectly okay, you are a tourist. But if you are going to learn meditation, you are not to be allowed.\nThe fear is that if you are going to learn meditation you will end up in Poona. And this is the only effort which is being made on a large scale around the world to make people civilized. But no politician wants people to be civilized. No country wants people to be civilized. They want a pretense, a hypocrisy, but not a deeper transformation.\nWe have to create that revolt around the world. It is not against anybody, it is against your own false ideas, your false personality, your masks. You have to discover your original face, you have to discover your authenticity and you will be creating a small energy field. Whoever comes close to you will feel the flavor of civilization, of culture, of humanness, and if you go really deep into your being you can radiate something which is the only argument and the only proof that the world is not dead, that it is alive, it is intelligent, it is divine.\nAll religions should disappear from the world. Only religiousness is enough. And religiousness need not be organized: it is each individual’s communion with the universe. There is no need of Christians or Hindus or Mohammedans. There is only need of religious people, seekers, lovers of meditation, dropping all their masks, courageous enough to expose their original face to the world.\nWhen the world has its original face, it will be a civilized world, Milarepa, not before that. Okay, Maneesha?\nYes, Osho.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"5561","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/sat_chit_anand/part27/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/sat_chit_anand/>Sat Chit Anand</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">27 Crossianity</h1><div class=post-meta>27 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;5561 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Sat_Chit_Anand/part27.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part26>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

BUT FOR TEN YEARS, WHENEVER I SEE YOU ENTERING THE AUDITORIUM, THERE IS
THIS SURPRISE ABOUT YOUR UNBELIEVABLE OUTER BEAUTY TOO.</p><p><br></p><p>OSHO, IS THE OUTER APPEARANCE ALWAYS JUST A REFLECTION OF THE
INNER?</p><p><br></p><p>Pragito, the outer beauty comes from a different source than the
inner. The outer beauty comes from your father and mother: their bodies
create your body. But the inner beauty comes from your own growth of
consciousness that you are carrying from many lives.</p><p><br></p><p>In your individuality both are joined, the physical heritage from
your father and mother and the spiritual heritage of your own past
lives, its consciousness, its bliss, its joy.</p><p><br></p><p>So it is not absolutely necessary that the outer will be a reflection
of the inner, nor will vice versa be true, that the inner will
correspond with the outer.</p><p><br></p><p>But sometimes it happens that your inner beauty is so much, your
inner light is so much that it starts radiating from your outer body.
Your outer body may not be beautiful, but the light that comes from your
sources, your innermost sources of eternal life, will make even a body
which is not beautiful in the ordinary sense appear beautiful,
radiant.</p><p>But vice versa it is never true. Your outer beauty is only skin-deep.
It cannot affect your inner beauty. On the contrary the outer beauty
becomes a hindrance in search of the inner: you become too identified
with the outer. Who is going to look for the inner sources? Most often
it happens that the people who are outwardly very beautiful, are
inwardly very ugly. Their outer beauty becomes a cover-up to hide
themselves behind, and it is experienced by millions of people every
day. You fall in love with a woman or a man, because you can see only
the outer. And just within a few days you start discovering his inner
state; it doesn’t correspond to his outer beauty. On the contrary it is
very ugly.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, Alexander the Great had a very beautiful body but he
killed millions of people, just to fulfill his ego that he is the world
conqueror. He met one man, Diogenes, when he was on his way to India,
who lived naked, the only man in Greece who did, unique in a way. His
beauty was tremendous, not just the outer, but the inner radiance was so
much and so dazzling that even Alexander had to stop his armies when he
was close by in a forest near a river. He stopped the armies and went to
see Diogenes alone; alone, because he did not want anybody to know that
there exists a man who is far more beautiful than Alexander himself.</p><p><br></p><p>It was early morning and Diogenes was taking a sunbath, naked on the
riverbank. Alexander could not believe that a beggar ... He had nothing,
no possessions – even Buddha used to have a begging bowl, but that too
Diogenes had thrown away. He was absolutely without any possessions,
exactly as he was born, naked.</p><p><br></p><p>Alexander could not believe his eyes. He had never seen such a
beautiful personality and he could see that this beauty was not just on
the outer side. Something infiltrated from the inner; a subtle
radiation, a subtle aura surrounded him. All around him there was a
fragrance, a silence.</p><p><br></p><p>If the inner becomes beautiful – which is in your hands – the outer
will have to mold itself according to the inner. The outer is not
essential, it will have to reflect the inner in some way.</p><p><br></p><p>But the converse is not true at all. You can have plastic surgery,
you can have a beautiful face, beautiful eyes, a beautiful nose; you can
change your skin; you can change your shape. That is not going to change
your being. Inside you will still remain greedy, full of lust, violence,
anger, rage, jealousy, with a tremendous will to power. All these things
the plastic surgeon can do nothing about.</p><p><br></p><p>For that you will need a different kind of surgery. It is happening
here: you are on the table. As you become more and more meditative,
peaceful, a deep at-onement with existence happens. You fall into the
rhythm of the universe. The universe also has its own heartbeat. Your
heartbeat, once it starts in rhythm with the universal heartbeat, will
have transformed your being from that ugly stage of animality, into
authentic humanity.</p><p><br></p><p>And even the human is not the end. You can go on searching deeper and
there is a place where you transcend humanity and something of the
divine enters in you. Once the divine is there, it is almost like a
light in a dark house. The windows will start showing the light; even
the cracks in the wall or the roof or the doors will start showing the
inner light.</p><p><br></p><p>The inner is tremendously powerful, the outer is very weak. The inner
is eternal, the outer is very temporary. How many years do you remain
young? And as youth fades away you start feeling that</p><p>you are becoming ugly, unless your inner being is also growing with
your age. Then even in your old age you will have a beauty that the
youth may feel jealous of.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember, from the inner the change to the outer happens, but I am
not making it inevitable. Most often it happens, but sometimes the outer
is in such a rotten state that even the inner radiation cannot change
it.</p><p><br></p><p>There have been cases on record: one very great mystic of India – I
have spoken on him for almost half a year continuously. His name was
Ashtavakra. And what he has written is tremendously important; each
sentence has so many dimensions to be explored, but the man himself was
in a very difficult situation.</p><p><br></p><p>Ashtavakra – the name was given to him, because he was almost like a
camel. In eight places he was distorted in the body – one leg was
longer, one arm was shorter, his back was bent – in eight places he was
distorted. That’s how he was born, with a crippled, distorted body. But
even in a crippled and distorted body the soul is as beautiful as in the
most beautiful body.</p><p><br></p><p>He became enlightened, but his body was too rigid to change with his
inner change. His eyes started showing something of the beauty, but the
whole body was in such a mess.</p><p><br></p><p>The story is that the emperor of India in those days was Janak and he
was very much interested in philosophical discussions. Each year he used
to call a big conference of all the scholars, philosophers, theologians
or whoever wanted to participate. It was a championship competition.</p><p><br></p><p>One very famous philosopher, Yagnavalkya came a little late. The
conference had started and he saw standing outside one thousand
beautiful cows. Their horns were covered with gold and diamonds. This
was going to be the prize for the champion. It was a hot day and the
cows were perspiring.</p><p><br></p><p>He told his disciples, “You take these cows. As far as winning the
competition is concerned, I am certain. Why should the cows suffer here?
You take them to our place.” They had their own place in the forest.</p><p><br></p><p>Even Janak could not prevent him, because he knew that he had been
the champion continuously for five years, and he would be the champion
this time, because there was nobody else who could defeat him. It is not
right to take the reward before you have won, but his victory was so
certain to everybody that nobody objected. And his disciples took away
all the cows.</p><p><br></p><p>While Yagnavalkya was discussing, a very unknown scholar was also
present in the conference. Ashtavakra was this unknown philosopher’s
son. His mother was waiting for her husband to come home. It was getting
late and the meal was getting cold. So she sent Ashtavakra to bring his
father home, because he could not win the competition. Why should he
unnecessarily waste his time? He was a poor scholar and there were great
scholars there. Ashtavakra went. There were at least one thousand people
in the conference, the highly cultured and sophisticated scholars of the
country.</p><p><br></p><p>As Ashtavakra entered, looking at his distorted body they all started
laughing. But Ashtavakra was a man of tremendous integrity. As they
started laughing, he laughed even louder. Because of his loud laugh they
stopped. They could not believe that he was laughing.</p><p>Janak asked him, “I can understand why they are laughing – because of
your body; but I cannot understand why you are laughing. And you stopped
all their laughing with your laughter.” A single man stopped one
thousand people’s laughter.</p><p><br></p><p>Ashtavakra said to Janak, “I thought this conference was for scholars
and philosophers, but these are all shoemakers. They can understand only
the skin. They cannot see the inner, they can only see the outer.”</p><p><br></p><p>There was a great silence. What he was saying had a great truth in
it. Janak dissolved the conference and said, “Now I would like to
inquire of Ashtavakra only. He has defeated you all just by his laughter
and his statement that, ‘You can’t see the inner, you can only see the
outer; you are all shoemakers.’ Shoemakers work with the skin of
different animals. I dissolve the conference and, Yagnavalka, return
those one thousand cows, because you also laughed. And when Ashtavakra
laughed, you also stopped!”</p><p><br></p><p>It was a very strange situation; it had never happened before. And
then began the long inquiry of Janak, the emperor. He asked questions
and Ashtavakra answered them. Each answer in itself carried so much
meaning and significance.</p><p><br></p><p>Because his body was in such a bad shape he could not get identified
with it. Sometimes blessings come in such disguise. He could not go out,
because wherever he went people would laugh, “Look at that man! Have you
seen anything uglier than this?”</p><p><br></p><p>So most of the time he was in the house, meditating, figuring out,
“Who am I? Certainly I am not this body, because I can be aware of this
body, I can observe this body from within. Certainly that awareness has
to be different from the body.”</p><p><br></p><p>Because of his crippled body he experienced enlightenment. The only
barrier is identification with the body. But he could not identify, the
body was so ugly. He never looked in a mirror; it would have been such a
shock.</p><p><br></p><p>But Yagnavalkya had to return those one thousand cows to Ashtavakra’s
house. He was young and he defeated one thousand old philosophers,
well-versed in the ancient scriptures.</p><p><br></p><p>It is one of the strangest things in this country that on every book
written by any prominent mystic there have been hundreds of
commentaries, but nobody has commented before me on Ashtavakra. And he
must be at least five thousand years old. For five thousand years nobody
has bothered to look into his statements, which are so significant.</p><p><br></p><p>But his inner enlightenment, his inner understanding could not change
his outer appearance. And yet for those who are going deeper into
themselves, the outer does not matter. They would have seen even in
Ashtavakra tremendous beauty, but it would not have been of the outer
circumference, but of the center.</p><p><br></p><p>Most often the inner change changes the outer, if the outer is not
too rigid. But the outer never changes the inner.</p><p>You need to have eyes, going deep into people’s beings, which is
possible only if you are going inwards yourself. The deeper you go into
yourself the deeper you can look into other people’s beings. And then a
totally new world opens its doors.</p><p><br></p><p>Flanagan is on his deathbed and Father Murphy has come to give him
the last rites. “Open your eyes,” says the priest. “We have got to save
your immortal soul.” Flanagan opens one eye, closes it and tries to doze
off. He is having such a nice snooze.</p><p><br></p><p>“Come on now!” says Father Murphy. “If you don’t want to confess, at
least answer me this: do you renounce the devil and all his works?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, I don’t know,” says Flanagan, opening one eye again. “At a
time like this it doesn’t seem very smart to upset anyone.”</p><p><br></p><p>The inner comes out, you cannot hide it much. Now he is being very
calculating. At the time of death, unnecessarily annoying anybody ...
and who knows where you are going? It is better to keep silent.</p><p><br></p><p>A wealthy widower and his beautiful daughter are on a sea cruise. By
chance the girl falls overboard, and Rubin Fingelbaum, aged seventy,
splashes in afterwards and rescues her. After the two are brought on
board the ship, the widower throws his arms around Rubin.</p><p><br></p><p>“You saved my daughter’s life,” he cries. “I’m a rich man – I will
give you anything! Ask for whatever you want!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Just answer me one question,” replies Rubin. “Who pushed me?” What
is inside is bound to come outside.</p><p>How can you hide it?</p><p><br></p><p>An old black preacher had used the letters B.S., M.S. and Ph.D. after
his name for many years without ever having had anyone from his
congregation ask what they meant. Finally a nosey old woman questions
him about it.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, sister,” he answers. “You know what B.S. stands for, don’t
you?” “I sure do,” says the lady indignantly. “Bull shit!”</p><p>“Right,” says the preacher. “And M.S. just means more of the same,
and Ph.D. means piled high and deep.”</p><p><br></p><p>That’s the inner side of most people: bull shit, B.S.; M.S., more of
the same; and Ph.D., piled high and deep.</p><p><br></p><p>No plastic surgeon can change it. But you are capable of changing it
yourself. It is within your hands. Nobody can do anything about your
inner being except you. You are the master of your inner world.</p><p>And as the inner world becomes silent, naturally your eyes become
deeper, with an oceanic depth. As your inner being becomes cloudless
your face also becomes cloudless, just an open sky. As your inner being
comes to discover the source of your life, the flame of your life,
something of that flame starts radiating from every pore of your
body.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the rule. Ashtavakra is an exception. Exceptions don’t make
the rule, they only prove the rule. But it has never happened vice versa
before, and I don’t think it can ever happen.</p><p><br></p><p>We are all trying to be beautiful on the outside: all kinds of
make-up, all kinds of things are going on to make your outer
beautiful.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard ...</p><p><br></p><p>A man was catching flies. Finally after two or three hours’ effort he
caught four flies. He told his wife, “I have caught four flies: two are
male, two are female.”</p><p><br></p><p>The wife said, “My God, how did you figure out who is male and who is
female?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Easy! Two were sitting for almost two hours on the mirror
and two were for two hours reading the newspaper!”</p><p><br></p><p>We are so much identified with the periphery of our being that we
have forgotten that the periphery does not exist in itself. There must
be a center inside. And the search for the center is the only religious
search – not for God, not for heaven, not for any rewards for your
virtues, not to avoid hell and punishment.</p><p><br></p><p>There is only one authentic religious search and that is to know your
innermost being. It is the being of the whole universe. By entering your
innermost temple you have entered the real temple. All other temples are
false, man-manufactured; all other gods in those temples are false, they
are man-manufactured.</p><p><br></p><p>Only one thing is not man-manufactured and that is your innermost
dignity, your innermost grace. That grace starts flooding your outer
being too. And that grace transforms not only the inner, but gives a new
look to your outer being: an innocence, a serenity, a depth, a peace, a
love, and these are all flowers blossoming around you. Then even your
periphery becomes so beautiful, so musical, such a dance of rejoicing
...</p><p><br></p><p>But you should start from the inner. Question 2</p><p>BELOVED OSHO, WHAT IS CIVILIZATION?</p><p>Milarepa, civilization has not happened yet. It is a false idea that
we are civilized people – civilized people and continuously preparing
for war?</p><p>Even the animals don’t eat, don’t kill their own species. It is only
man who kills his own species – no lion will kill another lion, no dog
will kill another dog. No lion will eat another lion. Man is the only
one who can be a cannibal. There are still small groups around the world
in isolated places who are cannibals. They are remnants of the past, but
they are still there.</p><p><br></p><p>In Africa there is a small cannibal colony in the thick forest. There
used to be three thousand at the beginning of this century; now they are
only three hundred because, when they cannot find anybody else, they
have to eat somebody from their own group. They are getting reduced in
numbers – they eat their own children, they eat their own parents. Once
in a while they get a Christian missionary, but that is very rare.</p><p><br></p><p>Once they caught a very fat Christian missionary and they were
immensely happy. There was dancing and celebration, a big pot on the
fire was boiling and the Christian missionary asked, “What is this
celebration for? I have come here to give you a taste of
Christianity.”</p><p><br></p><p>They said, “You wait, soon we will have the first taste of
Christianity.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “How are you going to have the first taste of Christianity
if I don’t give it to you?” They said, “Don’t be worried, you will have
to give it.”</p><p>He said, “I don’t understand what you are talking about.”</p><p><br></p><p>They said, “Look at that fire and the big pot. We will put you in the
pot. When the water is hot enough, we will make a soup of you and that
will be our first taste of Christianity!”</p><p><br></p><p>Once perhaps the whole of humanity was cannibal.</p><p><br></p><p>In emergency situations one falls back. For example, when there was a
famine in Bengal, people were found eating their own children. You
cannot conceive it, but rather than die it seems to be logical and
rational to eat your own children. Those who were not able to do such a
thing sold their children, knowing perfectly well that the people who
were purchasing their children would eat them. And with the money they
purchased other people’s children. This way they protected their
conscience a little bit, but not much, because it was absolutely clear
what was going to happen.</p><p><br></p><p>In emergency situations man shows his real face; otherwise our
civilization is only a mask.</p><p><br></p><p>In a civilized humanity a few things are absolutely necessary. One:
there should be no possibility of war because it is life-destructive.
And a civilized humanity will have the sensitivity not to destroy life
in any form.</p><p><br></p><p>George Bernard Shaw had around his house a beautiful garden where he
had collected exotic roses from different countries, different colors,
different fragrances. A friend had come to see him and he saw the roses.
He could not believe that there were so many colors and so many
different fragrances. When he went inside he asked Bernard Shaw, “You
have such beautiful flowers, but you don’t put them in a flowerpot
inside your sitting room?”</p><p>Bernard Shaw said, “I am a civilized man. I love children, but that
does not mean I should cut off their heads and decorate my sitting room
with them. I love roses, but that does not mean that I have to cut the
living flower from its life source and put it here in my sitting room.
That would be uncivilized behavior.”</p><p><br></p><p>Even to cut a flower is uncivilized behavior, what to say about
people like Genghis Khan, who killed forty million people; Tamerlane,
who killed thirty million people; Nadir Shah, he again killed forty
million people, and statistics are not available about many others.
Alexander the Great, Napoleon Bonaparte, Ivan the Terrible ... no data
is available, but they must have killed more people than Genghis Khan,
Tamerlane, Nadir Shah. Data is available on Joseph Stalin, Adolf Hitler,
Benito Mussolini, and they were not very far away from our present time,
just forty years ago. They killed millions of people for no reason at
all.</p><p><br></p><p>This destructiveness is a death-oriented ideology and it is so deeply
rooted in our minds that it keeps us below the animals.</p><p><br></p><p>Man, Milarepa, is not yet civilized. His civilization will begin by
dropping war, by dropping nations. What is the need of nations if you
are not going to fight? Nations are needed for wars. Why create these
stupid lines on the map of the world?</p><p><br></p><p>The world is one. There are no natural lines dividing nations. Then
why do you go on? There is a deep desire to dominate and there are so
many people in the world to dominate: they need many nations. Otherwise
just a single government, a functional government for the whole world
will be enough.</p><p><br></p><p>What is the need of so many laws, if man is civilized? What is the
need of so many courts, jails, so many legal advisers, if man is
civilized? A civilized man will not commit murders, a civilized man will
not rape women ... but we keep this whole paraphernalia of courts, laws,
constitutions, legal experts; for whom?</p><p><br></p><p>Man is still a criminal. And these jails, these judges and these laws
prevent nothing. Jails go on growing, judges go on increasing – more and
more of them; more courts, more legal experts, thousands of colleges
around the world producing legal experts every year. But even they
cannot manage, for the criminals increase at a faster rate, and they
don’t have a college, they are not educated.</p><p><br></p><p>Something is basically wrong, something is missing. What is missing?
I call it meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>Only meditation can make humanity civilized, because meditation will
release your creativity and take away your destructiveness. Meditation
will bring your compassion and will take away your cruelty. Meditation
will make you responsible to your own being and then you cannot be a
criminal.</p><p><br></p><p>To be a criminal needs great unconsciousness. Meditation destroys
your unconsciousness, opens the doors of light and suddenly what you
were doing in the darkness starts disappearing.</p><p><br></p><p>A civilization can be based only on meditation. The only people who
have been civilized were people who were in touch with their own being:
a Gautam Buddha, a Socrates, a Pythagoras, a Lao</p><p>Tzu; these people are civilized. Only individuals once in a while
have been found civilized, but the collective mass is still far below
the standard of civilization.</p><p><br></p><p>It has to happen!</p><p><br></p><p>And Milarepa, those who are with me, they have to create the
foundation for a civilization, for a civilized humanity, by becoming
themselves civilized.</p><p><br></p><p>It was the night before the wedding, and young Herschel Goldberg is
having a drink with Moishe Finkelstein, his future father-in-law.</p><p><br></p><p>Soon the conversation turns to Ruthie, the bride-to-be.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well,” says Moishe, a little the worse for drink, “are you going to
be a man and do it tonight, or are you going to be a mouse and wait
until tomorrow night?”</p><p><br></p><p>Before he can stop himself, Herschel blurts out, “I guess I am a rat,
sir – I did it last week.” These are your civilized people.</p><p>On honeymoon, the young French bride is becoming exhausted by her
ardent eighty-year-old husband. During a short lull, while he is
shaving, she sneaks out and staggers into the hotel coffee- shop
downstairs.</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t get it,” says her friend, the waitress. “Here you are, a
teenage bride with an ancient husband, and you look a wreck. What
happened?”</p><p><br></p><p>“The old goat double-crossed me,” sobs the bride. “He told me he had
been saving up for sixty years, and I thought he was talking about
money!”</p><p><br></p><p>Just look around, look at people’s behavior and you will be
surprised. This idea that we have become civilized is very dangerous. It
is preventing us from being civilized, because once you accept that you
are civilized there is no need to work for civilization. Once you accept
you are healthy, there is no need to remove any sickness that you may be
suffering from. The first thing to be recognized is that you are sick!
Then only can something be done for your health. But if you deny
sickness, which has been done for centuries by your so-called
politicians ... They deny that we are uncivilized people, they say we
are civilized people.</p><p><br></p><p>And this camouflage prevents us from being civilized. We have
completely accepted the idea and forgotten that we have to see whether
it is true or not. It is certainly not true. Unless each man comes to
the consciousness of a Gautam Buddha, there is no question of
civilization.</p><p><br></p><p>After I left America, the U.S. attorney for Oregon gave a press
conference in which he was asked, “Why have you let Osho go – and not
jailed him?”</p><p><br></p><p>And the U.S. attorney said, “There are three reasons: one, our
priority was to destroy his commune and we could not destroy it if we
had not deported him.”</p><p>But why should they be interested in destroying the commune? The
commune was not hurting anybody. It was the most civilized group of
people in the whole world. Five thousand people living for five years
together in a desert, with no rape, no madness, no stealing, no murder,
no suicide. And people were so happy and so joyous. Why was the U.S.
attorney interested in destroying the commune? In fact the commune
became a pain in their neck. They could see what is possible. No court,
no laws, no army, no police and yet five thousand people are living
peacefully, lovingly, understandingly.</p><p><br></p><p>This was hurting the politicians of America, because soon people
would start comparing: “Why is it not happening all over America?” That
was their number one priority – to destroy the commune.</p><p><br></p><p>“Second,” he said, “we did not want Osho to become a martyr.”</p><p><br></p><p>It implies that they had the intention to murder me, but they were
afraid that murdering me would mean creating a new Christianity.</p><p><br></p><p>If the Jews had not crucified Jesus there would not have been any
Christianity at all. That’s why I never like to call it Christianity. I
call it Crossianity. It has nothing to do with Jesus, it has everything
to do with the cross. And you can see that cross hanging around the
necks of all the missionaries and the bishops and the cardinals and the
priests and the pope. The cross is the center. Anyway Christ was a Jew!
And he always remained a Jew. He had never even heard the word
‘Christian’. He died a Jew. But the cross created a great sympathy
towards him.</p><p><br></p><p>That was the fear, that if they assassinate me, the danger is that
sannyas will become a far more solid movement around the world.</p><p><br></p><p>But there was every desire, otherwise he would not have mentioned it.
Whatever you say shows not what you are saying but what is hidden behind
it. Mentioning that, “We did not want Osho to become a martyr,” shows
the desire that if it had been possible without making me a martyr they
would have certainly preferred to assassinate me. But he said, “We will
do everything to silence him.”</p><p><br></p><p>And they did everything to silence me. Twenty-four countries they
influenced not to allow me in their territories. The Indian government
is under their pressure, making every effort ... They cannot do anything
to me, but they can do one thing: they can ensure that no news media
reaches me, that no seekers from outside India reach me. They are making
all kinds of efforts to prevent people coming to me. Naturally I will be
silenced. It will be equivalent to killing me without a cross.</p><p><br></p><p>And the third thing is the most interesting that he said. He said,
“Moreover Osho has not committed any crime; we don’t have any proof, we
don’t have any evidence.”</p><p><br></p><p>This recognition by the U.S. attorney for Oregon ... and still I was
fined four hundred thousand dollars! They don’t have any proof and they
don’t have any evidence, they don’t think I have committed any crime.
For what have I been fined? And they know perfectly well, I don’t have a
single dollar. I have not touched money for almost thirty-five
years!</p><p><br></p><p>Perhaps they were hoping that because I don’t have any possessions
... how was I going to pay? Almost half a million dollars! So naturally,
if I could not pay them they would have an excuse to put me in jail for
at least twenty years, thirty years.</p><p>And you call this world a civilized world? And for what did they
deport me? They did not allow me even to stay a single night! I was
ordered from the court directly to the airport; my jet was ready, its
engine was kept running. “You move out of America immediately.”</p><p><br></p><p>What was the problem? Why could I not stay at least for the night?
The reason was they were afraid I might appeal to the higher court, I
might go up to the Supreme Court. It was better to throw me out of
America, so I could not do that.</p><p><br></p><p>And this is a civilized world! And America is very proud of its
civilization. Absolutely innocent people are being tortured. Thirty
million people in America are beggars. They are just on the street, with
no food, no shelter, no clothes; they don’t know from where they are
going to get their food tomorrow. And exactly the same number – a
strange coincidence – thirty million Americans are suffering from too
much weight. They are looked after in the hospitals, because they cannot
be left alone in their houses. Devageet was right that in the middle of
the night they empty the fridge.</p><p><br></p><p>Thirty million people are dying of overfeeding and thirty million
people are dying without food. Is this civilization? Can’t a simple
understanding be there: “Don’t eat too much and what remains can save
thirty million people?” Not eating too much is going to save the other
thirty million who are dying of starvation. As they go on eating, sixty
million people are unnecessarily dying.</p><p><br></p><p>You call this an intelligent world, a civilized world, a cultured
world? No, I refuse! A hundred times NO! This world is not yet
civilized. It needs civilization, certainly. But up to now no effort has
been made to civilize it.</p><p><br></p><p>And strange things go on happening. I have been continuously
receiving letters from sannyasins from all over the world that they want
to come, but the moment they mention ‘meditation’, that they are going
to India for meditation, the Indian embassies refuse them. They say,
“India is not for meditation.” And for almost ten thousand years India
has been the center of meditation, and pilgrims from all over the world
have always moved towards India in search of meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>Now who are these idiots who are preventing people from coming to
India because they want to learn meditation? They are allowing people
who want to see the ruins of old forts, castles, caves. That’s perfectly
okay, you are a tourist. But if you are going to learn meditation, you
are not to be allowed.</p><p><br></p><p>The fear is that if you are going to learn meditation you will end up
in Poona. And this is the only effort which is being made on a large
scale around the world to make people civilized. But no politician wants
people to be civilized. No country wants people to be civilized. They
want a pretense, a hypocrisy, but not a deeper transformation.</p><p><br></p><p>We have to create that revolt around the world. It is not against
anybody, it is against your own false ideas, your false personality,
your masks. You have to discover your original face, you have to
discover your authenticity and you will be creating a small energy
field. Whoever comes close to you will feel the flavor of civilization,
of culture, of humanness, and if you go really deep into your being you
can radiate something which is the only argument and the only proof that
the world is not dead, that it is alive, it is intelligent, it is
divine.</p><p>All religions should disappear from the world. Only religiousness is
enough. And religiousness need not be organized: it is each individual’s
communion with the universe. There is no need of Christians or Hindus or
Mohammedans. There is only need of religious people, seekers, lovers of
meditation, dropping all their masks, courageous enough to expose their
original face to the world.</p><p><br></p><p>When the world has its original face, it will be a civilized world,
Milarepa, not before that. Okay, Maneesha?</p><p>Yes, Osho.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part26>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

BOTH KRISHNAMURTI AND GURDJIEFF WERE TALKING ABOUT THEIR WAVES OF CONSCIOUSNESS.\nBELOVED MASTER, ARE THEY THE WAVES OF YOUR OCEAN?\nShridhar, J. Krishnamurti and George Gurdjieff are not just two waves in the ocean of consciousness. They are the very ocean of consciousness itself. The moment you become enlightened you are no longer an individual. You lose your ego, and with the ego you lose all your limits, all your boundaries. They are not waves of my ocean; the ocean belongs to no one. I am the same ocean as they are.\nYou are also the same ocean as I am. You just have to wake up and realize the fact that your imprisonment is your imagination, that your fetters are nothing but your thoughts, that your bondage is nothing but your own unconscious way of living. Otherwise you are as oceanic as any Gautam Buddha, as any Lao Tzu, as any Kabir, as anyone who has ever realized his ultimate, his sachchidanand.\nWe are not separate. We belong to one existence without any demarcation lines. All limitations are mind projections. The moment you are beyond mind and you can see without the mind directly, you will be surprised that the trees and the stars and the oceans ... There is nowhere any demarcation.\nThe flowers of the trees are your flowers, the greatness of the stars is your greatness, and the smallness of the grass leaves is your smallness. The moment you start feeling this universalness, you have come home.\nBut remember always not to put me above anybody else, just because I am your master. So don’t say that I am the ocean and J. Krishnamurti and Gurdjieff are just waves. That is ugly.\nYou may not be aware from where these kinds of ideas continuously come. And this is not only the case with you ...\nJust today, Hasya was telling me about some Korean master, Su. He is going to come soon. He has disciples. Lani has just come from Korea. In the Korean language they have published more than thirty-five books of mine. Hundreds of people are interested in coming. They were not even aware where I am, and whether I am still alive or some past master.\nNot only the so-called disciples go on praising their master as the highest. Even the so-called masters ... certainly they are not masters, just so-called. When master Su’s disciples asked him, “What are the categories between you and Bhagwan?” he said he belongs to the first category of enlightened people and Bhagwan belongs to the third category of enlightened people.\nNow such a man cannot be enlightened, to say nothing of first, second and third category, because there are no categories in enlightenment. How can you be enlightened and still belong to a certain category? The category is a limitation.\nBut the so-called masters will always put themselves higher than anybody else. The ego lingers on, whether you are in the world of matter, money, power, prestige or whether you are pretending to be a seeker, a searcher, a spiritual being. Even when you start declaring yourself as enlightened you are playing the same old game with new names. There is no difference at all.\nI am waiting for master Su to come. He is going to be in trouble! He does not know me. In the first class enlightened category ... Why should a master who belongs to the first class come to a third class enlightened man in the first place? This is strange! So let him come. He will have to stand in line for the first time in his life.\nOnce you are enlightened there are no categories. Enlightenment simply means going beyond all categories, all mind trips, all ego trips. It is simply becoming one with the universe.\nThe reason for people like master Su is the simple pious ego, now acting in the name of spirituality. The game is old: one has to be on the top. But why do the disciples do this? The reason is the same. If I am the greatest master, then naturally – you are my disciple – you are the disciple of the greatest master. You are no ordinary disciple, you are not a disciple of a third class enlightened man!\nI have told you about one religious cult that exists only around the area of the Taj Mahal. They are called Radhaswamis. They were very much disturbed by the presence of the Taj Mahal. Now the Taj Mahal has nothing to do with their spirituality. But the disturbance began when their master died – they determined to make his memorial better than the Taj Mahal.\nThe Taj Mahal is unique in the whole world, there is no other building that can be compared to it. And it was made by a great emperor. It took thirty years in building, and almost ten thousand stonecutters, sculptors ... Master builders were gathered from faraway countries, the best from Iran, from Turkey, from Egypt, from Arabia. And the emperor who was making it had the whole empire of India and all the money was pouring into it.\nThese ten thousand people worked almost ... When they had come they were young; by the time the Taj Mahal was completed, either they were old or dead. The second generation was working. Sometimes they had come old – they were famous so they were brought – so the third generation was working.\nAnd the emperor who was making it as a memorial to his wife, Mumtaj, was also making on the other side of the river Jamuna his own memorial. When he died he would be buried there. Emperors took care while they were alive to make their memorial too, because after they were dead nobody was going to bother to put so much money and effort into it.\nBut his whole treasure was finished with the wife’s memorial. His own memorial has only the foundation stones. He could not complete it because he was dethroned by his own son and kept in jail. And the son immediately dropped the plan of the second memorial.\nThe Taj Mahal is made of white marble, all Italian marble. And the other memorial, just on the other side of the river – at the end he was going to make a bridge – was going to be exactly the same as the Taj Mahal, but in black marble. He was creating a beautiful symmetry. The architect was going to be exactly the same, the building exactly the same, just the marble was going to be white on the wife’s memorial and black on his own memorial.\nNow these followers wanted to try to make something better than the Taj Mahal, because thousands of tourists were coming every day to see the Taj Mahal. Naturally they thought it was not only a question of prestige, it was also a question of business. It had been going on for almost one hundred years.\nThey had been able to make only the ground floor. Certainly they have made it far better than the Taj Mahal, but there seems to be no possibility that they will be able to complete it. They wanted to make it a three-story building, so it goes higher than the Taj Mahal, but all the money that they could collect from their followers from all over India is finished. For one hundred years continuously thousands of workers have been involved in making it.\nI have seen ... Their pillars are so beautiful, so creative: on the pillars they have made creepers in marble. And the creepers have green flowers of green marble and roses on top of the creepers made in rubies, emeralds, diamonds. They have certainly made it clear that if they complete it – even incomplete – it has gone beyond the Taj Mahal. They are immensely happy. They invited me when I was speaking at Agra University ... They invited me to show me their incomplete memorial. They have done a tremendously great job.\nThey took me inside. Inside they have a map drawn on the marble and on the map there are fourteen divisions. And they have put all the enlightened people that they could think of in the division to which he belongs. There are not only three categories ... According to them there are fourteen.\nMohammed is in the third division, Jesus is in the fifth – so is Moses. In the sixth is Mahavira and Buddha. In the seventh, Kabir, Nanak, and in that way they went on. Names are engraved in marble.\nAnd in the fourteenth there is only one man, their own master, who was not known outside Agra. All his following is centered in Agra. A few people have moved to different places, but basically, it is a one-city-oriented religion. They asked me what was my opinion about this map.\nI said, “Who has made this map?”\nThey said, “It is in our holy scripture. Our master himself has made this.” I said, “Your master is right. He is in the fourteenth.”\nThey looked at me, because before me they had shown that map to many people. Everybody disagreed because their masters were put in the fifth degree, somebody’s master in the third degree, somebody’s master at the most in the seventh. After the seventh, the other six planes are empty. The fourteenth, the highest reach of consciousness, has been achieved by their master. Naturally no Hindu will agree, no Mohammedan will agree, no Jaina will agree, no Jew, no Christian, no Buddhist. Nobody is going to agree. I was the first man to agree with what they said.\nThey said, “You are the only man who understands.”\nI said, “Certainly, because I am on the fifteenth and I know your master is trying, making every effort, to enter into the fifteenth. I don’t allow him! He tries hard, but I don’t open the door. And as long as I am there on the fifteenth – and there is no sixteenth, so I cannot go anywhere else – your master has no chance.”\nThey said, “Fifteenth? But in our scripture there are only fourteen.”\n“I think that’s natural. Your master knows about only fourteen because he has never entered the fifteenth.”\nThey were very much shocked and angry. Their whole desire is that their master is accepted as the highest, then they are certainly the most significant people on the earth, following the greatest master. And the master was also on the same trip because in his own writing, which nobody reads except his own disciples – and they are not many, but they are very rich people ...\nThey showed me their scripture. He has written with his own hand the names of Gautam Buddha and Jesus and Kabir on lower steps, and his own name he has written on the highest. That very stupidity shows that he is not even on the lowest, the first floor. He does not know anything about enlightenment.\nHe may have been a learned scholar. That seems to be a possibility, because he writes well. But he is writing everything as a parrot, repeating from old Indian scriptures. There is not a single statement which is original.\nI asked them, “Show me something that is original. A man who has reached to the highest plane of consciousness must say something which nobody has said, because nobody has reached to that\nplane. Show me something. Because all that is written in it has been said by people who are just on the third, fourth, fifth ... What is your master’s own statement? What is his testimony?”\nThey could not find a single statement in their whole book which was not stolen. But this thing goes on and on.\nThe man who brought me to Poona for the first time, nearabout thirty years ago, was a follower of Mahavira and he was also a follower of Mahatma Gandhi. He lived with Mahatma Gandhi in his ashram for years. His name was Rishabhdas Ranka. Many people of Poona must know him. Because Mahatma Gandhi was teaching continuously that all religions are the same, essentially the same – no religion is higher than the other, they are all equal – he also learned, like a parrot, to repeat it.\nAnd then he wrote a book on Mahavira and Gautam Buddha, and he showed me the manuscript. I simply saw the title and I said to him, “Just look at your title. I don’t have to read your book – your title says everything.” In his title he writes, ‘Bhagwan Mahavir’ and ‘Mahatma Gautam Buddha’. ‘Bhagwan’ is used for Mahavir, and for Gautam Buddha, just ‘Mahatma’. There are so many mahatmas; ‘Mahatma’ is not something very special or unique.\nI said, “You are writing this book to show that Jainism and Buddhism are equal, and their message essentially is the same. And Gautam Buddha and Mahavira are equally enlightened.”\nHe said, “Yes.”\nI said, “Then why this difference? Either put ‘Mahatma’ in front of both the persons or put ‘Bhagwan’.”\nNow he was in a great dilemma. He could not write ‘Mahatma Mahavir’. The Jainas would kill him, they would expel him. He was a Jaina ... Nobody, not a single Jaina in twenty-five centuries, has made such an insult – writing about Mahavira as just a mahatma. Mahatmas are available in this country for one rupee a dozen. They are so cheap, every village has its own mahatma.\nAnd he was not willing to write ‘Bhagwan’ before Gautam Buddha because no Jaina accepts Gautam Buddha as equal to Mahavira. He is enlightened, but not of the same height. Mahavira’s enlightenment is complete; Buddha’s enlightenment is incomplete – partial enlightenment, not total.\nAnd the same is the situation of the Buddhists. They will not be ready to call ... I have asked Buddhist monks. One Buddhist monk was born an Englishman, but got converted when he was young and became a Buddhist monk. I don’t know whether he is still alive or not, but he was a world famous man, Sanghrakshita. He lives in the Himalayas, in Kalimpong.\nHe used to come to the university where I was teaching and he became interested in me, because he was always invited to the Philosophy Department. I used to raise questions and he was in difficulty trying to answer them. But he was a very nice person, he never became angry. On the contrary, if he could not answer me he used to ask if I had some idea of what the answer could be. I said, “I never ask anything unless I know the answer.”\nWe became friends. He even started staying with me while he was in the city. I asked him, “What do you think about Mahavira?” Mahavira and Buddha were contemporaries.\nHe said, “About Mahavira? He was enlightened, but not so completely as Gautam Buddha.”\nThe same nonsense goes on around the world. But the reason the disciples are concerned or the so-called masters are concerned is the same. It is the ego that needs a certain kind of gratification.\nShridhar, as far as J. Krishnamurti and George Gurdjieff are concerned, they are both enlightened. Both have disappeared in the same ocean in which all enlightened people have always disappeared. And beyond enlightenment there is no distinction. There is no question, because the person is no more.\nWhen the dewdrop falls into the ocean, do you think there will be differences, that when another dewdrop falls into the ocean, it will only partially fall into the ocean? Can a dewdrop fall partially into the ocean? Is it possible for any dewdrop to be different from any other dewdrop? They will all become the ocean.\nI am a clear-cut, straightforward person. I don’t want any nonsense to grow around me, and I want the same to be true about you. When I say that every enlightened being disappears into the same universe – and there is no question of anybody being higher or lower – you have to learn it. It is the first time that anybody is telling his disciples to drop the ego which is hiding behind the idea that, “I have got the greatest master.”\nIt has nothing to do with the master, it has something to do with your own ego. Drop it. I am not the greatest master. In the world of masters there is no one who is great, and there is no one who is not great. All these categories are of the mind, they don’t apply when mind is no more.\nYou are simply an utter silence, a pure presence with no person there. It is the same experience, the same taste, the same sweetness, the same blissfulness, the same truth, the same consciousness, the same ecstasy.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\n“LIVING IN THE HERE AND NOW, ACTING SPONTANEOUSLY,” WILL I FIND THAT MY ACTIONS WILL STILL BE GUIDED BY EXPERIENCE AND RESPONSIBILITY?\nDhyan Prabuddha, I find it always difficult to answer questions which are only intellectual, which arise out of your fear, out of your reason, but not out of your experience, not out of your meditation. You are saying, “living in the here and now, acting spontaneously,” and the statement is within inverted commas. You must be quoting me, it is still not your experience. Just because I have been saying that, “living in the here and now, acting spontaneously” is all that can be said about meditation, and that if this is possible, everything else will settle down on its own accord, your mind starts spinning questions.\nYou are asking, “Will I find that my actions will still be guided by experience and responsibility?” You don’t know anything about spontaneity, you don’t know anything about living here and now. Not only that, you don’t know anything about responsibility and you don’t know anything about experience.\nYour whole question is absolutely rootless, but I will try to answer it because I don’t want to hurt you. You don’t yet deserve it. Once you start deserving, then I don’t hesitate. Then I hit you this way and that way and you rejoice in it. But when you are not ready, I try to be as polite as possible.\nNow, you are saying, ” ... guided by experience ...,” which means guided by the past. And if you are here and now, how can you ask this question? It is a contradiction in terms. Guided by experience? Experience is certainly of the past. In other words you are saying, “Being here and now, will I still be guided by the past?” Then you are not here and now. Then the past is more important than using the here and now to guide you.\nThen you are afraid: perhaps if you act spontaneously, you may lose responsibility. And you don’t understand even the meaning of the word responsibility. The society has been so cunning. It has destroyed our most beautiful words, given them distorted meanings. Ordinarily in your dictionaries ‘responsibility’ means duty, doing things the way you are expected to do them by your parents, by your teachers, by your priests, by your politicians, by somebody else.\nYour responsibility is to fulfill the demands made upon you by your elders and your society. If you act accordingly, you are a responsible person; if you act on your own – individually – then you are an irresponsible person. And your fear is: in acting spontaneously, here and now, there is a danger – you may start acting individually. What will happen to your responsibility?\nThe fact is that ‘responsibility’, the very word, has to be broken into two words. It means ‘response ability’. And response is possible only if you are spontaneous, here and now. Response means that your attention, your awareness, your consciousness, is totally here and now, in the present. So whatever happens, you respond with your whole being. It is not a question of being in tune with somebody else, some holy scripture, or some holy idiot. It simply means to be in tune with the present moment. This ability to respond is responsibility.\nBut without experience you will not be able to see the contradiction in your question. Yes, I say you will be able to act with absolute response-ability. But it will not be the responsibility that you have been taught and conditioned for. It will be a totally new phenomenon.\nIt will be just like a mirror. If you come in front of it, it responds, it reflects you. The moment you have gone out of its focus, it is again silent. It is not a photographic film that catches your reflection. It remains always clean and available. Whoever comes in front of it – it will respond with totality and reflect the reality. The consciousness which is in the present is just like a mirror.\nAny situation comes ... There are times when you are in the present in spite of yourself. For example, if walking on the path you suddenly come across a long snake, are you going to be guided by past experience? Are you going to be responsible? You will forget all that you have learned: all teachings, all scriptures, all teachers, parents. Suddenly you will find the here and now because this is not a time to think about what to do, what is right and what is wrong. You will simply jump out of the way. This will be responsibility, spontaneity.\nOr your house is on fire and you are taking a shower, naked. Are you going to dress before you get out of the house? Put your tie right? Polish your shoes? Have a look in the mirror? See whether all the buttons are in the right holes? No, there is no time. The house is on fire. You have to jump out\nof your bathroom window. And you will jump even without a towel around you. You will simply jump naked, just out of the shower through the window. This is spontaneous. It is not guided, because you have not been continuously experiencing your house catching fire. It has never happened before. So there is no past experience to guide you. And nobody, your father or your mother or your teacher has ever told you that if you are under the shower naked, and the house catches fire, at least put the towel around yourself before you jump out of the window. Nobody has taught you. There is no book. I have looked into all the books about etiquette, not a single book is giving any guidance. If you are waiting for guidance you will be stuck in the bathroom. You will search in your mind and you will not find any guidance at all.\nAnd if you think you cannot do anything without guidance, then you are finished. Then there is no more life for you, no more future. The window was open. You could have jumped. But it has to be a spontaneous action in the moment, here now. And I call it absolutely responsible, responsible to life, responsible to your own being. You are avoiding committing suicide.\nBut you have not lived a single moment here and now. And you have never acted spontaneously. Hence the fear is natural, that if you act spontaneously, what about the guidance that you have been given – do this, don’t do that? What about all those ten commandments? What about all the religious and moral teachings?\nWhen you are acting according to past experience and teachings and conditionings, you are not a real person. You are absolutely phony, because you are not looking at the real situation. You are searching for the right answer in the memory. And the memory has never come across such a situation.\nEvery situation is so new, that you cannot be guided by experience. If you are guided by experience, it is going to be wrong action and that is the whole misery of the world. Everybody is acting wrongly, trying to be right – this is the trouble – trying to be in tune with past experience. But this situation has never happened before. This is so new.\nI was driving from Jabalpur to Nagpur. And just outside a small village the car broke down. I was hoping to reach the nearest government rest house, because it was time for my afternoon sleep. So I took out a blanket and went under a tree, and the three persons who were with me simply watched what I was doing. And I went to sleep. They said, “This is strange. We are looking embarrassed and stupid, we are sitting here, and he has gone to sleep already. And he does not bother that the car is broken and something has to be done. And he was driving. And we don’t know how to drive, we don’t know what has gone wrong.” They all three came and shook me.\nI said, “Don’t disturb me. Wake me at two! Car or no car, but I have to have my sleep.” They said, “This is strange, where should we go now?”\nI said, “Go to hell, but don’t disturb me!”\nThey said, “This is strange, you were driving us.”\nI said, “Forget all about it. Now the car is not worth driving. Find some car. While I am asleep, do something!”\nAt two o’clock I woke up. All three were sitting by the side of the car, very sad-looking, hungry. I said, “What are you doing?”\nThey said, “What can we do? We are feeling very hungry and ...” I said, “At least, the village is near, you could have gone there.”\nThey said, “We could not leave the car, all our luggage and everything is in it.”\nI said, “Then at least one person could have gone, two could have remained here. Or two could have gone, one could have remained here.”\nThey said, “Nobody trusts anybody.”\nI said, “This is strange. I went to sleep, I trusted you all, though I knew perfectly well with a broken car, where could you go?”\nThen I stopped a car and I asked the man who was driving if he knew anything about cars to have a look at mine, because I have never looked under the hood. I have never ... That is the work of Avesh or Anandadas, but I have never opened the hood. I don’t know what is inside it. Whether a ghost runs it or an engine is there, I don’t know at all. I simply know how to drive. That too is illegal, because I cannot keep both things in mind. When I am driving, I am driving. And then as fast as the car can go, it goes. I cannot bother that the government thinks it should go fifty-five miles per hour.\nI think all these governments are a little unintelligent. If you don’t want a car to go beyond fifty-five, then why are cars allowed to be produced which can go one hundred and forty miles per hour? Strange! It is such an absurd situation. If you allow cars to be produced to go one hundred and forty miles per hour, you are giving me permission. And I trust that if the car says one hundred and forty, it will go a hundred and forty.\nSo I told the driver just to have a look. And there was nothing wrong, just something small and he fixed it within fifteen minutes.\nThose three people said, “This is strange. So many cars have passed, but the idea did not arise in our minds to stop a car and ask somebody to look at ours.”\nI said, “You must be waiting for experience to guide you.”\nTo me this was a new situation, my car had never broken down before. In fact I had never driven alone. Somebody was always driving ahead of me; sometimes two cars were driving, one behind me, one ahead of me, just to take care of my car. This was the first time that I had tried to go on my own.\nThose two cars prevent me from being illegal. If my front car does not move at more than forty miles per hour, how can I? So they keep me within the limit. I wanted to try the car at its full speed and that was the reason why it broke down, because although they say it should go a hundred and forty but nobody tries it. Nobody thinks that the roads are made for only fifty-five miles per hour. And in India, they are not even made for that much.\nAnd the traffic is so crazy – many, many centuries all going along in the traffic. A bullock cart, a camel, an elephant, you name it and you will find it in the traffic. And cows are resting in the middle of the road and because they are mother cows, you cannot disturb them. And father bulls ... they are standing in the middle of the road and, being a nonviolent country, you cannot do anything against them. You cannot take them to the court or ...\nLife brings every day new situations. And if you are waiting to be guided by past experience, you will miss the opportunity to act responsibly, to act spontaneously. To me the greatest morality is to act spontaneously. And you will always be right, because your full awareness will be involved. More than that you cannot do. More than that existence cannot demand from you. And if you are focused totally in the present, what more can you do? You are bringing your whole energy and consciousness to solve the question, to get out of the situation. More than that is not possible. So whatever happens is right.\nThis whole idea of responsibility and being guided by experience is told to you by people who don’t want you to be here and now. They go on giving you advice on how to act, what to do, but they don’t know that life does not go according to their guidelines. Their guidance becomes misguidance in any real moment.\nA rich old woman whose husband has just died decides to get married. But this time she wants to have some fun. So she advertises in the world press for a young, strong twenty-year-old virgin. She gets thousands of replies, all accompanied by a photograph, but she is particularly attracted to a huge, bronzed Australian from the outback.\nShe flies him to New York and they are married the next week.\nOn the wedding night, the old bride is fixing herself up in the bathroom when she hears strange noises coming from the bedroom. She opens the door to find the huge Australian moving all the furniture to the sides of the room.\n“What are you doing?” she cries.\n“Well,” replies the man, “if it is going to be anything like making love to a kangaroo, we are going to need all the space we can get!”\nThat man is guided by experience. He has known only how to love a kangaroo. If you bring a man from the outback of Australia, you are in for trouble. The poor fellow is simply guided by his past experience that the space seems to be too small. If it is going to be something like making love to a kangaroo, who is going to jump all over the place ...\nDon’t be bothered by the past. What is past is past. And you have to be in the present. And this is the only way to be response-able. This is the only way to be adequate to the situation you are facing. Otherwise you will find yourself always inadequate.\nA woman who loves rock and roll music goes to the local tattoo artist and says, “I want a tattoo of Elvis Presley on the inside of my thigh. Can you do it?”\n“Sure,” says the man.\nWhen he has finished, the girl looks down and says in disgust, “That does not look like Elvis. No way! I am not going to pay you for that.”\n“Okay,” says the artist, “let me try again on your other thigh.” When he has finished, the woman is furious. “That does not look like Elvis either,” she exclaims.\n“Wait a minute,” says the tattoo artist in desperation, “I will go out and bring in a guy off the street; if he can identify the tattoos, will you pay me?”\nThe girl agrees, so he rushes out and finds a drunk staggering along the road. He drags him into the studio, points at the girl’s spread thighs and says to the drunkard, “Can you recognize these two tattoos?”\nThe drunk says, “I don’t know about the guys on the thighs, but that guy in the middle is definitely Mick Jagger.”\nSo you have to respond to the reality.\nA wild, Irish wedding reception is brought to a premature end when Paddy grabs the microphone and announces, “The party is over. We have run out of booze, there is no food left, and somebody has fucked the bride.”\nAs everyone is heading towards the doors discussing what had happened, another announcement is made, “It is okay, folks, you can come back. We have found another case of Guinness, Maureen is making some sandwiches, and the guy who fucked the bride has apologized. So everything is okay, come back!”\nYou have to respond to every kind of situation in the world. Past guidance is not of much help. Every moment you will be coming across something new. The world is very inventive. That’s why all so- called religious people who are guided by the past look so sad. They are always missing the train. They go on looking for guidance, but this is not the situation for which the guidance was given. It may have been right in a certain moment, in a certain situation, but it is nothing that can be eternally true.\nOnly one thing is eternally true, and that is your consciousness. And if you can bring your consciousness to the present, you cannot go wrong. Whatever you do out of that consciousness is always going to be right, not according to any criterion, but just because it is coming out of a total awareness. Out of total awareness nobody has ever done anything wrong. According to me, right is what comes out of your spontaneity and out of your consciousness and out of your presence here and now.\nAnd what is not out of your spontaneity, consciousness and your being here and now is wrong. There is no other criterion than what I have just told you. All other criteria are dead. They may have been living at one time, but that time is past. Heraclitus is right, you cannot step in the same river twice. And he was stating something about life and existence.\nHence there cannot be any guidance. All guidance will create trouble for you. You have to be kept absolutely clean of all guidance, so that you can respond with total awareness to the present\nsituation without any hesitation, without any thinking. Just out of your silent awareness arises the response and it is the most beautiful, the most honest, most authentic answer that could have come to anybody.\nBecause humanity has been forced always to be guided by the past, there is so much misery. If what I am saying is listened to by humanity, there will be great joy all over the earth, immense laughter, immense rejoicing, no repentance, no guilt, no confessions.\nOkay, Maneesha? Yes, Osho.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"6016","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/sat_chit_anand/part20/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/sat_chit_anand/>Sat Chit Anand</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">20 Response ability</h1><div class=post-meta>29 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;6016 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Sat_Chit_Anand/part20.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part19>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

BOTH
KRISHNAMURTI AND GURDJIEFF WERE TALKING ABOUT THEIR WAVES OF
CONSCIOUSNESS.</p><p><br></p><p>BELOVED MASTER, ARE THEY THE WAVES OF YOUR OCEAN?</p><p><br></p><p>Shridhar, J. Krishnamurti and George Gurdjieff are not just two waves
in the ocean of consciousness. They are the very ocean of consciousness
itself. The moment you become enlightened you are no longer an
individual. You lose your ego, and with the ego you lose all your
limits, all your boundaries. They are not waves of my ocean; the ocean
belongs to no one. I am the same ocean as they are.</p><p><br></p><p>You are also the same ocean as I am. You just have to wake up and
realize the fact that your imprisonment is your imagination, that your
fetters are nothing but your thoughts, that your bondage is nothing but
your own unconscious way of living. Otherwise you are as oceanic as any
Gautam Buddha, as any Lao Tzu, as any Kabir, as anyone who has ever
realized his ultimate, his sachchidanand.</p><p><br></p><p>We are not separate. We belong to one existence without any
demarcation lines. All limitations are mind projections. The moment you
are beyond mind and you can see without the mind directly, you will be
surprised that the trees and the stars and the oceans ... There is
nowhere any demarcation.</p><p>The flowers of the trees are your flowers, the greatness of the stars
is your greatness, and the smallness of the grass leaves is your
smallness. The moment you start feeling this universalness, you have
come home.</p><p><br></p><p>But remember always not to put me above anybody else, just because I
am your master. So don’t say that I am the ocean and J. Krishnamurti and
Gurdjieff are just waves. That is ugly.</p><p><br></p><p>You may not be aware from where these kinds of ideas continuously
come. And this is not only the case with you ...</p><p><br></p><p>Just today, Hasya was telling me about some Korean master, Su. He is
going to come soon. He has disciples. Lani has just come from Korea. In
the Korean language they have published more than thirty-five books of
mine. Hundreds of people are interested in coming. They were not even
aware where I am, and whether I am still alive or some past master.</p><p><br></p><p>Not only the so-called disciples go on praising their master as the
highest. Even the so-called masters ... certainly they are not masters,
just so-called. When master Su’s disciples asked him, “What are the
categories between you and Bhagwan?” he said he belongs to the first
category of enlightened people and Bhagwan belongs to the third category
of enlightened people.</p><p><br></p><p>Now such a man cannot be enlightened, to say nothing of first, second
and third category, because there are no categories in enlightenment.
How can you be enlightened and still belong to a certain category? The
category is a limitation.</p><p><br></p><p>But the so-called masters will always put themselves higher than
anybody else. The ego lingers on, whether you are in the world of
matter, money, power, prestige or whether you are pretending to be a
seeker, a searcher, a spiritual being. Even when you start declaring
yourself as enlightened you are playing the same old game with new
names. There is no difference at all.</p><p><br></p><p>I am waiting for master Su to come. He is going to be in trouble! He
does not know me. In the first class enlightened category ... Why should
a master who belongs to the first class come to a third class
enlightened man in the first place? This is strange! So let him come. He
will have to stand in line for the first time in his life.</p><p><br></p><p>Once you are enlightened there are no categories. Enlightenment
simply means going beyond all categories, all mind trips, all ego trips.
It is simply becoming one with the universe.</p><p><br></p><p>The reason for people like master Su is the simple pious ego, now
acting in the name of spirituality. The game is old: one has to be on
the top. But why do the disciples do this? The reason is the same. If I
am the greatest master, then naturally – you are my disciple – you are
the disciple of the greatest master. You are no ordinary disciple, you
are not a disciple of a third class enlightened man!</p><p><br></p><p>I have told you about one religious cult that exists only around the
area of the Taj Mahal. They are called Radhaswamis. They were very much
disturbed by the presence of the Taj Mahal. Now the Taj Mahal has
nothing to do with their spirituality. But the disturbance began when
their master died – they determined to make his memorial better than the
Taj Mahal.</p><p>The Taj Mahal is unique in the whole world, there is no other
building that can be compared to it. And it was made by a great emperor.
It took thirty years in building, and almost ten thousand stonecutters,
sculptors ... Master builders were gathered from faraway countries, the
best from Iran, from Turkey, from Egypt, from Arabia. And the emperor
who was making it had the whole empire of India and all the money was
pouring into it.</p><p><br></p><p>These ten thousand people worked almost ... When they had come they
were young; by the time the Taj Mahal was completed, either they were
old or dead. The second generation was working. Sometimes they had come
old – they were famous so they were brought – so the third generation
was working.</p><p><br></p><p>And the emperor who was making it as a memorial to his wife, Mumtaj,
was also making on the other side of the river Jamuna his own memorial.
When he died he would be buried there. Emperors took care while they
were alive to make their memorial too, because after they were dead
nobody was going to bother to put so much money and effort into it.</p><p><br></p><p>But his whole treasure was finished with the wife’s memorial. His own
memorial has only the foundation stones. He could not complete it
because he was dethroned by his own son and kept in jail. And the son
immediately dropped the plan of the second memorial.</p><p><br></p><p>The Taj Mahal is made of white marble, all Italian marble. And the
other memorial, just on the other side of the river – at the end he was
going to make a bridge – was going to be exactly the same as the Taj
Mahal, but in black marble. He was creating a beautiful symmetry. The
architect was going to be exactly the same, the building exactly the
same, just the marble was going to be white on the wife’s memorial and
black on his own memorial.</p><p><br></p><p>Now these followers wanted to try to make something better than the
Taj Mahal, because thousands of tourists were coming every day to see
the Taj Mahal. Naturally they thought it was not only a question of
prestige, it was also a question of business. It had been going on for
almost one hundred years.</p><p><br></p><p>They had been able to make only the ground floor. Certainly they have
made it far better than the Taj Mahal, but there seems to be no
possibility that they will be able to complete it. They wanted to make
it a three-story building, so it goes higher than the Taj Mahal, but all
the money that they could collect from their followers from all over
India is finished. For one hundred years continuously thousands of
workers have been involved in making it.</p><p><br></p><p>I have seen ... Their pillars are so beautiful, so creative: on the
pillars they have made creepers in marble. And the creepers have green
flowers of green marble and roses on top of the creepers made in rubies,
emeralds, diamonds. They have certainly made it clear that if they
complete it – even incomplete – it has gone beyond the Taj Mahal. They
are immensely happy. They invited me when I was speaking at Agra
University ... They invited me to show me their incomplete memorial.
They have done a tremendously great job.</p><p><br></p><p>They took me inside. Inside they have a map drawn on the marble and
on the map there are fourteen divisions. And they have put all the
enlightened people that they could think of in the division to which he
belongs. There are not only three categories ... According to them there
are fourteen.</p><p>Mohammed is in the third division, Jesus is in the fifth – so is
Moses. In the sixth is Mahavira and Buddha. In the seventh, Kabir,
Nanak, and in that way they went on. Names are engraved in marble.</p><p><br></p><p>And in the fourteenth there is only one man, their own master, who
was not known outside Agra. All his following is centered in Agra. A few
people have moved to different places, but basically, it is a
one-city-oriented religion. They asked me what was my opinion about this
map.</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Who has made this map?”</p><p><br></p><p>They said, “It is in our holy scripture. Our master himself has made
this.” I said, “Your master is right. He is in the fourteenth.”</p><p>They looked at me, because before me they had shown that map to many
people. Everybody disagreed because their masters were put in the fifth
degree, somebody’s master in the third degree, somebody’s master at the
most in the seventh. After the seventh, the other six planes are empty.
The fourteenth, the highest reach of consciousness, has been achieved by
their master. Naturally no Hindu will agree, no Mohammedan will agree,
no Jaina will agree, no Jew, no Christian, no Buddhist. Nobody is going
to agree. I was the first man to agree with what they said.</p><p><br></p><p>They said, “You are the only man who understands.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Certainly, because I am on the fifteenth and I know your
master is trying, making every effort, to enter into the fifteenth. I
don’t allow him! He tries hard, but I don’t open the door. And as long
as I am there on the fifteenth – and there is no sixteenth, so I cannot
go anywhere else – your master has no chance.”</p><p><br></p><p>They said, “Fifteenth? But in our scripture there are only
fourteen.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I think that’s natural. Your master knows about only fourteen
because he has never entered the fifteenth.”</p><p><br></p><p>They were very much shocked and angry. Their whole desire is that
their master is accepted as the highest, then they are certainly the
most significant people on the earth, following the greatest master. And
the master was also on the same trip because in his own writing, which
nobody reads except his own disciples – and they are not many, but they
are very rich people ...</p><p><br></p><p>They showed me their scripture. He has written with his own hand the
names of Gautam Buddha and Jesus and Kabir on lower steps, and his own
name he has written on the highest. That very stupidity shows that he is
not even on the lowest, the first floor. He does not know anything about
enlightenment.</p><p><br></p><p>He may have been a learned scholar. That seems to be a possibility,
because he writes well. But he is writing everything as a parrot,
repeating from old Indian scriptures. There is not a single statement
which is original.</p><p><br></p><p>I asked them, “Show me something that is original. A man who has
reached to the highest plane of consciousness must say something which
nobody has said, because nobody has reached to that</p><p>plane. Show me something. Because all that is written in it has been
said by people who are just on the third, fourth, fifth ... What is your
master’s own statement? What is his testimony?”</p><p><br></p><p>They could not find a single statement in their whole book which was
not stolen. But this thing goes on and on.</p><p><br></p><p>The man who brought me to Poona for the first time, nearabout thirty
years ago, was a follower of Mahavira and he was also a follower of
Mahatma Gandhi. He lived with Mahatma Gandhi in his ashram for years.
His name was Rishabhdas Ranka. Many people of Poona must know him.
Because Mahatma Gandhi was teaching continuously that all religions are
the same, essentially the same – no religion is higher than the other,
they are all equal – he also learned, like a parrot, to repeat it.</p><p><br></p><p>And then he wrote a book on Mahavira and Gautam Buddha, and he showed
me the manuscript. I simply saw the title and I said to him, “Just look
at your title. I don’t have to read your book – your title says
everything.” In his title he writes, ‘Bhagwan Mahavir’ and ‘Mahatma
Gautam Buddha’. ‘Bhagwan’ is used for Mahavir, and for Gautam Buddha,
just ‘Mahatma’. There are so many mahatmas; ‘Mahatma’ is not something
very special or unique.</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “You are writing this book to show that Jainism and Buddhism
are equal, and their message essentially is the same. And Gautam Buddha
and Mahavira are equally enlightened.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Then why this difference? Either put ‘Mahatma’ in front of
both the persons or put ‘Bhagwan’.”</p><p><br></p><p>Now he was in a great dilemma. He could not write ‘Mahatma Mahavir’.
The Jainas would kill him, they would expel him. He was a Jaina ...
Nobody, not a single Jaina in twenty-five centuries, has made such an
insult – writing about Mahavira as just a mahatma. Mahatmas are
available in this country for one rupee a dozen. They are so cheap,
every village has its own mahatma.</p><p><br></p><p>And he was not willing to write ‘Bhagwan’ before Gautam Buddha
because no Jaina accepts Gautam Buddha as equal to Mahavira. He is
enlightened, but not of the same height. Mahavira’s enlightenment is
complete; Buddha’s enlightenment is incomplete – partial enlightenment,
not total.</p><p><br></p><p>And the same is the situation of the Buddhists. They will not be
ready to call ... I have asked Buddhist monks. One Buddhist monk was
born an Englishman, but got converted when he was young and became a
Buddhist monk. I don’t know whether he is still alive or not, but he was
a world famous man, Sanghrakshita. He lives in the Himalayas, in
Kalimpong.</p><p><br></p><p>He used to come to the university where I was teaching and he became
interested in me, because he was always invited to the Philosophy
Department. I used to raise questions and he was in difficulty trying to
answer them. But he was a very nice person, he never became angry. On
the contrary, if he could not answer me he used to ask if I had some
idea of what the answer could be. I said, “I never ask anything unless I
know the answer.”</p><p><br></p><p>We became friends. He even started staying with me while he was in
the city. I asked him, “What do you think about Mahavira?” Mahavira and
Buddha were contemporaries.</p><p>He said, “About Mahavira? He was enlightened, but not so completely
as Gautam Buddha.”</p><p><br></p><p>The same nonsense goes on around the world. But the reason the
disciples are concerned or the so-called masters are concerned is the
same. It is the ego that needs a certain kind of gratification.</p><p><br></p><p>Shridhar, as far as J. Krishnamurti and George Gurdjieff are
concerned, they are both enlightened. Both have disappeared in the same
ocean in which all enlightened people have always disappeared. And
beyond enlightenment there is no distinction. There is no question,
because the person is no more.</p><p><br></p><p>When the dewdrop falls into the ocean, do you think there will be
differences, that when another dewdrop falls into the ocean, it will
only partially fall into the ocean? Can a dewdrop fall partially into
the ocean? Is it possible for any dewdrop to be different from any other
dewdrop? They will all become the ocean.</p><p><br></p><p>I am a clear-cut, straightforward person. I don’t want any nonsense
to grow around me, and I want the same to be true about you. When I say
that every enlightened being disappears into the same universe – and
there is no question of anybody being higher or lower – you have to
learn it. It is the first time that anybody is telling his disciples to
drop the ego which is hiding behind the idea that, “I have got the
greatest master.”</p><p><br></p><p>It has nothing to do with the master, it has something to do with
your own ego. Drop it. I am not the greatest master. In the world of
masters there is no one who is great, and there is no one who is not
great. All these categories are of the mind, they don’t apply when mind
is no more.</p><p><br></p><p>You are simply an utter silence, a pure presence with no person
there. It is the same experience, the same taste, the same sweetness,
the same blissfulness, the same truth, the same consciousness, the same
ecstasy.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>“LIVING IN THE HERE AND NOW, ACTING SPONTANEOUSLY,” WILL I FIND THAT
MY ACTIONS WILL STILL BE GUIDED BY EXPERIENCE AND RESPONSIBILITY?</p><p><br></p><p>Dhyan Prabuddha, I find it always difficult to answer questions which
are only intellectual, which arise out of your fear, out of your reason,
but not out of your experience, not out of your meditation. You are
saying, “living in the here and now, acting spontaneously,” and the
statement is within inverted commas. You must be quoting me, it is still
not your experience. Just because I have been saying that, “living in
the here and now, acting spontaneously” is all that can be said about
meditation, and that if this is possible, everything else will settle
down on its own accord, your mind starts spinning questions.</p><p><br></p><p>You are asking, “Will I find that my actions will still be guided by
experience and responsibility?” You don’t know anything about
spontaneity, you don’t know anything about living here and now. Not only
that, you don’t know anything about responsibility and you don’t know
anything about experience.</p><p>Your whole question is absolutely rootless, but I will try to answer
it because I don’t want to hurt you. You don’t yet deserve it. Once you
start deserving, then I don’t hesitate. Then I hit you this way and that
way and you rejoice in it. But when you are not ready, I try to be as
polite as possible.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, you are saying, ” ... guided by experience ...,” which means
guided by the past. And if you are here and now, how can you ask this
question? It is a contradiction in terms. Guided by experience?
Experience is certainly of the past. In other words you are saying,
“Being here and now, will I still be guided by the past?” Then you are
not here and now. Then the past is more important than using the here
and now to guide you.</p><p><br></p><p>Then you are afraid: perhaps if you act spontaneously, you may lose
responsibility. And you don’t understand even the meaning of the word
responsibility. The society has been so cunning. It has destroyed our
most beautiful words, given them distorted meanings. Ordinarily in your
dictionaries ‘responsibility’ means duty, doing things the way you are
expected to do them by your parents, by your teachers, by your priests,
by your politicians, by somebody else.</p><p><br></p><p>Your responsibility is to fulfill the demands made upon you by your
elders and your society. If you act accordingly, you are a responsible
person; if you act on your own – individually – then you are an
irresponsible person. And your fear is: in acting spontaneously, here
and now, there is a danger – you may start acting individually. What
will happen to your responsibility?</p><p><br></p><p>The fact is that ‘responsibility’, the very word, has to be broken
into two words. It means ‘response ability’. And response is possible
only if you are spontaneous, here and now. Response means that your
attention, your awareness, your consciousness, is totally here and now,
in the present. So whatever happens, you respond with your whole being.
It is not a question of being in tune with somebody else, some holy
scripture, or some holy idiot. It simply means to be in tune with the
present moment. This ability to respond is responsibility.</p><p><br></p><p>But without experience you will not be able to see the contradiction
in your question. Yes, I say you will be able to act with absolute
response-ability. But it will not be the responsibility that you have
been taught and conditioned for. It will be a totally new
phenomenon.</p><p><br></p><p>It will be just like a mirror. If you come in front of it, it
responds, it reflects you. The moment you have gone out of its focus, it
is again silent. It is not a photographic film that catches your
reflection. It remains always clean and available. Whoever comes in
front of it – it will respond with totality and reflect the reality. The
consciousness which is in the present is just like a mirror.</p><p><br></p><p>Any situation comes ... There are times when you are in the present
in spite of yourself. For example, if walking on the path you suddenly
come across a long snake, are you going to be guided by past experience?
Are you going to be responsible? You will forget all that you have
learned: all teachings, all scriptures, all teachers, parents. Suddenly
you will find the here and now because this is not a time to think about
what to do, what is right and what is wrong. You will simply jump out of
the way. This will be responsibility, spontaneity.</p><p><br></p><p>Or your house is on fire and you are taking a shower, naked. Are you
going to dress before you get out of the house? Put your tie right?
Polish your shoes? Have a look in the mirror? See whether all the
buttons are in the right holes? No, there is no time. The house is on
fire. You have to jump out</p><p>of your bathroom window. And you will jump even without a towel
around you. You will simply jump naked, just out of the shower through
the window. This is spontaneous. It is not guided, because you have not
been continuously experiencing your house catching fire. It has never
happened before. So there is no past experience to guide you. And
nobody, your father or your mother or your teacher has ever told you
that if you are under the shower naked, and the house catches fire, at
least put the towel around yourself before you jump out of the window.
Nobody has taught you. There is no book. I have looked into all the
books about etiquette, not a single book is giving any guidance. If you
are waiting for guidance you will be stuck in the bathroom. You will
search in your mind and you will not find any guidance at all.</p><p><br></p><p>And if you think you cannot do anything without guidance, then you
are finished. Then there is no more life for you, no more future. The
window was open. You could have jumped. But it has to be a spontaneous
action in the moment, here now. And I call it absolutely responsible,
responsible to life, responsible to your own being. You are avoiding
committing suicide.</p><p><br></p><p>But you have not lived a single moment here and now. And you have
never acted spontaneously. Hence the fear is natural, that if you act
spontaneously, what about the guidance that you have been given – do
this, don’t do that? What about all those ten commandments? What about
all the religious and moral teachings?</p><p><br></p><p>When you are acting according to past experience and teachings and
conditionings, you are not a real person. You are absolutely phony,
because you are not looking at the real situation. You are searching for
the right answer in the memory. And the memory has never come across
such a situation.</p><p><br></p><p>Every situation is so new, that you cannot be guided by experience.
If you are guided by experience, it is going to be wrong action and that
is the whole misery of the world. Everybody is acting wrongly, trying to
be right – this is the trouble – trying to be in tune with past
experience. But this situation has never happened before. This is so
new.</p><p><br></p><p>I was driving from Jabalpur to Nagpur. And just outside a small
village the car broke down. I was hoping to reach the nearest government
rest house, because it was time for my afternoon sleep. So I took out a
blanket and went under a tree, and the three persons who were with me
simply watched what I was doing. And I went to sleep. They said, “This
is strange. We are looking embarrassed and stupid, we are sitting here,
and he has gone to sleep already. And he does not bother that the car is
broken and something has to be done. And he was driving. And we don’t
know how to drive, we don’t know what has gone wrong.” They all three
came and shook me.</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Don’t disturb me. Wake me at two! Car or no car, but I have
to have my sleep.” They said, “This is strange, where should we go
now?”</p><p>I said, “Go to hell, but don’t disturb me!”</p><p><br></p><p>They said, “This is strange, you were driving us.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Forget all about it. Now the car is not worth driving. Find
some car. While I am asleep, do something!”</p><p>At two o’clock I woke up. All three were sitting by the side of the
car, very sad-looking, hungry. I said, “What are you doing?”</p><p><br></p><p>They said, “What can we do? We are feeling very hungry and ...” I
said, “At least, the village is near, you could have gone there.”</p><p>They said, “We could not leave the car, all our luggage and
everything is in it.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Then at least one person could have gone, two could have
remained here. Or two could have gone, one could have remained
here.”</p><p><br></p><p>They said, “Nobody trusts anybody.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “This is strange. I went to sleep, I trusted you all, though
I knew perfectly well with a broken car, where could you go?”</p><p><br></p><p>Then I stopped a car and I asked the man who was driving if he knew
anything about cars to have a look at mine, because I have never looked
under the hood. I have never ... That is the work of Avesh or Anandadas,
but I have never opened the hood. I don’t know what is inside it.
Whether a ghost runs it or an engine is there, I don’t know at all. I
simply know how to drive. That too is illegal, because I cannot keep
both things in mind. When I am driving, I am driving. And then as fast
as the car can go, it goes. I cannot bother that the government thinks
it should go fifty-five miles per hour.</p><p><br></p><p>I think all these governments are a little unintelligent. If you
don’t want a car to go beyond fifty-five, then why are cars allowed to
be produced which can go one hundred and forty miles per hour? Strange!
It is such an absurd situation. If you allow cars to be produced to go
one hundred and forty miles per hour, you are giving me permission. And
I trust that if the car says one hundred and forty, it will go a hundred
and forty.</p><p><br></p><p>So I told the driver just to have a look. And there was nothing
wrong, just something small and he fixed it within fifteen minutes.</p><p><br></p><p>Those three people said, “This is strange. So many cars have passed,
but the idea did not arise in our minds to stop a car and ask somebody
to look at ours.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “You must be waiting for experience to guide you.”</p><p><br></p><p>To me this was a new situation, my car had never broken down before.
In fact I had never driven alone. Somebody was always driving ahead of
me; sometimes two cars were driving, one behind me, one ahead of me,
just to take care of my car. This was the first time that I had tried to
go on my own.</p><p><br></p><p>Those two cars prevent me from being illegal. If my front car does
not move at more than forty miles per hour, how can I? So they keep me
within the limit. I wanted to try the car at its full speed and that was
the reason why it broke down, because although they say it should go a
hundred and forty but nobody tries it. Nobody thinks that the roads are
made for only fifty-five miles per hour. And in India, they are not even
made for that much.</p><p>And the traffic is so crazy – many, many centuries all going along in
the traffic. A bullock cart, a camel, an elephant, you name it and you
will find it in the traffic. And cows are resting in the middle of the
road and because they are mother cows, you cannot disturb them. And
father bulls ... they are standing in the middle of the road and, being
a nonviolent country, you cannot do anything against them. You cannot
take them to the court or ...</p><p><br></p><p>Life brings every day new situations. And if you are waiting to be
guided by past experience, you will miss the opportunity to act
responsibly, to act spontaneously. To me the greatest morality is to act
spontaneously. And you will always be right, because your full awareness
will be involved. More than that you cannot do. More than that existence
cannot demand from you. And if you are focused totally in the present,
what more can you do? You are bringing your whole energy and
consciousness to solve the question, to get out of the situation. More
than that is not possible. So whatever happens is right.</p><p><br></p><p>This whole idea of responsibility and being guided by experience is
told to you by people who don’t want you to be here and now. They go on
giving you advice on how to act, what to do, but they don’t know that
life does not go according to their guidelines. Their guidance becomes
misguidance in any real moment.</p><p><br></p><p>A rich old woman whose husband has just died decides to get married.
But this time she wants to have some fun. So she advertises in the world
press for a young, strong twenty-year-old virgin. She gets thousands of
replies, all accompanied by a photograph, but she is particularly
attracted to a huge, bronzed Australian from the outback.</p><p><br></p><p>She flies him to New York and they are married the next week.</p><p><br></p><p>On the wedding night, the old bride is fixing herself up in the
bathroom when she hears strange noises coming from the bedroom. She
opens the door to find the huge Australian moving all the furniture to
the sides of the room.</p><p><br></p><p>“What are you doing?” she cries.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well,” replies the man, “if it is going to be anything like making
love to a kangaroo, we are going to need all the space we can get!”</p><p><br></p><p>That man is guided by experience. He has known only how to love a
kangaroo. If you bring a man from the outback of Australia, you are in
for trouble. The poor fellow is simply guided by his past experience
that the space seems to be too small. If it is going to be something
like making love to a kangaroo, who is going to jump all over the place
...</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t be bothered by the past. What is past is past. And you have to
be in the present. And this is the only way to be response-able. This is
the only way to be adequate to the situation you are facing. Otherwise
you will find yourself always inadequate.</p><p><br></p><p>A woman who loves rock and roll music goes to the local tattoo artist
and says, “I want a tattoo of Elvis Presley on the inside of my thigh.
Can you do it?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sure,” says the man.</p><p>When he has finished, the girl looks down and says in disgust, “That
does not look like Elvis. No way! I am not going to pay you for
that.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay,” says the artist, “let me try again on your other thigh.” When
he has finished, the woman is furious. “That does not look like Elvis
either,” she exclaims.</p><p><br></p><p>“Wait a minute,” says the tattoo artist in desperation, “I will go
out and bring in a guy off the street; if he can identify the tattoos,
will you pay me?”</p><p><br></p><p>The girl agrees, so he rushes out and finds a drunk staggering along
the road. He drags him into the studio, points at the girl’s spread
thighs and says to the drunkard, “Can you recognize these two
tattoos?”</p><p><br></p><p>The drunk says, “I don’t know about the guys on the thighs, but that
guy in the middle is definitely Mick Jagger.”</p><p><br></p><p>So you have to respond to the reality.</p><p><br></p><p>A wild, Irish wedding reception is brought to a premature end when
Paddy grabs the microphone and announces, “The party is over. We have
run out of booze, there is no food left, and somebody has fucked the
bride.”</p><p><br></p><p>As everyone is heading towards the doors discussing what had
happened, another announcement is made, “It is okay, folks, you can come
back. We have found another case of Guinness, Maureen is making some
sandwiches, and the guy who fucked the bride has apologized. So
everything is okay, come back!”</p><p><br></p><p>You have to respond to every kind of situation in the world. Past
guidance is not of much help. Every moment you will be coming across
something new. The world is very inventive. That’s why all so- called
religious people who are guided by the past look so sad. They are always
missing the train. They go on looking for guidance, but this is not the
situation for which the guidance was given. It may have been right in a
certain moment, in a certain situation, but it is nothing that can be
eternally true.</p><p><br></p><p>Only one thing is eternally true, and that is your consciousness. And
if you can bring your consciousness to the present, you cannot go wrong.
Whatever you do out of that consciousness is always going to be right,
not according to any criterion, but just because it is coming out of a
total awareness. Out of total awareness nobody has ever done anything
wrong. According to me, right is what comes out of your spontaneity and
out of your consciousness and out of your presence here and now.</p><p><br></p><p>And what is not out of your spontaneity, consciousness and your being
here and now is wrong. There is no other criterion than what I have just
told you. All other criteria are dead. They may have been living at one
time, but that time is past. Heraclitus is right, you cannot step in the
same river twice. And he was stating something about life and
existence.</p><p><br></p><p>Hence there cannot be any guidance. All guidance will create trouble
for you. You have to be kept absolutely clean of all guidance, so that
you can respond with total awareness to the present</p><p>situation without any hesitation, without any thinking. Just out of
your silent awareness arises the response and it is the most beautiful,
the most honest, most authentic answer that could have come to
anybody.</p><p><br></p><p>Because humanity has been forced always to be guided by the past,
there is so much misery. If what I am saying is listened to by humanity,
there will be great joy all over the earth, immense laughter, immense
rejoicing, no repentance, no guilt, no confessions.</p><p><br></p><p>Okay, Maneesha? Yes, Osho.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part19>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

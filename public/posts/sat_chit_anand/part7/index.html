MEANING OR NO MEANING, JUST THE SOUND OF IT TOUCHES MY HEART DEEPLY.\nVimal, sat-chit-anand is included in those few words of all the languages of the world which have descended from the highest peak of consciousness. They are pure music, they are absolute poetry, they are no ordinary words. And if they touch your heart without even knowing the exact meaning, the reason is that they are re-echoing the soundless sound of those who have entered into that space.\nSanskrit can be proud that it has never been a living language used in the marketplace. Sanskrit lovers try to prove just the contrary. They try to prove that once it was a living language in which people talked, just like any other ordinary dialect. But I insist on my difference.\nI want to know why their insistence is for Sanskrit to be a living language used by ordinary people. They think if a language is not used by ordinary people then it loses something of importance, it is a dead language. Certainly it has never been used by the people, but it is not a dead language.\nIt is a language of the mystics. It is the language of those who know. It is not worldly, that’s true. It is something otherworldly, and this is not a criticism. In fact, this is the extraordinariness of the language, that it was only used by a very few people of tremendous understanding. Their each\nword has immense significance, because it is coming out of a deep experience of reality of their own being.\nThe so-called living languages are mundane. They are for the marketplace, for day-to-day use: naturally, they cannot contain something of the beyond. Perhaps Sanskrit is the only language ... and it is also the mother language of all the civilized languages of the world.\nIt is rare in the sense that the people who formulated it were not thinking of the material side of existence, but were more concerned that the words used would reflect something of consciousness, heights of consciousness, of love, of compassion, of ecstasy. Their words are mantras, sacred. They are coming from the very source of our life. It is possible.\nVimal, you say, “sat-chit-anand ... Meaning or no meaning, just the sound of it touches my heart deeply.” It is a soundless sound; or, in other words, the sound of silence, the sound of ultimate experience, the sound when you are no more – only the universe remains. Certainly you can avoid meaning. You can say “meaning or no meaning,” because meaning is of the mind.\nBut Sat-Chit-Anand has a significance which goes far higher than meaning. It is just a fragrance which has left the flower. The flower is visible – part of this world, part of matter – but the fragrance, you cannot catch hold of it. You can feel it, it can touch you deeply. It can reach to your innermost core, but still you cannot figure out the meaning of it. You cannot figure it out, what it is in reality.\nThe meaning is irrelevant here; significance becomes the relevance. Not that it has no meaning, but basically it has only significance. And the significance is that the very sound, Sat-Chit-Anand penetrates into the heart, breaking all the barriers and all the bars and all the defense measures. It resounds within your being, creating a subtle harmony, a deep peace, a strange feeling of fulfillment, of being at ease with the world, with the universe, with existence itself – at ease not only with existence, but with yourself too.\nIt is a pure silence, as if water can be condensed into ice, and the ice can be again melted into water. That is the reality of such beautiful sounds. They can be condensed into meaning, but their basic reality is to melt within you and to reach to each fiber of your being, to each cell, to give it a dance.\nThese are the mystic sounds. They are very few. I have talked to you about satyam-shivam- sundram, sat-chit-anand, hari om tat sat, om mani padme hum, om-shantih-shantih-shantih. These five I have chosen as the most significant, as the most deep-going. I will try to give you the meaning also, because that meaning will help the significance to become deeper. That meaning will not only touch your heart, it will also touch your intelligence. And you have to be touched in your totality to be transformed.\nI will begin with the last one. That is the sound every Eastern scripture ends with ... om-shantih- shantih-shantih. It means “The soundless sound, or the sound of silence: peace ... peace ... peace\n...” Just giving you the sense of the whole scripture in these few telegraphic words. Every scripture in the East ends with the same. It may be Hindu, it may be Buddhist, it may be Jaina – it doesn’t matter.\nThey are all different in their philosophies. They are all different in their theologies. They are different religions continuously in controversy for at least ten thousand years. But strangely, they all end their scriptures with the sound of silence: peace ... peace ... peace ... It seems they are all different roots of this experience.\nThey may differ about their roots, about the description of their roots. They may quarrel, they may contradict each other, but as far as the end is concerned, when they reach to the highest peak of consciousness, all that is found is the sound of silence and utter peace, so deep that they have to repeat it three times: peace ... peace ... peace ...\nThe fourth is used by the Tibetans, although it takes almost all the words from Sanskrit: om mani padme hum. It is a very mystic statement. It says, “The diamond in the lotus ... the sound of silence.” You cannot conceive a more beautiful thing than a beautiful diamond in the most beautiful flower on the earth, the lotus. They are trying to convey to you the beyond in some way comprehensible to the mind: the sound of silence – om – the diamond in the lotus. I have loved it from my very childhood. Just the words, “the diamond in the lotus ...” They have managed in the most beautiful way to express the beyond.\nAnd the third is hari om tat sat: “the sound of silence ... this is the only truth.” And the second is, sat-chit-anand: “truth, consciousness, bliss.”\nAnd the first is, satyam-shivam-sundram: “truth, godliness, beauty.”\nThese five I can say to you belong to the universal religious consciousness, not to any organized religion, because they have come from individual mystics. They have poured their heart, they have poured their enlightenment, they have poured their awakening into these five mantras.\nThere is no word in English to translate mantra. It means a sacred word, not of any use in the day-to-day life experiences, but only significant when you go beyond this visible world and enter into the invisible consciousness. A mantra is a secret key. It opens the door to the ultimate.\nBut the meaning, Vimal, is also significant, because you are in the mind. The sound may have gone deeper into your heart, thrilled you, but still it is good not to leave the mind completely out of your experience; because it can become a disturbance, it can become very vengeful.\nDon’t antagonize your mind. It can disturb everything. Have you watched how it disturbs your body? When you are in anger your whole body is disturbed: your stomach is disturbed, your blood pressure goes high, you start suddenly perspiring – even in an air-conditioned place. There have been many cases of heart attack in intense anger. The heart suddenly stops. The mind can disturb the body on one hand: it can disturb the heart on another hand. Very few people know its disturbances in the heart because that is not a common experience.\nBut if you don’t know the meaning, if the mind is not satisfied, soon it will start creating suspicion, doubt, skepticism. Soon it will start saying to you that you are being irrational, and you will be affected. And the impact of Sat-Chit-Anand on your heart will start disappearing if the mind is not in cooperation.\nMy whole effort is to transform your total being, not leaving anything outside, because nature does not intend it so. And when the mind can be persuaded to go along with you, there is no need to create an opposition. I am against creating any kind of unnecessary conflict and split in your being. It is better to create a bridge between mind, body and being.\nAnd the meaning is also tremendously beautiful. Sat means truth. And the longest search of man has been for that, because without knowing the truth, we know nothing. Truth is the very meaning of our existence. Without knowing truth we are just accidental, we don’t have any meaning.\nPerhaps something has gone wrong in nature and we are the product of it – freaks. Unless you know the meaning of yourself, you cannot have a deep relationship with the cosmos. The meaning is going to become a bridge with the cosmos. And unless you feel some meaning, some truth in your being, you are not yet aware of a deep communion with the whole.\nTruth is the experience of being in deep communion with the eternity of existence, and with the wholeness and the perfection and the grandeur and the magnificence of that which is.\nTruth simply means that which is. It is pure isness.\nAnd the revelation of this truth to you is only possible if your chit, your consciousness, rises to its ultimate flowering.\nIt is consciousness that is going to discover the truth. Hence, meditation is emphasized. Meditation will not give you the truth, it will give you more and more consciousness, and finally, consciousness gives you two things: on one hand, truth, and on the other hand, a tremendous bliss. You become almost like a bird with two wings. Truth is your one wing, bliss is your other wing. And you are pure consciousness.\nIn this experience you can fly like an eagle across the sun into the unknown. Then this whole universe belongs to you. Then wherever you are, you are at home. Then whatever you are, you are in utter peace. Then whatever happens is beautiful and brings tremendous gratitude to you.\nPrayer becomes your very heartbeat. You don’t pray in synagogues and in churches and in temples and mosques. Those are for the irreligious. Those are for the hypocrites. Those are for the pretenders. The authentic religious man has prayer in his heartbeats. He is continuously feeling a tremendous gratitude to all that existence has made available to us – life ... love ... laughter ...\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nIS MAN REALLY THE MOST HILARIOUS ANIMAL? WOULD YOU GIVE US A FEW MORE EXAMPLES?\nDevageet, this is more like you. The other day you were asking about death. That is not at all a reflection of your individuality. You are a man who can understand laughter as one of the most religious qualities. It has never been accepted by any religion as a religious quality.\nBut I am never in agreement with any superstition, howsoever old and ancient it may be. And I don’t care at all what others have believed, lived. I trust my own experience more than any holy scripture, more than any great saint or sage.\nMy experience about laughter is that it is the most purifying, the most healthy, the most rejuvenating, the most refreshing, and the most total experience. It can be your first experience of totality. You can laugh totally.\nAnd another beautiful thing about it, it is not only of the mind. Mind may trigger it, but soon it spreads all over you. It is overwhelming. There are beauties upon beauties as far as laughter is concerned. When you are laughing, one of the greatest things is that mind cannot think. And if you are alert, you can experience a space of no-thought, which is the experience of meditation.\nAnd laughter gives you a childlike innocence. It helps to unburden you of unnecessary seriousness, which all the religions have been burdening you with. They have taken away even the smiles from your lips – what to say about laughter? They have been preaching seriousness. They are afraid, as if God will feel offended if you laugh.\nAnd I cannot conceive of God in any other position, in any other posture, than laughing. If he exists at all, he must be laughing twenty-four hours at the hilariousness of humanity; because we don’t know the whole of humanity, we know only a few people here and there. God must be watching all over humanity, and so many circuses going on.\nFriedrich Nietzsche said, “God is dead.” But the question is, “Who killed him? Or what was the disease, if he died naturally?” Sometimes I have this idea: perhaps laughing since eternity, he popped off. There is a limit to everything. You must all feel compassionate towards poor God.\nBut in another way, he enjoyed more than anybody else. He may have been disturbed once in a while – “What kind of man have I created?”\nAnd it is a well established fact that after man he stopped creating. Seeing man, he must have become aware that, “I have committed a mistake. Now it is time to stop creation.”\nHe did not stop at horses, he did not stop at buffaloes, he did not stop at millions of species of birds and insects and animals and trees. But suddenly the day he created man – since then, nothing has been heard about him. He became so much worried about what he had done. So either he died out of too much laughter, or he committed suicide, seeing what these creatures are doing whom he has created in his own image.\nDevageet, a beautiful young woman is strolling through the zoo, and finally stops in front of the monkey cage. Seeing no monkeys around, she asks the keeper, “Where are all the monkeys today?”\n“They are inside their house, miss,” he replies. “It is the mating season.”\n“Will they come out if I throw them some peanuts?” she asks.\nThe keeper scratches his head and says, “I don’t know, miss. Would you?”\nThe great novelist has been locked away in a mental asylum for years. But at last there seems to be some hope of recovery. For three months he sits at his typewriter in his room, writing out a new novel. Finally he announces that it is complete and brings it to the top shrink who grabs it eagerly and starts to read: “General Jones leaped on his faithful horse and yelled, ‘Git up! Git up! Git up!’”\nThen the shrink thumbs through the rest of the book, “Why, there is nothing here but five hundred pages of Git ups!” he says.\n“I know,” says the writer. “Stubborn horse.”\nLord Dottingham returns home from fox hunting a little earlier than usual and finds Lady Dottingham in bed with his best friend, Sir Arthur Carpley. His lordship stands stiffly in the bedroom doorway and loudly berates his wife for her unfaithfulness.\nWith thunder in his voice he reminds her that he had taken her from a miserable existence in the London slums, given her a fine home with servants, expensive clothes, and jewels.\nAs Lady Dottingham is by this time crying loudly, his lordship turns his wrath on his supposed friend. “And as for you, Carpley,” he shouts, “you might at least stop while I am talking!”\nQuestion 3 BELOVED OSHO,\nTHE OTHER DAY I FELL IN LOVE WITH MILAREPA. IT WAS SO BEAUTIFUL, BUT AFTER TEN MINUTES IT WAS GONE.\nOSHO, IS THIS THE WAY THINGS REALLY GO?\nLolita, I wonder that the love affair continued for as long as ten minutes. With Milarepa, things are more speedy. Of course, this is the way things really go. But with Milarepa they go with express speed. His love affairs are just hit and run.\nHe is really a great guy – my musician. Only the music seems to be his really permanent love affair. Everything else is just on the margin. And ten minutes are more than enough. And he never repeats any mistakes; he commits mistakes every day, but always new ones.\nI sometimes have thought about the word ‘mistake’. Who made that word? That’s what he goes on doing. Take this Miss, take that Miss. He understands exactly the meaning of the word ‘mistakes’.\nBut for you, Lolita, I feel really sad. But there is no problem. Here there are almost all Milarepas. My people are the unfit people of the world; this is a gathering of the unfits. But they fit with each other perfectly well, so don’t be worried, fall in love again. Remember the American motto, “Try it again, and again, and again.”\nI don’t know if it is going to happen ever, but the trying is beautiful in itself. Hoping that it is going to happen keeps you alive, keeps you young. The day a woman thinks it is not going to happen, she becomes old. And no woman wants to become old.\nI have heard ... A politician was asking a friend at a meeting of women, “How do I keep them quiet just for five minutes? Because I feel so embarrassed – I am delivering my election campaign speech and they are all talking. Nobody is listening. But they are voters so I have to talk to them, but how to keep them quiet?”\nThe friend said, “It is not difficult. The first thing is that you should shout loudly, ‘Who is the oldest of you all?’ Then there will be utter silence, and in that silence deliver your speech.”\nThey say that a woman takes at least six years passing from thirty-five to thirty-six. So don’t be worried. You are young and you have the tremendously beautiful name of Lolita, a romantic name. I think some other Milarepa is going to meet you after this meeting. Many Milarepas may be thinking, “Who is this Lolita?” Even Milarepa himself may be thinking, “Have I committed a mistake?” But this is the way things happen.\nDuring the geography class, the teacher looks at little Ernie and says, “What is the matter, Ernest? Why are you looking so unhappy?”\n“I didn’t get no breakfast,” Ernie replies.\n“You poor dear, but to get on with our geography lesson ...” says the teacher pointing to the map, “where is the Mexican border?”\n“In bed with Mama,” says Ernie. “That’s why I didn’t get no breakfast.”\nMrs. Applebottom becomes angry with the French maid and after a series of stinging remarks about her abilities, she dismisses her. But the French girl will not allow such abuse to go unanswered. “Your husband,” she cries, “considers me a better cook and housekeeper than you, madam! He told me so himself.”\nMrs. Applebottom looks at the girl scornfully and makes no comment. “Also,” says the angry girl, “I am better than you in bed!”\n“And I suppose,” snaps Mrs. Applebottom, “my husband told you that too!” “No madam,” says the maid, “the chauffeur told me that.”\nBut in a way, Lolita, you are fortunate that you got rid of Milarepa in just ten minutes. I know a few other great lovers who got into trouble with Milarepa and for years they went dragging on. And Milarepa is not the one to look back.\nA man pinned under his wrecked car is being questioned by a policeman. “Are you married?” asks the cop.\n“No,” replies the man, “this is the worst fix I have ever been in.”\nAnd you are out of the worst fix. Rejoice. But never stop falling in love because unless you fall in love, how are you going to rise again? Falling is a strategy of rising again and again. Finally, when you are risen the way Jesus Christ has risen, there will be no need to fall again with any Milarepa.\nLove is good, love is nice – even for ten minutes. Don’t count the minutes. A single minute of love is equal to eternity; ten minutes is equal to ten eternities.\nTry my other Milarepas, Lolita. It is a little difficult, because other Lolitas have already made them so fed up that the moment they see anybody coming closer to them to fall in love, they escape. Any excuse and they fly away.\nI am receiving letters every day from my sannyasins asking, “What has happened to your male sannyasins? In the whole world it is the man who hangs around a woman, chases her. In your commune it is just the opposite. It is the woman who has to chase the man and the man seems to be utterly enlightened.”\nBut the men are enlightened because of you all – poor sannyasins have never been chased by so many women. So rather than getting into another hell of an affair, they simply close their eyes.\nEven a man like Devageet is thinking of dying. I did not tell the real reason that day, but I cannot keep any secrets!\nOkay, Maneesha?\nYes, Osho.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"3607","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/sat_chit_anand/part7/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/sat_chit_anand/>Sat Chit Anand</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">7 A bird with two wings</h1><div class=post-meta>17 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;3607 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Sat_Chit_Anand/part7.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part6>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

just like any other ordinary dialect. But I insist on my difference.</p><p><br></p><p>I want to know why their insistence is for Sanskrit to be a living
language used by ordinary people. They think if a language is not used
by ordinary people then it loses something of importance, it is a dead
language. Certainly it has never been used by the people, but it is not
a dead language.</p><p><br></p><p>It is a language of the mystics. It is the language of those who
know. It is not worldly, that’s true. It is something otherworldly, and
this is not a criticism. In fact, this is the extraordinariness of the
language, that it was only used by a very few people of tremendous
understanding. Their each</p><p>word has immense significance, because it is coming out of a deep
experience of reality of their own being.</p><p><br></p><p>The so-called living languages are mundane. They are for the
marketplace, for day-to-day use: naturally, they cannot contain
something of the beyond. Perhaps Sanskrit is the only language ... and
it is also the mother language of all the civilized languages of the
world.</p><p><br></p><p>It is rare in the sense that the people who formulated it were not
thinking of the material side of existence, but were more concerned that
the words used would reflect something of consciousness, heights of
consciousness, of love, of compassion, of ecstasy. Their words are
mantras, sacred. They are coming from the very source of our life. It is
possible.</p><p><br></p><p>Vimal, you say, “sat-chit-anand ... Meaning or no meaning, just the
sound of it touches my heart deeply.” It is a soundless sound; or, in
other words, the sound of silence, the sound of ultimate experience, the
sound when you are no more – only the universe remains. Certainly you
can avoid meaning. You can say “meaning or no meaning,” because meaning
is of the mind.</p><p><br></p><p>But Sat-Chit-Anand has a significance which goes far higher than
meaning. It is just a fragrance which has left the flower. The flower is
visible – part of this world, part of matter – but the fragrance, you
cannot catch hold of it. You can feel it, it can touch you deeply. It
can reach to your innermost core, but still you cannot figure out the
meaning of it. You cannot figure it out, what it is in reality.</p><p><br></p><p>The meaning is irrelevant here; significance becomes the relevance.
Not that it has no meaning, but basically it has only significance. And
the significance is that the very sound, Sat-Chit-Anand penetrates into
the heart, breaking all the barriers and all the bars and all the
defense measures. It resounds within your being, creating a subtle
harmony, a deep peace, a strange feeling of fulfillment, of being at
ease with the world, with the universe, with existence itself – at ease
not only with existence, but with yourself too.</p><p><br></p><p>It is a pure silence, as if water can be condensed into ice, and the
ice can be again melted into water. That is the reality of such
beautiful sounds. They can be condensed into meaning, but their basic
reality is to melt within you and to reach to each fiber of your being,
to each cell, to give it a dance.</p><p><br></p><p>These are the mystic sounds. They are very few. I have talked to you
about satyam-shivam- sundram, sat-chit-anand, hari om tat sat, om mani
padme hum, om-shantih-shantih-shantih. These five I have chosen as the
most significant, as the most deep-going. I will try to give you the
meaning also, because that meaning will help the significance to become
deeper. That meaning will not only touch your heart, it will also touch
your intelligence. And you have to be touched in your totality to be
transformed.</p><p><br></p><p>I will begin with the last one. That is the sound every Eastern
scripture ends with ... om-shantih- shantih-shantih. It means “The
soundless sound, or the sound of silence: peace ... peace ... peace</p><p>...” Just giving you the sense of the whole scripture in these few
telegraphic words. Every scripture in the East ends with the same. It
may be Hindu, it may be Buddhist, it may be Jaina – it doesn’t
matter.</p><p>They are all different in their philosophies. They are all different
in their theologies. They are different religions continuously in
controversy for at least ten thousand years. But strangely, they all end
their scriptures with the sound of silence: peace ... peace ... peace
... It seems they are all different roots of this experience.</p><p><br></p><p>They may differ about their roots, about the description of their
roots. They may quarrel, they may contradict each other, but as far as
the end is concerned, when they reach to the highest peak of
consciousness, all that is found is the sound of silence and utter
peace, so deep that they have to repeat it three times: peace ... peace
... peace ...</p><p><br></p><p>The fourth is used by the Tibetans, although it takes almost all the
words from Sanskrit: om mani padme hum. It is a very mystic statement.
It says, “The diamond in the lotus ... the sound of silence.” You cannot
conceive a more beautiful thing than a beautiful diamond in the most
beautiful flower on the earth, the lotus. They are trying to convey to
you the beyond in some way comprehensible to the mind: the sound of
silence – om – the diamond in the lotus. I have loved it from my very
childhood. Just the words, “the diamond in the lotus ...” They have
managed in the most beautiful way to express the beyond.</p><p><br></p><p>And the third is hari om tat sat: “the sound of silence ... this is
the only truth.” And the second is, sat-chit-anand: “truth,
consciousness, bliss.”</p><p>And the first is, satyam-shivam-sundram: “truth, godliness,
beauty.”</p><p><br></p><p>These five I can say to you belong to the universal religious
consciousness, not to any organized religion, because they have come
from individual mystics. They have poured their heart, they have poured
their enlightenment, they have poured their awakening into these five
mantras.</p><p><br></p><p>There is no word in English to translate mantra. It means a sacred
word, not of any use in the day-to-day life experiences, but only
significant when you go beyond this visible world and enter into the
invisible consciousness. A mantra is a secret key. It opens the door to
the ultimate.</p><p><br></p><p>But the meaning, Vimal, is also significant, because you are in the
mind. The sound may have gone deeper into your heart, thrilled you, but
still it is good not to leave the mind completely out of your
experience; because it can become a disturbance, it can become very
vengeful.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t antagonize your mind. It can disturb everything. Have you
watched how it disturbs your body? When you are in anger your whole body
is disturbed: your stomach is disturbed, your blood pressure goes high,
you start suddenly perspiring – even in an air-conditioned place. There
have been many cases of heart attack in intense anger. The heart
suddenly stops. The mind can disturb the body on one hand: it can
disturb the heart on another hand. Very few people know its disturbances
in the heart because that is not a common experience.</p><p><br></p><p>But if you don’t know the meaning, if the mind is not satisfied, soon
it will start creating suspicion, doubt, skepticism. Soon it will start
saying to you that you are being irrational, and you will be affected.
And the impact of Sat-Chit-Anand on your heart will start disappearing
if the mind is not in cooperation.</p><p>My whole effort is to transform your total being, not leaving
anything outside, because nature does not intend it so. And when the
mind can be persuaded to go along with you, there is no need to create
an opposition. I am against creating any kind of unnecessary conflict
and split in your being. It is better to create a bridge between mind,
body and being.</p><p><br></p><p>And the meaning is also tremendously beautiful. Sat means truth. And
the longest search of man has been for that, because without knowing the
truth, we know nothing. Truth is the very meaning of our existence.
Without knowing truth we are just accidental, we don’t have any
meaning.</p><p><br></p><p>Perhaps something has gone wrong in nature and we are the product of
it – freaks. Unless you know the meaning of yourself, you cannot have a
deep relationship with the cosmos. The meaning is going to become a
bridge with the cosmos. And unless you feel some meaning, some truth in
your being, you are not yet aware of a deep communion with the
whole.</p><p><br></p><p>Truth is the experience of being in deep communion with the eternity
of existence, and with the wholeness and the perfection and the grandeur
and the magnificence of that which is.</p><p><br></p><p>Truth simply means that which is. It is pure isness.</p><p>And the revelation of this truth to you is only possible if your
chit, your consciousness, rises to its ultimate flowering.</p><p><br></p><p>It is consciousness that is going to discover the truth. Hence,
meditation is emphasized. Meditation will not give you the truth, it
will give you more and more consciousness, and finally, consciousness
gives you two things: on one hand, truth, and on the other hand, a
tremendous bliss. You become almost like a bird with two wings. Truth is
your one wing, bliss is your other wing. And you are pure
consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>In this experience you can fly like an eagle across the sun into the
unknown. Then this whole universe belongs to you. Then wherever you are,
you are at home. Then whatever you are, you are in utter peace. Then
whatever happens is beautiful and brings tremendous gratitude to
you.</p><p><br></p><p>Prayer becomes your very heartbeat. You don’t pray in synagogues and
in churches and in temples and mosques. Those are for the irreligious.
Those are for the hypocrites. Those are for the pretenders. The
authentic religious man has prayer in his heartbeats. He is continuously
feeling a tremendous gratitude to all that existence has made available
to us – life ... love ... laughter ...</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>IS MAN REALLY THE MOST HILARIOUS ANIMAL? WOULD YOU GIVE US A FEW MORE
EXAMPLES?</p><p>Devageet, this is more like you. The other day you were asking about
death. That is not at all a reflection of your individuality. You are a
man who can understand laughter as one of the most religious qualities.
It has never been accepted by any religion as a religious quality.</p><p><br></p><p>But I am never in agreement with any superstition, howsoever old and
ancient it may be. And I don’t care at all what others have believed,
lived. I trust my own experience more than any holy scripture, more than
any great saint or sage.</p><p><br></p><p>My experience about laughter is that it is the most purifying, the
most healthy, the most rejuvenating, the most refreshing, and the most
total experience. It can be your first experience of totality. You can
laugh totally.</p><p><br></p><p>And another beautiful thing about it, it is not only of the mind.
Mind may trigger it, but soon it spreads all over you. It is
overwhelming. There are beauties upon beauties as far as laughter is
concerned. When you are laughing, one of the greatest things is that
mind cannot think. And if you are alert, you can experience a space of
no-thought, which is the experience of meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>And laughter gives you a childlike innocence. It helps to unburden
you of unnecessary seriousness, which all the religions have been
burdening you with. They have taken away even the smiles from your lips
– what to say about laughter? They have been preaching seriousness. They
are afraid, as if God will feel offended if you laugh.</p><p><br></p><p>And I cannot conceive of God in any other position, in any other
posture, than laughing. If he exists at all, he must be laughing
twenty-four hours at the hilariousness of humanity; because we don’t
know the whole of humanity, we know only a few people here and there.
God must be watching all over humanity, and so many circuses going
on.</p><p><br></p><p>Friedrich Nietzsche said, “God is dead.” But the question is, “Who
killed him? Or what was the disease, if he died naturally?” Sometimes I
have this idea: perhaps laughing since eternity, he popped off. There is
a limit to everything. You must all feel compassionate towards poor
God.</p><p><br></p><p>But in another way, he enjoyed more than anybody else. He may have
been disturbed once in a while – “What kind of man have I created?”</p><p><br></p><p>And it is a well established fact that after man he stopped creating.
Seeing man, he must have become aware that, “I have committed a mistake.
Now it is time to stop creation.”</p><p><br></p><p>He did not stop at horses, he did not stop at buffaloes, he did not
stop at millions of species of birds and insects and animals and trees.
But suddenly the day he created man – since then, nothing has been heard
about him. He became so much worried about what he had done. So either
he died out of too much laughter, or he committed suicide, seeing what
these creatures are doing whom he has created in his own image.</p><p><br></p><p>Devageet, a beautiful young woman is strolling through the zoo, and
finally stops in front of the monkey cage. Seeing no monkeys around, she
asks the keeper, “Where are all the monkeys today?”</p><p><br></p><p>“They are inside their house, miss,” he replies. “It is the mating
season.”</p><p>“Will they come out if I throw them some peanuts?” she asks.</p><p><br></p><p>The keeper scratches his head and says, “I don’t know, miss. Would
you?”</p><p><br></p><p>The great novelist has been locked away in a mental asylum for years.
But at last there seems to be some hope of recovery. For three months he
sits at his typewriter in his room, writing out a new novel. Finally he
announces that it is complete and brings it to the top shrink who grabs
it eagerly and starts to read: “General Jones leaped on his faithful
horse and yelled, ‘Git up! Git up! Git up!’”</p><p><br></p><p>Then the shrink thumbs through the rest of the book, “Why, there is
nothing here but five hundred pages of Git ups!” he says.</p><p><br></p><p>“I know,” says the writer. “Stubborn horse.”</p><p><br></p><p>Lord Dottingham returns home from fox hunting a little earlier than
usual and finds Lady Dottingham in bed with his best friend, Sir Arthur
Carpley. His lordship stands stiffly in the bedroom doorway and loudly
berates his wife for her unfaithfulness.</p><p><br></p><p>With thunder in his voice he reminds her that he had taken her from a
miserable existence in the London slums, given her a fine home with
servants, expensive clothes, and jewels.</p><p><br></p><p>As Lady Dottingham is by this time crying loudly, his lordship turns
his wrath on his supposed friend. “And as for you, Carpley,” he shouts,
“you might at least stop while I am talking!”</p><p><br></p><p>Question 3 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>THE OTHER DAY I FELL IN LOVE WITH MILAREPA. IT WAS SO BEAUTIFUL, BUT
AFTER TEN MINUTES IT WAS GONE.</p><p><br></p><p>OSHO, IS THIS THE WAY THINGS REALLY GO?</p><p><br></p><p>Lolita, I wonder that the love affair continued for as long as ten
minutes. With Milarepa, things are more speedy. Of course, this is the
way things really go. But with Milarepa they go with express speed. His
love affairs are just hit and run.</p><p><br></p><p>He is really a great guy – my musician. Only the music seems to be
his really permanent love affair. Everything else is just on the margin.
And ten minutes are more than enough. And he never repeats any mistakes;
he commits mistakes every day, but always new ones.</p><p><br></p><p>I sometimes have thought about the word ‘mistake’. Who made that
word? That’s what he goes on doing. Take this Miss, take that Miss. He
understands exactly the meaning of the word ‘mistakes’.</p><p><br></p><p>But for you, Lolita, I feel really sad. But there is no problem. Here
there are almost all Milarepas. My people are the unfit people of the
world; this is a gathering of the unfits. But they fit with each other
perfectly well, so don’t be worried, fall in love again. Remember the
American motto, “Try it again, and again, and again.”</p><p>I don’t know if it is going to happen ever, but the trying is
beautiful in itself. Hoping that it is going to happen keeps you alive,
keeps you young. The day a woman thinks it is not going to happen, she
becomes old. And no woman wants to become old.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard ... A politician was asking a friend at a meeting of
women, “How do I keep them quiet just for five minutes? Because I feel
so embarrassed – I am delivering my election campaign speech and they
are all talking. Nobody is listening. But they are voters so I have to
talk to them, but how to keep them quiet?”</p><p><br></p><p>The friend said, “It is not difficult. The first thing is that you
should shout loudly, ‘Who is the oldest of you all?’ Then there will be
utter silence, and in that silence deliver your speech.”</p><p><br></p><p>They say that a woman takes at least six years passing from
thirty-five to thirty-six. So don’t be worried. You are young and you
have the tremendously beautiful name of Lolita, a romantic name. I think
some other Milarepa is going to meet you after this meeting. Many
Milarepas may be thinking, “Who is this Lolita?” Even Milarepa himself
may be thinking, “Have I committed a mistake?” But this is the way
things happen.</p><p><br></p><p>During the geography class, the teacher looks at little Ernie and
says, “What is the matter, Ernest? Why are you looking so unhappy?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I didn’t get no breakfast,” Ernie replies.</p><p><br></p><p>“You poor dear, but to get on with our geography lesson ...” says the
teacher pointing to the map, “where is the Mexican border?”</p><p><br></p><p>“In bed with Mama,” says Ernie. “That’s why I didn’t get no
breakfast.”</p><p><br></p><p>Mrs. Applebottom becomes angry with the French maid and after a
series of stinging remarks about her abilities, she dismisses her. But
the French girl will not allow such abuse to go unanswered. “Your
husband,” she cries, “considers me a better cook and housekeeper than
you, madam! He told me so himself.”</p><p><br></p><p>Mrs. Applebottom looks at the girl scornfully and makes no comment.
“Also,” says the angry girl, “I am better than you in bed!”</p><p>“And I suppose,” snaps Mrs. Applebottom, “my husband told you that
too!” “No madam,” says the maid, “the chauffeur told me that.”</p><p>But in a way, Lolita, you are fortunate that you got rid of Milarepa
in just ten minutes. I know a few other great lovers who got into
trouble with Milarepa and for years they went dragging on. And Milarepa
is not the one to look back.</p><p>A man pinned under his wrecked car is being questioned by a
policeman. “Are you married?” asks the cop.</p><p>“No,” replies the man, “this is the worst fix I have ever been
in.”</p><p><br></p><p>And you are out of the worst fix. Rejoice. But never stop falling in
love because unless you fall in love, how are you going to rise again?
Falling is a strategy of rising again and again. Finally, when you are
risen the way Jesus Christ has risen, there will be no need to fall
again with any Milarepa.</p><p><br></p><p>Love is good, love is nice – even for ten minutes. Don’t count the
minutes. A single minute of love is equal to eternity; ten minutes is
equal to ten eternities.</p><p><br></p><p>Try my other Milarepas, Lolita. It is a little difficult, because
other Lolitas have already made them so fed up that the moment they see
anybody coming closer to them to fall in love, they escape. Any excuse
and they fly away.</p><p><br></p><p>I am receiving letters every day from my sannyasins asking, “What has
happened to your male sannyasins? In the whole world it is the man who
hangs around a woman, chases her. In your commune it is just the
opposite. It is the woman who has to chase the man and the man seems to
be utterly enlightened.”</p><p><br></p><p>But the men are enlightened because of you all – poor sannyasins have
never been chased by so many women. So rather than getting into another
hell of an affair, they simply close their eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>Even a man like Devageet is thinking of dying. I did not tell the
real reason that day, but I cannot keep any secrets!</p><p><br></p><p>Okay, Maneesha?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, Osho.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part6>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

‌CHAPTER 1
Just an empty passage
11 June 1980 am in Buddha Hall
THE VENERABLE MASTER SAID:
THE SUPREME TAO IS FORMLESS, YET IT PRODUCES AND NURTURES HEAVEN AND EARTH.
THE SUPREME TAO HAS NO DESIRES, YET BY ITS POWER THE SUN AND MOON REVOLVE IN THEIR ORBITS.
THE SUPREME TAO IS NAMELESS, YET IT EVER SUPPORTS ALL THINGS. I DO NOT KNOW ITS NAME BUT FOR TITLE CALL IT TAO.</description>

‌CHAPTER 10
Saying Yes to Life
20 June 1980 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1 OSHO,
WHY CAN’T I SAY YES TO MYSELF? I HAVE THE FEELING THAT ALL MY MISERY IS ROOTED IN THIS INCAPACITY.
ANAND RENATA,
It is one of the greatest problems. Every human being has to face it, because the whole society up to now has been based on self-condemnation.</description>

‌CHAPTER 2
Existence is God’s expression
12 June 1980 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1 OSHO,
COULD YOU SAY SOMETHING ABOUT DISCIPLINE AND REPRESSION? ANUDEYA,
They are as distinct as the earth and the sky. The distance is so great between the two, that it is unbridgeable. Repression is just the opposite of discipline, but for thousands of years repression has been misunderstood and thought of as if it were discipline.</description>

‌CHAPTER 3
Grow Real Roses
13 June 1980 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1 OSHO,
WHAT IS THE SECRET OF REMAINING HAPPY AND MARRIED? SARJAN,
It is impossible! It has never happened – it cannot happen in the very nature of things. Marriage is something against nature. Marriage is an imposition, an invention of man – certainly out of necessity, but now even that necessity is out of date.</description>

‌CHAPTER 4
Discover your own God
14 June 1980 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1 OSHO,
PLEASE TALK ABOUT PEOPLE LIKE BERTOLT BRECHT WHO REJECT RELIGION AND SPIRITUALITY AND YET WHOSE POWERFUL CREATIVE LOVE SHINES LIKE AN ANGRY LIGHT IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY.
TIM GREEN,
Religion for centuries has become associated with a life-negative attitude, and obviously any life negative attitude cannot be creative; it becomes intrinsically impossible for it to be creative.</description>

‌CHAPTER 5
A World Inside You
15 June 1980 am in Buddha Hall
THE VENERABLE MASTER SAID:
TAO MANIFESTS BOTH AS THE PURE AND THE TURBID, BOTH AS MOVEMENT AND STILLNESS.
HEAVEN IS PURE, EARTH IS TURBID. HEAVEN MOVES, EARTH IS STILL.
THE MASCULINE IS PURE, THE FEMININE IS TURBID. THE MASCULINE IS ACTIVE, THE FEMININE IS PASSIVE.
MANIFESTING FROM ITS RADICAL ESSENCE, TAO FLOWS FORTH EVEN TO THE LAST OF THINGS, BRINGING FORTH HEAVEN AND EARTH AND ALL THAT IS IN BETWEEN.</description>

‌CHAPTER 6
The Taste of Eternity
16 June 1980 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1 OSHO,
PLEASE EXPLAIN HOW I CAN MEDITATE OVER SOMETHING WITHOUT USING MY MIND. DINESH,
Meditation has nothing to do with mind; meditation simply means a state of no-mind. The functioning of the mind is the only disturbance in meditation. If you are trying to achieve meditation THROUGH mind you are bound to fail, doomed to fail.</description>

‌CHAPTER 7
Into the Open Sky
17 June 1980 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1 OSHO,
ARE CHILDREN REALLY SO INTELLIGENT AS YOU ALWAYS SAY THEY ARE? GAUTAMI,
Intelligence is not something that is acquired, it is inbuilt, it is inborn, it is intrinsic to life itself. Not only children are intelligent, animals are intelligent in their own way, trees are intelligent in their own way.</description>

‌CHAPTER 8
Now Here
18 June 1980 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1 OSHO,
I AM A JUDGE. HAVE I ANY CHANCE OF EVER ENTERING NIRVANA? IF YOU ANSWER IS NO, THEN I CAN CHANGE MY PROFESSION; I CAN BECOME A DOCTOR. I AM ALSO TRAINED AS A HOMEOPATH.
JAGDIT SINGH,
There is no record of any judge ever entering nirvana.</description>

‌CHAPTER 9
Tao Takes Care
19 June 1980 am in Buddha Hall
THE VENERABLE MASTER SAID:
WHEN MAN ATTAINS THE POWER TO TRANSCEND THAT WHICH CHANGES, ABIDING IN PURITY AND STILLNESS, HEAVEN AND EARTH ARE UNITED IN HIM.
THE SOUL OF MAN LOVES PURITY, BUT HIS MIND IS OFTEN REBELLIOUS. THE MIND OF MAN LOVES STILLNESS, BUT HIS DESIRES DRAW HIM INTO ACTIVITY. WHEN A MAN IS CONSTANTLY ABLE TO GOVERN HIS DESIRES, HIS MIND BECOMES SPONTANEOUSLY STILL.</description>

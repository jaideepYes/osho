THE MIND OF MAN LOVES STILLNESS, BUT HIS DESIRES DRAW HIM INTO ACTIVITY. WHEN A MAN IS CONSTANTLY ABLE TO GOVERN HIS DESIRES, HIS MIND BECOMES SPONTANEOUSLY STILL. WHEN THE MIND IS UNCLOUDED, THE SOUL IS SEEN TO BE PURE. THEN, WITH CERTAINTY THE SIX DESIRES WILL CEASE TO BE BEGOTTEN AND THE THREE POISONS WILL BE ELIMINATED AND DISSOLVED.\nTHE REASON MEN DO NOT POSSESS THE ABILITY TO ACHIEVE THIS IS BECAUSE THEIR MINDS ARE NOT CLEAR AND THEIR DESIRES ARE UNRESTRAINED.\nHE WHO HAS THE POWER TO TRANSCEND HIS DESIRES, LOOKING WITHIN AND CONTEMPLATING MIND, REALIZES THAT IN HIS MIND, MIND IS NOT; LOOKING WITHOUT AND CONTEMPLATING FORM, HE REALIZES THAT IN FORM, FORM IS NOT; LOOKING AT THINGS STILL MORE REMOTE AND CONTEMPLATING MATTER, HE REALIZES THAT IN MATTER, MATTER IS NOT.\nTao believes in spontaneity – not in cultivating virtues, not in creating a character, not even in conscience, they are all ego efforts, and ego is against Tao. Tao is a state of let-go: to be in\ntune with existence with such totality that there is no separation at all. You are not even the part, you are the whole. You are not the wave but the ocean itself. Hence there is no question of doing. Tao means being.\nAll other so-called religions insist on doing. They believe in commandments: “Do this, don’t do that.” They have many shoulds and should nots. The Buddhist scriptures have thirty-three thousand rules for a monk; even to remember them is impossible. People forget even what the Ten Commandments are – how can they remember thirty-three thousand rules? Their whole life will be wasted only in remembering them. When are they going to cultivate these rules? It will take millions of lives.\nMaybe because of this the idea of many many lives became so significant in the East, because time is needed to cultivate. One life is not enough – even a thousand lives will not be enough – you need millions of lives to cultivate all this. In fact, the whole approach helps you to go on postponing. The tomorrow becomes bigger and bigger, almost infinite, and the today is so small that you can deceive yourself, you can say to yourself, “Let me remain whatsoever I am today; tomorrow I will change. And today, anyway, is so small, nothing much is possible. I will start tomorrow.” Of course the tomorrow never comes; it is there only in the imagination.\nTao believes in this moment; Tao has no idea of future. If you can live this moment in purity, in silence, in spontaneity, then your life is transformed. Not that you transform it: Tao transforms it, the whole transforms it. You simply allow the river to take you to the ocean; you need not push the river.\nBut when such great truths are put into language, difficulties arise because our language is made by us. It is not made by people like Lao Tzu, Chuang Tzu, Lieh Tzu, Ko Hsuan, it is made by the mediocre people the world is full of. Obviously, language is their invention and it carries their meanings, their attitudes towards life. So whatsoever you say is going to be somewhere inadequate – not only inadequate but deep down wrong also.\nThis has to be remembered, and even more so about these sutras because these sutras were written originally in Chinese. Chinese is a language totally different from any other language, it is the most difficult language in the world for the simple reason that it has no alphabet, it is a pictorial language. Pictorial languages are the most ancient languages; they must have come from the very dawn of human consciousness, because when man is a child he thinks in pictures, he cannot think in words, so his language is pictorial. That’s why in children’s books there are so many colored pictures; the text is not much but pictures are many. The child is not interested in the text, he is interested in the pictures. Looking at the picture of the mango, a very juicy colorful mango, he may become interested to know what it is called, how it is written, and he may read the text – only a few words about the mango. Slowly slowly the mango disappears, giving place to language. In the university books pictures disappear completely. The more scholarly a book is, the less is the possibility of pictures; all is language. In your sleep you still dream not in a linguistic way but in a pictorial way because in your sleep you again become a child.\nChinese is a dream language – and we know the difficulty with the dreams. You have dreamed something, but in the morning you cannot figure out what it means. You will need an expert to interpret it, and even experts won’t agree. The Freudian will say one thing, the Jungian will say something else, the Adlerian may say just the opposite. And now there are many more new trends, new schools of psychoanalysis, and they all have their interpretations. And whomsoever you are\nreading will look valid, reasonable, because they can all provide great rationalizations The dream is yours, but you don’t know what it means because a dream can mean many things; a dream is multi-dimensional.\nAnd that’s the difficulty with the Chinese language: it is a dream language, a pictorial language – each picture can mean many things. Hence there are translations of Chinese scriptures, many translations, and no two translations ever agree, because a picture can be interpreted in as many ways as there are people to interpret it. The Chinese language is only symbolic; it indicates. It is very poetic, it is not like arithmetic.\nIf you remember this, only then will you not fall into the trap in which almost all the scholars have fallen.\nThese sutras were not written in an alphabetical language so whatsoever is being said in these sutras is an interpretation. And I myself don’t agree in many places; if I were to translate it it would be a totally different translation. I will tell you where I differ and why\nTHE VENERABLE MASTER SAID:\nWHEN MAN ATTAINS THE POWER TO TRANSCEND THAT WHICH CHANGES... HEAVEN AND EARTH ARE UNITED IN HIM.\nThe first thing that’s absolutely wrong is the idea of attainment. Tao does not believe that you have to attain anything or that you CAN attain anything. You are already that which you can be: nothing more can be attained. The very idea of attainment, of achievement is alien to the Taoist approach. There is nothing to attain, nothing to achieve. The idea of attainment and achievement is rooted in our egos. The ego is always ambitious; it can’t be otherwise. Either it has to attain worldly things or it has to attain other-worldly powers, SIDDHIS, but something has to be attained. The ego lives by attaining.\nAnd Tao says the ego has to be dissolved, you cannot be allowed to be ambitious – to be ambitious is to go against Tao. Tao teaches non-ambitiousness. You have just to be yourself as you are. You are already perfect; you have never left your perfection for a single moment. You are already in Tao; it is just that you have started dreaming that you have lost it, that you have gone far away.\nIt is just like as in your sleep you remain in your room, in your bed, but you can dream of faraway places. You can visit the moon and Mars, you can go to the stars, but in the morning you will find you have not left your bed, not even for a single moment.\nWhen one becomes conscious one becomes aware of the whole ridiculousness of all the achievements and failures. It is the idea of achievement that brings failure, frustration in its wake. If you succeed it brings ego. Ego is misery because the more ego you have the more you think that you are separate from the whole, that you have become somebody special, unique, superior, higher, holier, that you don’t belong to the ordinary world, that you are a saint, a mahatma. If you fail, then there is frustration; that brings pain, that brings anguish. Whatsoever happens, success or failure, you will suffer. Ego brings suffering; whether it succeeds or fails makes no difference. Hence with the Taoist approach this idea of attainment is totally wrong – remember it.\nThe translator says:\nWHEN MAN ATTAINS THE POWER...\nAgain the word “power” is not right because Tao does not believe in power. It believes, really, in utter powerlessness, because when you are powerful you are fighting against the whole. Adolf Hitler is powerful, Alexander the Great is powerful, Ivan the Terrible is powerful; Genghis Khan, Tamburlaine, these are powerful people, but they are fighting against nature, spontaneity.\nJesus is not powerful, Jesus is utterly powerless. When Jesus was crucified his disciples were waiting: “Now is the time he will show his power.” The enemies were waiting, the friends were waiting for the same thing: “Now he is going to show his miraculous power, now he will prove that he is the only begotten son of God.” He didn’t prove anything, he simply died. He died like any mortal – he died like the two thieves who were crucified with him. He was just in the middle; on either side of him there was a thief. The enemies were frustrated, the friends were frustrated even more. What happened? Where had his power gone? And he was always talking about being the son of God... But to be the son of God simply means to be utterly powerless.\nHow we go on misunderstanding people like Jesus, Lao Tzu, Ko Hsuan! Our misunderstanding is almost infinite. He surrendered to God. Yes, for a moment he himself had become aware of all the expectations. Almost one-hundred thousand people had gathered to see; friends were very few. He must have seen the expectation in people’s eyes – they were expecting miracles. Great things were going to happen – something that only happens once in thousands of years. For a moment he may have been impressed, hypnotized by so much attention, by so much expectation. The whole atmosphere must have been charged with only one desire: to see his power.\nAnd he asked God, “Have you forsaken me?” But then immediately he understood – he was a man of intelligence, tremendous intelligence. Immediately he understood that whatsoever he has said is wrong. How can God forsake him? The very idea that God can forsake him is negative, is ugly; it is not trust.\nIf God shows miracles, then it is very easy to trust. If he is proving your power then it is very easy to trust; anybody will be able to trust. No intelligence is needed to trust, no special understanding is needed to trust; any fool would have trusted.\nBut nothing was happening and the last moment has arrived. Jesus immediately understood the point – this is the time to understand. He surrendered. He said: Thy kingdom come, thy will be done. Don’t listen to me, you simply go on doing whatsoever you want to do. Who am I to suggest? I am no more, I am in your hands.\nThis was real powerlessness. This is Tao. Ko Hsuan would have understood it; the Jews could not understand it. And the whole gathering was of Jews, friends or enemies. And they had always believed in achievement, in power, in ambition – all their prophets had been doing miracles. If they were angry with Jesus the reason was that he was not coming up to the mark: he was not proving himself to be really a prophet, because the ancient prophets had done so many miracles.\nAnd my feeling is that he never did any miracles. If he had done any miracles, all the Jews would have converted; they would not have crucified him. It is enough proof that he never did any miracles.\nAnd all the miracles that are propounded by the Christians are invented. These Christians are also of the same mind, the same desire, the same ambition: “How can Our Lord be without miracles? If ordinary prophets were doing so many things, how can Our Lord be without miracles?” So they have invented even better miracles, greater miracles than those of all the prophets.\nBut my feeling is that Jesus was a man of Tao. He was really a man who can be called religious.\nI have heard a beautiful story. It is not recorded anywhere. It must have gone from one Master to another, just by word of mouth: that Moses, Abraham, Ezekiel, three ancient prophets, were sitting under a tree in heaven talking about great things, talking about the Old Testament. Then suddenly Abraham said, “We know everything about the Old Testament. Had Jesus been here he would have told us something about the New Testament.”\nMoses laughed and he called a boy who was sitting just by the side of the tree and said, “Jesus, please go and bring three cups of coffee for us.”\nAbraham was shocked. This is Jesus? And Jesus went to bring three cups of coffee for the old prophets.\nBut I love this story. Only Jesus can do that – so utterly powerless. His powerlessness is his miracle: he has annihilated himself totally. They were not even aware of his presence, that he is sitting by the side of the tree. He didn’t say a single word: that “I am Jesus Christ, the only begotten son of God. And what are you saying? I should go and bring three cups of coffee for you? You go yourself! Is this the way to talk to the son of God?” But he simply went.\nOnly Jesus can do it, or Lao Tzu or Ko Hsuan or Bodhidharma or Basho. These are people who have dropped the whole power trip, the whole number.\nKo Hsuan cannot mean what the translation will create in your mind. It says: WHEN MAN ATTAINS THE POWER TO TRANSCEND THAT WHICH CHANGES...\nNo. If I were to translate it... I don’t know Chinese at all, but who cares? I can still translate, not knowing a single word of Chinese, because I know the spirit of Tao; that’s my experience. If I were to translate it, I would say;\nWHEN MAN SURRENDERS TO THE POWER OF TAO, HE TRANSCENDS THAT WHICH CHANGES.\nWhen man becomes utterly powerless as a separate entity, then he transcends that which changes. Then he abides in purity and stillness. Then the purity that comes to him is not something cultivated from the outside .\nIt is not something that you have to maintain continuously, that you have to guard because otherwise yOu will lose it... Your saints are continuously on guard. They know perfectly well that even if they are relaxed for a single moment they will lose all their purity. They don’t abide in it, it is not natural to them, it is something artificial, arbitrary; they have imposed it on themselves.\nYou don’t need to BREATHE, YOU need not remember to breathe; otherwise you would have been dead long before now, because any time you forget about breathing – a beautiful woman passes by and you forget about breathing – and finished! There is the full point. Then you cannot breathe again. But breathing continues even while you are asleep – not only while you are deeply asleep, even if you are in a coma breathing continues; it does not depend on you.\nOnce I went to see a woman... Her husband loved me very much. He came crying and weeping and he said, “This was my wife’s last wish, that she wanted to see you. But for nine months she has been in a coma and the doctors say there is no possibility that she will ever become conscious. But please come with me just to fulfill her last desire. That was her last desire before she became unconscious.”\nSo I went to see the woman. For nine months she had been in a coma, but she was breathing perfectly. To be in a coma means to be almost dead. And she died after three months; after remaining one year in a coma she died. But for one year she continued to breathe; her breathing was perfect, there was no disturbance in it.\nTao takes care of your breathing; it is natural. Your blood circulates continuously, day in, day out, year in, year out. For centuries man used to think that there was no circulation of the blood in the body; blood simply filled the body as water filled a pot. It is only three hundred years ago that it was discovered that blood did not just fill the body; it continuously circulates, it goes on circulating at a very great speed. That keeps your inner world alive, dynamic. Who is circulating your blood? – certainly not you, otherwise you might forget it. Who digests your food? – certainly not you. In fact, if you become very conscious of digestion you will disturb your stomach.\nTry a simple experiment for twenty-four hours: when you are eating just become conscious that the food is going into the stomach; now you have to digest it. And troubles will start: you will feel heavy and you will not know what to do, how to digest it. Just remain conscious that the food is in the stomach and it has to be digested, and you are almost incapable of doing anything. Do a few yoga exercises, stand on your head, jog, jump, and within twenty-four hours you will have a bad stomach; you will have disturbed the whole process. It does not need you at all. Once the food has gone below your throat you need not bother about it; Tao takes care of it.\nAll that is essential is natural, and to live your whole life in a natural way is the only teaching of Tao. It teaches you powerlessness, but there is great power in powerlessness – the power of God, the power of the whole, not your power, not my power, not anybody’s power.\nThen there arises a purity in you. You are not the author of it, you are not the architect of it; you are simply a witness, a watcher. And there arises a tremendous stillness, not something forced from the outside. That’s what your so-called religious people are doing all over the world: they are forcing purity. And whenever you force purity on yourself, whenever it becomes a cultivated phenomenon, it is repression and nothing else. And repression only creates ugliness; it creates a split in you, it makes you schizophrenic.\nOne priest invites another priest to lunch at his house. At the end of the meal, the guest, who is slightly drunk, notices how pretty the maid is.\nHe turns to his colleague and says, “You are an old friend, you can tell me – do you sleep with the girl?”\nThe host is very angry. “How dare you speak like this in my house?” he cries. “Please leave immediately!”\nAfter his friend has gone, the priest notices that a beautiful silver spoon has disappeared, so the following morning he sends his friend a note saying, “My dear holy friend, I am not saying that you are a thief, but if you find my silver spoon, please send it back!”\nThe answer comes quickly:\n“My dear holy friend, I am not saying that you are a liar, but if you had slept in your own bed last night, you would have found your silver spoon!”\nAll cultivated purity creates hypocrisy, it creates a duality in you. It is bound to create it because you have not understood; you have simply denied something. It has not disappeared; it is there waiting to take revenge. And it will find its own way – it will come from the back door. If you don’t allow it to come from the front door it will come from the back door.\nTao does not believe in any cultivated character; it believes in a natural purity, in a natural stillness. You must have watched how if you try to become silent then each and every thing becomes a disturbance, a distraction. Just a dog barking, who is not at all aware that you are trying to meditate, who has nothing against meditation, who is not an old enemy, who is not taking any revenge on you for some past karma... He is enjoying his barking; that is his meditation. Maybe he is doing Dynamic Meditation! He seems to be more modern and up to date than you – you are doing vipassana and he is doing Dynamic! But you will be disturbed. He is not disturbed by your vipassana and you are disturbed by his Dynamic Meditation for the simple reason that you are forcing something; it is not natural. It is just a very thin layer of stillness that somehow you have painted upon yourself. Deep down a thousand and one dogs are barking, and they immediately understand the dog barking and they start feeling a great urge to bark. The distraction comes from your inner dogs, it is not coming from the outer dog; the outer dog is not responsible at all. If your silence is natural, the dog’s barking will not be a distraction; it may even enhance your stillness, it may become a background to your stillness. That’s how it happens.\nWhen in the night you see the stars, beautiful stars have you ever thought what happens to these stars in the day? They don’t go away – where can they go? They are there, but because the background is no more there, the darkness is no more there, you cannot see them. In the night the darkness functions as a background: the darker the night, the more shining are the stars. They are not so shining on a full-moon night, but when there is no moon at all the stars are really beautiful.\nThe same is true about a real silence: everything that ordinarily proves a distraction becomes a background. The dog barking, the traffic noise somebody shouting, children crying, running, the wife cooking food in the kitchen – everything becomes a background and everything deepens your silence because you are not concentrating, you are not forcing anything; you are simply relaxed. Things go on happening, you remain untouched; you remain absolutely centered, and effortlessly centered.\nThis thing has to be remembered: Tao teaches you effortless naturalness; it does not believe in effort as Yoga does. Yoga and Tao are totally opposite to each other. That’s why Yoga could not penetrate China. Buddha impressed China for the simple reason that he also says that you should be natural, that your meditation should be effortless, that it should not be imposed from the outside, that it should arise from your innermost core. It should not be a plastic flower, it should be a real rose.\nWHEN MAN ATTAINS THE POWER TO TRANSCEND THAT WHICH CHANGES, ABIDING, IN PURITY AND STILLNESS, HEAVEN AND EARTH ARE UNITED IN HIM.\nThat’s what I call the meeting of the East and the West, the meeting of materialism and spiritualism. That’s my idea of Zorba the Buddha: HEAVEN AND EARTH ARE UNITED IN HIM.\nTao is not other-worldly like Jainism; it is not this-worldly either like Charvakas. It believes in the unity of existence; it does not divide existence in any way. Its whole vision is that of total unity, organic unity.\nHeaven and earth are one; in you they are already meeting. Your body is part of the earth, your soul is part of heaven. The meeting is already happening – you are not aware of it. If you relax you will become aware of it, and the meeting is tremendously beautiful. Earth alone is dead. That’s why a materialist philosophy of life sooner or later comes to realize that life is meaningless.\nThat’s what has happened in the West. All great thinkers of this century in the West are obsessed only with one problem: the meaning of life. And they all agree on one point at least: that life is meaningless.\nIn Dostoevsky’s famous novel, one of the most important novels ever written... If I am asked to name the ten best novels in the world, then this will be one of those ten – not only one of them but the first of those ten: THE BROTHERS KARAMAZOV. It is one of the greatest creations.\nIn THE BROTHERS KARAMAZOV one of the characters says to God, “Where are you? I want to meet you – not that I am interested in seeing you, not that I want to know about you; I simply want to give you back the ticket that you gave me to enter into this world. Please take it back! This whole world is absolutely meaningless.”\nMarcel says in one of his writings that suicide seems to be the most important metaphysical problem. If life is meaningless then of course suicide seems to be the most important metaphysical problem. Why go on living? In the past people used to think that it was only cowards who commit suicide; now the pendulum seems to have moved to the other extreme. The materialists are feeling so meaningless that the idea is arising slowly and gathering force that it is only cowards who go on living; it is the brave people who try to commit suicide. Why go on living if there is no meaning?\nBut this has happened because only earth was accepted, not the sky, not heaven. Earth is meaningless, barren; without the sky there is no soul – you are just a body, a corpse. And what meaning can a corpse have? When the soul leaves the body, meaning has left the body. And if you don’t believe in the soul then you are bound to feel sooner or later that life has no meaning. The West is feeling this great meaninglessness.\nAnd the East believed only in heaven, only in the soul, but that is an abstraction. The body is concrete, the soul is only an abstraction; it is intangible. And when you start running after intangibles, after invisibles, you lose track of all that is concrete. That’s why the East is poor, starving, ill, burdened with thousands of problems and seems to have no way of solving them for the simple reason that for centuries we have never bothered about the earth; our eyes were fixed on the sky.\nAn ancient Greek parable says:\nOne very famous astrologer was looking at the sky in the night, watching the stars, studying the stars. He lost his way, naturally, because he was not looking at the earth where he was walking, and he fell in a well. Then he became aware, but then it was too late. He started shouting,“Save me!” He was outside the village.\nAn old woman who lived nearby somehow managed to save him. When he came out he told the woman, “You may not know me, you may not recognize me in this dark night, but I will tell you who I am: I am the king’s special astrologer! It is very difficult for people even to approach me, but you can come to me. I will tell you about your future.”\nThe old woman laughed. She said, “You fool! You don’t know even where is the well and where is the road, and you will tell me about my future!”\nThat’s what has happened in the East: the East has fallen into the well, lost track of the concrete, become too metaphysical.\nTao seems to be the only life vision which is total. It does not deny the earth, it does not deny the sky. It accepts both, it accepts the unity of both. It says: The man who has come to know spontaneous purity and stillness, who has become relaxed with the whole, with the law of the ultimate – in him heaven and earth are united.\nThat’s my concept of a sannyasin too. In you I would like this meeting to happen. You will be misunderstood all over the world: in the East people will think you are materialist, in the West people will think you have become metaphysical. That means you have gone crazy, berserk, that you are talking mumbo-jumbo. They will say, “Stop all this nonsense! Be realistic, Be pragmatic.” You will be misunderstood everywhere because the East has believed only in half and the West has believed in half.\nI believe in the whole. To me to trust the whole is the only way to be holy, and to trust the whole is the only way to be whole. And when you are whole, life is bliss, life is benediction, life is a celebration.\nTHE SOUL OF MAN LOVES PURITY... BUT HIS DESIRES DRAW HIM INTO ACTIVITY,\nMan has three layers; those three layers have to be understood. The first, the deepest core, is the soul; the soul means your center of being. And the outermost circumference consists of desires. And between the two is another concentric circle, half way from both, from the outer and from the inner. It is neither outer nor inner – that is your mind.\nTHE SOUL OF MAN LOVES PURITY . .\nBy purity Ko Hsuan always means innocence, so don’t misunderstand it with any moralistic meaning of purity because Tao does not believe in any morality or any immorality: only innocence. That’s why the child is innocent, because when he is born he is just the intrinsic center; the two circles have not yet gathered around the center. That’s why every child looks so beautiful. Have you ever come across an ugly child? It is impossible. And what happens to all the beautiful children? – because if all children are beautiful then all people should be beautiful because these same children become grown up people. But somewhere on the way they all disappear; something ugly sets in. We give them wrong circumferences; we give them wrong minds, wrong desires. We create such a dichotomy in their being that they become a crowd, not a unity. They are no more integrated beings; they become fragments. And to be fragmentary is to be ugly because you lose all harmony, and without harmony there is no beauty, no grace.\nTHE SOUL OF MAN LOVES PURITY...\nIf you reach to your innermost core you will suddenly find innocence arising in you, roses of innocence flowering.\n... BUT HIS MIND IS OFTEN REBELLIOUS.\nBut the mind is not willing just to be innocent. Innocence says yes, it is trust; the mind says no, it is doubt. The mind always lives through the no, it is negative; the soul is always positive. The soul has no idea of saying no, it knows nothing about the no; and the mind knows nothing about the yes. If the mind sometimes has to say yes, it only says it unwillingly. You can watch it in yourself: whenever your mind says yes it says it unwillingly because it cannot find any way of saying no, that’s why it says yes. Yes is not spontaneous for the mind; no is spontaneous.\nWatch the truth of this statement. These are not theories, hypotheses, these are simple facts. You can just watch it in yourself: the first thing that happens to your mind is no; it immediately says no – even if there is no reason to say no.\nJust the other day I received a letter from a sannyasin: “Osho, when you talked about Prem Chinmaya’s coming back, his dying from the sixth center and that he will have to live only one more life, I cannot believe you or trust you.”\nYou may not know anything about reincarnation; you can simply say, “I don’t know about it, so how can I believe or disbelieve?” You can remain open. But you will not miss any opportunity of saying no. Now, this sannyasin must be waiting for something to say no to. Do you know what it means to die from the sixth center? Have you any idea of the inner physiology of man?\nAsk Puja and Sheela what happened when Chinmaya died. They were surprised – they could not believe what was happening: his whole body became cool, his head became very hot. He complained also that something strange was happening “... as if my whole energy is coming into the head. My body is cool and calm, but my head is feeling almost as if it is on fire.”\nWhenever the soul leaves the body, the center that becomes its leaving center becomes hot – naturally, because the whole energy concentrates there. The energy that is spread all over the body gathers together at one point; that point certainly becomes absolute fire.\nYou don’t know anything about the inner physiology. If you don’t know, I am not telling you to believe in it – I am the last person to tell you to believe in anything – but there is no need to say no either; you can simply remain open, you can say, “I will see what happens when I die.”\nAnd then he says, “I don’t believe you, I don’t trust you. Does it matter?” To me it does not matter, not at all, because I don’t depend on your belief, but it matters immensely for you. I am not saying force yourself to say yes to me, because a forced yes will be only a disguised no, I am simply saying being here be open. There is no need to say yes or no, you can simply say, “I don’t know.” Function out of a state of not-knowing so that you remain available to experiment, to experience. If you say no you have become closed, and yes you can say only when you have experienced. So I am not asking you to believe in it, but I will certainly request you not to disbelieve. There is no need for belief and no need for disbelief. But this sannyasin’s mind must have been waiting for some opportunity.\nIt is very rare here because I don’t talk about things which you will find difficult to believe – I rarely talk about things which are beyond you. I leave them; I prepare you so that you can experience them one day. But once in a while something happens. For example, Prem Chinmaya’s death was such an occasion that I had to say something about death, something about which center he died from. I had to say this, that he will be back here soon. And these things are not beyond your comprehension if you are going deep into meditation, but if you are not going into deep meditation they are beyond comprehension.\nThe mind wants to say no and if you listen to the mind you stop listening to the Master. If you want to listen to the Master, first you have to be open so that one day yes can surface in you spontaneously. It matters much as far as you are concerned.\nBeing here and saying no in some way simply means you will be physically here and spiritually absent. It will be a sheer waste of your time; then there is no need to be here.\nThe whole effort of this Buddhafield, the whole purpose of it, is to help you to go beyond mind, to go beyond no.\nKo Hsuan’s sutra says:\nTHE SOUL OF MAN LOVES PURITY, BUT HIS MIND IS OFTEN REBELLIOUS. THE MIND OF MAN LOVES STILLNESS, BUT HIS DESIRES DRAW HIM INTO ACTIVITY.\nThe soul loves purity, innocence; that’s its natural joy. The mind is not interested in purity, in innocence, because innocence needs yes as a foundation and mind lives through no. But because the mind continuously says no it has to suffer much turmoil, hence there is a great need in the mind to be still, to be silent, to be calm and quiet.\nTHE MIND OF MAN LOVES STILLNESS...\nBut then there is another outer circle in your being – the circle of desires which don’t even allow you silence; they drag you into activity. The mind drags you into no’s, into negativity; that disturbs your purity. Yes is your innocence, no means you have lost your innocence. Then there are desires which don’t leave you at the mind, they want some activity; just no won’t do. They drag you into\na thousand and one activities – the Chinese expression is into “ten thousand things”; they keep you constantly occupied – money, power, prestige; they go on goading you, “Do this. Achieve this. Without achieving this you are not a real man. Prove that you are powerful, prove that you are great, prove that you are special.” And to prove it you have to move almost into a state of insanity. That’s what politics is.\nPolitics is the other pole, exactly the opposite pole to religion. Religion takes you to the essence of your being and politics takes you to the accidents of your desires. The desires keep you so occupied with the mundane, with the futile, that you start forgetting everything that is intrinsic, that is really valuable. Running after money, you forget all about the inner treasure. Running after power, you forget all about the power of Tao, which is the supreme power. Running after name and fame, you forget completely that name and fame are just momentary. But they go on goading you; they won’t leave you for a single moment. In the night you will dream about desires, in the day you will run after desires. And all desires are mirages, like the horizon that looks so close that if you just go, within an hour you will be able to reach it. But you never reach it because it does not really exist.\nYou go on forgetting everything: you forget the soul, the heaven; you even forget the body, the earth. You become almost mad. All your politicians are mad. All your people who are running after money are mad, who are running after fame are mad. But because they are in the majority, they appear to be absolutely right. In fact, the person who is not interested in name and fame, power and prestige seems to be a little out of his senses. What has happened to this man?\nYou will be asked again and again, “What has happened to you? Why are you not interested in accumulating more money? What do you do just by sitting silently looking inwards?” You will be condemned by the world because the world consists of extroverts. They will call you introverts, they will tell you that introversion is a kind of perversion, they will tell you that you are selfish, that you are narcissistic, that you are only interested in your own joy, that you should be concerned with others, that you should live like everybody else, that you should be part of the crowd. Of course, they are many and you will be very alone.\nJesus has said to his disciples, “I am sending you amongst wolves.” And I know what he means. When I send you into the world I also know I am sending you amongst wolves. You are trying to be silent, innocent, childlike, and the world is trying to achieve just the opposite ends.\nWHEN A MAN IS CONSTANTLY ABLE TO GOVERN HIS DESIRES, HIS MIND BECOMES SPONTANEOUSLY STILL.\nAgain wrong words have been used.\nWHEN A MAN IS CONSTANTLY ABLE TO GOVERN HIS DESIRES...\nNo, Ko Hsuan cannot say “to govern his desires” because that means repression, that means control. He can only say:\nWHEN A MAN IS CONSTANTLY ABLE TO understand HIS DESIRES, HIS MIND BECOMES SPONTANEOUSLY STILL.\nOnly understanding is needed; nothing else ever helps. If you understand a desire it disappears. Desires are like darkness: you bring light and darkness disappears. You need not throw it out, you need not repress it, you need not close doors to keep it out – you cannot do anything directly with darkness – you just have to bring light in. A small candle will do, and all darkness disappears. Just a little light of understanding and desires start disappearing. Then arises spontaneous stillness.\nRemember this word “spontaneous”; that is the key word as far as Tao is concerned. WHEN THE MIND IS UNCLOUDED, THE SOUL IS SEEN TO BE PURE.\nAnd when there are no desires, thoughts automatically disappear, because thoughts are servants of desires. When there are desires, your mind is full of thoughts, full of plans – what to do, how to do, how to fulfill these desires. When desires disappear you have cut the tree from the very root. Then leaves start disappearing, branches disappear, the tree itself disappears of its own accord, and the mind is unclouded. In that unclouded state of mind, in that thoughtless state of mind you will be able to see the purity of your inner being.\nTHEN, WITH CERTAINTY THE SIX DESIRES WILL CEASE TO BE BEGOTTEN AND THE THREE POISONS WILL BE ELIMINATED AND DISSOLVED.\nThis is something very significant to remember.\nAll the religions have talked only about five senses it is only Tao that talks about six senses. All the religions have talked about five desires because man consists of five senses; Tao talks about six desires. The insight is tremendous because just recently, just in this century, science has discovered the sixth sense; otherwise the sixth sense was not known. Your ear has two senses; your ear is not a single sense – hidden inside it is another sense: the sense that keeps your body balanced.\nThat’s why when you see a drunkard walking you can see that he cannot walk straight; zigzag he goes. His steps are not in harmony for the simple reason that alcohol affects the sixth sense, that which keeps your body balanced. It has been a Taoist insight for five thousand years that there are six senses. Through the eye the desire for beauty arises, through the ear the desire for music arises, from the nose the desire for nice smells arises, from the tongue the desire for taste, and from the whole skin the desire to touch – these are the five traditional senses – and from the sixth sense the desire to remain in control, balanced. If somebody hits your ear hard you will lose balance; you will see stars in the day.\nThese six desires no longer arise. Not that the eyes go blind; in fact, now they can see beauty more truly, but there is no desire to possess beauty. Not that you become deaf to music, but now there is no desire to possess anything. You enjoy more because your energy is free and your senses are more clear, more transparent.\nNobody can see beauty more clearly than a Buddha, nobody can hear music more deeply than a Lao Tzu, nobody can taste better than Jesus. All their senses become truly sensitive, they are real senses. Your senses are dull. Your society helps you to keep them dull because the society is afraid: if your senses are really very keen and very sensitive then you can be a dangerous person because of your desire to possess. You see a beautiful woman: she is somebody else’s wife, and if your eyes\nare really able to see the beauty and you have the desire to possess also then you will grab the woman, you will escape with the woman, you will rape the woman. Something criminal is bound to happen.\nNature allows you total sensitivity only when you become capable of dropping all possessiveness, all idea of possessing. Then you can touch, and then even rocks feel velvety. Then everything starts having a divine quality, everything is transformed.\n... AND THE THREE POISONS WILL BE ELIMINATED AND DISSOLVED.\nWhat are the three poisons? The first is sexuality – not sex, remember, but sexuality. Sex is natural. Tao is not against sex, it is the only religious approach which is in total agreement with sex. Tao has its own science of sex, it has its own Tantra, which really goes far deeper than Indian Tantra. But sexuality is a totally different phenomenon; sexuality means a perverted state of sex energy. Then it becomes poisonous.\nThe second poison is anger and the third poison is greed. Sexuality, anger, greed: these three poisons combined together, this unholy trinity, creates your ego. And all these three can be dissolved, eliminated. If sexuality disappears you will be surprised that anger disappears – without any effort on your part. Anger simply means that your sexuality is hindered. Anybody who hinders your sexuality creates anger in you; he is your enemy. And sexuality creates greed; greed is a form of sexuality, it is a perverted form. Money becomes your object of love because the society does not allow any other kind of love. It allows money, power; they can become your objects of love. It helps to change your object of love. First it changes your sex into sexuality...\nSee the difference. Sex is a natural phenomenon; it is your capacity to reproduce. Sexuality means your mind is continuously occupied by sex; it is no more a natural phenomenon, it has become cerebral. It is no more confined to the sex center, it has gone to the head. Now you are constantly thinking.\nJust watch for one hour how many times you think of sex – you will be surprised. Psychologists say that you are in for a great surprise if you watch your mind to see how many times in an hour you think about sex. Men think about it twice as much as women do; that may be one of the causes of conflict between them. They have a different kind of sexuality. Man’s sexuality is more repressed than woman’s for the simple reason that man has to earn money, has to become famous, has to be a prime minister or a politician. Naturally, from where is he going to get all this energy to be the president? There is only one energy; you don’t have many energies in you, mind you, you have only one kind of energy. Whatsoever name you want to give to it you can give, “xyz”, but you have only one kind of energy. Sigmund Freud has called it libido, but it simply means sex. Now if you want to have more money or more power, you want to be the president of the country or the prime minister of the country, then you have to take your sexuality and channelize it.\nI have heard:\nOne day Carter and Brezhnev met for a long meeting. The two wives waited outside the meeting room for so many hours, they eventually struck up a conversation. Soon they were finding they liked each other and were sharing intimacies.\nRosalyn Carter confessed, “You won’t believe this, my dear Brezhnova, but Jimmy just isn’t the same man I married. For such a long time now he hasn’t even looked at me. He comes home so tired he immediately goes to bed and falls asleep.”\n“With me it is the same,” said Brezhnova. “I just don’t know what to do.”\n“The other night,” explained Rosalyn Carter, “I finally decided to tempt Jimmy. I put on my transparent black negligee and some expensive perfume, turned down the lights, put some sexy French music on the stereo and piled pillows on the bed. And then I waited for him in the bedroom.\n“He came into the bedroom already talking about all the problems in the Middle East, the dollar going down, etcetera, etcetera, and I threw him down on the pile of pillows, took off his shirt, opened up my negligee to show him my bare breasts and asked him, ‘Jimmy, does this remind you of anything?’\n“He looked at my tits, put his hand to his forehead and said, ‘Of course... I must call Moshe Dayan!’”\n“That’s nothing,” said Brezhnova. “With me it was worse. I did everything you did, except I didn’t bother with the negligee. As soon as he lay down on the bed I jumped on him and put my cunt right in front of his face and said, ‘Look at this, Brezy... does it remind you of something?’ And he replied, ‘Oh yes! I forgot to call Fidel Castro!’”\nIt is bound to happen. You have to divert your sexual energy; then money, power, prestige, they become your sexual objects. And these people can talk about morality and discipline easily; they can teach others how to control their sexuality very easily, but in fact what they are doing is nothing but a perversion of sex. And these people become very violent; they are violent – they keep the whole world always on the brink of war.\nWhen sex becomes perverted, love becomes hatred. Nothing is wrong with sex, but everything is wrong with sexuality. Sex should be allowed a natural flow. Yes, one day, if you live it naturally, transcendence happens; but it is spontaneous, it is not celibacy. It comes through celebration.\nJust as at the age of fourteen you become mature sexually, at the age of forty-two, if you have lived your sex naturally, you will go beyond it. But it is a strange world. Children become sexual, children who are not sexually mature, because the whole atmosphere is poisoned. Small children start thinking of sex. Seeing films, reading novels, looking at obscene magazines, they start thinking about sex.\nItalian Piero comes to a village. He asks a farmer, “Do you know where little children come-a from?” “They grow out of cabbages!” the farmer answers.\nPiero walks a little further and meets the milkman. “Hey!” says Piero. “Do ya know where little children come-a from!”\n“Sure,” answers the milkman, “the stork brings them.”\nPiero continues on his way a little despondent, then...”Ah!” he thinks, “here comes-a the right-a man to ask-a! Vicar! Do ya know where little children come-a from?”\n“Yes, my son,” responds the Vicar. “God sends them from heaven.”\n“Shit-a!’ exclaims Piero.”Isn’t there anyone in this-a village who fucks-a?”\nChildren become sexual before their time, and then you will find eighty year-old men running after women. Both are in an unnatural state.\nTao believes in total naturalness. It is not against sex, it is against sexuality, because it knows that if sexuality does not enter in your life – that means if perversion does not enter in your life – if nobody teaches you to be against sex there will be no perversion. It is because of your saints and moralists and puritans that you all have become perverted – children and old men, all. If sex is left alone without interference from any moral teaching, then one day the child will become sexually mature nearabout fourteen, and one day nearabout forty-two he will transcend it. He will have seen by that time that it is child’s play and enough is enough. And that transcendence is beautiful. Anything that happens on its own is beautiful because it comes through Tao. And then anger will not be there in your mind, neither will greed.\nTHE REASON MEN DO NOT POSSESS THE ABILITY TO ACHIEVE THIS IS BECAUSE THEIR MINDS ARE NOT CLEAR AND THEIR DESIRES ARE UNRESTRAINED.\nMeditation brings both clarity and a certain inner discipline. And by “meditation” Tao simply means watching your mind and its functions.\nHE WHO HAS THE POWER TO TRANSCEND HIS DESIRES, LOOKING WITHIN AND CONTEMPLATING MIND...\nThat is the definition of meditation according to Ko Hsuan:\n... LOOKING WITHIN AND CONTEMPLATING MIND...\nJust silently watching all the processes of the mind – thoughts, memories, imagination, dreams, desires – a realization happens, a realization that:\n... IN HIS MIND, MIND IS NOT...\nThis sutra is immensely significant. When you watch the mind clearly, silently, the mind starts disappearing. More watchfulness, less mind. One percent watchfulness, ninety-nine percent mind. Ninety-nine percent watchfulness, one percent mind. One hundred percent watchfulness and there is no mind in the mind. All thoughts have gone, the mind is absolutely empty. And in that emptiness Tao comes in, rushes in. You have created the right space for it.\n... LOOKING WITHOUT AND CONTEMPLATING FORM...\nThen you are capable of looking without. First look within, let the mind disappear, attain to clarity, then look without.\n... LOOKING WITHOUT AND CONTEMPLATING FORM...\nThen meditate on the forms outside: the trees, the clouds, the stars, the moon...\n... BE REALIZES THAT IN FORM, FORM IS NOT...\nThen you will be surprised to see that the waves are not there, only the ocean. In the form there is no form. The trees are not there but only life expressing itself in millions of forms but not confined to any form; it is formless.\n... LOOKING AT THINGS STILL MORE REMOTE AND CONTEMPLATING MATTER, HE REALIZES THAT IN MATTER, MATTER IS NOT.\nThat too is of great significance. It is only now that modern physicists have said that matter does not exist, but Tao has been saying for five thousand years that:\n... IN MATTER, MATTER IS NOT.\nIf you can meditate, start from within, then look around and then look into things at their deepest core. First mind disappears, then form disappears, then matter disappears. Then what is left? That which is left is Tao, is nature. And to live in that nature is to live in freedom, is to live in eternal bliss.\n“Tao” is the word of Ko Hsuan for God. “Dhamma” is the word of Buddha for Tao. Buddha says: AIS DHAMMO SANANTANO – this IS the eternal law. Once you have seen the eternal law you become part of eternity. Time is transcended, space is transcended. You are no more and for the first time you are. You are no more as a separate entity, but for the first time you are the whole.\nThis is my vision too. My agreement with Tao is absolute. I cannot say that about other religions; with Tao I can say it without any hesitation. Tao is the most profound insight that has ever been achieved on the earth.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"9167","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/tao_the_golden_gate_vol_1/part9/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/tao_the_golden_gate_vol_1/>Tao.

IN PURITY AND STILLNESS, HEAVEN AND EARTH ARE UNITED IN HIM.</p><p><br></p><p>THE SOUL OF MAN LOVES PURITY, BUT HIS MIND IS OFTEN REBELLIOUS. THE
MIND OF MAN LOVES STILLNESS, BUT HIS DESIRES DRAW HIM INTO ACTIVITY.
WHEN A MAN IS CONSTANTLY ABLE TO GOVERN HIS DESIRES, HIS MIND BECOMES
SPONTANEOUSLY STILL. WHEN THE MIND IS UNCLOUDED, THE SOUL IS SEEN TO BE
PURE. THEN, WITH CERTAINTY THE SIX DESIRES WILL CEASE TO BE BEGOTTEN AND

LOOKING AT THINGS STILL MORE REMOTE AND CONTEMPLATING MATTER, HE
REALIZES THAT IN MATTER, MATTER IS NOT.</p><p><br></p><p>Tao believes in spontaneity – not in cultivating virtues, not in
creating a character, not even in conscience, they are all ego efforts,
and ego is against Tao. Tao is a state of let-go: to be in</p><p>tune with existence with such totality that there is no separation at
all. You are not even the part, you are the whole. You are not the wave
but the ocean itself. Hence there is no question of doing. Tao means
being.</p><p><br></p><p>All other so-called religions insist on doing. They believe in
commandments: “Do this, don’t do that.” They have many shoulds and
should nots. The Buddhist scriptures have thirty-three thousand rules
for a monk; even to remember them is impossible. People forget even what
the Ten Commandments are – how can they remember thirty-three thousand
rules? Their whole life will be wasted only in remembering them. When
are they going to cultivate these rules? It will take millions of
lives.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe because of this the idea of many many lives became so
significant in the East, because time is needed to cultivate. One life
is not enough – even a thousand lives will not be enough – you need
millions of lives to cultivate all this. In fact, the whole approach
helps you to go on postponing. The tomorrow becomes bigger and bigger,
almost infinite, and the today is so small that you can deceive
yourself, you can say to yourself, “Let me remain whatsoever I am today;
tomorrow I will change. And today, anyway, is so small, nothing much is
possible. I will start tomorrow.” Of course the tomorrow never comes; it
is there only in the imagination.</p><p><br></p><p>Tao believes in this moment; Tao has no idea of future. If you can
live this moment in purity, in silence, in spontaneity, then your life
is transformed. Not that you transform it: Tao transforms it, the whole
transforms it. You simply allow the river to take you to the ocean; you
need not push the river.</p><p><br></p><p>But when such great truths are put into language, difficulties arise
because our language is made by us. It is not made by people like Lao
Tzu, Chuang Tzu, Lieh Tzu, Ko Hsuan, it is made by the mediocre people
the world is full of. Obviously, language is their invention and it
carries their meanings, their attitudes towards life. So whatsoever you
say is going to be somewhere inadequate – not only inadequate but deep
down wrong also.</p><p><br></p><p>This has to be remembered, and even more so about these sutras
because these sutras were written originally in Chinese. Chinese is a
language totally different from any other language, it is the most
difficult language in the world for the simple reason that it has no
alphabet, it is a pictorial language. Pictorial languages are the most
ancient languages; they must have come from the very dawn of human
consciousness, because when man is a child he thinks in pictures, he
cannot think in words, so his language is pictorial. That’s why in
children’s books there are so many colored pictures; the text is not
much but pictures are many. The child is not interested in the text, he
is interested in the pictures. Looking at the picture of the mango, a
very juicy colorful mango, he may become interested to know what it is
called, how it is written, and he may read the text – only a few words
about the mango. Slowly slowly the mango disappears, giving place to
language. In the university books pictures disappear completely. The
more scholarly a book is, the less is the possibility of pictures; all
is language. In your sleep you still dream not in a linguistic way but
in a pictorial way because in your sleep you again become a child.</p><p><br></p><p>Chinese is a dream language – and we know the difficulty with the
dreams. You have dreamed something, but in the morning you cannot figure
out what it means. You will need an expert to interpret it, and even
experts won’t agree. The Freudian will say one thing, the Jungian will
say something else, the Adlerian may say just the opposite. And now
there are many more new trends, new schools of psychoanalysis, and they
all have their interpretations. And whomsoever you are</p><p>reading will look valid, reasonable, because they can all provide
great rationalizations The dream is yours, but you don’t know what it
means because a dream can mean many things; a dream is
multi-dimensional.</p><p><br></p><p>And that’s the difficulty with the Chinese language: it is a dream
language, a pictorial language – each picture can mean many things.
Hence there are translations of Chinese scriptures, many translations,
and no two translations ever agree, because a picture can be interpreted
in as many ways as there are people to interpret it. The Chinese
language is only symbolic; it indicates. It is very poetic, it is not
like arithmetic.</p><p><br></p><p>If you remember this, only then will you not fall into the trap in
which almost all the scholars have fallen.</p><p><br></p><p>These sutras were not written in an alphabetical language so
whatsoever is being said in these sutras is an interpretation. And I
myself don’t agree in many places; if I were to translate it it would be
a totally different translation. I will tell you where I differ and
why</p><p><br></p><p>THE VENERABLE MASTER SAID:</p><p><br></p><p>WHEN MAN ATTAINS THE POWER TO TRANSCEND THAT WHICH CHANGES... HEAVEN
AND EARTH ARE UNITED IN HIM.</p><p><br></p><p>The first thing that’s absolutely wrong is the idea of attainment.
Tao does not believe that you have to attain anything or that you CAN
attain anything. You are already that which you can be: nothing more can
be attained. The very idea of attainment, of achievement is alien to the
Taoist approach. There is nothing to attain, nothing to achieve. The
idea of attainment and achievement is rooted in our egos. The ego is
always ambitious; it can’t be otherwise. Either it has to attain worldly
things or it has to attain other-worldly powers, SIDDHIS, but something
has to be attained. The ego lives by attaining.</p><p><br></p><p>And Tao says the ego has to be dissolved, you cannot be allowed to be
ambitious – to be ambitious is to go against Tao. Tao teaches
non-ambitiousness. You have just to be yourself as you are. You are
already perfect; you have never left your perfection for a single
moment. You are already in Tao; it is just that you have started
dreaming that you have lost it, that you have gone far away.</p><p><br></p><p>It is just like as in your sleep you remain in your room, in your
bed, but you can dream of faraway places. You can visit the moon and
Mars, you can go to the stars, but in the morning you will find you have
not left your bed, not even for a single moment.</p><p><br></p><p>When one becomes conscious one becomes aware of the whole
ridiculousness of all the achievements and failures. It is the idea of
achievement that brings failure, frustration in its wake. If you succeed
it brings ego. Ego is misery because the more ego you have the more you
think that you are separate from the whole, that you have become
somebody special, unique, superior, higher, holier, that you don’t
belong to the ordinary world, that you are a saint, a mahatma. If you
fail, then there is frustration; that brings pain, that brings anguish.
Whatsoever happens, success or failure, you will suffer. Ego brings
suffering; whether it succeeds or fails makes no difference. Hence with
the Taoist approach this idea of attainment is totally wrong – remember
it.</p><p>The translator says:</p><p><br></p><p>WHEN MAN ATTAINS THE POWER...</p><p><br></p><p>Again the word “power” is not right because Tao does not believe in
power. It believes, really, in utter powerlessness, because when you are
powerful you are fighting against the whole. Adolf Hitler is powerful,
Alexander the Great is powerful, Ivan the Terrible is powerful; Genghis
Khan, Tamburlaine, these are powerful people, but they are fighting
against nature, spontaneity.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus is not powerful, Jesus is utterly powerless. When Jesus was
crucified his disciples were waiting: “Now is the time he will show his
power.” The enemies were waiting, the friends were waiting for the same
thing: “Now he is going to show his miraculous power, now he will prove
that he is the only begotten son of God.” He didn’t prove anything, he
simply died. He died like any mortal – he died like the two thieves who
were crucified with him. He was just in the middle; on either side of
him there was a thief. The enemies were frustrated, the friends were
frustrated even more. What happened? Where had his power gone? And he
was always talking about being the son of God... But to be the son of
God simply means to be utterly powerless.</p><p><br></p><p>How we go on misunderstanding people like Jesus, Lao Tzu, Ko Hsuan!
Our misunderstanding is almost infinite. He surrendered to God. Yes, for
a moment he himself had become aware of all the expectations. Almost
one-hundred thousand people had gathered to see; friends were very few.
He must have seen the expectation in people’s eyes – they were expecting
miracles. Great things were going to happen – something that only
happens once in thousands of years. For a moment he may have been
impressed, hypnotized by so much attention, by so much expectation. The
whole atmosphere must have been charged with only one desire: to see his
power.</p><p><br></p><p>And he asked God, “Have you forsaken me?” But then immediately he
understood – he was a man of intelligence, tremendous intelligence.
Immediately he understood that whatsoever he has said is wrong. How can
God forsake him? The very idea that God can forsake him is negative, is
ugly; it is not trust.</p><p><br></p><p>If God shows miracles, then it is very easy to trust. If he is
proving your power then it is very easy to trust; anybody will be able
to trust. No intelligence is needed to trust, no special understanding
is needed to trust; any fool would have trusted.</p><p><br></p><p>But nothing was happening and the last moment has arrived. Jesus
immediately understood the point – this is the time to understand. He
surrendered. He said: Thy kingdom come, thy will be done. Don’t listen
to me, you simply go on doing whatsoever you want to do. Who am I to
suggest? I am no more, I am in your hands.</p><p><br></p><p>This was real powerlessness. This is Tao. Ko Hsuan would have
understood it; the Jews could not understand it. And the whole gathering
was of Jews, friends or enemies. And they had always believed in
achievement, in power, in ambition – all their prophets had been doing
miracles. If they were angry with Jesus the reason was that he was not
coming up to the mark: he was not proving himself to be really a
prophet, because the ancient prophets had done so many miracles.</p><p><br></p><p>And my feeling is that he never did any miracles. If he had done any
miracles, all the Jews would have converted; they would not have
crucified him. It is enough proof that he never did any miracles.</p><p>And all the miracles that are propounded by the Christians are
invented. These Christians are also of the same mind, the same desire,
the same ambition: “How can Our Lord be without miracles? If ordinary
prophets were doing so many things, how can Our Lord be without
miracles?” So they have invented even better miracles, greater miracles
than those of all the prophets.</p><p><br></p><p>But my feeling is that Jesus was a man of Tao. He was really a man
who can be called religious.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard a beautiful story. It is not recorded anywhere. It must
have gone from one Master to another, just by word of mouth: that Moses,
Abraham, Ezekiel, three ancient prophets, were sitting under a tree in
heaven talking about great things, talking about the Old Testament. Then
suddenly Abraham said, “We know everything about the Old Testament. Had
Jesus been here he would have told us something about the New
Testament.”</p><p><br></p><p>Moses laughed and he called a boy who was sitting just by the side of
the tree and said, “Jesus, please go and bring three cups of coffee for
us.”</p><p><br></p><p>Abraham was shocked. This is Jesus? And Jesus went to bring three
cups of coffee for the old prophets.</p><p><br></p><p>But I love this story. Only Jesus can do that – so utterly powerless.
His powerlessness is his miracle: he has annihilated himself totally.
They were not even aware of his presence, that he is sitting by the side
of the tree. He didn’t say a single word: that “I am Jesus Christ, the
only begotten son of God. And what are you saying? I should go and bring
three cups of coffee for you? You go yourself! Is this the way to talk
to the son of God?” But he simply went.</p><p><br></p><p>Only Jesus can do it, or Lao Tzu or Ko Hsuan or Bodhidharma or Basho.
These are people who have dropped the whole power trip, the whole
number.</p><p><br></p><p>Ko Hsuan cannot mean what the translation will create in your mind.
It says: WHEN MAN ATTAINS THE POWER TO TRANSCEND THAT WHICH
CHANGES...</p><p>No. If I were to translate it... I don’t know Chinese at all, but who
cares? I can still translate, not knowing a single word of Chinese,
because I know the spirit of Tao; that’s my experience. If I were to
translate it, I would say;</p><p><br></p><p>WHEN MAN SURRENDERS TO THE POWER OF TAO, HE TRANSCENDS THAT WHICH
CHANGES.</p><p><br></p><p>When man becomes utterly powerless as a separate entity, then he
transcends that which changes. Then he abides in purity and stillness.
Then the purity that comes to him is not something cultivated from the
outside .</p><p><br></p><p>It is not something that you have to maintain continuously, that you
have to guard because otherwise yOu will lose it... Your saints are
continuously on guard. They know perfectly well that even if they are
relaxed for a single moment they will lose all their purity. They don’t
abide in it, it is not natural to them, it is something artificial,
arbitrary; they have imposed it on themselves.</p><p>You don’t need to BREATHE, YOU need not remember to breathe;
otherwise you would have been dead long before now, because any time you
forget about breathing – a beautiful woman passes by and you forget
about breathing – and finished! There is the full point. Then you cannot
breathe again. But breathing continues even while you are asleep – not
only while you are deeply asleep, even if you are in a coma breathing
continues; it does not depend on you.</p><p><br></p><p>Once I went to see a woman... Her husband loved me very much. He came
crying and weeping and he said, “This was my wife’s last wish, that she
wanted to see you. But for nine months she has been in a coma and the
doctors say there is no possibility that she will ever become conscious.
But please come with me just to fulfill her last desire. That was her
last desire before she became unconscious.”</p><p><br></p><p>So I went to see the woman. For nine months she had been in a coma,
but she was breathing perfectly. To be in a coma means to be almost
dead. And she died after three months; after remaining one year in a
coma she died. But for one year she continued to breathe; her breathing
was perfect, there was no disturbance in it.</p><p><br></p><p>Tao takes care of your breathing; it is natural. Your blood
circulates continuously, day in, day out, year in, year out. For
centuries man used to think that there was no circulation of the blood
in the body; blood simply filled the body as water filled a pot. It is
only three hundred years ago that it was discovered that blood did not
just fill the body; it continuously circulates, it goes on circulating
at a very great speed. That keeps your inner world alive, dynamic. Who
is circulating your blood? – certainly not you, otherwise you might
forget it. Who digests your food? – certainly not you. In fact, if you
become very conscious of digestion you will disturb your stomach.</p><p><br></p><p>Try a simple experiment for twenty-four hours: when you are eating
just become conscious that the food is going into the stomach; now you
have to digest it. And troubles will start: you will feel heavy and you
will not know what to do, how to digest it. Just remain conscious that
the food is in the stomach and it has to be digested, and you are almost
incapable of doing anything. Do a few yoga exercises, stand on your
head, jog, jump, and within twenty-four hours you will have a bad
stomach; you will have disturbed the whole process. It does not need you
at all. Once the food has gone below your throat you need not bother
about it; Tao takes care of it.</p><p><br></p><p>All that is essential is natural, and to live your whole life in a
natural way is the only teaching of Tao. It teaches you powerlessness,
but there is great power in powerlessness – the power of God, the power
of the whole, not your power, not my power, not anybody’s power.</p><p><br></p><p>Then there arises a purity in you. You are not the author of it, you
are not the architect of it; you are simply a witness, a watcher. And
there arises a tremendous stillness, not something forced from the
outside. That’s what your so-called religious people are doing all over
the world: they are forcing purity. And whenever you force purity on
yourself, whenever it becomes a cultivated phenomenon, it is repression
and nothing else. And repression only creates ugliness; it creates a
split in you, it makes you schizophrenic.</p><p><br></p><p>One priest invites another priest to lunch at his house. At the end
of the meal, the guest, who is slightly drunk, notices how pretty the
maid is.</p><p>He turns to his colleague and says, “You are an old friend, you can
tell me – do you sleep with the girl?”</p><p><br></p><p>The host is very angry. “How dare you speak like this in my house?”
he cries. “Please leave immediately!”</p><p><br></p><p>After his friend has gone, the priest notices that a beautiful silver
spoon has disappeared, so the following morning he sends his friend a
note saying, “My dear holy friend, I am not saying that you are a thief,
but if you find my silver spoon, please send it back!”</p><p><br></p><p>The answer comes quickly:</p><p><br></p><p>“My dear holy friend, I am not saying that you are a liar, but if you
had slept in your own bed last night, you would have found your silver
spoon!”</p><p><br></p><p>All cultivated purity creates hypocrisy, it creates a duality in you.
It is bound to create it because you have not understood; you have
simply denied something. It has not disappeared; it is there waiting to
take revenge. And it will find its own way – it will come from the back
door. If you don’t allow it to come from the front door it will come
from the back door.</p><p><br></p><p>Tao does not believe in any cultivated character; it believes in a
natural purity, in a natural stillness. You must have watched how if you
try to become silent then each and every thing becomes a disturbance, a
distraction. Just a dog barking, who is not at all aware that you are
trying to meditate, who has nothing against meditation, who is not an
old enemy, who is not taking any revenge on you for some past karma...
He is enjoying his barking; that is his meditation. Maybe he is doing
Dynamic Meditation! He seems to be more modern and up to date than you –
you are doing vipassana and he is doing Dynamic! But you will be
disturbed. He is not disturbed by your vipassana and you are disturbed
by his Dynamic Meditation for the simple reason that you are forcing
something; it is not natural. It is just a very thin layer of stillness
that somehow you have painted upon yourself. Deep down a thousand and
one dogs are barking, and they immediately understand the dog barking
and they start feeling a great urge to bark. The distraction comes from
your inner dogs, it is not coming from the outer dog; the outer dog is
not responsible at all. If your silence is natural, the dog’s barking
will not be a distraction; it may even enhance your stillness, it may
become a background to your stillness. That’s how it happens.</p><p><br></p><p>When in the night you see the stars, beautiful stars have you ever
thought what happens to these stars in the day? They don’t go away –
where can they go? They are there, but because the background is no more
there, the darkness is no more there, you cannot see them. In the night
the darkness functions as a background: the darker the night, the more
shining are the stars. They are not so shining on a full-moon night, but
when there is no moon at all the stars are really beautiful.</p><p><br></p><p>The same is true about a real silence: everything that ordinarily
proves a distraction becomes a background. The dog barking, the traffic
noise somebody shouting, children crying, running, the wife cooking food
in the kitchen – everything becomes a background and everything deepens
your silence because you are not concentrating, you are not forcing
anything; you are simply relaxed. Things go on happening, you remain
untouched; you remain absolutely centered, and effortlessly
centered.</p><p>This thing has to be remembered: Tao teaches you effortless
naturalness; it does not believe in effort as Yoga does. Yoga and Tao
are totally opposite to each other. That’s why Yoga could not penetrate
China. Buddha impressed China for the simple reason that he also says
that you should be natural, that your meditation should be effortless,
that it should not be imposed from the outside, that it should arise
from your innermost core. It should not be a plastic flower, it should
be a real rose.</p><p><br></p><p>WHEN MAN ATTAINS THE POWER TO TRANSCEND THAT WHICH CHANGES, ABIDING,
IN PURITY AND STILLNESS, HEAVEN AND EARTH ARE UNITED IN HIM.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what I call the meeting of the East and the West, the meeting
of materialism and spiritualism. That’s my idea of Zorba the Buddha:
HEAVEN AND EARTH ARE UNITED IN HIM.</p><p><br></p><p>Tao is not other-worldly like Jainism; it is not this-worldly either
like Charvakas. It believes in the unity of existence; it does not
divide existence in any way. Its whole vision is that of total unity,
organic unity.</p><p><br></p><p>Heaven and earth are one; in you they are already meeting. Your body
is part of the earth, your soul is part of heaven. The meeting is
already happening – you are not aware of it. If you relax you will
become aware of it, and the meeting is tremendously beautiful. Earth
alone is dead. That’s why a materialist philosophy of life sooner or
later comes to realize that life is meaningless.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what has happened in the West. All great thinkers of this
century in the West are obsessed only with one problem: the meaning of
life. And they all agree on one point at least: that life is
meaningless.</p><p><br></p><p>In Dostoevsky’s famous novel, one of the most important novels ever
written... If I am asked to name the ten best novels in the world, then
this will be one of those ten – not only one of them but the first of
those ten: THE BROTHERS KARAMAZOV. It is one of the greatest
creations.</p><p><br></p><p>In THE BROTHERS KARAMAZOV one of the characters says to God, “Where
are you? I want to meet you – not that I am interested in seeing you,
not that I want to know about you; I simply want to give you back the
ticket that you gave me to enter into this world. Please take it back!
This whole world is absolutely meaningless.”</p><p><br></p><p>Marcel says in one of his writings that suicide seems to be the most
important metaphysical problem. If life is meaningless then of course
suicide seems to be the most important metaphysical problem. Why go on
living? In the past people used to think that it was only cowards who
commit suicide; now the pendulum seems to have moved to the other
extreme. The materialists are feeling so meaningless that the idea is
arising slowly and gathering force that it is only cowards who go on
living; it is the brave people who try to commit suicide. Why go on
living if there is no meaning?</p><p><br></p><p>But this has happened because only earth was accepted, not the sky,
not heaven. Earth is meaningless, barren; without the sky there is no
soul – you are just a body, a corpse. And what meaning can a corpse
have? When the soul leaves the body, meaning has left the body. And if
you don’t believe in the soul then you are bound to feel sooner or later
that life has no meaning. The West is feeling this great
meaninglessness.</p><p>And the East believed only in heaven, only in the soul, but that is
an abstraction. The body is concrete, the soul is only an abstraction;
it is intangible. And when you start running after intangibles, after
invisibles, you lose track of all that is concrete. That’s why the East
is poor, starving, ill, burdened with thousands of problems and seems to
have no way of solving them for the simple reason that for centuries we
have never bothered about the earth; our eyes were fixed on the sky.</p><p><br></p><p>An ancient Greek parable says:</p><p><br></p><p>One very famous astrologer was looking at the sky in the night,
watching the stars, studying the stars. He lost his way, naturally,
because he was not looking at the earth where he was walking, and he
fell in a well. Then he became aware, but then it was too late. He
started shouting,“Save me!” He was outside the village.</p><p><br></p><p>An old woman who lived nearby somehow managed to save him. When he
came out he told the woman, “You may not know me, you may not recognize
me in this dark night, but I will tell you who I am: I am the king’s
special astrologer! It is very difficult for people even to approach me,
but you can come to me. I will tell you about your future.”</p><p><br></p><p>The old woman laughed. She said, “You fool! You don’t know even where
is the well and where is the road, and you will tell me about my
future!”</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what has happened in the East: the East has fallen into the
well, lost track of the concrete, become too metaphysical.</p><p><br></p><p>Tao seems to be the only life vision which is total. It does not deny
the earth, it does not deny the sky. It accepts both, it accepts the
unity of both. It says: The man who has come to know spontaneous purity
and stillness, who has become relaxed with the whole, with the law of
the ultimate – in him heaven and earth are united.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s my concept of a sannyasin too. In you I would like this
meeting to happen. You will be misunderstood all over the world: in the
East people will think you are materialist, in the West people will
think you have become metaphysical. That means you have gone crazy,
berserk, that you are talking mumbo-jumbo. They will say, “Stop all this
nonsense! Be realistic, Be pragmatic.” You will be misunderstood
everywhere because the East has believed only in half and the West has
believed in half.</p><p><br></p><p>I believe in the whole. To me to trust the whole is the only way to
be holy, and to trust the whole is the only way to be whole. And when
you are whole, life is bliss, life is benediction, life is a
celebration.</p><p><br></p><p>THE SOUL OF MAN LOVES PURITY... BUT HIS DESIRES DRAW HIM INTO
ACTIVITY,</p><p><br></p><p>Man has three layers; those three layers have to be understood. The
first, the deepest core, is the soul; the soul means your center of
being. And the outermost circumference consists of desires. And between
the two is another concentric circle, half way from both, from the outer
and from the inner. It is neither outer nor inner – that is your
mind.</p><p><br></p><p>THE SOUL OF MAN LOVES PURITY . .</p><p>By purity Ko Hsuan always means innocence, so don’t misunderstand it
with any moralistic meaning of purity because Tao does not believe in
any morality or any immorality: only innocence. That’s why the child is
innocent, because when he is born he is just the intrinsic center; the
two circles have not yet gathered around the center. That’s why every
child looks so beautiful. Have you ever come across an ugly child? It is
impossible. And what happens to all the beautiful children? – because if
all children are beautiful then all people should be beautiful because
these same children become grown up people. But somewhere on the way
they all disappear; something ugly sets in. We give them wrong
circumferences; we give them wrong minds, wrong desires. We create such
a dichotomy in their being that they become a crowd, not a unity. They
are no more integrated beings; they become fragments. And to be
fragmentary is to be ugly because you lose all harmony, and without
harmony there is no beauty, no grace.</p><p><br></p><p>THE SOUL OF MAN LOVES PURITY...</p><p><br></p><p>If you reach to your innermost core you will suddenly find innocence
arising in you, roses of innocence flowering.</p><p><br></p><p>... BUT HIS MIND IS OFTEN REBELLIOUS.</p><p><br></p><p>But the mind is not willing just to be innocent. Innocence says yes,
it is trust; the mind says no, it is doubt. The mind always lives
through the no, it is negative; the soul is always positive. The soul
has no idea of saying no, it knows nothing about the no; and the mind
knows nothing about the yes. If the mind sometimes has to say yes, it
only says it unwillingly. You can watch it in yourself: whenever your
mind says yes it says it unwillingly because it cannot find any way of
saying no, that’s why it says yes. Yes is not spontaneous for the mind;
no is spontaneous.</p><p><br></p><p>Watch the truth of this statement. These are not theories,
hypotheses, these are simple facts. You can just watch it in yourself:
the first thing that happens to your mind is no; it immediately says no
– even if there is no reason to say no.</p><p><br></p><p>Just the other day I received a letter from a sannyasin: “Osho, when
you talked about Prem Chinmaya’s coming back, his dying from the sixth
center and that he will have to live only one more life, I cannot
believe you or trust you.”</p><p><br></p><p>You may not know anything about reincarnation; you can simply say, “I
don’t know about it, so how can I believe or disbelieve?” You can remain
open. But you will not miss any opportunity of saying no. Now, this
sannyasin must be waiting for something to say no to. Do you know what
it means to die from the sixth center? Have you any idea of the inner
physiology of man?</p><p><br></p><p>Ask Puja and Sheela what happened when Chinmaya died. They were
surprised – they could not believe what was happening: his whole body
became cool, his head became very hot. He complained also that something
strange was happening “... as if my whole energy is coming into the
head. My body is cool and calm, but my head is feeling almost as if it
is on fire.”</p><p><br></p><p>Whenever the soul leaves the body, the center that becomes its
leaving center becomes hot – naturally, because the whole energy
concentrates there. The energy that is spread all over the body gathers
together at one point; that point certainly becomes absolute fire.</p><p>You don’t know anything about the inner physiology. If you don’t
know, I am not telling you to believe in it – I am the last person to
tell you to believe in anything – but there is no need to say no either;
you can simply remain open, you can say, “I will see what happens when I
die.”</p><p><br></p><p>And then he says, “I don’t believe you, I don’t trust you. Does it
matter?” To me it does not matter, not at all, because I don’t depend on
your belief, but it matters immensely for you. I am not saying force
yourself to say yes to me, because a forced yes will be only a disguised
no, I am simply saying being here be open. There is no need to say yes
or no, you can simply say, “I don’t know.” Function out of a state of
not-knowing so that you remain available to experiment, to experience.
If you say no you have become closed, and yes you can say only when you
have experienced. So I am not asking you to believe in it, but I will
certainly request you not to disbelieve. There is no need for belief and
no need for disbelief. But this sannyasin’s mind must have been waiting
for some opportunity.</p><p><br></p><p>It is very rare here because I don’t talk about things which you will
find difficult to believe – I rarely talk about things which are beyond
you. I leave them; I prepare you so that you can experience them one
day. But once in a while something happens. For example, Prem Chinmaya’s
death was such an occasion that I had to say something about death,
something about which center he died from. I had to say this, that he
will be back here soon. And these things are not beyond your
comprehension if you are going deep into meditation, but if you are not
going into deep meditation they are beyond comprehension.</p><p><br></p><p>The mind wants to say no and if you listen to the mind you stop
listening to the Master. If you want to listen to the Master, first you
have to be open so that one day yes can surface in you spontaneously. It
matters much as far as you are concerned.</p><p><br></p><p>Being here and saying no in some way simply means you will be
physically here and spiritually absent. It will be a sheer waste of your
time; then there is no need to be here.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole effort of this Buddhafield, the whole purpose of it, is to
help you to go beyond mind, to go beyond no.</p><p><br></p><p>Ko Hsuan’s sutra says:</p><p><br></p><p>THE SOUL OF MAN LOVES PURITY, BUT HIS MIND IS OFTEN REBELLIOUS. THE
MIND OF MAN LOVES STILLNESS, BUT HIS DESIRES DRAW HIM INTO ACTIVITY.</p><p><br></p><p>The soul loves purity, innocence; that’s its natural joy. The mind is
not interested in purity, in innocence, because innocence needs yes as a
foundation and mind lives through no. But because the mind continuously
says no it has to suffer much turmoil, hence there is a great need in
the mind to be still, to be silent, to be calm and quiet.</p><p><br></p><p>THE MIND OF MAN LOVES STILLNESS...</p><p><br></p><p>But then there is another outer circle in your being – the circle of
desires which don’t even allow you silence; they drag you into activity.
The mind drags you into no’s, into negativity; that disturbs your
purity. Yes is your innocence, no means you have lost your innocence.
Then there are desires which don’t leave you at the mind, they want some
activity; just no won’t do. They drag you into</p><p>a thousand and one activities – the Chinese expression is into “ten
thousand things”; they keep you constantly occupied – money, power,
prestige; they go on goading you, “Do this. Achieve this. Without
achieving this you are not a real man. Prove that you are powerful,
prove that you are great, prove that you are special.” And to prove it
you have to move almost into a state of insanity. That’s what politics
is.</p><p><br></p><p>Politics is the other pole, exactly the opposite pole to religion.
Religion takes you to the essence of your being and politics takes you
to the accidents of your desires. The desires keep you so occupied with
the mundane, with the futile, that you start forgetting everything that
is intrinsic, that is really valuable. Running after money, you forget
all about the inner treasure. Running after power, you forget all about
the power of Tao, which is the supreme power. Running after name and
fame, you forget completely that name and fame are just momentary. But
they go on goading you; they won’t leave you for a single moment. In the
night you will dream about desires, in the day you will run after
desires. And all desires are mirages, like the horizon that looks so
close that if you just go, within an hour you will be able to reach it.
But you never reach it because it does not really exist.</p><p><br></p><p>You go on forgetting everything: you forget the soul, the heaven; you
even forget the body, the earth. You become almost mad. All your
politicians are mad. All your people who are running after money are
mad, who are running after fame are mad. But because they are in the
majority, they appear to be absolutely right. In fact, the person who is
not interested in name and fame, power and prestige seems to be a little
out of his senses. What has happened to this man?</p><p><br></p><p>You will be asked again and again, “What has happened to you? Why are
you not interested in accumulating more money? What do you do just by
sitting silently looking inwards?” You will be condemned by the world
because the world consists of extroverts. They will call you introverts,
they will tell you that introversion is a kind of perversion, they will
tell you that you are selfish, that you are narcissistic, that you are
only interested in your own joy, that you should be concerned with
others, that you should live like everybody else, that you should be
part of the crowd. Of course, they are many and you will be very
alone.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus has said to his disciples, “I am sending you amongst wolves.”
And I know what he means. When I send you into the world I also know I
am sending you amongst wolves. You are trying to be silent, innocent,
childlike, and the world is trying to achieve just the opposite
ends.</p><p><br></p><p>WHEN A MAN IS CONSTANTLY ABLE TO GOVERN HIS DESIRES, HIS MIND BECOMES
SPONTANEOUSLY STILL.</p><p><br></p><p>Again wrong words have been used.</p><p><br></p><p>WHEN A MAN IS CONSTANTLY ABLE TO GOVERN HIS DESIRES...</p><p><br></p><p>No, Ko Hsuan cannot say “to govern his desires” because that means
repression, that means control. He can only say:</p><p><br></p><p>WHEN A MAN IS CONSTANTLY ABLE TO understand HIS DESIRES, HIS MIND
BECOMES SPONTANEOUSLY STILL.</p><p>Only understanding is needed; nothing else ever helps. If you
understand a desire it disappears. Desires are like darkness: you bring
light and darkness disappears. You need not throw it out, you need not
repress it, you need not close doors to keep it out – you cannot do
anything directly with darkness – you just have to bring light in. A
small candle will do, and all darkness disappears. Just a little light
of understanding and desires start disappearing. Then arises spontaneous
stillness.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember this word “spontaneous”; that is the key word as far as Tao
is concerned. WHEN THE MIND IS UNCLOUDED, THE SOUL IS SEEN TO BE
PURE.</p><p>And when there are no desires, thoughts automatically disappear,
because thoughts are servants of desires. When there are desires, your
mind is full of thoughts, full of plans – what to do, how to do, how to
fulfill these desires. When desires disappear you have cut the tree from
the very root. Then leaves start disappearing, branches disappear, the
tree itself disappears of its own accord, and the mind is unclouded. In
that unclouded state of mind, in that thoughtless state of mind you will
be able to see the purity of your inner being.</p><p><br></p><p>THEN, WITH CERTAINTY THE SIX DESIRES WILL CEASE TO BE BEGOTTEN AND
THE THREE POISONS WILL BE ELIMINATED AND DISSOLVED.</p><p><br></p><p>This is something very significant to remember.</p><p><br></p><p>All the religions have talked only about five senses it is only Tao
that talks about six senses. All the religions have talked about five
desires because man consists of five senses; Tao talks about six
desires. The insight is tremendous because just recently, just in this
century, science has discovered the sixth sense; otherwise the sixth
sense was not known. Your ear has two senses; your ear is not a single
sense – hidden inside it is another sense: the sense that keeps your
body balanced.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why when you see a drunkard walking you can see that he cannot
walk straight; zigzag he goes. His steps are not in harmony for the
simple reason that alcohol affects the sixth sense, that which keeps
your body balanced. It has been a Taoist insight for five thousand years
that there are six senses. Through the eye the desire for beauty arises,
through the ear the desire for music arises, from the nose the desire
for nice smells arises, from the tongue the desire for taste, and from
the whole skin the desire to touch – these are the five traditional
senses – and from the sixth sense the desire to remain in control,
balanced. If somebody hits your ear hard you will lose balance; you will
see stars in the day.</p><p><br></p><p>These six desires no longer arise. Not that the eyes go blind; in
fact, now they can see beauty more truly, but there is no desire to
possess beauty. Not that you become deaf to music, but now there is no
desire to possess anything. You enjoy more because your energy is free
and your senses are more clear, more transparent.</p><p><br></p><p>Nobody can see beauty more clearly than a Buddha, nobody can hear
music more deeply than a Lao Tzu, nobody can taste better than Jesus.
All their senses become truly sensitive, they are real senses. Your
senses are dull. Your society helps you to keep them dull because the
society is afraid: if your senses are really very keen and very
sensitive then you can be a dangerous person because of your desire to
possess. You see a beautiful woman: she is somebody else’s wife, and if
your eyes</p><p>are really able to see the beauty and you have the desire to possess
also then you will grab the woman, you will escape with the woman, you
will rape the woman. Something criminal is bound to happen.</p><p><br></p><p>Nature allows you total sensitivity only when you become capable of
dropping all possessiveness, all idea of possessing. Then you can touch,
and then even rocks feel velvety. Then everything starts having a divine
quality, everything is transformed.</p><p><br></p><p>... AND THE THREE POISONS WILL BE ELIMINATED AND DISSOLVED.</p><p><br></p><p>What are the three poisons? The first is sexuality – not sex,
remember, but sexuality. Sex is natural. Tao is not against sex, it is
the only religious approach which is in total agreement with sex. Tao
has its own science of sex, it has its own Tantra, which really goes far
deeper than Indian Tantra. But sexuality is a totally different
phenomenon; sexuality means a perverted state of sex energy. Then it
becomes poisonous.</p><p><br></p><p>The second poison is anger and the third poison is greed. Sexuality,
anger, greed: these three poisons combined together, this unholy
trinity, creates your ego. And all these three can be dissolved,
eliminated. If sexuality disappears you will be surprised that anger
disappears – without any effort on your part. Anger simply means that
your sexuality is hindered. Anybody who hinders your sexuality creates
anger in you; he is your enemy. And sexuality creates greed; greed is a
form of sexuality, it is a perverted form. Money becomes your object of
love because the society does not allow any other kind of love. It
allows money, power; they can become your objects of love. It helps to
change your object of love. First it changes your sex into
sexuality...</p><p><br></p><p>See the difference. Sex is a natural phenomenon; it is your capacity
to reproduce. Sexuality means your mind is continuously occupied by sex;
it is no more a natural phenomenon, it has become cerebral. It is no
more confined to the sex center, it has gone to the head. Now you are
constantly thinking.</p><p><br></p><p>Just watch for one hour how many times you think of sex – you will be
surprised. Psychologists say that you are in for a great surprise if you
watch your mind to see how many times in an hour you think about sex.
Men think about it twice as much as women do; that may be one of the
causes of conflict between them. They have a different kind of
sexuality. Man’s sexuality is more repressed than woman’s for the simple
reason that man has to earn money, has to become famous, has to be a
prime minister or a politician. Naturally, from where is he going to get
all this energy to be the president? There is only one energy; you don’t
have many energies in you, mind you, you have only one kind of energy.
Whatsoever name you want to give to it you can give, “xyz”, but you have
only one kind of energy. Sigmund Freud has called it libido, but it
simply means sex. Now if you want to have more money or more power, you
want to be the president of the country or the prime minister of the
country, then you have to take your sexuality and channelize it.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard:</p><p><br></p><p>One day Carter and Brezhnev met for a long meeting. The two wives
waited outside the meeting room for so many hours, they eventually
struck up a conversation. Soon they were finding they liked each other
and were sharing intimacies.</p><p>Rosalyn Carter confessed, “You won’t believe this, my dear Brezhnova,
but Jimmy just isn’t the same man I married. For such a long time now he
hasn’t even looked at me. He comes home so tired he immediately goes to
bed and falls asleep.”</p><p><br></p><p>“With me it is the same,” said Brezhnova. “I just don’t know what to
do.”</p><p><br></p><p>“The other night,” explained Rosalyn Carter, “I finally decided to
tempt Jimmy. I put on my transparent black negligee and some expensive
perfume, turned down the lights, put some sexy French music on the
stereo and piled pillows on the bed. And then I waited for him in the
bedroom.</p><p><br></p><p>“He came into the bedroom already talking about all the problems in
the Middle East, the dollar going down, etcetera, etcetera, and I threw
him down on the pile of pillows, took off his shirt, opened up my
negligee to show him my bare breasts and asked him, ‘Jimmy, does this
remind you of anything?’</p><p><br></p><p>“He looked at my tits, put his hand to his forehead and said, ‘Of
course... I must call Moshe Dayan!’”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s nothing,” said Brezhnova. “With me it was worse. I did
everything you did, except I didn’t bother with the negligee. As soon as
he lay down on the bed I jumped on him and put my cunt right in front of
his face and said, ‘Look at this, Brezy... does it remind you of
something?’ And he replied, ‘Oh yes! I forgot to call Fidel
Castro!’”</p><p><br></p><p>It is bound to happen. You have to divert your sexual energy; then
money, power, prestige, they become your sexual objects. And these
people can talk about morality and discipline easily; they can teach
others how to control their sexuality very easily, but in fact what they
are doing is nothing but a perversion of sex. And these people become
very violent; they are violent – they keep the whole world always on the
brink of war.</p><p><br></p><p>When sex becomes perverted, love becomes hatred. Nothing is wrong
with sex, but everything is wrong with sexuality. Sex should be allowed
a natural flow. Yes, one day, if you live it naturally, transcendence
happens; but it is spontaneous, it is not celibacy. It comes through
celebration.</p><p><br></p><p>Just as at the age of fourteen you become mature sexually, at the age
of forty-two, if you have lived your sex naturally, you will go beyond
it. But it is a strange world. Children become sexual, children who are
not sexually mature, because the whole atmosphere is poisoned. Small
children start thinking of sex. Seeing films, reading novels, looking at
obscene magazines, they start thinking about sex.</p><p><br></p><p>Italian Piero comes to a village. He asks a farmer, “Do you know
where little children come-a from?” “They grow out of cabbages!” the
farmer answers.</p><p>Piero walks a little further and meets the milkman. “Hey!” says
Piero. “Do ya know where little children come-a from!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sure,” answers the milkman, “the stork brings them.”</p><p><br></p><p>Piero continues on his way a little despondent, then...”Ah!” he
thinks, “here comes-a the right-a man to ask-a! Vicar! Do ya know where
little children come-a from?”</p><p>“Yes, my son,” responds the Vicar. “God sends them from heaven.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Shit-a!’ exclaims Piero.”Isn’t there anyone in this-a village who
fucks-a?”</p><p><br></p><p>Children become sexual before their time, and then you will find
eighty year-old men running after women. Both are in an unnatural
state.</p><p><br></p><p>Tao believes in total naturalness. It is not against sex, it is
against sexuality, because it knows that if sexuality does not enter in
your life – that means if perversion does not enter in your life – if
nobody teaches you to be against sex there will be no perversion. It is
because of your saints and moralists and puritans that you all have
become perverted – children and old men, all. If sex is left alone
without interference from any moral teaching, then one day the child
will become sexually mature nearabout fourteen, and one day nearabout
forty-two he will transcend it. He will have seen by that time that it
is child’s play and enough is enough. And that transcendence is
beautiful. Anything that happens on its own is beautiful because it
comes through Tao. And then anger will not be there in your mind,
neither will greed.</p><p><br></p><p>THE REASON MEN DO NOT POSSESS THE ABILITY TO ACHIEVE THIS IS BECAUSE
THEIR MINDS ARE NOT CLEAR AND THEIR DESIRES ARE UNRESTRAINED.</p><p><br></p><p>Meditation brings both clarity and a certain inner discipline. And by
“meditation” Tao simply means watching your mind and its functions.</p><p><br></p><p>HE WHO HAS THE POWER TO TRANSCEND HIS DESIRES, LOOKING WITHIN AND
CONTEMPLATING MIND...</p><p><br></p><p>That is the definition of meditation according to Ko Hsuan:</p><p><br></p><p>... LOOKING WITHIN AND CONTEMPLATING MIND...</p><p><br></p><p>Just silently watching all the processes of the mind – thoughts,
memories, imagination, dreams, desires – a realization happens, a
realization that:</p><p><br></p><p>... IN HIS MIND, MIND IS NOT...</p><p><br></p><p>This sutra is immensely significant. When you watch the mind clearly,
silently, the mind starts disappearing. More watchfulness, less mind.
One percent watchfulness, ninety-nine percent mind. Ninety-nine percent
watchfulness, one percent mind. One hundred percent watchfulness and
there is no mind in the mind. All thoughts have gone, the mind is
absolutely empty. And in that emptiness Tao comes in, rushes in. You
have created the right space for it.</p><p><br></p><p>... LOOKING WITHOUT AND CONTEMPLATING FORM...</p><p><br></p><p>Then you are capable of looking without. First look within, let the
mind disappear, attain to clarity, then look without.</p><p><br></p><p>... LOOKING WITHOUT AND CONTEMPLATING FORM...</p><p>Then meditate on the forms outside: the trees, the clouds, the stars,
the moon...</p><p><br></p><p>... BE REALIZES THAT IN FORM, FORM IS NOT...</p><p><br></p><p>Then you will be surprised to see that the waves are not there, only
the ocean. In the form there is no form. The trees are not there but
only life expressing itself in millions of forms but not confined to any
form; it is formless.</p><p><br></p><p>... LOOKING AT THINGS STILL MORE REMOTE AND CONTEMPLATING MATTER, HE
REALIZES THAT IN MATTER, MATTER IS NOT.</p><p><br></p><p>That too is of great significance. It is only now that modern
physicists have said that matter does not exist, but Tao has been saying
for five thousand years that:</p><p><br></p><p>... IN MATTER, MATTER IS NOT.</p><p><br></p><p>If you can meditate, start from within, then look around and then
look into things at their deepest core. First mind disappears, then form
disappears, then matter disappears. Then what is left? That which is
left is Tao, is nature. And to live in that nature is to live in
freedom, is to live in eternal bliss.</p><p><br></p><p>“Tao” is the word of Ko Hsuan for God. “Dhamma” is the word of Buddha
for Tao. Buddha says: AIS DHAMMO SANANTANO – this IS the eternal law.
Once you have seen the eternal law you become part of eternity. Time is
transcended, space is transcended. You are no more and for the first
time you are. You are no more as a separate entity, but for the first
time you are the whole.</p><p><br></p><p>This is my vision too. My agreement with Tao is absolute. I cannot
say that about other religions; with Tao I can say it without any
hesitation. Tao is the most profound insight that has ever been achieved
on the earth.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part8>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

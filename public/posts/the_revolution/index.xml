‌CHAPTER 1
A Hand Beckoning
11 February 1978 am in Buddha Hall
THERE IS NOTHING BUT WATER IN THE HOLY POOLS, I KNOW, I HAVE BEEN SWIMMING IN THEM.
ALL THE GODS SCULPTED OF WOOD AND IVORY CAN’T SAY A WORD.
I KNOW, I HAVE BEEN CRYING OUT TO THEM.
THE SACRED BOOKS OF THE EAST ARE NOTHING BUT WORDS. I LOOKED THROUGH THEIR COVERS ONE DAY SIDEWAYS.</description>

‌CHAPTER 10
Through These Enchanted Lands
20 February 1978 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
THE REVOLUTION FEELS TO BE HOT, HEADY AND SHARP. WHEREAS LOVE FEELS TO BE SOFT, SMOOTH AND DELICATE. HOW DO LOVE AND REVOLUTION GO TOGETHER?
JUST as man and woman go together. Just as the head and the heart go together in you, just as the body and the soul go together in you.</description>

‌CHAPTER 2
The Stretched Soul Makes Music
12 February 1978 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
I HAVE JUST RECENTLY BEEN HELPED TO DISCOVER THAT NOBODY IS PERFECT AND TO LET GO OF MY FANTASY OF A PERFECT PERSON. NOW I AM LEFT WITH MY FEELINGS OF LOVING AND HATING THE SAME PERSON AND I FIND IT DIFFICULT TO LIVE WITH SUCH INTENSE, SEEMINGLY POLAR OPPOSITES IN MYSELF.</description>

‌CHAPTER 3
By A Fiery Intention
13 February 1978 am in Buddha Hall
ARE YOU LOOKING FOR ME? I AM IN THE NEXT SEAT: YOUR SHOULDER IS AGAINST MINE.
YOU WILL NOT FIND ME IN STUPAS, NOR IN INDIAN SHRINE ROOMS,
NOR IN THE SYNAGOGUE, NOR IN CATHEDRALS, NOT IN MASSES, NOR KIRTANS,
NOT IN LEGS TWISTING AROUND THE NECK, NOR IN EATING NOTHING BUT VEGETABLES.</description>

‌CHAPTER 4
Forth from your Caves
14 February 1978 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
YOU SAID THE OTHER DAY ‘JUST LOVE AND ACCEPT YOURSELF.’ GRADUALLY SELF ACCEPTANCE HAS BEEN GROWING IN MY LIFE. I HAVE HAD SEVERAL MOMENTS OF EXPERIENCING UNCONDITIONAL LOVE FROM THE UNIVERSE.
IN THESE THREE WEEKS SINCE BECOMING A SANNYASIN, THE MOST DIFFICULT AND MIND-BLOWING EXPERIENCE FOR ME HAS BEEN THE REALITY OF YOUR UNCONDITIONAL ACCEPTANCE OF ME AND EVERYTHING I AM AND DO.</description>

‌CHAPTER 5
The Pilgrims of Love
15 February 1978 am in Buddha Hall
I TALK TO MY INNER LOVER, AND I SAY, WHY SUCH RUSH? WE SENSE THAT THERE IS SOME SORT OF SPIRIT
THAT LOVES BIRDS AND ANIMALS AND THE ANTS. PERHAPS THE SAME ONE WHO GAVE A RADIANCE TO YOU IN YOUR MOTHER’S WOMB.
IT IS LOGICAL YOU WOULD BE WALKING AROUND ENTIRELY ORPHANED NOW?</description>

‌CHAPTER 6
The Birth of the New
16 February 1978 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
OSHO, WHY IS GROWTH PAINFUL?
Growth is painful because you have been avoiding a thousand and one pains in your life. By avoiding you cannot destroy them – they go on accumulating. You go on swallowing your pains; they remain in your system. That’s why growth is painful – when you start growing, when you decide to grow, you have to face all the pains that you have repressed.</description>

‌CHAPTER 7
It is Time Now!
17 February 1978 am in Buddha Hall
I KNOW THE SOUND OF THE ECSTATIC FLUTE, BUT I DON’T KNOW WHOSE FLUTE IT IS.
A LAMP BURNS AND HAS NEITHER WICK NOR OIL.
A WATERPLANT BLOSSOMS AND IT IS NOT ATTACHED TO THE BOTTOM. WHEN ONE FLOWER OPENS, ORDINARILY DOZENS OPEN.
THE MOON BIRD’S HEAD IS FILLED WITH NOTHING BUT THOUGHTS OF THE MOON,</description>

‌CHAPTER 8
This Orange Epidemic
18 February 1978 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
AS I COME TO UNDERSTAND MORE DEEPLY HOW COMPLETELY THE MIND HAS BEEN CONDITIONED IT SEEMS TO ME THAT EVEN THE GURU-DISCIPLE RELATIONSHIP IS AN EXPRESSION OF THIS CONDITIONING. FOR MAN TO BE TOTALLY LIBERATED, MUST HE NOT ALSO TRANSCEND THIS TRADITIONAL BELIEF BY LEAPING THROUGH LOVE IN THE WONDER AND MYSTERY OF LIFE ITSELF, BEYOND THE FORM OF GODS OR GURUS?</description>

‌CHAPTER 9
The Sword of Love-and-Death
19 February 1978 am in Buddha Hall
THE DARKNESS OF NIGHT IS COMING ALONG FAST, AND THE SHADOWS OF LOVE
CLOSE IN THE BODY AND THE MIND.
OPEN THE WINDOW TO THE WEST, AND DISAPPEAR INTO THE AIR INSIDE YOU.
NEAR YOUR BREASTBONE THERE IS AN OPEN FLOWER. DRINK THE HONEY THAT IS ALL AROUND THAT FLOWER. WAVES ARE COMING IN:</description>

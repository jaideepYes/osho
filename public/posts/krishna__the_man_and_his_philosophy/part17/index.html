BUT OUR DIFFICULTY IS THAT YOUR ENERGY IS SO POWERFUL THAT WE CANNOT KEEP PACE WITH YOU. IN THE BOOK NAMED “THE WAY OF THE WHITE CLOUD” IT IS SAID, “SOMETIMES I TAKE AWAY THE MAN, THE SUBJECT, BUT DO NOT TAKE AWAY THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THAT IS OBJECT. SOMETIMES I TAKE AWAY THE CIRCUMSTANCES, BUT DO NOT TAKE AWAY THE MAN. SOMETIMES I TAKE AWAY BOTH THE MAN AND THE CIRCUMSTANCES. AND SOMETIMES I TAKE AWAY NEITHER THE MAN NOR THE CIRCUMSTANCES.” YOU SPOKE ABOUT SHREE ARVIND THIS MORNING. I AGREE WITH YOU TO A LARGE EXTENT, BUT I HAVE SOME RESERVATIONS IN REGARD TO YOUR INTERPRETATION OF ARVIND SEEING VISIONS OF KRISHNA. THEN YOU SAY IT IS MEANINGLESS TO QUOTE SCRIPTURES LIKE THE VEDAS AND THE UPANISHADS IN SUPPORT OF WHAT ONE HAS TO SAY, BECAUSE IT REFLECTS ONE’S INFERIORITY COMPLEX. BUT KRISHNA THINKS DIFFERENTLY. HE SAYS TO ARJUNA, “I TEACH YOU THE KNOWLEDGE, THE WISDOM THAT IS AVAILABLE TO ME FROM ANADIKAL OR TIME INFINITE.” KRISHNA ASSERTS THAT THE WISDOM HE BRINGS TO THIS EARTH BELONGS TO INFINITY. BUT BUDDHA CLAIMS THAT HIS WISDOM IS FOUNDED ON PERSONAL EXPERIENCE, ALTHOUGH HIS CONCEPT OF NIRVANA OR ULTIMATE FREEDOM IS THE SAME AS IS FORMULATED BY THE FIRST UPANISHAD AND THE BHAGWAD GEETA. AND DR. RADHAKRISHNAN SAYS THAT BUDDHA’S TEACHINGS ARE NOTHING BUT EXTENSIONS OF UPANISHADIC PRINCIPLES. UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, IT IS DIFFICULT TO VOUCH FOR ONE’S AUTHENTICITY. WE FIND OURSELVES IN DIFFICULTY\nIN REGARD TO YOUR STYLE, THE WAY YOU SPEAK. IT SEEMS YOU OVERWHELM US WITH YOUR LOGIC, BUT WHEN YOU COME TO FACTS THINGS BECOME EASIER FOR US. WHEN I CAME HERE I HAD A FEELING THAT COMING IN CONTACT WITH RAJNEESH, THE ICE OF MY EGO WILL MELT AND DISAPPEAR. AND IT IS TRUE THAT MY EGO HAS DIMINISHED TO A LARGE EXTENT. PLEASE COMMENT.\nTruth is beginningless.\nThe UPANISHAD’S word anadi does not mean old, it means beginningless. Anadi means that which has no be ginning, the beginningless. It does not mean ancient as you seem to think. However old and ancient a thing may be, it has a beginning, but truth has no beginning. And that which becomes old cannot be truth, because truth is now, in this moment.\nTruth is neither new nor old. What is called a new truth is going to become old in the future. What is now called old was new sometime in the past, and what is new today will grow old tomorrow. It is in the nature of things that everything new becomes old. Truth is neither of the two; truth is eternal. Or you can say that which is eternal is truth. So anadi means the eternal, not old and ancient.\nWhen Krishna says, “I teach the truth that is ANADI,” it does not mean that he is talking about some old and ancient truth. Krishna means to say that which is, is truth. He says, “I teach you the eternal truth.” Those who knew it in the past – if they really knew it – knew the truth that is eternal. And those who know it today – if they really know it – know the same eternal truth. And those who will know it in the future, if they really know, it will be the same truth that is without beginning and without end. Only falsehood can be old and new; truth cannot be new or old.\nOf course, there are two ways of saying the truth.\nWhen Buddha speaks about truth he does not refer to all those who have known truth in the past, there is no need. When he knows truth on his own, he need not produce witnesses in his support; that would make no difference whatsoever. What he knows he knows; witnesses are not going to add anything to it. Even a thousand names of people who have known truth will not add one iota to the measure of Buddha’s truth, nor will they add to the glory and grandeur of truth itself. That is why Buddha says it directly as he has known it.\nAnd Buddha does so deliberately; there is a good reason why he does not mention the names of the old seers. In Buddha’s time these authoritative names were being misused and they carried a danger with them. Remember, whenever Buddha said something he always asked his listeners not to accept it just because somebody else knows and says it. He always warned his listeners against authority. Throughout his life, Buddha insisted that unless someone knows truth on his own, he should not accept it as true on the authority of others – including Buddha.\nBuddha is speaking to seekers; his listeners are all seekers of truth. They are very different from Krishna’s solitary listener, Arjuna. It is essential for a master to ask his disciples, the seekers of truth not to accept anything, not to believe just because he says it. If they believe something as true, they cannot go on the quest for truth. And if Buddha cites authorities in his support he is laying a precedent for coming generations to cite him as an authority. So he steers clear of all previous authorities and says plainly, “I say to you what I have known, but don’t accept it until you know it for yourselves.”\nBut Krishna speaks to an altogether different kind of person, his listener is not a seeker of truth, he is not on an adventure to find truth. Arjuna is quite different from the disciples of Buddha. Arjuna is not seeking truth, he is confused and deluded. The situation of imminent war has overcome him with weakness and fear. So Krishna is not interested in unveiling and exposing truth to its roots – he only tells him what truth is.\nArjuna has not come to him for truth; he wants Krishna to dispel his confusion and fear. There fore Krishna says that what he is saying has been said by many others in the past. If Arjuna happened to be a seeker. Krishna would certainly ask him to prepare himself for an encounter with truth. But Arjuna wants only to understand what reality is; he is not prepared to go in search of truth. He is not in an ashram or a monastery to learn truth from a master; he is preparing to wage war. And being confronted with the special conditions of the Mahabharat he is frightened and depressed. So Krishna, in order to dispel his despondency and bolster his morale, tells him that what he is saying has the support of many wise men of the past, that it is the eternal wisdom.\nThis kind of teaching has relevance and meaning for Arjuna. If Arjuna had come to him on his own with a desire to find truth, it would have been altogether different. But this is not the case. That is why Krishna explains to him the long tradition of truth so that Arjuna can grasp it properly.\nThere is yet another reason for Krishna’s taking this approach.\nIf a person goes to Buddha, he goes as a disciple, as one surrendered to him. Arjuna is Krishna’s friend, he is not surrendered to him. Much depends on particular situations and relationships. While Buddha’s disciples accept what he says, his own wife refuses to take him at his word. When Buddha returns home after twelve years – during which time he is widely known as the Buddha, the awakened one, and people from all over have come to his feet in search of the truth he has known and proclaimed – his wife Yashodhara, on meeting him, refuses to accept him as Buddha. She takes him to be the same person who had left his home stealthily in the dead of night twelve years ago. And she resumes the argument from that very point. She is as angry as she was the following morning when she had come to know how her husband had deserted her, and she vehemently accuses Buddha of betraying her.\nBuddha’s wife has her own characteristics. If Buddha tells her straight off that he is now a Buddha, she would say, “Don’t talk nonsense, I know who you are. Nobody is a Buddha.” If Buddha has to communicate with his wife he will do it very differently, because she is altogether different from his devotees and other seekers. There is a sweet story related with this episode.\nWhen Buddha initiated Ananda into sannyas, because he was his elder cousin, Ananda exacted three promises from him. At the time of initiation he said to Buddha, “Before I become your disciple, I would like to have a few assurances from you. Since I am your elder cousin brother, I am your senior and am in a position to command you to do certain things. Once I become your disciple, your junior, I will lose that status; then you will be in a position to command me and I will do your bidding. Right now you are my younger cousin brother, so give me three promises.” Buddha asked him what his desires were.\nAnanda said, “Firstly, I will always be with you from morning to morning; you will never send me away from you on an errand. Secondly, if I bring any visitors to you – even at odd hours of the night\n– you will never say no to them. And you will answer every question I will put to you at any time and place. And thirdly, I will attend, if I want to, even your very private and confidential discussions with your visitors.” Being the younger brother, Buddha not only accepted Ananda’s conditions, he honored them throughout his life. He never felt any difficulty about it.\nBut when he returned to his home town after twelve years and was going to visit his wife, Yashodhara, these promises given to Ananda years ago came in the way. Ananda, as usual, wanted to be with him during his meeting with his wife, but for the first time Buddha felt embarrassed. He said to Ananda, “Just think, I am going to visit her after twelve long years. And for her I am not Buddha, but the same old Gautam Siddhartha, her husband who left her in the dead of night without informing her. And you know she is a proud woman and she will take offense if you come with me; she will think it is a strategy to prevent her from expressing all her bottled-up resentment and frustration. sorrow and suffering. I am aware of my promise, but I beg of you not to insist on it for once.”\nThis is a very sensitive and delicate moment and Buddha’s response to it is so human and beautiful. When Ananda reminds him that he has transcended all associations and attachments – no one is now a wife or a son to him – Buddha tells him, “This is quite true, Ananda, as far as I am concerned. But for Yashodhara I am her husband, and it is not in my hands to undo it.”\nAnanda keeps out of Buddha’s way. ’When Buddha meets Yashodhara the expected happens. She bursts out crying; all the pent-up anger and pain and agony she has silently suffered for twelve years comes out in a torrent. Her outburst is quite justifiable. Buddha listens to her very silently. When she quiets down and wipes away her tears, Buddha says to her very gently, “Yashodhara, look at me attentively. I am not the same person who had left you twelve years back. I don’t come back to you as your husband, the husband is no more. I am altogether different. You talked so long to the departed one; now you can talk to me.”\nThe relationship between Krishna and Arjuna is radically different; they are friends. They have played and gossiped together as intimate pals. If Krishna tells him only this much, “I speak about the truth that I have known,” Arjuna will retort, “I know you and your truth.” So he has to say, “What I say is the same truth that has been said by many other seers. Don’t take it amiss because it comes to you from a friend. What I say is really significant.”\nThe GEETA is the product of a particular situation; and this has to be borne in mind, otherwise there is much room for misunderstanding. Buddha’s situation is different from Krishna’s. He can afford to say, “What I say is truth; I am not concerned with what others say about it. And I also urge you not to accept it on my authority. You need to come to it on your own.” And it is not an egoist’s statement. An egoist would insist on being accepted as an authority. Buddha is simply stating his individual experience to stimulate the thirst for truth in his listeners. He tells them again not to take it as a belief, but go on their own search for truth. But he is also clear that what he says is his own experience. This is simply a state, ment of fact.\nWe are aware that what Buddha says has been said by others too. We know that the Vedas and UPANISHADS have already said what Buddha says. But why doesn’t Buddha say so? There are reasons for it, and the reasons are inherent in the conditions of Buddha’s time. By the time of Buddha, the tradition of the Vedas and UPANISHADS had completely degenerated and decayed,\nit was really corrupt and rotten. To say a word in favor of these old scriptures was tantamount to providing support to a decadent and rotting tradition. Knowing well that the Vedas and the UPANISHADS contained the same truth, Buddha could not take their support. Because it was with their support that a monster of falsehoods, superstitions and crass hypocrisy was stalking the land, mercilessly exploiting and oppressing the people. That is why he kept quiet about them.\nIt is not that Buddha is not aware that the Vedas and UPANISHADS contain the truth. But it often happens in history that when a new Buddha comes he has to fight and uproot many old truths, because being old they get so badly mixed up with falsehoods that to support them would automatically strengthen those lies.\nKrishna did not have to face such a situation. In his time the tradition of the Vedas and the UPANISHADS was very much alive. It was really at the height of its glory, absolutely unpolluted and pure. For this very reason we say Krishna’s Geeta is the quintessence of the Vedas and the UPANISHADS. In fact, we can say Krishna himself is the embodiment of the great culture which had come out of these scriptures. Krishna reflects all that is essential and basic to that culture; he comes at a time when the Vedic civilization was at its zenith. Buddha comes when it had touched its nadir. It was the same culture, but Buddha had to witness its utter decadence and degradation, when the brahmins had ceased to be knowers of truth and instead were busy exploiting people in the name of God and religion. Every conceivable filth and ugliness, corruption and depravity had entered this culture, which now had nothing to do with religion.\nKrishna represents the summit of UPANISHADIC teachings. In his times the UPANISHADS have touched the pinnacle of attainment and splendor. The light of knowledge emanating from them is spreading in all directions, and their perfume is everywhere in the air. The UPANISHADS are not a dead thing, they are fully alive and youthful and their music can be heard even in the bushes and shrubs of the land. So when Krishna talks about them, he is not talking about something old and dead; he is talking about something which is in the prime of its youth.\nBut by the time Buddha comes, twenty-five hundred years after Krishna, the whole tradition is dying and rotting, only its corpse is Lying before him. Clearly, Buddha cannot invoke their support. It is not out of any arrogance that he declares his truth on his own.\nAt the same time there is nothing egoistic about Krishna when he seeks the support of the old seers and their sayings.\nQuestion 2\nQUESTIONER: KRISHNA, IN CHAPTER TEN OF THE GEETA DESCRIBES HIMSELF TO BE THE GANGES AMONG THE RIVERS, THE SPRING AMONG THE SEASONS, THE LION AMONG THE BEASTS, THE GARUDA OR EAGLE AMONG THE BIRDS, THE EIRAWAT AMONG THE ELEPHANTS, THE KAMDHENU AMONG THE COWS, VASUKI AMONG THE SNAKES, AND SO ON. DOES IT MEAN THAT HE IS TRYING TO DECLARE HIMSELF TO BE THE BEST AND THE GREATEST IN ALL CREATION? DOES IT ALSO MEAN THAT HE REFUSES TO REPRESENT ALL THAT IS LOWLY AND BASE? WHY DOES HE EXCLUDE THE MEANEST OF US ALL? AND WHERE DOES THE MEANEST BELONG?\nIt is a significant question. And there are two beautiful aspects to it.\nFirstly, Krishna declares himself to be the best among all things – of all the seasons he is the spring, of all the cows he is the kamdhenu, of all the elephants he is the eirawat. And secondly – and this is more significant – he finds his peers even among the lowliest of creatures like cows and horses. Both things should be taken together. While he declares himself to be the best among different classes of creatures, he does not distinguish between one class and another. Even when he claims to be the eirawat among elephants, he remains nonetheless an elephant. Even when he claims to be the best among the cows he remains a cow. Similarly he is quite at home among snakes and reptiles. He does not exclude the meanest categories as you think. He chooses to be the best even among the meanest creatures of this universe. And there is a reason. But why does he declare him self to be the best and the greatest among us all?\nOn the surface it seems to us to be an egoistic declaration, because we are so much involved with our egos that everything we see appears egoistic. But if we go deep into it we will know what a great message is enshrined in Krishna’s declaration. When he says that he is the eirawat among the elephants, he means to say every elephant is destined to be an eirawat, and if one fails to be eirawat he fails to actualize his best and highest potential. Similarly every season has the potential to grow into a spring, and if one fails to attain to the highest in its nature, it fails its nature. And if a cow fails to be the kamdhenu, it means she has gone astray from her nature. In all these declarations, Krishna says only one thing: that he is the culmination, the perfection of nature in everything. Whoever and whatever attains to the sublime reflects godliness. This is the central message of this declaration. Please understand its deeper significance.\nIt is not that an elephant who does not become the eirawat is not a Krishna, he too is a Krishna, but a backward Krishna; he has failed to be the eirawat which is his potential. Krishna says he reflects the innate potentiality of each being come to its completion, that each being can grow into Krishnahood, god-hood. Krishna symbolizes the actualized form at its best, the highest of each one’s possibility. Every being, every thing is capable of attaining to Krishna-hood. And if one fails to realize himself fully, it simply meanS that he has betrayed his innate nature, he has deviated from it. There is not even a trace of egoism in Krishna’s declaration. This is his way of saying that one cannot attain to godliness unless he becomes like the lion among animals, like the spring among the seasons, like the Ganges among the rivers. One comes to God only when one attains to one’s own fullest flowering, not otherwise.\nBy way of these illustrations Krishna persuades Arjuna that if he flowers to the maximum as a warrior – which is his innate nature – he will be. come a Krishna in his own right. Had Krishna been born two thousand years later he would have said, “I am Arjuna among the warrior.”\nWhen Krishna declares his being, he is not claiming greatness. To claim greatness he need not compare himself with beasts and birds, snakes and reptiles. Claims to greatness can be made directly, but Krishna really does not claim any greatness for himself. He Is speaking about a law of growth, a universal law which is that when you draw out the best in you, when you actualize your highest potential you become God.\nOne of the Sanskrit names of God Is Ishwar, which Is derived from aishwarya, meaning affluence. It means when you attain to the peak of affluence as a being, you become God. But we never pay attention to this aspect of godliness, which is affluence in every respect. So to be the lion among the animals, the kamdhenu among the cows, and the spring among the seasons is to attain to godliness,\nto God. When there is no difference whatsoever between your potentiality and actuality, you become God. When the highest possibility of your life is actualized you attain to Godhood.\nIf there is a distance between your potential and actual states of being, it means you are yet on the way to your destiny. And godliness is everybody’s destiny; it is really everyone’s birthright. When that which is hidden in you becomes manifest, you are God. Right now you are part hidden and part manifest, you are on the way to flowering. You have yet to burst into a full spring, you have yet to become God. If Krishna happens to visit our garden here and says that he is the most blossomed one among all the flowers of this garden, what does he mean by it? He means to say that other flowers have the potential to achieve this flowering, and they are on the way to it.\nIt is right that Krishna does not relate himself with flowers yet hidden in their buds or in their seeds. He connects himself only with those that have fully flowered. And there is a reason for it. He is speaking to Arjuna who is depressed and confused, and he is not only trying to revive him but also to inspire him to blossom fully as a warrior, to actualize his potential as a warrior. Then alone, Krishna says, can he attain to God, to the utmost peak.\nHere Krishna is having to play a double role. Because Arjuna is his friend, he cannot be too hard with him. He has to speak as a friend but all the time he is aware that he has to help Arjuna to come to the same flowering of being which he embodies in himself. Therefore, from time to time he gives glimpses of his own flowering, of his own fullness, so that these glimpses gently seep into Arjuna’s awareness.\nKrishna will be of no use to Arjuna if he re mains only his friend, but if he reveals his godliness indiscriminately, Arjuna may be so frightened that he runs away. So all the time he has to strike a balance between the two roles he is playing. While he continues to be Arjuna’s friend he also declares his godliness from time to time. Whenever he finds Arjuna is relaxed, he declares his godliness. And when Arjuna is assailed with doubt and confusion he returns to his friendly approach. His task is very delicate, and very few Buddhas have had to deal with such a situation as Krishna faces in the war of the Mahabharat.\nBud\u0026a does not have to deal with such a delicate situation. He knows his people clearly; he knows who is who and what they want. His people have come to sit at his feet to learn truth from him, so communication with them is easy and straight. Mahavira too, has no such difficulties with his listeners. Krishna’s difficulty with Arjuna is real, he has to play a double role.\nIt is really difficult to teach a friend, to be his teacher It is difficult even to be an advisor to an intimate friend. If you try he will say, “Shut up, don’t show off your wisdom.” Arjuna can say to Krishna, “Keep your sage advices to yourself, I know how much you know, since we have grown together from child. hood.” Arjuna can run away in such a situation. So Krishna on the one hand placates him with phrases like “O great warrior,” and on the other he tells him “You are an ignoramus, you don’t know the reality.”\nIf you bear in mind this aspect of the GEETA, you will have no difficulty understanding it. Question 3\nQUESTIONER: THERE ARE TWO SIDES TO THE LIFE OF EVERY GREAT MAN. WHILE ONE SIDE IS PERSONAL AND PRIVATE, THE OTHER IS OPEN, PUBLIC. THESE FEW DAYS THAT YOU HAVE BEEN TALKING TO US ABOUT KRISHNA, WE HAVE BEEN HELPED TO UNDERSTAND SOME FEATURES OF HIS LIFE WHICH ARE SUCH THAT IF WE TRY TO IMITATE HIM TODAY WE WILL AT ONCE BE OSTRACIZED BY THE SOCIETY. WE CANNOT PLAY PRANKS WITH OUR GIRLFRIENDS IN THE STREETS; WE CANNOT RUN AWAY WITH THEIR CLOTHES WHILE THEY ARE BATHING IN A SWIMMING POOL; WE CANNOT DANCE WITH OUR RADHAS AS KRISHNA DANCES WITH HIS RADHA WHO IS HIS GIRLFRIEND, NOT HIS WIFE – EVEN IF WE ARE DEEP IN LOVE WITH THEM. BUT ANOTHER SIDE OF KRISHNA’S LIFE IS ABOVE-BOARD. HIS SAYINGS HAVE TREMENDOUS RELEVANCE FOR ALL TIMES – PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE. AND IT IS IN THIS CONTEXT THAT WE REQUEST YOU TO SHED LIGHT ON HIS PHILOSOPHY OF LIFE, ON HIS DISCIPLINE OF WORK, KNOWLEDGE AND NON-ATTACHMENT, AND HIS ART OF LIVING, SO THAT WE CAN EMULATE HIM IN OUR DAY TO DAY LIFE.\nDon’t think that only in the present it is difficult to play the role of Krishna; it was difficult in Krishna’s own times. Otherwise there would have been not only one, but any number of Krishnas. And if it seems difficult for you today to become Krishna-like, know that it would have been as difficult in Krishna’s time if you were his contemporaries. And for Krishna it would be as easy to be a Krishna today – if he were born again – as it was in his own days. But this illusion stems from our idea and habit of following and imitating others in every way. In fact, imitation is the beginning of all our problems.\nYou could never have imitated Krishna if you lived in his days, nor can you imitate him now. It is impossible. And if you do, you are right in saying that you will end up in a mess.\nI have been talking on Krishna’s life and philosophy not so that you will make him your ideal and imitate him. Nothing is farther from me than the idea of imitation. If we can understand Krishna’s life, it will help us to understand our own life in its right perspective. If we fully unfold and understand Krishna’s life, which is vast and multidimensional, it will enable us to unfold our own life and know it. But you will never understand Krishna if you think in terms of imitating him.\nIf we imitate someone or other, we will never understand him because of that. And we will never understand our own life. In fact, the reason we want to imitate someone is that we don’t want to take the trouble of understanding ourselves. It is convenient to live in somebody else’s shadow and imitate him; it is a way to escape the arduous task of understanding ourselves. Understanding begins when someone ceases to imitate others, to be like others, when he wants to know directly who he is and what he can be.\nThe life of one who has achieved his full unfoldment helps to understand one’s own life. It doesn’t mean that one becomes like him, becomes his carbon copy. To become like others is neither possible nor desirable. Everyone is different and will remain different.\nIf you think in terms of imitation when we are discussing Krishna – and it seems from your question that you do think in such terms – then you will never understand Krishna. Never mind Krishna, you will never understand yourselves.\nSecondly I would like to emphasize that although Krishna’s philosophy, his vision of truth is significant and useful, it is not to be imitated, followed. When I ask you not to imitate his life which is so rich and dynamic, how can I ask you to imitate his ideas and thoughts, even his truth expressed in words? No, you have only to understand them, not follow and imitate them.\nOf course as you understand Krishna your own understanding and intelligence will grow and deepen; it will enrich you in your own way, No ideas, no thoughts, no principles will help you; only understanding will. Understanding is the key, the master key.\nIt is unfortunate that imitation has become the hallmark of our life; we imitate from the cradle to the grave. We imitate others’ ways of living; we imitate their ideas and thoughts. We are nothing more than imitators in every aspect of life.\nBefore I go into Krishna’s philosophy, it is necessary to warn you against imitation and following. Don’t follow anyone, not even Krishna. I say so not because it is not possible today to play pranks on your girlfriends or to run away with their clothes or to dance with them in the streets, Everything is possible, there is no difficulty in it. And if dancing with girlfriends is difficult today, it was difficult in Krishna’s time too. Playing a flute was as difficult then as it is now. There is no basic difference between old and new times; the differences are minor. So it is not because of changed times that I ask you not to imitate. Imitation itself is wrong, utterly wrong, and it is always wrong. Imitation is suicidal. If you want to kill yourself, then only is imitation okay.\nKrishna never imitates anyone. Buddha does not follow others. Can you name a person whom Krishna or Buddha or Christ ever imitated? It is ironic that we imitate those who never imitated others. It is so absurd. So the first thing to know about men like Krishna is that they never follow and imitate others, howsoever great the others may be. Persons like Krishna, Buddha, and Christ, are the exquisite flowerings of individuality; they are not carbon copies of others.\nBut we all try to imitate others. And imitation is dangerous. Playing the flute or loving a Radha is not so dangerous. Even today one does not refrain from falling in love with somebody else’s wife. It happens almost every day. The husband is afraid of his wife, the wife is afraid of her husband, and yet extra marital relations happen everywhere. And it is no thing new, it has always been so. As long as husbands and wives ate there, their fear of each other will be there. And to be without husbands and wives is equally frightening. Man as he is is in fear. and this fear permeates his whole life.\nLet us first understand this fear, and then we will go into the matter of truth and reality. You are not afraid of imitating Krishna because of public opinion. Fear of imitation is more basic, and I would like to go into it before I take up your question on philosophy and truth. I did not go into Krishna’s personal life on my own, but because you had asked questions about it. And as you have raised the question of the fear of imitating Krishna, I will deal with it first and then take up the rest of the question.\nThe basic fear of imitation is quite different. Imitation in itself is unnatural and ugly and wrong. In this whole world no two persons are alike, the same; they cannot be. Each person is different, unique and incomparable. There is no way to compare you with any other person in the whole world. You are like you; you are you. Never a person like you has happened in the long past of mankind, and never one like you is going to happen again in the future. God is a creator; he is creativity itself; he\nis always original, and whatever he creates is original. He never makes a carbon copy, he has no use for carbon papers in the whole process of creation. He never repeats; you can’t accuse him of repetition. And therefore, if you deny your individuality and try to follow and be like somebody else, you are violating the fundamental law of life. Imitation is a crime against God. He made you an individual and you are trying to be somebody’s copy. He gave you individuality, and you are trying to impose somebody else’s personality on yourself, an alien personality. This is the basic fear and fundamental problem of our life.\nUp to now all religions of the world have taught imitation. Parents and teachers all over the world exhort young men and women from their early childhood to be like others, they never ask them to be like themselves, to be themselves. They insist to you, “Be like Krishna, Christ or Buddha, but never commit the mistake of being like yourself.” Why? How is it that all educational institutions in the world teach you to be imitators and they never ask you to be yourself?\nThere are good reasons for it. The most important reason is that if everyone becomes himself, he will be a free individual, a rebel – not a conformist, a camp follower. He will be a danger to the institutions of parents, teachers, priests, managers of society, and to society itself. Every society is afraid of non-conformists and rebels. It honors the conformists, the yes-sayers. That is why everybody, from the president down to the parents pressures children, with one voice, to be followers, imitators. Otherwise they can’t be certain who will turn into what.\nThere is no danger if you become like Rama, because everything about Rama is known, what he does and what he does not do. He is predictable. And if you become another Rama you will be as predictable, and society will know what you are going to do. And if you deviate from the outlined path they will declare you an outlaw and punish you.\nIf everyone is allowed to be himself, then it will be difficult to say what is right and what is wrong, what is virtue and what is sin. Therefore the society wants you to fit into its well-defined patterns and clear-cut molds. It does not care if by this effort your individuality is destroyed, your life is ruined, and your soul is impoverished. Its sole concern is to turn men into machines so that the status quo is maintained at any cost.\nIt seems man lives for society, society does not exist for man. The individual has no importance; he is just a cog in the social machine. It seems education is not meant for man; on the contrary, man is meant for education, for being educated the way the society wants. It seems tenets and doctrines are not made to serve man; on the contrary, man is born in the service of tenets and doctrines. It seems religion is not for man; man is for religion. It is ironic that man is not an end unto himself, he is just a means. And things that are meant to be means have become ends unto themselves. This is the danger. This is the curse of imitation, that man has been reduced into a thing, a non-entity.\nImitation is destructive, it kills the individual. And this danger is inner, spiritual; it is not circumstantial. It is a kind of slow poisoning. Whether you imitate Krishna or Buddha, it makes no difference; all imitation is suicidal.\nThere is no mold, no pattern, no type into which man can be fitted. Every person is a unique and different individual, and he is meant to be him self. This is his freedom, his birthright.\nSo when I am speaking to you about Krishna, let no one think even mistakenly that I want you to be like Krishna. I am against all following, all imitation, all comparisons. Every suffering that comes to man from external sources is secondary; the suffering that imitation and following brings in its wake is real and colossal. You cannot become like Krishna without being dead. And it is only dead people who are afraid – afraid of everything. You are afraid of being beaten by the public if you dance and sing like Krishna. This is the fear of the dead, the imitator. A man who is fully alive is himself; he does not imitate. The more one is alive the more he is himself. And an alive man, a real individual is not afraid of society; on the contrary, the society is afraid of him. And that is why the society condemns him.\nIt is amusing that every society slanders and condemns the free individual, who is the only alive person – but this is not the whole story. The free individual is condemned in the beginning and worshipped in the end. It has always been the case. If a fully alive man remains alive to the end, he is destined to be condemned first and worshipped and adored later. And a really free person is not afraid of condemnation, ostracism, even crucifixion.\nKrishna is one of those rare beings in man’s history who choose to be themselves. He is not concerned about what you say about him. Do you think he was accepted as Bhagwan or God in his own times? No, he was accused and condemned in every way. And even today you will not spare him unless you shut your eyes to many episodes of his life.\nDo you know how Jesus was crucified? He was condemned as a disreputable and dangerous person. When he was hanged he was not alone: he was placed between two thieves who were going to suffer the same fate. This was a declaration that Jesus was no better than the criminals. It is interesting that not only the people of Jerusalem – who had gathered in thousands to witness his crucifixion – had ridiculed him. Even one of the thieves on the cross made a joke at Jesus’ expense. He is reported to have said, “Since you and I are going to die together, we are kith and kin. So please save a place for me too in your father’s kingdom when I reach there.” Even a thief mocks Jesus and his kingdom of God. Not only his persecutors, not only the public of Jerusalem – even a criminal who was going to be hanged for theft thought Jesus was a good-for-nothing vagabond. He thought himself better because while he had done something to deserve punishment Jesus was going to be hanged for nothing.\nThe society in which Krishna or Christ, Mahavira or Buddha are born does not accept them as Bhagwans, incarnations and messiahs. At first it condemns them, calls them names, mocks them, persecutes them. But they are brave people and cannot be intimidated. They bear the insults and humiliations with a smile of compassion on their faces. So how long can you go on? You will feel embarrassed, conquered by their love, their forbearance and com passion. And you begin to honor and worship them. But they take your worship with the same detachment and equanimity with which they take your insults and curses, because really nothing affects them – neither fame nor infamy. And then the society hails them as God-incarnates.\nI attach importance to a discussion of Krishna’s life not because I want you to emulate him, but because he is the most beautiful and rare example of a multidimensional person. And if his treasures are laid before you they will help you uncover your own hidden treasures. This much importance Krishna has for me, nothing more. And remember, Krishna’s treasures are Krishna’s, and your treasures will be your own. And no one can say your treasures will not be even richer than Krishna’s.\nI want to remind you again that what happened to Krishna can happen to each one of you, and this awareness is enough. This whole discussion is just meant for this remembrance that you all are heirs to godliness.\nYou want to know about Krishna’s philosophy of life. This desire for a life philosophy stems from the same source; you want something ready-made, an ideology, a doctrine, a tenet which you can impose conveniently on yourself and be finished with it. I will take up his philosophy tomorrow, but for a different purpose. I want you just to understand your own life with its help. I don’t want you to accept and follow Krishna’s views and ideas. People like Krishna look at life with extraordinary eyes; their perception is rare. It penetrates the innermost depth of life, and it will be a great gift if for a while we can look at life through the eyes of Krishna. That will go a long way to change and deepen our own perception, our own perspective of life.\nYou are here in Manali, in the Himalayas, surrounded by beautiful hills and majestic mountains. But you can see only that much beauty in these mountains as your eyes, your perception, your perspective are capable of. Nicholas Roerich, the renowned painter, happened to live here for a long time. If you go and see his paintings, they will give you quite a different perspective of the same mountains; you will see them with the eyes of Roerich. He came to these mountains from distant Russia at a time when there were no roads as there are today to connect the Himalayas with the rest of the world. And once he saw the Himalayas he made them his lifelong home; he never left again. These very mountains before you now had possessed Roerich, enchanted him.\nYou have been in the Himalayas for some time, and I don’t think you look at these mountains any more. You might have seen them for a little while the first day you arrived and you were finished with them. They are now nothing more than mountains.\nBut Nicholas Roerich spent his lifetime watching and painting the same Himalayas. The eternal and inexhaustible beauty of these mountains continued to enchant him till his last day; he never felt sated. He dedicated his life to painting them, yet his thirst and passion and love for them remained undiminished. He looked at them from hundreds of angles – during the day and night; morning, noon and evening; summer and winter; spring, rains and autumn; sun and moon and stars – and in all their myriad colors and moods. He was busy painting them even at the time of his death. So these mountains will look very different if you see them through the eyes of Roerich. They will tell you a different story if you get acquainted with the works of this man.\nI don’t say that you should see these mountains the way Roerich saw them. No, I don’t say that. And it is impossible for you to see them as this great painter has. But for sure, after knowing him and his works your perspective will change and deepen, you will know these mountains better.\nMany people have loved, but the love of Farhad and Majnu was extraordinary; it was as great as the Himalayas. And it is better to read their story, to be acquainted with their lives; it will be so rewarding. Our love is utterly poor and fleeting; it begins and ends almost simultaneously. And once it is gone it becomes difficult to recall if it ever happened. No sooner the river of our ordinary love appears than it disappears and leaves us high and dry. But there are a few people who continue to love and love passionately till the last breath of their lives. Their love is immense and immeasurable. And it will do you good if you come to know these great lovers; it will help you to understand you own love and the problems of love. Maybe knowing them you become aware of the hidden sources of your own love. It is there in every being, but we smother it and kill it.\nI don’t say that you should imitate Majnu and become like him. No, it is neither possible nor desirable, and an imitation Majnu can only be a caricature. You can have your cut in the pattern of Majnu’s, you can dress like him and wander like a madman shouting, “Laila, Laila.” But that has nothing to do with Majnu. You can act, but you cannot know his essential love. Acting is stupid.\nBut it is possible that the love of Majnu and Farhad will kindle the lamp of your own love, which is as good as extinguished. Maybe his love’s power will catch fire inside you and you will become alive and aware of the source of your own love, which is as inexhaustible. It is in this sense I ask you to know them.\nMany people compose poems and Lyrics, but the Lyrics of Kalidas, Shakespeare, or Rabindranath have something special, something unearthly about them. Listening to Kalidas or Rabindranath you come upon something you have never known before. Perhaps for the first time you glimpse your hidden possibilities.\nFrom tomorrow morning I will speak about Krishna’s philosophy, but I hope you will not make it into your belief and doctrine. I don’t want you to become doctrinaire. Krishna is utterly undoctrinaire. So keep a distance from all theories, doctrines and dogmas. We are trying to understand Krishna for an altogether different purpose. When a glorious and resplendent person like him – who has attained to the fullest flowering of his being – looks at this universe of ours with the eyes of a seer and says something about it, his words have an extraordinary significance for us. His verdict about our world carries tremendous weight, and it is good to be acquainted with it.\nIt is useful to know what a man of such clarity and enlightenment has to say about man and his mind and the ways of his fulfillment. This knowledge, this information he brings us can touch some inner chord of our being and set us on a voyage of exploration. And there is only one worthwhile quest in life, and that is to know who I am or who you are. Then you will not turn into a Krishna-ite, but a traveler on the path to become yourself. And then you will also know that the man who asks Arjuna to die in pursuit of his self-nature is not going to impose any doctrines on you.\nSo I invite you to bring your questions on Krishna’s philosophy from tomorrow onward, and I will go into them all. It is so convenient for me to speak in response to your questions. Then I don’t need to strain my mind, it comes out naturally and flowing like a stream. Otherwise I find it hard to say a thing. My difficulty is that words and ideas are with me only as long as I am speaking to you. When I am not speaking my mind is utterly empty and silent, and resumption of speech becomes so difficult in such a state.\nWhen you ask a question, it serves me as a peg to hang my ideas on. Ordinarily, speaking has become really difficult for me; I have to strain hard to say something. It is becoming increasingly difficult to speak on my own; it puts a great strain on me. Lately many friends have expressed a desire that I should speak independently, without the assistance of your questions. That will be really too much. It will not be long when I will cease to speak independently. Without your questions I don’t know what I should say; words and ideas have left me. But when you bring a question there is no way for me but to respond to It, and so I become articulate. In the absence of your questions I have nothing to say on my own. On my own I am utterly silent. If I speak I speak for you. So bring your questions tomorrow and we will discuss them.\nNow we will sit for meditation.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"8243","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/krishna__the_man_and_his_philosophy/part17/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/krishna__the_man_and_his_philosophy/>Krishna - The Man and His Philosophy</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">17 Don\'t Imitate, Just be Yourself</h1><div class=post-meta>39 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;8243 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Krishna__The_Man_and_His_Philosophy/part17.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part16>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

WITH IT, WE GIVE UP RESISTING IT, RATHER WE TRY TO FLOW WITH YOU. BUT
OUR DIFFICULTY IS THAT YOUR ENERGY IS SO POWERFUL THAT WE CANNOT KEEP
PACE WITH YOU. IN THE BOOK NAMED “THE WAY OF THE WHITE CLOUD” IT IS
SAID, “SOMETIMES I TAKE AWAY THE MAN, THE SUBJECT, BUT DO NOT TAKE AWAY
THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THAT IS OBJECT. SOMETIMES I TAKE AWAY THE
CIRCUMSTANCES, BUT DO NOT TAKE AWAY THE MAN. SOMETIMES I TAKE AWAY BOTH
THE MAN AND THE CIRCUMSTANCES. AND SOMETIMES I TAKE AWAY NEITHER THE MAN
NOR THE CIRCUMSTANCES.” YOU SPOKE ABOUT SHREE ARVIND THIS MORNING. I
AGREE WITH YOU TO A LARGE EXTENT, BUT I HAVE SOME RESERVATIONS IN REGARD
TO YOUR INTERPRETATION OF ARVIND SEEING VISIONS OF KRISHNA. THEN YOU SAY
IT IS MEANINGLESS TO QUOTE SCRIPTURES LIKE THE VEDAS AND THE UPANISHADS
IN SUPPORT OF WHAT ONE HAS TO SAY, BECAUSE IT REFLECTS ONE’S INFERIORITY
COMPLEX. BUT KRISHNA THINKS DIFFERENTLY. HE SAYS TO ARJUNA, “I TEACH YOU
THE KNOWLEDGE, THE WISDOM THAT IS AVAILABLE TO ME FROM ANADIKAL OR TIME
INFINITE.” KRISHNA ASSERTS THAT THE WISDOM HE BRINGS TO THIS EARTH
BELONGS TO INFINITY. BUT BUDDHA CLAIMS THAT HIS WISDOM IS FOUNDED ON
PERSONAL EXPERIENCE, ALTHOUGH HIS CONCEPT OF NIRVANA OR ULTIMATE FREEDOM
IS THE SAME AS IS FORMULATED BY THE FIRST UPANISHAD AND THE BHAGWAD
GEETA. AND DR. RADHAKRISHNAN SAYS THAT BUDDHA’S TEACHINGS ARE NOTHING
BUT EXTENSIONS OF UPANISHADIC PRINCIPLES. UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, IT IS
DIFFICULT TO VOUCH FOR ONE’S AUTHENTICITY. WE FIND OURSELVES IN
DIFFICULTY</p><p>IN REGARD TO YOUR STYLE, THE WAY YOU SPEAK. IT SEEMS YOU OVERWHELM US
WITH YOUR LOGIC, BUT WHEN YOU COME TO FACTS THINGS BECOME EASIER FOR US.
WHEN I CAME HERE I HAD A FEELING THAT COMING IN CONTACT WITH RAJNEESH,
THE ICE OF MY EGO WILL MELT AND DISAPPEAR. AND IT IS TRUE THAT MY EGO
HAS DIMINISHED TO A LARGE EXTENT. PLEASE COMMENT.</p><p><br></p><p>Truth is beginningless.</p><p><br></p><p>The UPANISHAD’S word anadi does not mean old, it means beginningless.
Anadi means that which has no be ginning, the beginningless. It does not
mean ancient as you seem to think. However old and ancient a thing may
be, it has a beginning, but truth has no beginning. And that which
becomes old cannot be truth, because truth is now, in this moment.</p><p><br></p><p>Truth is neither new nor old. What is called a new truth is going to
become old in the future. What is now called old was new sometime in the
past, and what is new today will grow old tomorrow. It is in the nature
of things that everything new becomes old. Truth is neither of the two;
truth is eternal. Or you can say that which is eternal is truth. So
anadi means the eternal, not old and ancient.</p><p><br></p><p>When Krishna says, “I teach the truth that is ANADI,” it does not
mean that he is talking about some old and ancient truth. Krishna means
to say that which is, is truth. He says, “I teach you the eternal
truth.” Those who knew it in the past – if they really knew it – knew
the truth that is eternal. And those who know it today – if they really
know it – know the same eternal truth. And those who will know it in the
future, if they really know, it will be the same truth that is without
beginning and without end. Only falsehood can be old and new; truth
cannot be new or old.</p><p><br></p><p>Of course, there are two ways of saying the truth.</p><p><br></p><p>When Buddha speaks about truth he does not refer to all those who
have known truth in the past, there is no need. When he knows truth on
his own, he need not produce witnesses in his support; that would make
no difference whatsoever. What he knows he knows; witnesses are not
going to add anything to it. Even a thousand names of people who have
known truth will not add one iota to the measure of Buddha’s truth, nor
will they add to the glory and grandeur of truth itself. That is why
Buddha says it directly as he has known it.</p><p><br></p><p>And Buddha does so deliberately; there is a good reason why he does
not mention the names of the old seers. In Buddha’s time these
authoritative names were being misused and they carried a danger with
them. Remember, whenever Buddha said something he always asked his
listeners not to accept it just because somebody else knows and says it.
He always warned his listeners against authority. Throughout his life,
Buddha insisted that unless someone knows truth on his own, he should
not accept it as true on the authority of others – including Buddha.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha is speaking to seekers; his listeners are all seekers of
truth. They are very different from Krishna’s solitary listener, Arjuna.
It is essential for a master to ask his disciples, the seekers of truth
not to accept anything, not to believe just because he says it. If they
believe something as true, they cannot go on the quest for truth. And if
Buddha cites authorities in his support he is laying a precedent for
coming generations to cite him as an authority. So he steers clear of
all previous authorities and says plainly, “I say to you what I have
known, but don’t accept it until you know it for yourselves.”</p><p>But Krishna speaks to an altogether different kind of person, his
listener is not a seeker of truth, he is not on an adventure to find
truth. Arjuna is quite different from the disciples of Buddha. Arjuna is
not seeking truth, he is confused and deluded. The situation of imminent
war has overcome him with weakness and fear. So Krishna is not
interested in unveiling and exposing truth to its roots – he only tells
him what truth is.</p><p><br></p><p>Arjuna has not come to him for truth; he wants Krishna to dispel his
confusion and fear. There fore Krishna says that what he is saying has
been said by many others in the past. If Arjuna happened to be a seeker.
Krishna would certainly ask him to prepare himself for an encounter with
truth. But Arjuna wants only to understand what reality is; he is not
prepared to go in search of truth. He is not in an ashram or a monastery
to learn truth from a master; he is preparing to wage war. And being
confronted with the special conditions of the Mahabharat he is
frightened and depressed. So Krishna, in order to dispel his despondency
and bolster his morale, tells him that what he is saying has the support
of many wise men of the past, that it is the eternal wisdom.</p><p><br></p><p>This kind of teaching has relevance and meaning for Arjuna. If Arjuna
had come to him on his own with a desire to find truth, it would have
been altogether different. But this is not the case. That is why Krishna
explains to him the long tradition of truth so that Arjuna can grasp it
properly.</p><p><br></p><p>There is yet another reason for Krishna’s taking this approach.</p><p><br></p><p>If a person goes to Buddha, he goes as a disciple, as one surrendered
to him. Arjuna is Krishna’s friend, he is not surrendered to him. Much
depends on particular situations and relationships. While Buddha’s
disciples accept what he says, his own wife refuses to take him at his
word. When Buddha returns home after twelve years – during which time he
is widely known as the Buddha, the awakened one, and people from all
over have come to his feet in search of the truth he has known and
proclaimed – his wife Yashodhara, on meeting him, refuses to accept him
as Buddha. She takes him to be the same person who had left his home
stealthily in the dead of night twelve years ago. And she resumes the
argument from that very point. She is as angry as she was the following
morning when she had come to know how her husband had deserted her, and
she vehemently accuses Buddha of betraying her.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha’s wife has her own characteristics. If Buddha tells her
straight off that he is now a Buddha, she would say, “Don’t talk
nonsense, I know who you are. Nobody is a Buddha.” If Buddha has to
communicate with his wife he will do it very differently, because she is
altogether different from his devotees and other seekers. There is a
sweet story related with this episode.</p><p><br></p><p>When Buddha initiated Ananda into sannyas, because he was his elder
cousin, Ananda exacted three promises from him. At the time of
initiation he said to Buddha, “Before I become your disciple, I would
like to have a few assurances from you. Since I am your elder cousin
brother, I am your senior and am in a position to command you to do
certain things. Once I become your disciple, your junior, I will lose
that status; then you will be in a position to command me and I will do
your bidding. Right now you are my younger cousin brother, so give me
three promises.” Buddha asked him what his desires were.</p><p><br></p><p>Ananda said, “Firstly, I will always be with you from morning to
morning; you will never send me away from you on an errand. Secondly, if
I bring any visitors to you – even at odd hours of the night</p><p>– you will never say no to them. And you will answer every question I
will put to you at any time and place. And thirdly, I will attend, if I
want to, even your very private and confidential discussions with your
visitors.” Being the younger brother, Buddha not only accepted Ananda’s
conditions, he honored them throughout his life. He never felt any
difficulty about it.</p><p><br></p><p>But when he returned to his home town after twelve years and was
going to visit his wife, Yashodhara, these promises given to Ananda
years ago came in the way. Ananda, as usual, wanted to be with him
during his meeting with his wife, but for the first time Buddha felt
embarrassed. He said to Ananda, “Just think, I am going to visit her
after twelve long years. And for her I am not Buddha, but the same old
Gautam Siddhartha, her husband who left her in the dead of night without
informing her. And you know she is a proud woman and she will take
offense if you come with me; she will think it is a strategy to prevent
her from expressing all her bottled-up resentment and frustration.
sorrow and suffering. I am aware of my promise, but I beg of you not to
insist on it for once.”</p><p><br></p><p>This is a very sensitive and delicate moment and Buddha’s response to
it is so human and beautiful. When Ananda reminds him that he has
transcended all associations and attachments – no one is now a wife or a
son to him – Buddha tells him, “This is quite true, Ananda, as far as I
am concerned. But for Yashodhara I am her husband, and it is not in my
hands to undo it.”</p><p><br></p><p>Ananda keeps out of Buddha’s way. ’When Buddha meets Yashodhara the
expected happens. She bursts out crying; all the pent-up anger and pain
and agony she has silently suffered for twelve years comes out in a
torrent. Her outburst is quite justifiable. Buddha listens to her very
silently. When she quiets down and wipes away her tears, Buddha says to
her very gently, “Yashodhara, look at me attentively. I am not the same
person who had left you twelve years back. I don’t come back to you as
your husband, the husband is no more. I am altogether different. You
talked so long to the departed one; now you can talk to me.”</p><p><br></p><p>The relationship between Krishna and Arjuna is radically different;
they are friends. They have played and gossiped together as intimate
pals. If Krishna tells him only this much, “I speak about the truth that
I have known,” Arjuna will retort, “I know you and your truth.” So he
has to say, “What I say is the same truth that has been said by many
other seers. Don’t take it amiss because it comes to you from a friend.
What I say is really significant.”</p><p><br></p><p>The GEETA is the product of a particular situation; and this has to
be borne in mind, otherwise there is much room for misunderstanding.
Buddha’s situation is different from Krishna’s. He can afford to say,
“What I say is truth; I am not concerned with what others say about it.
And I also urge you not to accept it on my authority. You need to come
to it on your own.” And it is not an egoist’s statement. An egoist would
insist on being accepted as an authority. Buddha is simply stating his
individual experience to stimulate the thirst for truth in his
listeners. He tells them again not to take it as a belief, but go on
their own search for truth. But he is also clear that what he says is
his own experience. This is simply a state, ment of fact.</p><p><br></p><p>We are aware that what Buddha says has been said by others too. We
know that the Vedas and UPANISHADS have already said what Buddha says.
But why doesn’t Buddha say so? There are reasons for it, and the reasons
are inherent in the conditions of Buddha’s time. By the time of Buddha,
the tradition of the Vedas and UPANISHADS had completely degenerated and
decayed,</p><p>it was really corrupt and rotten. To say a word in favor of these old
scriptures was tantamount to providing support to a decadent and rotting
tradition. Knowing well that the Vedas and the UPANISHADS contained the
same truth, Buddha could not take their support. Because it was with
their support that a monster of falsehoods, superstitions and crass
hypocrisy was stalking the land, mercilessly exploiting and oppressing
the people. That is why he kept quiet about them.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not that Buddha is not aware that the Vedas and UPANISHADS
contain the truth. But it often happens in history that when a new
Buddha comes he has to fight and uproot many old truths, because being
old they get so badly mixed up with falsehoods that to support them
would automatically strengthen those lies.</p><p><br></p><p>Krishna did not have to face such a situation. In his time the
tradition of the Vedas and the UPANISHADS was very much alive. It was
really at the height of its glory, absolutely unpolluted and pure. For
this very reason we say Krishna’s Geeta is the quintessence of the Vedas
and the UPANISHADS. In fact, we can say Krishna himself is the
embodiment of the great culture which had come out of these scriptures.
Krishna reflects all that is essential and basic to that culture; he
comes at a time when the Vedic civilization was at its zenith. Buddha
comes when it had touched its nadir. It was the same culture, but Buddha
had to witness its utter decadence and degradation, when the brahmins
had ceased to be knowers of truth and instead were busy exploiting
people in the name of God and religion. Every conceivable filth and
ugliness, corruption and depravity had entered this culture, which now
had nothing to do with religion.</p><p><br></p><p>Krishna represents the summit of UPANISHADIC teachings. In his times
the UPANISHADS have touched the pinnacle of attainment and splendor. The
light of knowledge emanating from them is spreading in all directions,
and their perfume is everywhere in the air. The UPANISHADS are not a
dead thing, they are fully alive and youthful and their music can be
heard even in the bushes and shrubs of the land. So when Krishna talks
about them, he is not talking about something old and dead; he is
talking about something which is in the prime of its youth.</p><p><br></p><p>But by the time Buddha comes, twenty-five hundred years after
Krishna, the whole tradition is dying and rotting, only its corpse is
Lying before him. Clearly, Buddha cannot invoke their support. It is not
out of any arrogance that he declares his truth on his own.</p><p><br></p><p>At the same time there is nothing egoistic about Krishna when he
seeks the support of the old seers and their sayings.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2</p><p><br></p><p>QUESTIONER: KRISHNA, IN CHAPTER TEN OF THE GEETA DESCRIBES HIMSELF TO
BE THE GANGES AMONG THE RIVERS, THE SPRING AMONG THE SEASONS, THE LION
AMONG THE BEASTS, THE GARUDA OR EAGLE AMONG THE BIRDS, THE EIRAWAT AMONG
THE ELEPHANTS, THE KAMDHENU AMONG THE COWS, VASUKI AMONG THE SNAKES, AND
SO ON. DOES IT MEAN THAT HE IS TRYING TO DECLARE HIMSELF TO BE THE BEST
AND THE GREATEST IN ALL CREATION? DOES IT ALSO MEAN THAT HE REFUSES TO
REPRESENT ALL THAT IS LOWLY AND BASE? WHY DOES HE EXCLUDE THE MEANEST OF
US ALL? AND WHERE DOES THE MEANEST BELONG?</p><p><br></p><p>It is a significant question. And there are two beautiful aspects to
it.</p><p>Firstly, Krishna declares himself to be the best among all things –
of all the seasons he is the spring, of all the cows he is the kamdhenu,
of all the elephants he is the eirawat. And secondly – and this is more
significant – he finds his peers even among the lowliest of creatures
like cows and horses. Both things should be taken together. While he
declares himself to be the best among different classes of creatures, he
does not distinguish between one class and another. Even when he claims
to be the eirawat among elephants, he remains nonetheless an elephant.
Even when he claims to be the best among the cows he remains a cow.
Similarly he is quite at home among snakes and reptiles. He does not
exclude the meanest categories as you think. He chooses to be the best
even among the meanest creatures of this universe. And there is a
reason. But why does he declare him self to be the best and the greatest
among us all?</p><p><br></p><p>On the surface it seems to us to be an egoistic declaration, because
we are so much involved with our egos that everything we see appears
egoistic. But if we go deep into it we will know what a great message is
enshrined in Krishna’s declaration. When he says that he is the eirawat
among the elephants, he means to say every elephant is destined to be an
eirawat, and if one fails to be eirawat he fails to actualize his best
and highest potential. Similarly every season has the potential to grow
into a spring, and if one fails to attain to the highest in its nature,
it fails its nature. And if a cow fails to be the kamdhenu, it means she
has gone astray from her nature. In all these declarations, Krishna says
only one thing: that he is the culmination, the perfection of nature in
everything. Whoever and whatever attains to the sublime reflects
godliness. This is the central message of this declaration. Please
understand its deeper significance.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not that an elephant who does not become the eirawat is not a
Krishna, he too is a Krishna, but a backward Krishna; he has failed to
be the eirawat which is his potential. Krishna says he reflects the
innate potentiality of each being come to its completion, that each
being can grow into Krishnahood, god-hood. Krishna symbolizes the
actualized form at its best, the highest of each one’s possibility.
Every being, every thing is capable of attaining to Krishna-hood. And if
one fails to realize himself fully, it simply meanS that he has betrayed
his innate nature, he has deviated from it. There is not even a trace of
egoism in Krishna’s declaration. This is his way of saying that one
cannot attain to godliness unless he becomes like the lion among
animals, like the spring among the seasons, like the Ganges among the
rivers. One comes to God only when one attains to one’s own fullest
flowering, not otherwise.</p><p><br></p><p>By way of these illustrations Krishna persuades Arjuna that if he
flowers to the maximum as a warrior – which is his innate nature – he
will be. come a Krishna in his own right. Had Krishna been born two
thousand years later he would have said, “I am Arjuna among the
warrior.”</p><p><br></p><p>When Krishna declares his being, he is not claiming greatness. To
claim greatness he need not compare himself with beasts and birds,
snakes and reptiles. Claims to greatness can be made directly, but
Krishna really does not claim any greatness for himself. He Is speaking
about a law of growth, a universal law which is that when you draw out
the best in you, when you actualize your highest potential you become
God.</p><p><br></p><p>One of the Sanskrit names of God Is Ishwar, which Is derived from
aishwarya, meaning affluence. It means when you attain to the peak of
affluence as a being, you become God. But we never pay attention to this
aspect of godliness, which is affluence in every respect. So to be the
lion among the animals, the kamdhenu among the cows, and the spring
among the seasons is to attain to godliness,</p><p>to God. When there is no difference whatsoever between your
potentiality and actuality, you become God. When the highest possibility
of your life is actualized you attain to Godhood.</p><p><br></p><p>If there is a distance between your potential and actual states of
being, it means you are yet on the way to your destiny. And godliness is
everybody’s destiny; it is really everyone’s birthright. When that which
is hidden in you becomes manifest, you are God. Right now you are part
hidden and part manifest, you are on the way to flowering. You have yet
to burst into a full spring, you have yet to become God. If Krishna
happens to visit our garden here and says that he is the most blossomed
one among all the flowers of this garden, what does he mean by it? He
means to say that other flowers have the potential to achieve this
flowering, and they are on the way to it.</p><p><br></p><p>It is right that Krishna does not relate himself with flowers yet
hidden in their buds or in their seeds. He connects himself only with
those that have fully flowered. And there is a reason for it. He is
speaking to Arjuna who is depressed and confused, and he is not only
trying to revive him but also to inspire him to blossom fully as a
warrior, to actualize his potential as a warrior. Then alone, Krishna
says, can he attain to God, to the utmost peak.</p><p><br></p><p>Here Krishna is having to play a double role. Because Arjuna is his
friend, he cannot be too hard with him. He has to speak as a friend but
all the time he is aware that he has to help Arjuna to come to the same
flowering of being which he embodies in himself. Therefore, from time to
time he gives glimpses of his own flowering, of his own fullness, so
that these glimpses gently seep into Arjuna’s awareness.</p><p><br></p><p>Krishna will be of no use to Arjuna if he re mains only his friend,
but if he reveals his godliness indiscriminately, Arjuna may be so
frightened that he runs away. So all the time he has to strike a balance
between the two roles he is playing. While he continues to be Arjuna’s
friend he also declares his godliness from time to time. Whenever he
finds Arjuna is relaxed, he declares his godliness. And when Arjuna is
assailed with doubt and confusion he returns to his friendly approach.
His task is very delicate, and very few Buddhas have had to deal with
such a situation as Krishna faces in the war of the Mahabharat.</p><p><br></p><p>Bud&amp;a does not have to deal with such a delicate situation. He
knows his people clearly; he knows who is who and what they want. His
people have come to sit at his feet to learn truth from him, so
communication with them is easy and straight. Mahavira too, has no such
difficulties with his listeners. Krishna’s difficulty with Arjuna is
real, he has to play a double role.</p><p><br></p><p>It is really difficult to teach a friend, to be his teacher It is
difficult even to be an advisor to an intimate friend. If you try he
will say, “Shut up, don’t show off your wisdom.” Arjuna can say to
Krishna, “Keep your sage advices to yourself, I know how much you know,
since we have grown together from child. hood.” Arjuna can run away in
such a situation. So Krishna on the one hand placates him with phrases
like “O great warrior,” and on the other he tells him “You are an
ignoramus, you don’t know the reality.”</p><p><br></p><p>If you bear in mind this aspect of the GEETA, you will have no
difficulty understanding it. Question 3</p><p>QUESTIONER: THERE ARE TWO SIDES TO THE LIFE OF EVERY GREAT MAN. WHILE
ONE SIDE IS PERSONAL AND PRIVATE, THE OTHER IS OPEN, PUBLIC. THESE FEW
DAYS THAT YOU HAVE BEEN TALKING TO US ABOUT KRISHNA, WE HAVE BEEN HELPED
TO UNDERSTAND SOME FEATURES OF HIS LIFE WHICH ARE SUCH THAT IF WE TRY TO
IMITATE HIM TODAY WE WILL AT ONCE BE OSTRACIZED BY THE SOCIETY. WE
CANNOT PLAY PRANKS WITH OUR GIRLFRIENDS IN THE STREETS; WE CANNOT RUN
AWAY WITH THEIR CLOTHES WHILE THEY ARE BATHING IN A SWIMMING POOL; WE
CANNOT DANCE WITH OUR RADHAS AS KRISHNA DANCES WITH HIS RADHA WHO IS HIS
GIRLFRIEND, NOT HIS WIFE – EVEN IF WE ARE DEEP IN LOVE WITH THEM. BUT
ANOTHER SIDE OF KRISHNA’S LIFE IS ABOVE-BOARD. HIS SAYINGS HAVE
TREMENDOUS RELEVANCE FOR ALL TIMES – PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE. AND IT IS
IN THIS CONTEXT THAT WE REQUEST YOU TO SHED LIGHT ON HIS PHILOSOPHY OF
LIFE, ON HIS DISCIPLINE OF WORK, KNOWLEDGE AND NON-ATTACHMENT, AND HIS
ART OF LIVING, SO THAT WE CAN EMULATE HIM IN OUR DAY TO DAY LIFE.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t think that only in the present it is difficult to play the role
of Krishna; it was difficult in Krishna’s own times. Otherwise there
would have been not only one, but any number of Krishnas. And if it
seems difficult for you today to become Krishna-like, know that it would
have been as difficult in Krishna’s time if you were his contemporaries.
And for Krishna it would be as easy to be a Krishna today – if he were
born again – as it was in his own days. But this illusion stems from our
idea and habit of following and imitating others in every way. In fact,
imitation is the beginning of all our problems.</p><p><br></p><p>You could never have imitated Krishna if you lived in his days, nor
can you imitate him now. It is impossible. And if you do, you are right
in saying that you will end up in a mess.</p><p><br></p><p>I have been talking on Krishna’s life and philosophy not so that you
will make him your ideal and imitate him. Nothing is farther from me
than the idea of imitation. If we can understand Krishna’s life, it will
help us to understand our own life in its right perspective. If we fully
unfold and understand Krishna’s life, which is vast and
multidimensional, it will enable us to unfold our own life and know it.
But you will never understand Krishna if you think in terms of imitating
him.</p><p><br></p><p>If we imitate someone or other, we will never understand him because
of that. And we will never understand our own life. In fact, the reason
we want to imitate someone is that we don’t want to take the trouble of
understanding ourselves. It is convenient to live in somebody else’s
shadow and imitate him; it is a way to escape the arduous task of
understanding ourselves. Understanding begins when someone ceases to
imitate others, to be like others, when he wants to know directly who he
is and what he can be.</p><p><br></p><p>The life of one who has achieved his full unfoldment helps to
understand one’s own life. It doesn’t mean that one becomes like him,
becomes his carbon copy. To become like others is neither possible nor
desirable. Everyone is different and will remain different.</p><p><br></p><p>If you think in terms of imitation when we are discussing Krishna –
and it seems from your question that you do think in such terms – then
you will never understand Krishna. Never mind Krishna, you will never
understand yourselves.</p><p>Secondly I would like to emphasize that although Krishna’s
philosophy, his vision of truth is significant and useful, it is not to
be imitated, followed. When I ask you not to imitate his life which is
so rich and dynamic, how can I ask you to imitate his ideas and
thoughts, even his truth expressed in words? No, you have only to
understand them, not follow and imitate them.</p><p><br></p><p>Of course as you understand Krishna your own understanding and
intelligence will grow and deepen; it will enrich you in your own way,
No ideas, no thoughts, no principles will help you; only understanding
will. Understanding is the key, the master key.</p><p><br></p><p>It is unfortunate that imitation has become the hallmark of our life;
we imitate from the cradle to the grave. We imitate others’ ways of
living; we imitate their ideas and thoughts. We are nothing more than
imitators in every aspect of life.</p><p><br></p><p>Before I go into Krishna’s philosophy, it is necessary to warn you
against imitation and following. Don’t follow anyone, not even Krishna.
I say so not because it is not possible today to play pranks on your
girlfriends or to run away with their clothes or to dance with them in
the streets, Everything is possible, there is no difficulty in it. And
if dancing with girlfriends is difficult today, it was difficult in
Krishna’s time too. Playing a flute was as difficult then as it is now.
There is no basic difference between old and new times; the differences
are minor. So it is not because of changed times that I ask you not to
imitate. Imitation itself is wrong, utterly wrong, and it is always
wrong. Imitation is suicidal. If you want to kill yourself, then only is
imitation okay.</p><p><br></p><p>Krishna never imitates anyone. Buddha does not follow others. Can you
name a person whom Krishna or Buddha or Christ ever imitated? It is
ironic that we imitate those who never imitated others. It is so absurd.
So the first thing to know about men like Krishna is that they never
follow and imitate others, howsoever great the others may be. Persons
like Krishna, Buddha, and Christ, are the exquisite flowerings of
individuality; they are not carbon copies of others.</p><p><br></p><p>But we all try to imitate others. And imitation is dangerous. Playing
the flute or loving a Radha is not so dangerous. Even today one does not
refrain from falling in love with somebody else’s wife. It happens
almost every day. The husband is afraid of his wife, the wife is afraid
of her husband, and yet extra marital relations happen everywhere. And
it is no thing new, it has always been so. As long as husbands and wives
ate there, their fear of each other will be there. And to be without
husbands and wives is equally frightening. Man as he is is in fear. and
this fear permeates his whole life.</p><p><br></p><p>Let us first understand this fear, and then we will go into the
matter of truth and reality. You are not afraid of imitating Krishna
because of public opinion. Fear of imitation is more basic, and I would
like to go into it before I take up your question on philosophy and
truth. I did not go into Krishna’s personal life on my own, but because
you had asked questions about it. And as you have raised the question of
the fear of imitating Krishna, I will deal with it first and then take
up the rest of the question.</p><p><br></p><p>The basic fear of imitation is quite different. Imitation in itself
is unnatural and ugly and wrong. In this whole world no two persons are
alike, the same; they cannot be. Each person is different, unique and
incomparable. There is no way to compare you with any other person in
the whole world. You are like you; you are you. Never a person like you
has happened in the long past of mankind, and never one like you is
going to happen again in the future. God is a creator; he is creativity
itself; he</p><p>is always original, and whatever he creates is original. He never
makes a carbon copy, he has no use for carbon papers in the whole
process of creation. He never repeats; you can’t accuse him of
repetition. And therefore, if you deny your individuality and try to
follow and be like somebody else, you are violating the fundamental law
of life. Imitation is a crime against God. He made you an individual and
you are trying to be somebody’s copy. He gave you individuality, and you
are trying to impose somebody else’s personality on yourself, an alien
personality. This is the basic fear and fundamental problem of our
life.</p><p><br></p><p>Up to now all religions of the world have taught imitation. Parents
and teachers all over the world exhort young men and women from their
early childhood to be like others, they never ask them to be like
themselves, to be themselves. They insist to you, “Be like Krishna,
Christ or Buddha, but never commit the mistake of being like yourself.”
Why? How is it that all educational institutions in the world teach you
to be imitators and they never ask you to be yourself?</p><p><br></p><p>There are good reasons for it. The most important reason is that if
everyone becomes himself, he will be a free individual, a rebel – not a
conformist, a camp follower. He will be a danger to the institutions of
parents, teachers, priests, managers of society, and to society itself.
Every society is afraid of non-conformists and rebels. It honors the
conformists, the yes-sayers. That is why everybody, from the president
down to the parents pressures children, with one voice, to be followers,
imitators. Otherwise they can’t be certain who will turn into what.</p><p><br></p><p>There is no danger if you become like Rama, because everything about
Rama is known, what he does and what he does not do. He is predictable.
And if you become another Rama you will be as predictable, and society
will know what you are going to do. And if you deviate from the outlined
path they will declare you an outlaw and punish you.</p><p><br></p><p>If everyone is allowed to be himself, then it will be difficult to
say what is right and what is wrong, what is virtue and what is sin.
Therefore the society wants you to fit into its well-defined patterns
and clear-cut molds. It does not care if by this effort your
individuality is destroyed, your life is ruined, and your soul is
impoverished. Its sole concern is to turn men into machines so that the
status quo is maintained at any cost.</p><p><br></p><p>It seems man lives for society, society does not exist for man. The
individual has no importance; he is just a cog in the social machine. It
seems education is not meant for man; on the contrary, man is meant for
education, for being educated the way the society wants. It seems tenets
and doctrines are not made to serve man; on the contrary, man is born in
the service of tenets and doctrines. It seems religion is not for man;
man is for religion. It is ironic that man is not an end unto himself,
he is just a means. And things that are meant to be means have become
ends unto themselves. This is the danger. This is the curse of
imitation, that man has been reduced into a thing, a non-entity.</p><p><br></p><p>Imitation is destructive, it kills the individual. And this danger is
inner, spiritual; it is not circumstantial. It is a kind of slow
poisoning. Whether you imitate Krishna or Buddha, it makes no
difference; all imitation is suicidal.</p><p><br></p><p>There is no mold, no pattern, no type into which man can be fitted.
Every person is a unique and different individual, and he is meant to be
him self. This is his freedom, his birthright.</p><p>So when I am speaking to you about Krishna, let no one think even
mistakenly that I want you to be like Krishna. I am against all
following, all imitation, all comparisons. Every suffering that comes to
man from external sources is secondary; the suffering that imitation and
following brings in its wake is real and colossal. You cannot become
like Krishna without being dead. And it is only dead people who are
afraid – afraid of everything. You are afraid of being beaten by the
public if you dance and sing like Krishna. This is the fear of the dead,
the imitator. A man who is fully alive is himself; he does not imitate.
The more one is alive the more he is himself. And an alive man, a real
individual is not afraid of society; on the contrary, the society is
afraid of him. And that is why the society condemns him.</p><p><br></p><p>It is amusing that every society slanders and condemns the free
individual, who is the only alive person – but this is not the whole
story. The free individual is condemned in the beginning and worshipped
in the end. It has always been the case. If a fully alive man remains
alive to the end, he is destined to be condemned first and worshipped
and adored later. And a really free person is not afraid of
condemnation, ostracism, even crucifixion.</p><p><br></p><p>Krishna is one of those rare beings in man’s history who choose to be
themselves. He is not concerned about what you say about him. Do you
think he was accepted as Bhagwan or God in his own times? No, he was
accused and condemned in every way. And even today you will not spare
him unless you shut your eyes to many episodes of his life.</p><p><br></p><p>Do you know how Jesus was crucified? He was condemned as a
disreputable and dangerous person. When he was hanged he was not alone:
he was placed between two thieves who were going to suffer the same
fate. This was a declaration that Jesus was no better than the
criminals. It is interesting that not only the people of Jerusalem – who
had gathered in thousands to witness his crucifixion – had ridiculed
him. Even one of the thieves on the cross made a joke at Jesus’ expense.
He is reported to have said, “Since you and I are going to die together,
we are kith and kin. So please save a place for me too in your father’s
kingdom when I reach there.” Even a thief mocks Jesus and his kingdom of
God. Not only his persecutors, not only the public of Jerusalem – even a
criminal who was going to be hanged for theft thought Jesus was a
good-for-nothing vagabond. He thought himself better because while he
had done something to deserve punishment Jesus was going to be hanged
for nothing.</p><p><br></p><p>The society in which Krishna or Christ, Mahavira or Buddha are born
does not accept them as Bhagwans, incarnations and messiahs. At first it
condemns them, calls them names, mocks them, persecutes them. But they
are brave people and cannot be intimidated. They bear the insults and
humiliations with a smile of compassion on their faces. So how long can
you go on? You will feel embarrassed, conquered by their love, their
forbearance and com passion. And you begin to honor and worship them.
But they take your worship with the same detachment and equanimity with
which they take your insults and curses, because really nothing affects
them – neither fame nor infamy. And then the society hails them as
God-incarnates.</p><p><br></p><p>I attach importance to a discussion of Krishna’s life not because I
want you to emulate him, but because he is the most beautiful and rare
example of a multidimensional person. And if his treasures are laid
before you they will help you uncover your own hidden treasures. This
much importance Krishna has for me, nothing more. And remember,
Krishna’s treasures are Krishna’s, and your treasures will be your own.
And no one can say your treasures will not be even richer than
Krishna’s.</p><p>I want to remind you again that what happened to Krishna can happen
to each one of you, and this awareness is enough. This whole discussion
is just meant for this remembrance that you all are heirs to
godliness.</p><p><br></p><p>You want to know about Krishna’s philosophy of life. This desire for
a life philosophy stems from the same source; you want something
ready-made, an ideology, a doctrine, a tenet which you can impose
conveniently on yourself and be finished with it. I will take up his
philosophy tomorrow, but for a different purpose. I want you just to
understand your own life with its help. I don’t want you to accept and
follow Krishna’s views and ideas. People like Krishna look at life with
extraordinary eyes; their perception is rare. It penetrates the
innermost depth of life, and it will be a great gift if for a while we
can look at life through the eyes of Krishna. That will go a long way to
change and deepen our own perception, our own perspective of life.</p><p>You are here in Manali, in the Himalayas, surrounded by beautiful
hills and majestic mountains. But you can see only that much beauty in
these mountains as your eyes, your perception, your perspective are
capable of. Nicholas Roerich, the renowned painter, happened to live
here for a long time. If you go and see his paintings, they will give
you quite a different perspective of the same mountains; you will see
them with the eyes of Roerich. He came to these mountains from distant
Russia at a time when there were no roads as there are today to connect
the Himalayas with the rest of the world. And once he saw the Himalayas
he made them his lifelong home; he never left again. These very
mountains before you now had possessed Roerich, enchanted him.</p><p>You have been in the Himalayas for some time, and I don’t think you
look at these mountains any more. You might have seen them for a little
while the first day you arrived and you were finished with them. They
are now nothing more than mountains.</p><p><br></p><p>But Nicholas Roerich spent his lifetime watching and painting the
same Himalayas. The eternal and inexhaustible beauty of these mountains
continued to enchant him till his last day; he never felt sated. He
dedicated his life to painting them, yet his thirst and passion and love
for them remained undiminished. He looked at them from hundreds of
angles – during the day and night; morning, noon and evening; summer and
winter; spring, rains and autumn; sun and moon and stars – and in all
their myriad colors and moods. He was busy painting them even at the
time of his death. So these mountains will look very different if you
see them through the eyes of Roerich. They will tell you a different
story if you get acquainted with the works of this man.</p><p>I don’t say that you should see these mountains the way Roerich saw
them. No, I don’t say that. And it is impossible for you to see them as
this great painter has. But for sure, after knowing him and his works
your perspective will change and deepen, you will know these mountains
better.</p><p><br></p><p>Many people have loved, but the love of Farhad and Majnu was
extraordinary; it was as great as the Himalayas. And it is better to
read their story, to be acquainted with their lives; it will be so
rewarding. Our love is utterly poor and fleeting; it begins and ends
almost simultaneously. And once it is gone it becomes difficult to
recall if it ever happened. No sooner the river of our ordinary love
appears than it disappears and leaves us high and dry. But there are a
few people who continue to love and love passionately till the last
breath of their lives. Their love is immense and immeasurable. And it
will do you good if you come to know these great lovers; it will help
you to understand you own love and the problems of love. Maybe knowing
them you become aware of the hidden sources of your own love. It is
there in every being, but we smother it and kill it.</p><p>I don’t say that you should imitate Majnu and become like him. No, it
is neither possible nor desirable, and an imitation Majnu can only be a
caricature. You can have your cut in the pattern of Majnu’s, you can
dress like him and wander like a madman shouting, “Laila, Laila.” But
that has nothing to do with Majnu. You can act, but you cannot know his
essential love. Acting is stupid.</p><p><br></p><p>But it is possible that the love of Majnu and Farhad will kindle the
lamp of your own love, which is as good as extinguished. Maybe his
love’s power will catch fire inside you and you will become alive and
aware of the source of your own love, which is as inexhaustible. It is
in this sense I ask you to know them.</p><p><br></p><p>Many people compose poems and Lyrics, but the Lyrics of Kalidas,
Shakespeare, or Rabindranath have something special, something unearthly
about them. Listening to Kalidas or Rabindranath you come upon something
you have never known before. Perhaps for the first time you glimpse your
hidden possibilities.</p><p><br></p><p>From tomorrow morning I will speak about Krishna’s philosophy, but I
hope you will not make it into your belief and doctrine. I don’t want
you to become doctrinaire. Krishna is utterly undoctrinaire. So keep a
distance from all theories, doctrines and dogmas. We are trying to
understand Krishna for an altogether different purpose. When a glorious
and resplendent person like him – who has attained to the fullest
flowering of his being – looks at this universe of ours with the eyes of
a seer and says something about it, his words have an extraordinary
significance for us. His verdict about our world carries tremendous
weight, and it is good to be acquainted with it.</p><p><br></p><p>It is useful to know what a man of such clarity and enlightenment has
to say about man and his mind and the ways of his fulfillment. This
knowledge, this information he brings us can touch some inner chord of
our being and set us on a voyage of exploration. And there is only one
worthwhile quest in life, and that is to know who I am or who you are.
Then you will not turn into a Krishna-ite, but a traveler on the path to
become yourself. And then you will also know that the man who asks
Arjuna to die in pursuit of his self-nature is not going to impose any
doctrines on you.</p><p><br></p><p>So I invite you to bring your questions on Krishna’s philosophy from
tomorrow onward, and I will go into them all. It is so convenient for me
to speak in response to your questions. Then I don’t need to strain my
mind, it comes out naturally and flowing like a stream. Otherwise I find
it hard to say a thing. My difficulty is that words and ideas are with
me only as long as I am speaking to you. When I am not speaking my mind
is utterly empty and silent, and resumption of speech becomes so
difficult in such a state.</p><p><br></p><p>When you ask a question, it serves me as a peg to hang my ideas on.
Ordinarily, speaking has become really difficult for me; I have to
strain hard to say something. It is becoming increasingly difficult to
speak on my own; it puts a great strain on me. Lately many friends have
expressed a desire that I should speak independently, without the
assistance of your questions. That will be really too much. It will not
be long when I will cease to speak independently. Without your questions
I don’t know what I should say; words and ideas have left me. But when
you bring a question there is no way for me but to respond to It, and so
I become articulate. In the absence of your questions I have nothing to
say on my own. On my own I am utterly silent. If I speak I speak for
you. So bring your questions tomorrow and we will discuss them.</p><p><br></p><p>Now we will sit for meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part16>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

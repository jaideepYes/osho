PLEASE EXPLAIN THE ANOMALY.\nThe cross is the symbol of death. It is okay as an emblem of the grave, but it is dangerous to accept it as a symbol of life. But many so-called religious people have treated human life and body as no more than a grave, and it is going to result in a disaster.\nA man bearing a crucifix on his breast declares that life is not acceptable to him; he is worshipping death really. For him life is a curse, not a blessing. Christianity – I don’t mean Jesus – believes that man is born in sin, that life is the original sin. According to them, what we think of as life is not God’s gift, but a form of punishment inflicted on man.\nThis kind of thinking is essentially masochistic, pessimistic, morbid. Standing near a rosebush a pessimist takes note of every thorn, but he ignores the flowers altogether. Looking at day and night, a pessimist sees two dark nights sandwiching a short day instead of seeing two bright days enclosing a brief dark night. Such a mind gathers together all the hurt and pain of life and completely forgets its delights and pleasures.\nIn fact, paying too much attention to the miseries of life is the sign of a diseased mind, a neurotic and deranged mind. Of course a philosophy of life that affirms and emphasizes sorrow and suffering is bound to be negative and nihilistic. And this is what the cross represents.\nHad he not been crucified, Jesus would have never made such a powerful impact on the world. In all probability the world would have forgotten him. His crucifixion became the foundation of Christianity.\nToday nearly a billion people all over the world are within the fold of Christianity. I don’t take this to be the triumph of Christ, it is undoubtedly the victory of the cross. Jesus hanging on the cross became a great attraction for our miserable and diseased minds. Our lives are virtually on the cross; we are ridden with anxiety, sorrow and suffering. We are a people who collect only hurt and pain, as some people collect used stamps. We all have our stockpiles of miseries; we don’t have any remembrance of having any happy moments in life.\nKrishna is absolutely the opposite type of individual, and his flute as a symbol is just the opposite of the cross. There is no sense in putting a flute on a grave; it needs throbbing lips and supple fingers to play it. It needs a singing and dancing heart, a soul brimming with joy and bliss to hold it. And I think it is time man makes a clear choice between the cross of Jesus and the flute of Krishna.\nIt is not that life is without its hurts and pains; it cannot be. But if a person brings his focus only to the hurt and pain and goes on accumulating them, he will soon cease to meet with any happy moments in life. It is not that there is no happiness in life; it has its fair share of happiness too. And if someone trains his attention on happiness alone and goes on gathering it, he will eventually cease to come across painful moments in life.\nLife consists of both pleasure and pain, happiness and misery. And it depends on us what we choose to see and take. My own understanding is that if someone sees rightly and loves rose flowers, then soon the thorns on the rosebush will disappear from his sight. Eyes attuned to the beauty and fragrance of the flower don’t take notice of the thorns. Not that the thorns disappear from the bush; they become part and parcel of the grandeur of the roses, and one sees them as something protecting the roses. They are really to protect the flowers, not to hurt anyone.\nBut if someone sees only thorns he will miss the flowers. He will say, “How can there be any flowers in the midst of so many piercing thorns and thistles?” He cannot even think of flowers where thorns abound. For him thorns become the truth and flowers disappear like dreams. But for a lover of flowers, thorns become illusory and flowers the truth.\nIt depends on man, what he chooses; he is free to choose. There is a saying of Sartre’s which is strange but close to truth. He says, “Man is condemned to be free.” It seems freedom is an imposition on us, inflicted on us. It seems we can choose every thing except freedom – because we are free to choose or not to choose it. Never had anyone described freedom as something inflicted on man.\nMan is free, and this freedom affirms his being God. But he can choose anything – even not being God. Similarly, he is free to choose pain and misery. Life will be pure suffering for one who makes suffering his choice. We become that which we choose to become. In fact, we see what we want to see; we find what we want to find; we receive what we ask for. So if you seek suffering you are going to have it, without fail.\nThe irony is that if someone opts for suffering he does not suffer alone, he makes many others suffer with him. And this is where immorality comes into being. Unhappiness is a contagious disease: a single unhappy person can be the cause of the unhappiness of thousands. It is impossible that an unhappy man can make another happy. How can he give happiness to another when he refuses to take it for himself. Remember, we can share with others only that which we have, not what we don’t have.\nOne who has turned his life into a bundle of hurts and wounds is going to be the cause of much suffering in the lives of many people around him. Since suffering has become his life’s breath, wherever he goes he will carry the germs of suffering with him. So an unhappy man does not suffer alone, he shares his sorrow with everybody he comes in contact with. Walking or sitting, speaking or silent, active or inactive, he emits and transmits the vibes of unhappiness like nuclear fallout all around him. An unhappy person really adds to the unhappiness of the whole world.\nRemember, when you choose unhappiness, you are not choosing it for yourself alone, but for the whole world as such.\nAs I said, it is man’s preference for pain and suffering which the cross symbolizes. And that has led him to the doorstep of war – a war that is going to be a total war. For the first time, mankind is on the brink of committing global suicide. But he has asked for it by opting for misery.\nWe know very well that sometimes individuals driven up the wall commit suicide in despair. But for the first time a situation for collective suicide has arisen, when the whole of mankind has become so miserable that it is going to commit global hara-kiri.\nIt seems war has become our way of life, and the mounting number of wars are nothing but our mounting steps to collective death and destruction. And this destruction is the cumulative effect of mankind’s choice of suffering. Really, war is of our own choosing, it does not descend out of the blue.\nAnd when we court suffering religiously, when we accept it as something religious, then no thing remains to be chosen irreligiously. When we turn sorrow into a religion, then there is nothing like irreligion on the earth. Sorrow is really enshrined when it is made part of religion.\nA whole milieu of unhappiness and misery was created around the cross. I don’t say it was created around Jesus, because Jesus is not necessarily connected with the cross; he could very well do without the cross. The fact is, that Christianity was created not by Jesus, but by the people who crucified him.\nI always say Christianity was not founded by Jesus; its real founders were those Jewish theologians and priests who crucified him. Christianity comes from the cross, not Christ. Poor Jesus was simply hanged on the cross – so he is secondary. First comes the cross in relation to the religion founded after his name. In fact, it should be called “crossianity,” not Christianity. It is the cross that occupies the place of honor in the hearts and minds of people whose life is every day on the cross.\nMan as he is, is in suffering; he is perpetually on the cross. It is not much different whether it is the cross of the family or of relationships, of friendships or of enmities, of religions or of nationalities. For\nman, life is a cross that he has to carry on his shoulders from the cradle to the grave. For him, life is really a curse, a sin, not a blessing. And the cross became increasingly important to him, and he clung to it. In fact, Christianity is a worldwide conglomeration of all such pessimistic and miserable people.\nIt is relevant to note that the last two world wars were mostly fought by Christian countries. A few non-Christian countries that were involved in these wars were dragged into them by their imperialist masters, who were all Christians.\nJapan was the only non-Christian country that willingly joined the war as an aggressor. But Japan has ceased to be an eastern country except geographically; it is now virtually a part of the western world. And Japan has a long tradition of suicide which in Japanese is called hara-kiri. A Japanese kills himself on very small excuses; his wife has died, or he has committed an act of misdemeanor and he thinks he is finished with life. Then there is no way for him but to end his life – as if there is no hope of his redemption.\nAccording to this thinking, a tree should commit hara-kiri when its flowers wither – who knows if new flowers will open the next morning? The Japanese don’t have even this much hope and patience in their hearts. So the last two world wars were fought by peoples who have been traditionally associated with the cross and the custom of hara-kiri.\nIf the Third World War happens, it will spell the destruction of mankind; it will be a case of collective crucifixion of the human race. So what began with the crucifixion of a single individual is going to end in the collective crucifixion – the crucifixion of the entire race of homo sapiens. I don’t say that Jesus is responsible for it; the responsibility belongs to those who hanged him on the cross.\nI also don’t say that people rallied round the cross because they were influenced by Jesus; the contrary is the truth. They came to Jesus because they were influenced by the cross. But it is undeniably true that a civilization based on crossianism, on sado-masochism, was destined to lead mankind to self-destruction. Actually there is no sense in accepting the cross and worshipping it. Even if life bears a cross, it is in our hands to replace the cross with a flower.\nIn my view, Krishna’s flute is exactly the opposite of the cross. And it is important to know that while it is others who hang Jesus on the cross, they really impose it on him; Krishna chooses the flute for himself. It is necessary to bear in mind that while the flute is intrinsic to Krishna and his life – it symbolizes him – the cross is extrinsic to Christ; it does not represent him. It is others, the Jewish priests and the Roman governor, who force the cross on Christ.\nKrishna plays the flute for the love of it. Nobody has forced it on him; he has chosen it for himself. I see Krishna’s flute symbolizing life’s benediction and man’s gratefulness to life for this blessing. Krishna has made his choice for happiness, for bliss. In fact, when life is so good and great, Krishna cannot but choose to be happy, and he says it with the flute.\nAnd just as an unhappy person does not suffer alone, he makes many others unhappy, similarly a happy person becomes the source of happiness for countless numbers of people. So when Krishna plays his flute, its melody, its bliss, does not remain con fined to him, it gladdens all those whose hearts come to hear it. And it is as it should be.\nIf you happen to pass by a cross with Jesus hanging on it, you will immediately be depressed and sad. On the other hand, seeing Krishna dancing in ecstasy on the banks of the river Yamuna will fill your heart with delight and joy. Pleasure and pain, happiness and unhappiness are contagious; they are communicable from one to another; they spread and escalate like wildfire.\nSo the one who decides to be unhappy is condemning the whole world to be unhappy; he might as well say he has decided to punish the whole earth by choosing to be unhappy. And the person who decides to be happy is going to bless the whole to be happy, he is going to add to the song and music of life all over this planet. Therefore a happy person is a religious person; and an unhappy person is utterly irreligious.\nI call the man religious who brings happiness to himself and to others. For me, nothing except happiness, blissfulness, is a religious quality. In this sense Krishna is truly a religious person, whose whole being exudes nothing but happiness and bliss. And such a person can bless the whole of mankind, he is a living blessing to the world.\nBut you ask why did the war of the Mahabharat happen in a civilization that had accepted the flute as its symbol? I say, this happened in spite of Krishna’s flute. Krishna is not the cause of the Mahabharat. There is no relationship whatsoever between the flute and war. But there exists a logical relationship between the cross and war.\nThe Mahabharat took place in spite of Krishna and his flute. It simply means we are so attached to sorrow, so steeped in misery that even Krishna’s flute fails to bring a ray of hope and joy to our hearts. The flute continued to play, and we plunged into the vortex of war. The flute could not change our sado-masochistic minds; Krishna’s flute could not become our flute too.\nIt is interesting to know how difficult it is for someone to share in another’s happiness. It is so easy to share in another’s sorrow. You can easily cry with someone crying, but it is so hard to laugh with some one laughing. You can easily sympathize with one whose house has been burned down, but it is arduous to participate in the joys of one who has built himself a beautiful new house. And it is not without some fundamental reasons.\nIt is easy to come close to Jesus’ cross, because it strikes a note of empathy in our hearts, which are already filled with pain and misery. On the other hand Krishna’s flute will fill our hearts with envy and we will escape from him. Krishna’s bliss will bring up envy in us; it will not find an empathic response from our hearts.\nConversely, the cross will not make us jealous; it will certainly bring up our empathy. The happiness of another creates jealousy, and jealousy turns into misery. So to participate in another’s happiness is really arduous.\nIt needs extraordinary intelligence to participate in another’s happiness. To share in the joys of another, to make them one’s own is a rare quality; it is of the highest. But to share in another’s sorrow is not that difficult. It is so because we are ourselves burdened with sorrow and suffering; we are already in misery. So we have no difficulty in identifying ourselves with the suffering of others. But if someone is happy we fail to connect with him for the simple reason that we don’t know what happiness is, we are only unhappy in ourselves.\nI repeat, the Mahabharat happens in spite of the flute. It is interesting to note that after the advent of the cross it takes two thousand years for war to grow to its present dimensions of a massive war enveloping the whole earth, but the Mahabharat takes place even when Krishna is playing his flute.\nThe truth is that the flute and its message is not rightly understood and appreciated. It fails to make an impression on the sado-masochistic minds of the people.\nAnother thing worth considering in this context is that Krishna participates personally in the war. You cannot think of Jesus joining a war of any kind. If someone suggests to him to do so, he will say, “Have you gone mad? Don’t you know what I teach?” Jesus has said, “The prophets of the past have said that if someone gouges out your one eye you should take out his both, but I tell you if someone slaps you on the tight cheek, turn to him the other one too. And I tell you if someone takes your shirt, let him have your coat as well. And if someone asks you to carry his bag one mile, go with him two miles – maybe out of shyness he does not ask for more than a mile.” Now this person cannot be goaded into fighting a war.\nIt looks somewhat paradoxical and complex that while Jesus refuses even to resist evil, Krishna feels no compunction in leading a destructive war like the Mahabharat. But the reason is obvious. For Jesus, life is so miserable and meaningless that it is not worth fighting for. For Krishna, on the other hand, life is so blissful that even a war can be risked for it.\nI would like to go into this matter rather deeply, because it is significant for us and our times.\nFor Jesus, life as it is is so utterly miserable and meaningless that a slap or two on the cheek will not add to its pile of miseries. It can be said that his cup of suffering is so full that any more suffering will not make a difference. So he turns his other cheek to you so you don’t have to take the trouble of turning it yourself. He is already so miserable that you cannot make him any more miserable.\nFor this reason, Jesus cannot be persuaded to take part in war. He alone can agree to fight who declares that life is a blessing and not a curse, that life is bliss and not suffering. He will stake everything to defend the joy and bliss of life. He will do anything for the sake of life.\nNot only Jesus, even Mahavira and Buddha will not say yes to war. Only Krishna is capable of doing it. If there is any other person in the world of spiritualism and religion who can come near Krishna in this respect, it is Mohammed. At some level, at some depth Mohammed is closer to Krishna than others, although he cannot be fully with Krishna.\nWhosoever feels that there is something precious and worthwhile in life which needs to be preserved, to be fought for – he will join hands with Krishna. For those who think otherwise, who see nothing in life worth preserving, the question simply does not arise.\nBut remember, Krishna is not a warmonger. He is not a hawk, as some pacifists would like to call him. He is a supporter of life, he stands by life, and he will fight for it if need be. If the great values of life – without which life would cease to be life – are in peril, Krishna will not hesitate to defend them with missiles. Not that he relishes violence or war, but if it becomes unavoidable he will not shirk the responsibility.\nThat is why, from the beginning, he does everything to avoid the Mahabharat. He leaves no stone unturned to avert war and save life and peace. But when all his efforts for peace fail, he realizes that the recalcitrant forces of death and destruction – forces that are against righteousness and religion – are not amenable to an honorable peace. He readies himself to fight on behalf of life and religion.\nAs I see it, life and religion are not two different things for Krishna. And therefore he can fight as naturally as he can dance. It is remarkable that a man like Krishna, even when he goes to the battlefield, is happy and joyful; he never loses his bliss. And men like Jesus are sad even as they keep a distance from the battlefield. Krishna can be blissful even on the battlefield, because war comes to him as part of life; it cannot be segregated from life.\nAs I said earlier, Krishna does not divide life into black and white, good and evil, as the moralists and monks do. He does not subscribe to the view that war is purely evil. He says that nothing is good or evil under all circumstances. There are occasions when poison can work like nectar and nectar can work like poison. There are moments when blessings turn into curses and curses into blessings.\nNothing is certain for all time and space, under all circumstances. The same thing can be good in one time and bad in another; it is really determined by the moment at hand. Nothing can be predetermined and prejudged. If someone does so. he is in for troubles in life, because life is a flux where everything changes from moment to moment. So Krishna lives in the moment; nothing is predetermined for him.\nFor long, Krishna does his best to avert war, but when he finds that it is inescapable he accepts it without hesitation. He does not want that one should go to war with a heavy heart, he does not believe in doing anything reluctantly in fact. If war becomes inescapable he will go to it with all his heart and mind.\nWith all his heart he tries to avert it, and when he fails, he goes to war whole-heartedly. In the beginning of war, as you know, he has no mind to take any active part in it. He tells Arjuna that he will not use his particular weapon – sudarshan – on the battlefield, he will only work as Arjuna’s charioteer. But then a moment comes when he takes the sudarshan in his hand and becomes an active participant in the war.\nAs I said, Krishna lives in the moment; he lives moment to moment. In fact, every blissful person lives in the moment; that is, he lives in a timeless space.\nBut those who choose unhappiness and are pessimistic and miserable cannot afford to live in the moment; they live in time, they have a time-continuum. They have a long span of time – not chronological but psychological – which extends both to the past and the future. And it is this time- continuum that makes for their abiding misery and anguish. They carry with them the heavy load of all the miseries of the dead past – which is no more, and all the imagi-nable miseries of the endless future – which is yet to come. So of course they feel crushed under the dead weight of their psychological pain and agony.\nOn the other hand, a man of bliss does not accept the existence of any other time except the present, the living moment. He has no past and no future; for him the whole of existence is squeezed into the moment, in the now. For him the moment is eternity itself, and he journeys from one moment\nthrough another. He dies totally to the past – which is not. And he does not take into account the future – which is yet to come. For him both past and future are non-existential. Such a person is fully responsible to this moment. To be open to the living moment is his way of life, his joy, his bliss.\nA masochist, a seeker of pain and misery, is utterly blind to the present, to the moment. He is closed in himself, like a cocoon; he is not responsive to that which is. If you take him to a rosebush and say to him, “Hey, man! Look at these blossoms, how enchanting they are!” he will say, “What worth is this beauty which is going to wither away by the evening?” Speak to him about the splendor of youth and his reaction will be, “It is nothing; soon it will pass into old age and to the grave.” About happiness he will say, “It is nothing more than a mirage, an illusion; the more you chase it, the more distant it becomes. I am not going to be deceived by it.” His mind is always set on time, the future; he never lives in the moment.\nA hedonist, on the other hand, lives totally in the moment. He is finished with his past, and so he does not think of the future either, which is psychologically nothing but a projection of the past. Coming to a garden in bloom, the blissful person will be totally with the riot of colors, he will dance and sing with the dancing flowers. And he will tell the pessimist, “Why should I worry about the evening which is not yet here, when even these flowers which are going to wither away are not the least concerned about it? Look at them, how festive they are!”\nAnd the wonder of wonders is that when the evening comes, the man of bliss celebrates the withering of the flowers with the same enthusiasm with which he had celebrated their blossoming in the morning. Who says that only blooming flowers are enchanting? The withering ones are as beautiful to look at! They are as beautiful as they were in the morning, but our sorrow-filled eyes fail to perceive that beauty.\nWho says only sunrise is beautiful? Sunset is not a whit less beautiful. Who says only children are beautiful and not the old people? Old age has its own beauty, its own grace. When a person like Ravindranath or Walt Whitman, really grows into old age, his beauty is immeasurable.\nLooking at Walt Whitman in his old age, one feels to have come across a beauty that cannot be surpassed. In fact, if childhood has a beauty of its own, youth and old age each have some distinctive beauty which is no less fascinating. When one’s hair becomes snow-white, when one is about to complete his life’s journey, when one is loose and relaxed, he radiates a beauty and grace that you find in the sunset. But a pessimist cannot know it.\nI repeat: a Krishna lives in the moment. The journey of bliss is the journey of the moment. It is really wrong to call it a journey, because you cannot travel in the moment; you can only drown in it. You can travel in time, but in the moment you can only sink deeper and deeper.\nThe way of the moment is vertical, it is not horizontal. The moment has only depth, and no length at all; whereas time has only length, and no depth at all. Therefore one who sinks into the moment transcends time, he goes beyond time. One who reaches the timeless, achieves the eternal. So Krishna is in the moment and eternity together. The moment is eternity itself.\nBut one who lives in time can never know the eternal, because time is a series, a continuity; it stretches from the dead past to an unborn and unknown future. Time is tension, time is anxiety and\nmisery. One who lives in time does not live really, because all the time he is either brooding over his past, which is gone forever, or he is worrying about a future which is yet to be born. When it is morning he is thinking of the evening; when he is alive he is worrying about death. The moment he meets a loved one, he begins to grieve over the separation that is going to happen in some future.\nKrishna is accused of breaking promises he makes from time to time. A moment comes in the battle of Mahabharat when he takes up arms, his sudarshan chakra, although he had given his word that he would not take an active part in the fighting, he would only act as Arjuna’s charioteer.\nIn answer to the charge, Krishna would say, “The one who made the promise is no more, nor is the moment which had brought forth the promise.” He will ask, “Where is the Ganges that was there at the time my promise was being made? Where are the flowers that had bloomed at that moment? Where are those clouds that had glided through the sky when I had given the assurance in question? Everything has changed, everything has moved away since then. How can you bind me with that moment which too is gone? I am now existing in the moment that is before me, and I am responding to it totally.”\nKrishna does not apologize for the so-called breach of promise, nor does he regret it. He never repents; he never recants. He is true to the moment.\nWhat do I mean when I say he is true to the moment? He is so utterly true to the existing moment that even if it confronts him with an unthought-of eventuality he goes into it without flinching and as totally as ever.\nOf course, he will seem, at times, to be some what unfaithful to us, to the conventional society, because he does not keep his promises. That is the difficulty with a person like Krishna who is true to existence. Such a person cannot be as true to the society he lives in – because while the society lives in time, he lives in the timeless, in eternity. The society has a past and a future to care for, while Krishna has none. He is free, absolutely free,\nA young man came to Rinzai, a celebrated Zen sage who lived in the mountains. The young man said to Rinzai, “I am in search of truth, and it is this search that has brought me to you from a long distance.”\nRinzai said to him, “Leave aside this matte of truth for the present. I want to know something else from you since you are coming from Peking. Can you say what is the price of rice in Peking?”\nThe youth was flabbergasted to hear such a question from a great Master like Rinzai, who supposedly had nothing to do with such mundane matters as the price of rice in Peking. He had made a long and arduous journey in search of the highest. He had never imagined that a great sage like Rinzai would talk about such a petty thing in place of truth.\nSo the young man said to Rinzai, “Excuse me, sir, for my impertinence. But I say it so you don’t ask any more questions like the one before me. I don’t carry any past with me, I leave behind me the paths that I travel, burn the bridges that I cross, pull down the stairs that I climb. I die to the past totally, even to the minutes just gone by.”\n“Then sit down.” said Rinzai patting the youth’s back. “Now we will talk about truth. I brought up the question of the price of rice only to know if you yet carry your past with you. Had you remembered the price of rice in Peking when you left it, I would have flatly refused to talk about truth. One who clings to his past cannot come to truth, because truth is always now and here, it is in the moment. Truth has nothing to do with the past nor with the future. Truth is really timeless, and one who lives in the past can never be in the present. Truth and time don’t walk together.”\nThe Mahabharat happens in spite of Krishna. And yet Krishna becomes a participant in the war, because a partisan of bliss can become a partisan of war too. And Krishna believes that war is as much part of life as peace is. One cannot be without the other. And war will be with us as long as life exists on this earth. Maybe, the character of war will change, its structure and shape will vary, its plane, strategy, and style will be different, but war will continue.\nIt is impossible that war will ever disappear from the earth. It can only disappear from the earth if man himself disappears from here. Or it can disappear if man becomes perfect. Unless the human race as a whole reaches its perfection, or becomes extinct as a species, there is no way to abolish war. Man as he is cannot do without war. War has always been with us; it is with us now, and it is going to be with us in the future. Then what is the problem in regard to war.\nKrishna’s answer to this question is, war should be righteous, it should be waged for the highest values of life like freedom and truth.\nIn the same way, peace needs to be righteous. Remember, some kinds of peace can be unrighteous, irreligious, and war can be made to uphold religion and truth.\nThe pacifist thinks that peace is always righteous, and the warmonger thinks that war is right in every case. Krishna is neither a partisan of peace nor of war; he really has no “isms.” He is not bound to any ideology, he is liquid like water. He is never stagnant, he is always moving with life. He is not solid and immobile like a rock; he is fluid like air. So he says, “Peace can be evil too.”\nFor example, a pacifist who is religiously committed to peace is passing a street where someone is being robbed. He can say that he has nothing to do with others’ feuds and strifes, and he refuses to interfere in the matter, going peacefully on his way. This peace is irreligious, because it is indirectly helping someone rob another person who may be innocent and helpless. It is not necessary that peace is right in every case. Men like Bertrand Russell think that peace is always right, it is inviolable. But he is only being dogmatic about peace.\nSometimes cowardice and impotence can take shelter behind the facade of peace. Krishna tells Arjuna again and again, “Give up faint-heartedness, O Arjuna. I had never thought that you could be as unmanly and impotent as your words reveal you to be. When war faces you, war that forces of unrighteousness have unleashed, it does not become you to talk like a coward. Where is your manliness, your skill?”\nPeace is not necessarily righteous, nor is war unrighteous. It depends on the conditions that bring the forces of peace and war into play. But then you can say that warmongers are right in claiming that war is righteous. They can claim so, and nobody can prevent them. Life is very complex. But they will find it increasingly difficult to make such a claim if understanding grows among the people of what religion is.\nLet me explain to you what religion and irreligion are according to Krishna. That which helps life grow, flower and dance ecstatically is religion. And that which impedes life’s growth, which distorts and stifles life’s flowering, which smothers life’s joy and festivity is irreligion. Irreligion is what blocks and suffocates life; religion is what helps it to come to its fulfillment.\nQuestion 2\nQUESTIONER: WHO HAS EVER UNDERSTOOD AND IMBIBED KRISHNA RIGHTLY? WHAT SHOULD ONE DO TO IMBIBE HIM? CAN YOU GIVE AN OUTLINE OF HUMAN CIVILIZATION AND CULTURE PATTERNED ON. KRISHNA’S LIFE AND TEACHINGS?\nHow can one imbibe another? How can one take after Krishna or anyone else? And why? Is it incumbent on me to imbibe another, become like another? I can only imbibe and be myself, not Krishna.\nKrishna does not pattern himself after another. He imbibes himself and remains himself. Why should another try to pattern himself after Krishna, to be like him? It is enough that I imbibe myself and am totally myself. No, to imbibe another, to be like another, is the worst kind of corruption, and it is the greatest injustice that someone can do to himself.\nThe whole idea of imitation is mistaken and wrong. I have my own soul which should come to its full flowering. What will happen to it, to my own soul if I imbibe another and copy him? It is true, I can impose another’s personality on myself, which can overpower me, but what will happen to me, to my own being? I owe a responsibility to myself, and if I become like someone else I will be betraying myself.\nNo, it is enough if one understands Krishna. Trying to be like him is utterly uncalled for. Understanding is enough. And one should understand him, not with a view to imbibe and imitate him, to be his carbon-copy, but to understand himself and be himself.\nYou certainly have to know how a person like Krishna is fulfilled and also know the laws of this fulfillment. You certainly have to understand how Krishna attains to his naturalness and spontaneity, so that you can come to your own naturalness and spontaneity. Krishna’s life can give you a cue, a clue to know yourself and come to yourself. If Krishna can flower, why not you? If Krishna’s self- nature can blossom, why should you go on withering and wasting as you do? If Krishna can laugh and sing and dance, why should you continue to shed tears and be miserable?\nIt is not that you will dance the way Krishna dances. Your dance will be different, it will be your own; you will uncover your own innate dance. You don’t have to copy Krishna’s dance, you have only to know the law that helped him to find his dance and be fulfilled. Krishna’s life can help you in self discovery, which is of the highest. Self discovery, and not assimilation or imitation, is what you have to seek. And Krishna’s life can be of tremendous help in this adventure.\nSo the first thing to know is that no one can be your ideal, not even Krishna. And you need not follow and imitate another, Krishna included.\nIt is true that any number of people have wasted their lives following and imitating others. In reality, no one can wholly succeed in becoming like another; it is impossible. You can impose another’s\npersonality on yourself, wear his mask and look like him, but you cannot make your very soul into him. Do what you can, you cannot succeed; at best you can enact him, but it will not be more than acting. Being cannot be borrowed; it is always one’s own. In spite of all efforts, you will remain what you innately are.\nImitation is dangerous in many ways. To imitate someone you have to suppress yourself, suppress your individuality, your self-nature. And this suppression can be so deep that you will lose all con tact with yourself – which is the worst thing that can happen to any individual. Although you will yet survive at your innermost core as yourself, you will now be far removed from yourself. That is the problem.\nMillions of people down the ages have tried to imitate Krishna, Buddha, Christ and others, but none has succeeded so far. Success is impossible. Five thousand years have passed since Krishna happened, but there has not been a second Krishna in all history. Twenty-five hundred years have passed after Buddha, and there has not yet been another Buddha. Nor has there been another Zarathustra, Jesus, or Mohammed.\nWhosoever tries to imitate others is destined to court failure. It is really worse than failure, it is disaster, it is suicide. Even as suicide it is the worst kind. In ordinary suicide, as we know, only one’s physical form is destroyed. In this suicide the very soul is sought to be destroyed. So all followers, all disciples, all imitators are suicidal.\nMany people try to imitate Krishna, and in the process they not only injure themselves but they also injure Krishna. If you copy Krishna, you will, with all your efforts, make yourself a caricature of him. And this thing will not only distort you, but it will also distort Krishna’s image. You will imitate him in your own way, and to that extent you will distort him, you will adulterate him.\nSo you are not only insulting and abusing yourself, but you are also insulting and abusing Krishna. So this imitation is really outrageous. All theologians, all priests – whether they follow Krishna or Christ – are guilty of this crime. And they all tell the same story – the story of man’s failure to be himself, the story of man’s attempts at suicide.\nBut we cannot say the same thing about Meera and Chaitanya. They are a class by themselves, and they are certainly no imitators. Through understanding Krishna’s ways of expressing himself, his self nature, Meera and Chaitanya express themselves as they are; they reveal their own distinctive self natures. They don’t impose Krishna on themselves, nor do they ape his lifestyle, his demeanor, his songs and dances. They sing their own songs; they dance their own dances.\nSo Meera remains Meera and Chaitanya re mains Chaitanya. Of course they carry with them their love of Krishna, and as this love grows Chaitanya and Meera disappear as egos. As this love grows even Krishna disappears and only love remains. If you ask Chaitanya if he is Chaitanya or Krishna in that moment, he will say, “I really don’t know who I am; I even don’t know if I am.” In this moment even the “I” disappears, and only an “am-ness” remains. This is pure existence. And this achievement of Chaitanya is the flowering and fruition of his own self-nature. There is nothing of imitation about it,\nWe are all prone to imitate others. And there is a good reason for it. Imitation is like ready-made garments: buy and wear garments. You don’t have to do a thing, not even to wait for them. It suits our easygoing minds which want everything gratuitously.\nTo explore ant find one’s own innate being is arduous, to imitate Krishna is easy enough. It takes time to be oneself, but imitation comes in handy, Self nature, self-fulfillment, has to be earned, borrow ing is effortless, convenient.\nBut this pursuit of convenience is disastrous; it really lands one into the very vortex of sorrow and misery. So never commit the mistake of imitating others; it is utterly disastrous. It is calamitous.\nI call him a religious person who goes on a voyage of self-discovery, who really discovers himself. In this adventure of self-discovery, understanding Krishna or Mahavira, Buddha or Jesus, can be helpful. Because in understanding others we lay the foundation of self-knowledge which is central to spiritualism. Instead of knowing oneself directly, it is easier to know through knowing others, because others provide you with a distance, a perspective to know.\nBecause there is a lack of distance between the knower and the known, direct self-knowledge is really arduous. So in understanding oneself, the other is helpful. But when you go to understand another – Krishna, Buddha or Mahavira – remember, he is only a means to self understanding and self discovery. He is not your goal.\nYou might have observed on many occasions that when somebody comes to consult you about a complex problem of his own, you advise him so competently. But when it comes to your own problem, even a simple problem, you begin to shake in your shoes.\nWhat is the matter? You are considered to be a very wise man by many who rush to you in their hours of difficulty for your sage advice, and you have the reputation of solving many of their problems. But when you are yourself in a mess you rush to others – perhaps to those very people you have helped – for their advice. The reason is that you are so close to your problem, you are so involved in it, that you can’t have the perspective to correctly figure it out.\nIt is comparatively easy to understand others and if we see others as a medium for self- understanding then the lives of men like Krishna and Buddha are of immense value. Then as we grow in self-understanding, Krishna and Christ, Mahavira and Buddha will drop by the wayside and we will be left with ourselves in our utter purity.\nThis purity of the self, this virginity, this un spoiled innocence is what matters. And attainment of this innocence, purity, is freedom. This ultimate purity or aloneness is called nirvana or ultimate liberation. This primeval innocence is called Krishna consciousness or God or what you will.\nOne who reaches this supreme state of being with the help of Krishna will say that he has attained to Krishna. This is a way of repaying an old debt that he owes to Krishna, this is a way of expressing one’s gratitude to him. One who attains to this ultimate state with the help of Buddha, will say that he has attained Buddhahood. He is only expressing his gratitude to one whose life and teachings helped him in his arduous journey of self-discovery.\nUltimately, every seeker – whether he walks with Krishna or Christ – discovers himself. He cannot discover the other, because the other is not. The day I find myself, when I know who I am, the other, the “thou” ceases to be. But I will need some name to describe my experience, and certainly I will use one which helped me in coming to myself, in coming home.\nOne last thing, and then we will sit for meditation. Question 3\nQUESTIONER: A PART OF THE QUESTION YET REMAINS TO BE ANSWERED. PLEASE GIVE US AN OUTLINE OF HUMAN CIVILIZATION AND CULTURE PATTERNED ON KRISHNA’S LIFE AND TEACHING.\nIt will need a lengthy answer. All these days, however, I have been doing the same thing – drawing an outline of human civilization reflecting Krishna’s vision. Yet I would like to say a few things in this regard.\nHuman civilization, according to Krishna’s vision, will be life-affirmative and natural in the first place. This is my vision too, that affirmation of life and nature should be the cornerstone of human civilization if it wants to be healthy and holistic. Such a civilization will be dedicated to the moment, to bliss and to celebration.\nThis civilization will refuse to be life negative, renunciatory, masochistic and time-oriented. It will reject all fragmentation of life. Life will be accepted as a blessing, and there will be no division whatsoever, between life and God.\nThis civilization will declare that life is God, and there is no other God in opposition to life or separate from life. That life itself is God will be the overall truth of man. This man will declare there is no creator other than creation; creativity itself is God.\nThis summing up will be clear to you if you take it in the context of the whole discussion we have had here for these ten days. During these days I said many things, some of which might have pleased you and some others which might have displeased you. But remember, both pleasant and unpleasant feelings come in the way of right understanding. Without trying to understand, we gullibly accept that which is pleasant and reject off-hand all that is unpleasant. I don’t want you either to accept or to reject; all I want is that you should understand simply, effortlessly, and naturally.\nI don’t want that you should collect my words and take them home. That will not be worthwhile. What is worthwhile then? If in the course of listening to my words, some understanding, some wisdom has dawned on you – and it that understanding, that wisdom is really worthwhile, then it will go with you naturally, effortlessly.\nIt is like you visit a garden full of flowers and fragrance, and when you leave it, the garden is left behind but some of its fragrance goes with you – clinging in your nostrils, in your hair, in your clothes. So leave the flowers of words behind and take their essence, if you have gathered it, with you.\nMy words are as useless as all words are, but if in your encounter with them something has clicked in your being it is certainly of great significance.\nMy words, or any words for that matter, can have significance if you listen to them with an open mind, an unprejudiced and empty mind, without judging them, without identifying with them or condemning them. They can give rise to some understanding of wisdom in you if you listen without saying, “This is right and that is wrong. That is what I believe too, and that is what is against my belief.”\nIf you think that I am for Krishna and against Mahavira or whoever is your favorite, you will only earn unhappiness, and not understanding. But I will not be responsible for your sorrow; nor will Krishna or Mahavira. The responsibility will be entirely yours. Even if you happily think that I am in support of Krishna, who is your favored avatara or incarnation of God, you have missed me, you will remain as ignorant as you were when you came here.\nI have nothing to do with Krishna: I am neither for him nor against him. I have unfolded his life and teachings exactly as I see them, and I am not concerned with what you think about it.\nAnd remember, I live in the moment, I live moment to moment; I am not at all predictable or dependable. From what I say today one should not and cannot infer what I am going to say tomorrow. What I say today is exactly how I see it today. And what I will say tomorrow will be exactly how I see it tomorrow. And what you understand while listening to me today or any day is not important. But if this listening adds to your understanding, your intelligence, it has done its work. Understanding is important, all-important.\nI hope these ten days have helped you grow in understanding, in clarity, and in some degree opened you to the sun of life and truth. I don’t say by what name – Krishna or Buddha or Christ – you should call him when that sun of understanding comes to you.\nI say this much: that if your mind is uncluttered and empty, if your heart is vulnerable and your perception is clear, there is no doubt whatsoever that the sun will rise and you will see light, you will be illumined. What you will call it will depend on you. The sun will not come saying, “I am so and so”; he is really without a name.\nBut remember, he alone has an open heart mind who lives with understanding, who lives in understanding, who lives without ideas and ideals, concepts and beliefs, creeds, doctrines and dogmas. He alone is vulnerable to life and truth who is not a partisan of some belief-system like Hinduism Catholicism or communism.\nIn fact, ideas and concepts, doctrines and dogmas are meant for those who have no intelligence and understanding of their own. They go to the market of ready-made ideologies and philosophies and buy them from theologians, priests and philosophers by mortgaging their own minds. Understanding is like a river – fluid and alive and flowing. All philosophies and theologies, all doctrines and dogmas are like stagnating pools of water, dead and stinking.\nSo if you have listened to me through the screen of your thoughts and beliefs – it makes no difference whether you are their partisans or enemies – you have not listened to me at all. Then you will never understand that which I have said.\nThe last thing that I have to say is this: I have nothing to do with Krishna; I have no relationship with him. I am not for him or against him; neither have I intention of converting you into his partisans or enemies. I have used Krishna exactly as a painter uses a canvas. The painter has nothing more to do with the canvas than to express himself through some colors daubed on it. I too had a few colors to spread on Krishna’s canvas, and I am finished with it. Even Mahavira’s or Buddha’s canvas would have served my purpose.\nAnd it is not necessary for me that I should use the same kind of colors on every canvas; nor am I committed to create the same kind of portraits on every canvas. I am free to express myself the way I am, and in the way I choose to express. If I am a real painter, I will create a different kind of painting, even a contradictory painting, each time I take paint and brush in my hands. He is only an imitator who repeats the same work again and again.\nIt is not necessary that you should cling rigidly to my statements. It is enough that you understand them and move ahead of them, You should leave the statements and live with their understanding, their essence.\nIf you do so you will not ever be in danger of clinging to my words. It will do me no harm if you cling to them, but it will certainly harm you immensely, because when one clings to some person or idea or thing, he immediately loses himself. And when one is free of all clingings and attachments, when one is utterly empty, he is immediately filled with himself, with the eternal, or God, or call it what you will.\nIt is with this hope that I talked to you these few days sitting in the lap of the Himalayas. I am grateful to you for having listened to me with such love, patience and peace, and I bow to God sitting inside each one of you.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"9242","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/krishna__the_man_and_his_philosophy/part21/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/krishna__the_man_and_his_philosophy/>Krishna - The Man and His Philosophy</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">21 Choose the Flute or Perish</h1><div class=post-meta>44 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;9242 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Krishna__The_Man_and_His_Philosophy/part21.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part20>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

OBSERVED, “THE CIVILIZATION THAT BEGAN WITH THE CROSS HAD TO END UP IN
AN ATOMIC WAR, AND THEREFORE THE MODERN CIVILIZATION IS FACED WITH A
CHOICE BETWEEN THE CROSS AND THE FLUTE.” BUT EH QUESTION IS THAT THE
CIVILIZATION THAT BEGAN WITH THE FLUTE ALSO ENDED UP IN A WAR – THE WAR
OF MAHABHARAT. PLEASE EXPLAIN THE ANOMALY.</p><p><br></p><p>The cross is the symbol of death. It is okay as an emblem of the
grave, but it is dangerous to accept it as a symbol of life. But many
so-called religious people have treated human life and body as no more
than a grave, and it is going to result in a disaster.</p><p><br></p><p>A man bearing a crucifix on his breast declares that life is not
acceptable to him; he is worshipping death really. For him life is a
curse, not a blessing. Christianity – I don’t mean Jesus – believes that
man is born in sin, that life is the original sin. According to them,
what we think of as life is not God’s gift, but a form of punishment
inflicted on man.</p><p><br></p><p>This kind of thinking is essentially masochistic, pessimistic,
morbid. Standing near a rosebush a pessimist takes note of every thorn,
but he ignores the flowers altogether. Looking at day and night, a
pessimist sees two dark nights sandwiching a short day instead of seeing
two bright days enclosing a brief dark night. Such a mind gathers
together all the hurt and pain of life and completely forgets its
delights and pleasures.</p><p>In fact, paying too much attention to the miseries of life is the
sign of a diseased mind, a neurotic and deranged mind. Of course a
philosophy of life that affirms and emphasizes sorrow and suffering is
bound to be negative and nihilistic. And this is what the cross
represents.</p><p><br></p><p>Had he not been crucified, Jesus would have never made such a
powerful impact on the world. In all probability the world would have
forgotten him. His crucifixion became the foundation of
Christianity.</p><p><br></p><p>Today nearly a billion people all over the world are within the fold
of Christianity. I don’t take this to be the triumph of Christ, it is
undoubtedly the victory of the cross. Jesus hanging on the cross became
a great attraction for our miserable and diseased minds. Our lives are
virtually on the cross; we are ridden with anxiety, sorrow and
suffering. We are a people who collect only hurt and pain, as some
people collect used stamps. We all have our stockpiles of miseries; we
don’t have any remembrance of having any happy moments in life.</p><p><br></p><p>Krishna is absolutely the opposite type of individual, and his flute
as a symbol is just the opposite of the cross. There is no sense in
putting a flute on a grave; it needs throbbing lips and supple fingers
to play it. It needs a singing and dancing heart, a soul brimming with
joy and bliss to hold it. And I think it is time man makes a clear
choice between the cross of Jesus and the flute of Krishna.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not that life is without its hurts and pains; it cannot be. But
if a person brings his focus only to the hurt and pain and goes on
accumulating them, he will soon cease to meet with any happy moments in
life. It is not that there is no happiness in life; it has its fair
share of happiness too. And if someone trains his attention on happiness
alone and goes on gathering it, he will eventually cease to come across
painful moments in life.</p><p><br></p><p>Life consists of both pleasure and pain, happiness and misery. And it
depends on us what we choose to see and take. My own understanding is
that if someone sees rightly and loves rose flowers, then soon the
thorns on the rosebush will disappear from his sight. Eyes attuned to
the beauty and fragrance of the flower don’t take notice of the thorns.
Not that the thorns disappear from the bush; they become part and parcel
of the grandeur of the roses, and one sees them as something protecting
the roses. They are really to protect the flowers, not to hurt
anyone.</p><p><br></p><p>But if someone sees only thorns he will miss the flowers. He will
say, “How can there be any flowers in the midst of so many piercing
thorns and thistles?” He cannot even think of flowers where thorns
abound. For him thorns become the truth and flowers disappear like
dreams. But for a lover of flowers, thorns become illusory and flowers
the truth.</p><p><br></p><p>It depends on man, what he chooses; he is free to choose. There is a
saying of Sartre’s which is strange but close to truth. He says, “Man is
condemned to be free.” It seems freedom is an imposition on us,
inflicted on us. It seems we can choose every thing except freedom –
because we are free to choose or not to choose it. Never had anyone
described freedom as something inflicted on man.</p><p><br></p><p>Man is free, and this freedom affirms his being God. But he can
choose anything – even not being God. Similarly, he is free to choose
pain and misery. Life will be pure suffering for one who makes suffering
his choice. We become that which we choose to become. In fact, we see
what we want to see; we find what we want to find; we receive what we
ask for. So if you seek suffering you are going to have it, without
fail.</p><p>The irony is that if someone opts for suffering he does not suffer
alone, he makes many others suffer with him. And this is where
immorality comes into being. Unhappiness is a contagious disease: a
single unhappy person can be the cause of the unhappiness of thousands.
It is impossible that an unhappy man can make another happy. How can he
give happiness to another when he refuses to take it for himself.
Remember, we can share with others only that which we have, not what we
don’t have.</p><p><br></p><p>One who has turned his life into a bundle of hurts and wounds is
going to be the cause of much suffering in the lives of many people
around him. Since suffering has become his life’s breath, wherever he
goes he will carry the germs of suffering with him. So an unhappy man
does not suffer alone, he shares his sorrow with everybody he comes in
contact with. Walking or sitting, speaking or silent, active or
inactive, he emits and transmits the vibes of unhappiness like nuclear
fallout all around him. An unhappy person really adds to the unhappiness
of the whole world.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember, when you choose unhappiness, you are not choosing it for
yourself alone, but for the whole world as such.</p><p><br></p><p>As I said, it is man’s preference for pain and suffering which the
cross symbolizes. And that has led him to the doorstep of war – a war
that is going to be a total war. For the first time, mankind is on the
brink of committing global suicide. But he has asked for it by opting
for misery.</p><p><br></p><p>We know very well that sometimes individuals driven up the wall
commit suicide in despair. But for the first time a situation for
collective suicide has arisen, when the whole of mankind has become so
miserable that it is going to commit global hara-kiri.</p><p><br></p><p>It seems war has become our way of life, and the mounting number of
wars are nothing but our mounting steps to collective death and
destruction. And this destruction is the cumulative effect of mankind’s
choice of suffering. Really, war is of our own choosing, it does not
descend out of the blue.</p><p><br></p><p>And when we court suffering religiously, when we accept it as
something religious, then no thing remains to be chosen irreligiously.
When we turn sorrow into a religion, then there is nothing like
irreligion on the earth. Sorrow is really enshrined when it is made part
of religion.</p><p><br></p><p>A whole milieu of unhappiness and misery was created around the
cross. I don’t say it was created around Jesus, because Jesus is not
necessarily connected with the cross; he could very well do without the
cross. The fact is, that Christianity was created not by Jesus, but by
the people who crucified him.</p><p><br></p><p>I always say Christianity was not founded by Jesus; its real founders
were those Jewish theologians and priests who crucified him.
Christianity comes from the cross, not Christ. Poor Jesus was simply
hanged on the cross – so he is secondary. First comes the cross in
relation to the religion founded after his name. In fact, it should be
called “crossianity,” not Christianity. It is the cross that occupies
the place of honor in the hearts and minds of people whose life is every
day on the cross.</p><p><br></p><p>Man as he is, is in suffering; he is perpetually on the cross. It is
not much different whether it is the cross of the family or of
relationships, of friendships or of enmities, of religions or of
nationalities. For</p><p>man, life is a cross that he has to carry on his shoulders from the
cradle to the grave. For him, life is really a curse, a sin, not a
blessing. And the cross became increasingly important to him, and he
clung to it. In fact, Christianity is a worldwide conglomeration of all
such pessimistic and miserable people.</p><p><br></p><p>It is relevant to note that the last two world wars were mostly
fought by Christian countries. A few non-Christian countries that were
involved in these wars were dragged into them by their imperialist
masters, who were all Christians.</p><p><br></p><p>Japan was the only non-Christian country that willingly joined the
war as an aggressor. But Japan has ceased to be an eastern country
except geographically; it is now virtually a part of the western world.
And Japan has a long tradition of suicide which in Japanese is called
hara-kiri. A Japanese kills himself on very small excuses; his wife has
died, or he has committed an act of misdemeanor and he thinks he is
finished with life. Then there is no way for him but to end his life –
as if there is no hope of his redemption.</p><p><br></p><p>According to this thinking, a tree should commit hara-kiri when its
flowers wither – who knows if new flowers will open the next morning?
The Japanese don’t have even this much hope and patience in their
hearts. So the last two world wars were fought by peoples who have been
traditionally associated with the cross and the custom of hara-kiri.</p><p><br></p><p>If the Third World War happens, it will spell the destruction of
mankind; it will be a case of collective crucifixion of the human race.
So what began with the crucifixion of a single individual is going to
end in the collective crucifixion – the crucifixion of the entire race
of homo sapiens. I don’t say that Jesus is responsible for it; the
responsibility belongs to those who hanged him on the cross.</p><p><br></p><p>I also don’t say that people rallied round the cross because they
were influenced by Jesus; the contrary is the truth. They came to Jesus
because they were influenced by the cross. But it is undeniably true
that a civilization based on crossianism, on sado-masochism, was
destined to lead mankind to self-destruction. Actually there is no sense
in accepting the cross and worshipping it. Even if life bears a cross,
it is in our hands to replace the cross with a flower.</p><p><br></p><p>In my view, Krishna’s flute is exactly the opposite of the cross. And
it is important to know that while it is others who hang Jesus on the
cross, they really impose it on him; Krishna chooses the flute for
himself. It is necessary to bear in mind that while the flute is
intrinsic to Krishna and his life – it symbolizes him – the cross is
extrinsic to Christ; it does not represent him. It is others, the Jewish
priests and the Roman governor, who force the cross on Christ.</p><p><br></p><p>Krishna plays the flute for the love of it. Nobody has forced it on
him; he has chosen it for himself. I see Krishna’s flute symbolizing
life’s benediction and man’s gratefulness to life for this blessing.
Krishna has made his choice for happiness, for bliss. In fact, when life
is so good and great, Krishna cannot but choose to be happy, and he says
it with the flute.</p><p><br></p><p>And just as an unhappy person does not suffer alone, he makes many
others unhappy, similarly a happy person becomes the source of happiness
for countless numbers of people. So when Krishna plays his flute, its
melody, its bliss, does not remain con fined to him, it gladdens all
those whose hearts come to hear it. And it is as it should be.</p><p>If you happen to pass by a cross with Jesus hanging on it, you will
immediately be depressed and sad. On the other hand, seeing Krishna
dancing in ecstasy on the banks of the river Yamuna will fill your heart
with delight and joy. Pleasure and pain, happiness and unhappiness are
contagious; they are communicable from one to another; they spread and
escalate like wildfire.</p><p><br></p><p>So the one who decides to be unhappy is condemning the whole world to
be unhappy; he might as well say he has decided to punish the whole
earth by choosing to be unhappy. And the person who decides to be happy
is going to bless the whole to be happy, he is going to add to the song
and music of life all over this planet. Therefore a happy person is a
religious person; and an unhappy person is utterly irreligious.</p><p><br></p><p>I call the man religious who brings happiness to himself and to
others. For me, nothing except happiness, blissfulness, is a religious
quality. In this sense Krishna is truly a religious person, whose whole
being exudes nothing but happiness and bliss. And such a person can
bless the whole of mankind, he is a living blessing to the world.</p><p><br></p><p>But you ask why did the war of the Mahabharat happen in a
civilization that had accepted the flute as its symbol? I say, this
happened in spite of Krishna’s flute. Krishna is not the cause of the
Mahabharat. There is no relationship whatsoever between the flute and
war. But there exists a logical relationship between the cross and
war.</p><p><br></p><p>The Mahabharat took place in spite of Krishna and his flute. It
simply means we are so attached to sorrow, so steeped in misery that
even Krishna’s flute fails to bring a ray of hope and joy to our hearts.
The flute continued to play, and we plunged into the vortex of war. The
flute could not change our sado-masochistic minds; Krishna’s flute could
not become our flute too.</p><p><br></p><p>It is interesting to know how difficult it is for someone to share in
another’s happiness. It is so easy to share in another’s sorrow. You can
easily cry with someone crying, but it is so hard to laugh with some one
laughing. You can easily sympathize with one whose house has been burned
down, but it is arduous to participate in the joys of one who has built
himself a beautiful new house. And it is not without some fundamental
reasons.</p><p><br></p><p>It is easy to come close to Jesus’ cross, because it strikes a note
of empathy in our hearts, which are already filled with pain and misery.
On the other hand Krishna’s flute will fill our hearts with envy and we
will escape from him. Krishna’s bliss will bring up envy in us; it will
not find an empathic response from our hearts.</p><p><br></p><p>Conversely, the cross will not make us jealous; it will certainly
bring up our empathy. The happiness of another creates jealousy, and
jealousy turns into misery. So to participate in another’s happiness is
really arduous.</p><p><br></p><p>It needs extraordinary intelligence to participate in another’s
happiness. To share in the joys of another, to make them one’s own is a
rare quality; it is of the highest. But to share in another’s sorrow is
not that difficult. It is so because we are ourselves burdened with
sorrow and suffering; we are already in misery. So we have no difficulty
in identifying ourselves with the suffering of others. But if someone is
happy we fail to connect with him for the simple reason that we don’t
know what happiness is, we are only unhappy in ourselves.</p><p>I repeat, the Mahabharat happens in spite of the flute. It is
interesting to note that after the advent of the cross it takes two
thousand years for war to grow to its present dimensions of a massive
war enveloping the whole earth, but the Mahabharat takes place even when
Krishna is playing his flute.</p><p><br></p><p>The truth is that the flute and its message is not rightly understood
and appreciated. It fails to make an impression on the sado-masochistic
minds of the people.</p><p><br></p><p>Another thing worth considering in this context is that Krishna
participates personally in the war. You cannot think of Jesus joining a
war of any kind. If someone suggests to him to do so, he will say, “Have
you gone mad? Don’t you know what I teach?” Jesus has said, “The
prophets of the past have said that if someone gouges out your one eye
you should take out his both, but I tell you if someone slaps you on the
tight cheek, turn to him the other one too. And I tell you if someone
takes your shirt, let him have your coat as well. And if someone asks
you to carry his bag one mile, go with him two miles – maybe out of
shyness he does not ask for more than a mile.” Now this person cannot be
goaded into fighting a war.</p><p><br></p><p>It looks somewhat paradoxical and complex that while Jesus refuses
even to resist evil, Krishna feels no compunction in leading a
destructive war like the Mahabharat. But the reason is obvious. For
Jesus, life is so miserable and meaningless that it is not worth
fighting for. For Krishna, on the other hand, life is so blissful that
even a war can be risked for it.</p><p><br></p><p>I would like to go into this matter rather deeply, because it is
significant for us and our times.</p><p><br></p><p>For Jesus, life as it is is so utterly miserable and meaningless that
a slap or two on the cheek will not add to its pile of miseries. It can
be said that his cup of suffering is so full that any more suffering
will not make a difference. So he turns his other cheek to you so you
don’t have to take the trouble of turning it yourself. He is already so
miserable that you cannot make him any more miserable.</p><p><br></p><p>For this reason, Jesus cannot be persuaded to take part in war. He
alone can agree to fight who declares that life is a blessing and not a
curse, that life is bliss and not suffering. He will stake everything to
defend the joy and bliss of life. He will do anything for the sake of
life.</p><p><br></p><p>Not only Jesus, even Mahavira and Buddha will not say yes to war.
Only Krishna is capable of doing it. If there is any other person in the
world of spiritualism and religion who can come near Krishna in this
respect, it is Mohammed. At some level, at some depth Mohammed is closer
to Krishna than others, although he cannot be fully with Krishna.</p><p><br></p><p>Whosoever feels that there is something precious and worthwhile in
life which needs to be preserved, to be fought for – he will join hands
with Krishna. For those who think otherwise, who see nothing in life
worth preserving, the question simply does not arise.</p><p><br></p><p>But remember, Krishna is not a warmonger. He is not a hawk, as some
pacifists would like to call him. He is a supporter of life, he stands
by life, and he will fight for it if need be. If the great values of
life – without which life would cease to be life – are in peril, Krishna
will not hesitate to defend them with missiles. Not that he relishes
violence or war, but if it becomes unavoidable he will not shirk the
responsibility.</p><p>That is why, from the beginning, he does everything to avoid the
Mahabharat. He leaves no stone unturned to avert war and save life and
peace. But when all his efforts for peace fail, he realizes that the
recalcitrant forces of death and destruction – forces that are against
righteousness and religion – are not amenable to an honorable peace. He
readies himself to fight on behalf of life and religion.</p><p><br></p><p>As I see it, life and religion are not two different things for
Krishna. And therefore he can fight as naturally as he can dance. It is
remarkable that a man like Krishna, even when he goes to the
battlefield, is happy and joyful; he never loses his bliss. And men like
Jesus are sad even as they keep a distance from the battlefield. Krishna
can be blissful even on the battlefield, because war comes to him as
part of life; it cannot be segregated from life.</p><p><br></p><p>As I said earlier, Krishna does not divide life into black and white,
good and evil, as the moralists and monks do. He does not subscribe to
the view that war is purely evil. He says that nothing is good or evil
under all circumstances. There are occasions when poison can work like
nectar and nectar can work like poison. There are moments when blessings
turn into curses and curses into blessings.</p><p><br></p><p>Nothing is certain for all time and space, under all circumstances.
The same thing can be good in one time and bad in another; it is really
determined by the moment at hand. Nothing can be predetermined and
prejudged. If someone does so. he is in for troubles in life, because
life is a flux where everything changes from moment to moment. So
Krishna lives in the moment; nothing is predetermined for him.</p><p><br></p><p>For long, Krishna does his best to avert war, but when he finds that
it is inescapable he accepts it without hesitation. He does not want
that one should go to war with a heavy heart, he does not believe in
doing anything reluctantly in fact. If war becomes inescapable he will
go to it with all his heart and mind.</p><p><br></p><p>With all his heart he tries to avert it, and when he fails, he goes
to war whole-heartedly. In the beginning of war, as you know, he has no
mind to take any active part in it. He tells Arjuna that he will not use
his particular weapon – sudarshan – on the battlefield, he will only
work as Arjuna’s charioteer. But then a moment comes when he takes the
sudarshan in his hand and becomes an active participant in the war.</p><p><br></p><p>As I said, Krishna lives in the moment; he lives moment to moment. In
fact, every blissful person lives in the moment; that is, he lives in a
timeless space.</p><p><br></p><p>But those who choose unhappiness and are pessimistic and miserable
cannot afford to live in the moment; they live in time, they have a
time-continuum. They have a long span of time – not chronological but
psychological – which extends both to the past and the future. And it is
this time- continuum that makes for their abiding misery and anguish.
They carry with them the heavy load of all the miseries of the dead past
– which is no more, and all the imagi-nable miseries of the endless
future – which is yet to come. So of course they feel crushed under the
dead weight of their psychological pain and agony.</p><p><br></p><p>On the other hand, a man of bliss does not accept the existence of
any other time except the present, the living moment. He has no past and
no future; for him the whole of existence is squeezed into the moment,
in the now. For him the moment is eternity itself, and he journeys from
one moment</p><p>through another. He dies totally to the past – which is not. And he
does not take into account the future – which is yet to come. For him
both past and future are non-existential. Such a person is fully
responsible to this moment. To be open to the living moment is his way
of life, his joy, his bliss.</p><p><br></p><p>A masochist, a seeker of pain and misery, is utterly blind to the
present, to the moment. He is closed in himself, like a cocoon; he is
not responsive to that which is. If you take him to a rosebush and say
to him, “Hey, man! Look at these blossoms, how enchanting they are!” he
will say, “What worth is this beauty which is going to wither away by
the evening?” Speak to him about the splendor of youth and his reaction
will be, “It is nothing; soon it will pass into old age and to the
grave.” About happiness he will say, “It is nothing more than a mirage,
an illusion; the more you chase it, the more distant it becomes. I am
not going to be deceived by it.” His mind is always set on time, the
future; he never lives in the moment.</p><p><br></p><p>A hedonist, on the other hand, lives totally in the moment. He is
finished with his past, and so he does not think of the future either,
which is psychologically nothing but a projection of the past. Coming to
a garden in bloom, the blissful person will be totally with the riot of
colors, he will dance and sing with the dancing flowers. And he will
tell the pessimist, “Why should I worry about the evening which is not
yet here, when even these flowers which are going to wither away are not
the least concerned about it? Look at them, how festive they are!”</p><p><br></p><p>And the wonder of wonders is that when the evening comes, the man of
bliss celebrates the withering of the flowers with the same enthusiasm
with which he had celebrated their blossoming in the morning. Who says
that only blooming flowers are enchanting? The withering ones are as
beautiful to look at! They are as beautiful as they were in the morning,
but our sorrow-filled eyes fail to perceive that beauty.</p><p><br></p><p>Who says only sunrise is beautiful? Sunset is not a whit less
beautiful. Who says only children are beautiful and not the old people?
Old age has its own beauty, its own grace. When a person like
Ravindranath or Walt Whitman, really grows into old age, his beauty is
immeasurable.</p><p><br></p><p>Looking at Walt Whitman in his old age, one feels to have come across
a beauty that cannot be surpassed. In fact, if childhood has a beauty of
its own, youth and old age each have some distinctive beauty which is no
less fascinating. When one’s hair becomes snow-white, when one is about
to complete his life’s journey, when one is loose and relaxed, he
radiates a beauty and grace that you find in the sunset. But a pessimist
cannot know it.</p><p><br></p><p>I repeat: a Krishna lives in the moment. The journey of bliss is the
journey of the moment. It is really wrong to call it a journey, because
you cannot travel in the moment; you can only drown in it. You can
travel in time, but in the moment you can only sink deeper and
deeper.</p><p><br></p><p>The way of the moment is vertical, it is not horizontal. The moment
has only depth, and no length at all; whereas time has only length, and
no depth at all. Therefore one who sinks into the moment transcends
time, he goes beyond time. One who reaches the timeless, achieves the
eternal. So Krishna is in the moment and eternity together. The moment
is eternity itself.</p><p><br></p><p>But one who lives in time can never know the eternal, because time is
a series, a continuity; it stretches from the dead past to an unborn and
unknown future. Time is tension, time is anxiety and</p><p>misery. One who lives in time does not live really, because all the
time he is either brooding over his past, which is gone forever, or he
is worrying about a future which is yet to be born. When it is morning
he is thinking of the evening; when he is alive he is worrying about
death. The moment he meets a loved one, he begins to grieve over the
separation that is going to happen in some future.</p><p><br></p><p>Krishna is accused of breaking promises he makes from time to time. A
moment comes in the battle of Mahabharat when he takes up arms, his
sudarshan chakra, although he had given his word that he would not take
an active part in the fighting, he would only act as Arjuna’s
charioteer.</p><p><br></p><p>In answer to the charge, Krishna would say, “The one who made the
promise is no more, nor is the moment which had brought forth the
promise.” He will ask, “Where is the Ganges that was there at the time
my promise was being made? Where are the flowers that had bloomed at
that moment? Where are those clouds that had glided through the sky when
I had given the assurance in question? Everything has changed,
everything has moved away since then. How can you bind me with that
moment which too is gone? I am now existing in the moment that is before
me, and I am responding to it totally.”</p><p><br></p><p>Krishna does not apologize for the so-called breach of promise, nor
does he regret it. He never repents; he never recants. He is true to the
moment.</p><p><br></p><p>What do I mean when I say he is true to the moment? He is so utterly
true to the existing moment that even if it confronts him with an
unthought-of eventuality he goes into it without flinching and as
totally as ever.</p><p><br></p><p>Of course, he will seem, at times, to be some what unfaithful to us,
to the conventional society, because he does not keep his promises. That
is the difficulty with a person like Krishna who is true to existence.
Such a person cannot be as true to the society he lives in – because
while the society lives in time, he lives in the timeless, in eternity.
The society has a past and a future to care for, while Krishna has none.
He is free, absolutely free,</p><p><br></p><p>A young man came to Rinzai, a celebrated Zen sage who lived in the
mountains. The young man said to Rinzai, “I am in search of truth, and
it is this search that has brought me to you from a long distance.”</p><p><br></p><p>Rinzai said to him, “Leave aside this matte of truth for the present.
I want to know something else from you since you are coming from Peking.
Can you say what is the price of rice in Peking?”</p><p><br></p><p>The youth was flabbergasted to hear such a question from a great
Master like Rinzai, who supposedly had nothing to do with such mundane
matters as the price of rice in Peking. He had made a long and arduous
journey in search of the highest. He had never imagined that a great
sage like Rinzai would talk about such a petty thing in place of
truth.</p><p><br></p><p>So the young man said to Rinzai, “Excuse me, sir, for my
impertinence. But I say it so you don’t ask any more questions like the
one before me. I don’t carry any past with me, I leave behind me the
paths that I travel, burn the bridges that I cross, pull down the stairs
that I climb. I die to the past totally, even to the minutes just gone
by.”</p><p>“Then sit down.” said Rinzai patting the youth’s back. “Now we will
talk about truth. I brought up the question of the price of rice only to
know if you yet carry your past with you. Had you remembered the price
of rice in Peking when you left it, I would have flatly refused to talk
about truth. One who clings to his past cannot come to truth, because
truth is always now and here, it is in the moment. Truth has nothing to
do with the past nor with the future. Truth is really timeless, and one
who lives in the past can never be in the present. Truth and time don’t
walk together.”</p><p><br></p><p>The Mahabharat happens in spite of Krishna. And yet Krishna becomes a
participant in the war, because a partisan of bliss can become a
partisan of war too. And Krishna believes that war is as much part of
life as peace is. One cannot be without the other. And war will be with
us as long as life exists on this earth. Maybe, the character of war
will change, its structure and shape will vary, its plane, strategy, and
style will be different, but war will continue.</p><p><br></p><p>It is impossible that war will ever disappear from the earth. It can
only disappear from the earth if man himself disappears from here. Or it
can disappear if man becomes perfect. Unless the human race as a whole
reaches its perfection, or becomes extinct as a species, there is no way
to abolish war. Man as he is cannot do without war. War has always been
with us; it is with us now, and it is going to be with us in the future.
Then what is the problem in regard to war.</p><p><br></p><p>Krishna’s answer to this question is, war should be righteous, it
should be waged for the highest values of life like freedom and
truth.</p><p><br></p><p>In the same way, peace needs to be righteous. Remember, some kinds of
peace can be unrighteous, irreligious, and war can be made to uphold
religion and truth.</p><p><br></p><p>The pacifist thinks that peace is always righteous, and the warmonger
thinks that war is right in every case. Krishna is neither a partisan of
peace nor of war; he really has no “isms.” He is not bound to any
ideology, he is liquid like water. He is never stagnant, he is always
moving with life. He is not solid and immobile like a rock; he is fluid
like air. So he says, “Peace can be evil too.”</p><p><br></p><p>For example, a pacifist who is religiously committed to peace is
passing a street where someone is being robbed. He can say that he has
nothing to do with others’ feuds and strifes, and he refuses to
interfere in the matter, going peacefully on his way. This peace is
irreligious, because it is indirectly helping someone rob another person
who may be innocent and helpless. It is not necessary that peace is
right in every case. Men like Bertrand Russell think that peace is
always right, it is inviolable. But he is only being dogmatic about
peace.</p><p><br></p><p>Sometimes cowardice and impotence can take shelter behind the facade
of peace. Krishna tells Arjuna again and again, “Give up
faint-heartedness, O Arjuna. I had never thought that you could be as
unmanly and impotent as your words reveal you to be. When war faces you,
war that forces of unrighteousness have unleashed, it does not become
you to talk like a coward. Where is your manliness, your skill?”</p><p><br></p><p>Peace is not necessarily righteous, nor is war unrighteous. It
depends on the conditions that bring the forces of peace and war into
play. But then you can say that warmongers are right in claiming that
war is righteous. They can claim so, and nobody can prevent them. Life
is very complex. But they will find it increasingly difficult to make
such a claim if understanding grows among the people of what religion
is.</p><p>Let me explain to you what religion and irreligion are according to
Krishna. That which helps life grow, flower and dance ecstatically is
religion. And that which impedes life’s growth, which distorts and
stifles life’s flowering, which smothers life’s joy and festivity is
irreligion. Irreligion is what blocks and suffocates life; religion is
what helps it to come to its fulfillment.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2</p><p><br></p><p>QUESTIONER: WHO HAS EVER UNDERSTOOD AND IMBIBED KRISHNA RIGHTLY? WHAT
SHOULD ONE DO TO IMBIBE HIM? CAN YOU GIVE AN OUTLINE OF HUMAN
CIVILIZATION AND CULTURE PATTERNED ON. KRISHNA’S LIFE AND TEACHINGS?</p><p><br></p><p>How can one imbibe another? How can one take after Krishna or anyone
else? And why? Is it incumbent on me to imbibe another, become like
another? I can only imbibe and be myself, not Krishna.</p><p><br></p><p>Krishna does not pattern himself after another. He imbibes himself
and remains himself. Why should another try to pattern himself after
Krishna, to be like him? It is enough that I imbibe myself and am
totally myself. No, to imbibe another, to be like another, is the worst
kind of corruption, and it is the greatest injustice that someone can do
to himself.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole idea of imitation is mistaken and wrong. I have my own soul
which should come to its full flowering. What will happen to it, to my
own soul if I imbibe another and copy him? It is true, I can impose
another’s personality on myself, which can overpower me, but what will
happen to me, to my own being? I owe a responsibility to myself, and if
I become like someone else I will be betraying myself.</p><p><br></p><p>No, it is enough if one understands Krishna. Trying to be like him is
utterly uncalled for. Understanding is enough. And one should understand
him, not with a view to imbibe and imitate him, to be his carbon-copy,
but to understand himself and be himself.</p><p><br></p><p>You certainly have to know how a person like Krishna is fulfilled and
also know the laws of this fulfillment. You certainly have to understand
how Krishna attains to his naturalness and spontaneity, so that you can
come to your own naturalness and spontaneity. Krishna’s life can give
you a cue, a clue to know yourself and come to yourself. If Krishna can
flower, why not you? If Krishna’s self- nature can blossom, why should
you go on withering and wasting as you do? If Krishna can laugh and sing
and dance, why should you continue to shed tears and be miserable?</p><p><br></p><p>It is not that you will dance the way Krishna dances. Your dance will
be different, it will be your own; you will uncover your own innate
dance. You don’t have to copy Krishna’s dance, you have only to know the
law that helped him to find his dance and be fulfilled. Krishna’s life
can help you in self discovery, which is of the highest. Self discovery,
and not assimilation or imitation, is what you have to seek. And
Krishna’s life can be of tremendous help in this adventure.</p><p><br></p><p>So the first thing to know is that no one can be your ideal, not even
Krishna. And you need not follow and imitate another, Krishna
included.</p><p><br></p><p>It is true that any number of people have wasted their lives
following and imitating others. In reality, no one can wholly succeed in
becoming like another; it is impossible. You can impose another’s</p><p>personality on yourself, wear his mask and look like him, but you
cannot make your very soul into him. Do what you can, you cannot
succeed; at best you can enact him, but it will not be more than acting.
Being cannot be borrowed; it is always one’s own. In spite of all
efforts, you will remain what you innately are.</p><p><br></p><p>Imitation is dangerous in many ways. To imitate someone you have to
suppress yourself, suppress your individuality, your self-nature. And
this suppression can be so deep that you will lose all con tact with
yourself – which is the worst thing that can happen to any individual.
Although you will yet survive at your innermost core as yourself, you
will now be far removed from yourself. That is the problem.</p><p><br></p><p>Millions of people down the ages have tried to imitate Krishna,
Buddha, Christ and others, but none has succeeded so far. Success is
impossible. Five thousand years have passed since Krishna happened, but
there has not been a second Krishna in all history. Twenty-five hundred
years have passed after Buddha, and there has not yet been another
Buddha. Nor has there been another Zarathustra, Jesus, or Mohammed.</p><p><br></p><p>Whosoever tries to imitate others is destined to court failure. It is
really worse than failure, it is disaster, it is suicide. Even as
suicide it is the worst kind. In ordinary suicide, as we know, only
one’s physical form is destroyed. In this suicide the very soul is
sought to be destroyed. So all followers, all disciples, all imitators
are suicidal.</p><p><br></p><p>Many people try to imitate Krishna, and in the process they not only
injure themselves but they also injure Krishna. If you copy Krishna, you
will, with all your efforts, make yourself a caricature of him. And this
thing will not only distort you, but it will also distort Krishna’s
image. You will imitate him in your own way, and to that extent you will
distort him, you will adulterate him.</p><p><br></p><p>So you are not only insulting and abusing yourself, but you are also
insulting and abusing Krishna. So this imitation is really outrageous.
All theologians, all priests – whether they follow Krishna or Christ –
are guilty of this crime. And they all tell the same story – the story
of man’s failure to be himself, the story of man’s attempts at
suicide.</p><p><br></p><p>But we cannot say the same thing about Meera and Chaitanya. They are
a class by themselves, and they are certainly no imitators. Through
understanding Krishna’s ways of expressing himself, his self nature,
Meera and Chaitanya express themselves as they are; they reveal their
own distinctive self natures. They don’t impose Krishna on themselves,
nor do they ape his lifestyle, his demeanor, his songs and dances. They
sing their own songs; they dance their own dances.</p><p><br></p><p>So Meera remains Meera and Chaitanya re mains Chaitanya. Of course
they carry with them their love of Krishna, and as this love grows
Chaitanya and Meera disappear as egos. As this love grows even Krishna
disappears and only love remains. If you ask Chaitanya if he is
Chaitanya or Krishna in that moment, he will say, “I really don’t know
who I am; I even don’t know if I am.” In this moment even the “I”
disappears, and only an “am-ness” remains. This is pure existence. And
this achievement of Chaitanya is the flowering and fruition of his own
self-nature. There is nothing of imitation about it,</p><p><br></p><p>We are all prone to imitate others. And there is a good reason for
it. Imitation is like ready-made garments: buy and wear garments. You
don’t have to do a thing, not even to wait for them. It suits our
easygoing minds which want everything gratuitously.</p><p>To explore ant find one’s own innate being is arduous, to imitate
Krishna is easy enough. It takes time to be oneself, but imitation comes
in handy, Self nature, self-fulfillment, has to be earned, borrow ing is
effortless, convenient.</p><p><br></p><p>But this pursuit of convenience is disastrous; it really lands one
into the very vortex of sorrow and misery. So never commit the mistake
of imitating others; it is utterly disastrous. It is calamitous.</p><p><br></p><p>I call him a religious person who goes on a voyage of self-discovery,
who really discovers himself. In this adventure of self-discovery,
understanding Krishna or Mahavira, Buddha or Jesus, can be helpful.
Because in understanding others we lay the foundation of self-knowledge
which is central to spiritualism. Instead of knowing oneself directly,
it is easier to know through knowing others, because others provide you
with a distance, a perspective to know.</p><p><br></p><p>Because there is a lack of distance between the knower and the known,
direct self-knowledge is really arduous. So in understanding oneself,
the other is helpful. But when you go to understand another – Krishna,
Buddha or Mahavira – remember, he is only a means to self understanding
and self discovery. He is not your goal.</p><p><br></p><p>You might have observed on many occasions that when somebody comes to
consult you about a complex problem of his own, you advise him so
competently. But when it comes to your own problem, even a simple
problem, you begin to shake in your shoes.</p><p><br></p><p>What is the matter? You are considered to be a very wise man by many
who rush to you in their hours of difficulty for your sage advice, and
you have the reputation of solving many of their problems. But when you
are yourself in a mess you rush to others – perhaps to those very people
you have helped – for their advice. The reason is that you are so close
to your problem, you are so involved in it, that you can’t have the
perspective to correctly figure it out.</p><p><br></p><p>It is comparatively easy to understand others and if we see others as
a medium for self- understanding then the lives of men like Krishna and
Buddha are of immense value. Then as we grow in self-understanding,
Krishna and Christ, Mahavira and Buddha will drop by the wayside and we
will be left with ourselves in our utter purity.</p><p><br></p><p>This purity of the self, this virginity, this un spoiled innocence is
what matters. And attainment of this innocence, purity, is freedom. This
ultimate purity or aloneness is called nirvana or ultimate liberation.
This primeval innocence is called Krishna consciousness or God or what
you will.</p><p><br></p><p>One who reaches this supreme state of being with the help of Krishna
will say that he has attained to Krishna. This is a way of repaying an
old debt that he owes to Krishna, this is a way of expressing one’s
gratitude to him. One who attains to this ultimate state with the help
of Buddha, will say that he has attained Buddhahood. He is only
expressing his gratitude to one whose life and teachings helped him in
his arduous journey of self-discovery.</p><p><br></p><p>Ultimately, every seeker – whether he walks with Krishna or Christ –
discovers himself. He cannot discover the other, because the other is
not. The day I find myself, when I know who I am, the other, the “thou”
ceases to be. But I will need some name to describe my experience, and
certainly I will use one which helped me in coming to myself, in coming
home.</p><p>One last thing, and then we will sit for meditation. Question 3</p><p>QUESTIONER: A PART OF THE QUESTION YET REMAINS TO BE ANSWERED. PLEASE
GIVE US AN OUTLINE OF HUMAN CIVILIZATION AND CULTURE PATTERNED ON
KRISHNA’S LIFE AND TEACHING.</p><p><br></p><p>It will need a lengthy answer. All these days, however, I have been
doing the same thing – drawing an outline of human civilization
reflecting Krishna’s vision. Yet I would like to say a few things in
this regard.</p><p><br></p><p>Human civilization, according to Krishna’s vision, will be
life-affirmative and natural in the first place. This is my vision too,
that affirmation of life and nature should be the cornerstone of human
civilization if it wants to be healthy and holistic. Such a civilization
will be dedicated to the moment, to bliss and to celebration.</p><p><br></p><p>This civilization will refuse to be life negative, renunciatory,
masochistic and time-oriented. It will reject all fragmentation of life.
Life will be accepted as a blessing, and there will be no division
whatsoever, between life and God.</p><p><br></p><p>This civilization will declare that life is God, and there is no
other God in opposition to life or separate from life. That life itself
is God will be the overall truth of man. This man will declare there is
no creator other than creation; creativity itself is God.</p><p><br></p><p>This summing up will be clear to you if you take it in the context of
the whole discussion we have had here for these ten days. During these
days I said many things, some of which might have pleased you and some
others which might have displeased you. But remember, both pleasant and
unpleasant feelings come in the way of right understanding. Without
trying to understand, we gullibly accept that which is pleasant and
reject off-hand all that is unpleasant. I don’t want you either to
accept or to reject; all I want is that you should understand simply,
effortlessly, and naturally.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t want that you should collect my words and take them home.
That will not be worthwhile. What is worthwhile then? If in the course
of listening to my words, some understanding, some wisdom has dawned on
you – and it that understanding, that wisdom is really worthwhile, then
it will go with you naturally, effortlessly.</p><p><br></p><p>It is like you visit a garden full of flowers and fragrance, and when
you leave it, the garden is left behind but some of its fragrance goes
with you – clinging in your nostrils, in your hair, in your clothes. So
leave the flowers of words behind and take their essence, if you have
gathered it, with you.</p><p><br></p><p>My words are as useless as all words are, but if in your encounter
with them something has clicked in your being it is certainly of great
significance.</p><p><br></p><p>My words, or any words for that matter, can have significance if you
listen to them with an open mind, an unprejudiced and empty mind,
without judging them, without identifying with them or condemning them.
They can give rise to some understanding of wisdom in you if you listen
without saying, “This is right and that is wrong. That is what I believe
too, and that is what is against my belief.”</p><p>If you think that I am for Krishna and against Mahavira or whoever is
your favorite, you will only earn unhappiness, and not understanding.
But I will not be responsible for your sorrow; nor will Krishna or
Mahavira. The responsibility will be entirely yours. Even if you happily
think that I am in support of Krishna, who is your favored avatara or
incarnation of God, you have missed me, you will remain as ignorant as
you were when you came here.</p><p><br></p><p>I have nothing to do with Krishna: I am neither for him nor against
him. I have unfolded his life and teachings exactly as I see them, and I
am not concerned with what you think about it.</p><p><br></p><p>And remember, I live in the moment, I live moment to moment; I am not
at all predictable or dependable. From what I say today one should not
and cannot infer what I am going to say tomorrow. What I say today is
exactly how I see it today. And what I will say tomorrow will be exactly
how I see it tomorrow. And what you understand while listening to me
today or any day is not important. But if this listening adds to your
understanding, your intelligence, it has done its work. Understanding is
important, all-important.</p><p><br></p><p>I hope these ten days have helped you grow in understanding, in
clarity, and in some degree opened you to the sun of life and truth. I
don’t say by what name – Krishna or Buddha or Christ – you should call
him when that sun of understanding comes to you.</p><p><br></p><p>I say this much: that if your mind is uncluttered and empty, if your
heart is vulnerable and your perception is clear, there is no doubt
whatsoever that the sun will rise and you will see light, you will be
illumined. What you will call it will depend on you. The sun will not
come saying, “I am so and so”; he is really without a name.</p><p><br></p><p>But remember, he alone has an open heart mind who lives with
understanding, who lives in understanding, who lives without ideas and
ideals, concepts and beliefs, creeds, doctrines and dogmas. He alone is
vulnerable to life and truth who is not a partisan of some belief-system
like Hinduism Catholicism or communism.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, ideas and concepts, doctrines and dogmas are meant for those
who have no intelligence and understanding of their own. They go to the
market of ready-made ideologies and philosophies and buy them from
theologians, priests and philosophers by mortgaging their own minds.
Understanding is like a river – fluid and alive and flowing. All
philosophies and theologies, all doctrines and dogmas are like
stagnating pools of water, dead and stinking.</p><p><br></p><p>So if you have listened to me through the screen of your thoughts and
beliefs – it makes no difference whether you are their partisans or
enemies – you have not listened to me at all. Then you will never
understand that which I have said.</p><p><br></p><p>The last thing that I have to say is this: I have nothing to do with
Krishna; I have no relationship with him. I am not for him or against
him; neither have I intention of converting you into his partisans or
enemies. I have used Krishna exactly as a painter uses a canvas. The
painter has nothing more to do with the canvas than to express himself
through some colors daubed on it. I too had a few colors to spread on
Krishna’s canvas, and I am finished with it. Even Mahavira’s or Buddha’s
canvas would have served my purpose.</p><p>And it is not necessary for me that I should use the same kind of
colors on every canvas; nor am I committed to create the same kind of
portraits on every canvas. I am free to express myself the way I am, and
in the way I choose to express. If I am a real painter, I will create a
different kind of painting, even a contradictory painting, each time I
take paint and brush in my hands. He is only an imitator who repeats the
same work again and again.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not necessary that you should cling rigidly to my statements.
It is enough that you understand them and move ahead of them, You should
leave the statements and live with their understanding, their
essence.</p><p><br></p><p>If you do so you will not ever be in danger of clinging to my words.
It will do me no harm if you cling to them, but it will certainly harm
you immensely, because when one clings to some person or idea or thing,
he immediately loses himself. And when one is free of all clingings and
attachments, when one is utterly empty, he is immediately filled with
himself, with the eternal, or God, or call it what you will.</p><p><br></p><p>It is with this hope that I talked to you these few days sitting in
the lap of the Himalayas. I am grateful to you for having listened to me
with such love, patience and peace, and I bow to God sitting inside each
one of you.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part20>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

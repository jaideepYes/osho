‌CHAPTER 1
The Future Belongs to Krishna
20 July 1970 pm in C.C.I. Chambers
Question 1
QUESTIONER: WHAT ARE THE DISTINGUISHING VIRTUES OF KRISHNA THAT MAKE HIM RELEVANT TO OUR TIME? WHAT IS HIS SIGNIFICANCE FOR US? PLEASE EXPLAIN.
Krishna is utterly incomparable, he is so unique. Firstly, his uniqueness lies in the fact that although Krishna happened in the ancient past he belongs to the future, is really of the future.</description>

Spiritualism, Religion and Politics
30 September 1970 am in
Question 1
QUESTIONER: KRISHNA WAS ESSENTIALLY A SPIRITUAL MAN, BUT HE FREELY TOOK PART IN POLITICS. AND AS A POLITICIAN HE DID NOT SHRINK FROM USING THE TRICKS OF THE TRADE. IN THE BATTLE OF THE MAHABHARAT HE GOT BISHMA KILLED BY DECEIT – A NAKED WOMAN WAS MADE TO STAND BEFORE THAT VENERATED OLD SAGE, WHO WAS A VOWED CELIBATE.</description>

Draupadi: A Rare Woman
30 September 1970 pm in
Question 1
QUESTIONER: DRAUPADI, WHO IS ALSO KNOWN AS KRISHNAA, HAS BEEN SUBJECTED TO HARSH CRITICISM AND DETRACTION, BUT KRISHNA LOVES HER TREMENDOUSLY. PLEASE SAY SOMETHING ABOUT HER IN THE CONTEXT OF OUR OWN TIME.
As among men Krishna baffles our understanding, so does Draupadi among women. and how the critics look at Draupadi says more about the critics themselves than about Draupadi.</description>

QUESTIONER: WE HAVE HAD THE RARE OPPORTUNITY OF LISTENING TO YOU SPEAK ON KRISHNA’S MULTI-SPLENDORED LIFE – HIS RAAS, HIS FLUTE, HIS RADHA AND HIS UNIQUE WEAPON, THE SUDARSHAN. WE WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM YOU TODAY SOMETHING ABOUT HIS PHILOSOPHY, THE SPIRITUAL DISCIPLINE AND THE WAY OF WORSHIP THAT HE TAUGHT TO DISPEL THE DELUSION OF A SINGLE PERSON, ARJUNA.</description>

Krishna Goes to the West
1 October 1970 pm in
Question 1
QUESTIONER: YOU HAVE SAID ONE CAN ENCOUNTER KRISHNA’ SOUL ANY TIME, BECAUSE IT IS EVERLASTING, NOTHING IN EXISTENCE DIES. IF SO, WHAT SHOULD ONE DO TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE? AND TELL US IF ONE CAN ATTAIN TO FULL DEVOTION THROUGH CONCENTRATION ON KRISHNA’S ICON AND CHANTING HIS NAME AND HYMNS OF HIS PRAISE.</description>

2 October 1970 am in
Question 1
QUESTIONER: YOU SAY THAT ON KRISHNA’S PATH SELF-REMEMBERING IS ENOUGH; IT DOES NOT LEAVE ROOM FOR ANY OTHER SPIRITUAL DISCIPLINE. BUT SINCE YOU ALSO SPEAK ABOUT DISCIPLINING THE SEVEN BODIES, CAN YOU GIVE US A BRIEF SKETCH OF KRISHNA’S DISCIPLINE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE SEVEN BODIES?
There is no place in Krishna’s philosophy for any spiritual discipline, so the question of disciplining the seven bodies does not arise.</description>

QUESTIONER: A PART OF OUR PREVIOUS QUESTION REMAINS UNANSWERED: IT IS ABOUT SHREE ARVIND SEEING VISIONS OF KRISHNA. YOU HAD ONCE SAID AT AHMEDABAD THAT SUCH VISIONS ARE MOSTLY NOTHING MORE THAN MENTAL PROJECTIONS. IS IT A MENTAL PROJECTION OR A REAL MYSTICAL EXPERIENCE IN THE CASE OF ARVIND?</description>

BUT OUR DIFFICULTY IS THAT YOUR ENERGY IS SO POWERFUL THAT WE CANNOT KEEP PACE WITH YOU.

BUT IT IS SO DIFFICULT FOR ORDINARY MEN AND WOMEN TO BE FREE OF DESIRING AND ATTACHMENT. PLEASE EXPLAIN THE SIGNIFICANCE OF DESIRELESSNESS AND NON-ATTACHMENT AND WAYS TO ACHIEVE THEM.</description>

BUT THE GEETA ATTACHES SPECIAL IMPORTANCE TO JAPA-YAJNA AND JNANA-YAJNA – THE RITUALS OF CHANTING AND KNOWLEDGE. TALKING ABOUT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF JAPA OR CHANTING, YOU MENTIONED AJAPA OR WORDLESS CHANTING.</description>

Question 1 QUESTIONER:
WHAT IS THE SUBTLE DIFFERENCE, IF ANY, BETWEEN MAHAVIRA’S TRANSCENDENCE OF ATTACHMENT, CHRIST’S HOLY INDIFFERENCE, BUDDHA’S INDIFFERENCE AND KRISHNA’S NON-ATTACHMENT? AND IN WHAT WAY ARE THEY THE SAME?
There is a good deal of similarity between Christ’s concept of neutrality, Buddha’s idea of indifference, Mahavira’s transcendence of attachment, and Krishna’s non-attachment.</description>

Question 1
QUESTIONER: SPEAKING IN THE CONTEXT OF KRISHNA AND JESUS, YOU OBSERVED, “THE CIVILIZATION THAT BEGAN WITH THE CROSS HAD TO END UP IN AN ATOMIC WAR, AND THEREFORE THE MODERN CIVILIZATION IS FACED WITH A CHOICE BETWEEN THE CROSS AND THE FLUTE.” BUT EH QUESTION IS THAT THE CIVILIZATION THAT BEGAN WITH THE FLUTE ALSO ENDED UP IN A WAR – THE WAR OF MAHABHARAT.</description>

Sannyas is of the Highest
28 September 1970 pm in
September 28, 1970 was a memorable day. At Manali in the Himalayas, Osho initiated His first group of sannyasins. This event was followed by this special evening discourse, on the significance of Neo Sannyas.
To me, sannyas does not mean renunciation; it means a journey to joy bliss. To me, sannyas is not any kind of negation; it is a positive attainment.</description>

Question 1
QUESTIONER: THROUGHOUT THE GEETA KRISHNA APPEARS TO BE UTTERLY EGOISTIC, BUT THIS MORNING YOU SAID IT WAS BECAUSE OF HIS EGOLESSNESS THAT KRISHNA ASKED ARJUNA TO SURRENDER TO HIM, GIVING UP EVERYTHING ELSE. BUT BUDDHA AND MAHAVIRA DON’T SAY THIS TO THEIR DISCIPLES. SO IS THERE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEIR KINDS OF EGOLESSNESS?</description>

Question 1
QUESTIONER: PLEASE EXPLAIN THE SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH KRISHNA WAS BORN. AND IS THERE SOME ANALOGY BETWEEN KRISHNA AND CHRIST IN REGARD TO THEIR BIRTHS?
Whether it is the birth of Krishna or Christ, or anybody else, it does not make a great difference. But we have always made a distinction between one birth and another, because of our failure to understand the meaning of some symbols of birth as given in mythology.</description>

QUESTIONER: YOU SAY THAT MARRIAGE IS IMMORAL. AND HERE IS KRISHNA WHO PERHAPS GOES FOR THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF MARRIAGES IN HISTORY. IS HE GUILTY OF ENCOURAGING THE IMMORALITY WHICH MARRIAGE IS?
I say marriage is immoral, but I don’t say marrying is immoral. A man and a woman in love with each other would like to live together, so a marriage stemming from love will not be immoral.</description>

HE KILLED THE TYRANT KIND KANSA AND DESTROYED DEMONS LIKE KIRTI, AGHA, BAKA AND GHOTAKA; IN A DUEL HE DEFEATED POWERFUL WRESTLERS LIKE CHANOOR AND MUSTIKA.

QUESTIONER: HOW IS IT THAT KRISHNA IS CALLED A CELIBATE IN SPITE OF HIS BEING A MAN OF JOYOUS DANCE AND SENSUOUS CELEBRATION? WHAT IS THE PLACE AND RELEVANCE OF RAASLEELA – THE DANCE OF CELEBRATION – IN MODERN SOCIETY?
To understand raasleela, the dance of celebration, what is first necessary to know is that the whole of life is a meeting of contradictory forces, and that all its happiness comes from this union of the opposites.</description>

AND HERE IS KRISHNA WHO PERHAPS GOES FOR THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF MARRIAGES IN HISTORY. IS HE GUILTY OF ENCOURAGING THE IMMORALITY WHICH MARRIAGE IS?\nI say marriage is immoral, but I don’t say marrying is immoral. A man and a woman in love with each other would like to live together, so a marriage stemming from love will not be immoral. But we are doing just the contrary; we are trying to squeeze love from marriage, which is not possible. Marriage is a bondage, and love is freedom. But a couple in love would like to live together, which is natural. This togetherness will flow from love. Marriage should be the shadow of love and not otherwise.\nI don’t say that after the abolition of marriage a man and a woman will not live together. The truth is, only then will they really live together. At the moment they only seem to be living together, they really don’t live together. Mere physical togetherness is not togetherness. Living in close proximity in space is not living together. And just to be coupled in marriage is not really coupling, not true union.\nIt is the institution of marriage which I call immoral. The institution of marriage would like love to be banished from the world. As such, every institution is unnatural: it is against man’s natural feelings and emotions; it cannot exist without suppressing them. When any two people fall in love with each other, their love is unique and incomparable; no other two people have ever loved each other the same way. But when two persons get married, that marriage is very ordinary, commonplace, millions\nof people have known marriage the same way. Love is an original and unique phenomenon, while marriage is just a tradition, a repetition. A marriage strangles and kills love. As the institution of marriage becomes dominant and powerful, it thwarts and throttles love to the same degree.\nThe day we accord love its priority in our lives; the day a man and a woman live together not by way of a contract and compromise but out of love and love alone, marriage as we know it will cease to exist. And with marriage will go today’s system of divorce. Then a couple will live together for the sake of their love and happiness. and for no other consideration, and they will part company and separate when the love between them dries up and disappears. Society will not come in their way in any manner.\nI repeat: marriage as an institution is immoral, and marriage that comes in the wake of love is quite natural. There is nothing immoral about it.\nQuestion 2\nQUESTIONER: WHAT WILL BE THE POSITION OF CHILDREN IN A MARRIAGE WHICH HIS LOVE AS ITS BASIS? WHERE WILL THEY BELONG? AND WILL THEY NOT BECOME A SOCIAL PROBLEM? PLEASE EXPLAIN.\nSo many problems seem to loom up if love becomes the basis of marriage. But they loom up only because we see things through the screen of our old concepts and beliefs. The day we accord love its highest value, the idea that children belong to individuals, to parents, will become meaningless. Really, children don’t belong to individuals; they really never belong to them. There was a time when the father was un. known, only the mother was known. That was the age of matriarchy, when the mother was the head of the family and descent was reckoned through the female line.\nYou will be surprised to know the word “father” is not that old; the word “uncle” is much older. “Mother” is an ancient word, while “father” is very new. The father really appeared on the scene when we institutionalized marriage; he was not known before. The whole male population of a tribe was father-like; only the mother of a child was known. The whole tribe was loving to its children, and since they belonged to none they belonged to all.\nIt is not right to say that ownership of children by individuals, by parents, has been good for children. True good will happen when children belong to a whole commune or society.\nYou ask what the position of children will be when we will make love the basis of marriage. Will not they become a social problem? No, they will not be a social problem then. They are a social problem tight now, when we have left them at the mercy of a few individuals, be they parents or relations. And in view of the new vista of future possibilities opening up before us, it is certain that the old foundations of our society are not going to last any longer.\nFor instance, in the old world a father was a must for a child to be born, it will not be so in the future. In fact, he has already become redundant. Now my sperm can be preserved for thousands of years after my death. and it can give birth to a chill even ten thousand years after me.\nThen in the future, even the mother, who has so far been so indispensable, will not be needed for the birth of a child. Soon science is going to find ways and means – we are at the doorstep of its\nconsummation – when a mother will not need to carry the burden of a baby in her womb for nine months. A machine, an instrument like the test tube will do the job better. All the facilities that are available to a baby in the mother’s womb will be provided to him, and he will be better provided for in a test tube or whatever we will call it. And then it will be difficult to know the parentage of a child. Then the whole social structure will have to be changed. Then all women will play mothers and all men will play fathers to children who will grow up under the collective care of the community. For sure, everything is going to change.\nWhat I am saying has become necessary because of the way science is currently developing throughout the world. But we don’t understand it because we continue to think in out old ways, which are out of date. Now when a child is born to you, you consult the best possible physician about his health and upkeep; you don’t think that, being his father or mother, you can treat your child medically too. In the same way you go to a good tailor to have clothes made for him; you don’t sew them yourself because you happen to be his parent. Likewise, with the deepening of your understanding you will want your child to be born with the help of much healthier sperm than your own, so that he is not retarded physically or mentally, so that he is endowed with a healthy body and an intelligent mind. So you would want to secure the best sperm available for the birth of your child.\nOn her part, a would-be mother would not like to drag on for nine months with a baby in her womb when facilities will be made available to grow a child externally in a better and healthier manner. The function of parents, as it is today, will then cease to be necessary. And with the cessation of the function of parents, how will marriage itself exist? Then the very basis of marriage will disappear. Technology on one hand and the science of man’s mind on the other, are heading towards a point when individual claim on children will come to an end.\nThis does not mean that all man’s problems will end with this radical change in the social structure. Every new experiment, every change we make brings its own problems with it. It is not a great question that problems as such should cease to be – man will always have problems – the great question is that we should have newer and greater problems to deal with than what we now have. The real question is that our problems of today should be better than those we had yesterday.\nIt is not that with the abolition of marriage every conflict between man and man, between man and woman will disappear for good. But, for sure, the conflicts that arise from marriage – and they are more than enough – will go. However, newer conflicts and newer problems will arise and it will be a joy to deal with them. To live on this planet problems will always be needed, because it is through our struggle with problems that we grow and mature.\nIn this connection it is necessary to take notice of a particular problem which comes our way again and again. The problem is that we get used to putting up with the problems of the social system we are given to live in. And so we are afraid of facing those new and unfamiliar problems that are likely to come with a better and higher social system – even if such a system becomes necessary and feasible. And thus we get stuck with a decadent and dying system, and that is what makes for our real difficulty, our real problem. But it is the task of intelligence to understand that if newer and better problems are available, in the wake of change, it is right to go for the change and to grapple with those problems and solve them.\nI hold that so long as love does not bloom fully in a man’s life he will not attain to the glory and grandeur of life, he will remain lackluster. A life devoid of love is dull and dreary; it is a veritable\ndesert. And I think that a life full of problems, full of energy and glow, is far more preferable to a life that is dull, dreary and dead. I would like to conclude this discussion with a small anecdote.\nA little bunch of wildflowers lived sheltered in the crevices of an old city wall. Winds and storms failed to disturb them since they were well protected by the high wall and its crevices. For the same reason, the sun’s rays could not burn them nor could the rains ruin them.\nThere was a rosebush in the neighborhood of this little bunch of wildflowers. The presence of gorgeous roses made the wildflowers feel inferior and ashamed of their own existence. So one fine morning the wildflowers prayed to God, “So long we have lived as faceless flowers; now please turn us into roses.”\nGod said in answer, “Why get into unnecessary troubles? The life of a rose is very hard. When there is a storm, it shakes it to its roots. And when it blooms, there is already someone around to pluck it. You live a well-protected life, don’t forsake it.”\nBut the wildflowers insisted, “We have long lived a sheltered life; we now want to live dangerously. Please make us roses for twenty-four hours.”\nOther wildflowers pleaded, “Don’t be crazy. We have heard that a few of our ancestors had to suffer terribly because of this very craze to become a rose. Our racial experience says we are okay as we are, we should not try to be roses.’l\nBut the little plant again said, “I want to gossip with the stars; I want to fight with the storms; I W Int to bathe in the rains. I am determined to become a rose.”\nAt long last God yielded and one fine morning the little bunch of wildflowers became a rose. And immediately its saga of trials and tribulations began. Storms came and shook its roots. Rains came and it was drowned in water. The midday sun burned its petals and made it suffer immeasurably. At all times it was exposed to dangers from all sides. Once again other elderly wildflowers gathered round the newborn rose and said, “We had told you so; you did not listen. Don’t you see how secure you were in your old life? Granted it had its problems, but they were old and familiar problems, and we were used to them. It was okay. Do you see what a mess you have made of your life?”\nTo this the new rose said, “You are fools. I say that it is far better to be a rose just for twenty-four hours and live dangerously than to live in lifelong security as little wildflowers protected by a high wall. It was great to breathe with the storms and fight with the winds. I was in contact with the sun and I had a dialogue with the stars. I have achieved my soul and I am so fulfilled. I lived fully and I am going to die fully. As far as you are concerned you live a life of living death.”\nBut going back to the world does not make any difference to Krishna: he can easily go back if it becomes necessary. He will remain himself in every situation – in love and attachment, in anger and hostility. Nothing will disturb his emptiness, his calm. He will find no difficulty whatsoever is coming and going. His emptiness is positive and complete, alive and dynamic.\nBut so far as experiencing it is concerned it is the same whether you come to Buddha’s emptiness or Krishna’s. Both will take you into bliss. But where Buddha’s emptiness will bring you relaxation\nand rest, maybe Krishna’s emptiness will lead you to immense action. If we can coin a phrase like “active void”, it will appropriately describe Krishna’s emptiness. And the emptiness of Buddha and Mahavira should be called “passive void”. Bliss is common to both but with one difference: the bliss of the active void will be creative and the other kind of bliss will dissolve itself in the great void.\nYou can ask one more question, after which we will sit for meditation. Question 3\nQUESTIONER: HOW IS IT THAT BUDDHA LIVES FOR FORTY YEARS AFTER ATTAINING NIRVANA OR THE GREAT EMPTINESS?\nIt is true Buddha lives for forty to forty-two years after he becomes Buddha. Mahavira also lives about the same period of time. But Buddha makes a difference between nirvana and nirvana. Just before leaving his body he says that what he had attained under the bodhi tree was just nirvana, emptiness, and what he is now going to attain will be mahanirvana or supreme emptiness. In his first nirvana Buddha achieves the emptiness we can see, but his second emptiness, his mahanirvana, is such that we cannot see it. Of course men like Krishna and Buddha can see it.\nIt is true that Buddha lives for forty years after his first nirvana, but this is not a period of supreme emptiness. Buddha finds a little difficulty, a little obstruction in living after nirvana, and it is one of being, still there in its subtlest form. So if Buddha moves from town to town, he does so out of compassion and not out of bliss. It is his compassion that takes him to people to tell them that they too can long for, strive for and attain what he himself has attained.\nBut when Krishna goes to the people he does so out of his bliss and not out of compassion. Compassion is not his forte.\nCompassion is the ruling theme in the life of Buddha. It is out of sheer compassion that he moves from place to place for forty years. But he awaits the moment when this movement will come to an end and he will be free of it all. That is why he says that there are two kinds of nirvana, one which comes with samadhi and the other with the death of the body. With nirvana the mind ceases to be, and with Mahanirvana the body too ceases to be. This he calls sovereign nirvana, that which brings supreme emptiness with it.\nIt is not so with Krishna. With him, nirvana and mahanirvana go hand in hand.\nIf we want to be fully alive, if we want to live a rich and full life, we should be ready to invite and face any number of new and living problems. And we will live a morbid and dead life if we try to be finished with all our problems for good. Problems are necessary, but they must always be new and live problems, and man should have will, confidence and courage to meet them squarely and solve them. That is what makes for real life. And there is no reason why man should not solve them.\nOur present social setup is based wholly on fear – fear of all kinds. There is fear in its very foundation; it is fear-oriented from A to Z. We are afraid of everything around us and this fear inhibits us, does not allow us to step out of our age-old limitations. And we never think of what a mess we have made of our life and living. Fear of what is going to happen prevents us from taking any new steps forward,\nand so we refuse to see the actual state of our affairs. Because if we see what really is, we will be compelled to change the old for the new; the old is so rotten. But our fear of the new fetters our feet and we go on dragging with the old.\nI have had occasion to come into contact with hundreds of thousands of people and I observed them very closely, I really peeked into their hearts and minds. And I say I did not find a single person, man or woman, who is satisfied with his or her marriage and who is not steeped in misery on account of it. But if you point out their reality to them, they will immediately enumerate the various problems that will arise if they try to do something about it. The irony is that they are already ridden with problems, but they are not aware of them because they have become so used to them.\nIt is as if we ask a bird in a cage to fly into the open sky and it says that it is so secure in its cage, whereas the freedom of the sky will create so many problems for it. If you make a change, problems are bound to arise. And so far as the caged bird is concerned, its difficulties will be enormous, because it has no experience of flying in the vast sky. Yet a choice has to be made.\nGranted that there is security in the cage, but what worth is this security in comparison with the freedom and ecstasy of flying in the open sky? If you think only of security then the grave is the most secure place on the earth.\nQuestion 4\nQUESTIONER. SWAMI SAHAJANAND ACCUSES KRISHNA OF CORRUPTING PEOPLE RATHER THAN LIBERATING THEM THROUGH HIS PATH OF SENSUOUS ENJOYMENT. AND HE OFFERS TWO REASONS IN SUPPORT OF HIS ACCUSATION. FIRSTLY, IF ONE WORSHIPS KRISHNA AS A GOPI-LIKE DEVOTEE THIS WORSHIP IS LIKELY TO DEGENERATE INTO SOMETHING LIKE THE MAHARAJ LIBEL CASE OF GUJARAT. AND SECONDLY, IF ONE TURNS LIFE INTO A CELEBRATION IN KRISHNA’S WAY IT WILL GIVE IMPETUS TO MAN’S DESIRE FOR INDULGENCE.\nThere is yet another question arising from the same source. Question 5\nIS NOT THE WAY OF RAMA’S DEVOTEE SUPERIOR TO THAT OF KRISHNA’S? VIRTUES LIKE CELIBACY, DETACHMENT, DYNAMISM AND WISDOM ASSOCIATED WITH HANUMANA – A CHIEF DEVOTEE OF RAMA – ARE LACKING IN THE DEVOTEES OF KRISHNA LIKE MEERA, NARSI AND SURDAS, WHO ARE ALL INTROVERTS DISINTERESTED IN THE SERVICE OF SOCIETY.\nAND LASTLY I WANT TO KNOW WHY PAINTERS OF THEIR TIMES DID NOT SHOW RAMA, KRISHNA, MAHAVIRA AND BUDDHA WITH BEARDS AS THEY DID IN THE CASE OF JESUS CHRIST.\nFirstly, let us find out whether life is a schedule of duties and works to be performed, or it is a celebration. If life is work, a duty, then it is bound to turn into a burden, a drag, and we will have to go through it, as we do, with a heavy heart. Krishna does not take life as work, as duty; he takes it\nas a celebration, a festivity. Life is really a great feast, a blissful festivity. It is not homework, not a task that has to be performed willy nilly.\nIt is not that someone will cease to work if he takes life as a celebration. He will certainly work, but his work will be a part of the festivity, it will have the flavor of celebration. Then work will happen in the company of singing and dancing. It is true there will not be too much work, it will be less in quantity, but in quality it will be superb. Quantitatively the work will be less, but qualitatively it is going to be immeasurable.\nYou must have noticed how people who are addicted to work, who turn everything into work, have filled life with tension and only tension. All anxieties of life are the handiwork of the workoholics; they have turned life into a workshop. Their slogan is, do or die. They say, “Do something as long as you are alive, or die if you cannot do anything.” They have no other vision of life except work. And they don’t have even a right perspective of work. Work for what? Why does man work?\nMan works so he can live. And what does living mean? To live means to celebrate life. We work so that we can have a moment of dance in our lives. Really, work is just a means to celebrate life.\nBut the irony is that the way we live there is no leisure left to sing and dance and celebrate life. We turn means into an end; we make work the be-all and end-all of life. And then life is confined between two places, our home and the office. Home to office and back home is all we know of life. In fact, home ceases to be a home, we bring our office home with us after we leave it in the evening. Then psychologically we are in a mess; we live an entangled life, a confused and listless life. Then we keep running for the rest of our lives in the hope that someday we will have time to relax, rest and enjoy life. But that day really never comes; it will never come. Really, workoholics will never know that there is rest and joy and bliss in life.\nKrishna takes life as festivity, as a play, fun. It is how flowers, birds and stars take life. Except man, the whole world takes life as play, fun. Ask a flower why it blooms. For what? It blooms without a purpose. A star moves across the sky without a purpose. And purposelessly the wind blows, and keeps blowing. Except man, everything under the sun is a play, a carnival. Only man works and toils and sheds copious tears. Except man, the whole cosmos is celebrating. Every moment of it is celebration.\nKrishna brings this celebration into the life of man. He says, let man be one with this cosmic celebration.\nIt does not mean that there will be no work if we turn life into a celebration. It is not that the wind does not work; it is always moving, blowing. It is not that the stars are idle; they are constantly moving. It is not that flowers don’t do anything when they bloom; really, they do a lot. But for them, doing it is not that important; what is important is being. Being is primary and doing is secondary for them. Celebration comes first and work takes a back seat in their lives. Work is preparatory to celebration.\nIf you go and watch the way the primitive tribes live, you will know what work is in relation to celebration. They work the whole day so they can sing and dance with abandon at night. But the civilized man works not only in the day, but also at night. He takes pride in working day and\nnight. And if you ask him why he works, he will say that he works today so he can relax tomorrow. He postpones relaxation and continues to work in the hope that he will relax some day. But that day never comes for him.\nI am in complete agreement with Krishna’s vision of life, which is one of celebration. I am a celebrationist. May I ask what man has achieved by working day in and day out? It is different if he works for the love of work, but I would like to know what he has achieved so far by working meaninglessly?\nThere is the story of Sisyphus in Greek mythology. He was a king who was condemned by the gods to push a heavy stone uphill and, when it rolled down the hill, to begin again. Time and again Sisyphus had to carry the stone from the base of the hill to its top; this is what “an uphill task” means. A workoholic is a Sisyphus endlessly pushing a stone uphill and beginning again when it rolls down. He is now engaged in pushing the stone uphill and then chasing it when it rolls down and then beginning to push it up again. And he never comes to know a moment of leisure and joy in all his life.\nThese workoholics have turned the whole world into a madhouse. Everyone is mad with running and reaching somewhere. And no man knows where this “somewhere” is. I have heard that a man got into a taxi and asked the driver to drive fast. And the taxi sped. After a little while the driver inquired where he had to go, and the man said, “That is not the question, I have to go fast.”\nEveryone in the world is running like him, everyone is hurrying through life. “Hurry up,” has become our watchword. But no one asks, “Where are we going?” We work hard, but we don’t know why we work so hard. One does not even have time to think why he is toiling day in and day out. He is running just because his neighbor is running, his friends are running, the whole world is running. Everyone is running for fear of being left behind the other runners.\nHis son said, “It is true, as I learned from your life, that wealth is not happiness, but I also learned from your life that if one has wealth, one can have the suffering of his choice, one can choose between one suffering and another. And this freedom of choice is beautiful. I know that you were never happy, but you always chose your own kind of suffering. A poor man does not have this freedom, this choice; his suffering is determined by circumstances. Except this, there is no difference between a rich man and a poor man in the matter of suffering. A poor man has to suffer with a woman who comes his way as his wife, but the rich man can afford women with whom he wants to suffer. And this choice is not an insignificant happiness.”\nIf you examine it deeply, you will find that happiness and suffering are two aspects of the same thing, two sides of the same coin, or, perhaps, they are different densities of the same phenomenon.\nThe workoholics have done immense harm to the world. And the greatest harm they have done is that they have deprived life of its moments of celebration and festivity. It is because of them that there is so little festivity in the world, and every day it is becoming more and more dull and dreary and miserable.\nIn fact, entertainment has taken the place of celebration in the present world. But entertainment is quite different from celebration; entertainment and celebration are never the same. In celebration\nyou are a participant; in entertainment you are only a spectator. In entertainment you watch others playing for you. So while celebration is active, entertainment is passive. In celebration you dance, while in entertainment you watch someone dancing, for which you pay him. But there is a world of difference between dancing and watching a dance performed by a group of professionals who are paid for it. You work hard during the day, and when you are tired in the evening you go to a concert to watch others dancing. It is all you can do, but it is not even an apology for celebration.\nAlbert Camus has said that the time is very near when we will have servants to make love on our behalf, because we don’t have time for love. We are so busy we don’t have time for love; we will employ others to do this job for us. Love is a celebration, but for workoholics it has become a superfluous thing. It does not yield any profits; it does not add to their bank balances. Love is an end unto itself; it cannot be turned into a business. So those who are addicted to work think it a waste of time to indulge in love. A kind of secretary can be asked to deal with it and dispose of it.\nObsession with work has taken away the moments of celebration from our life, and we have been deprived of the excitement and thrill that comes with celebration. That is why nobody is happy, nobody is cheerful, nobody is blossoming. That is why suffering has become the badge of mankind.\nWe had to find a substitute for celebration, and entertainment is that substitute, because we do need a few moments of relaxation, a brief spell of diversion. But entertainment is a very poor substitute, because others do it and we are only spectators. It is like the vicarious pleasure we derive from watching someone in love. This is precisely what you do when you watch a movie. You watch a man and woman loving each other and you enjoy it vicariously. It is a false substitute; it is utterly useless. It is not going to give you a taste of love; it is not going to satiate your thirst for love. On the other hand, your disaffection and torment will deepen and land you in still greater misery.\nFor God’s sake, know love directly, enter into it, and only then you will be satiated and happy. Real love alone can make life festive, entertainment won’t.\nKrishna is all for celebration; he takes life as a great play, a mighty drama. The work-addicts have, instead of doing any good to the world, only created confusion and complication in the life of man. They have made life so complex that living has become extremely hard and painful.\nIt is true that devotees of Rama, like Hanumana, seem to be strong, active and sincere people, the devotees of Krishna are not so. Meera goes about dancing and singing, but she does not seem to be as dynamic as Hanumana. She cannot be. The reason is that while Rama takes life seriously, believes life is all work, Krishna is non-serious and takes life as a dance, a celebration. And life as celebration is a different thing altogether. Life as work pales in insignificance before it. If you are asked to spend twenty-four hours in the company of Hanumana you will think twice. You would want to run away from him if you were made to live in the same room with him for a long while. But you can live with Meera joyfully for any length of time.\nIt is true that Krishna’s lovers gradually withdrew themselves from the world of outer activity, from the world of extroversion. They dived deep into the interiority of life and drank at the fountain of its bliss. This is as it should be, because Krishna knows how, when you lose yourself in its outer activities, you are missing life itself.\nIt will be a peaceful and happy world that will abound with Meeras. And a world full of Hanumanas will be a restless and warring world, a sorry world. If it comes into being, wrestling rings will appear all over and society will be ridden with conflict and strife. We can accommodate one or two Hanumanas; more than that would be too much. But any number of Meeras will be welcome. Meera is in contact with life at its deeper levels; Hanumana lives at the surface. Hanumana is nothing more than a faithful servant, a volunteer; he is just serving his master. He is, of course, sincere, persevering and hard-working. Meera is a class by herself; she is rare. Her bliss, her ecstasy comes from being, not from doing. For her, just being is festive and joyous. Her song, her dance, is not a piece of work for her, it is an expression of her bliss, her ecstasy. She is so blissful that she is bursting into song and dance.\nI would like this world to be more and more filled with song and dance, with music and festivity. And so far as the external world, the world of extroversion and action is concerned, we should go into it only to the extent needed for our inward journey. More than that is not necessary. We need bread, but bread is not everything. We need bread to live, but there are people who go on stockpiling bread and, in the meantime, forget all about eating and living. By the time they succeed in making a mountain of bread their appetite is gone and they don’t know what to do with the huge stock.\nWhen Alexander was leaving for India he went to see Diogenes, a great sage of the times. Diogenes asked Alexander, “Where are you going and for what?”\nAlexander said, “I am going to conquer Asia Minor first.”\nThen Diogenes queried, “And what will you do after conquering Asia Minor?” “I will then go to conquer India,” said the would-be conqueror.\n“And what then?” asked the sage.\nAnd the answer was, “I have to conquer the whole world.”\nDiogenes was Lying on the sandy bank of a river; he was completely naked and enjoying the morning sunshine. He asked again, “What will you do after you have conquered the world?”\nAlexander said, “Then I will rest and relax.”\nThis reply of Alexander’s sent Diogenes into loud laughter, and he called his companion, his dog, who was sitting some distance from him. When the dog came to him Diogenes said, addressing the dog, “Listen to what this mad king is saying. This man says that he will rest after he conquers the world. And here we are resting right now without conquering a single place.” And he said to Alexander, “If rest is your ultimate objective, why not join me and my dog right now on this beautiful river bank? There is enough space here for us all. I am already resting. Why ate you going to create so much trouble and disturbance around the world just to rest at the end of it all? You can rest right here and now.”\nAn embarrassed Alexander then said, “What you say seems to be very sensible, but I cannot rest right now. Let me first conquer the world.”\nAnd then the sage said, “There is no connection whatsoever between world conquest and rest. Here I am, resting well, without having to go in conquest of the world.”\nWhat Diogenes told Alexander at the end of their dialogue proved to be prophetic. He said, “You will in fact, turn back mid-journey. Who has ever returned after completing his journey?” On his way back from India the conqueror died; he could not reach Greece.\nAll Alexanders die, and die mid journey. They gather wealth but don’t have the time to enjoy it. They do everything to collect all the instruments of an orchestra, and when everything is ready they find to their despair that they have lost the capacity to play them. Their hands are empty and they can’t do anything but weep. Alexander died empty handed.\nNo, life is meant to be a celebration; celebration is its central note. If someone asks you, better ask this question of yourself: “Do I live to work or work to live?” Then the answer will become very clear to you, and you will move much closer to Krishna. You do everything so you live, and not so you live to work and work meaninglessly. And to live you don’t need to do much; too much doing has no meaning.\nIf this attitude that we work to live gains ground, much of our trouble and misery will disappear. Most of our troubles arise from our madness to do too much, and if this madness goes, there will be much more peace and joy and cheer in the world than we have at the moment. With the disappearance of overdoing, many things will disappear – tension and anxiety will disappear, mental diseases and madhouses will disappear. This much harm it will do, if you take it as harm. It will be a sane world indeed.\nTherefore I say that I am in complete accord with Krishna’s festive vision of life.\nYou also want to know why all the avataras and Tirthankaras of this country, like Rama, Krishna, Mahavira and Buddha, have been portrayed without beards. What may the reasons be?\nI don’t think all of them were without beards; one or two might have been exceptions to the rule. It is not factual that they did not have beards, yet it is true that not one of them has been portrayed with a beard. There must be reasons for it.\nFirstly, the time before one grows a beard is the freshest and finest time of his life. That is the peak moment of life’s freshness; after that it begins to decline. But as far as men like Krishna are concerned we saw them as the very picture of that freshness, of that infinite freshness, and saw that they retained this freshness through their whole lives. There is never a point of decline in their freshness; they are always young and new. Not that they don’t age and grow old. They all age, but as far as their consciousness is concerned it is always in the adolescent state. Their consciousness is eternally young, eternally new, eternally fresh.\nThese paintings and portraits of Rama, Krishna, Mahavira and Buddha that we see without beards, do not represent their persons; they represent their spirit, their soul, their consciousness. We saw a constant freshness, youthfulness, accompanying them through their childhood, their youth and old age, and we captured that freshness in our paintings and pictures of them.\nWe can never think of Krishna as an old man leaning on a cane. He must have grown to old age, for he lived long, but we fail to imagine how he looked as an old man. There is something in him which is eternally young and alive.\nOn the other hand there are children who seem to be born old. Recently I visited a town where a young girl met me – she was hardly thirteen or fourteen years old – and she said that she wanted moksha, liberation. Now this girl is already an old woman, and I told her so. She has yet to live life and she talks of liberation. She has yet to be in bondage and she wants to be free of it. She told me that she belongs to a family where everyone is religious. I even visited her family, which was really a religious family – sad, somber and dead. Everyone in that family was waiting for moksha; no one had time to live. Her father looked dead, her mother looked dead; even the youngsters of the family looked anemic and ill. It seemed to me they were living in the shadow of fasting and starvation; they were dissipated and dead.\nNaturally this girl has grown old, and if an artist paints a picture of her he would not want to show her as a young woman. That would be an inauthentic picture. The artist will have to show her as a seventy or eighty year-old woman. That would be her correct mental age.\nBuddha, Mahavira, Krishna and Rama are ever young, really adolescent. We could have painted them as twenty-five years old as well. That is the age of youth, but then they would have to be shown with beards. But we portrayed them as teenagers without beards and mustaches. ’Why? There is a reason for this too. It was not proper to portray them as twenty five year-olds with beards and mustaches, because that would have shown they were on their way to Qld age. Once a thing begins, it necessarily has to come to an end. You cannot portray the eternally young with beard and mustache; that would defeat the very purpose. So adolescence is the right age in which to show them, because it is the prime time of newness.\nThere is yet another reason why men like Krishna are shown without beards. Man’s concept of beauty is feminine; it is derived from the beauty of women. For him, woman, and not man, is the image of beauty. And most of our painters and sculptors, our poets and our writers of scriptures have been men. Naturally if they have to depict someone as handsome, beautiful, they will do so in terms of feminine beauty. So if Krishna has to be portrayed as a beautiful person – and he is superb; who can be more beautiful than him? – he will certainly be shown in exquisite feminine beauty. That is why statues and portraits of Buddha, Krishna and others like him have feminine faces. Their images are distinctly feminine; they are fat from masculine, because man’s understanding of beauty comes from his appreciation of woman’s beauty.\nIt is for this reason that with the growth of man’s aesthetic sense, all the world over, he began to shave his beard and mustache. First, he removed them from the faces of Krishna and Buddha, and then from his own. Because he believes that woman’s face is much more beautiful than his own, he has been trying to imitate her in various ways.\nBut woman’s concept of beauty is quite different; her concept of beauty is masculine, is based on her appreciation of man’s beauty. A woman is not attracted by another woman’s beauty, she is always attracted by the beauty of man. Her image of beauty comes from the man’s face. So I think if women had painted pictures of Krishna and Buddha they would definitely have shown them with beards and mustaches.\nI don’t think that even today women like men with shaved faces; they look feminine to them. The beard and mustache are symbols of masculinity for women. Just think how you would react to a woman who appears before you with a beard and mustache on her face; she will be repelling. In the same way a man without a beard and mustache should repel a woman. Whether she says so or not is another thing, because women don’t have even this much freedom. that they can express their likes and dislikes. Even their ways of thinking are determined by men; they cannot assert their own preferences.\nRemember, whenever and wherever masculine beauty manifests itself in its full grandeur, beards and mustaches return to men’s faces. It has always been that masculine beauty gains its peak with the return of the beard and mustache. But when man begins to imitate women, he shaves his beard and thus loses a part of his masculinity.\nIt is ironic that women are out to imitate men on a very large scale. This craze has become almost worldwide. Women now want to dress in jeans like men, because their concept of beauty is based on their appreciation of the male look. They like to wear watches on their wrists exactly as men do. They are taking to men’s professions for the same reason. They think that man is the picture of beauty and strength. Their whole lib movement is moving in the direction of imitating man. And if someday they win – there is every likelihood that they will win, because men have dominated long, and they must now quit so that women take center stage – it will not be surprising to see women wearing beards and mustaches. Today we cannot even think of it; it seems quite unthinkable. But they have already started wearing beards and mus taches in subtler ways; they are doing their very best to imitate men in every way. They want to look like men; they are out to become carbon copies.\nBut whether men imitate women or women imitate men, it is ugly and absurd. It is utterly stupid. Imitation itself is stupid.\nPainters and sculptors who portrayed Krishna, Rama and Buddha, were men, admirers of feminine beauty, and for this very reason none of these portraits can be said to be authentic. If you see the statues of the twenty four Jaina tirthankaras you will be surprised to find that they are all alike, that there is not the least difference between one and another. If you remove the different signs engraved at the bottom of their statues, you cannot tell one from the other; they are exactly the same. Similarly, there is no difference between the statues of Mahavira and Buddha other than of clothes. While Mahavira is naked, Buddha is in clothes. Do you think all of them really looked alike?\nNo, it is impossible they all looked alike. It rarely happens that two persons have exactly the same face, not even twins. But the painters and sculptors have achieved the miracle. How? The painter engaged in portraying Buddha is doing his best to make his portrait the most beautiful even. The sculptor of Mahavira’s statue works with the same objective in mind. And the net result of this effort of theirs to achieve perfection in beauty is that their images turn out alike.\nQuestion 6\nQUESTIONER: YOU SAY THAT ONE SHOULD WORK ONLY ENOUGH TO LIVE, NOT MORE THAN THAT. IF THIS ATTITUDE TOWARDS WORK BECOMES PREVALENT, MEERA WILL CEASE TO HAVE A TANPOORA, AN INSTRUMENT IN HER HANDS AND WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO RECORD YOUR DISCOURSES. THE TANPOORA AND THE TAPE RECORDER ARE\nTHE FRUITS OF HUMAN LABOR. SO WE QUESTION AS: HOW WILL POVERTY GO IF MAN ACCEPTS CELEBRATION AS THE WAY OF LIFE?\nIt is worth considering whether Meera’s tanpoora is the handiwork of work addicts or of those who take celebration as a way of life. Work-addicts don’t produce a tanpoora, they produce a spade. The tanpoora has no connection with work; the exponents of work produce a hammer, a hatchet and a sword. The tanpoora is the creation of those who take life as play, fun. Whatever is superb in human creation, be it a tanpoora of a Taj Mahal, is the gift of those whose way of life is celebration. These things of beauty arise from their dreams and fantasies.\nIt is natural that men and women who take life as celebration should accept the help of those who take life as work and toil. But the work-addicts can also take their work as a play, and then the quality of their work will be very different, and so will be the quality of their lives and ways of living. I think the laborers who put the marble of the Taj Mahal together never knew the joy that a mere look at this marvelous piece of architecture brings to you. For the laborers who built the Taj it was merely work, a means of livelihood. But was it not possible that the same marble could have been put together in a celebrative way?\nI love to tell this story again and again. A temple is under construction on the outskirts of a town and a few laborers are busy cutting stones for it. A passerby stops to see what is being built. He goes to one of the laborers and asks, “What are you doing?”\nThe man was sad and serious, even looked angry with himself. Without raising his gaze to the visitor the laborer said, “Don’t you see I am cutting stones?”\nThe visitor moved to another laborer, and put the same question to him, “What are you doing?”\nThis man looked sad too, but was not angry. He put down his hammer and chisel, raised his eyes to the visitor, said glumly, “I am earning my bread,” and resumed his work.\nThe visitor moved to a third workman who was engaged in the same kind of work near the main gate of the temple. He was in a happy mood, singing. “What are you doing, my friend?” the passerby asked of him too.\nAnd the man said in a very pleasant voice, “I am constructing a temple.” And then he resumed his stone cutting and his singing.\nAll three workmen are engaged in the same job, stone-cutting, but their attitude to work is quite different from one another. As far as the third workman is concerned he has turned work into a celebration; he can work and sing together.\nI don’t say don’t abolish poverty, don’t have technology and affluence. All I say is that you can create technology and wealth by way of celebration; It is not necessary to treat them as duty and work. The affluence that comes with celebration has a beauty of its own You can abolish poverty through hard and painful work, but you will remain poor in spite of your wealth. Poverty of the spirit cannot go until you turn work into a celebration. Maybe the way of celebration will take more time, but it will abolish both kinds of poverty – material and spiritual.\nIt is really a question of our attitude towards what we do. And with the change of attitude, with work turning into a celebration, the whole milieu of life changes.\nA gardener works in your garden; it is his livelihood. He does not take his work as celebration. But he can no one can prevent him if he chooses to change his attitude. Granted that he has to earn his bread, that he must earn his bread, but at the same time he can enjoy his work, he can celebrate with the blossoming flowers, he can sway and sing with them. Who comes in his way except himself, except his attitude towards work? And curiously, he does not earn a lot by taking his work as a means to an end. But if he takes his work joyfully, if he rejoices with the blooming flowers, if celebration becomes primary and work secondary, he will attain to a richness of life he has never known. Then the same gardening will bring him a blissfulness he will never know otherwise.\nPoverty should go, suffering should go, but they should go to enable man to take part in the celebration of life As long as a man remains poor, it is hard for him to celebrate life, to participate in its festival. That is why I stand for the abolition of poverty. To me, elimination of poverty does not mean merely providing the poor with food, clothes and shelter. It is necessary, but it is not all. In my view, unless man’s physical needs are fulfilled, he cannot raise his sights to the higher need of life, to the fulfillment of spirit, soul, call it what you may. Bread can only fill his belly; to fulfill his spirit he badly needs the milieu of joy and festivity in his life.\nAnd if we direct our attention to the higher realms of life, to soul or spirit, then we can turn all work into celebration. Then we will plough a field and sing a song together; we will sow and dance together. Until recently, this was the way of life all over. The farmer worked on his farm and also sang a song. The worker in a modern factory has lost that magic, and consequently his work has ceased to be joyful, it is dull and listless. The factory is only a workshop; it knows nothing but seven hours of work for which the worker is paid adequately or inadequately. That is why, when a worker returns home in the evening after a day’s toil, he is dead tired, broken and unhealed.\nBut I tell you, sooner or later song is going to enter the precincts of the factory. Great studies are underway in many advanced countries and this realization is dawning on them, that work should cease to be work alone, that it has to be pleasant and joyful. The day is not far off when factories will resound with music, because without it man will be more and more empty and unhappy. And the introduction of music in factories will not only bring some joy to their work men, it will add to the quality of their work.\nA housewife cooks in her home. She can cook in the way a cook in some hotel does. But then it will be work, dull and tiring. But she can also cook as a woman cooks for her lover who is to visit her. Then cooking is a celebration which never tires you. Really, such work is highly fulfilling. But mere work is going to tire you, exhaust you, leave you utterly empty.\nIt is really a matter of our attitude towards what we do. Question 7\nQUESTIONER: YOU SAID THAT KRISHNA HAD GONE BEYOND MIND, AND YOU ALSO SAID THAT, IMPELLED BY THE NATURAL INSTINCTS OF THE MIND, HE DEPRIVED THE GOPIS OF THEIR CLOTHES. HOW IS IT THAT A PERSON WHO HAS TRANSCENDED THE MIND ACTS\nTHROUGH IT? AND IF IT IS SO, IS IT ANY DIFFERENT FROM THE INSTINCTUAL BEHAVIOR OF ANIMALS?\nWhen I say Krishna has gone beyond mind it does not mean that he is not left with a mind. To go beyond the mind means that one has known that which is beyond mind. Mind remains even after you have transcended it, but it is a different mind altogether, it is a mind cleansed and stilled and saturated with the beyond. Krishna is larger than his mind, but the mind has a place in him.\nTranscendence of mind can be attempted in two ways. If you try to transcend it through suppression, through fight, the mind will be divided and torn, it will degenerate into a schizophrenic mind. But if you transcend it in a friendly way, through love and understanding, the mind will be integrated and settled in wisdom.\nWhen I say that I have transcended my body it does not mean that I am not my body, or that my body has ceased to be, it only means that I am now not only my body, but much more than it. I am body plus something, something has been added to it. Until yesterday I thought I was only the body, but now I know that I am something more than the body. I remain the body; that “something plus” has not eliminated it, rather it has highly enhanced and enriched it. Now I have also a soul; I am both body and soul.\nIn the same way, when I come to know God it does not mean that my soul or spirit has ceased to be, it only means that I am now body, spirit and God all together. Then mind and soul are absorbed in that which is immense, which is infinite. It is not a matter of losing something, it is gaining more and more all the way up.\nSo when I say that Krishna has gone beyond mind I mean to say that he has known that which is beyond the mind, he has known the immense, the eternal. But he continues to have a mind, a mind with heightened sensitivity and awareness. Krishna is not inimical to mind; he has not transcended it by way of fight and suppression, he has gone beyond it by living with it in a very friendly way. Therefore I say that whatever happens between him and his girlfriends is the spontaneous outpouring of his exceedingly innocent mind; he cannot but act naturally, innocently and spontaneously.\nMind is unnatural when it is in conflict, when it is fighting with itself. Mind is unnatural when one of its fragments says do this and another says don’t do this. And when the whole mind is together, integrated and one, then everything it does becomes natural, then whatever happens or does not happen is natural and spontaneous. Then there is nothing unnatural about it. And what is natural is right. But you have rightly asked: If it is so what is the difference between man and animal?\nIn one respect there is no difference whatsoever between man and animal, and in another respect the difference is great. The animal is natural and innocent, but it is not aware of it. Krishna is natural and innocent, but he is also aware of it. In respect to their naturalness and innocence Krishna and the animal are very similar, but with regard to their consciousness there is a tremendous difference.\nAn animal moves and acts instinctively, spontaneously and naturally, lives in a state of let-go, but has no awareness of it, all its acts are mechanical. Krishna also lives in a state of let-go, allows his nature free and full play, but he is fully aware of it. His witnessing center is always alert and aware of everything that happens in and around him. The animal has no witnessing center.\nWhile Krishna has gone beyond mind, the animal is below the level of mind. The animal does not have a mind, it has only a body and instincts and it functions mechanically. So there is a kind of similarity between one who is above mind and one who is below it.\nThere is an old saying prevalent among sages that when one attains to the highest wisdom he becomes like the most ignorant person on the earth. There is some truth in this saying.\nOne of the sages of ancient India is known as Jarbharat, which literally means Bharat the Ignorant. Really, he was one of the wisest sages of this country, but he was named Jarbharat, Bharat the Ignorant, because he looked like an extremely ignorant person. In a way perfect wisdom looks like perfect ignorance; at least in perfection they are similar. A man of wisdom is at rest, because he has known everything, nothing remains to be known. An ignorant person is also at rest, because he does not know a thing. To be restless it is necessary to know a little. An animal functions very unconsciously; Krishna functions with full awareness. Nothing happens to him in unawareness.\nThat is why we say when someone attains to the highest wisdom he becomes like a child. Somebody asks Jesus, “How is your kingdom of God? How is one who attains to God?”\nJesus says, “One who attains to God becomes like a child.” But Jesus does not say that a child attains to God. If it were so all children would attain to God. He does not say that one who attains to God becomes a child, he says he becomes like a child. If he says that a sage becomes a child, it would mean that a child has perfect wisdom, which is not the case. If children were perfect we need not do anything with them. No, the child is below the level of the developed mind, while the sage has gone beyond. The child will have to pass through a phase of conflict, tension and struggle; the sage has outlived all conflicts and tensions. The child potentially carries with him all the sicknesses man is heir to; the wise man has outlived such sicknesses. In the course of evolution even the animal will have to pass through all the sicknesses of man. But here is Krishna who has outlived them, transcended them, gone beyond them.\nThe similarity and difference between man and animal are well-defined. Question 8\nQUESTIONER: YOU TALKED ABOUT SWADHARMA, SELF-NATURE, THE INNATE INDIVIDUALITY OF MAN. THE GEETA SAYS THAT ONE’S OWN NATURE, EVEN IF IT BE INFERIOR IN QUALITY, IS PREFERABLE TO AN ALIEN NATURE OF SUPERIOR QUALITY. THEN THE QUESTION IS: HOW CAN SELF-NATURE, WHICH IS ONE’S INNATE INDIVIDUALITY, BE INFERIOR IN QUALITY?\nLet it be the last question for this discourse, and then we will sit for meditation.\nYou ask how one’s self-nature or the innate individuality can be inferior in quality. In this connection two things have to be considered.\nThe first. Everything in its origin is without any attribute, quality; it gathers attributes only after it takes a form and grows. There is a seed; it has no attributes whatsoever. The seed has just potentiality; it has no quality other than this. It can give birth to a flower which is not yet there. Tomorrow it will turn\ninto a flower, and then this flower will have certain attributes, qualities. It will be red in color, it will be fragrant; then it will have an individuality of its own. But right now, as a seed, there is nothing in it. It will take on attributes only after it comes to express itself, after it sprouts, grows and blossoms into a flower.\nThe world has many attributes; God has none. God is seed-like; he is unmanifest. When God manifests himself in the form of the world he acquires attributes, and these attributes disappear when he again becomes unmanifest. Someone is a saint and another person is a thief. As saint and thief they have certain attributes, but when they, the saint and the thief, go to sleep, they are without any attributes. Neither does the saint remain a saint nor the thief remain a thief. In sleep all attributes disappear; sleep is a state without attributes. Attributes appear with the waking state; with sleep they go to sleep too. When they wake up the saint will become a saint and the thief will become a thief again. In sleep we are very close to our individuality, our innate nature; rather, we are closest to it. And in samadhi, in ecstasy, we actually attain to our supreme nature, which is of the highest.\nSo the experiencing of the pristine nature has no attributes, no traits whatsoever. But when self- nature manifests itself it acquires attributes. Attribute and non-attribute are not two things; they are not contradictory. They are just the ways of the manifest and the unmanifest.\nSelf-nature, supreme nature, has two states. One is the unmanifest state when it is in seed form, asleep, absorbed in itself. And the other is the manifest state when it takes form and attributes. Really, no manifestation can be without form and attributes; it has to have a form, a shape, a color and a speciality.\nA small story comes to mind, a Zen story. A Zen Master teaches his disciples how to paint. Painting is the medium through which he really leads his disciples into meditation. One can travel to meditation from anywhere and everywhere. There is no point in the world from where you cannot make a start for meditation. This Master has ten disciples who are gathered round him one morning. He tells them, “Go and make a picture whose broad outlines should be like this. There is a cow in a grassy land, and the cow is grazing. You have to paint it, but remember, the painting has to have no form, no attributes.”\nThe disciples find themselves in great difficulty. It is the job of a Master to put his disciples in difficulty, in crisis, because only in crisis can they become aware of themselves. The disciples find it extremely hard to paint a picture without form and attributes; it seems an impossible task. They have to use lines and colors. They have to give the cow some form; they have to show the grass all over the field.\nNine of the ten disciples attempt to paint and the next day return with some sort of paintings which don’t have any clearcut outlines, everything is hazy and unclear. But a sort of cow is there in each painting. In drawing the grass they certainly made use of abstract art so it is formless as much as possible. Nevertheless, they have to use colors of some sort.\nInspecting each other’s paintings, a disciple asks one of his friends, “Where is the cow?”\nThe other says, “I had some idea of a cow when I was in the process of painting, but now I cannot say where the cow is.”\nAnd the Master rejects all nine pictures saying, “How can you have color and a cow in a painting that has to be without form and attributes?”\nThe tenth disciple has just a blank sheet of paper in his hand, and the Master says, “Yes, this is it.”\nThe nine disciples who have attempted to paint feel disappointed and they protest, “Where is the cow?”\nThe Master says, “The cow went home after grazing.” “And where is the grass?” they protest further.\nThe Master says, “The cow ate it up. So things have gone back to their original places. Things have returned to their unmanifest state. This is really painting without form and attributes. It shows a cow who is finished grazing and a plot of grass the cow has eaten up. Empty space, just space is there.”\nAt its deepest level self nature is without any form, without any attributes; it is utter emptiness. It becomes manifest with the grass appearing and the cow coming to graze on it. Then the play of attributes happens. And it all becomes unmanifest once again after the cow has eaten up the grass.\nThis vast expanse of our world was born out of emptiness, which is without form, and it will return to the same emptiness. Everything appears and disappears, but the source is the same emptiness, the immense void. And the whole is hidden in that emptiness which by its nature cannot have a name, a shape and an adjective.\nIn this sense, self-nature, like everything else, has two states: the manifest and the unmanifest. While the manifest has a name and form, attributes, the unmanifest has none whatsoever.\nIn the same way we have to see Krishna from two sides, because he has two sides. His one side is visible and his other side is invisible. The skeptic will see only the visible, the manifest form of Krishna, but one who has faith, who is trusting will see the other side too, the invisible, the unmanifest. Thought, contemplation and logic cannot go beyond the form, the manifest; but trust, prayer and meditation can enter the reality, the unseen, the unmanifest. But one who fails to grasp even the form, the manifest, the gross, can hardly be expected to reach the formless, the unmanifest, the subtle.\nBut thought and logic, rightly used, can take you to the point where the seen, the manifest ends and the unseen, the unmanifest begins. Beyond it thought is absolutely useless; beyond it a jump, a leap is a must. Beyond it you have to get out of your intellect, your mind; you have to go beyond your own mind, beyond self. Actually you have to transcend yourself.\nBut this transcendence of the mind does not mean that one will cease to know everything that he has known before. Now all that he has known before will be absorbed and assimilated in the newly acquired knowledge of the beyond. The day the manifest and the unmanifest meet and merge into each other, the ultimate truth comes into being.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"11429","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/krishna__the_man_and_his_philosophy/part7/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/krishna__the_man_and_his_philosophy/>Krishna - The Man and His Philosophy</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">7 Make Work a Celebration</h1><div class=post-meta>54 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;11429 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Krishna__The_Man_and_His_Philosophy/part7.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part6>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

PERHAPS GOES FOR THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF MARRIAGES IN HISTORY. IS HE
GUILTY OF ENCOURAGING THE IMMORALITY WHICH MARRIAGE IS?</p><p><br></p><p>I say marriage is immoral, but I don’t say marrying is immoral. A man
and a woman in love with each other would like to live together, so a
marriage stemming from love will not be immoral. But we are doing just
the contrary; we are trying to squeeze love from marriage, which is not
possible. Marriage is a bondage, and love is freedom. But a couple in
love would like to live together, which is natural. This togetherness
will flow from love. Marriage should be the shadow of love and not
otherwise.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t say that after the abolition of marriage a man and a woman
will not live together. The truth is, only then will they really live
together. At the moment they only seem to be living together, they
really don’t live together. Mere physical togetherness is not
togetherness. Living in close proximity in space is not living together.
And just to be coupled in marriage is not really coupling, not true
union.</p><p><br></p><p>It is the institution of marriage which I call immoral. The
institution of marriage would like love to be banished from the world.
As such, every institution is unnatural: it is against man’s natural
feelings and emotions; it cannot exist without suppressing them. When
any two people fall in love with each other, their love is unique and
incomparable; no other two people have ever loved each other the same
way. But when two persons get married, that marriage is very ordinary,
commonplace, millions</p><p>of people have known marriage the same way. Love is an original and
unique phenomenon, while marriage is just a tradition, a repetition. A
marriage strangles and kills love. As the institution of marriage
becomes dominant and powerful, it thwarts and throttles love to the same
degree.</p><p><br></p><p>The day we accord love its priority in our lives; the day a man and a
woman live together not by way of a contract and compromise but out of
love and love alone, marriage as we know it will cease to exist. And
with marriage will go today’s system of divorce. Then a couple will live
together for the sake of their love and happiness. and for no other
consideration, and they will part company and separate when the love
between them dries up and disappears. Society will not come in their way
in any manner.</p><p><br></p><p>I repeat: marriage as an institution is immoral, and marriage that
comes in the wake of love is quite natural. There is nothing immoral
about it.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2</p><p><br></p><p>QUESTIONER: WHAT WILL BE THE POSITION OF CHILDREN IN A MARRIAGE WHICH
HIS LOVE AS ITS BASIS? WHERE WILL THEY BELONG? AND WILL THEY NOT BECOME
A SOCIAL PROBLEM? PLEASE EXPLAIN.</p><p><br></p><p>So many problems seem to loom up if love becomes the basis of
marriage. But they loom up only because we see things through the screen
of our old concepts and beliefs. The day we accord love its highest
value, the idea that children belong to individuals, to parents, will
become meaningless. Really, children don’t belong to individuals; they
really never belong to them. There was a time when the father was un.
known, only the mother was known. That was the age of matriarchy, when
the mother was the head of the family and descent was reckoned through
the female line.</p><p><br></p><p>You will be surprised to know the word “father” is not that old; the
word “uncle” is much older. “Mother” is an ancient word, while “father”
is very new. The father really appeared on the scene when we
institutionalized marriage; he was not known before. The whole male
population of a tribe was father-like; only the mother of a child was
known. The whole tribe was loving to its children, and since they
belonged to none they belonged to all.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not right to say that ownership of children by individuals, by
parents, has been good for children. True good will happen when children
belong to a whole commune or society.</p><p><br></p><p>You ask what the position of children will be when we will make love
the basis of marriage. Will not they become a social problem? No, they
will not be a social problem then. They are a social problem tight now,
when we have left them at the mercy of a few individuals, be they
parents or relations. And in view of the new vista of future
possibilities opening up before us, it is certain that the old
foundations of our society are not going to last any longer.</p><p><br></p><p>For instance, in the old world a father was a must for a child to be
born, it will not be so in the future. In fact, he has already become
redundant. Now my sperm can be preserved for thousands of years after my
death. and it can give birth to a chill even ten thousand years after
me.</p><p><br></p><p>Then in the future, even the mother, who has so far been so
indispensable, will not be needed for the birth of a child. Soon science
is going to find ways and means – we are at the doorstep of its</p><p>consummation – when a mother will not need to carry the burden of a
baby in her womb for nine months. A machine, an instrument like the test
tube will do the job better. All the facilities that are available to a
baby in the mother’s womb will be provided to him, and he will be better
provided for in a test tube or whatever we will call it. And then it
will be difficult to know the parentage of a child. Then the whole
social structure will have to be changed. Then all women will play
mothers and all men will play fathers to children who will grow up under
the collective care of the community. For sure, everything is going to
change.</p><p><br></p><p>What I am saying has become necessary because of the way science is
currently developing throughout the world. But we don’t understand it
because we continue to think in out old ways, which are out of date. Now
when a child is born to you, you consult the best possible physician
about his health and upkeep; you don’t think that, being his father or
mother, you can treat your child medically too. In the same way you go
to a good tailor to have clothes made for him; you don’t sew them
yourself because you happen to be his parent. Likewise, with the
deepening of your understanding you will want your child to be born with
the help of much healthier sperm than your own, so that he is not
retarded physically or mentally, so that he is endowed with a healthy
body and an intelligent mind. So you would want to secure the best sperm
available for the birth of your child.</p><p>On her part, a would-be mother would not like to drag on for nine
months with a baby in her womb when facilities will be made available to
grow a child externally in a better and healthier manner. The function
of parents, as it is today, will then cease to be necessary. And with
the cessation of the function of parents, how will marriage itself
exist? Then the very basis of marriage will disappear. Technology on one
hand and the science of man’s mind on the other, are heading towards a
point when individual claim on children will come to an end.</p><p><br></p><p>This does not mean that all man’s problems will end with this radical
change in the social structure. Every new experiment, every change we
make brings its own problems with it. It is not a great question that
problems as such should cease to be – man will always have problems –
the great question is that we should have newer and greater problems to
deal with than what we now have. The real question is that our problems
of today should be better than those we had yesterday.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not that with the abolition of marriage every conflict between
man and man, between man and woman will disappear for good. But, for
sure, the conflicts that arise from marriage – and they are more than
enough – will go. However, newer conflicts and newer problems will arise
and it will be a joy to deal with them. To live on this planet problems
will always be needed, because it is through our struggle with problems
that we grow and mature.</p><p><br></p><p>In this connection it is necessary to take notice of a particular
problem which comes our way again and again. The problem is that we get
used to putting up with the problems of the social system we are given
to live in. And so we are afraid of facing those new and unfamiliar
problems that are likely to come with a better and higher social system
– even if such a system becomes necessary and feasible. And thus we get
stuck with a decadent and dying system, and that is what makes for our
real difficulty, our real problem. But it is the task of intelligence to
understand that if newer and better problems are available, in the wake
of change, it is right to go for the change and to grapple with those
problems and solve them.</p><p>I hold that so long as love does not bloom fully in a man’s life he
will not attain to the glory and grandeur of life, he will remain
lackluster. A life devoid of love is dull and dreary; it is a
veritable</p><p>desert. And I think that a life full of problems, full of energy and
glow, is far more preferable to a life that is dull, dreary and dead. I
would like to conclude this discussion with a small anecdote.</p><p><br></p><p>A little bunch of wildflowers lived sheltered in the crevices of an
old city wall. Winds and storms failed to disturb them since they were
well protected by the high wall and its crevices. For the same reason,
the sun’s rays could not burn them nor could the rains ruin them.</p><p><br></p><p>There was a rosebush in the neighborhood of this little bunch of
wildflowers. The presence of gorgeous roses made the wildflowers feel
inferior and ashamed of their own existence. So one fine morning the
wildflowers prayed to God, “So long we have lived as faceless flowers;
now please turn us into roses.”</p><p><br></p><p>God said in answer, “Why get into unnecessary troubles? The life of a
rose is very hard. When there is a storm, it shakes it to its roots. And
when it blooms, there is already someone around to pluck it. You live a
well-protected life, don’t forsake it.”</p><p><br></p><p>But the wildflowers insisted, “We have long lived a sheltered life;
we now want to live dangerously. Please make us roses for twenty-four
hours.”</p><p><br></p><p>Other wildflowers pleaded, “Don’t be crazy. We have heard that a few
of our ancestors had to suffer terribly because of this very craze to
become a rose. Our racial experience says we are okay as we are, we
should not try to be roses.’l</p><p><br></p><p>But the little plant again said, “I want to gossip with the stars; I
want to fight with the storms; I W Int to bathe in the rains. I am
determined to become a rose.”</p><p><br></p><p>At long last God yielded and one fine morning the little bunch of
wildflowers became a rose. And immediately its saga of trials and
tribulations began. Storms came and shook its roots. Rains came and it
was drowned in water. The midday sun burned its petals and made it
suffer immeasurably. At all times it was exposed to dangers from all
sides. Once again other elderly wildflowers gathered round the newborn
rose and said, “We had told you so; you did not listen. Don’t you see
how secure you were in your old life? Granted it had its problems, but
they were old and familiar problems, and we were used to them. It was
okay. Do you see what a mess you have made of your life?”</p><p><br></p><p>To this the new rose said, “You are fools. I say that it is far
better to be a rose just for twenty-four hours and live dangerously than
to live in lifelong security as little wildflowers protected by a high
wall. It was great to breathe with the storms and fight with the winds.
I was in contact with the sun and I had a dialogue with the stars. I
have achieved my soul and I am so fulfilled. I lived fully and I am
going to die fully. As far as you are concerned you live a life of
living death.”</p><p><br></p><p>But going back to the world does not make any difference to Krishna:
he can easily go back if it becomes necessary. He will remain himself in
every situation – in love and attachment, in anger and hostility.
Nothing will disturb his emptiness, his calm. He will find no difficulty
whatsoever is coming and going. His emptiness is positive and complete,
alive and dynamic.</p><p><br></p><p>But so far as experiencing it is concerned it is the same whether you
come to Buddha’s emptiness or Krishna’s. Both will take you into bliss.
But where Buddha’s emptiness will bring you relaxation</p><p>and rest, maybe Krishna’s emptiness will lead you to immense action.
If we can coin a phrase like “active void”, it will appropriately
describe Krishna’s emptiness. And the emptiness of Buddha and Mahavira
should be called “passive void”. Bliss is common to both but with one
difference: the bliss of the active void will be creative and the other
kind of bliss will dissolve itself in the great void.</p><p><br></p><p>You can ask one more question, after which we will sit for
meditation. Question 3</p><p>QUESTIONER: HOW IS IT THAT BUDDHA LIVES FOR FORTY YEARS AFTER
ATTAINING NIRVANA OR THE GREAT EMPTINESS?</p><p><br></p><p>It is true Buddha lives for forty to forty-two years after he becomes
Buddha. Mahavira also lives about the same period of time. But Buddha
makes a difference between nirvana and nirvana. Just before leaving his
body he says that what he had attained under the bodhi tree was just
nirvana, emptiness, and what he is now going to attain will be
mahanirvana or supreme emptiness. In his first nirvana Buddha achieves
the emptiness we can see, but his second emptiness, his mahanirvana, is
such that we cannot see it. Of course men like Krishna and Buddha can
see it.</p><p><br></p><p>It is true that Buddha lives for forty years after his first nirvana,
but this is not a period of supreme emptiness. Buddha finds a little
difficulty, a little obstruction in living after nirvana, and it is one
of being, still there in its subtlest form. So if Buddha moves from town
to town, he does so out of compassion and not out of bliss. It is his
compassion that takes him to people to tell them that they too can long
for, strive for and attain what he himself has attained.</p><p><br></p><p>But when Krishna goes to the people he does so out of his bliss and
not out of compassion. Compassion is not his forte.</p><p><br></p><p>Compassion is the ruling theme in the life of Buddha. It is out of
sheer compassion that he moves from place to place for forty years. But
he awaits the moment when this movement will come to an end and he will
be free of it all. That is why he says that there are two kinds of
nirvana, one which comes with samadhi and the other with the death of
the body. With nirvana the mind ceases to be, and with Mahanirvana the
body too ceases to be. This he calls sovereign nirvana, that which
brings supreme emptiness with it.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not so with Krishna. With him, nirvana and mahanirvana go hand
in hand.</p><p><br></p><p>If we want to be fully alive, if we want to live a rich and full
life, we should be ready to invite and face any number of new and living
problems. And we will live a morbid and dead life if we try to be
finished with all our problems for good. Problems are necessary, but
they must always be new and live problems, and man should have will,
confidence and courage to meet them squarely and solve them. That is
what makes for real life. And there is no reason why man should not
solve them.</p><p><br></p><p>Our present social setup is based wholly on fear – fear of all kinds.
There is fear in its very foundation; it is fear-oriented from A to Z.
We are afraid of everything around us and this fear inhibits us, does
not allow us to step out of our age-old limitations. And we never think
of what a mess we have made of our life and living. Fear of what is
going to happen prevents us from taking any new steps forward,</p><p>and so we refuse to see the actual state of our affairs. Because if
we see what really is, we will be compelled to change the old for the
new; the old is so rotten. But our fear of the new fetters our feet and
we go on dragging with the old.</p><p><br></p><p>I have had occasion to come into contact with hundreds of thousands
of people and I observed them very closely, I really peeked into their
hearts and minds. And I say I did not find a single person, man or
woman, who is satisfied with his or her marriage and who is not steeped
in misery on account of it. But if you point out their reality to them,
they will immediately enumerate the various problems that will arise if
they try to do something about it. The irony is that they are already
ridden with problems, but they are not aware of them because they have
become so used to them.</p><p><br></p><p>It is as if we ask a bird in a cage to fly into the open sky and it
says that it is so secure in its cage, whereas the freedom of the sky
will create so many problems for it. If you make a change, problems are
bound to arise. And so far as the caged bird is concerned, its
difficulties will be enormous, because it has no experience of flying in
the vast sky. Yet a choice has to be made.</p><p><br></p><p>Granted that there is security in the cage, but what worth is this
security in comparison with the freedom and ecstasy of flying in the
open sky? If you think only of security then the grave is the most
secure place on the earth.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 4</p><p><br></p><p>QUESTIONER. SWAMI SAHAJANAND ACCUSES KRISHNA OF CORRUPTING PEOPLE
RATHER THAN LIBERATING THEM THROUGH HIS PATH OF SENSUOUS ENJOYMENT. AND
HE OFFERS TWO REASONS IN SUPPORT OF HIS ACCUSATION. FIRSTLY, IF ONE
WORSHIPS KRISHNA AS A GOPI-LIKE DEVOTEE THIS WORSHIP IS LIKELY TO
DEGENERATE INTO SOMETHING LIKE THE MAHARAJ LIBEL CASE OF GUJARAT. AND
SECONDLY, IF ONE TURNS LIFE INTO A CELEBRATION IN KRISHNA’S WAY IT WILL
GIVE IMPETUS TO MAN’S DESIRE FOR INDULGENCE.</p><p><br></p><p>There is yet another question arising from the same source. Question
5</p><p>IS NOT THE WAY OF RAMA’S DEVOTEE SUPERIOR TO THAT OF KRISHNA’S?
VIRTUES LIKE CELIBACY, DETACHMENT, DYNAMISM AND WISDOM ASSOCIATED WITH
HANUMANA – A CHIEF DEVOTEE OF RAMA – ARE LACKING IN THE DEVOTEES OF
KRISHNA LIKE MEERA, NARSI AND SURDAS, WHO ARE ALL INTROVERTS
DISINTERESTED IN THE SERVICE OF SOCIETY.</p><p><br></p><p>AND LASTLY I WANT TO KNOW WHY PAINTERS OF THEIR TIMES DID NOT SHOW
RAMA, KRISHNA, MAHAVIRA AND BUDDHA WITH BEARDS AS THEY DID IN THE CASE
OF JESUS CHRIST.</p><p><br></p><p>Firstly, let us find out whether life is a schedule of duties and
works to be performed, or it is a celebration. If life is work, a duty,
then it is bound to turn into a burden, a drag, and we will have to go
through it, as we do, with a heavy heart. Krishna does not take life as
work, as duty; he takes it</p><p>as a celebration, a festivity. Life is really a great feast, a
blissful festivity. It is not homework, not a task that has to be
performed willy nilly.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not that someone will cease to work if he takes life as a
celebration. He will certainly work, but his work will be a part of the
festivity, it will have the flavor of celebration. Then work will happen
in the company of singing and dancing. It is true there will not be too
much work, it will be less in quantity, but in quality it will be
superb. Quantitatively the work will be less, but qualitatively it is
going to be immeasurable.</p><p><br></p><p>You must have noticed how people who are addicted to work, who turn
everything into work, have filled life with tension and only tension.
All anxieties of life are the handiwork of the workoholics; they have
turned life into a workshop. Their slogan is, do or die. They say, “Do
something as long as you are alive, or die if you cannot do anything.”
They have no other vision of life except work. And they don’t have even
a right perspective of work. Work for what? Why does man work?</p><p><br></p><p>Man works so he can live. And what does living mean? To live means to
celebrate life. We work so that we can have a moment of dance in our
lives. Really, work is just a means to celebrate life.</p><p><br></p><p>But the irony is that the way we live there is no leisure left to
sing and dance and celebrate life. We turn means into an end; we make
work the be-all and end-all of life. And then life is confined between
two places, our home and the office. Home to office and back home is all
we know of life. In fact, home ceases to be a home, we bring our office
home with us after we leave it in the evening. Then psychologically we
are in a mess; we live an entangled life, a confused and listless life.
Then we keep running for the rest of our lives in the hope that someday
we will have time to relax, rest and enjoy life. But that day really
never comes; it will never come. Really, workoholics will never know
that there is rest and joy and bliss in life.</p><p><br></p><p>Krishna takes life as festivity, as a play, fun. It is how flowers,
birds and stars take life. Except man, the whole world takes life as
play, fun. Ask a flower why it blooms. For what? It blooms without a
purpose. A star moves across the sky without a purpose. And
purposelessly the wind blows, and keeps blowing. Except man, everything
under the sun is a play, a carnival. Only man works and toils and sheds
copious tears. Except man, the whole cosmos is celebrating. Every moment
of it is celebration.</p><p><br></p><p>Krishna brings this celebration into the life of man. He says, let
man be one with this cosmic celebration.</p><p><br></p><p>It does not mean that there will be no work if we turn life into a
celebration. It is not that the wind does not work; it is always moving,
blowing. It is not that the stars are idle; they are constantly moving.
It is not that flowers don’t do anything when they bloom; really, they
do a lot. But for them, doing it is not that important; what is
important is being. Being is primary and doing is secondary for them.
Celebration comes first and work takes a back seat in their lives. Work
is preparatory to celebration.</p><p><br></p><p>If you go and watch the way the primitive tribes live, you will know
what work is in relation to celebration. They work the whole day so they
can sing and dance with abandon at night. But the civilized man works
not only in the day, but also at night. He takes pride in working day
and</p><p>night. And if you ask him why he works, he will say that he works
today so he can relax tomorrow. He postpones relaxation and continues to
work in the hope that he will relax some day. But that day never comes
for him.</p><p><br></p><p>I am in complete agreement with Krishna’s vision of life, which is
one of celebration. I am a celebrationist. May I ask what man has
achieved by working day in and day out? It is different if he works for
the love of work, but I would like to know what he has achieved so far
by working meaninglessly?</p><p><br></p><p>There is the story of Sisyphus in Greek mythology. He was a king who
was condemned by the gods to push a heavy stone uphill and, when it
rolled down the hill, to begin again. Time and again Sisyphus had to
carry the stone from the base of the hill to its top; this is what “an
uphill task” means. A workoholic is a Sisyphus endlessly pushing a stone
uphill and beginning again when it rolls down. He is now engaged in
pushing the stone uphill and then chasing it when it rolls down and then
beginning to push it up again. And he never comes to know a moment of
leisure and joy in all his life.</p><p><br></p><p>These workoholics have turned the whole world into a madhouse.
Everyone is mad with running and reaching somewhere. And no man knows
where this “somewhere” is. I have heard that a man got into a taxi and
asked the driver to drive fast. And the taxi sped. After a little while
the driver inquired where he had to go, and the man said, “That is not
the question, I have to go fast.”</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone in the world is running like him, everyone is hurrying
through life. “Hurry up,” has become our watchword. But no one asks,
“Where are we going?” We work hard, but we don’t know why we work so
hard. One does not even have time to think why he is toiling day in and
day out. He is running just because his neighbor is running, his friends
are running, the whole world is running. Everyone is running for fear of
being left behind the other runners.</p><p><br></p><p>His son said, “It is true, as I learned from your life, that wealth
is not happiness, but I also learned from your life that if one has
wealth, one can have the suffering of his choice, one can choose between
one suffering and another. And this freedom of choice is beautiful. I
know that you were never happy, but you always chose your own kind of
suffering. A poor man does not have this freedom, this choice; his
suffering is determined by circumstances. Except this, there is no
difference between a rich man and a poor man in the matter of suffering.
A poor man has to suffer with a woman who comes his way as his wife, but
the rich man can afford women with whom he wants to suffer. And this
choice is not an insignificant happiness.”</p><p><br></p><p>If you examine it deeply, you will find that happiness and suffering
are two aspects of the same thing, two sides of the same coin, or,
perhaps, they are different densities of the same phenomenon.</p><p><br></p><p>The workoholics have done immense harm to the world. And the greatest
harm they have done is that they have deprived life of its moments of
celebration and festivity. It is because of them that there is so little
festivity in the world, and every day it is becoming more and more dull
and dreary and miserable.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, entertainment has taken the place of celebration in the
present world. But entertainment is quite different from celebration;
entertainment and celebration are never the same. In celebration</p><p>you are a participant; in entertainment you are only a spectator. In
entertainment you watch others playing for you. So while celebration is
active, entertainment is passive. In celebration you dance, while in
entertainment you watch someone dancing, for which you pay him. But
there is a world of difference between dancing and watching a dance
performed by a group of professionals who are paid for it. You work hard
during the day, and when you are tired in the evening you go to a
concert to watch others dancing. It is all you can do, but it is not
even an apology for celebration.</p><p><br></p><p>Albert Camus has said that the time is very near when we will have
servants to make love on our behalf, because we don’t have time for
love. We are so busy we don’t have time for love; we will employ others
to do this job for us. Love is a celebration, but for workoholics it has
become a superfluous thing. It does not yield any profits; it does not
add to their bank balances. Love is an end unto itself; it cannot be
turned into a business. So those who are addicted to work think it a
waste of time to indulge in love. A kind of secretary can be asked to
deal with it and dispose of it.</p><p><br></p><p>Obsession with work has taken away the moments of celebration from
our life, and we have been deprived of the excitement and thrill that
comes with celebration. That is why nobody is happy, nobody is cheerful,
nobody is blossoming. That is why suffering has become the badge of
mankind.</p><p><br></p><p>We had to find a substitute for celebration, and entertainment is
that substitute, because we do need a few moments of relaxation, a brief
spell of diversion. But entertainment is a very poor substitute, because
others do it and we are only spectators. It is like the vicarious
pleasure we derive from watching someone in love. This is precisely what
you do when you watch a movie. You watch a man and woman loving each
other and you enjoy it vicariously. It is a false substitute; it is
utterly useless. It is not going to give you a taste of love; it is not
going to satiate your thirst for love. On the other hand, your
disaffection and torment will deepen and land you in still greater
misery.</p><p><br></p><p>For God’s sake, know love directly, enter into it, and only then you
will be satiated and happy. Real love alone can make life festive,
entertainment won’t.</p><p><br></p><p>Krishna is all for celebration; he takes life as a great play, a
mighty drama. The work-addicts have, instead of doing any good to the
world, only created confusion and complication in the life of man. They
have made life so complex that living has become extremely hard and
painful.</p><p><br></p><p>It is true that devotees of Rama, like Hanumana, seem to be strong,
active and sincere people, the devotees of Krishna are not so. Meera
goes about dancing and singing, but she does not seem to be as dynamic
as Hanumana. She cannot be. The reason is that while Rama takes life
seriously, believes life is all work, Krishna is non-serious and takes
life as a dance, a celebration. And life as celebration is a different
thing altogether. Life as work pales in insignificance before it. If you
are asked to spend twenty-four hours in the company of Hanumana you will
think twice. You would want to run away from him if you were made to
live in the same room with him for a long while. But you can live with
Meera joyfully for any length of time.</p><p><br></p><p>It is true that Krishna’s lovers gradually withdrew themselves from
the world of outer activity, from the world of extroversion. They dived
deep into the interiority of life and drank at the fountain of its
bliss. This is as it should be, because Krishna knows how, when you lose
yourself in its outer activities, you are missing life itself.</p><p>It will be a peaceful and happy world that will abound with Meeras.
And a world full of Hanumanas will be a restless and warring world, a
sorry world. If it comes into being, wrestling rings will appear all
over and society will be ridden with conflict and strife. We can
accommodate one or two Hanumanas; more than that would be too much. But
any number of Meeras will be welcome. Meera is in contact with life at
its deeper levels; Hanumana lives at the surface. Hanumana is nothing
more than a faithful servant, a volunteer; he is just serving his
master. He is, of course, sincere, persevering and hard-working. Meera
is a class by herself; she is rare. Her bliss, her ecstasy comes from
being, not from doing. For her, just being is festive and joyous. Her
song, her dance, is not a piece of work for her, it is an expression of
her bliss, her ecstasy. She is so blissful that she is bursting into
song and dance.</p><p><br></p><p>I would like this world to be more and more filled with song and
dance, with music and festivity. And so far as the external world, the
world of extroversion and action is concerned, we should go into it only
to the extent needed for our inward journey. More than that is not
necessary. We need bread, but bread is not everything. We need bread to
live, but there are people who go on stockpiling bread and, in the
meantime, forget all about eating and living. By the time they succeed
in making a mountain of bread their appetite is gone and they don’t know
what to do with the huge stock.</p><p><br></p><p>When Alexander was leaving for India he went to see Diogenes, a great
sage of the times. Diogenes asked Alexander, “Where are you going and
for what?”</p><p><br></p><p>Alexander said, “I am going to conquer Asia Minor first.”</p><p><br></p><p>Then Diogenes queried, “And what will you do after conquering Asia
Minor?” “I will then go to conquer India,” said the would-be
conqueror.</p><p>“And what then?” asked the sage.</p><p><br></p><p>And the answer was, “I have to conquer the whole world.”</p><p><br></p><p>Diogenes was Lying on the sandy bank of a river; he was completely
naked and enjoying the morning sunshine. He asked again, “What will you
do after you have conquered the world?”</p><p><br></p><p>Alexander said, “Then I will rest and relax.”</p><p><br></p><p>This reply of Alexander’s sent Diogenes into loud laughter, and he
called his companion, his dog, who was sitting some distance from him.
When the dog came to him Diogenes said, addressing the dog, “Listen to
what this mad king is saying. This man says that he will rest after he
conquers the world. And here we are resting right now without conquering
a single place.” And he said to Alexander, “If rest is your ultimate
objective, why not join me and my dog right now on this beautiful river
bank? There is enough space here for us all. I am already resting. Why
ate you going to create so much trouble and disturbance around the world
just to rest at the end of it all? You can rest right here and now.”</p><p><br></p><p>An embarrassed Alexander then said, “What you say seems to be very
sensible, but I cannot rest right now. Let me first conquer the
world.”</p><p>And then the sage said, “There is no connection whatsoever between
world conquest and rest. Here I am, resting well, without having to go
in conquest of the world.”</p><p><br></p><p>What Diogenes told Alexander at the end of their dialogue proved to
be prophetic. He said, “You will in fact, turn back mid-journey. Who has
ever returned after completing his journey?” On his way back from India
the conqueror died; he could not reach Greece.</p><p><br></p><p>All Alexanders die, and die mid journey. They gather wealth but don’t
have the time to enjoy it. They do everything to collect all the
instruments of an orchestra, and when everything is ready they find to
their despair that they have lost the capacity to play them. Their hands
are empty and they can’t do anything but weep. Alexander died empty
handed.</p><p><br></p><p>No, life is meant to be a celebration; celebration is its central
note. If someone asks you, better ask this question of yourself: “Do I
live to work or work to live?” Then the answer will become very clear to
you, and you will move much closer to Krishna. You do everything so you
live, and not so you live to work and work meaninglessly. And to live
you don’t need to do much; too much doing has no meaning.</p><p><br></p><p>If this attitude that we work to live gains ground, much of our
trouble and misery will disappear. Most of our troubles arise from our
madness to do too much, and if this madness goes, there will be much
more peace and joy and cheer in the world than we have at the moment.
With the disappearance of overdoing, many things will disappear –
tension and anxiety will disappear, mental diseases and madhouses will
disappear. This much harm it will do, if you take it as harm. It will be
a sane world indeed.</p><p><br></p><p>Therefore I say that I am in complete accord with Krishna’s festive
vision of life.</p><p><br></p><p>You also want to know why all the avataras and Tirthankaras of this
country, like Rama, Krishna, Mahavira and Buddha, have been portrayed
without beards. What may the reasons be?</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t think all of them were without beards; one or two might have
been exceptions to the rule. It is not factual that they did not have
beards, yet it is true that not one of them has been portrayed with a
beard. There must be reasons for it.</p><p><br></p><p>Firstly, the time before one grows a beard is the freshest and finest
time of his life. That is the peak moment of life’s freshness; after
that it begins to decline. But as far as men like Krishna are concerned
we saw them as the very picture of that freshness, of that infinite
freshness, and saw that they retained this freshness through their whole
lives. There is never a point of decline in their freshness; they are
always young and new. Not that they don’t age and grow old. They all
age, but as far as their consciousness is concerned it is always in the
adolescent state. Their consciousness is eternally young, eternally new,
eternally fresh.</p><p><br></p><p>These paintings and portraits of Rama, Krishna, Mahavira and Buddha
that we see without beards, do not represent their persons; they
represent their spirit, their soul, their consciousness. We saw a
constant freshness, youthfulness, accompanying them through their
childhood, their youth and old age, and we captured that freshness in
our paintings and pictures of them.</p><p>We can never think of Krishna as an old man leaning on a cane. He
must have grown to old age, for he lived long, but we fail to imagine
how he looked as an old man. There is something in him which is
eternally young and alive.</p><p><br></p><p>On the other hand there are children who seem to be born old.
Recently I visited a town where a young girl met me – she was hardly
thirteen or fourteen years old – and she said that she wanted moksha,
liberation. Now this girl is already an old woman, and I told her so.
She has yet to live life and she talks of liberation. She has yet to be
in bondage and she wants to be free of it. She told me that she belongs
to a family where everyone is religious. I even visited her family,
which was really a religious family – sad, somber and dead. Everyone in
that family was waiting for moksha; no one had time to live. Her father
looked dead, her mother looked dead; even the youngsters of the family
looked anemic and ill. It seemed to me they were living in the shadow of
fasting and starvation; they were dissipated and dead.</p><p><br></p><p>Naturally this girl has grown old, and if an artist paints a picture
of her he would not want to show her as a young woman. That would be an
inauthentic picture. The artist will have to show her as a seventy or
eighty year-old woman. That would be her correct mental age.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha, Mahavira, Krishna and Rama are ever young, really adolescent.
We could have painted them as twenty-five years old as well. That is the
age of youth, but then they would have to be shown with beards. But we
portrayed them as teenagers without beards and mustaches. ’Why? There is
a reason for this too. It was not proper to portray them as twenty five
year-olds with beards and mustaches, because that would have shown they
were on their way to Qld age. Once a thing begins, it necessarily has to
come to an end. You cannot portray the eternally young with beard and
mustache; that would defeat the very purpose. So adolescence is the
right age in which to show them, because it is the prime time of
newness.</p><p><br></p><p>There is yet another reason why men like Krishna are shown without
beards. Man’s concept of beauty is feminine; it is derived from the
beauty of women. For him, woman, and not man, is the image of beauty.
And most of our painters and sculptors, our poets and our writers of
scriptures have been men. Naturally if they have to depict someone as
handsome, beautiful, they will do so in terms of feminine beauty. So if
Krishna has to be portrayed as a beautiful person – and he is superb;
who can be more beautiful than him? – he will certainly be shown in
exquisite feminine beauty. That is why statues and portraits of Buddha,
Krishna and others like him have feminine faces. Their images are
distinctly feminine; they are fat from masculine, because man’s
understanding of beauty comes from his appreciation of woman’s
beauty.</p><p><br></p><p>It is for this reason that with the growth of man’s aesthetic sense,
all the world over, he began to shave his beard and mustache. First, he
removed them from the faces of Krishna and Buddha, and then from his
own. Because he believes that woman’s face is much more beautiful than
his own, he has been trying to imitate her in various ways.</p><p><br></p><p>But woman’s concept of beauty is quite different; her concept of
beauty is masculine, is based on her appreciation of man’s beauty. A
woman is not attracted by another woman’s beauty, she is always
attracted by the beauty of man. Her image of beauty comes from the man’s
face. So I think if women had painted pictures of Krishna and Buddha
they would definitely have shown them with beards and mustaches.</p><p>I don’t think that even today women like men with shaved faces; they
look feminine to them. The beard and mustache are symbols of masculinity
for women. Just think how you would react to a woman who appears before
you with a beard and mustache on her face; she will be repelling. In the
same way a man without a beard and mustache should repel a woman.
Whether she says so or not is another thing, because women don’t have
even this much freedom. that they can express their likes and dislikes.
Even their ways of thinking are determined by men; they cannot assert
their own preferences.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember, whenever and wherever masculine beauty manifests itself in
its full grandeur, beards and mustaches return to men’s faces. It has
always been that masculine beauty gains its peak with the return of the
beard and mustache. But when man begins to imitate women, he shaves his
beard and thus loses a part of his masculinity.</p><p><br></p><p>It is ironic that women are out to imitate men on a very large scale.
This craze has become almost worldwide. Women now want to dress in jeans
like men, because their concept of beauty is based on their appreciation
of the male look. They like to wear watches on their wrists exactly as
men do. They are taking to men’s professions for the same reason. They
think that man is the picture of beauty and strength. Their whole lib
movement is moving in the direction of imitating man. And if someday
they win – there is every likelihood that they will win, because men
have dominated long, and they must now quit so that women take center
stage – it will not be surprising to see women wearing beards and
mustaches. Today we cannot even think of it; it seems quite unthinkable.
But they have already started wearing beards and mus taches in subtler
ways; they are doing their very best to imitate men in every way. They
want to look like men; they are out to become carbon copies.</p><p><br></p><p>But whether men imitate women or women imitate men, it is ugly and
absurd. It is utterly stupid. Imitation itself is stupid.</p><p><br></p><p>Painters and sculptors who portrayed Krishna, Rama and Buddha, were
men, admirers of feminine beauty, and for this very reason none of these
portraits can be said to be authentic. If you see the statues of the
twenty four Jaina tirthankaras you will be surprised to find that they
are all alike, that there is not the least difference between one and
another. If you remove the different signs engraved at the bottom of
their statues, you cannot tell one from the other; they are exactly the
same. Similarly, there is no difference between the statues of Mahavira
and Buddha other than of clothes. While Mahavira is naked, Buddha is in
clothes. Do you think all of them really looked alike?</p><p><br></p><p>No, it is impossible they all looked alike. It rarely happens that
two persons have exactly the same face, not even twins. But the painters
and sculptors have achieved the miracle. How? The painter engaged in
portraying Buddha is doing his best to make his portrait the most
beautiful even. The sculptor of Mahavira’s statue works with the same
objective in mind. And the net result of this effort of theirs to
achieve perfection in beauty is that their images turn out alike.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 6</p><p><br></p><p>QUESTIONER: YOU SAY THAT ONE SHOULD WORK ONLY ENOUGH TO LIVE, NOT
MORE THAN THAT. IF THIS ATTITUDE TOWARDS WORK BECOMES PREVALENT, MEERA
WILL CEASE TO HAVE A TANPOORA, AN INSTRUMENT IN HER HANDS AND WE WILL
NOT BE ABLE TO RECORD YOUR DISCOURSES. THE TANPOORA AND THE TAPE
RECORDER ARE</p><p>THE FRUITS OF HUMAN LABOR. SO WE QUESTION AS: HOW WILL POVERTY GO IF
MAN ACCEPTS CELEBRATION AS THE WAY OF LIFE?</p><p><br></p><p>It is worth considering whether Meera’s tanpoora is the handiwork of
work addicts or of those who take celebration as a way of life.
Work-addicts don’t produce a tanpoora, they produce a spade. The
tanpoora has no connection with work; the exponents of work produce a
hammer, a hatchet and a sword. The tanpoora is the creation of those who
take life as play, fun. Whatever is superb in human creation, be it a
tanpoora of a Taj Mahal, is the gift of those whose way of life is
celebration. These things of beauty arise from their dreams and
fantasies.</p><p><br></p><p>It is natural that men and women who take life as celebration should
accept the help of those who take life as work and toil. But the
work-addicts can also take their work as a play, and then the quality of
their work will be very different, and so will be the quality of their
lives and ways of living. I think the laborers who put the marble of the
Taj Mahal together never knew the joy that a mere look at this marvelous
piece of architecture brings to you. For the laborers who built the Taj
it was merely work, a means of livelihood. But was it not possible that
the same marble could have been put together in a celebrative way?</p><p><br></p><p>I love to tell this story again and again. A temple is under
construction on the outskirts of a town and a few laborers are busy
cutting stones for it. A passerby stops to see what is being built. He
goes to one of the laborers and asks, “What are you doing?”</p><p><br></p><p>The man was sad and serious, even looked angry with himself. Without
raising his gaze to the visitor the laborer said, “Don’t you see I am
cutting stones?”</p><p><br></p><p>The visitor moved to another laborer, and put the same question to
him, “What are you doing?”</p><p><br></p><p>This man looked sad too, but was not angry. He put down his hammer
and chisel, raised his eyes to the visitor, said glumly, “I am earning
my bread,” and resumed his work.</p><p><br></p><p>The visitor moved to a third workman who was engaged in the same kind
of work near the main gate of the temple. He was in a happy mood,
singing. “What are you doing, my friend?” the passerby asked of him
too.</p><p><br></p><p>And the man said in a very pleasant voice, “I am constructing a
temple.” And then he resumed his stone cutting and his singing.</p><p><br></p><p>All three workmen are engaged in the same job, stone-cutting, but
their attitude to work is quite different from one another. As far as
the third workman is concerned he has turned work into a celebration; he
can work and sing together.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t say don’t abolish poverty, don’t have technology and
affluence. All I say is that you can create technology and wealth by way
of celebration; It is not necessary to treat them as duty and work. The
affluence that comes with celebration has a beauty of its own You can
abolish poverty through hard and painful work, but you will remain poor
in spite of your wealth. Poverty of the spirit cannot go until you turn
work into a celebration. Maybe the way of celebration will take more
time, but it will abolish both kinds of poverty – material and
spiritual.</p><p>It is really a question of our attitude towards what we do. And with
the change of attitude, with work turning into a celebration, the whole
milieu of life changes.</p><p><br></p><p>A gardener works in your garden; it is his livelihood. He does not
take his work as celebration. But he can no one can prevent him if he
chooses to change his attitude. Granted that he has to earn his bread,
that he must earn his bread, but at the same time he can enjoy his work,
he can celebrate with the blossoming flowers, he can sway and sing with
them. Who comes in his way except himself, except his attitude towards
work? And curiously, he does not earn a lot by taking his work as a
means to an end. But if he takes his work joyfully, if he rejoices with
the blooming flowers, if celebration becomes primary and work secondary,
he will attain to a richness of life he has never known. Then the same
gardening will bring him a blissfulness he will never know
otherwise.</p><p><br></p><p>Poverty should go, suffering should go, but they should go to enable
man to take part in the celebration of life As long as a man remains
poor, it is hard for him to celebrate life, to participate in its
festival. That is why I stand for the abolition of poverty. To me,
elimination of poverty does not mean merely providing the poor with
food, clothes and shelter. It is necessary, but it is not all. In my
view, unless man’s physical needs are fulfilled, he cannot raise his
sights to the higher need of life, to the fulfillment of spirit, soul,
call it what you may. Bread can only fill his belly; to fulfill his
spirit he badly needs the milieu of joy and festivity in his life.</p><p><br></p><p>And if we direct our attention to the higher realms of life, to soul
or spirit, then we can turn all work into celebration. Then we will
plough a field and sing a song together; we will sow and dance together.
Until recently, this was the way of life all over. The farmer worked on
his farm and also sang a song. The worker in a modern factory has lost
that magic, and consequently his work has ceased to be joyful, it is
dull and listless. The factory is only a workshop; it knows nothing but
seven hours of work for which the worker is paid adequately or
inadequately. That is why, when a worker returns home in the evening
after a day’s toil, he is dead tired, broken and unhealed.</p><p><br></p><p>But I tell you, sooner or later song is going to enter the precincts
of the factory. Great studies are underway in many advanced countries
and this realization is dawning on them, that work should cease to be
work alone, that it has to be pleasant and joyful. The day is not far
off when factories will resound with music, because without it man will
be more and more empty and unhappy. And the introduction of music in
factories will not only bring some joy to their work men, it will add to
the quality of their work.</p><p><br></p><p>A housewife cooks in her home. She can cook in the way a cook in some
hotel does. But then it will be work, dull and tiring. But she can also
cook as a woman cooks for her lover who is to visit her. Then cooking is
a celebration which never tires you. Really, such work is highly
fulfilling. But mere work is going to tire you, exhaust you, leave you
utterly empty.</p><p><br></p><p>It is really a matter of our attitude towards what we do. Question
7</p><p>QUESTIONER: YOU SAID THAT KRISHNA HAD GONE BEYOND MIND, AND YOU ALSO
SAID THAT, IMPELLED BY THE NATURAL INSTINCTS OF THE MIND, HE DEPRIVED
THE GOPIS OF THEIR CLOTHES. HOW IS IT THAT A PERSON WHO HAS TRANSCENDED
THE MIND ACTS</p><p>THROUGH IT? AND IF IT IS SO, IS IT ANY DIFFERENT FROM THE INSTINCTUAL
BEHAVIOR OF ANIMALS?</p><p><br></p><p>When I say Krishna has gone beyond mind it does not mean that he is
not left with a mind. To go beyond the mind means that one has known
that which is beyond mind. Mind remains even after you have transcended
it, but it is a different mind altogether, it is a mind cleansed and
stilled and saturated with the beyond. Krishna is larger than his mind,
but the mind has a place in him.</p><p><br></p><p>Transcendence of mind can be attempted in two ways. If you try to
transcend it through suppression, through fight, the mind will be
divided and torn, it will degenerate into a schizophrenic mind. But if
you transcend it in a friendly way, through love and understanding, the
mind will be integrated and settled in wisdom.</p><p><br></p><p>When I say that I have transcended my body it does not mean that I am
not my body, or that my body has ceased to be, it only means that I am
now not only my body, but much more than it. I am body plus something,
something has been added to it. Until yesterday I thought I was only the
body, but now I know that I am something more than the body. I remain
the body; that “something plus” has not eliminated it, rather it has
highly enhanced and enriched it. Now I have also a soul; I am both body
and soul.</p><p><br></p><p>In the same way, when I come to know God it does not mean that my
soul or spirit has ceased to be, it only means that I am now body,
spirit and God all together. Then mind and soul are absorbed in that
which is immense, which is infinite. It is not a matter of losing
something, it is gaining more and more all the way up.</p><p><br></p><p>So when I say that Krishna has gone beyond mind I mean to say that he
has known that which is beyond the mind, he has known the immense, the
eternal. But he continues to have a mind, a mind with heightened
sensitivity and awareness. Krishna is not inimical to mind; he has not
transcended it by way of fight and suppression, he has gone beyond it by
living with it in a very friendly way. Therefore I say that whatever
happens between him and his girlfriends is the spontaneous outpouring of
his exceedingly innocent mind; he cannot but act naturally, innocently
and spontaneously.</p><p><br></p><p>Mind is unnatural when it is in conflict, when it is fighting with
itself. Mind is unnatural when one of its fragments says do this and
another says don’t do this. And when the whole mind is together,
integrated and one, then everything it does becomes natural, then
whatever happens or does not happen is natural and spontaneous. Then
there is nothing unnatural about it. And what is natural is right. But
you have rightly asked: If it is so what is the difference between man
and animal?</p><p><br></p><p>In one respect there is no difference whatsoever between man and
animal, and in another respect the difference is great. The animal is
natural and innocent, but it is not aware of it. Krishna is natural and
innocent, but he is also aware of it. In respect to their naturalness
and innocence Krishna and the animal are very similar, but with regard
to their consciousness there is a tremendous difference.</p><p><br></p><p>An animal moves and acts instinctively, spontaneously and naturally,
lives in a state of let-go, but has no awareness of it, all its acts are
mechanical. Krishna also lives in a state of let-go, allows his nature
free and full play, but he is fully aware of it. His witnessing center
is always alert and aware of everything that happens in and around him.
The animal has no witnessing center.</p><p>While Krishna has gone beyond mind, the animal is below the level of
mind. The animal does not have a mind, it has only a body and instincts
and it functions mechanically. So there is a kind of similarity between
one who is above mind and one who is below it.</p><p><br></p><p>There is an old saying prevalent among sages that when one attains to
the highest wisdom he becomes like the most ignorant person on the
earth. There is some truth in this saying.</p><p><br></p><p>One of the sages of ancient India is known as Jarbharat, which
literally means Bharat the Ignorant. Really, he was one of the wisest
sages of this country, but he was named Jarbharat, Bharat the Ignorant,
because he looked like an extremely ignorant person. In a way perfect
wisdom looks like perfect ignorance; at least in perfection they are
similar. A man of wisdom is at rest, because he has known everything,
nothing remains to be known. An ignorant person is also at rest, because
he does not know a thing. To be restless it is necessary to know a
little. An animal functions very unconsciously; Krishna functions with
full awareness. Nothing happens to him in unawareness.</p><p><br></p><p>That is why we say when someone attains to the highest wisdom he
becomes like a child. Somebody asks Jesus, “How is your kingdom of God?
How is one who attains to God?”</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus says, “One who attains to God becomes like a child.” But Jesus
does not say that a child attains to God. If it were so all children
would attain to God. He does not say that one who attains to God becomes
a child, he says he becomes like a child. If he says that a sage becomes
a child, it would mean that a child has perfect wisdom, which is not the
case. If children were perfect we need not do anything with them. No,
the child is below the level of the developed mind, while the sage has
gone beyond. The child will have to pass through a phase of conflict,
tension and struggle; the sage has outlived all conflicts and tensions.
The child potentially carries with him all the sicknesses man is heir
to; the wise man has outlived such sicknesses. In the course of
evolution even the animal will have to pass through all the sicknesses
of man. But here is Krishna who has outlived them, transcended them,
gone beyond them.</p><p><br></p><p>The similarity and difference between man and animal are
well-defined. Question 8</p><p>QUESTIONER: YOU TALKED ABOUT SWADHARMA, SELF-NATURE, THE INNATE
INDIVIDUALITY OF MAN. THE GEETA SAYS THAT ONE’S OWN NATURE, EVEN IF IT
BE INFERIOR IN QUALITY, IS PREFERABLE TO AN ALIEN NATURE OF SUPERIOR
QUALITY. THEN THE QUESTION IS: HOW CAN SELF-NATURE, WHICH IS ONE’S
INNATE INDIVIDUALITY, BE INFERIOR IN QUALITY?</p><p><br></p><p>Let it be the last question for this discourse, and then we will sit
for meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>You ask how one’s self-nature or the innate individuality can be
inferior in quality. In this connection two things have to be
considered.</p><p><br></p><p>The first. Everything in its origin is without any attribute,
quality; it gathers attributes only after it takes a form and grows.
There is a seed; it has no attributes whatsoever. The seed has just
potentiality; it has no quality other than this. It can give birth to a
flower which is not yet there. Tomorrow it will turn</p><p>into a flower, and then this flower will have certain attributes,
qualities. It will be red in color, it will be fragrant; then it will
have an individuality of its own. But right now, as a seed, there is
nothing in it. It will take on attributes only after it comes to express
itself, after it sprouts, grows and blossoms into a flower.</p><p><br></p><p>The world has many attributes; God has none. God is seed-like; he is
unmanifest. When God manifests himself in the form of the world he
acquires attributes, and these attributes disappear when he again
becomes unmanifest. Someone is a saint and another person is a thief. As
saint and thief they have certain attributes, but when they, the saint
and the thief, go to sleep, they are without any attributes. Neither
does the saint remain a saint nor the thief remain a thief. In sleep all
attributes disappear; sleep is a state without attributes. Attributes
appear with the waking state; with sleep they go to sleep too. When they
wake up the saint will become a saint and the thief will become a thief
again. In sleep we are very close to our individuality, our innate
nature; rather, we are closest to it. And in samadhi, in ecstasy, we
actually attain to our supreme nature, which is of the highest.</p><p><br></p><p>So the experiencing of the pristine nature has no attributes, no
traits whatsoever. But when self- nature manifests itself it acquires
attributes. Attribute and non-attribute are not two things; they are not
contradictory. They are just the ways of the manifest and the
unmanifest.</p><p><br></p><p>Self-nature, supreme nature, has two states. One is the unmanifest
state when it is in seed form, asleep, absorbed in itself. And the other
is the manifest state when it takes form and attributes. Really, no
manifestation can be without form and attributes; it has to have a form,
a shape, a color and a speciality.</p><p><br></p><p>A small story comes to mind, a Zen story. A Zen Master teaches his
disciples how to paint. Painting is the medium through which he really
leads his disciples into meditation. One can travel to meditation from
anywhere and everywhere. There is no point in the world from where you
cannot make a start for meditation. This Master has ten disciples who
are gathered round him one morning. He tells them, “Go and make a
picture whose broad outlines should be like this. There is a cow in a
grassy land, and the cow is grazing. You have to paint it, but remember,
the painting has to have no form, no attributes.”</p><p><br></p><p>The disciples find themselves in great difficulty. It is the job of a
Master to put his disciples in difficulty, in crisis, because only in
crisis can they become aware of themselves. The disciples find it
extremely hard to paint a picture without form and attributes; it seems
an impossible task. They have to use lines and colors. They have to give
the cow some form; they have to show the grass all over the field.</p><p><br></p><p>Nine of the ten disciples attempt to paint and the next day return
with some sort of paintings which don’t have any clearcut outlines,
everything is hazy and unclear. But a sort of cow is there in each
painting. In drawing the grass they certainly made use of abstract art
so it is formless as much as possible. Nevertheless, they have to use
colors of some sort.</p><p><br></p><p>Inspecting each other’s paintings, a disciple asks one of his
friends, “Where is the cow?”</p><p><br></p><p>The other says, “I had some idea of a cow when I was in the process
of painting, but now I cannot say where the cow is.”</p><p>And the Master rejects all nine pictures saying, “How can you have
color and a cow in a painting that has to be without form and
attributes?”</p><p><br></p><p>The tenth disciple has just a blank sheet of paper in his hand, and
the Master says, “Yes, this is it.”</p><p><br></p><p>The nine disciples who have attempted to paint feel disappointed and
they protest, “Where is the cow?”</p><p><br></p><p>The Master says, “The cow went home after grazing.” “And where is the
grass?” they protest further.</p><p>The Master says, “The cow ate it up. So things have gone back to
their original places. Things have returned to their unmanifest state.
This is really painting without form and attributes. It shows a cow who
is finished grazing and a plot of grass the cow has eaten up. Empty
space, just space is there.”</p><p><br></p><p>At its deepest level self nature is without any form, without any
attributes; it is utter emptiness. It becomes manifest with the grass
appearing and the cow coming to graze on it. Then the play of attributes
happens. And it all becomes unmanifest once again after the cow has
eaten up the grass.</p><p><br></p><p>This vast expanse of our world was born out of emptiness, which is
without form, and it will return to the same emptiness. Everything
appears and disappears, but the source is the same emptiness, the
immense void. And the whole is hidden in that emptiness which by its
nature cannot have a name, a shape and an adjective.</p><p><br></p><p>In this sense, self-nature, like everything else, has two states: the
manifest and the unmanifest. While the manifest has a name and form,
attributes, the unmanifest has none whatsoever.</p><p><br></p><p>In the same way we have to see Krishna from two sides, because he has
two sides. His one side is visible and his other side is invisible. The
skeptic will see only the visible, the manifest form of Krishna, but one
who has faith, who is trusting will see the other side too, the
invisible, the unmanifest. Thought, contemplation and logic cannot go
beyond the form, the manifest; but trust, prayer and meditation can
enter the reality, the unseen, the unmanifest. But one who fails to
grasp even the form, the manifest, the gross, can hardly be expected to
reach the formless, the unmanifest, the subtle.</p><p><br></p><p>But thought and logic, rightly used, can take you to the point where
the seen, the manifest ends and the unseen, the unmanifest begins.
Beyond it thought is absolutely useless; beyond it a jump, a leap is a
must. Beyond it you have to get out of your intellect, your mind; you
have to go beyond your own mind, beyond self. Actually you have to
transcend yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>But this transcendence of the mind does not mean that one will cease
to know everything that he has known before. Now all that he has known
before will be absorbed and assimilated in the newly acquired knowledge
of the beyond. The day the manifest and the unmanifest meet and merge
into each other, the ultimate truth comes into being.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part6>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

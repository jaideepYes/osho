‌CHAPTER 1
On Knowing The Eternal Law
21 June 1975 am in Buddha Hall
ON KNOWING THE ETERNAL LAW:
ATTAIN THE UTMOST IN PASSIVITY,
HOLD FIRM TO THE BASIS OF QUIETUDE.
THE MYRIAD THINGS TAKE SHAPE AND RISE TO ACTIVITY, BUT I WATCH THEM FALL BACK TO THEIR REPOSE,
LIKE VEGETATION THAT LUXURIANTLY GROWS
BUT RETURNS TO THE ROOT (SOIL) FROM WHICH IT SPRINGS.</description>

‌CHAPTER 10
Every Buddha Enriches The Universe
30 June 1975 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
WHEN AN ENLIGHTENED BEING DISSOLVES INTO THE COSMOS, DOES HIS UNIQUENESS DISSOLVE ALSO?
The enlightened man, even while he is alive in the body, has already dissolved. He knows that he is no more, he knows that he is a nothingness. The dissolution has already happened. In fact, nothing has dissolved, because nothing had been separate from the very beginning.</description>

‌CHAPTER 2
Choicelessness
22 June 1975 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
SMALL SIDDHARTHA ONCE WISELY SAID THAT OSHO IS A GIRL. MY FEELINGS ALSO. MANY TIMES YOU HAVE SAID AS MUCH, AND YOUR WAYS OF SURRENDER AND PASSIVITY ECHO THE ESSENTIAL FEMALE IN LAO TZU. IF CHOICE WAS POSSIBLE WHY DID YOU ASSUME A MALE FORM FOR YOUR FINAL SHOWDOWN?</description>

‌CHAPTER 3
On The Futility Of Contention
23 June 1975 am in Buddha Hall
ON THE FUTILITY OF CONTENTION
TO YIELD IS TO BE PRESERVED WHOLE. TO BE BENT IS TO BECOME STRAIGHT. TO BE HOLLOW IS TO BE FILLED.
TO BE TATTERED IS TO BE RENEWED. TO BE IN WANT IS TO POSSESS.
TO HAVE PLENTY IS TO BE CONFUSED. THEREFORE THE SAGE EMBRACES THE ONE, AND BECOMES THE MODEL OF THE WORLD.</description>

‌CHAPTER 4
Buddhas And Fools
24 June 1975 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
SOMETIMES YOU CALL US ‘YOU FOOLS’ AND SOMETIMES YOU CALL US ‘YOU BUDDHAS’. ARE FOOLS AND BUDDHAS THE SAME TO YOU?
They are not the same to me but they are both meeting in you right now, shaking hands within you. Your past is the fool, your future is the buddha, and at this moment they are both within you.</description>

WHEN THE HIGHEST TYPE OF MEN HEAR THE TAO (TRUTH), THEY TRY HARD TO LIVE IN ACCORDANCE WITH IT,

‌CHAPTER 6
Discipline And Control
26 June 1975 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
YOU SAID THAT THOSE WHO WANT TO ATTAIN NEED DISCIPLINE AND EFFORT AT FIRST. IS THAT NOT A THING OF THE EGO, AND WILL IT NOT BECOME MORE STRENGTHENED? I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN HARD ON MYSELF AND MISSED MUCH OF THE JOYS OF LIFE. PLEASE EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DISCIPLINE AND CONTROL.</description>

‌CHAPTER 7
On The Softest Substance
27 June 1975 am in Buddha Hall
ON THE SOFTEST SUBSTANCE:
THE SOFTEST SUBSTANCE OF THE WORLD GOES THROUGH THE HARDEST.
THAT-WHICH-IS-WITHOUT-FORM PENETRATES THAT-WHICH-HAS-NO-CREVICE;
THROUGH THIS I KNOW THE BENEFIT OF TAKING NO ACTION. THE TEACHING WITHOUT WORDS
AND THE BENEFIT OF TAKING NO ACTION ARE WITHOUT COMPARE IN THE UNIVERSE.
The other night I was reading a Sufi story – I loved it, I rejoiced in it, it was sheer beauty, and I would like to share it with you.</description>

‌CHAPTER 8
In Existence There Is No Question
28 June 1975 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
AS I HAVE HEARD FROM YOU, THE WHOLE EXISTENCE IS THE ANSWER, NOT THE QUESTION. SO WHEN THE ANSWER EXISTS, NOT THE QUESTION, WHY DOES THE QUESTION COME FROM THE ANSWER?
It does not come from the answer, it comes from you, and it comes from you because you have not seen the answer yet, you have not heard the answer yet.</description>

‌CHAPTER 9
On Calm Quietude
29 June 1975 am in Buddha Hall
ON CALM QUIETUDE:
THE HIGHEST PERFECTION IS LIKE IMPERFECTION, AND ITS USE IS NEVER IMPAIRED.
THE GREATEST ABUNDANCE SEEMS MEAGRE, AND ITS USE WILL NEVER FAIL.
WHAT IS MOST STRAIGHT APPEARS DEVIOUS,
THE GREATEST SKILL APPEARS LIKE CLUMSINESS,
THE GREATEST ELOQUENCE APPEARS LIKE STUTTERING. MOVEMENT OVERCOMES COLD,
(BUT) KEEPING STILL OVERCOMES HEAT</description>

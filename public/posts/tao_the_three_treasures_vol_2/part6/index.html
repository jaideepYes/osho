IS THAT NOT A THING OF THE EGO, AND WILL IT NOT BECOME MORE STRENGTHENED? I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN HARD ON MYSELF AND MISSED MUCH OF THE JOYS OF LIFE. PLEASE EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DISCIPLINE AND CONTROL.\nThere is not only a difference, there is a vast difference: discipline and control are polar opposites.\nControl is from the ego, discipline is from the non-ego; control is manipulating yourself, discipline is to understand yourself; discipline is a natural phenomenon, control is unnatural; discipline is spontaneous, control is a sort of suppression. Discipline needs only understanding – you understand and you act according to your understanding. Discipline has no ideal to follow, discipline has no dogma to follow, discipline is not perfectionistic – discipline leads you by and by towards a wholeness.\nControl is perfectionistic, it has an ideal to be achieved; you have an idea in the mind about how you should be. Control has many shoulds and many should-nots, discipline has none. Discipline is a natural understanding, a flowering.\nThe very word ‘discipline’ comes from a root which means ‘to learn’; it comes from the same root as the word ‘disciple’. A disciple is one who is ready to learn – and discipline is that capacity of openness which helps you to learn.\nDiscipline has nothing to do with control. In fact, a disciplined mind is never a mind which thinks in terms of control, there is no need for it. A disciplined mind needs no control, a disciplined mind is absolutely free.\nAn undisciplined mind needs control because an undisciplined mind feels that without control there is danger. An undisciplined mind cannot trust itself, hence the control. For example: If you don’t control yourself you may kill somebody – in anger, in rage you can be a murderer. You need control, because you are afraid of yourselves.\nA man of understanding, a man who understands himself and others, always feels compassion. Even if somebody is an enemy, a man of understanding has compassion towards him because a man of understanding can understand the viewpoint of the other also. He knows why the other feels as he feels, he knows why the other is angry, because he knows his own self, and in knowing that, he has known all others. He has compassion, he understands, and he follows understanding. When I say this don’t misunderstand me – understanding in fact need not be followed. The very word ‘following’ gives the idea of having to do something: you understand, then you have to do something – follow. No – understand, and everything settles by itself. You need not follow. It starts happening.\nSo the first thing to understand is the difference between control and discipline. Control is a false coin, invented by society as a substitute for discipline. It looks exactly like discipline: every false coin looks that way, otherwise you could not make it current, it could not circulate in the market. There are many false coins about inner life. For example, control is a false coin for the real coin of discipline, and for the real coin of understanding, knowledge is a false coin.\nFor religion, sect is a false coin. To fulfil your need of being religious many false sects are offered to you – Christianity, Hinduism, Jainism. All ‘-isms’ are false. Religion has no ‘-ism’ about it, it is not a dogma. It is something that flowers within you, not something which is enforced from without. Always be aware of the false coins because they are in circulation, and they have been in circulation for so long that people have almost forgotten about the real coins. Religion is neither Christian, nor Hindu, nor Mohammedan; religion is simply religion. It is an attitude which one has to grow into, one cannot be born into it.\nNobody can be religious by birth; it comes through creative effort, it comes through suffering and experience, it comes through wandering and coming home, it comes through going astray and coming back to the right path. Through much suffering and experience, by and by a certain quality of being starts crystallizing within you: that crystalized being is religious and the fragrance that surrounds that crystalized being is religion. It is indefinable.\nThe same is true about control and discipline. Beware of control. Never try to control yourself. Who will control really? If you understand, there is no need to control; if you don’t understand, then who will control? This is the crux of the whole problem.\nIf you understand, what is the need to control? You understand, so you do whatsoever is right. Not that you have to do it, you simply do it because how can you do the wrong? If you are hungry, you don’t start eating stones – you understand that stones cannot be eaten, finished! There is no need to give you a commandment: ‘Never eat stones when you are hungry.’ It will be foolish, simply foolish to say it. When you are thirsty you drink water. What is the need to make any should or should-not about it?\nLife is simple when you understand. There are no regulations or rules around it, there is no need, because your very understanding is the rule of all rules. There is only one golden rule and that is understanding; all other rules are useless, they can be thrown away. If you understand, you can drop all controls, you can be free because whatsoever you do, you will do through understanding.\nIf you ask me the definition of what is right, I will say: That which is done through understanding. Right and wrong have no objective values; there is nothing like a right action and a wrong action, there are only actions done through understanding and actions done through non-understanding. So sometimes it is possible that one action may be wrong this moment and right the next moment because the situation has changed and now the understanding says something else. Understanding is to live moment to moment, with a sensitive response to life.\nYou don’t have a fixed dogma of how to act; you look around, you feel, you see, and then you act out of that feeling, seeing, knowing – the action comes.\nA man of control has no vision of life, he has no sensitivity to life. When the road is right in front of him, open, he consults a map; when the door is just in front of him he asks others: Where is the door? He is blind. Then he has to control himself because the door is changing every moment. Life is not a dead, static thing – it is not. It is dynamic.\nSo the same rule that was good for yesterday will not be good for today and cannot be good for tomorrow. But a man who lives through control has a fixed ideology, he follows his map. Roads go on being changed every day, life goes on moving into new dimensions, but he goes on carrying his old rubbishy ideology. He looks at his idea, then he follows it, and then he is always in the wrong situation.\nThat’s why you feel that you have missed many joys in life. You have to miss, because the only joy that life can give is a response of understanding. Then you feel many joys, but then you don’t have any rules, any ideas, any ideals, then you are not here to follow certain codes – you are here to live and discover your own code of life.\nWhen you become aware of your own code of life, you will see that it is not a fixed thing. It is as dynamic as life itself.\nIf you try to control, it is the ego; it is the ego manipulating you in many ways. Through the ego, society manipulates you, and through society, the dead, all those who are dead now, manipulate you. Every living being, if he follows a dead ideology, is following dead people.\nZarathustra is beautiful, Buddha is beautiful, Lao Tzu is beautiful, Jesus is beautiful – but they are no longer applicable. They lived their lives, they flowered beautifully: learn through them – but don’t be a stupid follower. Be a disciple, but don’t be a student.\nA student learns the word, the dead word; a disciple just learns the secrets of understanding, and when he has his own understanding, he goes on his own way. He pays his respect to Lao Tzu and says: Now I’m ready, I’m grateful, I go my own way. He will always be grateful to Lao Tzu – and this is the paradox: people who have been deadly following Jesus, Buddha or Mohammed can never forgive them. If you miss your joys of life because of them how can you forgive them? How can you\nreally be in gratitude? In fact you are deeply in anger. If you come across them you will kill them, you will murder them because these are the people who have forced you into a controlled life; these are the people who didn’t allow you to live as you would have liked to live; these are the people, Moses and Mohammed, who have given you commandments about how to live. You cannot forgive them. Your gratitude is false. You are so miserable, how can you be grateful? For what? For your misery can you be grateful? No, you can be grateful only when you are blissful.\nGratitude follows like a shadow when you have an inner blessing, a feeling of constant benediction.\nBe a man of discipline but never be a man of control. Then how can you be disciplined? You know only one meaning of discipline and that is being controlled – by yourself or by others. Drop all rules and regulations and live life with a deeper alertness, that’s all. Understanding should be the only law. If you understand you will love, if you love you will not commit any harm to anybody; if you understand you will be happy, if you are happy you will share; if you understand you will become so blissful that from your whole being, continuously as a continuum, like a river, will arise a thankfulness towards existence. That is the prayer.\nTry to understand life, don’t force, and remain always free from the past; because if the past is there and you are controlling, you cannot understand life. And life is so fleeting, it doesn’t wait.\nBut why do people try to make rules? Why do they fall into the trap at all? They fall into the trap because a life of understanding is a life of danger. You have to rely upon yourself. The life of control is comfortable and secure, you need not rely on yourself: Moses will do, the Bible will do, the Koran will do, the Gita will do – you need not bother about the problems, you can escape from them. You take shelter in old words, disciplines, thoughts, you cling to them. This is how you make a comfortable life, a life of convenience – but a life of convenience is not a life of bliss. Then you miss joys because joys are possible only when you live dangerously. There is no other way to live.\nLive dangerously, and when I say ‘live dangerously’ I mean live according to your own self, whatsoever the cost. Whatsoever is at stake, live according to your own consciousness, according to your own heart and feeling.\nIf all security is lost, all comfort and convenience is lost then too you will be happy. You may be a beggar, you may not be a king, you may be on the streets in rags, but no emperor can compete with you. Even emperors will feel jealous of you because you will have a richness, a richness not of things, a richness of consciousness. You will have a subtle light around you and you will have a feeling of blissfulness. Even others can touch that feeling: it is so visible, so substantial, others will be affected by it, it will become a magnet.\nYou may outwardly be a beggar but inwardly you have become a king.\nBut if you live a life of convenience and security and comfort you will avoid danger, you will avoid many difficulties and sufferings; but by avoiding those difficulties and sufferings you will avoid all the bliss that is possible in life. When you avoid suffering you avoid bliss, remember that. When you try to escape a problem you are escaping the solution also. When you don’t want to face a situation you are crippling your own life. Never live a controlled life – that is the life of an escapist – but be disciplined. Disciplined not according to me, not according to anybody, but according to your own\nlight. ‘Be a light unto yourself.’ That was Buddha’s last saying before he died; the last thing that he uttered was, ‘Be a light unto yourself.’ That is discipline.\nThe second question:\nQuestion 2\nBUDDHA USED TO SEND SOMEONE AFRAID OF DEATH TO MEDITATE IN THE CEMETERY, TO MAKE HIM READY FOR REAL MEDITATION. I FEEL MY FEAR OF DEATH AS A BARRIER TO MY MEDITATION. WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO SEND ME?\nThere is no need, you have come to the cemetery. This English word ‘cemetery’, is very beautiful, it comes from the Sanskrit word, SAMADHI. In India SAMADHI means both: the cemetery, the tomb, where a man is buried and also the final realization, the ultimate realization – both, because both are a sort of death.\nWhen you die, it is an ordinary death of the body, but the cluster of the mind survives, goes on taking new births, reincarnates, moves into the wheel of life and death. Ordinary death is not a total death, it is a partial death, a part of you dies; but the remaining part is so powerful that it recreates the dead part, a new body is built again. A new body crystalizes again.\nThen there is the final death. The final death is only that of a Buddha, of one who has known, who has come to know the secret of life, has realized all that life can give – now there is nothing more for him to come back to, he has passed the examination, he returns no more. He dies not only as body, he dies as mind, as ego. He dies completely. There remains only the inner space which becomes one with the outer space; the walls between the inner and the outer disappear.\nWe call that SAMADHI and the English word ‘cemetery’ originated from SAMADHI. No, I am not going to send you anywhere. I am your SAMADHI, your cemetery, here. You can die in me.…\nAn ordinary cemetery won’t do, you can get accustomed to it. There are people who work in the cemetery, who live there, but they have not become enlightened. They have become accustomed, habitual, the whole scene has become routine. Every day people come, dead bodies are carried, they help to bury them or burn them, and that is that. Then they take their food and they go to sleep – they live an ordinary life.\nIf I send you to a cemetery you may be shocked, just in the beginning, you may become afraid because the experience is new. But by and by you will settle into it, it is not going to change you much. So I have called you to me. If you look into me you will find your final cemetery. So now there is no need to send you anywhere else.\nThe third question:\nQuestion 3\nIN ALL MY YEARS OF CATHARSIS IN THERAPY AND IN MEDITATION, I NEVER ‘LOSE CONTROL’. I ALWAYS HAVE A SENSE OF BEING INTO THE FEELING AND ALSO OF WATCHING\nIT. IS THIS BEING ‘SPLIT’ AND NOT-WHOLE? PLEASE EXPLAIN WHAT IS HAPPENING. I HAVE THIS IDEA THAT ONE SHOULD TOTALLY LOSE ONESELF, LET-GO, LOSE CONTROL.…\nThere are two ways to come out of the situation: to lose control completely or to have control completely. There are two paths. One is of deep involvement, so deep that nothing is left behind. For example, Sufis in their Dervish dances involve themselves completely; they are lost, merged.\nThen there is another dimension which is of awareness. Zen people remain alert and aware: carrying water from the well, cutting wood in the forest, eating, sitting, walking, going to sleep, preparing their beds – whatsoever they are doing, they remain completely alert.\nThese are the two ways. Either become completely aware so that whatsoever is happening just becomes objective, you are totally cut off from it, you become a witness. Or, get involved completely so that there is no witness at all, you have become whatsoever is happening – if you are dancing you have become the dance, there is no witness to it. Both lead to the same, because deep down the real thing is not whether you get lost or you remain alert. The real thing is to be total – totally lost or totally aware. In both the cases you fulfil the condition of being total.\nSo don’t think that they are opposites.\nAnd there are two types of people: those who can easily get lost – people of the feeling type, and the other type of people – people of the intellectual type. So one has to remember his own type and find it. If it is difficult for you to lose yourself totally then forget about losing, don’t fight with it. Drop the idea. Maybe you are the intellectual type, then there is a path for you: become aware. Forget the whole idea of losing, dissolving, that is not for you, you be aware. And don’t feel that you are missing something, you will reach the same point from a different route. The same peak will be reached but your path will be different.\nThere are only two types of people, so there are only two types of paths.\nOne is the path of devotion, what in India is called BHAKTI yoga, the path of love and devotion – a Meera, a Chaitanya, dancing and singing, losing themselves completely in the act. When Meera is dancing there is only dance, there is no Meera; the dancer is completely merged into the dance. When Chaitanya is singing and dancing there is no Chaitanya; he has become one with the act.\nThen there is Buddha, Mahavir: they are aware, alert in whatsoever they are doing. They are so alert that the doing is just something outside, it never touches them. They remain untouched. They pass through the water but the water never touches them; they remain uninvolved, uncommitted, unidentified.\nTo me, both are true because I am not a sectarian. If you go to Buddhists they will say: Don’t follow that path of devotion, you will be lost. If you go to the followers of Chaitanya they will say: Don’t listen to this Buddha, because unless you lose yourself how can you attain? You will become egoistic.\nBut I tell you that both the paths lead. The real question is not what path to choose, the real question is what type you are. Just feel your type. And if in years of catharsis in therapy and meditation you have never been able to lose control, then now at least lose the idea of losing control. Try being alert.\nThe fourth question:\nQuestion 4\nYOU SAID THAT ONLY MAN IS VIOLENT AND KILLS FOR SPORT AND THAT ANIMALS KILL FOR FOOD. YET I HAVE WITNESSED DOGS TEARING APART A FOX FOR SPORT; A FOX KILLING NINE CHICKENS AND EATING ONLY ONE – NOT TO MENTION THE RED ANTS VICIOUSLY ATTACKING US DURING MEDITATION. DOES THIS NOT PUT ANIMALS IN THE SAME CATEGORY AS MAN?\nYou must have come across some very highly evolved animals who are going to be born as human beings in their next incarnation. They are almost human.\nDogs are being corrupted by man. Animals which live with man are almost corrupted, they have become human: dogs, cats, and other animals. If you have come across so many situations where you feel that the violence was done for sport, then they are already human beings. Soon you will meet them somewhere in their human form.\nBut I tell you that only man is violent. You may not understand other animals: they may have killed more than they could eat – that only shows they are not doing right arithmetic, that’s all. They might have killed more than they could eat; that simply shows they don’t know how to calculate beforehand. But it is not a sport. They are not doing it just for their enjoyment, no.\nAnd the ants walking on your body when you are meditating are not vicious, they don’t know at all that you are meditating, they don’t know at all that you are. They may be on their own business – ants are very business-like – they may be on their own trip, you are just in their way, that’s all. In fact, you are disturbing them, not they you. You are just sitting there like a rock – you think you are meditating – and you are disturbing their whole route. Ants are great followers of their leaders – the leader has gone one way, so all the ants are going that way. They are always very controlled, they are like the army. So they have to pass you.\nYou think that they are in the way, you think that they are disturbing you; they think that you are just in their way, disturbing them. No, they are not vicious. Nobody is vicious except man, nobody can be, because to be vicious much thinking capacity is needed. To be vicious, one has to think about the future, one has to calculate about the future. To be vicious, one has to think very, very much about the past – past experiences, possibilities, impossibilities – and the future. One has to be cunning, clever. To be vicious, one has to be a disciple of Machiavelli or Chankya. Machiavelli says in his ‘Prince’ that before somebody attacks you, you should attack him, because that is the only defense. Even if the other has not attacked you yet, you have to suspect, and before he attacks, you attack first, because that is the only great defense. If you attack first there is more possibility of winning; if he attacks first there is less possibility of winning.\nMachiavelli says: Don’t trust anybody, not even a friend, because who knows, the friend may become an enemy the next day. So don’t say things to a friend which you would not like to say to the enemy; and don’t say things about the enemy, bad things about the enemy, because who knows, the next day he may become a friend and then there will be always a barrier. This is cleverness, cunningness. This man, Machiavelli, was really very, very clever, cunning. Nobody has achieved that peak of\ncunningness ever. Every monarch in the West read his book and every monarch was impressed – he was right. Every monarch tried to follow him, but no monarch employed him in his service because such a dangerous man could be dangerous. He lived a poor man and he died a poor man. He tried many courts, but all doors were closed. His book was accepted everywhere, but he was not – such a clever man could be dangerous. They were applying his own ideology against him: if a man can be so clever he will create trouble. Once he comes close he can create trouble.\nMan is vicious because only man can be machiavellian. Other animals are simple, very simple, and when you think that they are doing something viciously, you are wrong. You think that mosquitoes are disturbing your meditation – they don’t know. They don’t know you at all, you are just food for them, and they are seeking their food, a simple thing.…\nWhen you go to a tree, to an apple tree or to any other fruit tree and you take the fruit from the tree have you ever thought that you are vicious to the tree? No, the idea never comes. The same is being done by the mosquito to you and mosquitoes are very impartial – even to a Buddha they will do the same.\nThey did. I was staying in Sarnath once, the place where Buddha gave his first sermon. Buddha moved around only a small part of India, the Bihar, so in forty years of wandering he passed through every village many times, but to Sarnath he never came again. He visited it only once, the first time, and he never came again.\nSo I asked the Buddhist BHIKKHU who was the head of the Sarnath temple, what the matter was. Why did Buddha never come again?. He brooded and he said: Maybe mosquitoesSarnath has\nthe biggest mosquitoes in India.\nMosquitoes are impartial. They don’t bother whether you are a Buddha or not; whether you are meditating or murdering someone they are in search of their food. And as you are in search of your food and you never feel that you are vicious, why should they be thought as vicious? Nobody is vicious. Even the germs that can kill you, they too are not vicious, they are in search of their food. Even the germs that create a cancer in your body that will certainly kill you, that no medicine can help – even they are not vicious, they are not machiavellian, they are not politicians. They are simple people, just in search of food and they are very happy that they have found a home within you. They are not doing any harm to you knowingly because they cannot do anything knowingly. They are enjoying life as you are enjoying life.\nOnce you understand thisI don’t mean that you just sit naked and become food for them, that is\nnot my meaning. You protect yourself, but don’t think them vicious. You protect yourself. If the tree could have protected herself she would have protected herself against you. You protect yourself. Even the mosquito protects itself, even the mosquitoes become immune to DDT. Everybody has to protect himself. I’m not saying that you should become a victim and, thinking that mosquitoes are not vicious, you should sit naked and allow them on you because they are in search of food. Then you are moving to the other extreme, to another foolishness.\nYou protect yourself, everybody protects. Even the mosquito will protect himself – but don’t think that they are vicious, because the idea that life around you is vicious is very dangerous. That idea will harm you more than all the animals and all the mosquitoes and all the ants combined, because\nthat idea will give you a feeling of separateness from life, that idea will give you an enmity towards life, that idea will never allow you to surrender to the whole.\nThe fifth question:\nQuestion 5\nWHAT IS MONEY AND WHY ARE MOST PEOPLE DEEPLY UNCOMFORTABLE ABOUT IT IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER?\nIt is a touchy question, because money is not what it appears. Money is more deep-rooted. Money is not just there outside in the currency notes, it is something to do with your inner mind and attitudes. Money is your love of things, money is your escape from persons, money is your security against death, money is your effort to control life, money is a thousand and one things. Money is not just in the currency notes otherwise things would have been very easy.\nMoney is your love – love of things, not of persons. The most comfortable love is of things because things are dead, you can possess them easily. You can possess a big house, a palace – the greatest palace you can possess easily – but you cannot possess even the smallest baby; even that baby rejects, even that baby fights for his freedom. A small baby, howsoever small, is dangerous for the man who wants to possess. It will rebel, it will become rebellious, but it will not allow anybody to possess it.\nPeople who cannot love persons start loving money because money is a means to possess things. The more money you have, the more things you can possess; and the more things you can possess, the more you can forget about persons. You will have many things but you will not have any contentment because deep contentment comes only when you love a person. The money will not revolt but it cannot respond also, that is the trouble. That’s why miserly people become very ugly. Nobody has responded to their love ever. How can you be beautiful without love falling on you, without love showering on you like flowers – how can you be beautiful? You become ugly. You become closed. A man who possesses money or tries to possess money, is miserly and he will always be afraid of persons and people because if they are allowed to come closer they may start sharing. If you allow somebody closeness you have to allow some sharing also. People who love things become like things – dead, closed. Nothing vibrates in them, nothing dances and sings in them, their hearts have lost the beat, they live a mechanical life. They drag, burdened, burdened with many things, but they don’t have any freedom because only love can give you freedom; and love can give you freedom only if you give freedom to love.\nPeople who are afraid of love become possessive about money. People who love become non- possessive, money doesn’t matter much. If it is, it is okay, it can be used; If it is not, that too is okay, because love is such a kingdom that no money can purchase it. Love is such a deep fulfillment that you can be a beggar on the street and you can sing if you have love in your heart. If you have loved and you have been loved, love crowns you, makes a king of you. Money simply makes you ugly.\nI am not against money. I am not saying: ‘Go and throw it away,’ because that is another extreme. That is also the last step of the miserly mind. A man who has suffered too much because of money, who has clung to money and could not love anybody or become open, becomes so frustrated in\nthe end that he throws away the money, renounces and goes to the Himalayas, enters a Tibetan monastery and becomes a lama. This man has not understood. If you understand, money can be used, but people who don’t understand are either misers, they can’t use the money, or they renounce the money, because in renouncing they are also saving the same mind. Now there will be no difficulty in using it: you renounce all and escape. But they cannot use the money, they are afraid of using it.\nThey can renounce, remember this. I have seen misers renouncing completely, totally. A man founded a university in Sagar in India, I was a student there. This man was a rare specimen, his name was Dr. Hari Singh Gaur. I have never come across a greater miser than him and I have not come across a greater renouncer either. He was perfect in both the ways. For his whole life he never gave a single paise to anybody, no beggar ever received anything from his bungalow.\nIf it was known in his town, Sagar, that some beggar was going to Hari Singh’s house to ask, others would laugh and they would say: Seems to be new to the town. Nobody ever received anything. He never donated a single rupee for any cause, humanitarian or anything. For the Indian National Freedom Movement he never donated a single paise – no, that was not his way. He was a perfect miser and he was one of the greatest lawyers in the world. He had three offices, one in India, one in China, one in England, and he worked four months in England, four months in India, four months in China. He was one of the best lawyers in the world. He accumulated so much money and then in the end he donated his whole life’s savings. The whole university of Sagar is created by a single person’s donation. It is one of the most beautiful universities.\nBut when he donated, he donated all. You will be surprised to know that he donated so absolutely that he did not leave a single paise for his children. Now they are fighting in the courts, they have nothing, they are beggars on the street. The miser remains a miser to the very end, even when he renounces. He couldn’t give to his children even a single paise but he could renounce the whole.\nFirst you can accumulate money like a madman, then one day you understand that you wasted your whole life. When you understand this you become afraid, but the old habit persists. You can give the whole and forget about it and escape, but you cannot share it.\nIf a man of understanding has money he shares it because money is not for itself, it is for life. If he feels that life needs it, love needs it, he can throw it away completely, but it is not a renunciation, it is again using it. Love is the goal for him; money is never the goal, money is the means. For people who are after money, money is the goal, love becomes just a means. Even their prayer is for money; even prayer becomes a means to money.\nMoney is a very complex phenomenon. Why do people get so much into it, and so many people at that? It has a certain appeal, a magnetic appeal. Money has a hypnotic appeal in it and the appeal is that you can possess it completely. Money is very docile, it becomes a slave. The ego feels very fulfilled.\nLove is not docile, love is rebellious. You cannot possess love. You can possess a woman, you can possess a man, but you can never possess love. If you possess a woman, the woman has become money, a thing; if you possess a man, the man has become money, a thing, an instrument. A man is a man and a woman is a woman only when they are an end unto themselves, not a means\nto anything else. Money is the means, and to become obsessed with the means is the greatest foolishness that can occur to a man and the greatest curse.\nMoney should not become the goal, but I am not saying at the same time that you should renounce it and become beggars – use it, it is a good means. I’m not against money, I have nothing to say against it. I am saying something about you and your possessiveness, not about money. Money can be beautiful – if it is not possessed, if you don’t become obsessed with it. It can be beautiful. Money is like blood circulating in the body: in the body of society money circulates, it is blood. It helps society to be enriched, to be alive – but it is like blood.\nYou must have heard about diseases in which the blood stops and cannot circulate, clots of blood come into existence and they become blocks and the blood cannot circulate in the body. Then you are paralyzed, and if the clots happen in the heart you are dead.\nIf money circulates, moves from one hand to another, goes on moving, the more movement the better, then the blood circulates well, then life is healthy. But when a miser comes in, a clot has happened; somewhere somebody is accumulating, not sharing, and that is a clot in the blood circulation. The man disturbs, he does not live himself and because of his blocking he does not allow others to live. The money has stopped circulating. Blood circulating is life, blood stopped, blocked, is death. Money circulating is life, money stopped, blocked, is death.\nI’m for a society where money moves fast, nobody clings to it, everybody uses it, and you remember that the simple law of money is: the more you use it, the more valuable it is. For example, we are sitting here. If ten persons have a hundred rupees in their pockets, and they keep it to themselves, then ten persons have only one thousand rupees, dead. But when those rupees circulate, if they make two rounds, ten thousand have become twenty thousand; if they make three rounds they have become thirty thousand; and if they make four roundsThe more they circulate, the more money\nthere is, because when one hundred rupees are kept by one man those hundred rupees are dead. If he uses them they go to somebody else, then they come to him again because others are also using them; now he has two hundred rupees, and again three hundred, four hundred, five hundred.The\nmore you use it, the more money floats and circulates, and the richer society is.\nAmerica is richest because America is the least miserly country in the world. Money circulates fast; everybody is using that money which he has, and even that money which he is going to have in the future, he is using it too. The country is bound to become rich. A country like India is bound to remain poor because people cling. If you cling to money the country will remain poor. When nobody uses it, money becomes like clots in blood.\nIndia has two types of people: misers and renouncers. Both these types are wrong, ill, abnormal, neurotic. One should have money, earn money, produce money – and use it. One should hold it only to use and one should use it only to hold; it becomes a circle. Then a person is both, a miser and a renouncer together. When you are miser and renouncer together you are neither miser nor renouncer, you simply enjoy whatsoever money can give. Money can give many things and money cannot give many things; when you use it then you know what money can give. Money can give all that is outward – things of this world, nothing is wrong in them. Nothing is wrong in having a beautiful house. Nothing is wrong in having a beautiful garden – money can give it to you. But money cannot give you love, that is expecting too much from poor money.\nOne should expect only that which can be expected, one should not move in the impossibilities..Just asking poor money to give you love – poor money cannot do it. But nothing is wrong, don’t get angry with the money! Don’t burn it and throw it in the river and go to the Himalayas. In the first place you asked something which a man of understanding would never have asked – you are foolish, that’s all. Nothing is wrong with the money.\nA wandering monk came to see me two or three years ago and he was very much against money. He would not even touch it – this is a neurosis. There are people who only count money the whole day, and in the night also, in their minds, they go on counting. They touch only money with a loving hand, they never touch anybody else with a loving hand. When they look at their currency notes, watch their eyes – they sparkle. They are hypnotized. These are neurotic people. Then there are other neurotics... This wandering monk came to me, he would not touch money. So I said: Then it must be very difficult for you. How did you come to Bombay to see me? He said: There is nothing difficult. He showed two other men, his disciples: they could touch, they were not such evolved beings. What foolishness! They could purchase the ticket and they could keep the money, but for him, he said: I don’t touch, I have gone far beyond it.\nI said: But what is the point? Now you are not only using money, you are using two other persons as your pockets. You have reduced two persons, alive persons, to pockets; you have murdered. What was wrong in keeping it in your own pocket?\nAnd the man said: So it seems you are in favour of money? What can money give? Can money give love? Can money give God? I said: You are foolish if you ask love and God from poor money, your expectations are false. Money never promised them to you, but whatsoever money promises it can give. It never promises that it can give you love. If you expect it you are idiotic.\nThese people who have been expecting too much from money one day become enemies of money. Then they escape, then they don’t touch money. Even Vinoba closes his eyes if you bring money to him, he will not see it. What nonsense! What is wrong in money? Something still seems to be miserly inside, something still seems to be like a wound, otherwise why close your eyes? What is wrong in a currency note? It is just paper, and these spiritual people go on saying that it is just paper. If you put ordinary paper in their hands, they touch it, but when you put a currency note there they throw it away as if it is a scorpion or very deadly disease.\nNeurosis can move from one extreme to another. Use money. Money is beautiful as far as it goes, and it goes far enough! As far as the world is concerned it goes far enough, but don’t expect love, because it is of the interior, of the inner being, and don’t ask for God, because it is transcendental.\nUse everything for its own capacities, not for your dreams. Then you are a healthy man, and to be healthy is to be holy. Don’t be abnormal in any way. Be normal, ordinary, and just create more understanding so that you can see. Money can be used, should be used, it can give you a beautiful world.\nOtherwise, sooner or later, if you are against money you will create a dirty country like India: everything is dirty – but they think they are great spiritualists. Everything has gone ugly but they think they are great spiritualists because they have renounced. That’s why things have got so bad. They think one has to close one’s eyes and not look outside.\nIt is good to look outside because outside is God’s creation; it is good to look inside because inside is sitting the Creator. Both are good. Eyes are meant to blink; they are not meant to remain open forever and they are not meant to be closed forever. They are meant to blink – open and close, open and close. That is the rhythm – out and in, out and in.\nLook outside – the beautiful creation; look inside – the beautiful God. And by and by you will see that the in and out meet and mingle and are one.\nThe sixth question:\nQuestion 6\nWHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PASSIVITY, AND LAZINESS, A YIN POSITION AND INERTIA? SOMETIMES I FEEL THAT WITHOUT FORCE OF WILL I WOULD NEVER GET OUT OF BED.\nThere is vast difference between laziness and passivity. Passivity is alert, laziness is dull; passivity is energy, laziness is nothing but no energy, a state of no energy. Never get confused between passivity and laziness: laziness is an ill state of affairs, passivity is just a wonderful health.\nPassivity is so healthy that it has no need for activity, because the need to be active may be again an obsession. You cannot remain still, you feel afraid of being still, you cannot remain with yourself, you feel afraid of being yourself – so you move into activity. Activity is an escape. A constant need for occupation is not a good state of affairs; one should be able to just be passive and enjoy. Enjoy what? Enjoy the breeze passing, enjoy the clouds moving, enjoy the trees so happy and so green, enjoy the birds singing. Or just enjoy breathing in and out, it too is very beautiful: just to be capable of breathing silently, of being alive, is a tremendous phenomenon. It is a miracle to feel oneself: I am here and now. This moment I am alive! I can look, I can listen, I can touch, I can taste – life is happening to me this very moment, the river of life is flowing through me. Just to feel it.…\nPassivity is alert energy. When I say ‘alert energy’ I mean: passivity can any moment become activity. Energy is there, you can transform it into activity any moment, not even a single moment’s notice has to be given. Out of passivity you can just get up and run for miles – in fact more than a man who has been active. He may not be able to run for miles because activity dissipates energy. A man who is passive is full of energy, a reservoir, and he is alert. If you watch a passive man... forget man because it will be difficult to find a man and to watch him: watch a cat, sitting silently, but how alert! Even if her eyes are closed and even if you see that she is dreaming and nodding the head – a beautiful dream eating a mouse, you can see the lips moving and the enjoyment that comes to a cat when she eats the mouse – if there is just a slight noise everything is alert, the cat is as aware as a buddha. Suddenly, with not a single moment’s loss, if somebody enters the room the cat is alert.\nLook at a cat watching near a mouse hole, waiting for the mouse to come out. How silently, how still she waits. You cannot find such a perfect yogi because no yogi is so confident about God coming out of his hole. The cat is perfectly confident, certain, absolutely certain. She trusts the mouse, he will be coming. And he comes... then look at the jump, the energy, the radiant energy, the alertness! In a single jump the mouse is caught.\nAnd a cat never misses.\nWatch passivity, you will always find it glistening with a reservoir of life, energy, radiance, any moment ready to jump into activity. The energy is ready. It is not lethargy, it is not inertia, it is not low energy. It is energy waiting, it can be transformed any moment. Lethargy, laziness, is a state of no energy, you are as if you are almost dead. Then you have to pull yourself out of bed, then you have to pull yourself out of everything, the whole day: somehow you pull yourself out of bed, somehow you pull yourself up to prepare tea, somehow you drink the tea. Somehow you stop breakfast, otherwise you will go on eating because a lazy man has even no energy to stop anything. He can sleep or he can eat but then he goes on because who will stop? For stopping, will will be needed.\nSo you drag on, from the morning to the evening and then you have to drag yourself to bed again because a lazy man cannot just go to bed. One who has not just come out of bed will never be capable of just going to bed. No, even that will mean dragging himself. He drags from the club and the hotel; he somehow drags himself from the TV – otherwise he is glued to the chair, he cannot get up – somehow puts the TV or radio off, goes to bed, and somehow drags himself to make love. It is a dragging, it is a no-energy state, it is not passivity. Don’t think that this is passivity; this is a disease.\nWhat to do? First go to the doctor and let your body be checked because whenever you have some problem always start from the body: you may be lacking some vitamins in your food, you may be lacking some hormones in your blood. The first thing is the body, so first take care of the body. Out of a hundred cases, ninety cases will be immediately helped by the doctor. For them there is no need to come to me.\nFor the other ten cases, if the doctors can’t help you, then come to me because you must then be concerned with the mind. You are afraid to live. For these ten per cent I say that it is not really low energy – you are afraid to get out of bed, you are afraid because life is there. Again you will have to move in life, meet people, love people, be friendly, be intimate – anything is possible, anything can happen. You are afraid of the unknown, you want to remain in the coziness of your bed. It seems to be protected.\nThere are many people who remain ill just because they are afraid of life; they are not actually ill, they are pretending. If the doctors cannot help you then come to me. You may be afraid of life.\nIt happens almost always. For example, a man is losing business, and suddenly he has a heart attack. People think it is because he was losing business. It does have some concern with the losing of the business but that is not the cause. Now there seems to be no way to be again in the market, so to save face he is creating his illness. The heart attack is not created by the business situation, the heart attack is a psychological defense. Now he can lie in the bed and at least rationalize that what can he do? He is so ill with the heart attack, life is in danger, so the business is going. He is going bankrupt because he is ill.\nNow Lying in bed he can rationalize that it is not his fault, what can he do? What can he do against fate? Now his wife also cannot say: Go to the market, go to the shop. Nobody can. Now he has a perfect alibi to remain in bed.\nHe’s afraid to go to the market; you are afraid to go into life. You cannot encounter life situations, so it is better to live in bed. This is suicidal. If mind is the case then something can be done; if the\nbody is the case then don’t be worried, it can be done by a doctor – you need not do many great SADHANAS for it.\nFirst let the body be checked. Then, if mind is the case, we can solve it. Then we can bring up all the unconscious fears, we can help them to surface. Once they surface, once they come up into consciousness, they disappear, and you gather courage. Then there is no need to use will to get up out of bed. Will is not a good thing. One should get up out of energy, not because of the will’s effort. One should get up because one slept so beautifully the whole night that now one is full of energy. The very energy brings you out of bed, not any effort of will. Then the whole day you work and live and experience a thousand and one things, and then you are tired, the day is finished. That very state brings you to bed again, to relax; you need not drag. Life should not be a dragging, it should be a spontaneous flowing..\nBut first try to solve the bodily problems. If nothing can be done through the body, then something can always be done through the mind.\nThe last question:\nQuestion 7\nIS JESUS’ ‘OFFER THE OTHER CHEEK’ ATTITUDE APPLICABLE FOR US TODAY HERE IN POONA, OR SHOULD WE MEET THE FORCE OFFERED TO US WITH FORCE – OR SHOULD WE RESPOND AS WE FEEL BEFITS THE SITUATION?\nNo, I don’t give you any dogma, I don’t give you any formula to live up to, because all formulas are false, all formulas are dead, all formulas create a structure around you and that structure becomes by and by your imprisonment. I don’t give you any formula, not even the Jesus formula.\nI want you to be understanding, alert, aware. Let that be your only source of action.\nSometimes maybe it is good to offer the other cheek, but only sometimes. It is relative. Sometimes it is better to hit hard, but that too sometimes, and one can never predict. You have to watch the whole situation of a certain moment and live with total response.\nIf you carry a formula you will not be free.\nI have heard an anecdote. A Christian saint who used to follow Jesus’ sayings word for word, literally, was hit hard by an enemy on one cheek. Of course he showed him the other cheek because that’s how Jesus said it had to be done. The man hit him again hard on the other cheek.\nThe so-called saint was waiting for this to bring about a conversion in the man. All Christians think that when you offer the other cheek, the other man will be so enlightened by your compassion, love, brotherly feeling, he will be so encompassed by your beautiful gesture of offering the other cheek that he will simply fall at your feet and become a disciple. But that doesn’t happen in life, life is not so easy.\nThe man, seeing that this saint was offering the other cheek, hit him hard, harder than at first. Now the saint was a little in doubt about what to do because Jesus doesn’t say: Then again offer the\nother cheek. Now the formula comes to an end, so he was a little in doubt. He tried to decide what to do, then jumped on the enemy. The enemy was surprised. He said: What are you doing? A Christian saint? First you followed the rule which I was waiting for and you proved that you are a Christian saint, but what are you doing now? The Christian saint said: But the formula ends there. Up to now there was Jesus, now I’m here.\nEven in the time when Jesus was alive somebody asked him about this. When he said that when somebody hits on your right cheek, you should give him the left, somebody asked: How many times should it be done? Will seven times do? Jesus said: Seven times? No, not even seventy-seven times. I would say to you: Seven hundred and seventy-seven times.\nBut then too the end will come. Seven hundred and seventy-seven times? Then what about the seven hundred and seventy-eighth time? All formulas come to an end – howsoever long a rope you give to them, they come to an end. Seven or seventy-seven doesn’t make much difference.\nFormulas are dead, they have limitations. Life is infinite, it has no limitations.\nJust watch the situation and don’t have any formula in your head; otherwise you will not be able to watch the situation as it is, the formula will overcolour the whole thing. You simply put all Jesuses, all Buddhas, all Rajneeshes aside and just look at the situation. Don’t be Rajneesh for even two times, from the very beginning be yourself. The Christian saint had to be himself the third time, when the situation was again the same. Why wait for that? You be yourself from the very beginning.\nThen you will never repent. Act out of the total situation, then there is no repentance. Whatsoever you could do you did. Then you can move with no scars.\nLet your life be a life of total understanding, that’s all I would like to say to you. Don’t ask for specific formulas, I have none. I have only a general attitude – the light of understanding, the fragrance of understanding. And whatsoever happens in it is good, is virtuous.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"9470","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/tao_the_three_treasures_vol_2/part6/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/tao_the_three_treasures_vol_2/>Tao.

FIRST. IS THAT NOT A THING OF THE EGO, AND WILL IT NOT BECOME MORE
STRENGTHENED? I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN HARD ON MYSELF AND MISSED MUCH OF THE
JOYS OF LIFE. PLEASE EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DISCIPLINE AND
CONTROL.</p><p><br></p><p>There is not only a difference, there is a vast difference:
discipline and control are polar opposites.</p><p><br></p><p>Control is from the ego, discipline is from the non-ego; control is
manipulating yourself, discipline is to understand yourself; discipline
is a natural phenomenon, control is unnatural; discipline is
spontaneous, control is a sort of suppression. Discipline needs only
understanding – you understand and you act according to your
understanding. Discipline has no ideal to follow, discipline has no
dogma to follow, discipline is not perfectionistic – discipline leads
you by and by towards a wholeness.</p><p>Control is perfectionistic, it has an ideal to be achieved; you have
an idea in the mind about how you should be. Control has many shoulds
and many should-nots, discipline has none. Discipline is a natural
understanding, a flowering.</p><p><br></p><p>The very word ‘discipline’ comes from a root which means ‘to learn’;
it comes from the same root as the word ‘disciple’. A disciple is one
who is ready to learn – and discipline is that capacity of openness
which helps you to learn.</p><p>Discipline has nothing to do with control. In fact, a disciplined
mind is never a mind which thinks in terms of control, there is no need
for it. A disciplined mind needs no control, a disciplined mind is
absolutely free.</p><p><br></p><p>An undisciplined mind needs control because an undisciplined mind
feels that without control there is danger. An undisciplined mind cannot
trust itself, hence the control. For example: If you don’t control
yourself you may kill somebody – in anger, in rage you can be a
murderer. You need control, because you are afraid of yourselves.</p><p><br></p><p>A man of understanding, a man who understands himself and others,
always feels compassion. Even if somebody is an enemy, a man of
understanding has compassion towards him because a man of understanding
can understand the viewpoint of the other also. He knows why the other
feels as he feels, he knows why the other is angry, because he knows his
own self, and in knowing that, he has known all others. He has
compassion, he understands, and he follows understanding. When I say
this don’t misunderstand me – understanding in fact need not be
followed. The very word ‘following’ gives the idea of having to do
something: you understand, then you have to do something – follow. No –
understand, and everything settles by itself. You need not follow. It
starts happening.</p><p><br></p><p>So the first thing to understand is the difference between control
and discipline. Control is a false coin, invented by society as a
substitute for discipline. It looks exactly like discipline: every false
coin looks that way, otherwise you could not make it current, it could
not circulate in the market. There are many false coins about inner
life. For example, control is a false coin for the real coin of
discipline, and for the real coin of understanding, knowledge is a false
coin.</p><p><br></p><p>For religion, sect is a false coin. To fulfil your need of being
religious many false sects are offered to you – Christianity, Hinduism,
Jainism. All ‘-isms’ are false. Religion has no ‘-ism’ about it, it is
not a dogma. It is something that flowers within you, not something
which is enforced from without. Always be aware of the false coins
because they are in circulation, and they have been in circulation for
so long that people have almost forgotten about the real coins. Religion
is neither Christian, nor Hindu, nor Mohammedan; religion is simply
religion. It is an attitude which one has to grow into, one cannot be
born into it.</p><p><br></p><p>Nobody can be religious by birth; it comes through creative effort,
it comes through suffering and experience, it comes through wandering
and coming home, it comes through going astray and coming back to the
right path. Through much suffering and experience, by and by a certain
quality of being starts crystallizing within you: that crystalized being
is religious and the fragrance that surrounds that crystalized being is
religion. It is indefinable.</p><p><br></p><p>The same is true about control and discipline. Beware of control.
Never try to control yourself. Who will control really? If you
understand, there is no need to control; if you don’t understand, then
who will control? This is the crux of the whole problem.</p><p><br></p><p>If you understand, what is the need to control? You understand, so
you do whatsoever is right. Not that you have to do it, you simply do it
because how can you do the wrong? If you are hungry, you don’t start
eating stones – you understand that stones cannot be eaten, finished!
There is no need to give you a commandment: ‘Never eat stones when you
are hungry.’ It will be foolish, simply foolish to say it. When you are
thirsty you drink water. What is the need to make any should or
should-not about it?</p><p>Life is simple when you understand. There are no regulations or rules
around it, there is no need, because your very understanding is the rule
of all rules. There is only one golden rule and that is understanding;
all other rules are useless, they can be thrown away. If you understand,
you can drop all controls, you can be free because whatsoever you do,
you will do through understanding.</p><p><br></p><p>If you ask me the definition of what is right, I will say: That which
is done through understanding. Right and wrong have no objective values;
there is nothing like a right action and a wrong action, there are only
actions done through understanding and actions done through
non-understanding. So sometimes it is possible that one action may be
wrong this moment and right the next moment because the situation has
changed and now the understanding says something else. Understanding is
to live moment to moment, with a sensitive response to life.</p><p><br></p><p>You don’t have a fixed dogma of how to act; you look around, you
feel, you see, and then you act out of that feeling, seeing, knowing –
the action comes.</p><p><br></p><p>A man of control has no vision of life, he has no sensitivity to
life. When the road is right in front of him, open, he consults a map;
when the door is just in front of him he asks others: Where is the door?
He is blind. Then he has to control himself because the door is changing
every moment. Life is not a dead, static thing – it is not. It is
dynamic.</p><p><br></p><p>So the same rule that was good for yesterday will not be good for
today and cannot be good for tomorrow. But a man who lives through
control has a fixed ideology, he follows his map. Roads go on being
changed every day, life goes on moving into new dimensions, but he goes
on carrying his old rubbishy ideology. He looks at his idea, then he
follows it, and then he is always in the wrong situation.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why you feel that you have missed many joys in life. You have
to miss, because the only joy that life can give is a response of
understanding. Then you feel many joys, but then you don’t have any
rules, any ideas, any ideals, then you are not here to follow certain
codes – you are here to live and discover your own code of life.</p><p><br></p><p>When you become aware of your own code of life, you will see that it
is not a fixed thing. It is as dynamic as life itself.</p><p><br></p><p>If you try to control, it is the ego; it is the ego manipulating you
in many ways. Through the ego, society manipulates you, and through
society, the dead, all those who are dead now, manipulate you. Every
living being, if he follows a dead ideology, is following dead
people.</p><p><br></p><p>Zarathustra is beautiful, Buddha is beautiful, Lao Tzu is beautiful,
Jesus is beautiful – but they are no longer applicable. They lived their
lives, they flowered beautifully: learn through them – but don’t be a
stupid follower. Be a disciple, but don’t be a student.</p><p><br></p><p>A student learns the word, the dead word; a disciple just learns the
secrets of understanding, and when he has his own understanding, he goes
on his own way. He pays his respect to Lao Tzu and says: Now I’m ready,
I’m grateful, I go my own way. He will always be grateful to Lao Tzu –
and this is the paradox: people who have been deadly following Jesus,
Buddha or Mohammed can never forgive them. If you miss your joys of life
because of them how can you forgive them? How can you</p><p>really be in gratitude? In fact you are deeply in anger. If you come
across them you will kill them, you will murder them because these are
the people who have forced you into a controlled life; these are the
people who didn’t allow you to live as you would have liked to live;
these are the people, Moses and Mohammed, who have given you
commandments about how to live. You cannot forgive them. Your gratitude
is false. You are so miserable, how can you be grateful? For what? For
your misery can you be grateful? No, you can be grateful only when you
are blissful.</p><p><br></p><p>Gratitude follows like a shadow when you have an inner blessing, a
feeling of constant benediction.</p><p><br></p><p>Be a man of discipline but never be a man of control. Then how can
you be disciplined? You know only one meaning of discipline and that is
being controlled – by yourself or by others. Drop all rules and
regulations and live life with a deeper alertness, that’s all.
Understanding should be the only law. If you understand you will love,
if you love you will not commit any harm to anybody; if you understand
you will be happy, if you are happy you will share; if you understand
you will become so blissful that from your whole being, continuously as
a continuum, like a river, will arise a thankfulness towards existence.
That is the prayer.</p><p><br></p><p>Try to understand life, don’t force, and remain always free from the
past; because if the past is there and you are controlling, you cannot
understand life. And life is so fleeting, it doesn’t wait.</p><p><br></p><p>But why do people try to make rules? Why do they fall into the trap
at all? They fall into the trap because a life of understanding is a
life of danger. You have to rely upon yourself. The life of control is
comfortable and secure, you need not rely on yourself: Moses will do,
the Bible will do, the Koran will do, the Gita will do – you need not
bother about the problems, you can escape from them. You take shelter in
old words, disciplines, thoughts, you cling to them. This is how you
make a comfortable life, a life of convenience – but a life of
convenience is not a life of bliss. Then you miss joys because joys are
possible only when you live dangerously. There is no other way to
live.</p><p><br></p><p>Live dangerously, and when I say ‘live dangerously’ I mean live
according to your own self, whatsoever the cost. Whatsoever is at stake,
live according to your own consciousness, according to your own heart
and feeling.</p><p><br></p><p>If all security is lost, all comfort and convenience is lost then too
you will be happy. You may be a beggar, you may not be a king, you may
be on the streets in rags, but no emperor can compete with you. Even
emperors will feel jealous of you because you will have a richness, a
richness not of things, a richness of consciousness. You will have a
subtle light around you and you will have a feeling of blissfulness.
Even others can touch that feeling: it is so visible, so substantial,
others will be affected by it, it will become a magnet.</p><p><br></p><p>You may outwardly be a beggar but inwardly you have become a
king.</p><p><br></p><p>But if you live a life of convenience and security and comfort you
will avoid danger, you will avoid many difficulties and sufferings; but
by avoiding those difficulties and sufferings you will avoid all the
bliss that is possible in life. When you avoid suffering you avoid
bliss, remember that. When you try to escape a problem you are escaping
the solution also. When you don’t want to face a situation you are
crippling your own life. Never live a controlled life – that is the life
of an escapist – but be disciplined. Disciplined not according to me,
not according to anybody, but according to your own</p><p>light. ‘Be a light unto yourself.’ That was Buddha’s last saying
before he died; the last thing that he uttered was, ‘Be a light unto
yourself.’ That is discipline.</p><p><br></p><p>The second question:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2</p><p><br></p><p>BUDDHA USED TO SEND SOMEONE AFRAID OF DEATH TO MEDITATE IN THE
CEMETERY, TO MAKE HIM READY FOR REAL MEDITATION. I FEEL MY FEAR OF DEATH
AS A BARRIER TO MY MEDITATION. WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO SEND ME?</p><p><br></p><p>There is no need, you have come to the cemetery. This English word
‘cemetery’, is very beautiful, it comes from the Sanskrit word, SAMADHI.
In India SAMADHI means both: the cemetery, the tomb, where a man is
buried and also the final realization, the ultimate realization – both,
because both are a sort of death.</p><p><br></p><p>When you die, it is an ordinary death of the body, but the cluster of
the mind survives, goes on taking new births, reincarnates, moves into
the wheel of life and death. Ordinary death is not a total death, it is
a partial death, a part of you dies; but the remaining part is so
powerful that it recreates the dead part, a new body is built again. A
new body crystalizes again.</p><p><br></p><p>Then there is the final death. The final death is only that of a
Buddha, of one who has known, who has come to know the secret of life,
has realized all that life can give – now there is nothing more for him
to come back to, he has passed the examination, he returns no more. He
dies not only as body, he dies as mind, as ego. He dies completely.
There remains only the inner space which becomes one with the outer
space; the walls between the inner and the outer disappear.</p><p><br></p><p>We call that SAMADHI and the English word ‘cemetery’ originated from
SAMADHI. No, I am not going to send you anywhere. I am your SAMADHI,
your cemetery, here. You can die in me.…</p><p><br></p><p>An ordinary cemetery won’t do, you can get accustomed to it. There
are people who work in the cemetery, who live there, but they have not
become enlightened. They have become accustomed, habitual, the whole
scene has become routine. Every day people come, dead bodies are
carried, they help to bury them or burn them, and that is that. Then
they take their food and they go to sleep – they live an ordinary
life.</p><p><br></p><p>If I send you to a cemetery you may be shocked, just in the
beginning, you may become afraid because the experience is new. But by
and by you will settle into it, it is not going to change you much. So I
have called you to me. If you look into me you will find your final
cemetery. So now there is no need to send you anywhere else.</p><p><br></p><p>The third question:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 3</p><p><br></p><p>IN ALL MY YEARS OF CATHARSIS IN THERAPY AND IN MEDITATION, I NEVER
‘LOSE CONTROL’. I ALWAYS HAVE A SENSE OF BEING INTO THE FEELING AND ALSO
OF WATCHING</p><p>IT. IS THIS BEING ‘SPLIT’ AND NOT-WHOLE? PLEASE EXPLAIN WHAT IS
HAPPENING. I HAVE THIS IDEA THAT ONE SHOULD TOTALLY LOSE ONESELF,
LET-GO, LOSE CONTROL.…</p><p><br></p><p>There are two ways to come out of the situation: to lose control
completely or to have control completely. There are two paths. One is of
deep involvement, so deep that nothing is left behind. For example,
Sufis in their Dervish dances involve themselves completely; they are
lost, merged.</p><p><br></p><p>Then there is another dimension which is of awareness. Zen people
remain alert and aware: carrying water from the well, cutting wood in
the forest, eating, sitting, walking, going to sleep, preparing their
beds – whatsoever they are doing, they remain completely alert.</p><p><br></p><p>These are the two ways. Either become completely aware so that
whatsoever is happening just becomes objective, you are totally cut off
from it, you become a witness. Or, get involved completely so that there
is no witness at all, you have become whatsoever is happening – if you
are dancing you have become the dance, there is no witness to it. Both
lead to the same, because deep down the real thing is not whether you
get lost or you remain alert. The real thing is to be total – totally
lost or totally aware. In both the cases you fulfil the condition of
being total.</p><p><br></p><p>So don’t think that they are opposites.</p><p><br></p><p>And there are two types of people: those who can easily get lost –
people of the feeling type, and the other type of people – people of the
intellectual type. So one has to remember his own type and find it. If
it is difficult for you to lose yourself totally then forget about
losing, don’t fight with it. Drop the idea. Maybe you are the
intellectual type, then there is a path for you: become aware. Forget
the whole idea of losing, dissolving, that is not for you, you be aware.
And don’t feel that you are missing something, you will reach the same
point from a different route. The same peak will be reached but your
path will be different.</p><p><br></p><p>There are only two types of people, so there are only two types of
paths.</p><p><br></p><p>One is the path of devotion, what in India is called BHAKTI yoga, the
path of love and devotion – a Meera, a Chaitanya, dancing and singing,
losing themselves completely in the act. When Meera is dancing there is
only dance, there is no Meera; the dancer is completely merged into the
dance. When Chaitanya is singing and dancing there is no Chaitanya; he
has become one with the act.</p><p><br></p><p>Then there is Buddha, Mahavir: they are aware, alert in whatsoever
they are doing. They are so alert that the doing is just something
outside, it never touches them. They remain untouched. They pass through
the water but the water never touches them; they remain uninvolved,
uncommitted, unidentified.</p><p><br></p><p>To me, both are true because I am not a sectarian. If you go to
Buddhists they will say: Don’t follow that path of devotion, you will be
lost. If you go to the followers of Chaitanya they will say: Don’t
listen to this Buddha, because unless you lose yourself how can you
attain? You will become egoistic.</p><p><br></p><p>But I tell you that both the paths lead. The real question is not
what path to choose, the real question is what type you are. Just feel
your type. And if in years of catharsis in therapy and meditation you
have never been able to lose control, then now at least lose the idea of
losing control. Try being alert.</p><p>The fourth question:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 4</p><p><br></p><p>YOU SAID THAT ONLY MAN IS VIOLENT AND KILLS FOR SPORT AND THAT
ANIMALS KILL FOR FOOD. YET I HAVE WITNESSED DOGS TEARING APART A FOX FOR
SPORT; A FOX KILLING NINE CHICKENS AND EATING ONLY ONE – NOT TO MENTION
THE RED ANTS VICIOUSLY ATTACKING US DURING MEDITATION. DOES THIS NOT PUT
ANIMALS IN THE SAME CATEGORY AS MAN?</p><p><br></p><p>You must have come across some very highly evolved animals who are
going to be born as human beings in their next incarnation. They are
almost human.</p><p><br></p><p>Dogs are being corrupted by man. Animals which live with man are
almost corrupted, they have become human: dogs, cats, and other animals.
If you have come across so many situations where you feel that the
violence was done for sport, then they are already human beings. Soon
you will meet them somewhere in their human form.</p><p><br></p><p>But I tell you that only man is violent. You may not understand other
animals: they may have killed more than they could eat – that only shows
they are not doing right arithmetic, that’s all. They might have killed
more than they could eat; that simply shows they don’t know how to
calculate beforehand. But it is not a sport. They are not doing it just
for their enjoyment, no.</p><p><br></p><p>And the ants walking on your body when you are meditating are not
vicious, they don’t know at all that you are meditating, they don’t know
at all that you are. They may be on their own business – ants are very
business-like – they may be on their own trip, you are just in their
way, that’s all. In fact, you are disturbing them, not they you. You are
just sitting there like a rock – you think you are meditating – and you
are disturbing their whole route. Ants are great followers of their
leaders – the leader has gone one way, so all the ants are going that
way. They are always very controlled, they are like the army. So they
have to pass you.</p><p><br></p><p>You think that they are in the way, you think that they are
disturbing you; they think that you are just in their way, disturbing
them. No, they are not vicious. Nobody is vicious except man, nobody can
be, because to be vicious much thinking capacity is needed. To be
vicious, one has to think about the future, one has to calculate about
the future. To be vicious, one has to think very, very much about the
past – past experiences, possibilities, impossibilities – and the
future. One has to be cunning, clever. To be vicious, one has to be a
disciple of Machiavelli or Chankya. Machiavelli says in his ‘Prince’
that before somebody attacks you, you should attack him, because that is
the only defense. Even if the other has not attacked you yet, you have
to suspect, and before he attacks, you attack first, because that is the
only great defense. If you attack first there is more possibility of
winning; if he attacks first there is less possibility of winning.</p><p><br></p><p>Machiavelli says: Don’t trust anybody, not even a friend, because who
knows, the friend may become an enemy the next day. So don’t say things
to a friend which you would not like to say to the enemy; and don’t say
things about the enemy, bad things about the enemy, because who knows,
the next day he may become a friend and then there will be always a
barrier. This is cleverness, cunningness. This man, Machiavelli, was
really very, very clever, cunning. Nobody has achieved that peak of</p><p>cunningness ever. Every monarch in the West read his book and every
monarch was impressed – he was right. Every monarch tried to follow him,
but no monarch employed him in his service because such a dangerous man
could be dangerous. He lived a poor man and he died a poor man. He tried
many courts, but all doors were closed. His book was accepted
everywhere, but he was not – such a clever man could be dangerous. They
were applying his own ideology against him: if a man can be so clever he
will create trouble. Once he comes close he can create trouble.</p><p><br></p><p>Man is vicious because only man can be machiavellian. Other animals
are simple, very simple, and when you think that they are doing
something viciously, you are wrong. You think that mosquitoes are
disturbing your meditation – they don’t know. They don’t know you at
all, you are just food for them, and they are seeking their food, a
simple thing.…</p><p><br></p><p>When you go to a tree, to an apple tree or to any other fruit tree
and you take the fruit from the tree have you ever thought that you are
vicious to the tree? No, the idea never comes. The same is being done by
the mosquito to you and mosquitoes are very impartial – even to a Buddha
they will do the same.</p><p><br></p><p>They did. I was staying in Sarnath once, the place where Buddha gave
his first sermon. Buddha moved around only a small part of India, the
Bihar, so in forty years of wandering he passed through every village
many times, but to Sarnath he never came again. He visited it only once,
the first time, and he never came again.</p><p><br></p><p>So I asked the Buddhist BHIKKHU who was the head of the Sarnath
temple, what the matter was. Why did Buddha never come again?. He
brooded and he said: Maybe mosquitoes<span class=s4></span>Sarnath
has</p><p>the biggest mosquitoes in India.</p><p><br></p><p>Mosquitoes are impartial. They don’t bother whether you are a Buddha
or not; whether you are meditating or murdering someone they are in
search of their food. And as you are in search of your food and you
never feel that you are vicious, why should they be thought as vicious?
Nobody is vicious. Even the germs that can kill you, they too are not
vicious, they are in search of their food. Even the germs that create a
cancer in your body that will certainly kill you, that no medicine can
help – even they are not vicious, they are not machiavellian, they are
not politicians. They are simple people, just in search of food and they
are very happy that they have found a home within you. They are not
doing any harm to you knowingly because they cannot do anything
knowingly. They are enjoying life as you are enjoying life.</p><p><br></p><p>Once you understand this<span class=s4></span>I don’t mean that you
just sit naked and become food for them, that is</p><p>not my meaning. You protect yourself, but don’t think them vicious.
You protect yourself. If the tree could have protected herself she would
have protected herself against you. You protect yourself. Even the
mosquito protects itself, even the mosquitoes become immune to DDT.
Everybody has to protect himself. I’m not saying that you should become
a victim and, thinking that mosquitoes are not vicious, you should sit
naked and allow them on you because they are in search of food. Then you
are moving to the other extreme, to another foolishness.</p><p><br></p><p>You protect yourself, everybody protects. Even the mosquito will
protect himself – but don’t think that they are vicious, because the
idea that life around you is vicious is very dangerous. That idea will
harm you more than all the animals and all the mosquitoes and all the
ants combined, because</p><p>that idea will give you a feeling of separateness from life, that
idea will give you an enmity towards life, that idea will never allow
you to surrender to the whole.</p><p><br></p><p>The fifth question:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 5</p><p><br></p><p>WHAT IS MONEY AND WHY ARE MOST PEOPLE DEEPLY UNCOMFORTABLE ABOUT IT
IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER?</p><p><br></p><p>It is a touchy question, because money is not what it appears. Money
is more deep-rooted. Money is not just there outside in the currency
notes, it is something to do with your inner mind and attitudes. Money
is your love of things, money is your escape from persons, money is your
security against death, money is your effort to control life, money is a
thousand and one things. Money is not just in the currency notes
otherwise things would have been very easy.</p><p><br></p><p>Money is your love – love of things, not of persons. The most
comfortable love is of things because things are dead, you can possess
them easily. You can possess a big house, a palace – the greatest palace
you can possess easily – but you cannot possess even the smallest baby;
even that baby rejects, even that baby fights for his freedom. A small
baby, howsoever small, is dangerous for the man who wants to possess. It
will rebel, it will become rebellious, but it will not allow anybody to
possess it.</p><p><br></p><p>People who cannot love persons start loving money because money is a
means to possess things. The more money you have, the more things you
can possess; and the more things you can possess, the more you can
forget about persons. You will have many things but you will not have
any contentment because deep contentment comes only when you love a
person. The money will not revolt but it cannot respond also, that is
the trouble. That’s why miserly people become very ugly. Nobody has
responded to their love ever. How can you be beautiful without love
falling on you, without love showering on you like flowers – how can you
be beautiful? You become ugly. You become closed. A man who possesses
money or tries to possess money, is miserly and he will always be afraid
of persons and people because if they are allowed to come closer they
may start sharing. If you allow somebody closeness you have to allow
some sharing also. People who love things become like things – dead,
closed. Nothing vibrates in them, nothing dances and sings in them,
their hearts have lost the beat, they live a mechanical life. They drag,
burdened, burdened with many things, but they don’t have any freedom
because only love can give you freedom; and love can give you freedom
only if you give freedom to love.</p><p><br></p><p>People who are afraid of love become possessive about money. People
who love become non- possessive, money doesn’t matter much. If it is, it
is okay, it can be used; If it is not, that too is okay, because love is
such a kingdom that no money can purchase it. Love is such a deep
fulfillment that you can be a beggar on the street and you can sing if
you have love in your heart. If you have loved and you have been loved,
love crowns you, makes a king of you. Money simply makes you ugly.</p><p><br></p><p>I am not against money. I am not saying: ‘Go and throw it away,’
because that is another extreme. That is also the last step of the
miserly mind. A man who has suffered too much because of money, who has
clung to money and could not love anybody or become open, becomes so
frustrated in</p><p>the end that he throws away the money, renounces and goes to the
Himalayas, enters a Tibetan monastery and becomes a lama. This man has
not understood. If you understand, money can be used, but people who
don’t understand are either misers, they can’t use the money, or they
renounce the money, because in renouncing they are also saving the same
mind. Now there will be no difficulty in using it: you renounce all and
escape. But they cannot use the money, they are afraid of using it.</p><p><br></p><p>They can renounce, remember this. I have seen misers renouncing
completely, totally. A man founded a university in Sagar in India, I was
a student there. This man was a rare specimen, his name was Dr. Hari
Singh Gaur. I have never come across a greater miser than him and I have
not come across a greater renouncer either. He was perfect in both the
ways. For his whole life he never gave a single paise to anybody, no
beggar ever received anything from his bungalow.</p><p><br></p><p>If it was known in his town, Sagar, that some beggar was going to
Hari Singh’s house to ask, others would laugh and they would say: Seems
to be new to the town. Nobody ever received anything. He never donated a
single rupee for any cause, humanitarian or anything. For the Indian
National Freedom Movement he never donated a single paise – no, that was
not his way. He was a perfect miser and he was one of the greatest
lawyers in the world. He had three offices, one in India, one in China,
one in England, and he worked four months in England, four months in
India, four months in China. He was one of the best lawyers in the
world. He accumulated so much money and then in the end he donated his
whole life’s savings. The whole university of Sagar is created by a
single person’s donation. It is one of the most beautiful
universities.</p><p><br></p><p>But when he donated, he donated all. You will be surprised to know
that he donated so absolutely that he did not leave a single paise for
his children. Now they are fighting in the courts, they have nothing,
they are beggars on the street. The miser remains a miser to the very
end, even when he renounces. He couldn’t give to his children even a
single paise but he could renounce the whole.</p><p><br></p><p>First you can accumulate money like a madman, then one day you
understand that you wasted your whole life. When you understand this you
become afraid, but the old habit persists. You can give the whole and
forget about it and escape, but you cannot share it.</p><p><br></p><p>If a man of understanding has money he shares it because money is not
for itself, it is for life. If he feels that life needs it, love needs
it, he can throw it away completely, but it is not a renunciation, it is
again using it. Love is the goal for him; money is never the goal, money
is the means. For people who are after money, money is the goal, love
becomes just a means. Even their prayer is for money; even prayer
becomes a means to money.</p><p><br></p><p>Money is a very complex phenomenon. Why do people get so much into
it, and so many people at that? It has a certain appeal, a magnetic
appeal. Money has a hypnotic appeal in it and the appeal is that you can
possess it completely. Money is very docile, it becomes a slave. The ego
feels very fulfilled.</p><p><br></p><p>Love is not docile, love is rebellious. You cannot possess love. You
can possess a woman, you can possess a man, but you can never possess
love. If you possess a woman, the woman has become money, a thing; if
you possess a man, the man has become money, a thing, an instrument. A
man is a man and a woman is a woman only when they are an end unto
themselves, not a means</p><p>to anything else. Money is the means, and to become obsessed with the
means is the greatest foolishness that can occur to a man and the
greatest curse.</p><p><br></p><p>Money should not become the goal, but I am not saying at the same
time that you should renounce it and become beggars – use it, it is a
good means. I’m not against money, I have nothing to say against it. I
am saying something about you and your possessiveness, not about money.
Money can be beautiful – if it is not possessed, if you don’t become
obsessed with it. It can be beautiful. Money is like blood circulating
in the body: in the body of society money circulates, it is blood. It
helps society to be enriched, to be alive – but it is like blood.</p><p><br></p><p>You must have heard about diseases in which the blood stops and
cannot circulate, clots of blood come into existence and they become
blocks and the blood cannot circulate in the body. Then you are
paralyzed, and if the clots happen in the heart you are dead.</p><p><br></p><p>If money circulates, moves from one hand to another, goes on moving,
the more movement the better, then the blood circulates well, then life
is healthy. But when a miser comes in, a clot has happened; somewhere
somebody is accumulating, not sharing, and that is a clot in the blood
circulation. The man disturbs, he does not live himself and because of
his blocking he does not allow others to live. The money has stopped
circulating. Blood circulating is life, blood stopped, blocked, is
death. Money circulating is life, money stopped, blocked, is death.</p><p><br></p><p>I’m for a society where money moves fast, nobody clings to it,
everybody uses it, and you remember that the simple law of money is: the
more you use it, the more valuable it is. For example, we are sitting
here. If ten persons have a hundred rupees in their pockets, and they
keep it to themselves, then ten persons have only one thousand rupees,
dead. But when those rupees circulate, if they make two rounds, ten
thousand have become twenty thousand; if they make three rounds they
have become thirty thousand; and if they make four rounds<span class=s4></span>The more they circulate, the more money</p><p>there is, because when one hundred rupees are kept by one man those
hundred rupees are dead. If he uses them they go to somebody else, then
they come to him again because others are also using them; now he has
two hundred rupees, and again three hundred, four hundred, five
hundred.<span class=s4></span>The</p><p>more you use it, the more money floats and circulates, and the richer
society is.</p><p><br></p><p>America is richest because America is the least miserly country in
the world. Money circulates fast; everybody is using that money which he
has, and even that money which he is going to have in the future, he is
using it too. The country is bound to become rich. A country like India
is bound to remain poor because people cling. If you cling to money the
country will remain poor. When nobody uses it, money becomes like clots
in blood.</p><p><br></p><p>India has two types of people: misers and renouncers. Both these
types are wrong, ill, abnormal, neurotic. One should have money, earn
money, produce money – and use it. One should hold it only to use and
one should use it only to hold; it becomes a circle. Then a person is
both, a miser and a renouncer together. When you are miser and renouncer
together you are neither miser nor renouncer, you simply enjoy
whatsoever money can give. Money can give many things and money cannot
give many things; when you use it then you know what money can give.
Money can give all that is outward – things of this world, nothing is
wrong in them. Nothing is wrong in having a beautiful house. Nothing is
wrong in having a beautiful garden – money can give it to you. But money
cannot give you love, that is expecting too much from poor money.</p><p>One should expect only that which can be expected, one should not
move in the impossibilities..Just asking poor money to give you love –
poor money cannot do it. But nothing is wrong, don’t get angry with the
money! Don’t burn it and throw it in the river and go to the Himalayas.
In the first place you asked something which a man of understanding
would never have asked – you are foolish, that’s all. Nothing is wrong
with the money.</p><p><br></p><p>A wandering monk came to see me two or three years ago and he was
very much against money. He would not even touch it – this is a
neurosis. There are people who only count money the whole day, and in
the night also, in their minds, they go on counting. They touch only
money with a loving hand, they never touch anybody else with a loving
hand. When they look at their currency notes, watch their eyes – they
sparkle. They are hypnotized. These are neurotic people. Then there are
other neurotics... This wandering monk came to me, he would not touch
money. So I said: Then it must be very difficult for you. How did you
come to Bombay to see me? He said: There is nothing difficult. He showed
two other men, his disciples: they could touch, they were not such
evolved beings. What foolishness! They could purchase the ticket and
they could keep the money, but for him, he said: I don’t touch, I have
gone far beyond it.</p><p><br></p><p>I said: But what is the point? Now you are not only using money, you
are using two other persons as your pockets. You have reduced two
persons, alive persons, to pockets; you have murdered. What was wrong in
keeping it in your own pocket?</p><p><br></p><p>And the man said: So it seems you are in favour of money? What can
money give? Can money give love? Can money give God? I said: You are
foolish if you ask love and God from poor money, your expectations are
false. Money never promised them to you, but whatsoever money promises
it can give. It never promises that it can give you love. If you expect
it you are idiotic.</p><p><br></p><p>These people who have been expecting too much from money one day
become enemies of money. Then they escape, then they don’t touch money.
Even Vinoba closes his eyes if you bring money to him, he will not see
it. What nonsense! What is wrong in money? Something still seems to be
miserly inside, something still seems to be like a wound, otherwise why
close your eyes? What is wrong in a currency note? It is just paper, and
these spiritual people go on saying that it is just paper. If you put
ordinary paper in their hands, they touch it, but when you put a
currency note there they throw it away as if it is a scorpion or very
deadly disease.</p><p><br></p><p>Neurosis can move from one extreme to another. Use money. Money is
beautiful as far as it goes, and it goes far enough! As far as the world
is concerned it goes far enough, but don’t expect love, because it is of
the interior, of the inner being, and don’t ask for God, because it is
transcendental.</p><p><br></p><p>Use everything for its own capacities, not for your dreams. Then you
are a healthy man, and to be healthy is to be holy. Don’t be abnormal in
any way. Be normal, ordinary, and just create more understanding so that
you can see. Money can be used, should be used, it can give you a
beautiful world.</p><p><br></p><p>Otherwise, sooner or later, if you are against money you will create
a dirty country like India: everything is dirty – but they think they
are great spiritualists. Everything has gone ugly but they think they
are great spiritualists because they have renounced. That’s why things
have got so bad. They think one has to close one’s eyes and not look
outside.</p><p>It is good to look outside because outside is God’s creation; it is
good to look inside because inside is sitting the Creator. Both are
good. Eyes are meant to blink; they are not meant to remain open forever
and they are not meant to be closed forever. They are meant to blink –
open and close, open and close. That is the rhythm – out and in, out and
in.</p><p><br></p><p>Look outside – the beautiful creation; look inside – the beautiful
God. And by and by you will see that the in and out meet and mingle and
are one.</p><p><br></p><p>The sixth question:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 6</p><p><br></p><p>WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PASSIVITY, AND LAZINESS, A YIN
POSITION AND INERTIA? SOMETIMES I FEEL THAT WITHOUT FORCE OF WILL I
WOULD NEVER GET OUT OF BED.</p><p><br></p><p>There is vast difference between laziness and passivity. Passivity is
alert, laziness is dull; passivity is energy, laziness is nothing but no
energy, a state of no energy. Never get confused between passivity and
laziness: laziness is an ill state of affairs, passivity is just a
wonderful health.</p><p><br></p><p>Passivity is so healthy that it has no need for activity, because the
need to be active may be again an obsession. You cannot remain still,
you feel afraid of being still, you cannot remain with yourself, you
feel afraid of being yourself – so you move into activity. Activity is
an escape. A constant need for occupation is not a good state of
affairs; one should be able to just be passive and enjoy. Enjoy what?
Enjoy the breeze passing, enjoy the clouds moving, enjoy the trees so
happy and so green, enjoy the birds singing. Or just enjoy breathing in
and out, it too is very beautiful: just to be capable of breathing
silently, of being alive, is a tremendous phenomenon. It is a miracle to
feel oneself: I am here and now. This moment I am alive! I can look, I
can listen, I can touch, I can taste – life is happening to me this very
moment, the river of life is flowing through me. Just to feel it.…</p><p><br></p><p>Passivity is alert energy. When I say ‘alert energy’ I mean:
passivity can any moment become activity. Energy is there, you can
transform it into activity any moment, not even a single moment’s notice
has to be given. Out of passivity you can just get up and run for miles
– in fact more than a man who has been active. He may not be able to run
for miles because activity dissipates energy. A man who is passive is
full of energy, a reservoir, and he is alert. If you watch a passive
man... forget man because it will be difficult to find a man and to
watch him: watch a cat, sitting silently, but how alert! Even if her
eyes are closed and even if you see that she is dreaming and nodding the
head – a beautiful dream eating a mouse, you can see the lips moving and
the enjoyment that comes to a cat when she eats the mouse – if there is
just a slight noise everything is alert, the cat is as aware as a
buddha. Suddenly, with not a single moment’s loss, if somebody enters
the room the cat is alert.</p><p><br></p><p>Look at a cat watching near a mouse hole, waiting for the mouse to
come out. How silently, how still she waits. You cannot find such a
perfect yogi because no yogi is so confident about God coming out of his
hole. The cat is perfectly confident, certain, absolutely certain. She
trusts the mouse, he will be coming. And he comes... then look at the
jump, the energy, the radiant energy, the alertness! In a single jump
the mouse is caught.</p><p><br></p><p>And a cat never misses.</p><p>Watch passivity, you will always find it glistening with a reservoir
of life, energy, radiance, any moment ready to jump into activity. The
energy is ready. It is not lethargy, it is not inertia, it is not low
energy. It is energy waiting, it can be transformed any moment.
Lethargy, laziness, is a state of no energy, you are as if you are
almost dead. Then you have to pull yourself out of bed, then you have to
pull yourself out of everything, the whole day: somehow you pull
yourself out of bed, somehow you pull yourself up to prepare tea,
somehow you drink the tea. Somehow you stop breakfast, otherwise you
will go on eating because a lazy man has even no energy to stop
anything. He can sleep or he can eat but then he goes on because who
will stop? For stopping, will will be needed.</p><p><br></p><p>So you drag on, from the morning to the evening and then you have to
drag yourself to bed again because a lazy man cannot just go to bed. One
who has not just come out of bed will never be capable of just going to
bed. No, even that will mean dragging himself. He drags from the club
and the hotel; he somehow drags himself from the TV – otherwise he is
glued to the chair, he cannot get up – somehow puts the TV or radio off,
goes to bed, and somehow drags himself to make love. It is a dragging,
it is a no-energy state, it is not passivity. Don’t think that this is
passivity; this is a disease.</p><p><br></p><p>What to do? First go to the doctor and let your body be checked
because whenever you have some problem always start from the body: you
may be lacking some vitamins in your food, you may be lacking some
hormones in your blood. The first thing is the body, so first take care
of the body. Out of a hundred cases, ninety cases will be immediately
helped by the doctor. For them there is no need to come to me.</p><p><br></p><p>For the other ten cases, if the doctors can’t help you, then come to
me because you must then be concerned with the mind. You are afraid to
live. For these ten per cent I say that it is not really low energy –
you are afraid to get out of bed, you are afraid because life is there.
Again you will have to move in life, meet people, love people, be
friendly, be intimate – anything is possible, anything can happen. You
are afraid of the unknown, you want to remain in the coziness of your
bed. It seems to be protected.</p><p><br></p><p>There are many people who remain ill just because they are afraid of
life; they are not actually ill, they are pretending. If the doctors
cannot help you then come to me. You may be afraid of life.</p><p><br></p><p>It happens almost always. For example, a man is losing business, and
suddenly he has a heart attack. People think it is because he was losing
business. It does have some concern with the losing of the business but
that is not the cause. Now there seems to be no way to be again in the
market, so to save face he is creating his illness. The heart attack is
not created by the business situation, the heart attack is a
psychological defense. Now he can lie in the bed and at least
rationalize that what can he do? He is so ill with the heart attack,
life is in danger, so the business is going. He is going bankrupt
because he is ill.</p><p><br></p><p>Now Lying in bed he can rationalize that it is not his fault, what
can he do? What can he do against fate? Now his wife also cannot say: Go
to the market, go to the shop. Nobody can. Now he has a perfect alibi to
remain in bed.</p><p><br></p><p>He’s afraid to go to the market; you are afraid to go into life. You
cannot encounter life situations, so it is better to live in bed. This
is suicidal. If mind is the case then something can be done; if the</p><p>body is the case then don’t be worried, it can be done by a doctor –
you need not do many great SADHANAS for it.</p><p><br></p><p>First let the body be checked. Then, if mind is the case, we can
solve it. Then we can bring up all the unconscious fears, we can help
them to surface. Once they surface, once they come up into
consciousness, they disappear, and you gather courage. Then there is no
need to use will to get up out of bed. Will is not a good thing. One
should get up out of energy, not because of the will’s effort. One
should get up because one slept so beautifully the whole night that now
one is full of energy. The very energy brings you out of bed, not any
effort of will. Then the whole day you work and live and experience a
thousand and one things, and then you are tired, the day is finished.
That very state brings you to bed again, to relax; you need not drag.
Life should not be a dragging, it should be a spontaneous flowing..</p><p><br></p><p>But first try to solve the bodily problems. If nothing can be done
through the body, then something can always be done through the
mind.</p><p><br></p><p>The last question:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 7</p><p><br></p><p>IS JESUS’ ‘OFFER THE OTHER CHEEK’ ATTITUDE APPLICABLE FOR US TODAY
HERE IN POONA, OR SHOULD WE MEET THE FORCE OFFERED TO US WITH FORCE – OR
SHOULD WE RESPOND AS WE FEEL BEFITS THE SITUATION?</p><p><br></p><p>No, I don’t give you any dogma, I don’t give you any formula to live
up to, because all formulas are false, all formulas are dead, all
formulas create a structure around you and that structure becomes by and
by your imprisonment. I don’t give you any formula, not even the Jesus
formula.</p><p><br></p><p>I want you to be understanding, alert, aware. Let that be your only
source of action.</p><p><br></p><p>Sometimes maybe it is good to offer the other cheek, but only
sometimes. It is relative. Sometimes it is better to hit hard, but that
too sometimes, and one can never predict. You have to watch the whole
situation of a certain moment and live with total response.</p><p><br></p><p>If you carry a formula you will not be free.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard an anecdote. A Christian saint who used to follow Jesus’
sayings word for word, literally, was hit hard by an enemy on one cheek.
Of course he showed him the other cheek because that’s how Jesus said it
had to be done. The man hit him again hard on the other cheek.</p><p><br></p><p>The so-called saint was waiting for this to bring about a conversion
in the man. All Christians think that when you offer the other cheek,
the other man will be so enlightened by your compassion, love, brotherly
feeling, he will be so encompassed by your beautiful gesture of offering
the other cheek that he will simply fall at your feet and become a
disciple. But that doesn’t happen in life, life is not so easy.</p><p><br></p><p>The man, seeing that this saint was offering the other cheek, hit him
hard, harder than at first. Now the saint was a little in doubt about
what to do because Jesus doesn’t say: Then again offer the</p><p>other cheek. Now the formula comes to an end, so he was a little in
doubt. He tried to decide what to do, then jumped on the enemy. The
enemy was surprised. He said: What are you doing? A Christian saint?
First you followed the rule which I was waiting for and you proved that
you are a Christian saint, but what are you doing now? The Christian
saint said: But the formula ends there. Up to now there was Jesus, now
I’m here.</p><p><br></p><p>Even in the time when Jesus was alive somebody asked him about this.
When he said that when somebody hits on your right cheek, you should
give him the left, somebody asked: How many times should it be done?
Will seven times do? Jesus said: Seven times? No, not even seventy-seven
times. I would say to you: Seven hundred and seventy-seven times.</p><p><br></p><p>But then too the end will come. Seven hundred and seventy-seven
times? Then what about the seven hundred and seventy-eighth time? All
formulas come to an end – howsoever long a rope you give to them, they
come to an end. Seven or seventy-seven doesn’t make much difference.</p><p><br></p><p>Formulas are dead, they have limitations. Life is infinite, it has no
limitations.</p><p><br></p><p>Just watch the situation and don’t have any formula in your head;
otherwise you will not be able to watch the situation as it is, the
formula will overcolour the whole thing. You simply put all Jesuses, all
Buddhas, all Rajneeshes aside and just look at the situation. Don’t be
Rajneesh for even two times, from the very beginning be yourself. The
Christian saint had to be himself the third time, when the situation was
again the same. Why wait for that? You be yourself from the very
beginning.</p><p><br></p><p>Then you will never repent. Act out of the total situation, then
there is no repentance. Whatsoever you could do you did. Then you can
move with no scars.</p><p><br></p><p>Let your life be a life of total understanding, that’s all I would
like to say to you. Don’t ask for specific formulas, I have none. I have
only a general attitude – the light of understanding, the fragrance of
understanding. And whatsoever happens in it is good, is virtuous.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part5>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

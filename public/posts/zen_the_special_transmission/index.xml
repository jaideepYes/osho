‌CHAPTER 10
It’s a Special Transmission
10 July 1980 am in Buddha Hall
The first question Question 1 OSHO,
I WILL BE TAKING SANNYAS IN A FEW DAYS. I WOULD LIKE SO MUCH THAT YOU SAY SOMETHING TO ME. I AM AFRAID – THERE ARE DOUBTS – AND I FEEL HAPPINESS ARISE.
Evi Huber,
It is natural to feel afraid when you are entering into something unknown.</description>

‌CHAPTER 2
Come and Get It!
2 July 1980 am in Buddha Hall
The first question Question 1 OSHO,
WHAT IS UNDERSTANDING AND WHAT IS MISUNDERSTANDING?
Dharmaraj,
Mind is misunderstanding – any kind of mind, good or bad, educated or uneducated, cultured or uncultured, Christian or Hindu; it does not matter what kind of mind it is. Mind as such is misunderstanding. Mind means you are carrying a priori conclusions; you are not seeing that which is, you are seeing that which you want to see.</description>

‌CHAPTER 4
At a Time Like This?
4 July 1980 am in Buddha Hall
The first question Question 1 OSHO,
CAN A WOMAN REALLY DRIVE A MAN CRAZY?
Anand Deepesh,
It depends on the man. If he is wise he becomes a henpecked husband; if he is not so wise, then there is no other way than to be crazy. That’s why ninety-nine point nine percent of men decide to be henpecked husbands – just to survive.</description>

‌CHAPTER 6
Wake up, Lazarus!
6 July 1980 am in Buddha Hall
The first question Question 1 OSHO,
DID JESUS REALLY CALL BACK LAZARUS FROM DEATH?
The function of the master is precisely that: to call the disciples to the real life – ordinarily they are dead. Ordinarily you only appear to be alive; don’t be deceived by the appearance. You function like a robot, efficiently, but it is not life.</description>

‌CHAPTER 7
Mind is Gone
7 July 1980 am in Buddha Hall
ONE DAY AN ANGEL, FLYING BACK TO HEAVEN, SAW BELOW HIM A LUXURIANT FOREST ENVELOPED IN A GREAT, GLOWING HALO OF LIGHT. HAVING TRAVELED THROUGH THE SKY MANY MANY TIMES BEFORE, HE NATURALLY HAD SEEN NUMEROUS LAKES, MOUNTAINS AND FORESTS, BUT HAD NEVER PAID MUCH ATTENTION TO THEM. TODAY, HOWEVER, HE NOTICED SOMETHING DIFFERENT – A FOREST SURROUNDED BY A RADIANT AURA, FROM WHICH BEAMS OF LIGHT RADIATED TO EVERY PART OF THE FIRMAMENT.</description>

‌CHAPTER 8
Get It?
8 July 1980 am in Buddha Hall
The first question Question 1 OSHO,
WHAT IS FOR LUNCH TODAY?
Sant Maharaj,
WHAT IS THE MATTER? Are you really becoming a celibate? It happens to celibates: their interest starts changing from women to food. You can look around the Indian sannyasins, the so-called mahatmas, and you will always find them very fat, with big bellies.</description>

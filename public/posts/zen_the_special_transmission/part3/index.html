HE THEN RETURNED TO THE MONASTERY IN WHICH HE HAD BEEN ORDAINED BY HIS “FIRST TEACHER”, THE MONK WHO HAD BROUGHT HIM UP FROM CHILDHOOD AND WHO, AT THAT TIME, WAS A VERY OLD MAN.\nONE DAY SHEN TSAN WAS HELPING HIS OLD TEACHER TO BATHE. WHILE WASHING THE OLD MAN’S BACK, HE SAID TO HIM, “THIS IS SUCH A FINE TEMPLE, BUT THE BUDDHA IN IT IS NOT AT ALL HOLY!” HIS OLD TEACHER THEN TURNED ROUND AND LOOKED AT HIM, WHEREUPON SHEN TSAN COMMENTED, “THOUGH THE BUDDHA IS NOT HOLY, HE CAN STILL RADIATE THE LIGHT.”\nAGAIN, ONE DAY, WHILE THE OLD MAN WAS READING A SUTRA NEAR A PAPER-COVERED WINDOW, A BEE TRIED DESPERATELY, WITH ALL ITS STRENGTH, TO FLY OUT OF THE ROOM THROUGH THE PAPER BUT WAS UNABLE TO GET THROUGH. SHEN TSAN, SEEING THIS, SAID, “THE WORLD IS SO VAST AND WIDE THAT YOU MAY EASILY SET YOURSELF FREE IN IT. WHY, THEN, DO YOU FOOLISHLY BORE INTO OLD, ROTTEN PAPER?”\n“WHILE THE EMPTY DOOR IS OPEN WIDE\nHOW FOOLISH IT IS TO TRY AND GET OUT BY THRUSTING AGAINST THE WINDOW!\nALAS! HOW CAN YOU, MASTER, RAISE YOUR HEAD ABOVE THE SLOUGH BY PUTTING YOUR NOSE AGAINST OLD, ROTTEN PAPER FOR A HUNDRED YEARS?”\nHEARING THIS REMARK, THE OLD MAN LAID DOWN HIS BOO1Z AND SAID TO SHEN TSAN, “FOR QUITE A FEW TIMES NOW, YOU HAVE MADE UNUSUAL REMARKS. FROM WHOM DID YOU GAIN YOUR KNOWLEDGE WHILE YOU WERE AWAY FROM HOME?”\nSHEN TSAN REPLIED, “I HAVE REACHED THE STATE OF PEACEFUL REST THROUGH THE GRACE OF MASTER PAI CHANG. NOW I HAVE COME BACK HOME TO PAY MY DEBT OF GRATITUDE TO YOU.”\nTHE OLD TEACHER THEN PREPARED A GREAT FESTIVAL IN HIS YOUNG DISCIPLE’S HONOR, SUMMONED THE MONKS IN THE MONASTERY TO THE ASSEMBLY HALL, AND BESOUGHT SHEN TSAN TO PREACH THE DHARMA TO ALL. WHEREUPON SHEN TSAN ASCENDED TO THE HIGH SEAT AND, FOLLOWING THE TRADITION OF PAI CHANG, PREACHED AS FOLLOWS:\n“SINGULARLY RADIATING IS THE WONDROUS LIGHT FREE FROM THE BONDAGE OF MATTER AND SENSES. NOT BINDING BY WORDS AND LETTERS,\nTHE ESSENCE IS NAKEDLY EXPOSED IN ITS PURE ETERNITY. NEVER DEFILED IS THE MIND-NATURE;\nIT EXISTS IN PERFECTION FROM THE VERY BEGINNING. BY MERELY CASTING AWAY YOUR DELUSIONS\nTHE SUCHNESS OF BUDDHAHOOD IS REALIZED.”\nAS SOON AS THE OLD TEACHER HEARD THIS STANZA, HE WAS IMMEDIATELY AWAKENED.\nA man phones up the mental hospital and asks, “Can you tell me who is in room number 12, please?” “There is nobody in that room, sir,” comes the reply.\n“Ah good, that means I have escaped!”\nMan is absolutely unaware of his own being. He knows everything else, he tries to know everything else – except his own self, for the simple reason that he takes himself for granted. He thinks as if he knows himself And there is the fundamental error, the most fundamental mistake one can commit.\nWe are, but we don’t know who we are. Our names deceive us: they give us a certain feeling as if this is what we are. Our bodies reflected in the mirror, our faces reflected in people’s eyes, go on giving us a certain idea of our identity. Slowly slowly we gather all this information and create an image of ourselves which is utterly false. This is not the way to know oneself One cannot know oneself by looking in the mirrors because the mirrors can only reflect your body – and you are not\nthe body. You are in the body, but you are not the body. Your behavior, your character, your actions can show your mind, but not you.\nThere is a school of psychologists, one of the most important schools, called the behaviorists. They think man is his behavior: you are nothing but the totality of your actions, so if your actions can be understood you are understood. Man is more, much more than the sum total of his actions; man is not only his behavior. Man is the innermost consciousness of his body, of his mind, of his actions.\nUnless you become conscious of your consciousness, unless you become aware of your inner light, you go on living in illusions. And we perpetuate illusions because they are cheap, easily available; they cost nothing, and they can be handed over to us by others.\nDiscovering oneself is arduous: it is going on the greatest exploration. It is easier to go to the moon, easier to go to the Everest. It is far more difficult to go to one’s own center – for the simple reason that you will have to travel alone, all alone. As one of the great Greek mystics, Plotinus, says, “It is a flight of the alone to the alone.”\nThat’s why very few people have become enlightened, when it is really everybody’s birthright to become enlightened. And even if sometimes, by some accident, people become interested in knowing about themselves, they immediately become victims of words – theories, philosophies, ideologies. They become victims of scriptures, doctrines, dogmas; again they are lost in a jungle of words. Yes, you will find beautiful sayings there, immensely pregnant with meaning, but that meaning will remain hidden to you; you will not be able to discover it. You have not been able to discover yourself; you cannot discover the meaning of the words of Gautam the Buddha or Jesus the Christ or Mahavira the Jain – impossible. You can understand only that much which you have experienced; understanding never goes beyond your experience. Words you can accumulate, you can become scholars, great scholars. And again you will be in a new kind of illusion: the illusion that information creates. The more information you have, the more you start feeling you know.\nInformation is thought to be synonymous with knowing – it is not. Knowing is a totally different affair. Knowing is experiencing; information only accumulates in the memory system. A computer can do it, there is nothing special about it; there is nothing specially human about it.\nTwo large rats walked into a movie house one day and went straight to the projection room. Once inside they ate the entire reel of film. After eating, one rat looked at the other and asked, “Did you like the movie?”\nTo which the other replied, “No, I liked the book better.”\nThese are the scholars – the rats! They go on eating words, they go on accumulating words. They can have mountains of words and they become very articulate about words. They can deceive others; that is not so bad because they can deceive only people who are already deceived; you cannot do much more harm to them. But by deceiving others, slowly slowly they become deceived themselves, and that is the greatest problem.\nNinety-nine percent so-called religious people – saints, mahatmas – are just scholars. As far as words are concerned they are very clever, but if you look deep into their eyes you will find just the same stupid human beings. Nothing has changed.\nThe other day I was reading a statement of Abdul Ghaffar Khan; he is known as the Frontier Gandhi. He is thought to be one of the closest disciples of Mahatma Gandhi. He is ninety-four years old. He has devoted his whole life to the philosophy of nonviolence – and the statement that he gave is so violent that even I was taken aback. I was not thinking that he will do such a stupid thing at such an old age. And the statement was made in front of Vinoba Bhave; they were meeting and there was a press conference. Now both are the greatest followers of Mahatma Gandhi and preachers of nonviolence in the world.\nThe Frontier Gandhi was asked by the journalist, “What do you say about Z.A. Bhutto who has been sentenced to death? Did not you try to save him? – because you believe in nonviolence?”\nHe became furious. His eyes became red with anger and he said, “That man was a sinner! He needed to be burned alive in public!”\nHe completely forgot all about the philosophy of non-violence. He is not happy just by killing him; he wanted him to be burned alive, in public. Not killed on the gallows or shot – that is too merciful – burning alive, because he was a sinner.\nNow, is this man a man of nonviolence? Then Jesus must have been wrong when he prayed to God: “Abba forgive all these people, the people who are crucifying me, because they know not what they are doing. They are unconscious people; they are doing it very unconsciously.”\nJesus is a man of nonviolence, not Abdul Ghaffar Khan. Where he has missed? He became full of beautiful words, but they have not transformed his consciousness. And Vinoba Bhave did not object at all; that means agreement. He was present there; he could have said, “What are you saying? It is not Gandhian at least.” He did not object to it. His silence shows his agreement.\nThis is what has happened to millions of people all over the world. Christians have been killing thousands of people in the name of Christ, with Bibles in their hands, murdering, butchering. Mohammedans have done the same, Hindus have done the same.\nIt is difficult to know how many Buddhist monks were burned by Hindus in India because Indian history does not exist at all, nobody has bothered to write history. But thousands of Buddhist monks were burned alive, just the way Abdul Ghaffar Khan wanted to burn Z.A. Bhutto. Thousands of Buddhists were burned alive – otherwise how they all disappeared from this country? Buddha’s impact was so great, millions of people had turned into Buddhists. Then what happened to all of them? Then why they ran out of the country? And whosoever remained behind was killed.\nAnd Hindus talk about nonviolence, love, friendship, universal love, divine love. As far as words are concerned, people are very clever and they can go on elaborating on these words, philosophizing. They can go in deep subtleties; they can make very subtle distinctions, but their consciousness remains unaffected.\nA young nun arrived at the nunnery, panting and crying, “Mother, Mother, something terrible has happened!”\n“What is it, my daughter?” the Mother Superior asked, concerned.\n“A maniac, Mother – a sex maniac raped me!” “Ah no, daughter, ah no! When did it happen?” “Yesterday, the day before, and again today!”\nYou can impose character on people, but you cannot imagine consciousness. Consciousness has to be discovered. These people can even reach to heaven, but they will create a heaven of their own, they will live in a world of their own. They will repeat the same kind of world there. If these people – these Hindus, Mohammedans, Christians, these monks and nuns and these mahatmas and saints, Catholics and Protestants – if these are the people who are going to heaven, heaven cannot be any different from this earth. The same crusades, the same wars, all kinds of stupidities will go on, will continue. It will be only a repetition, maybe on a wider scale, bigger scale, more sophisticated, but it cannot be qualitatively different.\nYoung Barrington-Smythe had just reached the Pearly Gates. St. Peter was welcoming him and telling him about the social life of heaven. “We play a lot of sport here, young fellow me lad” said St. Peter. “On Mondays and Thursdays it is polo, and Tuesdays and Fridays cricket.”\n“Well, actually, sir,” answered the young man, “I don’t enjoy sport very much.”\n“Well, then perhaps you will enjoy Wednesday nights,” suggested St. Peter. “There is a big dinner. After the meal when the port has been passed around a few times, we really let our hair down, I can tell you!”\n“Actually, sir, I don’t enjoy drinking,” replied the young man.\n“Ah,” said St. Peter. Then after a short silence he suggested, “Then you will enjoy Saturday nights. We have a dance with a lot of the young ladies from hereabouts. Plenty of goings-on, if you know what I mean!”\n“Actually, sir,” said the young man again, “I don’t really enjoy the company of young ladies.”\nAfter a long pause St. Peter asked, “Barrington-Smythe, you are not a homosexual by any chance?” “Oh no sir!”\n“Pity,” said St. Peter, “you won’t enjoy Sunday nights either!”\nThe same people will be transported to heaven, to paradise; it is not going to be any different at all. The question is not of going to heaven, the question is not at all of finding God. The question is knowing “Who am l?” From there real evolution starts – only from there and from nowhere else.\nZen is the most beautiful method ever discovered to enter into the innermost core of your being. It does not believe in character, it only believes in consciousness. By changing your consciousness, your character is changed automatically, but by changing your character your consciousness is not changed in the same way. In fact, your consciousness becomes repressed if you change your\ncharacter. There is created thereby a duality, a split. Your consciousness remains of one type, your character of another type, and they become unbridged. You become two persons or many, even. You become polypsychic you become a crowd. Rather than coming to a rest, rather than coming to deep silence, rather than experiencing peace, you become more neurotic, more noisy. You lose all inner harmony, all accord.\nThat’s what happens to the so-called moralists: they simply go on doing a patchwork from the outside; they go on whitewashing people. Jesus has called this whitewashing ‘whitewashing the graves’. Inside is a stinking corpse and outside you have whitewashed it. From the outside the grave looks beautiful; you can even put roses on it, you can grow flowers on the grave, grass. You can make it look beautiful, but inside it is just a grave.\nAnd that is the situation of man. And the whole thing has happened because we have believed too much in character. We may know, we may not know. Ninety-nine point nine percent people of the world are behaviorists – whatsoever they say does not matter. If you look deep down they belong to the school of Pavlov and Skinner; they all believe in behaviorism. They all believe that your behavior can be changed, then you are changed because you are nothing but your behavior. They may not say so, they may not even be aware of their fundamental belief, but that’s how society has lived up to now. This society is not religious.\nReligious man has yet to arrive, a religious society has yet to happen, a religious culture is yet in the future – on the horizon, but we have to bring it; it has not happened. It has happened in few individual cases here and there, but those people can be counted on fingers.\nThis is a tremendously beautiful story. Go into it very meditatively because each statement contains great treasures.\nZEN MASTER SHEN TSAN GAINED HIS ENLIGHTENMENT THROUGH PAI CHANG.\nTHE FIRST THING is to know the difference between a Master and a teacher. Zen makes a very clearcut distinction: the teacher is one who teaches you; he may not have known himself but he has studied. He is a scholar, he knows the scriptures. He can help you to enter into the world of books; he can introduce you into the intricacies of philosophies, ideologies, doctrines. He can give you education, information, but he cannot bring a transformation to you.\nThe Master is one who brings transformation to your being, who helps you to find out your own light. The work of the teacher is direct; he simply transfers whatsoever he knows to you. Knowledge is transferable, wisdom is not transferable. Hence the work of the Master is indirect, it can never be direct. The Master functions like a catalytic agent – his presence helps. It is like the sun rising in the morning, and the birds start singing. They are awake, flying around, enjoying the new day, welcoming the new day with songs. The sun has not done anything directly to them, but something has happened; a milieu has been created by the sun in which the birds are feeling fresh, young, alive. The flowers start opening. The sun is not coming to each flower and forcing it to open – not in that direct way, but its rays are dancing around the flower. It is giving warmth to the flower, it is encouraging the flower, but in a very delicate way. Flowers have to be tackled in a delicate way; if you force their petals to open you will destroy them. You may be able to open them, but in the very opening you would have killed them; they will not be alive. The sun simply creates a climate\nin which they can open, in which they feel like opening. An inner feel arises in them; some inner instinct synchronizes with the warmth of the sun. And the flowers open and they start exuding their fragrance.\nExactly is the work of the Master. He cannot hand you over what he knows, but he can create a certain energy field in which your petals can open up, in which your seeds can be encouraged, in which you can gather courage enough to take the jump, in which a quantum leap becomes possible.\nHence, enlightenment is not a direct work of the Master. It happens through him, through his grace but not by him.\nZEN MASTER SHEN TSAN GAINED HIS ENLIGHTENMENT THROUGH PAI CHANG.\nRemember the word through – not by.\nHE THEN RETURNED TO THE MONASTERY IN WHICH HE HAD BEEN ORDAINED BY HIS “FIRST TEACHER”...\nNote the difference. Pai Chang is called “Master”, Shen Tsan is called “Master”, but his old teacher is not called “Master”, only “teacher”, because he ordained him only into the world of the scriptures, theories – beautiful theories but all empty, with no content.\nThis was THE MONK WHO HAD BROUGHT HIM UP FROM CHILDHOOD AND WHO, AT THAT TIME, WAS A VERY OLD MAN.\nONE DAY SHEN TSAN WAS HELPING HIS OLD TEACHER TO BATHE. WHILE WASHING THE OLD MAN S BACK, HE SAID TO HIM, “THIS IS SUCH A FINE TEMPLE, BUT THE BUDDHA IN IT IS NOT AT ALL HOLY!”\nThe word “holy” is never used by Zen people in the Christian or the Hindu sense. It is not used in the sense of sacred because for Zen there is nothing sacred and nothing mundane. “Holy” is used in its literal sense of wholeness. One who is whole is holy, one who lives a life of totality is holy. One who lives in a fragmentary way, halfheartedly, divided, wavering, disintegrated, is unholy. It has nothing to do with purity or impurity, remember. It has nothing to do with virtue or sin, remember. The Zen use of the word “holy” simply means one who is whole, one who lives each moment in totality. Whatsoever he is doing he is doing totally. If he is eating he is eating in a holy way; if he is sleeping he is sleeping in a holy way. If he is talking he is talking in a holy way. If he is listening he is listening in a holy way. Whatsoever is the act, his consciousness is totally involved in it, committed to it. He is passionately present in his actions. If he is silent then he is really silent, not only on the surface. You can go on digging deeper and deeper into him, but you will find only silence and silence, layer upon layer. As you go deeper you will find thicker layers of silence. When you reach at the very core you will find nothing but silence. His taste is the same.\nBuddha used to say, “The holy man tastes the same, just like the ocean. You can taste it from anywhere – from this shore or that, from the shore or from the middle – it is always salty. So is the holy man.”\nThe holy man lives not holding back; whatsoever he is doing he goes totally into it.\nShen Tsan was giving a bath to his old teacher. Rubbing his back, he said: “THIS IS SUCH A FINE TEMPLE...”\nEvery body is a fine temple, according to Zen. Every body is a shrine of God; God is enshrined in everyone. You need not go anywhere else to find God; if you can find yourself you have found God. He is hiding within you – he is your within.\n“THIS IS SUCH A FINE TEMPLE,” SHEN TSAN SAID, “BUT THE BUDDHA IN IT IS NOT AT ALL HOLY!”\nMaybe the old teacher was taking a bath and also reciting a sutra. That’s what Buddhist monks do; they will go on taking a bath and reciting a sutra. Hindu pundits do the same, Hindu sannyasins do the same. They will go to take a dip in the Ganges and they will recite gayatri and other mantras. They are divided! If you want to recite gayatri, recite gayatri – forget about taking a bath. And when you are taking a bath, take the bath, forget about gayatri. Then let this bath be your only mantra.\nHe must have been reciting some mantra because they think, “Why waste time? You can do both the things.” They will go on eating and they will go on reciting inside a certain sacred mantra. Why waste time? But then you are missing the totality of eating, then you are not tasting your food. How can you do it? The mind is capable of doing only one thing at a time; it cannot do two things together – it is impossible. If you are eating, then let your whole consciousness be that of taste, of smell. Forget everything! Then even ordinary bread may taste like the most delicious food possible. But you are not present.\nLook at people eating – they are talking, there are people who are listening to the radio or seeing to the TV. I have heard about stupid Americans even making love while seeing the TV! – what to say about eating? Why miss? You can do both the things – you can make love and you can go on seeing the TV. Now, neither you will be seeing the TV nor you will be making love; you will not be able to enjoy either, you will miss both. There are people who cannot eat if they don’t have company to talk and gossip and to discuss. When you are talking you go on swallowing – swallowing is not eating.\nEating should be meditative, prayerful. You should be more respectful to food because it is life, it is nourishment. And then thousand and one problems arise out of it. Because while you are eating you are reading the newspaper or quarreling with the wife or listening to the radio or looking at the TV or talking to a friend or holding the phone, you will miss the joy of eating. You will eat more because your taste buds will not feel fulfilled and contented. Then you will gather unnecessary fat in the body. Then one has to start dieting, fasting, naturopathy and all kinds of nonsense follow. But the simple thing that should have been done in the first place was: just eating and not doing anything else.\nWhen Lin Chi was asked, “What is your meditation?” he said, “When I eat I simply eat, and when I sleep I simply sleep. When I walk I simply walk.”\nThe person who was asking said, “But this is what we all do.”\nLin Chi said, “No, that’s not what you do. When you are eating you go on doing thousand and one other things too. I know it because I had been just like you before I became enlightened. I had lived\nin the same mad and stupid way, so I know how you are living. Don’t say to me that this is what everybody does.”\nThe most stupid thing in life is to live halfheartedly, because the moment that is gone is gone forever. But people are living so unconsciously that it is almost impossible for them to be conscious of what they are doing.\nA guy was coming home from work to his house in a suburban residential neighborhood of a typical American city. The houses were in a large compound surrounded by beautiful lawns. While he was walking, a tremendous bellyache gripped him. It was already dark and there were three more blocks to go, so he decided to relieve his bellyache under the bush next to a nearby house. He finished, stood up, closed his pants and took a look to see his work. What a surprise! There was nothing. The grass was clean, very clean. Just to make sure he lit his cigarette lighter but there was nothing there, so very puzzled he went home.\nThat night he could not sleep for thinking about the mystery of the disappearing shit and when he found his lighter missing the next day he went back to the garden. He found the lighter but no trace of the shit.\nStraightening up, his eyes met those of an offended old lady. “Ah!” she cried. “So you are the one who shit on my turtle!”\nIf you watch your life you will see what you go on doing. And it is not only so about the ordinary people, but the people you call very extraordinary, the geniuses; they are also as unconscious as you are, or even more so.\nIt is said about Karl Marx, the founder of communism, that one day studying in the British Museum he for the first time came across the theory that if you drink or you smoke, or you use anything, you can save money by using it more. For example, if you are smoking a cigarette of a very costly brand and you start using a cheaper cigarette, on each cigarette you will be saving money; the more cigarettes you smoke, the more money will be saved. He was thrilled.\nHe went to the marketplace – he was a chain-smoker – he purchased the cheapest kind of cigarette, as many as he could carry to the house. His wife could not believe her eyes: “So many packets he is bringing – is he going to open a shop or something?” She asked, “What is the matter?”\nAnd he was so joyous, he said, “Wait! Now there is no need to work. We can save money only by smoking more and more. You also start smoking, and don’t stop children either from smoking. And whosoever comes to the home, let them smoke as much as we smoke – more money will be saved. On each cigarette so much money is going to be saved!” And he closed the doors and started smoking.\nThe wife thought, “He has gone crazy How you can save money if you go on smoking, just smoking?” She called his friend, Friedrich Engels, who tried hard to argue with him that, “You are being foolish!” It took hours for him to convince him that “This is nonsense! You will die of cancer or some dangerous disease – and money will not be saved! The theory is correct only if you smoke twelve cigarettes of a costly brand and twelve cigarettes of cheap brand; then you will be saving money. But that does not mean you go on smoking cigarettes day and night and then there is no need to work.”\nNow people like Karl Marx, who are thought to be very logical, can behave in a very unconscious way.\nOne day it happened:\nEdison was writing some letters. His wife came, and she knew that he never likes to be disturbed in the middle of his work because sometimes he loses track of his theory. She had brought his breakfast, so she kept the breakfast by the side and went away to do some other work.\nMeanwhile a friend came. Seeing the breakfast is getting cold and he is so much in his writing, just to play a joke on him he ate the breakfast. When he finished the letter he looked around. He saw the empty plate he said to the friend, “Sorry, you came a little late – I have finished my breakfast.” Seeing the plate empty he thought he must have finished, he must have eaten the breakfast.\nNot even the ordinary people, but your so-called geniuses... Edison is one the greatest talented persons ever: he discovered one thousand things – one thousand things is a rare achievement – but remained his whole life unconscious, so much so that once he forgot his own name.\nIt is said of Immanuel Kant, a great German philosopher, that he had to be reminded of every small thing he lived such an unconscious life. Each small thing had to be reminded to him, even things like this:\nOne day he came home after his evening walk, stood in the comer of the room, laid down his walking-stick on the bed thinking that he is lying on the bed and the walking-stick is standing in the comer of the room. The servant, seeing the light on, looked through the keyhole, was puzzled – what is happening? – because he saw Immanuel Kant standing in the corner of the room and the stick lying down on the bed. He knocked on the door.\nImmanuel Kant opened the door and the servant asked, “What is the matter? What are you doing?”\nHe said, “I also am feeling a little bit strange. Something is wrong, but I am not exactly certain what it is. I am feeling very tired!”\nEvery man has a Buddha inside him, but the Buddha is not holy, is not whole. We are living in fragments. Somebody is living in his head, somebody is living in his body, somebody is living somewhere else. Somebody is focused on the money, somebody on power, somebody on some other trip, some other number. But nobody is wholly, fully aware what he is doing, what he is being.\n“THIS IS SUCH A FINE TEMPLE,” SHEN TSAN SAID, “BUT THE BUDDHA IN IT IS NOT AT ALL HOLY!” HIS OLD TEACHER TURNED ROUND AND LOOKED AT HIM, WHEREUPON SHEN TSAN COMMENTED, “THOUGH THE BUDDHA IS NOT HOLY, HE CAN STILL RADIATE THE LIGHT.”\nIn that moment when the old teacher looked back – shocked in a way, because what Shen Tsan had said was very shocking, in a way rude from a disciple, saying that he is not holy! – in that shock his mind must have stopped. And looking at Shen Tsan for a moment he must have been in a state of no-mind – just for a moment. And that is the moment when you start radiating the Buddha.\n... SHEN TSAN COMMENTED, “THOUGH THE BUDDHA IS NOT HOLY, HE CAN STILL RADIATE THE LIGHT.”\nOnce in a while... so if he can radiate the light once in a while he can radiate the light forever. It is only a question of little more awareness.\nAGAIN, ONE DAY, WHILE THE OLD MAN WAS READING A SUTRA NEAR A PAPER-COVERED WINDOW, A BEE TRIED DESPERATELY, WITH ALL ITS STRENGTH, TO FLY OUT OF THE ROOM THROUGH THE PAPER BUT WAS UNABLE TO GET THROUGH.\nBEES SEEM TO HAVE something like human minds, exactly the same kind of stupidity. The doors may be open, but if a bee is inside the room, caught inside the room... and she may have come from the open door but she will try to get out from the closed window. Not only bees but other birds also behave in the same way. Any bird can enter in your room; the doors are open, he has come from the door, but he cannot go back from the same door. He starts trying to get through the wall, through the ceiling... and the more he tries, the more desperate he becomes, because there is no way to get through the ceiling or through the wall or through the closed window. And in that desperation, frustration he becomes more and more blind, afraid, scared. He loses all intelligence. And the same is the case with human beings.\nOne day Buddha came into his assembly of the monks. It must have been just a morning like this. His sannyasins were sitting and waiting for him. They were puzzled because this was for the first time that Buddha had come with something in his hand – a handkerchief. They all looked at the handkerchief What was the matter? There must be something special in it. And Buddha sat on the platform and rather than starting speaking to the assembly he looked at the handkerchief, started tying a few knots in it, five knots in all. The whole assembly watched – what is going on?\nAnd then he asked the assembly, “Can anybody tell me: is this handkerchief the same as it was before the knots were tied?”\nSariputta said, “This is a tricky question. In a way the handkerchief is the same because nothing has changed, in a way it is not the same because these five knots have appeared which were not there before. But as far as the inner nature of the handkerchief is concerned – its nature is concerned – it is the same; but as far as its form is concerned it is no more the same. The form has changed: the substance is the same.”\nBuddha said, “Right. Now I want to open these knots.” And he started stretching both ends of the handkerchief farther away from each other. He asked Sariputta. “What do you think? By stretching farther will I be able to open the knots?”\nHe said, “You will be making knots even more difficult to open because they will become smaller, more tighter. ’\nBuddha said, “Right. Then I want to ask the last question: what should I do so that I can open the knots, the tied knots? How I can untie them again?”\nSariputta said, “Bhagwan, I would like first to come close and see how in the first place the knots have been tied. Unless I know how they have been tied it is difficult for me to suggest any solution.”\nBuddha said, “Right, Sariputta. You are blessed, because that is the most fundamental question to ask. If you are in a certain fix, the first thing is how you got into it rather than trying to get out of it. Without asking the most fundamental and the primary question, you will make things worse.”\nAnd that’s what people are doing. They ask, “How we can get out of our sexuality, greed, anger, attachment, jealousy, possessiveness, this and that?” without asking, “How in the first place we get into them?”\nBuddha’s whole approach is, first see how you get into anger. If you can see the entrance, the same door is the exit; no other door is needed. But without knowing the entrance if you try to find out the exit you are not going to find; you will get more and more desperate. And that’s what people go on doing.\nIn the scriptures, what are you looking for? – solutions. You create the problems – and the solutions are in the scriptures! Why don’t you look at the problems yourself. How you create them? Why don’t you watch when you are creating a certain problem? And you create every day, so it is not a question that you have to go back. Today you are going to be angry again, today you will feel again the sexual urge: see how it arises, see how you enter into it, how you get hooked into it, how it becomes so big like a cloud that surrounds you and you are lost in it. And then you go to ask others!\nYou are functioning almost like a stupid bee. Bees can be forgiven, but you cannot be forgiven.\nShen Tsan is using all opportunities to make his old teacher aware what has happened to him. He does not want to say directly because it cannot be said directly. It will be too impolite to say directly that, “I have become enlightened.” That may hinder rather than help; the old teacher’s ego may be hurt. And enlightenment cannot be claimed; you have to produce proofs of it. You have to be very seductive about it, and that’s what he is doing. He is being very seductive; he is throwing here and there a few remarks just like arrows, hitting from every direction in the very heart of the old teacher, to make him aware that Shen Tsan is not the same person as he had left him. A totally new being has come to him, a new consciousness is born into him. He is reborn.\n... WHILE THE OLD MAN WAS READING A SUTRA...\nNow he has become old, but is still reading a sutra. Sutras are good when you are children, sutras are good when you are young, but there is a time when you should become mature enough to go beyond information and start looking for transformation. Now this man is getting so old; still with trembling hands he must be holding an ancient sutra, still looking for some exit.\nAnd the beautiful opportunity arose because a bee entered into the room. Now the bee has entered from the open door. From where it will enter? How have you entered into the world? How you enter every day when you get up in the morning into the world again?\nHave you ever watched? – when for the first moment you become aware in the morning that sleep has left, there is a gap of a few seconds in which the mind does not exist – only a few seconds. Sleep is no more and the world has not started yet. The mind will take a little time to start. There is a gap, an interval, a few seconds. If you are alert enough you will be able to see how you enter every day into the world. What is your first thought? Can you say what was your first thought today? You must have entered, but you are not aware at all.\nWe live so mechanically. Each moment is an opportunity, but we go on losing it in our stupidity.\n... THE BEE TRIED DESPERATELY WITH ALL ITS STRENGTH... WITH ALL ITS WILLPOWER... TO FLY OUT OF THE ROOM THROUGH THE PAPER.\nThat’s what the yogis, the so-called ascetics are trying to do with all their will, with all their effort, endeavor, with all their strength. They are trying to get through the wall rather than sitting silently, becoming calm and quiet, looking around for the door from where they have entered in.\nThe most important thing whenever you are in a problem is not to start immediately doing something, otherwise you will make the problem worse. The most significant thing is for the time being not to do anything at all. Just sit silently, relax, rest, be in a let-go. Rather than trying to find out the way, watch from where you have entered, because each problem has its own solution and each question has its own answer in it. If you are careful enough, conscious enough, you will be able to find it there, and nowhere else you can find it. No scriptures are going to help.\nTHE BEE WAS TRYING, WITH ALL ITS STRENGTH, TO FLY OUT OF THE ROOM THROUGH THE PAPER BUT WAS UNABLE TO GET THROUGH. SHEN TSAN, SEEING THIS, SAID, “THE WORLD IS SO VAST AND WIDE THAT YOU MAY EASILY SET YOURSELF FREE IN IT. WHY, THEN, DO YOU FOOLISHLY BORE INTO OLD, ROTTEN PAPER?”\nNow this was too much! The Master is reading some old scripture. And older the scripture is, people think, the better it is; the more rotten, the more important they think; the more ancient, the more significant they think.\nZen believes in burning the scriptures. The most famous Zen painting is Bodhidharma burning scriptures, throwing them into fire. It does not mean literally. There are fools...\nI had a painting when I used to live in Jabalpur – a friend brought a painting of Bodhidharma burning the scriptures. A young man used to come to me; he saw the painting, he asked me the meaning. I told him the meaning. He went home, he burned all his scriptures. And then he could not sleep the whole night because he became very much disturbed. The gods may become angry – what he has done?\nEarly in the morning, four o’clock, he knocked on my door. He said, “Save me – I am getting mad! What you suggested I have done – I have burned the scriptures. My mother is mad, my father is mad. My whole family is thinking that I have to be put into a mental asylum because I have burned the SRIMAD BHAGAVAD GITA, and they say this is the most sacrilegious act. And they cannot believe and I tried to convince them about you and about your ideas, and they said, ‘That man is mad and you are mad!’ What am I supposed to do now? I could not sleep the whole night. I myself am afraid. Krishna must have felt offended. Now how can I be saved?”\nI told him, “How many scriptures did you have?” He said, “I had the RAMAYANA and the SRIMAD BHAGAVAD GITA and few others.”\nI phoned to a bookseller and ordered those books and gave the young man those books and I told him never to come to me again, “Because you are not the person to come here – you are a fool!\nThat painting and whatsoever I had said was not to be taken literally; it is a metaphor. It is significant as a metaphor. Yes, you have to burn all the scriptures from your mind. Burning old, rotten paper is not going to help. If it is not going to help by reading it, how is it going to help by burning it? It is the same old rotten paper whether you read it or you burn it.”\nThe Master must have felt something has to be done now, and as the Master felt that his disciple is no more the same, Shen Tsan said this beautiful sutra:\n“WHILE THE EMPTY DOOR IS OPEN WIDE HOW FOOLISH IT IS TO TRY TO GET OUT BY THRUSTING AGAINST THE WINDOW! ALAS! HOW CAN YOU, MASTER,\nRAISE YOUR HEAD ABOVE THE SLOUGH\nBY PUTTING YOUR NOSE AGAINST OLD, ROTTEN PAPER FOR A HUNDRED YEARS?”\nFirst he has said as if he was talking to the bee, now he has directly said to the Master. Now he felt, “The time is ripe – now the Master is ready to listen.”\nHEARING THIS REMARK, THE OLD MAN LAID DOWN HIS BOOK AND SAID TO SHEN TSAN, “FOR QUITE A FEW TIMES NOW, YOU HAVE MADE UNUSUAL REMARKS”\nONLY BUDDHAS can make unusual remarks; they are bound to make unusual remarks. It is only through wisdom that the fire of rebellion arises. Knowledge is conventional, pundits are traditional. Only the enlightened people are the salt of the earth.\nTHE OLD TEACHER SAID, “FOR QUITE A FEW TIMES NOW, YOU HAVE MADE UNUSUAL REMARKS. FROM WHOM DID YOU GAIN YOUR KNOWLEDGE WHILE YOU WERE AWAY FROM HOME?”\nSHEN TSAN REPLIED, “I HAVE REACHED THE STATE OF PEACEFUL REST...”\nThis was the time now, the right time. Everything has to be said at a certain right time; if you say it when the time is not right it is useless. Hence the Master has to wait, wait for the right season, for the right climate, for the right moment. One never knows when it will come, but when it comes, only then the awakening is possible.\nSHEN TSAN REPLIED, “L HAVE REACHED THE STATE OF PEACEFUL REST... I HAVE COME TO MY CENTER... THROUGH THE GRACE OF MASTER PAI CHANG”\nRemember the word “grace”: not through the effort but through the grace.\n“NOW I HAVE COME BACK HOME TO PAY MY DEBT OF GRATITUDE TO YOU.\n“And I have come back home because you had brought me up, you have worked hard with me. Whatsoever you knew you have tried to impart to me. Of course, you were not enlightened and you could not help me to become enlightened, but without you perhaps I would not have been able to find the right man, Pai Chang.”\nAnd Pai Chang was a rare man. He was not a monk, he was not a bhikkhu, a sannyasin, he lived the life of an ordinary, worldly man. He remained a layman his whole life, even after he became enlightened. He never stopped his ordinary activities. He had thousands of followers by and by, many people gathered around him, but he continued to do his usual work. Many people invited him, even the king, that “You need not work any more – we can make a big monastery for you. You have so many followers there is no need for you to work. You can help people.”\nHe said, “I am helping. This is the only way I can help people. I would like to remain in the marketplace.”\nThis old teacher may have been far more famous; he had many disciples – Pai Chang was just a layman – but now was the right time to say to him. First he may not have listened at all, may have felt offended, but Shen Tsan said, “I had to come to you to pay my respects, my gratitude. You have done much for me – you prepared me for Pai Chang.”\nA real seeker always feels grateful, to everybody, whosoever has helped him in any possible way. He feels grateful to his parents, he feels grateful to all his teachers; he feels grateful even to people who have deceived him, who were pseudo, who were not real teachers even, who were cheaters. But he feels grateful even to them, because they all have helped you – positively, negatively, in some way or other.\nIf you are here, you are here because of many many people, good and bad both. And the day you become reborn, remember it, that you owe something to everybody, whosoever has helped you in any way. The husband who has divorced you, the wife who has left you and gone with somebody else, the parents who abandoned you, who have forgotten all about you, the many pseudo teachers who roam around the world exploiting people, they all have helped in certain ways. When you will become enlightened you will know how they all have helped. If the husband has not divorced you you may not have been here at all – you may be still hanging with the fool! You owe much gratefulness to him. The wife who left you and went with somebody else, don’t carry any grudge against her; she has done a great service to you, otherwise you may not have been here. She may be still nagging you!\nEverything that has happened has been good. Once you attain to the ultimate rest it makes everything golden. Even nights, dark nights become sources of the beautiful mornings, beautiful dawns.\nTHE OLD TEACHER THEN PREPARED A GREAT FESTIVAL IN HIS YOUNG DISCIPLE’S HONOR, SUMMONED THE MONKS IN THE MONASTERY TO THE ASSEMBLY HALL, AND BESOUGHT SHEN TSAN TO PREACH THE DHARMA TO ALL. WHEREUPON SHEN TSAN ASCENDED TO THE HIGH SEAT AND, FOLLOWING THE TRADITION OF PAI CHANG, PREACHED AS FOLLOWS...\nTHE OLD TEACHER understood it immediately, even though he was just reading the scriptures, but must have been a man of insight and understanding, not just a stupid scholar – a scholar, but searching for something more, trying to transcend words and reach to the content. He immediately recognized the light that had come to the face of his disciple. He could see the radiance, he could feel the fragrance. And then he was not miserly in any way. He respected him, arranged for a great festival, a great ceremony in his honor, called the whole assembly, all his students and disciples, and asked him to ascend and preach the dharma to all.\nWHEREUPON SHEN TSAN ASCENDED TO THE HIGH SEAT...\nand spoke these few, but they are tremendously beautiful:\n“SINGULARLY RADIATING IS THE WONDROUS LIGHT\nFREE FROM THE BONDAGE OF MATTER AND THE SENSES.”\nIf you become conscious you immediately know that you are not the body nor the mind; you are pure consciousness, and that pure consciousness is the wondrous light. That is the light Buddha has said about: “Be a light unto yourself.”\n“NOT BINDING BY WORDS AND LETTERS...”\nIt is not confined to any words or any letters. It is beyond all descriptions, beyond all expression, beyond all definitions.\n“THE ESSENCE IS NAKEDLY EXPOSED IN ITS PURE ETERNITY.”\nBut if you have eyes to see, if you have intelligence it is available in all its nakedness, in all its eternal purity, in its absolute, essential beauty it is available. Every moment is available; just it is because of your stupidity, your mediocrity, your mind, that it remains hidden. It is not hidden; your consciousness is clouded.\n“NEVER DEFILED IS THE MIND-NATURE...”\nAnd remember, whatsoever you do, whatsoever you have done, you cannot defile your innermost core. Your center remains unaffected by the circumference, your consciousness remains unaffected by your character. The cyclone cannot touch the center. You are the center of the cyclone.\n“IT EXISTS IN PERFECTION FROM THE VERY BEGINNING.”\nAnd you are not to attain to perfection. This is the Zen discovery: that you are not to attain it, it is already the case. You are perfect from the very beginning.\n“BY MERELY CASTING AWAY YOUR DELUSIONS...”\nAll that is needed is just cast away your delusions. “THE SUCHNESS OF BUDDHAHOOD IS REALIZED.”\nAnd immediately you realize you have been the Buddha since the beginning. You have always been the Buddha and nobody else. You have been a god from the very beginning, you cannot be otherwise. Godliness is your intrinsic essence, it is nothing to be achieved. And it is impossible to defile it – no karma can defile it.\nSo whatsoever you have done you have done only in your dreams. When you wake up, whether you dreamed of being a sinner or being a saint does not matter. When you wake up, both the dreams are finished; you don’t bother at all. You don’t feel guilty that you have been a sinner in your dreams and you don’t feel “holier-than-thou” because you have been a saint in your dreams. Dreams are dreams, illusions. The awakened person is freed from all dreams.\n“THE SUCHNESS OF BUDDHAHOOD IS REALIZED.”\nYou are Buddhas right now, this very moment!\nAS SOON AS THE OLD TEACHER HEARD THIS STANZA, HE WAS IMMEDIATELY AWAKENED.\nThis is the lion’s roar: You are Buddhas this very moment, right now! Nothing has to be attained, nothing has to be changed. Wake up! Listening to this lion’s roar, the old teacher immediately became awakened. All that is needed is intelligence, all that is needed is understanding the point, a capacity to be available to the Master.\nThis old man must have been rare. It must be said about him that he was able even to receive the message from his own disciple. He must have been a humble man; he must have been able to put his ego aside. And that is the greatest delusion. He immediately became awakened.\nIn Zen this is called the special transmission: the transmission beyond words, beyond scriptures. What is said is not the real thing, but what was heard was the real thing. What is said, you have heard it; but what the old man heard you have not yet heard. The day you hear it you will know what it is: the special transmission.\nIt is like when you bring an unlit candle close to a lit candle. Suddenly from the lit candle the flame jumps to the unlit candle. The lit candle loses nothing and the unlit candle gains everything. This is the special transmission – beyond words, beyond scriptures.\nIn that moment when Shen Tsan shouted:\n“BY MERELY CASTING AWAY YOUR DELUSIONS THE SUCHNESS OF BUDDHAHOOD IS REALIZED\n“... and your self-nature is never defiled, and you are perfect from the very beginning,” the old man immediately became awakened Just like sudden lightning... and all darkness has disappeared and disappeared forever. In fact, it never existed in the first place; you were simply imagining it.\nAll misery is in your imagination. When this imaginary misery is dropped there is nothing left but bliss, benediction, ecstasy.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"8909","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/zen_the_special_transmission/part3/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/zen_the_special_transmission/>Zen.

THEN RETURNED TO THE MONASTERY IN WHICH HE HAD BEEN ORDAINED BY HIS
“FIRST TEACHER”, THE MONK WHO HAD BROUGHT HIM UP FROM CHILDHOOD AND WHO,
AT THAT TIME, WAS A VERY OLD MAN.</p><p><br></p><p>ONE DAY SHEN TSAN WAS HELPING HIS OLD TEACHER TO BATHE. WHILE WASHING
THE OLD MAN’S BACK, HE SAID TO HIM, “THIS IS SUCH A FINE TEMPLE, BUT THE
BUDDHA IN IT IS NOT AT ALL HOLY!” HIS OLD TEACHER THEN TURNED ROUND AND
LOOKED AT HIM, WHEREUPON SHEN TSAN COMMENTED, “THOUGH THE BUDDHA IS NOT
HOLY, HE CAN STILL RADIATE THE LIGHT.”</p><p><br></p><p>AGAIN, ONE DAY, WHILE THE OLD MAN WAS READING A SUTRA NEAR A
PAPER-COVERED WINDOW, A BEE TRIED DESPERATELY, WITH ALL ITS STRENGTH, TO
FLY OUT OF THE ROOM THROUGH THE PAPER BUT WAS UNABLE TO GET THROUGH.

MAY EASILY SET YOURSELF FREE IN IT. WHY, THEN, DO YOU FOOLISHLY BORE

HALL, AND BESOUGHT SHEN TSAN TO PREACH THE DHARMA TO ALL. WHEREUPON SHEN
TSAN ASCENDED TO THE HIGH SEAT AND, FOLLOWING THE TRADITION OF PAI
CHANG, PREACHED AS FOLLOWS:</p><p><br></p><p>“SINGULARLY RADIATING IS THE WONDROUS LIGHT FREE FROM THE BONDAGE OF
MATTER AND SENSES. NOT BINDING BY WORDS AND LETTERS,</p><p>THE ESSENCE IS NAKEDLY EXPOSED IN ITS PURE ETERNITY. NEVER DEFILED IS
THE MIND-NATURE;</p><p>IT EXISTS IN PERFECTION FROM THE VERY BEGINNING. BY MERELY CASTING
AWAY YOUR DELUSIONS</p><p>THE SUCHNESS OF BUDDHAHOOD IS REALIZED.”</p><p><br></p><p>AS SOON AS THE OLD TEACHER HEARD THIS STANZA, HE WAS IMMEDIATELY
AWAKENED.</p><p><br></p><p>A man phones up the mental hospital and asks, “Can you tell me who is
in room number 12, please?” “There is nobody in that room, sir,” comes
the reply.</p><p>“Ah good, that means I have escaped!”</p><p><br></p><p>Man is absolutely unaware of his own being. He knows everything else,
he tries to know everything else – except his own self, for the simple
reason that he takes himself for granted. He thinks as if he knows
himself And there is the fundamental error, the most fundamental mistake
one can commit.</p><p><br></p><p>We are, but we don’t know who we are. Our names deceive us: they give
us a certain feeling as if this is what we are. Our bodies reflected in
the mirror, our faces reflected in people’s eyes, go on giving us a
certain idea of our identity. Slowly slowly we gather all this
information and create an image of ourselves which is utterly false.
This is not the way to know oneself One cannot know oneself by looking
in the mirrors because the mirrors can only reflect your body – and you
are not</p><p>the body. You are in the body, but you are not the body. Your
behavior, your character, your actions can show your mind, but not
you.</p><p><br></p><p>There is a school of psychologists, one of the most important
schools, called the behaviorists. They think man is his behavior: you
are nothing but the totality of your actions, so if your actions can be
understood you are understood. Man is more, much more than the sum total
of his actions; man is not only his behavior. Man is the innermost
consciousness of his body, of his mind, of his actions.</p><p><br></p><p>Unless you become conscious of your consciousness, unless you become
aware of your inner light, you go on living in illusions. And we
perpetuate illusions because they are cheap, easily available; they cost
nothing, and they can be handed over to us by others.</p><p><br></p><p>Discovering oneself is arduous: it is going on the greatest
exploration. It is easier to go to the moon, easier to go to the
Everest. It is far more difficult to go to one’s own center – for the
simple reason that you will have to travel alone, all alone. As one of
the great Greek mystics, Plotinus, says, “It is a flight of the alone to
the alone.”</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why very few people have become enlightened, when it is really
everybody’s birthright to become enlightened. And even if sometimes, by
some accident, people become interested in knowing about themselves,
they immediately become victims of words – theories, philosophies,
ideologies. They become victims of scriptures, doctrines, dogmas; again
they are lost in a jungle of words. Yes, you will find beautiful sayings
there, immensely pregnant with meaning, but that meaning will remain
hidden to you; you will not be able to discover it. You have not been
able to discover yourself; you cannot discover the meaning of the words
of Gautam the Buddha or Jesus the Christ or Mahavira the Jain –
impossible. You can understand only that much which you have
experienced; understanding never goes beyond your experience. Words you
can accumulate, you can become scholars, great scholars. And again you
will be in a new kind of illusion: the illusion that information
creates. The more information you have, the more you start feeling you
know.</p><p><br></p><p>Information is thought to be synonymous with knowing – it is not.
Knowing is a totally different affair. Knowing is experiencing;
information only accumulates in the memory system. A computer can do it,
there is nothing special about it; there is nothing specially human
about it.</p><p><br></p><p>Two large rats walked into a movie house one day and went straight to
the projection room. Once inside they ate the entire reel of film. After
eating, one rat looked at the other and asked, “Did you like the
movie?”</p><p><br></p><p>To which the other replied, “No, I liked the book better.”</p><p><br></p><p>These are the scholars – the rats! They go on eating words, they go
on accumulating words. They can have mountains of words and they become
very articulate about words. They can deceive others; that is not so bad
because they can deceive only people who are already deceived; you
cannot do much more harm to them. But by deceiving others, slowly slowly
they become deceived themselves, and that is the greatest problem.</p><p><br></p><p>Ninety-nine percent so-called religious people – saints, mahatmas –
are just scholars. As far as words are concerned they are very clever,
but if you look deep into their eyes you will find just the same stupid
human beings. Nothing has changed.</p><p>The other day I was reading a statement of Abdul Ghaffar Khan; he is
known as the Frontier Gandhi. He is thought to be one of the closest
disciples of Mahatma Gandhi. He is ninety-four years old. He has devoted
his whole life to the philosophy of nonviolence – and the statement that
he gave is so violent that even I was taken aback. I was not thinking
that he will do such a stupid thing at such an old age. And the
statement was made in front of Vinoba Bhave; they were meeting and there
was a press conference. Now both are the greatest followers of Mahatma
Gandhi and preachers of nonviolence in the world.</p><p><br></p><p>The Frontier Gandhi was asked by the journalist, “What do you say
about Z.A. Bhutto who has been sentenced to death? Did not you try to
save him? – because you believe in nonviolence?”</p><p><br></p><p>He became furious. His eyes became red with anger and he said, “That
man was a sinner! He needed to be burned alive in public!”</p><p><br></p><p>He completely forgot all about the philosophy of non-violence. He is
not happy just by killing him; he wanted him to be burned alive, in
public. Not killed on the gallows or shot – that is too merciful –
burning alive, because he was a sinner.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, is this man a man of nonviolence? Then Jesus must have been
wrong when he prayed to God: “Abba forgive all these people, the people
who are crucifying me, because they know not what they are doing. They
are unconscious people; they are doing it very unconsciously.”</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus is a man of nonviolence, not Abdul Ghaffar Khan. Where he has
missed? He became full of beautiful words, but they have not transformed
his consciousness. And Vinoba Bhave did not object at all; that means
agreement. He was present there; he could have said, “What are you
saying? It is not Gandhian at least.” He did not object to it. His
silence shows his agreement.</p><p><br></p><p>This is what has happened to millions of people all over the world.
Christians have been killing thousands of people in the name of Christ,
with Bibles in their hands, murdering, butchering. Mohammedans have done
the same, Hindus have done the same.</p><p><br></p><p>It is difficult to know how many Buddhist monks were burned by Hindus
in India because Indian history does not exist at all, nobody has
bothered to write history. But thousands of Buddhist monks were burned
alive, just the way Abdul Ghaffar Khan wanted to burn Z.A. Bhutto.
Thousands of Buddhists were burned alive – otherwise how they all
disappeared from this country? Buddha’s impact was so great, millions of
people had turned into Buddhists. Then what happened to all of them?
Then why they ran out of the country? And whosoever remained behind was
killed.</p><p><br></p><p>And Hindus talk about nonviolence, love, friendship, universal love,
divine love. As far as words are concerned, people are very clever and
they can go on elaborating on these words, philosophizing. They can go
in deep subtleties; they can make very subtle distinctions, but their
consciousness remains unaffected.</p><p><br></p><p>A young nun arrived at the nunnery, panting and crying, “Mother,
Mother, something terrible has happened!”</p><p><br></p><p>“What is it, my daughter?” the Mother Superior asked, concerned.</p><p>“A maniac, Mother – a sex maniac raped me!” “Ah no, daughter, ah no!
When did it happen?” “Yesterday, the day before, and again today!”</p><p>You can impose character on people, but you cannot imagine
consciousness. Consciousness has to be discovered. These people can even
reach to heaven, but they will create a heaven of their own, they will
live in a world of their own. They will repeat the same kind of world
there. If these people – these Hindus, Mohammedans, Christians, these
monks and nuns and these mahatmas and saints, Catholics and Protestants
– if these are the people who are going to heaven, heaven cannot be any
different from this earth. The same crusades, the same wars, all kinds
of stupidities will go on, will continue. It will be only a repetition,
maybe on a wider scale, bigger scale, more sophisticated, but it cannot
be qualitatively different.</p><p><br></p><p>Young Barrington-Smythe had just reached the Pearly Gates. St. Peter
was welcoming him and telling him about the social life of heaven. “We
play a lot of sport here, young fellow me lad” said St. Peter. “On
Mondays and Thursdays it is polo, and Tuesdays and Fridays cricket.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, actually, sir,” answered the young man, “I don’t enjoy sport
very much.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, then perhaps you will enjoy Wednesday nights,” suggested St.
Peter. “There is a big dinner. After the meal when the port has been
passed around a few times, we really let our hair down, I can tell
you!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Actually, sir, I don’t enjoy drinking,” replied the young man.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah,” said St. Peter. Then after a short silence he suggested, “Then
you will enjoy Saturday nights. We have a dance with a lot of the young
ladies from hereabouts. Plenty of goings-on, if you know what I
mean!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Actually, sir,” said the young man again, “I don’t really enjoy the
company of young ladies.”</p><p><br></p><p>After a long pause St. Peter asked, “Barrington-Smythe, you are not a
homosexual by any chance?” “Oh no sir!”</p><p>“Pity,” said St. Peter, “you won’t enjoy Sunday nights either!”</p><p><br></p><p>The same people will be transported to heaven, to paradise; it is not
going to be any different at all. The question is not of going to
heaven, the question is not at all of finding God. The question is
knowing “Who am l?” From there real evolution starts – only from there
and from nowhere else.</p><p><br></p><p>Zen is the most beautiful method ever discovered to enter into the
innermost core of your being. It does not believe in character, it only
believes in consciousness. By changing your consciousness, your
character is changed automatically, but by changing your character your
consciousness is not changed in the same way. In fact, your
consciousness becomes repressed if you change your</p><p>character. There is created thereby a duality, a split. Your
consciousness remains of one type, your character of another type, and
they become unbridged. You become two persons or many, even. You become
polypsychic you become a crowd. Rather than coming to a rest, rather
than coming to deep silence, rather than experiencing peace, you become
more neurotic, more noisy. You lose all inner harmony, all accord.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what happens to the so-called moralists: they simply go on
doing a patchwork from the outside; they go on whitewashing people.
Jesus has called this whitewashing ‘whitewashing the graves’. Inside is
a stinking corpse and outside you have whitewashed it. From the outside
the grave looks beautiful; you can even put roses on it, you can grow
flowers on the grave, grass. You can make it look beautiful, but inside
it is just a grave.</p><p><br></p><p>And that is the situation of man. And the whole thing has happened
because we have believed too much in character. We may know, we may not
know. Ninety-nine point nine percent people of the world are
behaviorists – whatsoever they say does not matter. If you look deep
down they belong to the school of Pavlov and Skinner; they all believe
in behaviorism. They all believe that your behavior can be changed, then
you are changed because you are nothing but your behavior. They may not
say so, they may not even be aware of their fundamental belief, but
that’s how society has lived up to now. This society is not
religious.</p><p><br></p><p>Religious man has yet to arrive, a religious society has yet to
happen, a religious culture is yet in the future – on the horizon, but
we have to bring it; it has not happened. It has happened in few
individual cases here and there, but those people can be counted on
fingers.</p><p><br></p><p>This is a tremendously beautiful story. Go into it very meditatively
because each statement contains great treasures.</p><p><br></p><p>ZEN MASTER SHEN TSAN GAINED HIS ENLIGHTENMENT THROUGH PAI CHANG.</p><p><br></p><p>THE FIRST THING is to know the difference between a Master and a
teacher. Zen makes a very clearcut distinction: the teacher is one who
teaches you; he may not have known himself but he has studied. He is a
scholar, he knows the scriptures. He can help you to enter into the
world of books; he can introduce you into the intricacies of
philosophies, ideologies, doctrines. He can give you education,
information, but he cannot bring a transformation to you.</p><p><br></p><p>The Master is one who brings transformation to your being, who helps
you to find out your own light. The work of the teacher is direct; he
simply transfers whatsoever he knows to you. Knowledge is transferable,
wisdom is not transferable. Hence the work of the Master is indirect, it
can never be direct. The Master functions like a catalytic agent – his
presence helps. It is like the sun rising in the morning, and the birds
start singing. They are awake, flying around, enjoying the new day,
welcoming the new day with songs. The sun has not done anything directly
to them, but something has happened; a milieu has been created by the
sun in which the birds are feeling fresh, young, alive. The flowers
start opening. The sun is not coming to each flower and forcing it to
open – not in that direct way, but its rays are dancing around the
flower. It is giving warmth to the flower, it is encouraging the flower,
but in a very delicate way. Flowers have to be tackled in a delicate
way; if you force their petals to open you will destroy them. You may be
able to open them, but in the very opening you would have killed them;
they will not be alive. The sun simply creates a climate</p><p>in which they can open, in which they feel like opening. An inner
feel arises in them; some inner instinct synchronizes with the warmth of
the sun. And the flowers open and they start exuding their
fragrance.</p><p><br></p><p>Exactly is the work of the Master. He cannot hand you over what he
knows, but he can create a certain energy field in which your petals can
open up, in which your seeds can be encouraged, in which you can gather
courage enough to take the jump, in which a quantum leap becomes
possible.</p><p><br></p><p>Hence, enlightenment is not a direct work of the Master. It happens
through him, through his grace but not by him.</p><p><br></p><p>ZEN MASTER SHEN TSAN GAINED HIS ENLIGHTENMENT THROUGH PAI CHANG.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember the word through – not by.</p><p><br></p><p>HE THEN RETURNED TO THE MONASTERY IN WHICH HE HAD BEEN ORDAINED BY
HIS “FIRST TEACHER”...</p><p><br></p><p>Note the difference. Pai Chang is called “Master”, Shen Tsan is
called “Master”, but his old teacher is not called “Master”, only
“teacher”, because he ordained him only into the world of the
scriptures, theories – beautiful theories but all empty, with no
content.</p><p><br></p><p>This was THE MONK WHO HAD BROUGHT HIM UP FROM CHILDHOOD AND WHO, AT
THAT TIME, WAS A VERY OLD MAN.</p><p><br></p><p>ONE DAY SHEN TSAN WAS HELPING HIS OLD TEACHER TO BATHE. WHILE WASHING
THE OLD MAN S BACK, HE SAID TO HIM, “THIS IS SUCH A FINE TEMPLE, BUT THE
BUDDHA IN IT IS NOT AT ALL HOLY!”</p><p><br></p><p>The word “holy” is never used by Zen people in the Christian or the
Hindu sense. It is not used in the sense of sacred because for Zen there
is nothing sacred and nothing mundane. “Holy” is used in its literal
sense of wholeness. One who is whole is holy, one who lives a life of
totality is holy. One who lives in a fragmentary way, halfheartedly,
divided, wavering, disintegrated, is unholy. It has nothing to do with
purity or impurity, remember. It has nothing to do with virtue or sin,
remember. The Zen use of the word “holy” simply means one who is whole,
one who lives each moment in totality. Whatsoever he is doing he is
doing totally. If he is eating he is eating in a holy way; if he is
sleeping he is sleeping in a holy way. If he is talking he is talking in
a holy way. If he is listening he is listening in a holy way. Whatsoever
is the act, his consciousness is totally involved in it, committed to
it. He is passionately present in his actions. If he is silent then he
is really silent, not only on the surface. You can go on digging deeper
and deeper into him, but you will find only silence and silence, layer
upon layer. As you go deeper you will find thicker layers of silence.
When you reach at the very core you will find nothing but silence. His
taste is the same.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha used to say, “The holy man tastes the same, just like the
ocean. You can taste it from anywhere – from this shore or that, from
the shore or from the middle – it is always salty. So is the holy
man.”</p><p><br></p><p>The holy man lives not holding back; whatsoever he is doing he goes
totally into it.</p><p>Shen Tsan was giving a bath to his old teacher. Rubbing his back, he
said: “THIS IS SUCH A FINE TEMPLE...”</p><p>Every body is a fine temple, according to Zen. Every body is a shrine
of God; God is enshrined in everyone. You need not go anywhere else to
find God; if you can find yourself you have found God. He is hiding
within you – he is your within.</p><p><br></p><p>“THIS IS SUCH A FINE TEMPLE,” SHEN TSAN SAID, “BUT THE BUDDHA IN IT
IS NOT AT ALL HOLY!”</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe the old teacher was taking a bath and also reciting a sutra.
That’s what Buddhist monks do; they will go on taking a bath and
reciting a sutra. Hindu pundits do the same, Hindu sannyasins do the
same. They will go to take a dip in the Ganges and they will recite
gayatri and other mantras. They are divided! If you want to recite
gayatri, recite gayatri – forget about taking a bath. And when you are
taking a bath, take the bath, forget about gayatri. Then let this bath
be your only mantra.</p><p><br></p><p>He must have been reciting some mantra because they think, “Why waste
time? You can do both the things.” They will go on eating and they will
go on reciting inside a certain sacred mantra. Why waste time? But then
you are missing the totality of eating, then you are not tasting your
food. How can you do it? The mind is capable of doing only one thing at
a time; it cannot do two things together – it is impossible. If you are
eating, then let your whole consciousness be that of taste, of smell.
Forget everything! Then even ordinary bread may taste like the most
delicious food possible. But you are not present.</p><p><br></p><p>Look at people eating – they are talking, there are people who are
listening to the radio or seeing to the TV. I have heard about stupid
Americans even making love while seeing the TV! – what to say about
eating? Why miss? You can do both the things – you can make love and you
can go on seeing the TV. Now, neither you will be seeing the TV nor you
will be making love; you will not be able to enjoy either, you will miss
both. There are people who cannot eat if they don’t have company to talk
and gossip and to discuss. When you are talking you go on swallowing –
swallowing is not eating.</p><p><br></p><p>Eating should be meditative, prayerful. You should be more respectful
to food because it is life, it is nourishment. And then thousand and one
problems arise out of it. Because while you are eating you are reading
the newspaper or quarreling with the wife or listening to the radio or
looking at the TV or talking to a friend or holding the phone, you will
miss the joy of eating. You will eat more because your taste buds will
not feel fulfilled and contented. Then you will gather unnecessary fat
in the body. Then one has to start dieting, fasting, naturopathy and all
kinds of nonsense follow. But the simple thing that should have been
done in the first place was: just eating and not doing anything
else.</p><p><br></p><p>When Lin Chi was asked, “What is your meditation?” he said, “When I
eat I simply eat, and when I sleep I simply sleep. When I walk I simply
walk.”</p><p><br></p><p>The person who was asking said, “But this is what we all do.”</p><p><br></p><p>Lin Chi said, “No, that’s not what you do. When you are eating you go
on doing thousand and one other things too. I know it because I had been
just like you before I became enlightened. I had lived</p><p>in the same mad and stupid way, so I know how you are living. Don’t
say to me that this is what everybody does.”</p><p><br></p><p>The most stupid thing in life is to live halfheartedly, because the
moment that is gone is gone forever. But people are living so
unconsciously that it is almost impossible for them to be conscious of
what they are doing.</p><p><br></p><p>A guy was coming home from work to his house in a suburban
residential neighborhood of a typical American city. The houses were in
a large compound surrounded by beautiful lawns. While he was walking, a
tremendous bellyache gripped him. It was already dark and there were
three more blocks to go, so he decided to relieve his bellyache under
the bush next to a nearby house. He finished, stood up, closed his pants
and took a look to see his work. What a surprise! There was nothing. The
grass was clean, very clean. Just to make sure he lit his cigarette
lighter but there was nothing there, so very puzzled he went home.</p><p><br></p><p>That night he could not sleep for thinking about the mystery of the
disappearing shit and when he found his lighter missing the next day he
went back to the garden. He found the lighter but no trace of the
shit.</p><p><br></p><p>Straightening up, his eyes met those of an offended old lady. “Ah!”
she cried. “So you are the one who shit on my turtle!”</p><p><br></p><p>If you watch your life you will see what you go on doing. And it is
not only so about the ordinary people, but the people you call very
extraordinary, the geniuses; they are also as unconscious as you are, or
even more so.</p><p><br></p><p>It is said about Karl Marx, the founder of communism, that one day
studying in the British Museum he for the first time came across the
theory that if you drink or you smoke, or you use anything, you can save
money by using it more. For example, if you are smoking a cigarette of a
very costly brand and you start using a cheaper cigarette, on each
cigarette you will be saving money; the more cigarettes you smoke, the
more money will be saved. He was thrilled.</p><p><br></p><p>He went to the marketplace – he was a chain-smoker – he purchased the
cheapest kind of cigarette, as many as he could carry to the house. His
wife could not believe her eyes: “So many packets he is bringing – is he
going to open a shop or something?” She asked, “What is the matter?”</p><p><br></p><p>And he was so joyous, he said, “Wait! Now there is no need to work.
We can save money only by smoking more and more. You also start smoking,
and don’t stop children either from smoking. And whosoever comes to the
home, let them smoke as much as we smoke – more money will be saved. On
each cigarette so much money is going to be saved!” And he closed the
doors and started smoking.</p><p><br></p><p>The wife thought, “He has gone crazy How you can save money if you go
on smoking, just smoking?” She called his friend, Friedrich Engels, who
tried hard to argue with him that, “You are being foolish!” It took
hours for him to convince him that “This is nonsense! You will die of
cancer or some dangerous disease – and money will not be saved! The
theory is correct only if you smoke twelve cigarettes of a costly brand
and twelve cigarettes of cheap brand; then you will be saving money. But
that does not mean you go on smoking cigarettes day and night and then
there is no need to work.”</p><p>Now people like Karl Marx, who are thought to be very logical, can
behave in a very unconscious way.</p><p><br></p><p>One day it happened:</p><p><br></p><p>Edison was writing some letters. His wife came, and she knew that he
never likes to be disturbed in the middle of his work because sometimes
he loses track of his theory. She had brought his breakfast, so she kept
the breakfast by the side and went away to do some other work.</p><p><br></p><p>Meanwhile a friend came. Seeing the breakfast is getting cold and he
is so much in his writing, just to play a joke on him he ate the
breakfast. When he finished the letter he looked around. He saw the
empty plate he said to the friend, “Sorry, you came a little late – I
have finished my breakfast.” Seeing the plate empty he thought he must
have finished, he must have eaten the breakfast.</p><p><br></p><p>Not even the ordinary people, but your so-called geniuses... Edison
is one the greatest talented persons ever: he discovered one thousand
things – one thousand things is a rare achievement – but remained his
whole life unconscious, so much so that once he forgot his own name.</p><p><br></p><p>It is said of Immanuel Kant, a great German philosopher, that he had
to be reminded of every small thing he lived such an unconscious life.
Each small thing had to be reminded to him, even things like this:</p><p><br></p><p>One day he came home after his evening walk, stood in the comer of
the room, laid down his walking-stick on the bed thinking that he is
lying on the bed and the walking-stick is standing in the comer of the
room. The servant, seeing the light on, looked through the keyhole, was
puzzled – what is happening? – because he saw Immanuel Kant standing in
the corner of the room and the stick lying down on the bed. He knocked
on the door.</p><p><br></p><p>Immanuel Kant opened the door and the servant asked, “What is the
matter? What are you doing?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I also am feeling a little bit strange. Something is wrong,
but I am not exactly certain what it is. I am feeling very tired!”</p><p><br></p><p>Every man has a Buddha inside him, but the Buddha is not holy, is not
whole. We are living in fragments. Somebody is living in his head,
somebody is living in his body, somebody is living somewhere else.
Somebody is focused on the money, somebody on power, somebody on some
other trip, some other number. But nobody is wholly, fully aware what he
is doing, what he is being.</p><p><br></p><p>“THIS IS SUCH A FINE TEMPLE,” SHEN TSAN SAID, “BUT THE BUDDHA IN IT
IS NOT AT ALL HOLY!” HIS OLD TEACHER TURNED ROUND AND LOOKED AT HIM,
WHEREUPON SHEN TSAN COMMENTED, “THOUGH THE BUDDHA IS NOT HOLY, HE CAN
STILL RADIATE THE LIGHT.”</p><p><br></p><p>In that moment when the old teacher looked back – shocked in a way,
because what Shen Tsan had said was very shocking, in a way rude from a
disciple, saying that he is not holy! – in that shock his mind must have
stopped. And looking at Shen Tsan for a moment he must have been in a
state of no-mind – just for a moment. And that is the moment when you
start radiating the Buddha.</p><p>... SHEN TSAN COMMENTED, “THOUGH THE BUDDHA IS NOT HOLY, HE CAN STILL
RADIATE THE LIGHT.”</p><p><br></p><p>Once in a while... so if he can radiate the light once in a while he
can radiate the light forever. It is only a question of little more
awareness.</p><p><br></p><p>AGAIN, ONE DAY, WHILE THE OLD MAN WAS READING A SUTRA NEAR A
PAPER-COVERED WINDOW, A BEE TRIED DESPERATELY, WITH ALL ITS STRENGTH, TO
FLY OUT OF THE ROOM THROUGH THE PAPER BUT WAS UNABLE TO GET THROUGH.</p><p><br></p><p>BEES SEEM TO HAVE something like human minds, exactly the same kind
of stupidity. The doors may be open, but if a bee is inside the room,
caught inside the room... and she may have come from the open door but
she will try to get out from the closed window. Not only bees but other
birds also behave in the same way. Any bird can enter in your room; the
doors are open, he has come from the door, but he cannot go back from
the same door. He starts trying to get through the wall, through the
ceiling... and the more he tries, the more desperate he becomes, because
there is no way to get through the ceiling or through the wall or
through the closed window. And in that desperation, frustration he
becomes more and more blind, afraid, scared. He loses all intelligence.
And the same is the case with human beings.</p><p><br></p><p>One day Buddha came into his assembly of the monks. It must have been
just a morning like this. His sannyasins were sitting and waiting for
him. They were puzzled because this was for the first time that Buddha
had come with something in his hand – a handkerchief. They all looked at
the handkerchief What was the matter? There must be something special in
it. And Buddha sat on the platform and rather than starting speaking to
the assembly he looked at the handkerchief, started tying a few knots in
it, five knots in all. The whole assembly watched – what is going
on?</p><p><br></p><p>And then he asked the assembly, “Can anybody tell me: is this
handkerchief the same as it was before the knots were tied?”</p><p><br></p><p>Sariputta said, “This is a tricky question. In a way the handkerchief
is the same because nothing has changed, in a way it is not the same
because these five knots have appeared which were not there before. But
as far as the inner nature of the handkerchief is concerned – its nature
is concerned – it is the same; but as far as its form is concerned it is
no more the same. The form has changed: the substance is the same.”</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha said, “Right. Now I want to open these knots.” And he started
stretching both ends of the handkerchief farther away from each other.
He asked Sariputta. “What do you think? By stretching farther will I be
able to open the knots?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “You will be making knots even more difficult to open
because they will become smaller, more tighter. ’</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha said, “Right. Then I want to ask the last question: what
should I do so that I can open the knots, the tied knots? How I can
untie them again?”</p><p><br></p><p>Sariputta said, “Bhagwan, I would like first to come close and see
how in the first place the knots have been tied. Unless I know how they
have been tied it is difficult for me to suggest any solution.”</p><p>Buddha said, “Right, Sariputta. You are blessed, because that is the
most fundamental question to ask. If you are in a certain fix, the first
thing is how you got into it rather than trying to get out of it.
Without asking the most fundamental and the primary question, you will
make things worse.”</p><p><br></p><p>And that’s what people are doing. They ask, “How we can get out of
our sexuality, greed, anger, attachment, jealousy, possessiveness, this
and that?” without asking, “How in the first place we get into
them?”</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha’s whole approach is, first see how you get into anger. If you
can see the entrance, the same door is the exit; no other door is
needed. But without knowing the entrance if you try to find out the exit
you are not going to find; you will get more and more desperate. And
that’s what people go on doing.</p><p><br></p><p>In the scriptures, what are you looking for? – solutions. You create
the problems – and the solutions are in the scriptures! Why don’t you
look at the problems yourself. How you create them? Why don’t you watch
when you are creating a certain problem? And you create every day, so it
is not a question that you have to go back. Today you are going to be
angry again, today you will feel again the sexual urge: see how it
arises, see how you enter into it, how you get hooked into it, how it
becomes so big like a cloud that surrounds you and you are lost in it.
And then you go to ask others!</p><p><br></p><p>You are functioning almost like a stupid bee. Bees can be forgiven,
but you cannot be forgiven.</p><p><br></p><p>Shen Tsan is using all opportunities to make his old teacher aware
what has happened to him. He does not want to say directly because it
cannot be said directly. It will be too impolite to say directly that,
“I have become enlightened.” That may hinder rather than help; the old
teacher’s ego may be hurt. And enlightenment cannot be claimed; you have
to produce proofs of it. You have to be very seductive about it, and
that’s what he is doing. He is being very seductive; he is throwing here
and there a few remarks just like arrows, hitting from every direction
in the very heart of the old teacher, to make him aware that Shen Tsan
is not the same person as he had left him. A totally new being has come
to him, a new consciousness is born into him. He is reborn.</p><p><br></p><p>... WHILE THE OLD MAN WAS READING A SUTRA...</p><p><br></p><p>Now he has become old, but is still reading a sutra. Sutras are good
when you are children, sutras are good when you are young, but there is
a time when you should become mature enough to go beyond information and
start looking for transformation. Now this man is getting so old; still
with trembling hands he must be holding an ancient sutra, still looking
for some exit.</p><p><br></p><p>And the beautiful opportunity arose because a bee entered into the
room. Now the bee has entered from the open door. From where it will
enter? How have you entered into the world? How you enter every day when
you get up in the morning into the world again?</p><p><br></p><p>Have you ever watched? – when for the first moment you become aware
in the morning that sleep has left, there is a gap of a few seconds in
which the mind does not exist – only a few seconds. Sleep is no more and
the world has not started yet. The mind will take a little time to
start. There is a gap, an interval, a few seconds. If you are alert
enough you will be able to see how you enter every day into the world.
What is your first thought? Can you say what was your first thought
today? You must have entered, but you are not aware at all.</p><p>We live so mechanically. Each moment is an opportunity, but we go on
losing it in our stupidity.</p><p><br></p><p>... THE BEE TRIED DESPERATELY WITH ALL ITS STRENGTH... WITH ALL ITS
WILLPOWER... TO FLY OUT OF THE ROOM THROUGH THE PAPER.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what the yogis, the so-called ascetics are trying to do with
all their will, with all their effort, endeavor, with all their
strength. They are trying to get through the wall rather than sitting
silently, becoming calm and quiet, looking around for the door from
where they have entered in.</p><p><br></p><p>The most important thing whenever you are in a problem is not to
start immediately doing something, otherwise you will make the problem
worse. The most significant thing is for the time being not to do
anything at all. Just sit silently, relax, rest, be in a let-go. Rather
than trying to find out the way, watch from where you have entered,
because each problem has its own solution and each question has its own
answer in it. If you are careful enough, conscious enough, you will be
able to find it there, and nowhere else you can find it. No scriptures
are going to help.</p><p><br></p><p>THE BEE WAS TRYING, WITH ALL ITS STRENGTH, TO FLY OUT OF THE ROOM
THROUGH THE PAPER BUT WAS UNABLE TO GET THROUGH. SHEN TSAN, SEEING THIS,
SAID, “THE WORLD IS SO VAST AND WIDE THAT YOU MAY EASILY SET YOURSELF
FREE IN IT. WHY, THEN, DO YOU FOOLISHLY BORE INTO OLD, ROTTEN
PAPER?”</p><p><br></p><p>Now this was too much! The Master is reading some old scripture. And
older the scripture is, people think, the better it is; the more rotten,
the more important they think; the more ancient, the more significant
they think.</p><p><br></p><p>Zen believes in burning the scriptures. The most famous Zen painting
is Bodhidharma burning scriptures, throwing them into fire. It does not
mean literally. There are fools...</p><p><br></p><p>I had a painting when I used to live in Jabalpur – a friend brought a
painting of Bodhidharma burning the scriptures. A young man used to come
to me; he saw the painting, he asked me the meaning. I told him the
meaning. He went home, he burned all his scriptures. And then he could
not sleep the whole night because he became very much disturbed. The
gods may become angry – what he has done?</p><p><br></p><p>Early in the morning, four o’clock, he knocked on my door. He said,
“Save me – I am getting mad! What you suggested I have done – I have
burned the scriptures. My mother is mad, my father is mad. My whole
family is thinking that I have to be put into a mental asylum because I
have burned the SRIMAD BHAGAVAD GITA, and they say this is the most
sacrilegious act. And they cannot believe and I tried to convince them
about you and about your ideas, and they said, ‘That man is mad and you
are mad!’ What am I supposed to do now? I could not sleep the whole
night. I myself am afraid. Krishna must have felt offended. Now how can
I be saved?”</p><p><br></p><p>I told him, “How many scriptures did you have?” He said, “I had the
RAMAYANA and the SRIMAD BHAGAVAD GITA and few others.”</p><p><br></p><p>I phoned to a bookseller and ordered those books and gave the young
man those books and I told him never to come to me again, “Because you
are not the person to come here – you are a fool!</p><p>That painting and whatsoever I had said was not to be taken
literally; it is a metaphor. It is significant as a metaphor. Yes, you
have to burn all the scriptures from your mind. Burning old, rotten
paper is not going to help. If it is not going to help by reading it,
how is it going to help by burning it? It is the same old rotten paper
whether you read it or you burn it.”</p><p><br></p><p>The Master must have felt something has to be done now, and as the
Master felt that his disciple is no more the same, Shen Tsan said this
beautiful sutra:</p><p><br></p><p>“WHILE THE EMPTY DOOR IS OPEN WIDE HOW FOOLISH IT IS TO TRY TO GET
OUT BY THRUSTING AGAINST THE WINDOW! ALAS! HOW CAN YOU, MASTER,</p><p>RAISE YOUR HEAD ABOVE THE SLOUGH</p><p><br></p><p>BY PUTTING YOUR NOSE AGAINST OLD, ROTTEN PAPER FOR A HUNDRED
YEARS?”</p><p>First he has said as if he was talking to the bee, now he has
directly said to the Master. Now he felt, “The time is ripe – now the
Master is ready to listen.”</p><p><br></p><p>HEARING THIS REMARK, THE OLD MAN LAID DOWN HIS BOOK AND SAID TO SHEN
TSAN, “FOR QUITE A FEW TIMES NOW, YOU HAVE MADE UNUSUAL REMARKS”</p><p><br></p><p>ONLY BUDDHAS can make unusual remarks; they are bound to make unusual
remarks. It is only through wisdom that the fire of rebellion arises.
Knowledge is conventional, pundits are traditional. Only the enlightened
people are the salt of the earth.</p><p><br></p><p>THE OLD TEACHER SAID, “FOR QUITE A FEW TIMES NOW, YOU HAVE MADE
UNUSUAL REMARKS. FROM WHOM DID YOU GAIN YOUR KNOWLEDGE WHILE YOU WERE
AWAY FROM HOME?”</p><p><br></p><p>SHEN TSAN REPLIED, “I HAVE REACHED THE STATE OF PEACEFUL REST...”</p><p><br></p><p>This was the time now, the right time. Everything has to be said at a
certain right time; if you say it when the time is not right it is
useless. Hence the Master has to wait, wait for the right season, for
the right climate, for the right moment. One never knows when it will
come, but when it comes, only then the awakening is possible.</p><p><br></p><p>SHEN TSAN REPLIED, “L HAVE REACHED THE STATE OF PEACEFUL REST... I
HAVE COME TO MY CENTER... THROUGH THE GRACE OF MASTER PAI CHANG”</p><p><br></p><p>Remember the word “grace”: not through the effort but through the
grace.</p><p>“NOW I HAVE COME BACK HOME TO PAY MY DEBT OF GRATITUDE TO YOU.</p><p><br></p><p>“And I have come back home because you had brought me up, you have
worked hard with me. Whatsoever you knew you have tried to impart to me.
Of course, you were not enlightened and you could not help me to become
enlightened, but without you perhaps I would not have been able to find
the right man, Pai Chang.”</p><p><br></p><p>And Pai Chang was a rare man. He was not a monk, he was not a
bhikkhu, a sannyasin, he lived the life of an ordinary, worldly man. He
remained a layman his whole life, even after he became enlightened. He
never stopped his ordinary activities. He had thousands of followers by
and by, many people gathered around him, but he continued to do his
usual work. Many people invited him, even the king, that “You need not
work any more – we can make a big monastery for you. You have so many
followers there is no need for you to work. You can help people.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I am helping. This is the only way I can help people. I
would like to remain in the marketplace.”</p><p><br></p><p>This old teacher may have been far more famous; he had many disciples
– Pai Chang was just a layman – but now was the right time to say to
him. First he may not have listened at all, may have felt offended, but
Shen Tsan said, “I had to come to you to pay my respects, my gratitude.
You have done much for me – you prepared me for Pai Chang.”</p><p><br></p><p>A real seeker always feels grateful, to everybody, whosoever has
helped him in any possible way. He feels grateful to his parents, he
feels grateful to all his teachers; he feels grateful even to people who
have deceived him, who were pseudo, who were not real teachers even, who
were cheaters. But he feels grateful even to them, because they all have
helped you – positively, negatively, in some way or other.</p><p><br></p><p>If you are here, you are here because of many many people, good and
bad both. And the day you become reborn, remember it, that you owe
something to everybody, whosoever has helped you in any way. The husband
who has divorced you, the wife who has left you and gone with somebody
else, the parents who abandoned you, who have forgotten all about you,
the many pseudo teachers who roam around the world exploiting people,
they all have helped in certain ways. When you will become enlightened
you will know how they all have helped. If the husband has not divorced
you you may not have been here at all – you may be still hanging with
the fool! You owe much gratefulness to him. The wife who left you and
went with somebody else, don’t carry any grudge against her; she has
done a great service to you, otherwise you may not have been here. She
may be still nagging you!</p><p><br></p><p>Everything that has happened has been good. Once you attain to the
ultimate rest it makes everything golden. Even nights, dark nights
become sources of the beautiful mornings, beautiful dawns.</p><p><br></p><p>THE OLD TEACHER THEN PREPARED A GREAT FESTIVAL IN HIS YOUNG
DISCIPLE’S HONOR, SUMMONED THE MONKS IN THE MONASTERY TO THE ASSEMBLY
HALL, AND BESOUGHT SHEN TSAN TO PREACH THE DHARMA TO ALL. WHEREUPON SHEN
TSAN ASCENDED TO THE HIGH SEAT AND, FOLLOWING THE TRADITION OF PAI
CHANG, PREACHED AS FOLLOWS...</p><p>THE OLD TEACHER understood it immediately, even though he was just
reading the scriptures, but must have been a man of insight and
understanding, not just a stupid scholar – a scholar, but searching for
something more, trying to transcend words and reach to the content. He
immediately recognized the light that had come to the face of his
disciple. He could see the radiance, he could feel the fragrance. And
then he was not miserly in any way. He respected him, arranged for a
great festival, a great ceremony in his honor, called the whole
assembly, all his students and disciples, and asked him to ascend and
preach the dharma to all.</p><p><br></p><p>WHEREUPON SHEN TSAN ASCENDED TO THE HIGH SEAT...</p><p><br></p><p>and spoke these few, but they are tremendously beautiful:</p><p><br></p><p>“SINGULARLY RADIATING IS THE WONDROUS LIGHT</p><p><br></p><p>FREE FROM THE BONDAGE OF MATTER AND THE SENSES.”</p><p><br></p><p>If you become conscious you immediately know that you are not the
body nor the mind; you are pure consciousness, and that pure
consciousness is the wondrous light. That is the light Buddha has said
about: “Be a light unto yourself.”</p><p><br></p><p>“NOT BINDING BY WORDS AND LETTERS...”</p><p><br></p><p>It is not confined to any words or any letters. It is beyond all
descriptions, beyond all expression, beyond all definitions.</p><p><br></p><p>“THE ESSENCE IS NAKEDLY EXPOSED IN ITS PURE ETERNITY.”</p><p><br></p><p>But if you have eyes to see, if you have intelligence it is available
in all its nakedness, in all its eternal purity, in its absolute,
essential beauty it is available. Every moment is available; just it is
because of your stupidity, your mediocrity, your mind, that it remains
hidden. It is not hidden; your consciousness is clouded.</p><p><br></p><p>“NEVER DEFILED IS THE MIND-NATURE...”</p><p><br></p><p>And remember, whatsoever you do, whatsoever you have done, you cannot
defile your innermost core. Your center remains unaffected by the
circumference, your consciousness remains unaffected by your character.
The cyclone cannot touch the center. You are the center of the
cyclone.</p><p><br></p><p>“IT EXISTS IN PERFECTION FROM THE VERY BEGINNING.”</p><p><br></p><p>And you are not to attain to perfection. This is the Zen discovery:
that you are not to attain it, it is already the case. You are perfect
from the very beginning.</p><p><br></p><p>“BY MERELY CASTING AWAY YOUR DELUSIONS...”</p><p>All that is needed is just cast away your delusions. “THE SUCHNESS OF
BUDDHAHOOD IS REALIZED.”</p><p>And immediately you realize you have been the Buddha since the
beginning. You have always been the Buddha and nobody else. You have
been a god from the very beginning, you cannot be otherwise. Godliness
is your intrinsic essence, it is nothing to be achieved. And it is
impossible to defile it – no karma can defile it.</p><p><br></p><p>So whatsoever you have done you have done only in your dreams. When
you wake up, whether you dreamed of being a sinner or being a saint does
not matter. When you wake up, both the dreams are finished; you don’t
bother at all. You don’t feel guilty that you have been a sinner in your
dreams and you don’t feel “holier-than-thou” because you have been a
saint in your dreams. Dreams are dreams, illusions. The awakened person
is freed from all dreams.</p><p><br></p><p>“THE SUCHNESS OF BUDDHAHOOD IS REALIZED.”</p><p><br></p><p>You are Buddhas right now, this very moment!</p><p><br></p><p>AS SOON AS THE OLD TEACHER HEARD THIS STANZA, HE WAS IMMEDIATELY
AWAKENED.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the lion’s roar: You are Buddhas this very moment, right now!
Nothing has to be attained, nothing has to be changed. Wake up!
Listening to this lion’s roar, the old teacher immediately became
awakened. All that is needed is intelligence, all that is needed is
understanding the point, a capacity to be available to the Master.</p><p><br></p><p>This old man must have been rare. It must be said about him that he
was able even to receive the message from his own disciple. He must have
been a humble man; he must have been able to put his ego aside. And that
is the greatest delusion. He immediately became awakened.</p><p><br></p><p>In Zen this is called the special transmission: the transmission
beyond words, beyond scriptures. What is said is not the real thing, but
what was heard was the real thing. What is said, you have heard it; but
what the old man heard you have not yet heard. The day you hear it you
will know what it is: the special transmission.</p><p><br></p><p>It is like when you bring an unlit candle close to a lit candle.
Suddenly from the lit candle the flame jumps to the unlit candle. The
lit candle loses nothing and the unlit candle gains everything. This is
the special transmission – beyond words, beyond scriptures.</p><p><br></p><p>In that moment when Shen Tsan shouted:</p><p><br></p><p>“BY MERELY CASTING AWAY YOUR DELUSIONS THE SUCHNESS OF BUDDHAHOOD IS
REALIZED</p><p>“... and your self-nature is never defiled, and you are perfect from
the very beginning,” the old man immediately became awakened Just like
sudden lightning... and all darkness has disappeared and disappeared
forever. In fact, it never existed in the first place; you were simply
imagining it.</p><p><br></p><p>All misery is in your imagination. When this imaginary misery is
dropped there is nothing left but bliss, benediction, ecstasy.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part2>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

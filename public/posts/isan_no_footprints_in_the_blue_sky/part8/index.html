ISAN SAID TO HIM, “YOU ARE NOW CALLED A GOOD AND CLEVER TEACHER. HOW CAN YOU DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THOSE WHO COME FROM ALL PARTS AND KNOW IT, AND THOSE WHO DON’T KNOW IT; THE MASTERS WHO HAVE INHERITED IT, AND THOSE WHO HAVE NOT; THE PROFOUND LEARNING, AND THE MEANING LEARNING? EXPLAIN AND LET ME HEAR.”\nKYOZAN REPLIED, “KYOZAN HAS HAD THIS EXPERIENCE. WHEN MONKS COME FROM ALL DIRECTIONS, HE RAISES HIS STICK, AND ASKS THEM IF THIS IS EXPOUNDED WHERE THEY COME FROM OR NOT. FURTHER, HE SAYS TO THEM, LEAVING THIS ASIDE, ‘WHAT ARE THE OLD MASTERS WHERE YOU COME FROM TEACHING?’”\nISAN ADMIRED HIM AND SAID, “THIS HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE CLAW AND FANG OF OUR SECT.”\nManeesha, the silence here is so dense, one feels a little afraid even to utter a word. It may disturb the silent lake of your consciousness. But always remember that in the wake of words, silence is deepened. The higher the mountain, the greater will be the valley surrounding it. A great mountain cannot have a small valley. There is a tremendous balance in everything as far as nature is concerned.\nThe essential Zen is an effort to bring you to the language of existence that you have forgotten completely. You have forgotten completely the most important, and you are filled in your mind with all kinds of gibberish.\nYou may know, you may not know, that gibberish is not an English word. It comes from Persia, the old name of Iran, and it comes from a very mystical person, Jabbar, because he never spoke anything relevant. Not only was it irrelevant, there was no grammar, there were no words at all, but only sounds. Because of Jabbar, the name ‘gibberish’ came into existence.\nBut Jabbar was saying something through his gibberish. He was saying, “All that we can say about existence is gibberish.” He was very much in tune with existence.\nIt seems unbelievable that he had one thousand disciples. Sitting by his side, when he was silent they would be silent; when he would go into gibberish, they would go into gibberish – and nearabout twenty-five people became enlightened. Not a word was said by Jabbar, nothing was heard by anybody.\nYou cannot write a treatise on Jabbar because he never spoke anything except gibberish. But he was a radiant man, a man who had come to flowering, whose spring had come, and who was not afraid to be vulnerable and open and receptive. He went along with the wind.\nZen has done the same from a different angle, but you must be aware of the fact that any authentic master – to whatever age, to whatever country he belongs – is not interested in preaching you a doctrine. His interest is to bring you in communion, in balance with the reality that surrounds you.\nZen has used many methods never known before. You cannot conceive in a Greek context the validity of any method of Zen. Even Socrates and Plato would have been at a loss if they had met Bodhidharma or Jabbar.\nI always think what a hilarious meeting it would be: Jabbar meeting Socrates. Socrates was so logical, so rational. His honesty was exactly the same as Jabbar’s; he was ready to risk his life for his truth, but still he did not rise, until the last moment of his life, to enlightenment. The day he dropped all knowledge, all wisdom, the day he dropped language as such, that very moment a tremendous silence descended upon him. And those of you who are slowly slowly moving towards the great experience will become aware of it – not because I say so, but because you experience it so.\nHow can you say anything about the tremendous silence that is here now? Our minds are preventing us... our minds are taking us away from the very center of our being. The mind is not interested at all in an interior exploration. It is absolutely committed to the outside and the objective.\nBefore I talk about Isan’s sutra... because this sutra will be the last of this series and also this sutra is the last of Isan’s life. This sutra ends exactly at the time Isan dies.\nThe death of a person indicates how he has lived, whether he has lived at all or not. You may be believing that you are living, but don’t be so certain.\nEvery madman in all the madhouses in the world believes absolutely that he is not mad. He wonders why people consider him to be mad. Slowly slowly he comes to the conclusion that the world is mad: “Poor fellows, they cannot understand my state.”\nA man who had been crazy all his life went beyond the boundary. Small trips beyond the mind can be tolerated, but he went a little too far; he started saying that “I am dead.”\nEverybody laughed, everybody said, “This is too much. You have already been doing great things.… And how can you be dead? – you are speaking!”\nHe said, “So what? Dead people speak.”\nThey told him, “You are walking, you are eating, you are sleeping.”\nHe said, “That does not prove that I am alive. That simply proves that I am vegetating. But as far as my deadness is concerned... I am absolutely certain.”\nThey took the man finally to a psychoanalyst. The psychoanalyst said to the family, “Don’t be worried. It will take a little time. You leave him with me. He has to come for a one hour session twice a week.”\nAll this time, the madman who had now become dead was smiling.\nThe first question the psychoanalyst asked him was, “Why are you smiling?”\nHe said, “Strange... a single man is alive amongst a group who are all dead. But just to convince themselves that they are alive, they are trying to convince me that ‘You are also alive’ – and I have never seen anything living in me.”\nThe psychoanalyst was at a loss himself, because this was an absolutely new case. He had never dealt with dead people, but he figured out a way. He took a knife and cut the madman’s finger. Blood started coming out. The psychoanalyst said, “Have you ever heard that dead men don’t bleed?”\nThe man said, “Yes. While I was alive I heard this saying.”\nThe psychoanalyst felt great pride, but the madman said, “Don’t be proud. It does not prove that I am not dead. It only proves that the proverb is wrong. Dead men do bleed. I am an example, a living example!”\nAfter two, three sessions, the psychoanalyst was continuously thinking about the man. And slowly slowly a doubt started arising in him, “If somebody asks me to prove it, how am I going to prove that I am alive?”\nThat night he could not sleep. Next day was his session. He said to the man, “I will not charge you anything, but please leave me alone. You can find some other psychoanalyst – they are a rupee a dozen – because I am becoming suspicious about my own life. Rather than convincing you that you are dead, you are by and by convincing me that who knows? – I may have died! Perhaps I am dreaming that I am alive.”\nWhat proof have you that you are not dreaming?\nDeath is the criterion in the tradition of Zen. How a man dies proves whether he has lived or not. Only a living man can die; you cannot afford to die if you have not lived.\nI have heard about a great scholar. He became aware that he was alive only when he was dead. Then suddenly he realized, “My God! I used to be alive, and I never took any notice of it.”\nParticularly in Zen, the masters show the highest peaks of consciousness. Death is the criterion. If you can die gracefully, blissfully, almost dancingly, that proves that you have lived, and you have lived so deeply that you know that death is only the changing of the house.\nKYOZAN ONCE RETURNED TO ISAN TO INTERVIEW HIM.\nYou will be surprised... That is another speciality in Zen, that disciples come to interview the master – nowhere else. But Zen is very playful. Its playfulness is so deep that it takes nothing seriously.\nKYOZAN ONCE RETURNED TO ISAN TO INTERVIEW HIM. ISAN SAID TO HIM, “YOU ARE NOW CALLED A GOOD AND CLEVER TEACHER. HOW CAN YOU DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THOSE WHO COME FROM ALL PARTS AND KNOW IT, AND THOSE WHO DON’T KNOW IT; THE MASTERS WHO HAVE INHERITED IT, AND THOSE WHO HAVE NOT; THE PROFOUND LEARNING, AND THE MEANING LEARNING. EXPLAIN AND LET ME HEAR.”\nKYOZAN REPLIED, “KYOZAN HAS HAD THIS EXPERIENCE. WHEN MONKS COME FROM ALL DIRECTIONS, HE RAISES HIS STICK, AND ASKS THEM IF THIS IS EXPOUNDED WHERE THEY COME FROM OR NOT. FURTHER, HE SAYS TO THEM, LEAVING THIS ASIDE, ‘WHAT ARE THE OLD MASTERS WHERE YOU COME FROM TEACHING?’”\nISAN ADMIRED HIM AND SAID, “THIS HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE CLAW AND FANG OF OUR SECT.”\nA few things to be noted.\nKyozan succeeded Isan. But to interview the master before he became enlightened shows his daringness, his courage. And it also shows the grace and greatness of Isan that he did not object to it: “You don’t know anything about it, and you are trying to interview me?”\nBut without saying it, if you look at the whole thing, it becomes just the opposite. It is an interview not of Isan by Kyozan, but an interview by Isan of Kyozan. He did not say anything to hurt him, he did not reject the interview or say that “You are not of the quality yet; you have not experienced your innermost core.” Rather than rejecting, Isan accepts it and starts the interview himself.\nKYOZAN REPLIED, “KYOZAN HAS HAD THIS EXPERIENCE...” because Isan has asked, “How do you teach people? And how do you know whether somebody knows or not? whether somebody is a master or only a pretender?” And Kyozan has forgotten completely that he has come to interview Isan, and he is being interviewed – the craftsmanship of a great master.\nKYOZAN REPLIED, “KYOZAN HAS HAD THIS EXPERIENCE. WHEN MONKS COME FROM ALL DIRECTIONS, HE RAISES HIS STICK, AND ASKS THEM IF THIS IS EXPOUNDED...”\nHe is not asking about the stick, he is raising the stick to indicate “thisness.” Are you coming from a master who has explained to you “thisness,” the present moment of splendor, the great moment of being nobody? – because a master never hits a disciple unless a disciple is really able to be awakened by a single hit.\nKyozan said, “WHEN MONKS COME FROM ALL DIRECTIONS, HE RAISES HIS STICK, AND ASKS THEM IF THIS IS EXPOUNDED WHERE THEY COME FROM OR NOT. FURTHER, HE SAYS TO THEM, LEAVING THIS ASIDE, ‘WHAT ARE THE OLD MASTERS WHERE YOU COME FROM TEACHING?’”\nIn fact, if you have found a master you have found your home; there is nowhere to go. Or wherever you go you will find your master and nobody else.\nWhen Gautam Buddha became enlightened his first words were strange: “Not only I am enlightened, the whole existence is enlightened with me. This music, this music of silence, soundless, these flowers, invisible, falling all over the place – I was just keeping my eyes closed. Today my eyes are open, but that does not make me superior. From the smallest blade of grass to the greatest star everything is in blissfulness.”\nMan has created only one thing: misery for himself and misery for others. We are great creators of misery. If someday nothing terrible happens to you, that day is wasted – something terrible so that you can talk about it, rejoice about it, some great tragedy. People don’t like to see comedies, people like to see tragedies.\nWhen there is a war going on, everybody gets up early in the morning to find the newspaper, what is happening. Everybody looks fresh; something terrible is happening, so many thousands of people are dying. We have become so accustomed to tragedy, and comedy seems to be tasteless.\nWhen you have found a master, you have found him. You can remain, you can go, but the master has settled in your heart.\nThose who go on and on are simply indicating that they have not found the man who makes your heart dance. They have not clicked with somebody. They have not found a man of presence who engulfs you with love and joy, compassion and light, life and love, beauty and truth, and all that is divine in existence. Unless you have seen those two eyes in which all that is divine reflects, you have to go on in the hope that somewhere you may find.\nBut remember always, because you can miss a real master, that you have to be absolutely receptive, utterly open, with no doors closed, with no windows closed. The fresh breeze comes with great fragrance, the coolness of it... the perfume of it is always available; just your doors were closed.\nSo if you don’t find a master, don’t think that there is no master. First, begin to see: Are you able to receive a master? Is your heart open? Is not your mind burdened with many kind of prejudices?\nWhat are all your religions except prejudices? No man of intelligence can depend on birth; birth is accidental. You are born a Hindu, that does not make you a Hindu. You are born a Mohammedan, that does not make you a Mohammedan. Such a great phenomenon as religion cannot be left\nhanging on the accidental phenomenon of birth. You have to choose it. You have to find it. Everybody has to go into deeper search.\nISAN ADMIRED HIM.…\nRemember, admiration is not the real appreciation of a master. If Isan had given him a good slap, or a good stick, that would have been appreciation.\nOur stickholder – because I am a lazy man, I cannot carry the stick – has come from Germany. Just show your stick and hit poor Maneesha! (NISKRIYA TAKES THE STICK AND TAPS MANEESHA ON THE HEAD. IT MAKES A LOUD, SHARP CLICK.)\nGood!\nISAN ADMIRED HIM AND SAID, “THIS HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE CLAW AND FANG OF OUR SECT.”\nSeeing that Kyozan would not understand, he is not yet ripe, Isan avoided the stick.\nISAN TAUGHT FOR OVER FORTY YEARS DURING WHICH TIME HE GATHERED INNUMERABLE DISCIPLES. ON FEBRUARY 20TH, 853, HE WENT THROUGH A RITUAL ABLUTION, SEATED HIMSELF IN THE MEDITATION POSTURE AND, SMILING, DIED AT THE AGE OF EIGHTY-THREE. HIS STUPA WAS ERECTED ON MOUNT KUEI, HOME OF HIS MONASTERY.\nTHE EMPEROR GAVE HIM THE POSTHUMOUS TITLE TA YUAN (GREAT PERFECTION).\nIsan must have worked hard in polishing an ordinary stone into a diamond. The whole glory and credit goes to Isan. He turned an ordinary man into a great perfection.\nKyozan does not show much insight, intelligence, meditativeness, but it is the compassion of the master to do his best. Forty years he worked on Kyozan. It is a long time, but for compassion neither time means anything nor space means anything. Isan succeeded in bringing him home.\nI am reminded of a great emperor who dreamed one night that a great black shadow was standing before him. With trembling hands and throbbing heart, he asked, “Who are you?”\nThe shadow said, “That we will discuss later on. I have come to inform you that tomorrow evening as the sun will be setting you will die.” And the shadow disappeared, and with the shadow the sleep also disappeared.\nThe king was perspiring. He called the attendant. In the middle of the night all the astrologers, palmists, prophets were called to interpret the dream: What does it mean?\nThey started looking in their great scriptures, “Is there any precedent?” There was no precedent at all, because death never informs anybody; it just comes without even knocking on your door.\nThe sun was rising. The old attendant of the emperor, who was almost like his father – because his mother died early, and his father was so much engaged in wars that he had given the small child to this old servant to take care of... The servant had taken care perfectly, so although he was a servant, the emperor almost respected him like a father. He was a substitute father.\nThe old servant came close to him and said, “I am not a scholar, I am not an astrologer, and I am not an alchemist. I don’t know anything about these great things. One thing I know: that you should not stay in this palace. Take our best horse and move as fast and far from the capital as possible. If possible enter into another kingdom.\n“And as far as these scholars are concerned, they have never come to any conclusion – never! They discuss and discuss and every argument leads to another argument, but in the end the hands are empty. So let them discuss. You should not wait, because once the sun has started rising, the setting will not be too far away. In the rising sun itself, the setting of the sun is intrinsic.”\nIt appealed... so he left without saying anything to the great scholars, leaving them to confute each other and fight and argue. He took his best Arabian horse, told the horse, “We have to reach as far away as possible. It is a very critical moment.” Horses and their lovers have a certain way of communicating, just as dogs have a certain way of communicating.\nThe horse started with full speed. They never stopped for a single moment even to drink water or to eat something. They were happy that before the sun set they had crossed the kingdom; they had reached into another kingdom.\nOutside the kingdom there was a great mango grove. The sun was already setting, and the king thanked the horse. He said, “I had no idea that you could go so fast. I knew that you were one of the greatest horses, but this speed...”\nAnd just at that moment he felt a hand on his shoulder. He looked behind him and saw the same black shadow. The black shadow said to the horse, “I was also worried whether you would be able to come this great a distance or not, because the emperor is destined to die in this mango grove. I never inform people, there is no need. The need arose because the distance was so great, and there was no reason for him to leave the palace and to come to this mango grove. Just as the emperor is grateful to you, I am also grateful.”\nA beautiful story, but some deeper approach is needed.\nMind always takes you far away. The servant was perfectly intelligent, rational – far more intelligent than those so-called scholars. But mind is mind.\nIf an enlightened master had been there, he would have said, “It is time enough; you just go in. No horse is needed, you don’t have to move a single inch outside. Just go in and there is no death. Death exists only for those who live their lives in the outside world. To those who have known their innermost core, death is just a shadow. It has no solidity, no substance, no reality.”\nBut Isan continued to teach Kyozan for over forty years.\nEnlightenment can happen in this very moment. It depends on your urgency, totality. Time is not a question, neither is causality. Nothing is needed for it to happen, because it is already there; you only have to turn your vision to look inside.\nFor forty-two years, Isan, a great compassionate master, worked on Kyozan, and finally managed for an almost dead man to become a buddha.\nIsan’s stupa – stupa is the Buddhist word for a memorial – still exists on Mount Kuei where after his enlightenment he established his monastery.\nCertainly he must have been enlightened; his death shows it.\nON FEBRUARY 20TH, 853, HE WENT THROUGH A RITUAL ABLUTION, SEATED HIMSELF IN THE MEDITATION POSTURE AND, SMILING, DIED AT THE AGE OF EIGHTY-THREE. HIS STUPA WAS ERECTED ON MOUNT KUEI, HOME OF HIS MONASTERY.\nTHE EMPEROR GAVE HIM THE POSTHUMOUS TITLE TA YUAN (GREAT PERFECTION).\nSoseki wrote:\nONCE IN A THOUSAND YEARS THE UDUMBARA BLOSSOMS...\nUdumbara is a metaphorical tree. ONCE IN A THOUSAND YEARS THE UDUMBARA BLOOMS.\nIT HAS OPENED ITS AUSPICIOUS FLOWERS. MANY LABORED TO BRING IT\nFROM INDIA TO CHINA.\nITS HEADY FRAGRANCE LINGERS, WITHOUT FADING,\nAND IS NOT LOST\nAMONG THE THOUSAND GRASSES, THE COUNTLESS WEEDS.\nThe same fragrance reached to its crescendo in Japan.\nAnybody who realizes the fact of his being a buddha becomes the flower that blossoms once in thousands of years. And even if the body of the buddha dies, the fragrance remains. Those who have the right sensitivity can smell even this moment Gautam Buddha or Bodhidharma.\nIt is not a question of time. Buddhahood is such an experience... in the body the buddha will die, but in the spirit he will float around you for eternities to come. He has melted in the universal and you can find him even this very moment. We are searching for him every moment. The buddha is our nature.\nQuestion 1 Maneesha has asked:\nOUR BELOVED MASTER,\nIS WITNESSING A LEARNING OR A REMEMBERING?\nManeesha, it is both and it is both not.\nIt is both in the sense that in the beginning you have to learn to enter into your inner temple. And then you have to remember continuously, because to forget again and again is human. But as your remembrance becomes a silent breathing in you, the moment you start breathing buddha in and out, then it is neither learning nor remembering.\nIt is simply you.\nYou have not achieved anything, you have not discovered anything; it has always been there. And whether you remember it or not, it will always remain there.\nThat’s why Zen does not take things seriously. What does it matter? – in this life or in some other life you are to become a buddha.\nThe buddha is the New Man. He is the man of the future.\nThe whole human consciousness is moving towards buddhahood.\nStrangely, it is already there within you, but you are not aware. Hence, a master can be helpful to you.\nIt is just like tickling you (THE MASTER MAKES TICKLING GESTURES TOWARDS US)... and you start laughing, and I have not tickled yet! (AGAIN HE MAKES THE MOVEMENT) ... And you will start feeling...(FOR THE THIRD TIME, HE STRETCHES HIS FINGERS TOWARDS US) the\nmaster’s work is to tickle you. And it is a joy to tickle ten thousand buddhas!\nNow it is time for Sardar Gurudayal Singh. He waits and waits for his time. If I go on continuing to tell jokes to you, one thing is certain: I may die, but Gurudayal Singh is not going to die. He will still wait.\nAt the end of the Sunday school class, the teacher, Miss Holynose, turns to the kids and says, “Now, how many of you children would like to go to heaven?”\nEverybody shoots up their hand, except for one little girl.\n“Come on, Sally,” says Miss Holynose. “Don’t you want to go to heaven?”\n“Sure I want to go to heaven,” replies Sally looking around. “But not with these guys!”\nThe body of Mendel Kravitz is lying in an open coffin in Finkelstein’s Funeral Parlor. As the mourners file past to pay their final respects, Hymie Goldberg clucks his tongue and shakes his head.\n“He was an atheist, he never believed in heaven and hell, you know,” Hymie says to Grandpa Finkelstein, who is standing by the coffin, looking somber.\n“Really?” replies the Fink, looking at the dead Mendel’s immaculate suit and tie. “Then I guess he is all dressed up with nowhere to go!”\nGorgeous Gloria is fed up with her usual boyfriends, so she decides to join a computer match- making service. She sends in all her personal information and preferences and then waits excitedly for the result.\nThe very next day she gets a phone call from her first prospective date. After ten minutes of chatty conversation, the guy suddenly says, “I’m nine inches long and four inches around! Are you interested?”\n“Interested?” cries Gloria. “I’m fascinated! And how big is your prick?” Nivedano...\n(Drumbeat) (Gibberish) Nivedano... (Drumbeat)\nBe silent. Close your eyes. Feel your body to be completely frozen.\nNow look inwards with your totality of consciousness, with an urgency as if this is going to be your last moment of life.\nDeeper and deeper...\nSilence starts deepening. A subtle, undefinable bliss starts arising, a fragrance of udumbara tree. You are very close to buddha; just a little more and you ARE the buddha.\nThe only quality that buddha has is witnessing. Both the words mean the same: be a witness and you are a buddha.\nTo make this witnessing clear, more clear, Nivedano...\n(Drumbeat)\nRelax. The body is there, the mind is there, but you are neither. You are the witness.\nThis witness is your only treasure. Everything will be burned on a funeral pyre; only the witness cannot be touched by any fire, by any sword. The witness is your eternity.\nThe evening was great on its own, but your silence, your peace, your blissfulness have made it a thousand times more beautiful. If you can keep witnessing through the day, twenty-four hours, your whole life will become just an ecstasy.\nA man who dies without knowing ecstasy lived in vain, or lived not.\nBefore Nivedano calls you back, collect as much fragrance as possible to bring with you. You are coming back as a buddha, with the same grace, with the same joy, with the same fulfillment.\nNivedano...

ISAN SAID TO HIM, “YOU
ARE NOW CALLED A GOOD AND CLEVER TEACHER. HOW CAN YOU DISTINGUISH
BETWEEN THOSE WHO COME FROM ALL PARTS AND KNOW IT, AND THOSE WHO DON’T
KNOW IT; THE MASTERS WHO HAVE INHERITED IT, AND THOSE WHO HAVE NOT; THE
PROFOUND LEARNING, AND THE MEANING LEARNING? EXPLAIN AND LET ME
HEAR.”</p><p>KYOZAN REPLIED, “KYOZAN HAS HAD THIS EXPERIENCE. WHEN MONKS COME FROM
ALL DIRECTIONS, HE RAISES HIS STICK, AND ASKS THEM IF THIS IS EXPOUNDED
WHERE THEY COME FROM OR NOT. FURTHER, HE SAYS TO THEM, LEAVING THIS
ASIDE, ‘WHAT ARE THE OLD MASTERS WHERE YOU COME FROM TEACHING?’”</p><p>ISAN ADMIRED HIM AND SAID, “THIS HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE CLAW AND FANG OF
OUR SECT.”</p><p>Maneesha, the silence here is so dense, one feels a little afraid
even to utter a word. It may disturb the silent lake of your
consciousness. But always remember that in the wake of words, silence is
deepened. The higher the mountain, the greater will be the valley
surrounding it. A great mountain cannot have a small valley. There is a
tremendous balance in everything as far as nature is concerned.</p><p>The essential Zen is an effort to bring you to the language of
existence that you have forgotten completely. You have forgotten
completely the most important, and you are filled in your mind with all
kinds of gibberish.</p><p>You may know, you may not know, that gibberish is not an English
word. It comes from Persia, the old name of Iran, and it comes from a
very mystical person, Jabbar, because he never spoke anything relevant.
Not only was it irrelevant, there was no grammar, there were no words at
all, but only sounds. Because of Jabbar, the name ‘gibberish’ came into
existence.</p><p><br></p><p>But Jabbar was saying something through his gibberish. He was saying,
“All that we can say about existence is gibberish.” He was very much in
tune with existence.</p><p><br></p><p>It seems unbelievable that he had one thousand disciples. Sitting by
his side, when he was silent they would be silent; when he would go into
gibberish, they would go into gibberish – and nearabout twenty-five
people became enlightened. Not a word was said by Jabbar, nothing was
heard by anybody.</p><p><br></p><p>You cannot write a treatise on Jabbar because he never spoke anything
except gibberish. But he was a radiant man, a man who had come to
flowering, whose spring had come, and who was not afraid to be
vulnerable and open and receptive. He went along with the wind.</p><p><br></p><p>Zen has done the same from a different angle, but you must be aware
of the fact that any authentic master – to whatever age, to whatever
country he belongs – is not interested in preaching you a doctrine. His
interest is to bring you in communion, in balance with the reality that
surrounds you.</p><p><br></p><p>Zen has used many methods never known before. You cannot conceive in
a Greek context the validity of any method of Zen. Even Socrates and
Plato would have been at a loss if they had met Bodhidharma or
Jabbar.</p><p><br></p><p>I always think what a hilarious meeting it would be: Jabbar meeting
Socrates. Socrates was so logical, so rational. His honesty was exactly
the same as Jabbar’s; he was ready to risk his life for his truth, but
still he did not rise, until the last moment of his life, to
enlightenment. The day he dropped all knowledge, all wisdom, the day he
dropped language as such, that very moment a tremendous silence
descended upon him. And those of you who are slowly slowly moving
towards the great experience will become aware of it – not because I say
so, but because you experience it so.</p><p><br></p><p>How can you say anything about the tremendous silence that is here
now? Our minds are preventing us... our minds are taking us away from
the very center of our being. The mind is not interested at all in an
interior exploration. It is absolutely committed to the outside and the
objective.</p><p><br></p><p>Before I talk about Isan’s sutra... because this sutra will be the
last of this series and also this sutra is the last of Isan’s life. This
sutra ends exactly at the time Isan dies.</p><p><br></p><p>The death of a person indicates how he has lived, whether he has
lived at all or not. You may be believing that you are living, but don’t
be so certain.</p><p><br></p><p>Every madman in all the madhouses in the world believes absolutely
that he is not mad. He wonders why people consider him to be mad. Slowly
slowly he comes to the conclusion that the world is mad: “Poor fellows,
they cannot understand my state.”</p><p>A man who had been crazy all his life went beyond the boundary. Small
trips beyond the mind can be tolerated, but he went a little too far; he
started saying that “I am dead.”</p><p><br></p><p>Everybody laughed, everybody said, “This is too much. You have
already been doing great things.… And how can you be dead? – you are
speaking!”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “So what? Dead people speak.”</p><p><br></p><p>They told him, “You are walking, you are eating, you are
sleeping.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “That does not prove that I am alive. That simply proves
that I am vegetating. But as far as my deadness is concerned... I am
absolutely certain.”</p><p><br></p><p>They took the man finally to a psychoanalyst. The psychoanalyst said
to the family, “Don’t be worried. It will take a little time. You leave
him with me. He has to come for a one hour session twice a week.”</p><p><br></p><p>All this time, the madman who had now become dead was smiling.</p><p><br></p><p>The first question the psychoanalyst asked him was, “Why are you
smiling?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Strange... a single man is alive amongst a group who are
all dead. But just to convince themselves that they are alive, they are
trying to convince me that ‘You are also alive’ – and I have never seen
anything living in me.”</p><p><br></p><p>The psychoanalyst was at a loss himself, because this was an
absolutely new case. He had never dealt with dead people, but he figured
out a way. He took a knife and cut the madman’s finger. Blood started
coming out. The psychoanalyst said, “Have you ever heard that dead men
don’t bleed?”</p><p><br></p><p>The man said, “Yes. While I was alive I heard this saying.”</p><p><br></p><p>The psychoanalyst felt great pride, but the madman said, “Don’t be
proud. It does not prove that I am not dead. It only proves that the
proverb is wrong. Dead men do bleed. I am an example, a living
example!”</p><p><br></p><p>After two, three sessions, the psychoanalyst was continuously
thinking about the man. And slowly slowly a doubt started arising in
him, “If somebody asks me to prove it, how am I going to prove that I am
alive?”</p><p><br></p><p>That night he could not sleep. Next day was his session. He said to
the man, “I will not charge you anything, but please leave me alone. You
can find some other psychoanalyst – they are a rupee a dozen – because I
am becoming suspicious about my own life. Rather than convincing you
that you are dead, you are by and by convincing me that who knows? – I
may have died! Perhaps I am dreaming that I am alive.”</p><p><br></p><p>What proof have you that you are not dreaming?</p><p>Death is the criterion in the tradition of Zen. How a man dies proves
whether he has lived or not. Only a living man can die; you cannot
afford to die if you have not lived.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard about a great scholar. He became aware that he was alive
only when he was dead. Then suddenly he realized, “My God! I used to be
alive, and I never took any notice of it.”</p><p><br></p><p>Particularly in Zen, the masters show the highest peaks of
consciousness. Death is the criterion. If you can die gracefully,
blissfully, almost dancingly, that proves that you have lived, and you
have lived so deeply that you know that death is only the changing of
the house.</p><p><br></p><p>KYOZAN ONCE RETURNED TO ISAN TO INTERVIEW HIM.</p><p><br></p><p>You will be surprised... That is another speciality in Zen, that
disciples come to interview the master – nowhere else. But Zen is very
playful. Its playfulness is so deep that it takes nothing seriously.</p><p><br></p><p>KYOZAN ONCE RETURNED TO ISAN TO INTERVIEW HIM. ISAN SAID TO HIM, “YOU
ARE NOW CALLED A GOOD AND CLEVER TEACHER. HOW CAN YOU DISTINGUISH
BETWEEN THOSE WHO COME FROM ALL PARTS AND KNOW IT, AND THOSE WHO DON’T
KNOW IT; THE MASTERS WHO HAVE INHERITED IT, AND THOSE WHO HAVE NOT; THE
PROFOUND LEARNING, AND THE MEANING LEARNING. EXPLAIN AND LET ME
HEAR.”</p><p><br></p><p>KYOZAN REPLIED, “KYOZAN HAS HAD THIS EXPERIENCE. WHEN MONKS COME FROM
ALL DIRECTIONS, HE RAISES HIS STICK, AND ASKS THEM IF THIS IS EXPOUNDED
WHERE THEY COME FROM OR NOT. FURTHER, HE SAYS TO THEM, LEAVING THIS
ASIDE, ‘WHAT ARE THE OLD MASTERS WHERE YOU COME FROM TEACHING?’”</p><p><br></p><p>ISAN ADMIRED HIM AND SAID, “THIS HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE CLAW AND FANG OF
OUR SECT.”</p><p><br></p><p>A few things to be noted.</p><p><br></p><p>Kyozan succeeded Isan. But to interview the master before he became
enlightened shows his daringness, his courage. And it also shows the
grace and greatness of Isan that he did not object to it: “You don’t
know anything about it, and you are trying to interview me?”</p><p><br></p><p>But without saying it, if you look at the whole thing, it becomes
just the opposite. It is an interview not of Isan by Kyozan, but an
interview by Isan of Kyozan. He did not say anything to hurt him, he did
not reject the interview or say that “You are not of the quality yet;
you have not experienced your innermost core.” Rather than rejecting,
Isan accepts it and starts the interview himself.</p><p><br></p><p>KYOZAN REPLIED, “KYOZAN HAS HAD THIS EXPERIENCE...” because Isan has
asked, “How do you teach people? And how do you know whether somebody
knows or not? whether somebody is a master or only a pretender?” And
Kyozan has forgotten completely that he has come to interview Isan, and
he is being interviewed – the craftsmanship of a great master.</p><p><br></p><p>KYOZAN REPLIED, “KYOZAN HAS HAD THIS EXPERIENCE. WHEN MONKS COME FROM
ALL DIRECTIONS, HE RAISES HIS STICK, AND ASKS THEM IF THIS IS
EXPOUNDED...”</p><p>He is not asking about the stick, he is raising the stick to indicate
“thisness.” Are you coming from a master who has explained to you
“thisness,” the present moment of splendor, the great moment of being
nobody? – because a master never hits a disciple unless a disciple is
really able to be awakened by a single hit.</p><p><br></p><p>Kyozan said, “WHEN MONKS COME FROM ALL DIRECTIONS, HE RAISES HIS
STICK, AND ASKS THEM IF THIS IS EXPOUNDED WHERE THEY COME FROM OR NOT.
FURTHER, HE SAYS TO THEM, LEAVING THIS ASIDE, ‘WHAT ARE THE OLD MASTERS
WHERE YOU COME FROM TEACHING?’”</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, if you have found a master you have found your home; there
is nowhere to go. Or wherever you go you will find your master and
nobody else.</p><p><br></p><p>When Gautam Buddha became enlightened his first words were strange:
“Not only I am enlightened, the whole existence is enlightened with me.
This music, this music of silence, soundless, these flowers, invisible,
falling all over the place – I was just keeping my eyes closed. Today my
eyes are open, but that does not make me superior. From the smallest
blade of grass to the greatest star everything is in blissfulness.”</p><p><br></p><p>Man has created only one thing: misery for himself and misery for
others. We are great creators of misery. If someday nothing terrible
happens to you, that day is wasted – something terrible so that you can
talk about it, rejoice about it, some great tragedy. People don’t like
to see comedies, people like to see tragedies.</p><p><br></p><p>When there is a war going on, everybody gets up early in the morning
to find the newspaper, what is happening. Everybody looks fresh;
something terrible is happening, so many thousands of people are dying.
We have become so accustomed to tragedy, and comedy seems to be
tasteless.</p><p><br></p><p>When you have found a master, you have found him. You can remain, you
can go, but the master has settled in your heart.</p><p><br></p><p>Those who go on and on are simply indicating that they have not found
the man who makes your heart dance. They have not clicked with somebody.
They have not found a man of presence who engulfs you with love and joy,
compassion and light, life and love, beauty and truth, and all that is
divine in existence. Unless you have seen those two eyes in which all
that is divine reflects, you have to go on in the hope that somewhere
you may find.</p><p><br></p><p>But remember always, because you can miss a real master, that you
have to be absolutely receptive, utterly open, with no doors closed,
with no windows closed. The fresh breeze comes with great fragrance, the
coolness of it... the perfume of it is always available; just your doors
were closed.</p><p><br></p><p>So if you don’t find a master, don’t think that there is no master.
First, begin to see: Are you able to receive a master? Is your heart
open? Is not your mind burdened with many kind of prejudices?</p><p><br></p><p>What are all your religions except prejudices? No man of intelligence
can depend on birth; birth is accidental. You are born a Hindu, that
does not make you a Hindu. You are born a Mohammedan, that does not make
you a Mohammedan. Such a great phenomenon as religion cannot be left</p><p>hanging on the accidental phenomenon of birth. You have to choose it.
You have to find it. Everybody has to go into deeper search.</p><p><br></p><p>ISAN ADMIRED HIM.…</p><p><br></p><p>Remember, admiration is not the real appreciation of a master. If
Isan had given him a good slap, or a good stick, that would have been
appreciation.</p><p><br></p><p>Our stickholder – because I am a lazy man, I cannot carry the stick –
has come from Germany. Just show your stick and hit poor Maneesha!
(NISKRIYA TAKES THE STICK AND TAPS MANEESHA ON THE HEAD. IT MAKES A
LOUD, SHARP CLICK.)</p><p><br></p><p>Good!</p><p><br></p><p>ISAN ADMIRED HIM AND SAID, “THIS HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE CLAW AND FANG OF
OUR SECT.”</p><p><br></p><p>Seeing that Kyozan would not understand, he is not yet ripe, Isan
avoided the stick.</p><p><br></p><p>ISAN TAUGHT FOR OVER FORTY YEARS DURING WHICH TIME HE GATHERED
INNUMERABLE DISCIPLES. ON FEBRUARY 20TH, 853, HE WENT THROUGH A RITUAL
ABLUTION, SEATED HIMSELF IN THE MEDITATION POSTURE AND, SMILING, DIED AT
THE AGE OF EIGHTY-THREE. HIS STUPA WAS ERECTED ON MOUNT KUEI, HOME OF
HIS MONASTERY.</p><p><br></p><p>THE EMPEROR GAVE HIM THE POSTHUMOUS TITLE TA YUAN (GREAT
PERFECTION).</p><p><br></p><p>Isan must have worked hard in polishing an ordinary stone into a
diamond. The whole glory and credit goes to Isan. He turned an ordinary
man into a great perfection.</p><p><br></p><p>Kyozan does not show much insight, intelligence, meditativeness, but
it is the compassion of the master to do his best. Forty years he worked
on Kyozan. It is a long time, but for compassion neither time means
anything nor space means anything. Isan succeeded in bringing him
home.</p><p><br></p><p>I am reminded of a great emperor who dreamed one night that a great
black shadow was standing before him. With trembling hands and throbbing
heart, he asked, “Who are you?”</p><p><br></p><p>The shadow said, “That we will discuss later on. I have come to
inform you that tomorrow evening as the sun will be setting you will
die.” And the shadow disappeared, and with the shadow the sleep also
disappeared.</p><p><br></p><p>The king was perspiring. He called the attendant. In the middle of
the night all the astrologers, palmists, prophets were called to
interpret the dream: What does it mean?</p><p><br></p><p>They started looking in their great scriptures, “Is there any
precedent?” There was no precedent at all, because death never informs
anybody; it just comes without even knocking on your door.</p><p>The sun was rising. The old attendant of the emperor, who was almost
like his father – because his mother died early, and his father was so
much engaged in wars that he had given the small child to this old
servant to take care of... The servant had taken care perfectly, so
although he was a servant, the emperor almost respected him like a
father. He was a substitute father.</p><p><br></p><p>The old servant came close to him and said, “I am not a scholar, I am
not an astrologer, and I am not an alchemist. I don’t know anything
about these great things. One thing I know: that you should not stay in
this palace. Take our best horse and move as fast and far from the
capital as possible. If possible enter into another kingdom.</p><p><br></p><p>“And as far as these scholars are concerned, they have never come to
any conclusion – never! They discuss and discuss and every argument
leads to another argument, but in the end the hands are empty. So let
them discuss. You should not wait, because once the sun has started
rising, the setting will not be too far away. In the rising sun itself,
the setting of the sun is intrinsic.”</p><p><br></p><p>It appealed... so he left without saying anything to the great
scholars, leaving them to confute each other and fight and argue. He
took his best Arabian horse, told the horse, “We have to reach as far
away as possible. It is a very critical moment.” Horses and their lovers
have a certain way of communicating, just as dogs have a certain way of
communicating.</p><p><br></p><p>The horse started with full speed. They never stopped for a single
moment even to drink water or to eat something. They were happy that
before the sun set they had crossed the kingdom; they had reached into
another kingdom.</p><p><br></p><p>Outside the kingdom there was a great mango grove. The sun was
already setting, and the king thanked the horse. He said, “I had no idea
that you could go so fast. I knew that you were one of the greatest
horses, but this speed...”</p><p><br></p><p>And just at that moment he felt a hand on his shoulder. He looked
behind him and saw the same black shadow. The black shadow said to the
horse, “I was also worried whether you would be able to come this great
a distance or not, because the emperor is destined to die in this mango
grove. I never inform people, there is no need. The need arose because
the distance was so great, and there was no reason for him to leave the
palace and to come to this mango grove. Just as the emperor is grateful
to you, I am also grateful.”</p><p><br></p><p>A beautiful story, but some deeper approach is needed.</p><p><br></p><p>Mind always takes you far away. The servant was perfectly
intelligent, rational – far more intelligent than those so-called
scholars. But mind is mind.</p><p><br></p><p>If an enlightened master had been there, he would have said, “It is
time enough; you just go in. No horse is needed, you don’t have to move
a single inch outside. Just go in and there is no death. Death exists
only for those who live their lives in the outside world. To those who
have known their innermost core, death is just a shadow. It has no
solidity, no substance, no reality.”</p><p><br></p><p>But Isan continued to teach Kyozan for over forty years.</p><p>Enlightenment can happen in this very moment. It depends on your
urgency, totality. Time is not a question, neither is causality. Nothing
is needed for it to happen, because it is already there; you only have
to turn your vision to look inside.</p><p><br></p><p>For forty-two years, Isan, a great compassionate master, worked on
Kyozan, and finally managed for an almost dead man to become a
buddha.</p><p><br></p><p>Isan’s stupa – stupa is the Buddhist word for a memorial – still
exists on Mount Kuei where after his enlightenment he established his
monastery.</p><p><br></p><p>Certainly he must have been enlightened; his death shows it.</p><p><br></p><p>ON FEBRUARY 20TH, 853, HE WENT THROUGH A RITUAL ABLUTION, SEATED
HIMSELF IN THE MEDITATION POSTURE AND, SMILING, DIED AT THE AGE OF
EIGHTY-THREE. HIS STUPA WAS ERECTED ON MOUNT KUEI, HOME OF HIS

PERFECTION).</p><p><br></p><p>Soseki wrote:</p><p><br></p><p>ONCE IN A THOUSAND YEARS THE UDUMBARA BLOSSOMS...</p><p>Udumbara is a metaphorical tree. ONCE IN A THOUSAND YEARS THE

the body the buddha will die, but in the spirit he will float around you
for eternities to come. He has melted in the universal and you can find
him even this very moment. We are searching for him every moment. The
buddha is our nature.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 1 Maneesha has asked:</p><p>OUR BELOVED MASTER,</p><p><br></p><p>IS WITNESSING A LEARNING OR A REMEMBERING?</p><p><br></p><p>Maneesha, it is both and it is both not.</p><p><br></p><p>It is both in the sense that in the beginning you have to learn to
enter into your inner temple. And then you have to remember
continuously, because to forget again and again is human. But as your
remembrance becomes a silent breathing in you, the moment you start
breathing buddha in and out, then it is neither learning nor
remembering.</p><p><br></p><p>It is simply you.</p><p><br></p><p>You have not achieved anything, you have not discovered anything; it
has always been there. And whether you remember it or not, it will
always remain there.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why Zen does not take things seriously. What does it matter? –
in this life or in some other life you are to become a buddha.</p><p><br></p><p>The buddha is the New Man. He is the man of the future.</p><p>The whole human consciousness is moving towards buddhahood.</p><p><br></p><p>Strangely, it is already there within you, but you are not aware.
Hence, a master can be helpful to you.</p><p><br></p><p>It is just like tickling you (THE MASTER MAKES TICKLING GESTURES

final respects, Hymie Goldberg clucks his tongue and shakes his
head.</p><p><br></p><p>“He was an atheist, he never believed in heaven and hell, you know,”
Hymie says to Grandpa Finkelstein, who is standing by the coffin,
looking somber.</p><p><br></p><p>“Really?” replies the Fink, looking at the dead Mendel’s immaculate
suit and tie. “Then I guess he is all dressed up with nowhere to
go!”</p><p><br></p><p>Gorgeous Gloria is fed up with her usual boyfriends, so she decides
to join a computer match- making service. She sends in all her personal
information and preferences and then waits excitedly for the result.</p><p><br></p><p>The very next day she gets a phone call from her first prospective
date. After ten minutes of chatty conversation, the guy suddenly says,
“I’m nine inches long and four inches around! Are you interested?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Interested?” cries Gloria. “I’m fascinated! And how big is your
prick?” Nivedano...</p><p>(Drumbeat) (Gibberish) Nivedano... (Drumbeat)</p><p>Be silent. Close your eyes. Feel your body to be completely
frozen.</p><p><br></p><p>Now look inwards with your totality of consciousness, with an urgency
as if this is going to be your last moment of life.</p><p><br></p><p>Deeper and deeper...</p><p><br></p><p>Silence starts deepening. A subtle, undefinable bliss starts arising,
a fragrance of udumbara tree. You are very close to buddha; just a
little more and you ARE the buddha.</p><p>The only quality that buddha has is witnessing. Both the words mean
the same: be a witness and you are a buddha.</p><p><br></p><p>To make this witnessing clear, more clear, Nivedano...</p><p>(Drumbeat)</p><p><br></p><p>Relax. The body is there, the mind is there, but you are neither. You
are the witness.</p><p>This witness is your only treasure. Everything will be burned on a
funeral pyre; only the witness cannot be touched by any fire, by any
sword. The witness is your eternity.</p><p><br></p><p>The evening was great on its own, but your silence, your peace, your
blissfulness have made it a thousand times more beautiful. If you can
keep witnessing through the day, twenty-four hours, your whole life will
become just an ecstasy.</p><p><br></p><p>A man who dies without knowing ecstasy lived in vain, or lived
not.</p><p><br></p><p>Before Nivedano calls you back, collect as much fragrance as possible
to bring with you. You are coming back as a buddha, with the same grace,
with the same joy, with the same fulfillment.</p><p><br></p><p>Nivedano... (Drumbeat)</p><p>Come back silently.</p><p><br></p><p>Sit for a few minutes recollecting the experience you have been
through, because you have to keep this experience around the clock. A
day will come when you will not need to remember it. It will be there
whether you look at it or not.</p><p><br></p><p>That day comes! – I can say it with absolute authority, because it
has come to me; why can it not come to you?</p><p><br></p><p>Every human being is a seed of the buddha.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part7>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a></p><p>  </p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://osho.lol/posts/philosophia_perennis_vol_2/part8/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>8 Escape to Reality</span>

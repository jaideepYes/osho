ISAN REPLIED: “IT IS FOOLISH TO COMPOSE ONE WHEN FACE TO FACE – AND, IN ANY CASE, WRITING THINGS ON PAPER!”\nSO ICHU WENT TO KYOZAN, A DISCIPLE OF ISAN, AND MADE THE SAME REQUEST.\nIN RESPONSE, KYOZAN DREW A CIRCLE ON PAPER AND WROTE A NOTE NEXT TO IT THAT SAID: “TO THINK AND THEN KNOW IS THE SECOND GRADE. NOT TO THINK AND THEN KNOW IS THE THIRD GRADE.”\nManeesha, before discussing your sutras, a little biographical note on Isan is essential. I say it is essential because unless you understand the man, his background, his upbringing, his qualities, you will not be able to grasp just the pure sutras. They are almost writings in the air, or, if you prefer, in the water. The man who has written the sutras or told the sutras, or managed these anecdotes, has to be understood to understand all that is connected with him, because his whole being covers and colors whatever he says. You cannot take it out of context.\nIsan is a totally different personality than Bodhidharma. Bodhidharma was a hard master; Isan was very polite. Naturally his politeness would affect whatever happened around him. He was a very humble person, never tried to convert anybody, but on the contrary slipped deep down into the forest, so nobody came to him. He felt it a little embarrassing to be the master and degrade somebody as a follower – a very nice, very delicate personality, the personality of a poet, of a singer, of a dancer.\nISAN WAS A MELLOW AND PATIENT MASTER IN GUIDING HIS DISCIPLES TO ATTAIN THEIR ENLIGHTENMENT.\nHe never used shouting or hitting or beating; that was not possible for him. He was such a loving, compassionate being that to think of him hitting the way Zen masters hit is impossible. He was very humble; hence he had to create absolutely different devices than those of Bodhidharma or Nansen.\nISAN WAS A MELLOW AND PATIENT MASTER IN GUIDING HIS DISCIPLES TO ATTAIN THEIR ENLIGHTENMENT. UNLIKE THOSE ZEN MASTERS WHO PRECEDED HIM, HE DID NOT USE THE STICK OR SHOUT.\nHOWEVER, HIS MILDNESS OF MANNER WAS ONLY A VENEER FOR THE ICONOCLAST AND REBEL WITHIN.\nYou should not understand that his humbleness was not a rebellious quality. You should not think that his humbleness made him compromise with the past and the traditions. He remained a great rebel against all that goes towards preventing a person’s enlightenment.\nSo his mildness of manner was only a veneer, just a cover for the iconoclast and rebel within. Deep down he was fire. On the surface he was very polite. Those who came to him because of his politeness – because there were many who were afraid of the Zen masters who would beat, who would hit, who would suddenly jump on you; their behavior looked so irrational. Isan looked very good compared to the other predecessors. Although he never was interested in people, still in the deepest forest one thousand disciples had gathered, and they had come from such faraway places just because they had heard that Isan was not a man to hit or slap. He was so mild and so humble and so loving.…\nBut this was only a veneer. Inside there was glowing fire. Once you had come close to him, because of his humbleness, because of his very friendly behavior, you were caught in the net. As you would\ncome closer, you would know the fiery nature of his being – but it was too late to go back. You had fallen in love with the man. Now whatever happens, if you have to pass through this fire, you will pass through this fire.\nManeesha has brought one anecdote:\nOUR BELOVED MASTER,\nON ONE OCCASION, A MONK CAME TO ISAN’S MONASTERY TO BE TAUGHT, AND, SEEING HIM, ISAN MADE AS IF TO GET UP.\n“PLEASE DON’T STAND UP!” EXCLAIMED THE MONK. “I HAVE NOT SAT DOWN YET!” SAID ISAN.\nWhen you are in the middle, it is very difficult to say whether you are going to sit down or you are going to get up.\nMulla Nasruddin used to suggest to his followers that if you don’t want to be bored by anybody, just take your umbrella and stand in the door.\nIf the fellow is alright and you would like to welcome him, you can say, “You came at the right time; I was just coming in.” And if the fellow is a bore, you can say, “Excuse me, you came at a wrong time. I am going out.” But just standing at the door with the umbrella, now it is very difficult to decide where the man is going, whether in or out. He is standing in the door, in the middle.\nThe same was the position: the man has come TO BE TAUGHT, AND SEEING HIM, ISAN MADE AS IF TO GET UP. It was a strategy to know his response, how the other man will behave. Isan was not getting up; he just made as if he was going to get up.\n“PLEASE DON’T STAND UP!” Because you stand up to give honor to someone, the man naturally thought that Isan was going to honor him by standing. “PLEASE DON’T STAND UP!” EXCLAIMED THE MONK.\nBut such was the subtle way of Isan to know about the inner mind of man. This man looks perfectly right in saying, “PLEASE DON’T STAND UP!” But on what grounds has he assumed that Isan should be standing up to welcome him?\n“I HAVEN’T SAT DOWN YET!” SAID ISAN. “What about standing up? – I was just going to sit down. Why did you assume...?”\nPerhaps that assumption is a deep expectation that he should be honored. Perhaps it is unconscious, but Isan has brought it to the surface. The man could have thought that Isan was going to sit down. He was in the middle – both possibilities were available to him – but the man had chosen the possibility that Isan was going to stand up. That shows his mind – a deep longing, a desire to be honored, although he has come only as a student to be taught.\nIsan said, “I HAVEN’T SAT DOWN YET” – the question of standing does not arise.\nBut the poor monk did not understand the subtle way: “I HAVEN’T BOWED YET,” THE MONK SAID. “YOU RUDE CREATURE!” COMMENTED ISAN.\nVery strange encounters! When Isan said, “I HAVEN’T SAT DOWN YET!”, that was the moment to bow down and touch his feet, and to offer himself for the discipline, for the meditation, for all his teachings.\nRather than taking that, he retorted – he thought as if Isan was making a fool of him – “I HAVEN’T BOWED YET,” THE MONK SAID.\n“YOU RUDE CREATURE!” COMMENTED ISAN. “This is not the way to be with me. You have to be grateful to be allowed to see me. Instead of it you are showing your ego.”\n“I HAVEN’T BOWED YET,” he is saying. “Don’t consider that I am your disciple or I am your student; I have not even bowed yet.” And he has come to learn, but ego is such a subtle phenomenon that without your knowing, it immediately asserts. The ego simply retorted, “I HAVEN’T BOWED YET.”\nNow, this has to be understood. There are things which should not be said; the very moment you say them they lose all their grandeur, gratefulness. You have to behave in a way that shows your gratitude, not your words.\nBowing down is a gesture of saying, “I am ready. You can trust that I will not misuse the time that you will give me, or the meditation or any kind of discipline. I will not misuse it. I have come to you whole-heartedly.” It is just a way, without words, of saying, “I am available.”\nBut the man said instead, “I HAVEN’T BOWED YET.”\nAs if a man like Isan is in need of your gratefulness! By being grateful to a person like Isan, you are not making him in any way richer; on the contrary, you are becoming richer. You are learning a new way, a new gesture and its significance.\nIn the West it never evolved that the disciple should touch the feet of the master, and even today the Western mind thinks it really strange – one human being touching the feet of another human being. But they don’t know the significance of it, they don’t know the esoteric significance of it.\nWhen the disciple touches the feet of the master, it is not only what you see, something else is happening. When the disciple touches the feet, the master touches his head. A circle of energy is created that is not visible to the eyes – because no energy is ever visible to you. You only see the gesture: one is touching the feet, the other is touching his head.\nBut the East, for at least ten thousand years, has come to know this secret way of approaching a master. And the master will put his hand on your head only if he feels your energy is worth it. By touching his feet... You should remember that energy moves only from the fingers of the hand or from the toes of the feet; energy moves from points which are dead ends. When somebody touches his feet, the master immediately recognizes the kind of energy. If he feels that the person has to be accepted, is worth being worked upon, then he touches his head, and with his hand he gives a\ntaste of his energy, and then both energies become a circle. And if the circle becomes smooth great possibilities can happen.\nBut for the outsider it seems simply that one person is touching the feet of another person. The West has not been able, even today, to understand. Life is not what it appears from the outside; it is much more, immensely more, on the inside.\nThe man showed an egoistic pattern of his mind. That’s why Isan had to comment, “YOU RUDE CREATURE!” He was not accepted as a disciple.\nTo be accepted as a disciple by a great master is not a small thing. In that very acceptance your enlightenment has come miles closer, your liberation has taken a tremendous quantum leap. You are just on the verge, ready, just because the master has accepted you. He accepts only when he sees the possibility, the vulnerability, the openness. It is an inner drama which is not visible to the eyes.\nON ANOTHER OCCASION, ISAN WAS WATCHING A BRUSH FIRE, AND ASKED HIS DISCIPLE, DOGO, “DO YOU SEE THE FIRE?”\nNow, it will look strange – the fire is there, Dogo, his disciple, is there, Isan is sitting there. There is no reason why Dogo should be asked, “DO YOU SEE THE FIRE?”\nReplied Dogo, “I SEE IT.”\nTHE MASTER ASKED DOGO, “WHERE DOES THE FIRE COME FROM?”\nDOGO SAID, “I WOULD LIKE YOU TO ASK ME SOMETHING THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH WALKING AROUND OR ZAZEN OR LYING DOWN” – AT WHICH ISAN LEFT OFF TALKING AND WENT AWAY.\nDogo has closed all the doors. When Isan was asking, “DO YOU SEE THE FIRE?” he should have been alert. When you are with a master you have to be alert every moment. What he says must imply some greater significance which may not appear in the words.\nNow, it is a strange question. They both are seeing the fire; but if the master asks, “DO YOU SEE THE FIRE?” he means many things which Dogo is missing. He means, “Are you here?” You can be seeing the fire and yet you may be somewhere else and the fire may be just a faraway, faded thing. It may not be a living experience right now. If your mind is full of thoughts, you can even miss the fire, because who is going to see it? You have to be here – that is the point that is hidden behind the question.\nIf Dogo had had the understanding he would have immediately thought that the question means his mind has moved somewhere else. He must have been thinking of other things, other worlds, other matters.\nI have told you a story about two friends.\nOne morning they met. The first friend said, “You will not believe it: last night I had a dream I had gone fishing, and I caught such big fish that I had to carry one fish at a time. The whole night it continued. It was strange – for years I have been fishing and I have never found such great fish. You should have seen what a joy it was.”\nThe other man said, “That is nothing. Last night I dreamed that in my bedroom, in my bed itself, on one side was Marilyn Monroe, utterly naked, on the other side Sophia Loren, utterly naked. I was greatly shocked. I had never believed that this chance would arise in my lifetime.”\nThe first friend said, “You idiot! Why did you not call me?”\nThe second man said, “I did call, but your wife said you had gone fishing!”\nPeople seem to be somewhere, but their minds may be anywhere. To be in the moment is a clear-cut message of Zen.\nIsan’s asking Dogo, “DO YOU SEE THE FIRE?” certainly meant that Dogo was not there. He was just sitting there but his mind had roamed away. It would have been right for him to say, “I don’t see it, because I have gone into my thoughts somewhere else.” But rather than telling the truth he said, “I SEE IT.”\nTHE MASTER ASKED DOGO, “If you see it, can you tell me WHERE DOES THE FIRE COME FROM?” Now he is asking, from where do all things come – the fire is only a symbol – and where do they go finally? What is the source from which they arise and what is the point where they disappear?\nTo the meditator it becomes slowly clear that the source and the goal are one. The same point is the source; the energy moves in a circle, and comes back to the same point. You are at the same point both the times – when you are born and when you die. You may have changed much meanwhile – so much experience, so much knowledge – that’s why you miss the pure innocence of death. You missed the innocence of birth because of your ignorance, and you miss the innocence of death because of your knowledge.\nOf course you were not expected to recognize innocence in your birth, you can be forgiven for that; you were not told or taught. The experience was so new, you could not name it even. But the man who dies full of knowledge again misses the innocence, because of his knowledgeability.\nIn mystic circles around the world it has been a long-standing understanding that unless a man is just like his birth-innocence when he dies, he missed the whole point and the whole dance of life, he missed the whole significance of life. He has taken a long route of seventy or eighty years, and has come back to the source, but missed it again.\nIn India, the word for the experience of this circle, the word that is used is sansar. Sansar means both the world and the circle. The whole world is a circular experience. In the beginning you are innocent; you should be innocent at the end. Then your life has been a great life of love, of understanding, of many flowers, of many blessings. You have not lived insanely, you have lived intelligently, you have lived meditatively; you have lived out of silence, not out of anxiety, anguish, and thoughts.\nA man is complete only when at the moment of his death he is again the same as he was when he was born, again a child – the second childhood.\nSo when Dogo was asked by the master, “WHERE DOES THE FIRE COME FROM?” the fire was just an excuse. He was asking, “From where do things come and where do they go?”\nBut Dogo again missed. Rather than answering the question, DOGO SAID, “I WOULD LIKE YOU TO ASK ME SOMETHING THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH WALKING AROUND OR ZAZEN OR LYING DOWN” – AT WHICH ISAN LEFT OFF TALKING AND WENT AWAY.\nDogo has closed all the doors. He is saying, “You should ask me something which is not concerned with zazen – that is intense meditation – or a walking meditation, or a lying down meditation.”\nBuddha used all actions in life as an opportunity to meditate. Walking, you should walk meditatively, each step with full awareness. Lying down, you should lie down with awareness, not just out of old habit. And zazen is the intense and urgent quality of meditativeness.\nDogo is saying to his master, who has asked, “WHERE DOES THE FIRE COME FROM?”... He has not answered the question because that question implies meditation. Only in meditation can you know that everything comes from the same source and goes back to the same eternity. Nothing ever dies, nothing ever is born; everything is, only forms go on changing. What was sometime before wood, is now fire; what is fire soon will be smoke.\nThese are the ways of disappearing into the ultimate reality. The fire was hidden, so long remained hidden in the tree. Now it has blossomed, just as flowers blossom; it has come out of the prison. A little dance, a little joyful life, and the fire will turn into smoke. Smoke will have a little joyful life, and slowly slowly will disappear into the eternal. This implies a meditative experience.\nRather than answering it, because only a meditator can answer from where the fire comes... Unless you know your own center, how can you answer from where your fire comes? Your life is a fire, and where does it go finally? Does it disappear outside or does it again relapse into the origin? Only the meditator has known the secrets of inner life. Life sometimes is dormant in the center and sometimes comes to the circumference, and when tired goes back to the center.\nOne of the greatest men in history was Patanjali, who created a whole science of yoga single- handed. It is very difficult to create a whole science alone. Five thousand years have passed and not a single word has been added, it has such a completion; neither has a single word been taken out. The system is so complete in itself, there is no possibility to go beyond Patanjali as far as yoga is concerned.\nBut only people who will go deeper into themselves will know that they are carrying the source and the goal both at the same center. Everything comes from the same center of the universe and goes back finally into the same center.\nBut rather than answering the question – perhaps he was not able to answer it – on the contrary, he was closing all doors. He was saying, “I WOULD LIKE YOU TO ASK ME SOMETHING THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH WALKING – because in Zen monasteries there is a special place for walking meditation – OR ZAZEN – which is sitting meditation – OR LYING DOWN.”\nThese three meditations are followed by all meditators on the path of Zen. He is saying, “Leave these out and ask me something.”\nNow, Zen is not concerned with anything else. In fact, there have been cases when a new disciple comes to a master and the master almost always asks, “From where are you coming?” The authentic seeker will say, “I don’t know. I have come to you to find out from where I am coming.” This kind of disciple will be immediately accepted.\nBut instead of it he says, “From some town, some village...”\nAnd the master asks, “How much is the price of rice in that village?”\nAnd the person starts talking about the prices, not knowing that the master is trying to find out whether this man has the capacity, is made of the right stuff to be a meditator.\nOne Sufi mystic, Bayazid, went to his master for the first time. The master was staying in a mosque. Bayazid entered the mosque – he was perfectly alone, as far as you could see – but the master immediately said, “Keep the crowd out! You come alone, this is not a place for the crowd.”\nBayazid looked all around and said, “What crowd? There is no one here except me.”\nThe master said, “Don’t look around, look in. You have been carrying a whole crowd – all the friends you have left behind, your wife, your children, your parents. They had all come to say good-bye to you at the boundary of the village, but they are still in your mind. I am talking about that crowd. Just go out, and until that crowd is gone don’t come in.”\nIt took one year for Bayazid. He remained sitting outside, watching his mind, waiting for the moment when the mind was empty. The moment he found, “Now the crowd is gone,” he entered the mosque.\nThe master hugged him and told him, “My hands are small, I cannot hug a whole crowd. Now you have come alone, something is possible.”\nONCE, ISAN WAS ASKED BY ICHU TO COMPOSE A GATHA FOR HIM.\nGatha means a poem. Ordinarily that question is not right; it is asked only at the time when the master is dying. The disciples ask as a memorial, “Just write down a small poem. Your last word, in your own handwriting, will be our greatest treasure.” That last word is called gatha.\nISAN WAS ASKED BY ICHU TO COMPOSE A GATHA FOR HIM. That was so stupid a question, because Isan was not going to die.\nISAN REPLIED: “IT IS FOOLISH TO COMPOSE ONE WHEN FACE TO FACE. When I am face to\nface with you, read me, read my heart. A gatha is written when a master is dying because he will not be anymore available. It is so foolish to ask such a thing when we are face to face. Feel my presence. AND, IN ANY CASE, WRITING THINGS ON PAPER!“...\nIsan is saying, “In the first place, it is foolish when I am present not to rejoice in my presence, not to dance with my presence, not to be ecstatic and drunk with my presence. And secondly, IN ANY\nCASE, WRITING THINGS ON PAPER! – what will be their value? When you cannot understand the living master and his word, that dead paper, that dead ink – what are you going to do with it?”\nSO ICHU WENT TO KYOZAN, A DISCIPLE OF ISAN, AND MADE THE SAME REQUEST.\nIN RESPONSE, KYOZAN DREW A CIRCLE ON PAPER AND WROTE A NOTE NEXT TO IT.…\nIt is a beautiful note. He has not compiled a gatha, but he has responded in a different, unique way, in his own way.\nHe has not composed a poem; on the contrary, he DREW A CIRCLE ON THE PAPER AND WROTE A NOTE NEXT TO IT THAT SAID: “TO THINK AND THEN KNOW IS THE SECOND GRADE. NOT TO THINK AND THEN KNOW IS THE THIRD GRADE.”\nHe has left out the first grade because something has to be left for the disciple to find. What is the first grade? He says, “NOT TO THINK AND THEN KNOW IS THE THIRD GRADE. TO THINK AND THEN KNOW IS THE SECOND GRADE.”\nBut Ichu did not ask him, “What is the first grade?”\nThe first grade is just to know; no question of thinking or not thinking, but just to know.\nThe moment you enter into deep meditation you pass through many things: the thinking mind, the feeling heart. You come into a space where everything is empty, only witnessing has remained. That witnessing is the only authentic knowing; that is the first grade.\nBut Ichu went on missing. In all these sutras he could not make a single step deeper into the mystery of life, although every possibility was made available to him.\nSoseki wrote:\nDON’T ASK WHY THE PINE TREES IN THE FRONT GARDEN\nARE GNARLED AND CROOKED. THE STRAIGHTNESS\nTHEY WERE BORN WITH\nIS RIGHT THERE INSIDE THEM.\nIt is a very significant statement. You see the tree – a pine tree or any tree which is not straight for any reason. Circumstances may not have allowed it to be straight, or perhaps the gardener did not want it to be straight, but in the innermost being of the tree the possibility of being straight is still there.\nAll these poems are about you. Whatever the symbol – the fire, or the pine tree – these symbols don’t matter; they simply give you an indication.\nDON’T ASK WHY THE PINE TREES IN THE FRONT GARDEN\nARE GNARLED AND CROOKED. THE STRAIGHTNESS\nTHEY WERE BORN WITH\nIS RIGHT THERE INSIDE THEM.\nThis is exactly the case with you all. Whatever you have become, however far you have gone from your natural potential, it does not matter. Your buddha remains within you. Your straightness remains within you. You can come back home any moment you decide with totality and utter urgency. Nothing can prevent you.\nQuestion 1 Maneesha has asked:\nOUR BELOVED MASTER,\nLAST NIGHT I SAW FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT THE MIND NEED NOT BE INIMICAL TO MEDITATION. DOES WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT THE MIND ACCEPTING ENLIGHTENMENT ALSO APPLY TO ITS ACCEPTANCE BEFORE ENLIGHTENMENT, OF, FOR EXAMPLE, WITNESSING? CAN THE MIND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WITNESSING IS OFTEN MORE USEFUL THAN THINKING, AND SO JUST STEP ASIDE IN THOSE MOMENTS WITHOUT THROWING A TANTRUM?\nManeesha, it is impossible. Enlightenment has to be first. As an experience mind can understand it, and seeing its gracefulness in action can become a friend to it. But before enlightenment mind can only believe, it cannot become a friend.\nMind can only believe that there is enlightenment. At the most the belief is possible – but belief is of no use. The mind has to experience enlightenment in function, not as a belief but as activity. And the same is the case with witnessing: mind will always be against witnessing because it stops mind’s long heritage of thinking. Mind is familiar with thinking; witnessing at the most can become a thought, but it cannot become an actuality.\nYou have to put mind aside to become a witness, and obviously mind resists it. Who wants to be put aside? – and particularly from a place where the mind has been the master for centuries. And you want to put it aside for something that you don’t know what it is? Mind will not allow you to remain a witness long.\nYou can try a small experiment. Just put your wristwatch in front of you and start looking at the second hand and remain watching and witnessing. You will be surprised: not even fifteen seconds have passed and you have fallen and forgotten that you are witnessing. Some other thoughts have come. Suddenly you will awaken after a few seconds: “My God, it was only fifteen seconds!” Not even sixty seconds – one minute – can you persist in witnessing. The force and the flood of mind is too big.\nThat’s why an articulate master creates strange devices to put the mind aside without making it an enemy, because sooner or later, when you become enlightened, the same mind has to be used as a friend. It is a very useful mechanism. But in the beginning it is going to be against any effort to put it aside.\nMeditation is nothing but putting the mind aside, putting the mind out of the way, and bringing a witnessing which is always there but hidden underneath the mind. This witnessing will reach to your center, and once you have become enlightened, then there is no problem. Then bring the mind in tune with you. It is a great art. First you have to put the mind aside, then you have to bring the mind back again, but now it comes as a slave. It used to be the master before, so if you try before enlightenment, it is going to throw all kinds of tantrums. There is no need, because those tantrums will hinder your progress into witnessing. Just don’t create the enemy.\nSilently start witnessing, without making a direct attack on the mind. You have to be very careful to reach to the center. Mind will try in every way to take you away for a worldwide tour. And it allures, persuades you, gives you great promises: “Where are you going? What is there inside? The boyfriend is waiting outside the gate and you are going inside. The party is arranged in the Blue Diamond – and who has ever heard of a party inside?”\nThe mind will create many kinds of things, but you have to very lovingly and carefully put it aside. Remember my words, lovingly and carefully. Don’t hurt the mind, because the mind will be of much use after enlightenment. Before enlightenment it is your hindrance; after enlightenment it is an immensely complicated mechanism which can be used for all kinds of things. Then it is no more your enemy. Just the master has to be awakened, and once the mind sees the immense light inside you, it spontaneously falls in tune. There is no question of fighting. But before enlightenment the mind will give every fight if you are going to leave it behind or put it aside. This is simple psychology.\nGurdjieff used to say that in a class where the master has gone out, there is havoc. Children are shouting, jumping, fighting, doing whatsoever they always wanted to do, but because of the master... And then the master comes in and every child is sitting in his place looking into the book. That does not mean that he is reading; that simply means he is showing that he is occupied. There is silence.\nGurdjieff used to say that something almost similar happens when you become enlightened. The master comes in and the mind, seeing the master, suddenly recognizes what his position is. Before such a splendor he is reduced. At that moment you can make friends with the mind; he will be immensely happy to be of any service to the eternity that you have brought with you. But don’t try it before enlightenment: then the mind is going to give you unnecessary trouble. The more you will fight with the mind, the more you will be engaged in mind rather than becoming a witness.\nWitnessing is simply slipping out of the mind – a very graceful way, because the moment you start witnessing the very thought process, you have slipped out without creating any fight. You are just\nwatching the caravan of thoughts within you. You are no more part; you are standing aside, by the side of the road, and the traffic is passing. You are not in a fighting mood, you are not even judgmental. You don’t say, “This is good and that is wrong.” Whatever is passing, your whole work is just to see. Soon this silent seeing... and the mind is put aside.\nIt is witnessing that will take you to enlightenment. After enlightenment mind can be used, can be very significantly used. It is the greatest biological evolution. It has not to be thrown away in the wastepaper basket; it has to be used. But first find the master who can use it. Right now mind is using you. Everybody is a mind slave unless he is enlightened. Then enlightenment is you and mind becomes your slave.\nIt is time for Sardar Gurudayal Singh. I have found the secret of his rainbow turban: he keeps it tightly bound around his head, otherwise it will be very difficult to be patient so long. And he is very clever also, because when everybody starts throwing all kind of gibberish, that turban protects it.\nFarmer Meadow-Muffin has a barn which catches fire and burns down in the middle of the night. The next day, the insurance man, George Grabbit, comes to inspect the damage.\n“It is the company policy,” explains Grabbit, “to build a replacement barn of the same size and with the same materials, instead of paying you cash for the damage.”\n“Well, if that’s the way your company does business,” snorts the farmer, “you can cancel the insurance on my wife!”\nHerman Humpski is getting married to Hilda, his childhood sweetheart, but he is very worried because he is not sure about what to do on the wedding night.\nHe confides in his experienced friend, Kowalski, who thinks for a moment, and then comes up with an idea.\n“Listen,” says Kowalski, “no need to worry. I will take the hotel room next to your honeymoon suite, and when it is time to go to bed, just sneak into the bathroom and I will give you instructions through the wall.”\n“Great idea!” says Herman, very relieved, and the two of them go to book the hotel rooms.\nThe wedding goes fine, and at the reception the cake is served by Hilda, the bride, who manages to eat an enormous quantity of it herself.\nLater, at the honeymoon hotel, the young couple are getting ready for bed, when Herman sneaks into the bathroom, locks the door and knocks on the wall. Kowalski and Herman have difficulty in hearing each other through the wall, so the instructions take a long time.\nMeanwhile, back in the bedroom, Hilda is dying to relieve herself of the mountain of wedding cake she has eaten. She pounds on the bathroom door but Herman will not let her in.\nFinally, in desperation, she shits in a shoe box and leaves her deposit outside the bathroom door.\nSure enough, when Herman has received all Kowalski’s instructions, he flings open the bathroom door and steps right into the shoe box.\n“Ah!” cries Herman, “this box is full of shit!”\nFrom the other side of the bathroom wall, Kowalski shouts, “You idiot! Turn her over!”\nPope the Polack is shocked and horrified to learn that many of his Roman Catholic priests are catching AIDS. So, in a hopeless attempt to try and preserve Christianity, he issues an edict. The edict states that all his cardinals, bishops and priests should become married immediately – to women.\nEverything goes beautifully, and all sorts of strange and wonderful Catholic weddings take place. Of course, the biggest of them all is Pope the Polack’s own wedding to Sister Suzie, at the Vatican, in Rome.\nThe Vatican is packed with priests and politicians getting ready for the big event. And in his chambers, Pope the Polack is getting dressed in his best pope outfit, aided by his best man, Ronald Reagan.\n“Are you sure that you will be able to manage married life?” asks Reagan.\n“It should be simple, Ronnie,” replies the Polack pope, admiring himself in the mirror.\n“Yes, but you have been celibate all your life, haven’t you?” says Reagan. “Are you sure that your machinery will work?”\n“Ah! don’t worry,” replies the pope, confidently. “I tried it with my own hands last night, and now,” he adds, crossing himself, “it is in the hands of God!”\nNivedano... (Drumbeat) (Gibberish) Nivedano... (Drumbeat)\nBe silent. Close your eyes, and feel your body to be completely frozen.\nNow you are ready to go inwards with all your consciousness, with all your life energy. Move towards the center of your being. That is from where you have come and that is where everybody goes back.\nDeeper and deeper... the deeper you go, the more fragrant becomes the air. The deeper you go, suddenly flowers start showering on you. At the deepest point you are the buddha.\nThe buddha means simply witnessing, pure witnessing. Just witness: the body is there, the mind is there, but you are neither.\nYou are a separate force which comes from the center, and the center is joined with eternity. It knows no birth, no death. This buddha is your ultimate potential, the very Everest of consciousness. Great is the splendor of this moment.\nTo make it more clear, Nivedano... (Drumbeat)\nRelax, and continue to remember witnessing. Witnessing is the only thing in you that is eternal. Everything else is temporal; only witnessing is your reality, your very soul. I call it the buddha because it is a great awakening.\nThis moment the Buddha Auditorium has become a lake of consciousness without any ripples. It is such a joy to join the cosmos, such a joy for the dewdrop to disappear into the ocean.\nThe evening was beautiful in itself, but your presence and your tremendous experiment have made it a thousandfold more beautiful, more graceful. The whole existence is rejoicing because you have reached to the center of your being.\nCollect all the fragrance that you can manage. Remember, any moment you become a witness, you are a buddha. So bring the buddha with you.\nSoon Nivedano will be calling you back. Before that, collect as many treasures as possible, and persuade the buddha to come with you. It is your very innermost core, it is not something separate. It has remained hidden inside. Now you have to bring it to the circumference, to your ordinary life.\nIf we can create a great number of buddhas around the world, we can have a great transformation happening. More love, more songs, more ceremonies...\nNivedano... (Drumbeat)\nCome back, but with the grace of a buddha, silently, peacefully. Sit down for a few moments collecting the experience.\nEach day you are becoming richer and richer. Each day your circumference is coming closer to your center. Each day you are bringing buddha more and more in your day-to-day life.\nI am against renunciation. I want buddhas to be here in the world doing all kinds of things. It was unfortunate in the past that buddhas escaped from the world. If they had remained in the world, we would not have been so barbarious. More humanity and more culture and more consciousness would have been available to us.\nThat’s why I say nobody has to leave the world. We have to transform it. We are bringing a new approach in religion. You don’t go away from the world, but rather go deeper into it and change it. This is more courageous, more rebellious, more significant.\nOkay, Maneesha? Yes, Beloved Master.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"6627","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/isan_no_footprints_in_the_blue_sky/part3/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/isan_no_footprints_in_the_blue_sky/>Isan.

SEEING HIM, ISAN MADE AS IF TO GET UP. “PLEASE DON’T STAND UP!”
EXCLAIMED THE MONK.</p><p><br></p><p>“I HAVEN’T SAT DOWN YET!” SAID ISAN.</p><p><br></p><p>“I HAVEN’T BOWED YET,” THE MONK SAID. “YOU RUDE CREATURE!” COMMENTED
ISAN.</p><p>ON ANOTHER OCCASION, ISAN WAS WATCHING A BRUSH FIRE, AND ASKED HIS
DISCIPLE, DOGO, “DO YOU SEE THE FIRE?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I SEE IT,” REPLIED DOGO.</p><p><br></p><p>THE MASTER ASKED DOGO, “WHERE DOES THE FIRE COME FROM?”</p><p><br></p><p>DOGO SAID, “I WOULD LIKE YOU TO ASK ME SOMETHING THAT HAS NOTHING TO
DO WITH WALKING AROUND OR ZAZEN OR LYING DOWN” – AT WHICH ISAN LEFT OFF
TALKING AND WENT AWAY.</p><p><br></p><p>ONCE, ISAN WAS ASKED BY ICHU TO COMPOSE A GATHA FOR HIM. ISAN
REPLIED: “IT IS FOOLISH TO COMPOSE ONE WHEN FACE TO FACE – AND, IN ANY
CASE, WRITING THINGS ON PAPER!”</p><p>SO ICHU WENT TO KYOZAN, A DISCIPLE OF ISAN, AND MADE THE SAME
REQUEST.</p><p><br></p><p>IN RESPONSE, KYOZAN DREW A CIRCLE ON PAPER AND WROTE A NOTE NEXT TO
IT THAT SAID: “TO THINK AND THEN KNOW IS THE SECOND GRADE. NOT TO THINK
AND THEN KNOW IS THE THIRD GRADE.”</p><p><br></p><p>Maneesha, before discussing your sutras, a little biographical note
on Isan is essential. I say it is essential because unless you
understand the man, his background, his upbringing, his qualities, you
will not be able to grasp just the pure sutras. They are almost writings
in the air, or, if you prefer, in the water. The man who has written the
sutras or told the sutras, or managed these anecdotes, has to be
understood to understand all that is connected with him, because his
whole being covers and colors whatever he says. You cannot take it out
of context.</p><p><br></p><p>Isan is a totally different personality than Bodhidharma. Bodhidharma
was a hard master; Isan was very polite. Naturally his politeness would
affect whatever happened around him. He was a very humble person, never
tried to convert anybody, but on the contrary slipped deep down into the
forest, so nobody came to him. He felt it a little embarrassing to be
the master and degrade somebody as a follower – a very nice, very
delicate personality, the personality of a poet, of a singer, of a
dancer.</p><p><br></p><p>ISAN WAS A MELLOW AND PATIENT MASTER IN GUIDING HIS DISCIPLES TO
ATTAIN THEIR ENLIGHTENMENT.</p><p><br></p><p>He never used shouting or hitting or beating; that was not possible
for him. He was such a loving, compassionate being that to think of him
hitting the way Zen masters hit is impossible. He was very humble; hence
he had to create absolutely different devices than those of Bodhidharma
or Nansen.</p><p><br></p><p>ISAN WAS A MELLOW AND PATIENT MASTER IN GUIDING HIS DISCIPLES TO
ATTAIN THEIR ENLIGHTENMENT. UNLIKE THOSE ZEN MASTERS WHO PRECEDED HIM,
HE DID NOT USE THE STICK OR SHOUT.</p><p><br></p><p>HOWEVER, HIS MILDNESS OF MANNER WAS ONLY A VENEER FOR THE ICONOCLAST
AND REBEL WITHIN.</p><p><br></p><p>You should not understand that his humbleness was not a rebellious
quality. You should not think that his humbleness made him compromise
with the past and the traditions. He remained a great rebel against all
that goes towards preventing a person’s enlightenment.</p><p><br></p><p>So his mildness of manner was only a veneer, just a cover for the
iconoclast and rebel within. Deep down he was fire. On the surface he
was very polite. Those who came to him because of his politeness –
because there were many who were afraid of the Zen masters who would
beat, who would hit, who would suddenly jump on you; their behavior
looked so irrational. Isan looked very good compared to the other
predecessors. Although he never was interested in people, still in the
deepest forest one thousand disciples had gathered, and they had come
from such faraway places just because they had heard that Isan was not a
man to hit or slap. He was so mild and so humble and so loving.…</p><p><br></p><p>But this was only a veneer. Inside there was glowing fire. Once you
had come close to him, because of his humbleness, because of his very
friendly behavior, you were caught in the net. As you would</p><p>come closer, you would know the fiery nature of his being – but it
was too late to go back. You had fallen in love with the man. Now
whatever happens, if you have to pass through this fire, you will pass
through this fire.</p><p><br></p><p>Maneesha has brought one anecdote:</p><p><br></p><p>OUR BELOVED MASTER,</p><p><br></p><p>ON ONE OCCASION, A MONK CAME TO ISAN’S MONASTERY TO BE TAUGHT, AND,
SEEING HIM, ISAN MADE AS IF TO GET UP.</p><p><br></p><p>“PLEASE DON’T STAND UP!” EXCLAIMED THE MONK. “I HAVE NOT SAT DOWN
YET!” SAID ISAN.</p><p>When you are in the middle, it is very difficult to say whether you
are going to sit down or you are going to get up.</p><p><br></p><p>Mulla Nasruddin used to suggest to his followers that if you don’t
want to be bored by anybody, just take your umbrella and stand in the
door.</p><p><br></p><p>If the fellow is alright and you would like to welcome him, you can
say, “You came at the right time; I was just coming in.” And if the
fellow is a bore, you can say, “Excuse me, you came at a wrong time. I
am going out.” But just standing at the door with the umbrella, now it
is very difficult to decide where the man is going, whether in or out.
He is standing in the door, in the middle.</p><p><br></p><p>The same was the position: the man has come TO BE TAUGHT, AND SEEING
HIM, ISAN MADE AS IF TO GET UP. It was a strategy to know his response,
how the other man will behave. Isan was not getting up; he just made as
if he was going to get up.</p><p><br></p><p>“PLEASE DON’T STAND UP!” Because you stand up to give honor to
someone, the man naturally thought that Isan was going to honor him by
standing. “PLEASE DON’T STAND UP!” EXCLAIMED THE MONK.</p><p><br></p><p>But such was the subtle way of Isan to know about the inner mind of
man. This man looks perfectly right in saying, “PLEASE DON’T STAND UP!”
But on what grounds has he assumed that Isan should be standing up to
welcome him?</p><p><br></p><p>“I HAVEN’T SAT DOWN YET!” SAID ISAN. “What about standing up? – I was
just going to sit down. Why did you assume...?”</p><p><br></p><p>Perhaps that assumption is a deep expectation that he should be
honored. Perhaps it is unconscious, but Isan has brought it to the
surface. The man could have thought that Isan was going to sit down. He
was in the middle – both possibilities were available to him – but the
man had chosen the possibility that Isan was going to stand up. That
shows his mind – a deep longing, a desire to be honored, although he has
come only as a student to be taught.</p><p><br></p><p>Isan said, “I HAVEN’T SAT DOWN YET” – the question of standing does
not arise.</p><p>But the poor monk did not understand the subtle way: “I HAVEN’T BOWED
YET,” THE MONK SAID. “YOU RUDE CREATURE!” COMMENTED ISAN.</p><p>Very strange encounters! When Isan said, “I HAVEN’T SAT DOWN YET!”,
that was the moment to bow down and touch his feet, and to offer himself
for the discipline, for the meditation, for all his teachings.</p><p><br></p><p>Rather than taking that, he retorted – he thought as if Isan was
making a fool of him – “I HAVEN’T BOWED YET,” THE MONK SAID.</p><p><br></p><p>“YOU RUDE CREATURE!” COMMENTED ISAN. “This is not the way to be with
me. You have to be grateful to be allowed to see me. Instead of it you
are showing your ego.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I HAVEN’T BOWED YET,” he is saying. “Don’t consider that I am your
disciple or I am your student; I have not even bowed yet.” And he has
come to learn, but ego is such a subtle phenomenon that without your
knowing, it immediately asserts. The ego simply retorted, “I HAVEN’T
BOWED YET.”</p><p><br></p><p>Now, this has to be understood. There are things which should not be
said; the very moment you say them they lose all their grandeur,
gratefulness. You have to behave in a way that shows your gratitude, not
your words.</p><p><br></p><p>Bowing down is a gesture of saying, “I am ready. You can trust that I
will not misuse the time that you will give me, or the meditation or any
kind of discipline. I will not misuse it. I have come to you
whole-heartedly.” It is just a way, without words, of saying, “I am
available.”</p><p><br></p><p>But the man said instead, “I HAVEN’T BOWED YET.”</p><p><br></p><p>As if a man like Isan is in need of your gratefulness! By being
grateful to a person like Isan, you are not making him in any way
richer; on the contrary, you are becoming richer. You are learning a new
way, a new gesture and its significance.</p><p><br></p><p>In the West it never evolved that the disciple should touch the feet
of the master, and even today the Western mind thinks it really strange
– one human being touching the feet of another human being. But they
don’t know the significance of it, they don’t know the esoteric
significance of it.</p><p><br></p><p>When the disciple touches the feet of the master, it is not only what
you see, something else is happening. When the disciple touches the
feet, the master touches his head. A circle of energy is created that is
not visible to the eyes – because no energy is ever visible to you. You
only see the gesture: one is touching the feet, the other is touching
his head.</p><p><br></p><p>But the East, for at least ten thousand years, has come to know this
secret way of approaching a master. And the master will put his hand on
your head only if he feels your energy is worth it. By touching his
feet... You should remember that energy moves only from the fingers of
the hand or from the toes of the feet; energy moves from points which
are dead ends. When somebody touches his feet, the master immediately
recognizes the kind of energy. If he feels that the person has to be
accepted, is worth being worked upon, then he touches his head, and with
his hand he gives a</p><p>taste of his energy, and then both energies become a circle. And if
the circle becomes smooth great possibilities can happen.</p><p><br></p><p>But for the outsider it seems simply that one person is touching the
feet of another person. The West has not been able, even today, to
understand. Life is not what it appears from the outside; it is much
more, immensely more, on the inside.</p><p><br></p><p>The man showed an egoistic pattern of his mind. That’s why Isan had
to comment, “YOU RUDE CREATURE!” He was not accepted as a disciple.</p><p><br></p><p>To be accepted as a disciple by a great master is not a small thing.
In that very acceptance your enlightenment has come miles closer, your
liberation has taken a tremendous quantum leap. You are just on the
verge, ready, just because the master has accepted you. He accepts only
when he sees the possibility, the vulnerability, the openness. It is an
inner drama which is not visible to the eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>ON ANOTHER OCCASION, ISAN WAS WATCHING A BRUSH FIRE, AND ASKED HIS
DISCIPLE, DOGO, “DO YOU SEE THE FIRE?”</p><p><br></p><p>Now, it will look strange – the fire is there, Dogo, his disciple, is
there, Isan is sitting there. There is no reason why Dogo should be
asked, “DO YOU SEE THE FIRE?”</p><p><br></p><p>Replied Dogo, “I SEE IT.”</p><p><br></p><p>THE MASTER ASKED DOGO, “WHERE DOES THE FIRE COME FROM?”</p><p><br></p><p>DOGO SAID, “I WOULD LIKE YOU TO ASK ME SOMETHING THAT HAS NOTHING TO
DO WITH WALKING AROUND OR ZAZEN OR LYING DOWN” – AT WHICH ISAN LEFT OFF
TALKING AND WENT AWAY.</p><p><br></p><p>Dogo has closed all the doors. When Isan was asking, “DO YOU SEE THE
FIRE?” he should have been alert. When you are with a master you have to
be alert every moment. What he says must imply some greater significance
which may not appear in the words.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, it is a strange question. They both are seeing the fire; but if
the master asks, “DO YOU SEE THE FIRE?” he means many things which Dogo
is missing. He means, “Are you here?” You can be seeing the fire and yet
you may be somewhere else and the fire may be just a faraway, faded
thing. It may not be a living experience right now. If your mind is full
of thoughts, you can even miss the fire, because who is going to see it?
You have to be here – that is the point that is hidden behind the
question.</p><p><br></p><p>If Dogo had had the understanding he would have immediately thought
that the question means his mind has moved somewhere else. He must have
been thinking of other things, other worlds, other matters.</p><p><br></p><p>I have told you a story about two friends.</p><p>One morning they met. The first friend said, “You will not believe
it: last night I had a dream I had gone fishing, and I caught such big
fish that I had to carry one fish at a time. The whole night it
continued. It was strange – for years I have been fishing and I have
never found such great fish. You should have seen what a joy it
was.”</p><p><br></p><p>The other man said, “That is nothing. Last night I dreamed that in my
bedroom, in my bed itself, on one side was Marilyn Monroe, utterly
naked, on the other side Sophia Loren, utterly naked. I was greatly
shocked. I had never believed that this chance would arise in my
lifetime.”</p><p><br></p><p>The first friend said, “You idiot! Why did you not call me?”</p><p><br></p><p>The second man said, “I did call, but your wife said you had gone
fishing!”</p><p><br></p><p>People seem to be somewhere, but their minds may be anywhere. To be
in the moment is a clear-cut message of Zen.</p><p><br></p><p>Isan’s asking Dogo, “DO YOU SEE THE FIRE?” certainly meant that Dogo
was not there. He was just sitting there but his mind had roamed away.
It would have been right for him to say, “I don’t see it, because I have
gone into my thoughts somewhere else.” But rather than telling the truth
he said, “I SEE IT.”</p><p><br></p><p>THE MASTER ASKED DOGO, “If you see it, can you tell me WHERE DOES THE
FIRE COME FROM?” Now he is asking, from where do all things come – the
fire is only a symbol – and where do they go finally? What is the source
from which they arise and what is the point where they disappear?</p><p><br></p><p>To the meditator it becomes slowly clear that the source and the goal
are one. The same point is the source; the energy moves in a circle, and
comes back to the same point. You are at the same point both the times –
when you are born and when you die. You may have changed much meanwhile
– so much experience, so much knowledge – that’s why you miss the pure
innocence of death. You missed the innocence of birth because of your
ignorance, and you miss the innocence of death because of your
knowledge.</p><p><br></p><p>Of course you were not expected to recognize innocence in your birth,
you can be forgiven for that; you were not told or taught. The
experience was so new, you could not name it even. But the man who dies
full of knowledge again misses the innocence, because of his
knowledgeability.</p><p><br></p><p>In mystic circles around the world it has been a long-standing
understanding that unless a man is just like his birth-innocence when he
dies, he missed the whole point and the whole dance of life, he missed
the whole significance of life. He has taken a long route of seventy or
eighty years, and has come back to the source, but missed it again.</p><p><br></p><p>In India, the word for the experience of this circle, the word that
is used is sansar. Sansar means both the world and the circle. The whole
world is a circular experience. In the beginning you are innocent; you
should be innocent at the end. Then your life has been a great life of
love, of understanding, of many flowers, of many blessings. You have not
lived insanely, you have lived intelligently, you have lived
meditatively; you have lived out of silence, not out of anxiety,
anguish, and thoughts.</p><p>A man is complete only when at the moment of his death he is again
the same as he was when he was born, again a child – the second
childhood.</p><p><br></p><p>So when Dogo was asked by the master, “WHERE DOES THE FIRE COME
FROM?” the fire was just an excuse. He was asking, “From where do things
come and where do they go?”</p><p><br></p><p>But Dogo again missed. Rather than answering the question, DOGO SAID,
“I WOULD LIKE YOU TO ASK ME SOMETHING THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH
WALKING AROUND OR ZAZEN OR LYING DOWN” – AT WHICH ISAN LEFT OFF TALKING
AND WENT AWAY.</p><p><br></p><p>Dogo has closed all the doors. He is saying, “You should ask me
something which is not concerned with zazen – that is intense meditation
– or a walking meditation, or a lying down meditation.”</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha used all actions in life as an opportunity to meditate.
Walking, you should walk meditatively, each step with full awareness.
Lying down, you should lie down with awareness, not just out of old
habit. And zazen is the intense and urgent quality of
meditativeness.</p><p><br></p><p>Dogo is saying to his master, who has asked, “WHERE DOES THE FIRE
COME FROM?”... He has not answered the question because that question
implies meditation. Only in meditation can you know that everything
comes from the same source and goes back to the same eternity. Nothing
ever dies, nothing ever is born; everything is, only forms go on
changing. What was sometime before wood, is now fire; what is fire soon
will be smoke.</p><p><br></p><p>These are the ways of disappearing into the ultimate reality. The
fire was hidden, so long remained hidden in the tree. Now it has
blossomed, just as flowers blossom; it has come out of the prison. A
little dance, a little joyful life, and the fire will turn into smoke.
Smoke will have a little joyful life, and slowly slowly will disappear
into the eternal. This implies a meditative experience.</p><p><br></p><p>Rather than answering it, because only a meditator can answer from
where the fire comes... Unless you know your own center, how can you
answer from where your fire comes? Your life is a fire, and where does
it go finally? Does it disappear outside or does it again relapse into
the origin? Only the meditator has known the secrets of inner life. Life
sometimes is dormant in the center and sometimes comes to the
circumference, and when tired goes back to the center.</p><p><br></p><p>One of the greatest men in history was Patanjali, who created a whole
science of yoga single- handed. It is very difficult to create a whole
science alone. Five thousand years have passed and not a single word has
been added, it has such a completion; neither has a single word been
taken out. The system is so complete in itself, there is no possibility
to go beyond Patanjali as far as yoga is concerned.</p><p><br></p><p>But only people who will go deeper into themselves will know that
they are carrying the source and the goal both at the same center.
Everything comes from the same center of the universe and goes back
finally into the same center.</p><p><br></p><p>But rather than answering the question – perhaps he was not able to
answer it – on the contrary, he was closing all doors. He was saying, “I
WOULD LIKE YOU TO ASK ME SOMETHING THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH WALKING –
because in Zen monasteries there is a special place for walking
meditation – OR ZAZEN – which is sitting meditation – OR LYING
DOWN.”</p><p>These three meditations are followed by all meditators on the path of
Zen. He is saying, “Leave these out and ask me something.”</p><p><br></p><p>Now, Zen is not concerned with anything else. In fact, there have
been cases when a new disciple comes to a master and the master almost
always asks, “From where are you coming?” The authentic seeker will say,
“I don’t know. I have come to you to find out from where I am coming.”
This kind of disciple will be immediately accepted.</p><p><br></p><p>But instead of it he says, “From some town, some village...”</p><p><br></p><p>And the master asks, “How much is the price of rice in that
village?”</p><p><br></p><p>And the person starts talking about the prices, not knowing that the
master is trying to find out whether this man has the capacity, is made
of the right stuff to be a meditator.</p><p><br></p><p>One Sufi mystic, Bayazid, went to his master for the first time. The
master was staying in a mosque. Bayazid entered the mosque – he was
perfectly alone, as far as you could see – but the master immediately
said, “Keep the crowd out! You come alone, this is not a place for the
crowd.”</p><p><br></p><p>Bayazid looked all around and said, “What crowd? There is no one here
except me.”</p><p><br></p><p>The master said, “Don’t look around, look in. You have been carrying
a whole crowd – all the friends you have left behind, your wife, your
children, your parents. They had all come to say good-bye to you at the
boundary of the village, but they are still in your mind. I am talking
about that crowd. Just go out, and until that crowd is gone don’t come
in.”</p><p><br></p><p>It took one year for Bayazid. He remained sitting outside, watching
his mind, waiting for the moment when the mind was empty. The moment he
found, “Now the crowd is gone,” he entered the mosque.</p><p><br></p><p>The master hugged him and told him, “My hands are small, I cannot hug
a whole crowd. Now you have come alone, something is possible.”</p><p><br></p><p>ONCE, ISAN WAS ASKED BY ICHU TO COMPOSE A GATHA FOR HIM.</p><p><br></p><p>Gatha means a poem. Ordinarily that question is not right; it is
asked only at the time when the master is dying. The disciples ask as a
memorial, “Just write down a small poem. Your last word, in your own
handwriting, will be our greatest treasure.” That last word is called
gatha.</p><p><br></p><p>ISAN WAS ASKED BY ICHU TO COMPOSE A GATHA FOR HIM. That was so stupid
a question, because Isan was not going to die.</p><p><br></p><p>ISAN REPLIED: “IT IS FOOLISH TO COMPOSE ONE WHEN FACE TO FACE. When I
am face to</p><p>face with you, read me, read my heart. A gatha is written when a
master is dying because he will not be anymore available. It is so
foolish to ask such a thing when we are face to face. Feel my presence.
AND, IN ANY CASE, WRITING THINGS ON PAPER!“...</p><p><br></p><p>Isan is saying, “In the first place, it is foolish when I am present
not to rejoice in my presence, not to dance with my presence, not to be
ecstatic and drunk with my presence. And secondly, IN ANY</p><p>CASE, WRITING THINGS ON PAPER! – what will be their value? When you
cannot understand the living master and his word, that dead paper, that
dead ink – what are you going to do with it?”</p><p><br></p><p>SO ICHU WENT TO KYOZAN, A DISCIPLE OF ISAN, AND MADE THE SAME
REQUEST.</p><p><br></p><p>IN RESPONSE, KYOZAN DREW A CIRCLE ON PAPER AND WROTE A NOTE NEXT TO
IT.…</p><p><br></p><p>It is a beautiful note. He has not compiled a gatha, but he has
responded in a different, unique way, in his own way.</p><p><br></p><p>He has not composed a poem; on the contrary, he DREW A CIRCLE ON THE
PAPER AND WROTE A NOTE NEXT TO IT THAT SAID: “TO THINK AND THEN KNOW IS
THE SECOND GRADE. NOT TO THINK AND THEN KNOW IS THE THIRD GRADE.”</p><p><br></p><p>He has left out the first grade because something has to be left for
the disciple to find. What is the first grade? He says, “NOT TO THINK
AND THEN KNOW IS THE THIRD GRADE. TO THINK AND THEN KNOW IS THE SECOND
GRADE.”</p><p><br></p><p>But Ichu did not ask him, “What is the first grade?”</p><p><br></p><p>The first grade is just to know; no question of thinking or not
thinking, but just to know.</p><p><br></p><p>The moment you enter into deep meditation you pass through many
things: the thinking mind, the feeling heart. You come into a space
where everything is empty, only witnessing has remained. That witnessing
is the only authentic knowing; that is the first grade.</p><p><br></p><p>But Ichu went on missing. In all these sutras he could not make a
single step deeper into the mystery of life, although every possibility
was made available to him.</p><p><br></p><p>Soseki wrote:</p><p><br></p><p>DON’T ASK WHY THE PINE TREES IN THE FRONT GARDEN</p><p>ARE GNARLED AND CROOKED. THE STRAIGHTNESS</p><p>THEY WERE BORN WITH</p><p><br></p><p>IS RIGHT THERE INSIDE THEM.</p><p><br></p><p>It is a very significant statement. You see the tree – a pine tree or
any tree which is not straight for any reason. Circumstances may not
have allowed it to be straight, or perhaps the gardener did not want it
to be straight, but in the innermost being of the tree the possibility
of being straight is still there.</p><p>All these poems are about you. Whatever the symbol – the fire, or the
pine tree – these symbols don’t matter; they simply give you an
indication.</p><p><br></p><p>DON’T ASK WHY THE PINE TREES IN THE FRONT GARDEN</p><p>ARE GNARLED AND CROOKED. THE STRAIGHTNESS</p><p>THEY WERE BORN WITH</p><p><br></p><p>IS RIGHT THERE INSIDE THEM.</p><p><br></p><p>This is exactly the case with you all. Whatever you have become,
however far you have gone from your natural potential, it does not
matter. Your buddha remains within you. Your straightness remains within
you. You can come back home any moment you decide with totality and
utter urgency. Nothing can prevent you.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 1 Maneesha has asked:</p><p>OUR BELOVED MASTER,</p><p><br></p><p>LAST NIGHT I SAW FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT THE MIND NEED NOT BE
INIMICAL TO MEDITATION. DOES WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT THE MIND ACCEPTING
ENLIGHTENMENT ALSO APPLY TO ITS ACCEPTANCE BEFORE ENLIGHTENMENT, OF, FOR
EXAMPLE, WITNESSING? CAN THE MIND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WITNESSING IS OFTEN
MORE USEFUL THAN THINKING, AND SO JUST STEP ASIDE IN THOSE MOMENTS
WITHOUT THROWING A TANTRUM?</p><p><br></p><p>Maneesha, it is impossible. Enlightenment has to be first. As an
experience mind can understand it, and seeing its gracefulness in action
can become a friend to it. But before enlightenment mind can only
believe, it cannot become a friend.</p><p><br></p><p>Mind can only believe that there is enlightenment. At the most the
belief is possible – but belief is of no use. The mind has to experience
enlightenment in function, not as a belief but as activity. And the same
is the case with witnessing: mind will always be against witnessing
because it stops mind’s long heritage of thinking. Mind is familiar with
thinking; witnessing at the most can become a thought, but it cannot
become an actuality.</p><p><br></p><p>You have to put mind aside to become a witness, and obviously mind
resists it. Who wants to be put aside? – and particularly from a place
where the mind has been the master for centuries. And you want to put it
aside for something that you don’t know what it is? Mind will not allow
you to remain a witness long.</p><p>You can try a small experiment. Just put your wristwatch in front of
you and start looking at the second hand and remain watching and
witnessing. You will be surprised: not even fifteen seconds have passed
and you have fallen and forgotten that you are witnessing. Some other
thoughts have come. Suddenly you will awaken after a few seconds: “My
God, it was only fifteen seconds!” Not even sixty seconds – one minute –
can you persist in witnessing. The force and the flood of mind is too
big.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why an articulate master creates strange devices to put the
mind aside without making it an enemy, because sooner or later, when you
become enlightened, the same mind has to be used as a friend. It is a
very useful mechanism. But in the beginning it is going to be against
any effort to put it aside.</p><p><br></p><p>Meditation is nothing but putting the mind aside, putting the mind
out of the way, and bringing a witnessing which is always there but
hidden underneath the mind. This witnessing will reach to your center,
and once you have become enlightened, then there is no problem. Then
bring the mind in tune with you. It is a great art. First you have to
put the mind aside, then you have to bring the mind back again, but now
it comes as a slave. It used to be the master before, so if you try
before enlightenment, it is going to throw all kinds of tantrums. There
is no need, because those tantrums will hinder your progress into
witnessing. Just don’t create the enemy.</p><p><br></p><p>Silently start witnessing, without making a direct attack on the
mind. You have to be very careful to reach to the center. Mind will try
in every way to take you away for a worldwide tour. And it allures,
persuades you, gives you great promises: “Where are you going? What is
there inside? The boyfriend is waiting outside the gate and you are
going inside. The party is arranged in the Blue Diamond – and who has
ever heard of a party inside?”</p><p><br></p><p>The mind will create many kinds of things, but you have to very
lovingly and carefully put it aside. Remember my words, lovingly and
carefully. Don’t hurt the mind, because the mind will be of much use
after enlightenment. Before enlightenment it is your hindrance; after
enlightenment it is an immensely complicated mechanism which can be used
for all kinds of things. Then it is no more your enemy. Just the master
has to be awakened, and once the mind sees the immense light inside you,
it spontaneously falls in tune. There is no question of fighting. But
before enlightenment the mind will give every fight if you are going to
leave it behind or put it aside. This is simple psychology.</p><p><br></p><p>Gurdjieff used to say that in a class where the master has gone out,
there is havoc. Children are shouting, jumping, fighting, doing
whatsoever they always wanted to do, but because of the master... And
then the master comes in and every child is sitting in his place looking
into the book. That does not mean that he is reading; that simply means
he is showing that he is occupied. There is silence.</p><p><br></p><p>Gurdjieff used to say that something almost similar happens when you
become enlightened. The master comes in and the mind, seeing the master,
suddenly recognizes what his position is. Before such a splendor he is
reduced. At that moment you can make friends with the mind; he will be
immensely happy to be of any service to the eternity that you have
brought with you. But don’t try it before enlightenment: then the mind
is going to give you unnecessary trouble. The more you will fight with
the mind, the more you will be engaged in mind rather than becoming a
witness.</p><p><br></p><p>Witnessing is simply slipping out of the mind – a very graceful way,
because the moment you start witnessing the very thought process, you
have slipped out without creating any fight. You are just</p><p>watching the caravan of thoughts within you. You are no more part;
you are standing aside, by the side of the road, and the traffic is
passing. You are not in a fighting mood, you are not even judgmental.
You don’t say, “This is good and that is wrong.” Whatever is passing,
your whole work is just to see. Soon this silent seeing... and the mind
is put aside.</p><p><br></p><p>It is witnessing that will take you to enlightenment. After
enlightenment mind can be used, can be very significantly used. It is
the greatest biological evolution. It has not to be thrown away in the
wastepaper basket; it has to be used. But first find the master who can
use it. Right now mind is using you. Everybody is a mind slave unless he
is enlightened. Then enlightenment is you and mind becomes your
slave.</p><p><br></p><p>It is time for Sardar Gurudayal Singh. I have found the secret of his
rainbow turban: he keeps it tightly bound around his head, otherwise it
will be very difficult to be patient so long. And he is very clever
also, because when everybody starts throwing all kind of gibberish, that
turban protects it.</p><p><br></p><p>Farmer Meadow-Muffin has a barn which catches fire and burns down in
the middle of the night. The next day, the insurance man, George
Grabbit, comes to inspect the damage.</p><p>“It is the company policy,” explains Grabbit, “to build a replacement
barn of the same size and with the same materials, instead of paying you
cash for the damage.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, if that’s the way your company does business,” snorts the
farmer, “you can cancel the insurance on my wife!”</p><p><br></p><p>Herman Humpski is getting married to Hilda, his childhood sweetheart,
but he is very worried because he is not sure about what to do on the
wedding night.</p><p><br></p><p>He confides in his experienced friend, Kowalski, who thinks for a
moment, and then comes up with an idea.</p><p><br></p><p>“Listen,” says Kowalski, “no need to worry. I will take the hotel
room next to your honeymoon suite, and when it is time to go to bed,
just sneak into the bathroom and I will give you instructions through
the wall.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Great idea!” says Herman, very relieved, and the two of them go to
book the hotel rooms.</p><p><br></p><p>The wedding goes fine, and at the reception the cake is served by
Hilda, the bride, who manages to eat an enormous quantity of it
herself.</p><p><br></p><p>Later, at the honeymoon hotel, the young couple are getting ready for
bed, when Herman sneaks into the bathroom, locks the door and knocks on
the wall. Kowalski and Herman have difficulty in hearing each other
through the wall, so the instructions take a long time.</p><p><br></p><p>Meanwhile, back in the bedroom, Hilda is dying to relieve herself of
the mountain of wedding cake she has eaten. She pounds on the bathroom
door but Herman will not let her in.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, in desperation, she shits in a shoe box and leaves her
deposit outside the bathroom door.</p><p>Sure enough, when Herman has received all Kowalski’s instructions, he
flings open the bathroom door and steps right into the shoe box.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah!” cries Herman, “this box is full of shit!”</p><p><br></p><p>From the other side of the bathroom wall, Kowalski shouts, “You
idiot! Turn her over!”</p><p><br></p><p>Pope the Polack is shocked and horrified to learn that many of his
Roman Catholic priests are catching AIDS. So, in a hopeless attempt to
try and preserve Christianity, he issues an edict. The edict states that
all his cardinals, bishops and priests should become married immediately
– to women.</p><p><br></p><p>Everything goes beautifully, and all sorts of strange and wonderful
Catholic weddings take place. Of course, the biggest of them all is Pope
the Polack’s own wedding to Sister Suzie, at the Vatican, in Rome.</p><p><br></p><p>The Vatican is packed with priests and politicians getting ready for
the big event. And in his chambers, Pope the Polack is getting dressed
in his best pope outfit, aided by his best man, Ronald Reagan.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you sure that you will be able to manage married life?” asks
Reagan.</p><p><br></p><p>“It should be simple, Ronnie,” replies the Polack pope, admiring
himself in the mirror.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, but you have been celibate all your life, haven’t you?” says
Reagan. “Are you sure that your machinery will work?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah! don’t worry,” replies the pope, confidently. “I tried it with my
own hands last night, and now,” he adds, crossing himself, “it is in the
hands of God!”</p><p><br></p><p>Nivedano... (Drumbeat) (Gibberish) Nivedano... (Drumbeat)</p><p>Be silent. Close your eyes, and feel your body to be completely
frozen.</p><p><br></p><p>Now you are ready to go inwards with all your consciousness, with all
your life energy. Move towards the center of your being. That is from
where you have come and that is where everybody goes back.</p><p><br></p><p>Deeper and deeper... the deeper you go, the more fragrant becomes the
air. The deeper you go, suddenly flowers start showering on you. At the
deepest point you are the buddha.</p><p>The buddha means simply witnessing, pure witnessing. Just witness:
the body is there, the mind is there, but you are neither.</p><p><br></p><p>You are a separate force which comes from the center, and the center
is joined with eternity. It knows no birth, no death. This buddha is
your ultimate potential, the very Everest of consciousness. Great is the
splendor of this moment.</p><p><br></p><p>To make it more clear, Nivedano... (Drumbeat)</p><p>Relax, and continue to remember witnessing. Witnessing is the only
thing in you that is eternal. Everything else is temporal; only
witnessing is your reality, your very soul. I call it the buddha because
it is a great awakening.</p><p><br></p><p>This moment the Buddha Auditorium has become a lake of consciousness
without any ripples. It is such a joy to join the cosmos, such a joy for
the dewdrop to disappear into the ocean.</p><p><br></p><p>The evening was beautiful in itself, but your presence and your
tremendous experiment have made it a thousandfold more beautiful, more
graceful. The whole existence is rejoicing because you have reached to
the center of your being.</p><p><br></p><p>Collect all the fragrance that you can manage. Remember, any moment
you become a witness, you are a buddha. So bring the buddha with
you.</p><p><br></p><p>Soon Nivedano will be calling you back. Before that, collect as many
treasures as possible, and persuade the buddha to come with you. It is
your very innermost core, it is not something separate. It has remained
hidden inside. Now you have to bring it to the circumference, to your
ordinary life.</p><p><br></p><p>If we can create a great number of buddhas around the world, we can
have a great transformation happening. More love, more songs, more
ceremonies...</p><p><br></p><p>Nivedano... (Drumbeat)</p><p>Come back, but with the grace of a buddha, silently, peacefully. Sit
down for a few moments collecting the experience.</p><p><br></p><p>Each day you are becoming richer and richer. Each day your
circumference is coming closer to your center. Each day you are bringing
buddha more and more in your day-to-day life.</p><p><br></p><p>I am against renunciation. I want buddhas to be here in the world
doing all kinds of things. It was unfortunate in the past that buddhas
escaped from the world. If they had remained in the world, we would not
have been so barbarious. More humanity and more culture and more
consciousness would have been available to us.</p><p>That’s why I say nobody has to leave the world. We have to transform
it. We are bringing a new approach in religion. You don’t go away from
the world, but rather go deeper into it and change it. This is more
courageous, more rebellious, more significant.</p><p><br></p><p>Okay, Maneesha? Yes, Beloved Master.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part2>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

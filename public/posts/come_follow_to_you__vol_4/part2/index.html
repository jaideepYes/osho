NEVERTHELESS NOT AS I WILL, BUT AS THOU WILT. 40 AND HE COMETH UNTO THE DISCIPLES, AND FINDETH THEM\nASLEEP, AND SAITH UNTO PETER: WHAT, COULD YE NOT WATCH WITH\nME ONE HOUR?\n41 WATCH AND PRAY, THAT YE ENTER NOT INTO TEMPTATION.

BEHOLD, THE HOUR IS AT HAND, AND\nTHE SON OF MAN IS BETRAYED INTO THE HANDS OF SINNERS.\n46 RISE, LET US BE GOING. BEHOLD, HE IS AT HAND THAT DOTH BETRAY\nME.\nWe are the hollow men We are the stuffed men Leaning together\nHeadpiece filled with straw. Alas! Our dried voices, when\nWe whisper together\nAre quiet and meaningless As wind in dry grass\nOr rats' feet over broken glass In our dry cellar.\nShape without form, shade without colour, Paralysed force, gesture without motion; Those who have crossed\nWith direct eyes, to death's other Kingdom Remember us -- if at all -- not as lost Violent souls, but only\nAs the hollow men The stuffed men.\nTHESE lines from T.S. Eliot are very significant, tremendously meaningful. Man, in his ignorance, is just a negative emptiness; stuffed with straw, hollow within.\nJust observe yourself. What have you gained in life? You may have lost much, but you have not gained anything. It is not only that your hands are empty, your whole being is empty. And empty not in the Buddhist sense: empty not in the sense of silence, empty not in the sense of fullness of being; but empty because the consciousness is lacking, empty because the awareness is missing. You are not a presence, you are an absence -- hollow within, stuffed with straw. That straw may be gold, it may be money; that straw may be power. A thousand and one are the names of that straw, but it is straw because it does not nourish the soul. It does not create the soul, it is destructive. At the most, it gives you a feeling of fullness, a very deceptive feeling.\nThese are the two ways to live: either to attain to true emptiness, a positive emptiness -- that is the way of meditation, prayer, the way that moves, by and by, towards God; the other way is just to go on stuffing yourself with useless, futile things, with no ultimate meaning in them. At the most, for the moment they keep you occupied. But sooner or later, one comeS to discover that one has missed the\nopportunity.\nWhen Woodrow Wilson became the President of America, the whole family was celebrating. His friends all over the country were dancing in happiness, he was crying and weeping in his room. The wife approached. She could not believe her eyes because Woodrow Wilson was sitting on his chair near the window, head leaning downwards, as sad as he had ever been seen before, with tears rolling down. With deep love the wife asked the husband,'What has happened? Why are you crying and weeping?' Helooked up with sad eyes. He said,'Now that I have become the President of the most powerful country, now that I have become the most powerful man, I realize tremendously the whole absurdity of it. Nothing is gained, and I have wasted my whole life. Now I understand the futility of power, because sooner or later, death will be coming, and I am powerless against it.'\nAnd if your power is powerless against death, then it is just a deception. Unless you attain to the deathless, your power is not power, it is a false coin.\nAnd who can attain power against death? -- one who attains to true emptiness, positive emptiness. The other name for that emptiness is deep inner fulfillment.\nYou are not filled with straw, but you are filled with your own awareness. You are not filled with furniture: cars, houses, money, and other nonsense. You are just filled with your being, the sheer am-ness, the sheer existence. Then there is no death for you. This is the last night of Jesus with his disciples, and it is very meaningful, because he will not ever be seen again. I have told you before, and it will be good to remember it again, to be reminded, that Jesus is a bridge. He is man plus God. Buddha is sheer godliness; the man has disappeared completely.\nYou cannot conceive of Buddha being sorrowful, you cannot conceive of Buddha asking anything from God. Jesus is both; that is his paradox, and his beauty. He is a bridge between these two distant phenomena: man and God -- son of man and son of God. When Jesus is praying in these sutras, his son-ship is praying to his own father-ship. Christians have missed that point completely. It is not a prayer addressed to some God in heaven; his own two polarities are in deep dialogue: Jesus as son of man in deep dialogue, communion, with Jesus as son of God. This is an inner phenomenon. Let me read you the sutra.\nTHEN COMETH JESUS WITH THEM UNTO A PLACE CALLED GETHSEMANE, AND SAITH UNTO THE DISCIPLES: SIT YE HERE,\nWHILE I GO AND PRAY YONDER.\nThese words:'Sit ye here', are exactly the meaning of what Zen people call zazen.\nZazen means: just sitting, doing nothing. When Jesus said,'Sit ye here,' he said to them:'You simply sit, don't do anything. Just remain alert, silent -- a silent pool with no ripples of thought, just sitting.' Zen people know the meaning of it, Christianity has completely forgotten. In Christianity, the very idea of just sitting has disappeared. Christian interpretations are there. They think Jesus is simply telling them to sit there. When a man like Jesus speaks, his words are not to be interpreted in an ordinary way. His language is not ordinary. The words may be ordinary, but his meaning never is. He is saying to his disciples,'Be in zazen.'\nLet me explain to you what zazen is. Zazen is a deep unoccupiedness -- not doing anything outwardly, not doing anything inwardly. It is not even meditation because when you meditate you are making some sort of effort, you are trying to do something: chanting a mantra, remembering God, or even remembering yourself. But these efforts create ripples, these efforts create vibrations and your sitting becomes corrupted. Then your sitting is not innocent.\nZazen means: sit, and just sit, nothing else. There is no doing on the part of the body, no doing on the part of the mind. It's a state of non-doing. That does not mean that you are fast asleep, because sleep is a doing. That does not mean that you are dead, because if you are dead you cannot just sit. That simply means that you are tremendously alive, intensely alive, a fire of being, but not moving anywhere -- a reservoir of energy in a deep awaiting. You are just waiting for something to happen, not even expecting, because expectation will again create a ripple of thought and the mind will start functioning. Everything is suspended.\nYou breathe, and that's all that you do. But that is not a doing, because breathing goes on its own accord. You have not to do anything but just sit silently.\nIt is said about Bodhidharma that he sat for nine years facing the wall of his cave.\nThe story says that his legs withered away. Nine years sitting silently, not doing anything: he was not chanting a mantra, he was not remembering any God, he was not doing any prayer. He was just sitting, facing a wall. His legs withered away. It is very significant, because legs are symbolic of activity, of movement.\nAll movement disappeared. Whether his legs actually withered away or not is not the point. The point is that all movement disappeared. The consciousness became an unmoving reservoir of energy, just pure energy not going anywhere.\nThen came his first disciple, because he would not accept any disciple unless he showed a tremendous intensity to follow. Hui Kujo came. It is said that he cut off his hand and offered it to Bodhidharma, and said,'Turn towards me, otherwise I will cut off my head.'\nBodhidharma had to turn. That was the first movement he had made in nine years. He said,'Wait -- so the man has come to whom I can deliver my message.'\nAgain it may or it may not be that the disciple offered his hand. Again, it is a symbol: hands mean activity. Legs mean movement, hands mean activity. With activity offered, only then is being revealed. Bodhidharma gave his message, his all, to this man who had symbolically shown that he was ready to lose activity.\nWhen Jesus said to his disciples,'Sit ye here,' he meant zazen: that,'You simply sit and wait, because a tremendous event is on the way. Something is going to happen that I will never be repeated again in the whole history of man.\nSomething unrepeatable, something unique is on the way. You wait, sit, and watch. Don't make any movement, because even a slight movement of thought, emotion, body, and you may miss the point. The son of man is going to be delivered to God. The son of man is going to disappear, and the son of God is going to appear. The greatest event ever is going to happen: sit ye here.'\nAnd the word 'here' is also very, very meaningful.'Sitting' shows: don't move in space, and 'here' shows: don't move in time. Just be here, now -- no movement in space, no movement in time. It would have been easier for the disciples --\nbecause it was late and they were tired of the whole day's celebration, activities, and they would have liked to fall asleep -- it would have been easier if they had been allowed to walk around. They would have kept awake. But Jesus said,'Sit.\nSIT HERE, don't walk around. Don't move in space and don't move in time.'\nThe body moves in space; mind moves in time. Body is part of space, mind is part of time. Jesus says,'Sit -- here.' By sitting, you stop the movement in space; by being here, just being here, you stop the movement of mind. This is the whole\nmeaning of zazen. If it can be rightly interpreted, Jesus said to his disciples: Do zazen...\n... WHILE L GO AND PRAY YONDER.\nJesus is going to pray; prayer is a bridge. The son is going to pray to the Father; the lower is going to pray to the higher; the earth is going to pray to the sky; the seed is going to pray to the tree, to the future.\nPrayer is love.\nJesus says,'I am going to offer myself to my God. Sit silently, watchful, alert' -- as watchful as the beloved awaits the lover, as alert. If anything moves, she suspects that maybe the lover has come; these may be the footsteps of the lover.… She runs to the door. It may be just a wind passing by, it may be just wind playing with the dry leaves on the street, it may be just a beggar, it may be just a stranger, but a beloved remains alert, watchful, waiting -- passionately, intensely focused.\nJesus says,'Watch ye, sit here. I am going to pray.'\nWhen a man like Jesus prays, God answers. If your prayers have not been answered, don't complain. It simply shows that you have not prayed. If your prayers have not been answered, it simply shows that you have done something else, not prayer. Prayer is a total, unconditional offering, saying,'I am yours. Thy will be done.' Jesus is going to pray. When Jesus goes to pray, the earth is going to meet the sky. If the disciples can be silently watchful, they will become witnesses to the greatest event, to a tremendous event: the sky coming down to meet the earth, the God descending to meet the son. A great phenomenon within Jesus' heart is going to happen: the polarities are going to become one, the opposites are going to meet. Rightly he said to his disciples,'Sit ye here while I go and pray yonder.'\nOne more thing, and then we can move on.\nA meditation is just sitting. A meditation is just being where you are. Prayer is a going, meditation is a sitting. In prayer you extend your being. In prayer you rise like high waves in the ocean to touch the beyond. In meditation you simply wait.\nMeditation is passive, prayer is not; prayer is active. In meditation, you simply\nopen the doors of your heart and you wait. In prayer that is not enough -- you open the doors and you run towards the height. That's why Jesus says,'While I GO and pray yonder. You meditate while I pray.'\nWhen a Master is praying, if the disciples can simply wait and meditate, much will happen to them. Because, when the love of the whole descends on the Master, it will naturally shower on the disciples also. Only a Master can pray; a disciple can only meditate. Because prayer is possible when you have known what God is. Prayer is possible when you have known the whole. Meditation is possible without knowing anything about God. In fact, for meditation, God is not needed. That's why the religions which are based on meditation are atheistic: Jainism and Buddhism are both atheistic; they don't believe in any God. There is no need. They are meditative religions: they simply sit and wait. Whenever they are ready, God comes. The religions of prayer: Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, don't just sit, they RUN towards God. They move. You can think of Buddhism or Jainism as a silent ocean with no ripples, no waves. You can think of Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, as the ocean in high tide -- great waves rising to meet the sky.\nPrayer is different from meditation: meditation is passivity, prayer is activity.\nThat's why Buddhism and Jainism teach renunciation, moving away from activity. Christianity teaches service, moving into the marketplace, going to seek and search God. But only a Master can pray, because love is possible only when you know the other. How can you call God? -- you don't know. How can you call Him 'thou'? -- you don't know. At the most, He remains a hypothesis, and a hypothesis cannot be called 'thou'. At the most it will remain 'it'; it can never become a 'thou'. It can be used, but cannot be loved. Nobody can love a mathematical theorem. Nobody can love the greatest formula there is, the Einsteinian formula: E = MC2. How can you love it? How can you call this formula 'thou'? How can you bow down before it? How can tears go on flowing from your eyes; how can you dance around it? Maybe the formula is very great, explains much, but an explanation cannot be worshipped. God, when known, is touched as you touch your beloved, kissed as you kiss your beloved, looked deep into the eyes of as you look deep into the eyes of your beloved. Unless God comes to you like a lover, prayer is not possible. Your prayer will be false.\nBut a Master can pray. When he is praying the sky descends over him, surrounds him, touches him from all over, from all dimensions. And if the disciples are just\nthere, sitting silently in deep zazen, meditating, their hearts will be thrilled. The unknown will touch them also, the unknown will penetrate their beings also.\nBecause when it rains, when God rains, it does not rain like a miser. When God rains, it rains tremendously; it fills the whole earth. Even one Jesus prays, and God rains and fills the whole earth. Wherever people are waiting silently, meditating, suddenly they will be full of Him. Then prayer becomes possible, not before it. A real touch is needed, a contact is needed. God has to be touched, one has to be touched by God; only then, trust arises.\nMeditation does not need God. You can discard the hypothesis and meditate. If you go on meditating, then one day God will fill your heart. But if you have a Master who can pray on your behalf, who can pray for you, who can simply pray, you will gain much of which you were not yet worthy.\nIt is the last night, Jesus is going to leave the next day. He would like to give them a gift, a gift of God. He said to them,'Sit ye here while I go and pray yonder.' He wants to go into deep isolation, alone, because even the presence of the disciples can be a disturbance. Meditation can be done in a group. Prayer is such an intimate phenomenon; it is a meeting of two lovers. Nobody should be a witness to it, nobody should be a bystander to it, nobody should observe it.\nOtherwise, the very fact that somebody is there will become a jarring note. Prayer is always in the alone.\nAnd look at the foolishness: people meditate alone, and pray together.\nMeditators move into loneliness, and when you want to pray you go to the church, you go to the temple and you pray together. Prayer has to be in absolute aloneness, because prayer is love. Meditation can be done in a group: it is a technique. In fact, if you meditate in a group, you will meditate deeply because the group helps, enhances. It fosters confidence. A group mind is created, a great wave of group consciousness is created and you simply move on the wave.\nBut to pray is to love. One should pray as one loves. You cannot make love in a marketplace. In the West it is happening, and because of it love is losing all meaning. It needs privacy, it needs intimacy. In the West now, love has become a public affair. In a public garden you can find lovers in deep embrace, even making love publicly. This is profane; something sacred is being destroyed.\nSomething very intimate is being made public, corrupted. The innocence will be lost.\nLove needs intimacy, love needs darkness. In fact, love needs so much aloneness that women always close their eyes while love is made to them. Even the presence of the lover, to see the lover, is a disturbance. They close their eyes, they are totally alone. Even the lover is not to be seen, otherwise the other will be there, and the presence of the other is always a tension. When the other is completely forgotten, when deep in darkness the other is lost, then love arises to its highest peak, to the greatest orgasm.\nRemember this: Jesus was trying to give them his last gift; but the gift was invisible, and the gift was such that nothing could be said about it. Only those who were capable would receive it, and those who were not capable would miss it.\nTHEN COMETH JESUS WITH THEM UNTO A PLACE CALLED\nGETHSEMANE, AND SAITH UNTO THE DISCIPLES: SIT YE HERE, WHILE I GO AND PRAY YONDER. AND HE TOOK WITH HIM PETER AND THE TWO\nSONS OF ZEBEDEE, AND BEGAN TO BE SORROWFUL AND VERY HEAVY.\nThree disciples he took with him. These three disciples were as if they were not.\nThey had lost their egos; they could be allowed to be there. Their presence would not be a jarring note because they had no presence of their own. They were like shadows of Jesus, part of his being.\n... AND BEGAN TO BE SORROWFUL AND VERY HEAVY.\nThis is the beauty of Jesus, that he can be sorrowful. A Buddha cannot be. Jesus is more flowing; he can comprehend the opposites.\nI have heard about one great Zen Master, Lin Chi. Somebody asked,'You have become enlightened. Tell us something: what has happened to you after enlightenment?'\nHe laughed and he said,'I was miserable before enlightenment. Enlightenment has happened, and I am miserable yet.'\nIt is very difficult to understand what he means to say. He is saying that enlightenment is not going to destroy the polarity. Rather, on the contrary, enlightenment is going to create a higher synthesis of the paradox, of the polarity. It is not that an enlightened man does not become sad, but that he becomes sad in a different way. His sadness has a totally different quality to it.\nHis sadness is happier than your happiness. His sadness has a depth, his sadness has a beauty -- a silent song without any sounds.\n... AND BEGAN TO BE SORROWFUL AND VERY HEAVY.\nThis is the son of man who began to be sorrowful, because soon this shore had to be left. The ship had arrived, and no more would he be here. But why is he sorrowful? -- because he is son of man, he belongs to this earth also. He is not only the sky. He would have to leave this earth, and he had loved this earth also, he had loved this body also. His love was great enough to comprehend all. He had enjoyed a thousand and one enjoyments. He delighted here; he was not an ascetic. He was celebrating life here; and now, no more of that celebration, no more of that delight. No more would he again be able to sing that song of the earth. Jesus was a very earth-rooted man.\nTHEN SAITH HE UNTO THEM: MY SOUL IS EXCEEDING SORROWFUL, EVEN UNTO DEATH. TARRY YE HERE, AND WATCH WITH ME.\nTo these three disciples he said,'My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, my cup of sorrow is overflowing.' He is like a river that is going to fall into the ocean. The river hesitates; it looks backwards -- all those beautiful terrains, those beautiful Himalayas far off, those glaciers, those peaks: the trees, the forest, the banks, the people -- millions of experiences. Now, within a minute, everything would be ended. The river wants to linger a little on the verge before falling into the ocean and disappearing. The river hesitates. The speed slows down; it looks backwards, full of nostalgia. This is what was happening to Jesus. He had lived, and he lived profoundly. His true life has not been said, because Christians are afraid. They have made an ascetic out of him. He was not. He loved eating, he loved wine, he loved women; he loved the small joys of life. He was a man very much of this earth, plus. The earth was not denied, the earth was made holy in\nhim. The earth was not rejected, the earth was celebrated as a gift of God.\nBuddha is different. He would not look when his river was going to fall, he would not look backwards. In fact, his speed would be increased: this is the ocean for which he had been waiting and longing. He would really jump into the ocean. He would not even give a 'thank you' to the earth.\nJesus is different; their personalities are different. And it is good that life produces different types of buddhas. Life is richer for it -- so many types of flowers with such different fragrances. Life is not monotonous. Life does not produce buddhas as a Ford factory produces Ford cars. Each buddha is unique.\nBuddha has his own beauty, the beauty of the sky. Epicurus has his own beauty, the beauty of the earth. And Jesus is something: Epicurus plus Buddha -- the beauty of this earth and of that sky -- a great synthesis, an infinite harmony.\nMY SOUL IS EXCEEDING SORROWFUL, -- EVEN UNTO DEATH. TARRY YE\nHERE, AND WATCH WITH ME.\nHe had left the other disciples a little behind. He told them to sit quietly, to be in zazen, to meditate. He had brought the closest ones near him, and he said to them,'Tarry ye here, and watch with me' -- move around near me, and be watchful. Why this difference? Why could he not bring all of the disciples close?\nOnly those can be allowed to be very close who have almost disappeared. They will not be a disturbance.'Tarry ye here, and watch with me' -- something tremendous is on the way; be watchful.\nAND HE WENT A LITTLE FARTHER, AND FELL ON HIS FACE... the earth\nthat he loved too much. He fell on the earth... AND PRAYED, SAYING: O MY FATHER, IF IT BE POSSIBLE, LET THIS CUP PASS FROM ME.\nThis is the son of man, the helpless man, the helpless earth, the earth speaking to the sky,'Oh Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me.' Jesus would have liked to live a little longer. Jesus would not have liked to leave this earth so soon; he loved it.\nNEVERTHELESS, NOT AS I WILL, BUT AS THOU WILT.\nThese two trends are continuously in him. The earth part says,'If it be possible, oh my God, oh my Father, let this cup pass from me. Don't force me to fall into the ocean so soon.' But the other part, the son of God, the other polarity of his being, says,'Nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt.'\nAND HE COMETH UNTO THE DISCIPLES AND FINDETH THEM ASLEEP, AND SAITH UNTO PETER: WHAT, COULD YE NOT WATCH WITH ME ONE\nHOUR? -- because when he prayed, the earth and the sky met. When he prayed, the son and the God met. When he prayed, a great symphony arose within him where the son of man was no more separate from the son of God. His body and soul danced together in a mysterious harmony.\nAND HE COMETH UNTO THE DISCIPLES AND FINDETH THEM ASLEEP...\nThey missed.\nThere are gifts which cannot be given to you until you are ready to receive them.\nThere are gifts which can be given to you whether you are ready to receive them or not, and those are the gifts of the world. There are gifts which can be given to you only when you are ready to receive them -- those are the gifts of the invisible, of the other world, of the other shore. Jesus created a situation, but the disciples missed.\n... AND FINDETH THEM ASLEEP, AND SAITH UNTO PETER: WHAT,\nCOULD YE NOT WATCH WITH ME ONE HOUR? -- is sleep that important?\nCould you not remain alert and aware for only one hour? WATCH AND PRAY, THAT YE ENTER NOT INTO TEMPTATION. THE SPIRIT INDEED IS\nWILLING, BUT THE FLESH IS WEAK. He said to them again... the compassion of a Master is infinite! You go on missing, and he goes on giving to you.\nWATCH AND PRAY, THAT YE ENTER NOT INTO TEMPTATION. THE\nSPIRIT INDEED IS WILLING, BUT THE FLESH IS WEAK. Deep down, who\nis not willing? But on the surface is the problem. Deep down, you would like to attain to truth, but the surface, the flesh, is unwilling.\nHE WENT AWAY AGAIN THE SECOND TIME, AND PRAYED, SAYING: O\nMY FATHER, IF THIS CUP MAY NOT PASS AWAY FROM ME, EXCEPT I DRINK IT, THY WILL BE DONE.\nAgain he said the same prayer. Why did Jesus repeat these prayers? It was not for himself. For himself, once was enough. Twice, thrice he repeated them, for the disciples. He was trying to transfer the key. He was ready to give them the greatest science, the science of how to get out of their imprisonments. But they wouldn't listen, they wouldn't understand. They thought,'One hour's sleep is far better than being alert.'\nAnd remember, this is the case with you, and with everybody. You can miss a meditation just because in the morning you are feeling a little too lazy and too sleepy. And who knows? -- that meditation could have been a conversion.\nNobody knows. You may have missed something, and you will never become aware that you missed. Your sleep is really deep. You live an almost unconscious life.\nI will tell you one story I was reading.\nA lion was captured and placed in a large yard surrounded by a high fence. He soon became acquainted with the social life of the other lions who had been there a long time. The lions had divided themselves into several clubs: political, religious, and others, each with its own activities, philosophies, dogmas, scriptures, ideologies. One group met regularly to hate and slander the captors, that was their whole activity -- as if just by hating and slandering the captors something was going to happen. Another group met to sing sentimentally about a future jungle having no fences. They must have been utopian, imaginary people who live in fantasy. They depicted a future jungle with no fences, in beautiful colors, and they sang about it in as beautiful poetry as possible. They must have been very romantic, utopian, imaginary people. And a third group met to secretly plan violence against the other groups, to plot violence against the\nother groups. Those were the conspirators; they were not so much against the captors as they were against the other groups of lions.\nEach club tried to pressure the newcomer into joining, but something held him back. His hesitation was caused by observing one particular lion who kept to himself, and who seemed always to be in deep thought and meditation. And this lion who used to be alone, a loner, attracted the newcomer. He had some quality of magnetism around him: a certain power, a certain magic. The newcomer shyly approached the solitary lion and requested an explanation of his apartness. The very apartness must have given him a quality of charisma, a glow around him.\nBecause people who live in crowds lose their individuality and their charisma; people who live alone always gather around them an aura of authority, of majesty. This loner looked like a king. He had something of the imperial in him.\n'Join nothing!' replied the lion, the meditator.'These foolish creatures do everything but the necessary. I am doing what is essential, so one day I will be out of here. You are welcome to all the facts I have uncovered.'\n'But what is this necessary thing that you are doing?' asked the newcomer.\n'Listen carefully,' said the loner, the meditator lion.'I am studying the nature of the fence. That is the only essential thing to do in life: to understand the nature of the fence.'\nWhere is your fence? Where are the walls of your prison? -- in your sleep, in your unconsciousness, in your behavior like a robot's. That's what Jesus was trying to show his disciples that night:'If you can be alert, you will be free.' Awareness is freedom, sleepiness is bondage. But even on that last night, the night of departure -- and these disciples will repent for centuries, and in their repentance they will worship Jesus, and they will create millions of churches for him -- when he was alive and he was departing, they were not even able to do that much for his sake: to be alert and watchful for a few hours.\nAND HE CAME AND FOUND THEM ASLEEP AGAIN, FOR THEIR EYES WERE HEAVY. AND HE LEFT THEM., AND WENT AWAY AGAIN, AND PRAYED THE THIRD TIME, SAYING THE SAME WORDS.\nWhy did he do it the third time? He didn't wake them the third time; the compassion of a Master is infinite. He understood that it was impossible for them to be awake, so he tried to pray:'Let it be so, that they are fast asleep. But if God showers, even in their unconsciousness some seed may fall, even in their sleep they may hear something. Even fast asleep they may come to know something that they are unaware of; they may carry some quality.' Much would have been possible if they had been aware and alert, but that seemed impossible. He had tried twice. The hours were passing fast; soon he would be betrayed, caught and killed:'No time is to be lost. Let them sleep.'\nMany times, the same happens: here, I go on looking into your faces; you seem to be listening to me, but you rarely listen. You are more or less asleep. But I go on; I go on calling you, provoking you. Maybe even if a word falls deep down into you, even while you are asleep, that seed will some -- day bring fruit. Much would have been possible, much was available, but you were not present.\nJust the other day I was telling you that Buddha gave his flower to Mahakashyap, Jesus gave bread and wine to his disciples. And I told you that Buddha chose a flower because a flower is the most unearthly thing on the earth.\nSo elusive is the beauty of the flower. In the morning it is there; by the evening, gone. It looks like a dream; it does not look material. It can be crushed, destroyed so easily; it gives no resistance. How it exists is a miracle. A rose flower -- how does it exist in this world of stones and rocks? It is a miracle; it is something from the beyond. Buddha chose the flower. Jesus chooses bread -- very ordinary, common; and wine, even more earthly. It is good, because he loved the earth. But there is one thing that I must tell you: when Buddha gave the flower to Mahakashyap, the flower was received in perfect awareness. When Buddha gave the flower, Mahakashyap was totally alert and aware. But when Jesus gave the bread and the wine, to whom did he give them? They were not like Mahakashyap; they were not so aware. It was given to them out of Jesus'\ncompassion. When Buddha gave to Mahakashyap, Mahakashyap had earned it; it was not simply out of Buddha's compassion. Of course the compassion was there, but Mahakashyap had earned it. He was ready to receive it.\nIn Jesus' case, there is only compassion, pure compassion. Those disciples were not yet ready. But the time had come for Jesus to leave; he gave them something they would become aware of only after many lives. He gave them the key to a\ntreasure. They might not open it for lives, but the key would remain with them in their unconscious. Some day, whenever they become alert, they will be able to use the key.\nIt is said by Zen people that whatsoever was given to Mahakashyap was beyond scripture, beyond words, beyond knowledge. Let it be said about Jesus also: that whatsoever he gave was not only beyond scripture and beyond words, it was also beyond consciousness. He gave to them in their unconsciousness. They were asleep, and his time had come. He simply gave the key, closed their fists, and withdrew to his eternal home. Some day, whenever their morning comes and they open their eyes, they will find the key in their hands.\nAND HE LEFT THEM, AND WENT AWAY AGAIN, AND PRAYED THE THIRD TIME, SAYING THE SAME WORDS. THEN COMETH HE TO HIS DISCIPLES, AND SAITH UNTO THEM: SLEEP ON NOW -- now you can\nsleep as much as you like, because the moment has been missed. Now you\ncannot miss anything by sleeping -- AND TAKE YOUR REST. BEHOLD, THE HOUR IS AT\nHAND, AND THE SON OF MAN IS BETRAYED INTO THE HANDS OF\nSINNERS. RISE, LET US BE GOING. BEHOLD, HE IS AT HAND THAT DOTH\nBETRAY ME.\nThe crowd was approaching with Judas leading it. In the dark night their footsteps could be heard, their torches could be seen. And Jesus said -- he must have said it in deep sadness -- 'Sleep on now, take your rest'; because one who was disturbing your sleep now has to be moving. The one who was trying to disturb your dreams, and your sleep, and your rest, has been betrayed, and the enemy is approaching.'RISE, LET US BE GOING. BEHOLD, HE IS AT HAND\nTHAT DOTH BETRAY ME.'\nThis sentence is very pregnant. Jesus could have waited there; the enemy was approaching. But the story says that he walked towards the enemy to meet them.\nIt is symbolic of one who knows that death is not going to destroy. It is also symbolic of one who welcomes death, who goes to meet it. It is symbolic that Jesus accepts whatsoever is God's will. He has surrendered. The earth has surrendered to the sky; the body has surrendered to the soul; the son of man has surrendered to the son of God.\nRISE, LET US BE GOING. BEHOLD, HE IS AT HAND THAT DOTH BETRAY\nME.\nCome Follow To You, Vol 4 Chapter #6 Chapter title: Happiness is that which Happens 26 December 1975 am in Buddha Hall The first question:\nQuestion 1\nOSHO: L DON'T WANT TO BE THIS, I DON'T WANT TO BE THAT; I DON'T\nWANT TO BE HERE, I DON'T WANT TO BE THERE; I DON'T WANT TO LIVE, I DON'T WANT TO DIE; I DON'T WANT TO CRY, I DON'T WANT TO\nLAUGH; I CAN'T BE PASSIVE, I CAN'T BE ACTIVE; I CAN'T WILL AND I CAN'T SURRENDER.\nSO then just be in between.\nAnd this is not a question of one person, this is the state of all minds. The mind cannot be this and cannot be that. The mind does not want to be defined, does not want to be static, does not want to be confined; so whenever you want to try to be this, the mind starts working to be that. It goes on moving in the polarities.\nMind is a movement; it is a constant movement.\nSo what can be done? -- don't try to be this or that; just be in between. If you can be in between, you transcend mind. Just watch, be a witness. Don't to to do anything; just observe mind going from A to B, from B to A again; mind moving from one side to the other like a pendulum of an old clock: from left to right, from right to left.\nHave you watched a pendulum? When it is going to the left, it is gathering momentum to go to the right. On the surface it is going to the left; deep inside, it is gathering momentum to go to the opposite pole. When it is going to the right it is being prepared to go to the left.\nWhen you love a person through the mind, you are already getting ready to hate him. There is a poem by D. H. Lawrence in which he says,'The moment I say to my beloved'I love you', I have already started hating her. The moment I say to my beloved'I will be forever and forever with you', I have already departed.' The divorce is on the way. In the very moment you are getting married, divorce is on the way.\nThis is the way of the mind, how the mind functions. Just try to understand the functioning of the mind, otherwise you will always be in chaos, confusion, in a sort of insanity. Become a watcher. Get out of the traffic of the mind, stand by the side of the road and just see. And when I say just see, I mean don't evaluate, don't judge. Don't say,'This is good, that is wrong.' Once you say,'This is good,'\nyou are no more a witness: you have jumped into the river; you are already identified, you are already in trouble. Just stand by the side of the road, or, sit on the bank of a river and let the river flow wherever it goes. You are not concerned; it is none of your business. Unconcerned, indifferent, just watching, you will suddenly be in between: neither this nor that. That in between point is the point of transcendence. Suddenly, the mind disappears with all its traffic. You are left alone, alone in tremendous purity, alone in absolute innocence, alone with no movement -- silent, eternal -- not going anywhere, just being here. You are not trying to become someone, something, this or that -- just being yourself. And to be yourself is to be divine. To be yourself is to meditate. To be yourself is all that religion is about. This is what I'm teaching here.\nI'm not teaching you a particular pattern of life. I'm not giving you a style of life. At the most, I'm trying to give you a vision, a clarity, an understanding. I'm not\ntrying to give you a character: moral or immoral, good or bad. I'm not giving you a philosophy to live by, I'm simply giving you an insight into yourself. Then, no philosophy is needed, no pattern is needed. Then, you can just be yourself with no condemnation, with no evaluation. And that purity of being oneself, that beauty of being oneself transcends all that you can desire, transcends all that you can even conceive of, transcends all that you can eve imagine or dream about.\nJust a glimpse of it, and you will never be the same again.\nSo, this is not a question from somebody in particular. Krishna Radha has asked it, but it is not only her question; it is everybody's question. It is one of the most basic, essential questions of all human beings, of all those who are trapped in the mind. And there is only one way out of the trap: that you don't choose; neither this nor that -- you simply don't choose. You withdraw from choice and you become choiceless. Choicelessness is freedom. To choose is to choose a prison; to choose is to choose a bondage. To choose is wrong, to be choiceless is to be right.\nThe second question:\nQuestion 2\nHOW IS IT POSSIBLE? -- I'M AFRAID WHEN I FEEL YOUR LOVE DEEP INSIDE ME.\nLove always creates fear because love is death, a greater death than the ordinary death you know of.\nIn an ordinary death the body dies, but that is not death at all. Body is just like a dress: when it is tatty and old you change for a new one. It is not death, it is just a change: a change of a dress, or a change of a house or abode. But you continue, the mind continues -- just the same old mind in new bodies, just the same old wine in new bottles. The form changes but not the mind, the shape changes but not the mind. So the ordinary death is not a real death; love is a real death: the body does not die but the mind dies, the body continues to be the same but the ego disappears.\nIf you love, you will have to drop all the conceptions that you have about yourself. If you love, you CANNOT be the ego because the ego will not allow\nlove. They are antagonistic. If you choose the ego you will not be able to choose love. If you choose love you will have to drop the ego. Hence, the fear.\nA greater fear than death grips you whenever you are in love. That's why love has disappeared from the world. Rarely, very rarely does the phenomenon happen that love descends. What you call love is just a false coin: you have invented it because it is so difficult to live without love. It is difficult because without love, life carries no meaning; it is meaningless. Without love, life has no poetry in it. Without love, the tree exists but never flowers. Without love, you cannot dance, you cannot celebrate, you cannot feel grateful, you cannot pray.\nWithout love, temples are just ordinary houses; with love an ordinary house is transformed, transfigured into a temple. Without love you remain just possibilities -- empty gestures. With love, for the first time you become substantial. With love, for the first time, the soul arises in you. The ego drops but the soul arises.\nIt is impossible to live without love, so humanity has created a trick. Humanity has invented a trick, a device. The device is: to live in a false love so that the ego continues on its own. Nothing is changed and you can play the game of being in love: you can go on thinking that you love, you can go on believing that you love. But look at your love -- what happens out of it? -- nothing except misery, nothing except hell, nothing except conflict, quarrel, violence. Look deeply into your love relationships. They are more akin to hate relationships than to love.It is better to call them hate relationships than to call them love relationships. But because everybody is living in the same way, you never become aware.\nEverybody is carrying the false coin; you never become aware. The real coin of love is Very costly: you can purchase it only at the cost of losing yourself. There is no other way.\nSo the question is perfectly relevant. It is from one that I know. I know her love towards me, I know her deep possibilities. She is just on the brink. Any moment the ego can collapse, but she is somehow holding herself together. She will not be able to for long though; she will have to collapse. Hence, the fear.\n'How is it possible?' she asks.'I'm afraid when I feel your love deep inside me.' She thinks it is a sort of contradiction: if she loves so much, then why this fear?\nAnd I tell you, the fear is there because she loves so much. There is no contradiction in it. It is an absolutely consistent thing -- whenever you love you are afraid. Moving towards love is moving towards an abyss. One starts wavering, one feels dizzy. Go to a height in the Himalayas and look down at the valley; that valley is no-thing. When you look down at the valley of love, a TREMENDOUS fear grips you. You are almost paralyzed: you cannot run away, you cannot take the jump. You simply tremble in infinite fear. What to do? Going back is not possible because love attracts: love calls your depth, love calls your future, love calls your potentiality; love gives you a glimpse of what you can be.\nYou cannot run away from it, and you cannot jump because the cost is too high. You will have to drop yourself -- all that you have been thinking yourself to be -- the image, the past, the identity.\nBut I tell you, the cost only seems to be too much BEFORE the jump. Once you take the jump... then you will know that whatsoever you have given up is nothing, and what you have attained is INFINITELY valuable. Let me tell you a paradox: love demands that you drop that which you don't have, and love offers you that which you already have. Love wants you to get rid of that which you don't have.\nThe ego is a false entity, just a notion, a cloud in the sky of your being; just smoke, nothing substantial; a dream. Love requires you to drop that which you don't have, and love is ready to give you that which you have and have always had. Love gives you your self back; the ego goes on hiding you from your self, love reveals you to your self. But the fear is there. The fear is natural, and one has to go in spite of the fear.\nBe courageous, don't be cowards. The real mettle of your being is tested only when love arises. Never before it do you know of what mettle you are made. In ordinary life, in the marketplace, doing this and that, in the world of ambition and power politics, your real mettle is never really tested. You never pass through the fire.\nLove is the fire.\nIf you are really gold you will survive it. If you are not real gold, you will be\ngone. But I tell you that you are real gold.\nTrust me -- pass through the fire. Hesitation is natural, but don't make hesitation a barrier. Even with the hesitation, pass through it. In spite of the fear pass through the fire. And only through the fire will the rose of your consciousness flower. There is no other way.\nThe third question:\nQuestion 3\nIT SEEMS THAT NOTHING EVER REALLY DROPS AWAY. SUDDENLY IT IS\nGONE, BUT JUST AS SUDDENLY IT IS BACK AGAIN. IT ALL SEEMS LIKE A MAGIC TRICK.\n... A very meaningful question, with tremendous implications for understanding. Let us move into it very slowly.\nYes, this is so: nothing ever really drops away. Nothing ever really drops away; suddenly it is gone, and as suddenly as it left, in the same way, at any moment, suddenly it is back again. Why is it so? -- because you have never tried to understand the nature of human consciousness. The nature of human consciousness is absolute freedom. When I say absolute freedom, I mean you are free at any moment to be whatsoever you decide. Nothing holds itself against you. You may have been a saint up to now. You may have lived in celibacy up to now. This very moment you can change: you can throw away your celibacy i you can fall in love with a woman or a man. Because you have been celibate in the past does not, CANNOT become a bondage. You remain free. If you want to be celibate in this moment also, you can be. But remember that it is not because of the past, it is again a fresh decision. You have to go on making your decision again and again and again, reviving it again and again and again. At any moment you can drop it.\nExistentialists are true. They say: existence precedes essence. It is a very pregnant sentence. Let me repeat it: existence precedes essence.\nA man is born; he is pure freedom. He has no essence, only existence. Then he\nwill choose his essence, whom he is going to be -- and it will be his choice. He can be a saint, he can be a sinner; he can be a criminal, he can be a murderer, or he can ke a martyr. He brings pure existence into the world -- a blank sheet, a pure canvas. What colors he is going to use, and what sort of painting he is going to make of his life, is totally up to him. He does not bring a character. He simply brings a potentiality, pure potentiality. And this pure potentiality always remains pure; you cannot corrupt it. You become a saint: that means you decide that to be a saint is going to be your essence. But this is your decision, and if you want to keep it up to the very end of your life, every morning, in fact, every minute of your existence, you will have to decide again and again and vote for it.\nAny moment you stop deciding, any moment you say,'Enough is enough, now I want to change,' nobody is barring the path. You can cancel your whole past in a single moment, because that past was your decision, nobody else's. It is not like a destiny forced from above, from outside. It is your own inner decision. You can change it.\nThat's why nothing ever disappears. You can become a sinner, but tomorrow you may again change. You can again take the vow of a Catholic priest and become a priest again, become celibate. Try to understand this.. This has tremendous implications for your life.\nDon't throw the responsibility on anybody else. Nobody else is a deciding factor, neither your mother nor your father. Whatsoever the psychoanalysts say is really irrelevant to your being. It is for you to decide. Even the people who are mad are mad because of their own decision. Somehow they found it to be convenient.\nSomehow they decided; they voted for it. Nobody has forced them. Nobody can force anybody because the innermost quality of being is freedom. It is not something accidental; it is your very nature.\nYou have been smoking up to now. For thirty years you may have been a chain smoker and you come to me and you ask,'What to do? How to stop?' You are asking a wrong question. In fact, you don't want to stop. Go deep into your own mind: you don't want to stop; you are playing a game. You don't want to stop but you want to;show people that you want to stop. Or, this very idea that you want to stop gives you a very, very good image about yourself. Then you go on saying,'What can I do? It has become such a long habit; I cannot stop, though I want to stop.' This is simple, sheer foolishness and stupidity. You are not\ndeceiving anybody except yourself. If you really want to Stop, there is no need to do anything about it. The very decision that you want to stop is enough: the half-smoked cigarette in your hand will drop of its own accord. But you remain free.\nThat does not mean that again tomorrow you cannot take it up. You remain free; nobody can bind you. Again tomorrow you can take it up. Then please, don't start saying that it is because of old habit:'I tried my best, and I had stopped, and for twenty-four hours I didn't smoke. But because of a thirty-year-old habit, I am again taking it up. The urge is too much.'\nDo not try to befool anybody. There is nothing like that; you are again deciding.\nIf you are deciding, then it is okay. You can find a thousand and one ways to decide again. But remember always, it is your decision, yours and nobody else's; and you remain free. That's why it happens that nothing seems to disappear forever. It comes again and again -- because you again invoke it to come, you again call it to come. I have heard: Mulla Nasrudin had once decided that he would never touch any alcoholic thing again in his life any intoxicant. And he was a drunkard. So just to test his own will-power, he walked on the path where the pub was. Just in front of the pub, he looked at the pub in avery proud way and said to himself,'I have decided that nothing can attract me and nothing can force me to g astray'; and he heartily walked a hundred feet away. Then he patted his own back and he said,'Nasrudin, you are great. Now I will treat you, come to the pub.' And on that day he drank twice.\nDon't play games with yourself. It is your freedom, but freedom is very dangerous because it does not leave any corner for you to hide in. You cannot throw responsibility on anybody else. Simply and absolutely, you are responsible. Just watch and see the fact of it, and truth liberates.\nIf you can see this, then whether you decide to smoke or drink does not matter.\nWhether you decide to drop it does not matter. The only thing that matters is to be always mindful of your freedom. If you are not aware of that then this will happen: you will feel that nothing ever really drops away. It comes again and again, and of course it comes worse than ever. It comes with a vengeance.\nBut don't think of yourself as a victim; you are not. Try what I am saying, just watch what I am saying. Smoking... let there be a decision that you are not going\nto smoke. Let the cigarette drop from your fingers, and then watch. Just go on observing. Whenever you again want to smoke, don't say that it is because of old habit.,It is again a fresh decision, not an old habit. You go on throwing the responsibility on the old habit to save your own face. Please don't do that. Say that,'Now I have decided to smoke again.' Nobody is barring you; it is your decision. You can cancel, or you can vote for it again. But always insist that it is a fresh decision, and you will never be in the grip of so-called habits, so-called mechanical habits. You will feel a free man. Smoking or not smoking is immaterial; to feel a free man is very significant. Nothing is more significant than that. And I am here to make you aware of your freedom. If you go to the so- called saints, they will make you aware of your mechanicalness: that is the difference. They will make you aware of your mechanicalness, and they will create a new mechanicalness in you. They will say,'You have been smoking for thirty years? Now take a vow that you will never smoke again.' Old habit is there; now they are telling you to create a greater habit in order to destroy the old habit. Then non-smoking will become a habit, but the freedom is nowhere there. Whether you smoke or don't smoke, you remain a victim.\nWe have a sannyasin here, Narendra Bodhisattva. His father is a very beautiful man. People think that he is a little crazy, but he is really a beautiful man. He belongs to a certain sect of Jainism. He went on a visit, on a pilgrimage, and when you go to Jain monks they always ask you to take a vow because otherwise your going on the pilgrimage is meaningless. The monk there asked him to take some vow, so he decided to take a vow. He said,'I have never smoked in my life -\n- now I will smoke.' The monk must have thought him crazy. He came back and he told me,'This vow I have taken.' And now he RELIGIOUS smokes. I said,'You are a beautiful man. You did well.' Whether you smoke or don't smoke, all vows lead you to mechanicalness.\nMy whole emphasis is that you should become aware of your freedom. Let your life flow out of your freedom. Whatsoever you decide is up to you. Who am I to tell you to smoke or not to smoke, to drink or not to drink? I am not worried about such foolishnesses; this is for you to decide. You are your own master.\nThese are trivia; they are not significant. All that matters is that you remain alert, remain centered in your freedom. Never do anything which goes against your freedom. Do -- everything is allowed if it is done out of freedom. To act out of freedom is to be virtuous, to act out of bondage is to sin.\nThe fourth question:\nQuestion 4\nYOU SAY THAT IF A MAN IS THIRSTY HE SHOULD COME AND DRINK FROM YOU. WE ARE HERE AS MUCH AS WE CAN BE, AND YOU ARE HERE, ARE YOU NOT? SO WHAT IS MISSING?\nNothing is missing! On the contrary, something is there which is not needed. Nothing is missing. There is something which is not needed: you are too much.\nYour too-muchness is creating the barrier. If you can somehow miss, the thing will happen immediately. When you come to me the next time, leave yourself back at home. Come alone; don't bring yourself here. But you go on bringing yourself. If it is too difficult to leave yourself at home, then leave yourself where you leave your shoes.\nNothing is missing. The whole problem of man is not that something is lacking in him, but that something more it is a problem of plusses. I am here, available, but you are is there which is not needed. It is not a problem of minusses, not there to receive me. It is not because you are empty, but because you are too full, too full of yourself. There is no space for me to enter into you: so many thoughts, so many ideas, so many ideologies. Somebody is a Christian, somebody is a Hindu, somebody is a Mohammedan, somebody is a Jain -- so many diseases; this is the plus. And among these diseases is sitting the king of all diseases -- the ego; enthroned, crowned. This plus has to be dissolved.\nHere you have to be wakened, empty, void, open, so that the breeze that is blowing here can pass through you without any obstruction. And with the breeze, the dust that you have gathered through many lives will be blown out.\nYou will be left clean and pure.\nSo remember this: whenever you ask such questions, you think that you have to do something which you are not doing, that something is missing. No, you are doing something which is not needed to be done. While listening to me you are thinking -- that is the plus. While listening 'to me just be a listening. There is no\nneed to think, because I am not propounding a philosophy here. I am simply stating a few facts. Those facts are not hypothetical; those facts are my realizations. I have come to see something which I would like to deliver to you.\nBut if you are listening without thinking, only then is it possible. When I say don't think, I don't mean that whatsoever I say you have to accept blindly. No, I'm simply saying: just listen; no need to believe in it, no need to disbelieve in it.\nDon't bring that problem in right now. Just listen so that you can understand what I am saying. Later on you can think about it, and you can decide whether to be with me or not to be with me. That decision is possible only if you have listened rightly.\nAnd how will you decide if you have not been listening to me? This is the beauty of it, that if you have listened rightly, a fact has a certain quality in it: so that once it enters into you, you cannot deny it, you cannot be against it. A fact has a self-evidence about it. It does not need any proof or argument. It has a truth in it.\nOnce you listen you can feed that truth within you. Just listen to me, and then there will be no need to think about it. You will be able to see the truth of it, and truth liberates.\nI cannot liberate you, nobody can liberate you; only truth can liberate you. And the truth has to be seen by YOU. I may be seeing it, I may be telling it to you. In a thousand and one ways I may be showering it upon you, but that is useless if you are not open, if your pot is upside down, if you are not listening When I am speaking, if simultaneously you go on thinking of what I am saying, if you go on like commentators in a cricket match and you go on commenting -- 'Yes, this is right, that is wrong; that I cannot believe; this goes against my philosophy; I am a Christian, what this man is saying is anti-Christian; this is not written in the Bible' -- if you go on commenting, while you are commenting you are missing me. Then you may listen to bits and fragments, and out of those bits and fragments you may create something within you which has nothing to do with me.\nListen to me as totally as possible. Listening to me, be completely vacant, empty, so that there is no resistance. I can pass through and through you; you become transparent to me. Once the truth-seed falls into you, there is no need to be worried; it sprouts on its own. It brings much fruit on its own. It does not need\nyour help. It simply needs one thing: please don't hinder it. You are not asked to help it to grow, you are only asked to allow it to fall in the right soil of your heart.\nThe fifth question:\nQuestion 5\nSHOULD ONE FIRST COME TO TERMS WITH ONE'S OWN LONELINESS BEFORE ENTERING INTO RELATIONSHIP?\nYes, you have to come to terms with your loneliness, so much so that the loneliness is transformed into aloneness. Only then will you be capable of moving into a deep enriching relationship. Only then will you be able to move into love. What do I mean when I say that one has to come to terms with one's loneliness, so much so that it becomes aloneness?\nLoneliness is a negative state of mind. Aloneness is positive, notwithstanding what the dictionaries say. In dictionaries, loneliness and aloneness are synonymous -- they are synonyms; in life they are not. Loneliness is a state of mind when you are constantly missing the other, aloneness is the state of mind when you are constantly delighted in yourself. Loneliness is miserable, aloneness is blissful. Loneliness is always worried, missing something, hankering for something, desiring for something; aloneness is a deep fulfillment, not going out, tremendously content, happy, celebrating. In loneliness you are off center, in aloneness you are centered and rooted. Aloneness is beautiful. It has an elegance around it, a grace, a climate of tremendous satisfaction. Loneliness is; beggarly; all around it there is begging and nothing else. It has no grace around it. In fact it is ugly. Loneliness is a dependence, aloneness is SHEER independence. One feels as if one is one's whole world, one's whole existence.\nNow, if you move into a relationship when you are feeling lonely, then you will exploit the other. The other will become a means to satisfy you. You will use the other, and everybody resents being used because no man is here to become a means for anybody else. Every man is an end unto himself. Nobody is here to be used like a thing, everybody is here to be worshipped like a king. Nobody is here to fulfill anybody else's expectations, everybody is here just to be himself. So whenever you move in any relationship out of loneliness, the relationship is already on the rocks. Even before it has started, it is already on the rocks. Even\nbefore the birth, the child is dead. It is going to create more misery for you. And remember, when you move from your loneliness you will fall in relationship with somebody who is in the same plight, because no man who is really living his aloneness will be attracted towards you. You will be too below him. He can, at the most, sympathize, but cannot love you. One who is on his peak of aloneness can only be attracted towards somebody who is also alone. So whenever you move out of loneliness, you will find a man of the same type; you will find your own reflection somewhere. Two beggars will meet, two miserable people will meet. And remember, when two miserable people meet, it is not an ordinary addition, it is a multiplication. They create much more misery for each other than they could have created in their loneliness.\nFirst become alone. First start enjoying yourself. First love yourself. First become so authentically happy that if nobody comes it doesn't matter; you are full, overflowing. If nobody knocks at your door it is perfectly okay -- YOU are not missing. You are not waiting for somebody to come and knock at the door. You are at home. If somebody comes, good, beautiful. If nobody comes, that too is beautiful and good.\nTHEN move into relationship. Now you move like a master, not like a beggar.\nNow you move like an emperor,. not like a beggar. And the person who has lived in his aloneness will always be attracted to another person who is also living his aloneness beautifully, because the same attracts the same. When two masters meet -- masters of their being, of their aloneness -- happiness is not just added, it is multiplied. It becomes a tremendous phenomenon of celebration.\nAnd they don't exploit, they share. They don't use each other. Rather, on the contrary, they both become one and enjoy the existence that surrounds them.\nTwo lonely people are always facing each other, confronting. Two people who have known aloneness are together, facing something higher than both. I always give this example: two ordinary lovers who are both lonely always face each other; two real lovers, on a full moon night, will not be facing each other. They may be holding hands, but they will be facing the full moon high in the sky. They will not be facing each other, they will be together facing something else.\nSometimes they will be listening to a symphony of Mozart or Beethoven or Wagner together. Sometimes they will be sitting by the side of a tree and\nenjoying the tremendous being of the tree enveloping them. Sometimes they may be sitting by a waterfall and listening to the wild music that is continuously being created there. Sometimes, by the ocean, they will both be looking to the farthest possibility that the eyes can see. Whenever two lonely persons meet, they look at each other, because they are constantly in search of ways and means to exploit the other: how to use the other, how to be happy through the other. But two persons who are deeply contented within themselves are not trying to use each other. Rather, they become fellow travellers; they move on a pilgrimage.\nThe goal is high, the goal is far away. Their common interest joins them together.\nOrdinarily the common interest is sex. Sex can join two persons momentarily and casually, and very superficially. Real lovers have a greater common interest. It is not that sex will not be there; it may be there, but as part of a higher harmony.\nListening to Mozart's or Beethoven's symphony, they may come so close, so close, so close, that there may be love. They may make love to each other, but it is in the greater harmony of a Beethoven symphony. The symphony was the real thing; the love happens as part of it. And when love happens of its own accord, unsought, unthought, simply happens as part of a higher harmony, it has a totally different quality to it. it is divine, it is no longer human.\nThe word 'happiness' comes from a Scandanavian word 'hap'. The word'happening' also comes from the same Scandanavian root. Happiness is that which happens. You cannot produce it, you cannot command it, you cannot force it. At the most, you can be available to it. Whenever it happens, it happens.\nTwo real lovers are always available, but never thinking, never trying to find happiness. Then they are never frustrated, because whenever it happens it happens. They create the situation. In fact, if you are happy with yourself, you are already the situation, and if the other is also happy with himself or herself, she is also the situation. When these two situations come close, a greater situation is created. In that greater situation much happens -- nothing is produced.\nMan has not to do anything to be happy. Man has just to flow and let go.\nSo, the question is: should one first come to terms with his own loneliness before entering into relationship? Yes; yes, absolutely. It has to be so, otherwise you\nwill be frustrated, and in the name of love you will be doing something else which is not love at all.\nThe last question:\nQuestion 6\nOSHO, I FEEL YOUR GRACE MELTING ME. LOVE TO YOU MY MASTER.\nIt is from Anup.\nIt is not a question. A real question is never a question, it is a statement. This is a statement of Anup's state of being at this moment. I can also feel that he is melting, but this is just the beginning.\nDon't become too self-conscious about it, or else the melting will stop Allow it so that more and more becomes possible. Go on melting, and always remember that more is waiting. Always remember that it is always the beginning, never the end.\nIn fact, there is no end to it.\nLife is such a mystery: there are only beginnings, no ends.\nSo, go on melting, always remembering that more is coming. Never become satisfied. A complacent satisfaction can become suicidal. There come many moments when one feels that more is not possible. One comes to a peak and one feels,'Now, how is more possible?' Whenever this idea that more is not possible arises in your mind, remember me. More is always possible. There never comes a moment when more is not possible. That is the meaning when we say that God is infinite: you enter into God but you never reach. Let me repeat it again: you enter into God but you never reach Him. You can drown in Him but you cannot say that you have known Him. It is so vast, so infinitely vast, and man is just a tiny drop.\nGo on melting, always remembering that more is on the way.\nCome Follow To You, Vol 4 Chapter #7 Chapter title: The Ego is the Judas 27 December 1975 am in Buddha Hall Matthew 26\n47 AND WHILE HE YET SPAKE, LO, JUDAS, ONE OF THE TWELVE, CAME, AND WITH HIM A GREAT MULTITUDE WITH SWORDS AND STAVES, FROM THE CHIEF PRIESTS AND ELDERS OF THE PEOPLE.\n48 NOW HE THAT BETRAYED HIM GAVE THEM A SIGN, SAYING: WHOMSOEVER I SHALL KISS, THAT SAME IS HE; HOLD HIM FAST.\n49 AND FORTHWITH HE CAME TO JESUS, AND SAID: HAIL, MASTER; AND\nKISSED HIM.\n55 IN THAT SAME HOUR SAID JESUS TO THE MULTITUDES: ARE YE COME\nOUT AS AGAINST A THIEF WITH SWORDS AND STAVES FOR TO TAKE\nME? I SAT DAILY WITH YOU TEACHING IN THE TEMPLE, AND YE LAID\nNO HOLD ON ME.\n56 BUT ALL THIS WAS DONE, THAT THE SCRIPTURES OF THE PROPHETS\nMIGHT BE FULFILLED. THEN ALL THE DISCIPLES FORSOOK HIM, AND\nFLED.\nMatthew 27\n1 WHEN THE MORNING WAS COME, ALL THE CHIEF PRIESTS AND\nELDERS OF THE PEOPLE TOOK COUNSEL AGAINST JESUS TO PUT HIM TO\nDEATH:\n2 AND WHEN THEY HAD BOUND HIM, THEY LED HIM AWAY, AND DELIVERED HIM TO PONTIUS PILATE, THE GOVERNOR.\n11 AND JESUS STOOD BEFORE THE GOVERNOR, AND THE GOVERNOR\nASKED HIM, SAYING: ART THOU THE KING OF THE JEWS? AND JESUS\nSAID UNTO HIM: THOU SAYEST.\n12 AND WHEN HE WAS ACCUSED OF THE CHIEF PRIESTS AND ELDERS, HE ANSWERED NOTHING.\nTHEN SAID PILATE UNTO HIM: HEAREST THOU NOT HOW MANY THINGS THEY WITNESS AGAINST THEE?\n14 AND HE ANSWERED TO HIM NEVER A WORD; INSOMUCH THAT THE\nGOVERNOR MARVELLED GREATLY.\nA MAN was travelling through the wilderness when he came across some animals having a speech contest. The judge was a lion who invited the man to become part of the audience. The man accepted.\nA fox stood up and gave a smooth and clever speech. At one point, he declared,'The moon is larger than the sun.'\nThe next speaker was an elephant whose voice boomed out with power and authority. His talk included the sentence,'Summer is cooler than winter.'\nThen came a tiger whose eloquence impressed everyone. At one point he said,'The river runs uphill.'\nThe observing man remarked to the lion,'They are superb orators. However, I'm puzzled. All of them made statements which were obviously untrue. Not only that, but the audience either did not notice or did not care. Why do your speakers make false statements?\n'That's an unworthy habit, alright,' admitted the lion,'but the audience is more interested in entertainment than in enlightenment. And, if you don't mind sir, I would like to tell you that we have picked up this bad habit from you human beings.'\nThe priests, the politicians: they are great orators, superb; great thinkers, very complex weavers, spinners of theories, philosophies, but, they are not sincere about religion. They use religion. Religion is, at the most, a profession. And the audience is not interested in enlightenment, the audience is seeking entertainment. Whether you go to a cinema hall or to a theatre, to a dancing party, or to the church or the temple, your interest is the same: you are seeking some place where you can forget yourself. You are seeking entertainment.\nEnlightenment is just the opposite. You will have to seek a space within yourself where it becomes impossible to forget yourself; where even if you want, it is not possible to forget; where self-remembering becomes a constant flame.\nHere is the point where people like Jesus create trouble. They are not great orators. They are not interested in theories and they are not there to entertain anybody. They are not professionals. They are not using religion for their own ends. They are sincere people -- sincerely interested in helping, sincerely interested in creating a situation where man can realize himself. The trouble starts because the professionals are already there; the priests, the politicians are already there.\nWhenever a man like Jesus enters into the world, the priests and the politicians become alert. It is dangerous for them. If Jesus succeeds, they will be thrown, uprooted. The whole establishment will collapse. If the establishment has to remain, then Jesus has to be destroyed.\nThis is the first thing to be understood because this is always happening, even today, and this will go on happening History goes on repeating itself not because there is any natural law that history should repeat itself, but only because man has not changed. Man remains the same, the old. He behaves again and again in\nthe same way. You are here with me; many priests are worried about it, many politicians are worried about it. Why should they be worried? It is none of their business -- but it is. Their very base is that religion should not become a sincere search. It should remain, at the most, a superficial entertainment; at the most, a mannerism, an etiquette. And they are afraid, because if somebody like Jesus asserts himself, the very presence of Jesus creates a deep inferiority in them. Not that Jesus is trying to make them inferior; Jesus is not even aware of it. He has not even thought about it. But through his very presence... the sun rises in the morning, and the stars, disappear. Whenever Jesus is there, the priests start disappearing. The politicians are in a difficulty; they cannot hold their ground.\nI have heard a very beautiful anecdote about a certain doctor, Buzby. He was a great headmaster in England, a very famous headmaster. Even the king became interested. And once, the king went to see the headmaster in his school. The king was allowed in the school. Doctor Buzby started through the schoolrooms with his hat on his head, while His Majesty walked complacently behind him with his hat under his arm. The other people who had followed the king were a little disturbed and worried and restless:'Is this headmaster a little eccentric? He has not shown even that much respect to the king; he could have taken his hat off.'\nEven the king was a little uneasy about it, but he didn't say anything.\nWhen he was taking his leave at the door, the doctor, with great humility, then addressed the king,'I hope Your Majesty will excuse my want of respect hitherto, but if my boys were to imagine that there were a greater man in the kingdom than myself, I should never be able to rule them. So please excuse me.' He said,'They should know that even the king is not greater than their headmaster.\nOtherwise, it would be impossible to rule them again.'\nThis is what happens when a Jesus walks on the earth: the politicians, the priests, become afraid. They cannot allow the common man to know that a greater possibility exists, that a greater man is possible. Otherwise, they will not be able to rule again. Hence, Jesus has to be crucified. He has to be destroyed before the public so the public can know well 'who is the boss here'.\nListen to the sutras.\nAND WHILE HE YET SPAKE, LO, JUDAS, ONE OF THE TWELVE, CAME, AND WITH HIM A GREAT MULTITUDE WITH SWORDS AND STAVES,\nFROM THE CHIEF PRIESTS AND ELDERS OF THE PEOPLE.\nJudas was Jesus' own disciple. He betrayed him. Only love can betray, because to betray somebody, you have to come close to him. To hate somebody, first you have to love him. Remember this complexity of love: whenever you love somebody, a part of you goes on hating because love requires surrender, and the ego resists. Love requires that you should be lost, that you should become one with your lover, your Master, your beloved, your friend, your God. Love requires that you should disappear, and the ego resists, the ego starts struggling against it. Judas is nothing but a representation of the ego. And remember that Judas exists in each of you; in everybody, the ego is the Judas.\nLet me repeat it again. Those twelve disciples of Jesus were very simple people, except for Judas. They were uneducated people, common people, people of the earth. You would not have recognized them anywhere in a crowd. They would have been lost. Only Judas was not ordinary. He was polished, educated, cultured, sophisticated: that's what the ego is. Ego is nothing but a sophistication.\nEgo is nothing but the part which has become extraordinary in you. When you love, you become ordinary.\nRemember, people who are very egoistic are always against love. In India you will find them in the monasteries, in the Himalayas. People who are very egoistic are against love. They may say that they are leaving the world, the world of love, to seek and search for God. They are deceiving nobody except themselves; because unless you love tremendously, you cannot seek God. In the Himalayan peaks, they are seeking nothing but their own egos. God is to be sought in love because God is to be sought in your own crucifixion; when the ego disappears, He is.\nHave you watched in your own mind that whenever you are moving in a love relationship, there arises a certain uneasiness? You are allured, fascinated. You would like to delve deeply into it, but a part of you starts becoming uneasy. Look at that part; that is Judas. That part says,'What are you going to do? -- surrender?\nWhat are you going to do? -- become ordinary?'\nNothing is more ordinary than love. Love is very earthly. Nothing is more natural than love. Nobody needs to learn it; everybody is born knowing it. Love is all over. The whole existence throbs in love. Love is the very beat of life. Love\nis very natural, very ordinary.\nThe ego is *unnatura1, extraordinary: you want to feel superior to others, you want to be crowned. You don't want to belong to the earth because all belong to the earth. You want something to be special, to be somebody special -- it is the Judas.\nTo betray, one needs to be in love.\nJudas loved Jesus, but could not love totally. That is the problem: if you love and you don't love totally, you can betray at any moment, because the part that is not yet in love will go on finding ways and means to rebel, to go against. Then Jesus was crucified because of this betrayal. The next day, Judas committed suicide.\nThat too is a very deep, a deeply meaningful parable. Why did he commit suicide himself the next day? Because then there was no point -- the whole ego had been existing against Jesus. He loved Jesus, but only a part, and a part was fighting.\nNow with Jesus crucified, that part which was fighting disappeared. There was no point now, and he could not have found a man like Jesus again to hate, to fight, to struggle against, to love. Once Jesus was gone, Judas was meaningless.\nOnce Jesus was gone, the whole existence of Judas became empty. He committed suicide. In his life there was meaning because of Jesus; he loved and hated the man. On one side he loved, on another side he hated.\nA Judas means: one who is divided within himself. A Judas means: one who is schizophrenic, split. Judas is not just the name of a certain person who betrayed Jesus; Judas is a disease. Judas is a psychological split.\nSo while listening to these sutras, always remember that you can be a Judas, and you can be a Jesus also. If the split disappears, you are a Jesus. If the split goes on existing, you remain a Judas. Between Judas and Jesus there is just a little distance, and the distance is that of division. Are you divided in your love? --\nthen you are a Judas. Are you undivided in your love? -- then you are a Jesus.\nAND WHILE HE YET SPAKE, LO, JUDAS, ONE OF THE TWELVE, CAME, AND WITH HIM A GREAT MULTITUDE WITH SWORDS AND STAVES,\nFROM THE CHIEF PRIESTS AND ELDERS OF THE PEOPLE.\nNOW HE THAT BETRAYED HIM GAVE THEM A SIGN, SAVING: WHOMSOEVER I SHALL KISS, THAT SAME IS HE; HOLD HIM FAST.\nVery symbolic -- betraying Jesus by kissing him -- the kiss of death. The same kiss that could have been of love, was of betrayal. The SAME kiss that could have been of love, was of betrayal. The same kiss that could been of life became part of death. The same kiss which could have been elixir, ambrosia, became poison. The kiss is the same, but the quality that you bring to it makes it either the ambrosia of eternal life or makes it poison.\nRemember: gestures are always the same; only you change behind them. Only you change; gestures are the same. You love, you hate, you surrender, you resist; gestures are the same. But the quality behind them changes, because gestures are only containers; whatsoever you put inside them is the real thing.\nJudas had chosen a kiss as an indication.\nHe said to the multitude, to the enemies,'Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he; hold him fast.' He could have chosen some other gesture also. Anything would have been indicative, so why a kiss?\nA part of him loved Jesus; a part of him loved him tremendously. Never be very hard on Judas. Christians have been very hard. Have compassion. Never be very hard on Judas, because he is hidden within you also. Don't just hate him because he betrayed, because you also have the same tendency to betray. Every human being is prone to become a Judas. I say to you, have compassion on him. Try to understand him. Why had he chosen the kiss? He could have chosen any indication.\nA part of him really loved Jesus, but a part hated him. It was a love-hate relationship. It was both, a dichotomy. Remember, if your love is nothing but an opposition to hate, if your love is nothing but an opposite to hate, the hate will exist within you. There is another dimension of love where love is only the absence of hate, not opposite to it. I teach you THAT love: love as an absence of hate. The real problem is not how to love; the real problem is how to understand hate and drop it through that understanding. Don't hide your hate, don't suppress it; bring it out, get rid of it. Before you can be able to really love and love totally, hate has to be dropped. You can do a simple thing: you can hide the hate and you\ncan go on loving. But the hate which is hiding behind you is going to betray, some day or other. You are a Judas, and you are going to be a Judas.\nUntil Judas betrayed Jesus, he himself was not aware of what he was doing. He became aware only when Jesus was crucified, when he himself saw what he had done. Then he became aware. Then he repented, and committed suicide.\n... I SHALL KISS, THE SAME IS HE; HOLD HIM FAST. AND FORTHWITH HE\nCAME TO JESUS, AND SAID: HAIL, MASTER; AND KISSED HIM.\nIN THAT SAME HOUR SAID JESUS TO THE MULTITUDES: ARE YE COME\nOUT AS AGAINST A THIEF WITH SWORDS AND STAVES FOR TO TAKE\nME? I SAT DAILY WITH YOU TEACHING IN THE TEMPLE, AND YE LAID\nNO HOLD ON ME.\nJesus was moving with the multitudes, in the marketplace, in the temple; he was teaching. He said to these people,'Why have you come with swords and staves, as if you have come against a thief? And I have always been a part of you, I have always lived amongst you, I have been teaching in the temple, so why do you come in the middle of the night with swords, with such a big crowd to catch me, to hold me? Why? You could have caught me any day. And there is no need for swords. You know well that I have got no swords to fight with.' What was Jesus saying to them? He had not said a single word to Judas. That's very, very meaningful.\nThere was nothing to say to Judas. All that could have been said, had been said.\nOn Judas he had been working for years, but it seemed that the disease was incurable. It seemed that the more he had tried to change him, the more he had become resistant and stubborn, It seemed the more attention had been given to him, the more he had become egoistic. He didn't say a single word to Judas, but he talked to the multitudes, to the crowd.\nWhy had this crowd come with swords? They were afraid, afraid of what they were going to commit. Remember this, because to come to Jesus with swords is simply meaningless, absurd. He is a simple man who has always been moving everywhere, who could have been caught any day, by anybody; a fragile body.\nThere was no problem, ever. Why with swords? Try to understand.\nWhenever you carry a sword, it is not against anybody else; it is only because you are afraid. It is because of your fear. They were afraid. For what they were going to commit, they were already guilty about it. These swords were not against Jesus because they were not needed against him. Those swords were against their own guilt, their own fear, their own cowardice. They knew well that to face Jesus was going to be difficult. Just to look into his eyes would be very difficult. And to catch hold of him, to make him a prisoner was going to be almost impossible.\nThey came with swords to have courage, to not be afraid. They came with swords so there would be no need to look into this man's eyes. Bare-handed, he could have been caught anywhere. He was absolutely unprotected, insecure.\nAnd these people knew him well. There was no need, in fact, for Judas even to indicate who he was. Everybody knew about him.\nBut the priests were also afraid, the politicians were also afraid. They also wanted to throw the responsibility on somebody else who could be, could become, the scapegoat for centuries to come. They found Judas. Then Judas became the symbol of betrayal. It is as if Judas became the real culprit.\nIN THAT SAME HOUR SAID JESUS TO THE MULTITUDES: ARE YE COME\nOUT AS AGAINST A THIEF WITH SWORDS AND STAVES FOR TO TAKE\nME? I SAT DAILY WITH YOU TEACHING IN THE TEMPLE, AND YE LAID\nNO HOLD ON ME.\nBUT ALL THIS WAS DONE, THAT THE SCRIPTURES OF THE PROPHETS\nMIGHT BE FULFILLED.\nThis point is significant. In the life of Jesus, or in the life of Krishna, or in the life of Buddha, this point is very significant. They always speak as if they are playing a part in a drama, as if they are simply acting, as if this earth is a great stage and they are fulfilling simple prophecies.\nIt is said that before Rama was born, a great poet, Valmiki, wrote Rama's whole life; before he was born! And then Rama was born; he had to follow Valmiki, because when such a great poet writes something, it has to be followed. What else can you do?\nIt may not have been so, but the story is beautiful. It says that life is a drama: as if it has been written already and it is only unfolding.\nJesus said to those people,'But all this was done that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.' It was said in the old scriptures that this was the way the Messiah was to be caught, crucified. This was the way that the Messiah was to be betrayed by his own disciple, Judas.\nWhat is Jesus saying? He's saying to Judas, in an indirect way,'Don't feel guilty about it. It is just a fulfillment of a prophecy. You are not responsible.' This is his love. He is taking the responsibility from Judas. He is saying,'Don't be afraid, don't feel guilty, don't feel responsible. You are not doing anything. You are just an instrument in the hands of history. It has been prophesied long before that one of my disciples would betray me. You are just instrumental.'\nThis is what Krishna said to Arjuna in the Gita:'Don't be worried. You simply fight the war. You are just instrumental; NIMITTA MATRA -- you are not the doer. The doer is always God. You are just a vehicle that He is using. You just surrender yourself into the hands of the whole, and let things happen.\nWhatsoever is going to happen is going to happen. You relax. Please don't be tense about it.'\nThe same is Jesus' meaning when he says,'But all this was done that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.' He is saying to Judas,'Don't be worried.' He is saying to the multitudes,'Don't feel afraid. Nobody is doing anything wrong. Everything is okay, because this is how it had to happen. This is a beautiful gesture on Jesus' part.\nJust a few days ago I was reading the story of a Hassid mystic, Baal Shem. One day he was sitting just in front of his house. It must have been a winter morning like this, cold, and he was sunning himself. A beggar came. He told the beggar to wait and he would go in the house to search for something for him. But he could not find anything; there was nothing. The wife had gone to some neighbor, and he could only find his wife's ring, the wedding ring that he had given her. He came with the ring and gave it to the beggar.\nWhen the wife returned and found her ring missing, she asked. Baal Shem told the whole story:'I searched, but nothing could be found.'\nThe wife created much trouble for him. She said,'You run after him! Catch hold of the beggar. That ring is my wedding ring and it is very costly, almost a hundred gold coins!'\nBaal Shem ran to catch hold of the beggar, and many people followed him --\n'What is going to happen?' They could not believe that Baal Shem could do that, but he ran. In the marketplace, he found the beggar. He caught hold of him and said,'Wait! Listen to me! That ring is very costly. It can fetch almost one hundred gold coins. Don't allow anybody to cheat you.' That's all that he did, and he went back.\nYou cannot understand the gesture of love. Everybody in the neighborhood thought that he was going to take hold of that beggar and take the ring back. The wife was very happy when he ran; she also thought so. Because we live in such a loveless heart, we cannot understand the gesture of love.\nIt is a gesture of love when Jesus says,'But all this was done that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.'\nRemember well, he does not mean what he says. Christians have been befooled by the words. They think that exactly what he is saying, he also means. No.\nExistence is freedom. It is not determined beforehand. It is not predestined. If it were predestined then all meaning would be lost. Life is not a drama, but you can take it as a drama. If you take it as a drama, you transcend life. But remember, life is not a drama; life is total freedom. Nobody can predict what is going to happen the next moment, because the next moment comes as if out of the blue, totally free and fresh. If it could be predicted, then all meaning would\nbe lost.\nJesus is not saying that he believes in fate. Jesus is not saying that he believes that life is absolutely determined, every bit of it, no. Then why does he say this:'But all this was done that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled'? This is a gesture of love. He is trying to create a situation in which Judas should not feel guilty. He is creating a situation in which the multitudes which have come to take over, to make him prisoner, should not feel guilty. He is saying that it has to be so, so it is happening; nobody is at fault. He is making everybody free of fault.\nThis is a love gesture; tremendously loving and caring about people.\nHis last words on the cross were again the same:'Father, forgive them, because they don't know what they are doing.\nBUT ALL THIS WAS DONE, THAT THE SCRIPTURES OF THE PROPHETS MIGHT BE FULFILLED.\nTHEN THE DISCIPLES FORSOOK HIM, AND FLED -- one betrayed, the\nremaining fled. To be a disciple is really a very arduous thing.\nWhen everything was going well, disciples were there. But now everything was going wrong. Jesus is being caught; disciples start disappearing. They fled. This is the moment, the moment which will decide who is a disciple. Judas betrayed, but the others who fled also betrayed in a way. Their betrayal was negative and Judas' betrayal was positive, but both were betrayals. It is really difficult to become a disciple, because when things are going good everything can be with the Master, but when things start going bad, and every hill has a valley, and every day has a night... even Jesus has a dark night following him. In the day you can be with Jesus, but in the night, when darkness surrounds and everywhere is fear; when death is lurking all around, then to be with Jesus -- there is the test, there is the criterion -- of whether you are really a disciple or not.\nI have heard a beautiful story. It is not exactly a story, but a real thing: it happened.\nShortly after the Second World War, a devastated city in England began its heart-\nbreaking and wearing work of restoration. In the old city square had stood a large statue of Jesus Christ with his hands outspread, in an attitude of invitation.\nOn the pedestal were carved the words: Come unto me. In the process of the restoration of the statue, with the aid of master artists and sculptors, the figure eventually was reassembled except for the hands, of which no fragments could be discovered anywhere in the surrounding rubble. Someone made the suggestion that the artist would have to fashion new hands, since the former hands could not be found. Later came a public protest, couched in the words,'No, leave him without hands.' So today, in the public square of that English city, the restored statue of Christ stands without hands, and on its base are carved the words: Christ has no hands but ours.\nThose twelve hands all betrayed: one positively, eleven negatively. And Christ has no hands except ours, because Christ is a being, PURE being. And all that is to be done is to be done through us, through the hands. In that moment, when Judas betrayed and the remaining eleven fled, Jesus was left without hands, a pure being. In fact, that moment was the moment of crucifixion. The next day, it was nothing new. In that moment, the hands of Christ were cut. In that moment, the real crucifixion happened. The next day was just a repetition of it in more materialistic terms, but spiritually, Jesus was left without hands.\nWHEN THE MORNING WAS COME, ALL THE CHIEF PRIESTS AND ELDERS\nOF THE PEOPLE TOOK COUNSEL AGAINST JESUS TO PUT HIM TO DEATH: AND WHEN THEY HAD BOUND HIM, THEY LED HIM AWAY, AND\nDELIVERED HIM TO PONTIUS PILATE, THE GOVERNOR. AND JESUS\nSTOOD BEFORE THE GOVERNOR, AND THE GOVERNOR ASKED HIM, SAYING: ART THOU THE KING OF THE JEWS? AND JESUS SAID UNTO\nHIM: THOU SAYEST.\nJesus was tremendously misunderstood whenever he talked about the kingdom of God. He never talked about the kingdom of this earth. Whenever he said,'I am the King of the Jews,' he never meant to assert any throne on this earth. He was saying something very symbolically. He was saying that he was the cream of the\nJewish genius. He was saying that he was the heart of the Jewish race. He was saying that he was the flower of the Jewish tree of life. When he said that he was the king, he never meant that he was the king politically.\nBut this is always so: you have to use the language of the people you are talking to, and that very language which you wanted to communicate with becomes the barrier, becomes the cause of all misunderstanding.\nThe people understood the superficial meaning of his words. Had they been a little more in tune with themselves, had they been a little more silent, had they been a little more meditative and prayerful, they would have understood what Jesus was saying.\nMany times I say things to you and immediately I feel that you must have misunderstood me. I have to use words. You hear my words, you cannot hear my meaning -- because the meaning is a silent shadow that follows the word.\nYou hear the word and you supply the meaning. My meaning is lost. Words may be mine, but meanings are yours.\nOnce it happened: A thirsty wanderer in the desert was in despair over finding water. He struggled frantically from one hilltop to the next in an effort to sight a stream which was supposed to be in that region. His eyes searched in every direction, but without success. While staggering through some dry bushes his foot caught on a branch, spilling him to the ground. Exhausted, and dejected, he remained there. Feeling no energy, feeling no motivation to move, feeling nowhere to go, he remained there as if dead on the ground, listening to the surrounding silence. The desert was absolutely silent. There was nothing except silence. Suddenly, his head jerked upwards. He heard something new. It was the faint but definite sound of running water. Strengthened by the sound, he followed it all the way to a clear and cool stream of water.\nA silent but alert mind can hear the first faint invitation to abundant supply and refreshment.\nWhen you are near a man like Jesus, listen to his silence, not to his words.If you only listen to his words you are bound to misunderstand him. Just listen to his silence, and each of his words is followed by silence. In fact, a man like Jesus speaks only so that you can hear his silence. You will say,'Then why does he\nspeak in the first place?' If he did not speak, you would not be able to understand his silence. Speech becomes the contrast, words become the contrast. It is just as if you write on a blackboard with white chalk. You can write on a white board with white chalk, but then it will be impossible to read what is written.\nA man like Jesus speaks: through his words he creates the blackboard, and through his silence, the white chalk. Forget the blackboard. That is just a device to bring silence to your heart, to bring silence to your awareness.\nTHE GOVERNOR ASKED JESUS: ART THOU THE KING OF THE JEWS? AND\nJESUS SAID UNTO HIM: THOU SAYEST.'I am not saying,' he said.'I have not said it. It is you who are saying it. If you say so, it's okay.'\nAND WHEN HE WAS ACCUSED OF THE CHIEF PRIESTS AND ELDERS, HE\nANSWERED NOTHING.\nThis has to be understood also. He answered Pilate; at least he said,'Thou sayest.'\nBut when the priests and the elders accused him of a thousand and one things, he answered nothing. Why?\nPontius Pilate was a stranger. It is possible sometimes to speak to a stranger. It is very difficult to speak to people who think they are familiar with you, who already think that they know you. It is impossible to speak to the people who think they know you, because whatsoever you say is not going to help; they already know you. They will interpret you in the old way, in their way, so that they understand you. Pilate was absolutely a stranger. He was a Roman governor, he was not a Jew. He was not at all concerned with the Jewish religion.\nJesus looked at the governor, and he said,'Thou sayest.' He may have been able to understand Jesus. And the story goes that Pilate felt very much for him. He understood, a little. Being a stranger, it was possible for him to understand this man. At least he could see him without any prejudice. It was none of his concern: he was not a Jew, he was not a priest, he was a foreigner. He could look at this man directly, without any clouds in his mind. He felt for this man. This man looked absolutely innocent. In fact, Pontius Pilate wanted him to be freed.\nTwo more persons were going to be crucified that day: two thieves along with Jesus. And it was the custom that the people could ask for one person to be freed.\nOne person could be freed by the governor, so the governor hoped that they would ask for Jesus to be freed. He even hinted; he sent messages to the elders, to the priests, saying,'It will be good if Jesus can be freed. The man seems to be innocent.' But no, the people wanted his blood. They asked that one of the thieves should be freed, not Jesus.\nA thief, a murderer, was freed and an absolutely innocent man was killed. The man, the thief who was freed, himself became a disciple of Jesus. Seeing the innocence of this man, he could not believe how he had been freed. He was not worthy. The very phenomenon changed his life.\nAND WHEN HE WAS ACCUSED OF THE CHIEF PRIESTS AND ELDERS, HE\nANSWERED NOTHING.\nTHEN SAID PILATE UNTO HIM: HEAREST THOU NOT HOW MANY THINGS THEY WITNESS AGAINST THEE?\nAND HE ANSWERED TO HIM NEVER A WORD; INSOMUCH THAT THE GOVERNOR MARVELLED GREATLY.\nWhy did the governor marvel greatly at the silence of Jesus? His silence was very, very eloquent. His remaining in silence showed much that could not be said. Whenever a person feels guilty he starts defending; that is natural.\nWhenever you feel wrong you start arguing; that is natural. Whenever you feel that something has gone amiss you start rationalizing; that is natural.\nIf you are really innocent, then what is there to defend, argue, rationalize? If you are really innocent, only silence can say anything. Words won't help. Pilate, the governor, must have seen many criminals in his life, all arguing.\nI have heard a story: Once it happened that one great Russian Czar, Peter, went\nto see his prison. Once a year he used to go there, and it was up to him to free anybody. If he took the fancy of freeing anybody, there was nobody to hinder. So he would go from one cell to another, and all the criminals, great criminals, murderers, would say,'Sir, -- we are innocent. We have been unfairly caught.\nSomebody else has done it. Have mercy on us!'\nOnly one man who was accused of murder and was sentenced for his whole life said,'Sir, I am a criminal; I have committed the murder. And I don't feel that even my whole life's imprisonment is enough punishment. Give me more punishment! I feel guilty!'\nPeter said,'Release this rascal immediately! He will corrupt others. All are so innocent but this rascal.' That man was freed immediately.\nInnocence accepts. PURE innocence has nothing to reject, nothing to accept. If you are a criminal, your whole mind will work on how to get out of it. If you accept it, you are already out of it. But Jesus was not a criminal at all. He had not committed any crime. He was the purest soul ever. He had nothing to accept, nothing to reject that's the meaning of his silence.\n'And the governor marvelled'... he had never seen such a silent man, so close to death yet so peaceful; so close to death and so relaxed; so close to death and so un-defensive; so close to death and not trying in any way to save himself -- so surrendered.\nAND HE ANSWERED TO HIM NEVER A WORD; INSOMUCH THAT THE GOVERNOR MARVELLED GREATLY.\nJesus succeeded as a rebel; he failed as a revolutionary. If you ask buddhas, they will say that he succeeded. If you ask ordinary people, they will say that he failed.\nA great crowd had gathered on the day when he was crucified to see whether he was going to do some miracle. They went home frustrated. No miracle happened, no miracle at all. He died silently, as any ordinary man would have died. There was not a difference, not a bit of difference.\nBut I would like to tell you: give flowers to rebels who fail, because all the\nsuccessful ones have always betrayed the revolution.\nEvery revolution has been a betrayed revolution. Only a rebel who fails totally is a real rebel, because to succeed he will have to use the ways and means of this world. And in using those ways and means is the failure. Jesus died a humble man, in total surrender, without any power; this is his success.\nThe church is a failure because the church has succeeded in becoming a great establishment. Now, upon this earth, the Christian church is the greatest establishment. Fords and Rockefellers, Morgans and Carnegies are nothing; the Christian church is the greatest business on the earth today. Other great companies are very, very small companies compared. to the Christian church. It is a world-wide establishment. The church succeeded and failed; Jesus failed and succeeded.\nGive your flowers to rebels who have failed, because they are the truly rebellious people.\nA rebellious person remains individual; there is no other way. He flowers, he blooms, and disappears. He does not leave any trace behind of his success. In fact, there are no proofs to show that Jesus ever existed; except for the Gospel, which is a Christian document, there is no other proof that he ever existed.\nNowhere else is ke mentioned. How has it happened that such a great phenomenon has not left any footprints?\nThe greater the phenomenon, the lesser the footprints in history. The greater the phenomenon, the lesser the footprints in time. He succeeds in eternity; he fails in time. Those who succeed in time fail in eternity.\nGive your flowers to those rebels who have failed.…\nAnd Jesus is the topmost failure in the world. He failed tremendously, he failed beautifully. He is a pinnacle of failure, the climax, because he is a rebel, not a revolutionary. Lenin succeeded, Gandhi succeeded, Mao succeeded; these are revolutionaries, they are not rebels. They all betrayed the revolution. Once a rebellion becomes a revolution, it is already on the path of betrayal.\nIf you really want to be a rebel -- and that is the only way to be a religious person\n-- then you have to be alone. Then you have to be an alone flame in the infinite darkness around; without any organization, without any establishment. You have to live alone. Only God is your companion, nobody else. And that too is not right to say, that God is your companion, because God is your innermost being.\nCome Follow To You, Vol 4 Chapter #8 Chapter title: The whole Sky belongs to You 28 December 1975 am in Buddha Hall The first question:\nQuestion 1\nYOU SAID WE SUFFER BECAUSE OF THE EGO. AND THEN YOU ALSO SAY\nTHAT THE EGO DOES NOT EXIST. MY SUFFERING IS REAL. HOW CAN IT\nBE CAUSED BY SOMETHING THAT IS NOT REAL, THAT DOESN'T EXIST?\nYOU can suffer in a dream, you can suffer in a nightmare. While it lasts, to all practical purposes, it appears real. But when you awake, then you know it was not real, and even then you know that you had suffered. You may still be perspiring, you may still be trembling because of the nightmare. Your heart may still be beating faster than usual. Awake, you know that it was just a dream, but still you suffered. Not only that, but even now when you are awake, there is a hang-over. The after-effects are still continuing.\nYou suffer from an ego which does not exist. In fact, you suffer because it does not exist and you go on believing that it exists. If you believe in something which is not, you are bound to suffer because you will try in every possible way to feel that it exists. But it cannot exist. Just watch: whenever you suffer, watch; where does it hurt? -- you will always find that it is the'I', the ego that hurts.\nYou would like to live a life where there is no suffering, but that life is not possible if you continuously carry the ego with you. You cannot make a life around you so that suffering disappears. If you carry the ego, again and again you will bump into some reality which will hurt the unreal. Whenever there is an encounter between reality and unreality, the unreal causes suffering.\nI have heard one anecdote about a very famous man, Oscar Wilde. At a function where the views of celebrities were being canvassed, Oscar Wilde was asked to compile his list of a hundred best books.'I fear,' said he,'that would be impossible.''Why?' he was asked. He said,'Because I have only written five.'\nYou go on looking at life just from one single point -- you. Humanity used to believe that earth was the center of the universe; and man, of course, the center of the earth; and you, of course, the center of humanity.\nI have heard about a professor of philosophy in the university of Paris. One day he declared,'I am the greatest man in the world!'\nThe disciples laughed: he was a poor philosopher. But whenever;he said something he must mean something, so they asked. And they asked,'You being a logician, please prove it.'\nHe brought a map of the world into the class, and said to the students,'Which is the greatest country in the world? Can you tell me, can you show me?'\nThey were all French, so of course France was the greatest country in the world.\nSo he said,'Now, the whole world is hot the-question. If I can prove that I am the greatest man in France, then I am proved.'\nThey said,'That looks right.' But now they started feeling a little uneasy. He said,'And which is the greatest city in France?'\nOf course, they were all Parisians, so it was Paris. Now they became even more afraid; he was bringing the truth home.\nAnd then he said,'Which is the greatest and the holiest place in Paris?' Of course, it was the university.\n'And which is the greatest department in the university?' Of course, it was the department of philosophy.\nAnd he said,'I am the head of the department!'\nWhen for the first time it was discovered that the earth was not the center of the universe, it damaged the human ego tremendously. The church fought it because it was not only a question of the earth. Deep down it was a question of the human ego: if the earth is not the center, then man cannot be the center; and if earth is just a far-off outer post, and not at the center of existence, then man may be, at the most, a coincidence. The so-called religious people struggled against the idea.\nGalileo was called into the court, an old man, and was asked to confess his sin: that he had committed a mistake, and to admit it. He had said and proved that it is not the sun that moves around the earth; On the contrary, it is the earth that moves around the sun. If the earth moves around the sun, then the sun is the center. He said,'I can admit that I have committed a mistake, and I confess, but there is one thing I must tell: whether I confess, whether I admit it or not, makes no difference. The earth moves around the sun. It will not change its course just because Galileo asks to be forgiven. You can kill me, and I am ready to ask to be forgiven. I am ready to admit that I have committed a mistake, but my admission is not going to help; the earth will go on moving around the sun, the earth is not at the center.'\nWhy was the church so adamant? There was reason in it, very, very significant reason in it: once earth is not at the center, man is not at the center. Then you disappear in a vast universe. In fact, religious people should have been in favor of it because they had been against ego. But then religious people, really religious people, are very rare and few.\nThe whole effort of religion is how to drop the ego. The whole effort is how to penetrate into the phenomenon of the ego and to SEE the unreality of it.\nI It is unreal, and I know your suffering is real. The unreal can cause a real suffering; there is not a problem in it. Because the unreal becomes almost real when you believe in it -- you believe in a ghost, then the ghost is there.\nIn my town, just near my house there was a very old tree. My window was just\nnear the tree, and I didn't like people walking, coming and going, so I spread a rumor that there was a ghost. By and by, it became a reality. First people laughed, but even in their laughter there was fear.\nI had an old servant, so I told him one day to just sit in the tree, and when people passed by, to just create noise. The whole town recognized the fact that this was the truth. My family knew that I wanted absolute silence near that tree so that nobody would pass. But by and by, they also became afraid -- 'Who knows?' I told them,'You know that this is just a trick!' But they said,'When the whole town believes, and nobody walks on that path in the night, and even in the day people are afraid... who knows?'\nOnce you believe, the unreal thing becomes real. Your belief makes it real: then it hurts, then it hurts almost as if it were real. It is only a question of belief. Man is a believing animal. Whatsoever you believe, you make it real by your belief And you can come to know the reality only when you drop all beliefs.\nRemember, you can face reality only when you drop all beliefs, all conceptions about it, and you come naked, nude and empty; carrying no philosophy, no belief, nothing -- not even the belief that'I am'. That too is a belief. Just come empty, innocent, not knowing anything, and then the mystery will be revealed to you; not before it. And the ego is one of the most unreal things; but one wants to believe in it, one wants to be someone. To be nobody needs much courage. To be a nothingness needs infinite daring. Only a Buddha or a Jesus -- rare human beings -- come to realize that emptiness. And through that emptiness is realized the fullness of life.\nThe second question:\nQuestion 2\nSOMETIMES I FEEL I DON'T EXIST. WHEN I COME INTO A ROOM, NO ONE\nSEES ME. WHEN I SPEAK, NO ONE HEARS. WHEN A FRIEND TOUCHES\nME, I AM NOT SOLID. I FEEL LIKE A PIECE OF QUICKSILVER THAT RUNS\nAWAY FROM BETWEEN YOUR FINGERS. HOW CAN I LOSE MYSELF IF\nI AM NOT THERE?\nIt is a very basic question. It has to be understood in many steps.\nFirst: nobody can see you except yourself, because the others can see only. your periphery, not you. They can see your body: they can see your eyes, your face, but not you. You are hidden deep behind. These are all curtains; these are all like clouds. Your light, your flame of life, is hidden deep behind. Nobody can penetrate it, you are impenetrable.\nExcept you, nobody can see you. Except you, nobody can touch you. Except you, nobody can feel who you are.\nPeople can move around and around you, just on the periphery; nobody can reach to the center. Neither can you reach to anybody else's center. The innermost core is absolutely private. Even lovers cannot penetrate it. Deep in love, still you cannot penetrate it.\nThat is the misery of lovers: they would like to penetrate each other, they would like to go as far as possible, they would like to meet and mingle and become one, and all efforts fail. Whatsoever they do, they find that it doesn't succeed.\nSomewhere they remain two. Somewhere the separateness remains. They can forget that they are separate, but they cannot become one.\nThat is the misery of love, the suffering, the anguish, because love would like to become one. Love would like to lose all separateness, all boundaries. But again and again; one comes to the boundary, the limitation.\nSo, this is the first basic fact to understand: that except for yourself, nobody can penetrate your privacy. That is the difference between a rock and you. The rock can be penetrated to the very center; it has no privacy. That is the difference between matter and consciousness.\nMatter has no privacy; consciousness has privacy. Matter can be understood from the outside because matter has no inside. There is nothing like inner in matter; everything is outer. And in consciousness, just the opposite is the case: everything is inner and nothing is outer\nConsciousness is an infinite inwardness.\nConsciousness is depth, matter is surface. Matter is like the waves on the ocean; you, consciousness, you are the depth of the ocean. And this inwardness can never be penetrated because once it is penetrated it becomes a public thing; it becomes an object. It is no more inward, it becomes outward. If somebody can see you, you are reduced to an object, to a thing. You are not a man then. Try to understand this. That's why whenever somebody looks at you, stares at you, you feel uneasy.\nIn Hindi we call that type of man LUCHA. The word means: one who stares at you. The word LUCHA comes from LOCHAN; LOCHAN means: the eye. One who goes on staring at you, goes on staring at you, is violating, is trespassing. He is not civilized. He is incivil, uncultured.\nThere is a certain limit, a time limit: psychologists have come to discover that it is near about three seconds. If for three seconds you look at somebody there is no problem, it is just a casual look. Two strangers can look at each other passing on the road for three seconds. Up to that time, it is a casual look. If it is longer than that, then the look becomes not casual. Now you are trying to penetrate the other person. If you love the person it can be allowed, because lovers are open to each other. But if you don't love the person and the person doesn't love you, then you are offending. Then this is violence. Then you are trespassing on the privacy of the other person, and the other person will feel offended, will feel uneasy. He will retaliate. Why? -- watch: you are sitting alone in your room; you are totally a different person. Then somebody comes in; you immediately change because two eyes have come. You are no more in private. You are taking your bath in the bathroom, humming, making faces in the mirror, and then suddenly you become aware that somebody is looking through the keyhole; you change. That gaze, that look penetrates you like a sharp sword. You are no more -- the humming stops --\nyour privacy has been violated.\nWhy do you feel offended if somebody is looking through the keyhole? --\nbecause you have been reduced to a thing. Your subjectivity has not been respected. You are not a thing. Your permission should be asked before somebody looks at you. Without your permission, somebody looking at you like a thief is offending you. He is creating a thing out of you. You are a consciousness, a subjectivity. You cannot be reduced to a thing.\nWherever you feel that you are reduced to a thing, you don't feel free, you don't feel good, you don't feel happy. You feel very, very suppressed. That's the misery in being a slave, or being a servant. You are reading a newspaper, sitting in your room; your servant passes by -- you don't even look at him, you don't even recognize that a man has passed. It is as if a robot has passed, a mechanism, not a man. You don't say hello, you don't say good morning. Nothing is needed, he is a servant. You treat the man as if he had no inwardness, he is just outside, a servant. A servant is a role; it is not his being. He feels -- it hurts that he has been taken as a thing.\nYou go to a prostitute: you pay because you will make love to her, she feels hurt because she is not a commodity-but you reduce her to a commodity. Life somehow has forced her to be a thing in the market. Even the ugliest woman is more beautiful than the most beautiful prostitute, because to be a woman and not to be a thing gives a grace, a dignity. Even the most beautiful prostitute is ugly. And people who go to her must be people who don't have any aesthetic sense. How can you make love to a woman if you have reduced her first to be a thing? You are making love to a dummy. You are making love to a dead body, a corpse. You are making love to your money. You are not making love to a person, because a person is an inwardness, and a person cannot be purchased.\nAlways watch around yourself, and you will see that the person is elusive. You can catch hold of the body, but not the soul. Nobody can do that.\nThe question is,'Sometimes I feel I don't exist. When I come into a room no one sees me' -- no one CAN see you. Just because nobody can see you, don't think that you are not. In fact, the vice-versa would have been a curse: if people could see you, you would be a thing, a chair, a rock.\nFeel blessed that nobody can see you, howsoever they try. Even if they brought magnifying glasses they could not see you. You are elusive -- this is your subjectivity, this is your soul, this is your dignity. This is the beauty and the mystery of life: that nobody can see you except you. This is your privacy.\nBeautiful is the world, because at least one thing is private -- your own consciousness. Otherwise everything would be sold in the marketplace. It cannot be objectified. That's what the Upanishads say: The knower cannot be known; the seer cannot be seen. The knower can feel himself, the seer can see himself.\nSecondly: because you cannot be seen by others, how can you ask that God should be seen by you? Even a human being has such a privacy deep within him that nobody can penetrate it, so what to say about God?\nPeople come to me and they say,'Tell us how to see God' -- foolish people. They think that they are very, very intelligent and they are asking a very intelligent question. Not even human consciousness has ever been seen; how can you see the consciousness of the whole? You can become one with it, but cannot see. You can dissolve in it, but you cannot see it.\nl have heard an anecdote: When Yuri Gagarin came back from space, many questions were asked of him. One of those questions was,'Did you meet God in space?' Yuri Gagarin is reported to have said,'I have been out in space and didn't see God; therefore, there is no God.' Now these words are emblazoned on the walls of the anti-God museum in Leningrad. On the very gate; in gold letters, these words are emblazoned: I have been out in space and didn't see God; therefore, there is no God.\nThe first thing that Yuri Gagarin should ask is -- can HE be seen? Has anybody ever seen Yuri Gagarin's privacy, his innermost soul? God is not in outer space, because God is not matter. God is in the inner space because God is absolute consciousness. Man is partial consciousness; even that cannot be seen, so what to say about the total, about the whole?\nJust because you cannot be seen, don't think that you are not. You are, but you are not an object. You are subjectivity. You are the seer, not the seen. You see, but you cannot be seen. Your nature is to be a seer, a witness; your nature is not to be an object.\n'When I speak, no one hears. When a friend touches me, I am not solid.'\nNobody can touch you. All that can be touched is not you. And I know -- that which can be touched is not solid at all. The body is flowing, continuously flowing.\nAsk the physiologists. They say that within seven years the body becomes completely new. Not even a single cell remains old. It is a river-like flow, continuously flowing. It looks solid, just the wall looks solid, but it is not. All the physicists say that the wall is in flux. The atoms are running at the same speed as light, moving continuously. The movement is so fast and the speed is so\ntremendous that you cannot see the movement. You cannot see the speed, and the wall appears to be solid.\nYour body is a continuous flux -- like a river it is flowing. But the flux is so fast that you cannot see. And you think that it is substantial, solid -- it is not. Neither is your mind solid: thoughts are continuously moving. Like clouds, forms come and disappear.\nBut you? -- you are not a flux, you are not a changing phenomenon. You are eternity. I am not saying that you are solid. You are neither solid nor liquid; you transcend all categories. You are just space, tremendous emptiness. And out of that emptiness all of these flowers flower.\nYou are flowers of emptiness, forms of nothingness.\nThat's what we mean when we say,'God has no form, but you are all His forms.\nGod has no names, but all names belong to Him.' The formless descends into millions of forms, and the nameless takes millions of names.\nNobody can touch you, nobody can see you, nobody can hear you; because all these hearings, seeings, touchings -- they belong to the body, not to you. You are always the elusive, that which eludes; the mysterious, the unknown and the unknowable.\nBut because of this, don't start feeling that you are not. You are, but you are subjectivity, irreducible to an object. This is the whole effort of meditation: to bring you to the point where you can fall into your own subjectivity, where you can disappear into your own depth, where you can come to realize that which is abiding in you -- unborn, undying, eternal.\n'How can I lose myself if I am not here?' -- just to understand this is to lose. The'I'\nthat you think you are is not you; and the you that you are, you have not even thought about. The'I' that you think you are is the'I' that is seen by others, touched by others, heard by others, loved by others, hated by others. The'I', the ego, is nothing but the opinions of others that you have gathered about yourself.\nThis'I' you are not, but you are identified with it. You are that'I' which has never\nbeen seen by anybody, which has never been touched by anybody. Uncorrupted, untouched, uncontaminated, virgin, absolutely pure, purity itself; that you are.\nDrop that which you are not so that you can know that which you are. My whole teaching is: just to drop that which you are not. It looks paradoxical. I am telling you to renounce that which you don't have. Throw away that which you don't have so that which you are can become manifested to you, can be revealed to you.\nThe third question:\nQuestion 3\nWHEN I WORKED WITH GURDJIEFF PEOPLE, THEY TOLD ME TO MAKE\nAN EFFORT, STRUGGLE, WORK. WHEN I WORKED WITH BUDDHIST\nMASTERS, THEY TOLD ME NOT TO TO, JUST SIT. YOU SAY BOTH. I FIND\nTHAT AT TIMES I'M CONFUSED.\nYes. I say both, and I can understand your confusion.\nGurdjieff follows the path of will. He says,'Bring tremendous effort -- to the very climax, so that you can become crystallized. Struggle hard, make all the efforts that you can.'\nIf you go to Zen Masters, Buddhists, they believe in effortlessness, they believe in surrender. They don't believe in struggle. They say,'Drop all efforts. Just sit silently, don't do anything: non-doing. Someday it will happen; because it cannot be done, it happens.'\nBoth are clear-cut. If you follow Gurdjieff, you are against Zen people. If you follow Zen, you are against Gurdjieff. Things are clear-cut, logical. With me, confusion is bound to be there, because I say both. I say work hard. I say bring your total energy into effort so that one day effort can be dropped and you can become effortless. To me, will brings you to Surrender, and effort brings you to effortlessness. Let me give you a few examples, then it will be possible for you\nto understand.\nLin Chi, a great Zen Master, worked with his own Master for years. The Master taught him painting; through painting he was teaching him meditation. For twelve years, Lin Chi worked. Then he became perfect, he became the greatest painter. Then the Master said,'Now, your effort is complete. Now throw these brushes, these colors, these paintings, and forget all about painting.'\nTwelve years' effort, day and night; and this Master was a hard taskmaster. After such effort, arduous hardship, something had been attained; and then the Master said,'Throw it away.' The Master has to be followed; Lin Chi threw the brushes, the ink, the paintings, and forgot all about it.\nSix years passed and then the Master said,'Now you can start painting.' Lin Chi asked,'What is the meaning of it?'\nThe Master said,'Now you have attained to effortless effort.'\nFirst, one has to learn effort. Then one has to learn effortlessness. If in your art your art is present, then it is not great art. If you paint and effort is present, you are not a great master yet because the very effort shows that you are not one when you are painting. If you sing and in singing effort is present, then you are not a great singer. You are still trying hard to prove something. When you have really become a great singer, effort drops; you sing spontaneously. Your singing becomes like the singing of the birds; your singing becomes spontaneous.\nThe great musician is one who can touch, who can play on his organ not knowing what he is going to do. He himself is surprised when something happens. Not only is the audience the audience, he himself is part of the audience. The great master becomes a vehicle, surrendered. But to attain to that surrender, you have to purify yourself.\nTremendous effort is needed before you can become capable of dropping it. If you want to offer your will to God -- that is what surrender is -- first make it worthy. With ugly egos, stinking, you go to God and you want to offer it. Go with flowers. Let yourself become a flower, a fragrance first, and then.… If you just go and sit what do you think -- that something is going to happen? Nothing will happen; the market will go on moving in the mind. You can -go on sitting like a statue, dead.\nWhen Bokuju reached his Master, the Master asked,'For what have you come?'\nHe said,'Get out! We have one thousand dead Buddhas already here.' Because he used to live in a temple which had one thousand stone Buddhas. He said,'Get out immediately! The place is already much too crowded with Buddhas. We don't need any more.'\nWhat was he saying? He was saying,'You will be a stone Buddha if you just sit.'\nYou can learn the posture, you can learn the trick of sitting for hours, but what will happen to your mind? You may be sitting in a temple but you will not be there, you will be somewhere else. You are always there where your desire is.\nTo drop effort, you will have to learn what effort is. Gurdjieff is the beginning; Zen is the end. Gurdjieff is the ABCD; Zen is the XYZ. You can reach to Zen only if you have passed Gurdjieff. If you try to reach directly to Zen, you will never reach.\nThis is what is happening in the West now. Zen has been absolutely misunderstood. Go to Japan and see the Japanese monasteries: a Zen monk has to work hard for twenty years, twenty-four years, even thirty years. He has to meditate six hours, eight hours, ten hours, twelve hours, even eighteen hours per day. Then comes a moment when the Master says,'Now relax.' Only at the peak is relaxation allowed.\nIn the West, Zen has been very, very misunderstood. It is very easy to misunderstand Zen because the language is so poetic. The language is so paradoxical that in the West, a hippie-type Zen has come into existence.'There is nothing to do,' Zen people say. There is nowhere to go,' Zen people say. It fits perfectly with your laziness.\nYou sit, you be lazy; not doing anything, not going anywhere -- you will not become a Buddha. Buddha himself worked hard for six years in his last life. If you count his past lives, then for millions of lives he had been working hard. But in his last life, when he became enlightened, he also worked very hard. Then one day he dropped -- he became enlightened. When people asked,'How did you attain?' he said,'By dropping all effort.' He's true, but he can be misunderstood.\nFirst, you need effort to drop it one day. You don't have effort yet; how can you drop it? If you want to sit silently, you will have to run for miles and miles, and\nonly then can you sit silently. To drop thinking you will have to think for miles and miles and miles; only then can you understand the futility of it all. In that understanding, thinking stops.\nSo I may appear confusing to you; that is your misunderstanding. I am simply making it a whole. Gurdjieff is half -- just technique, just work. Zen is also misunderstood and has become half because of the misunderstanding -- doing nothing. I teach you to do, to do much, so that one day you can attain to the flower of non-doing. You can simply sit not doing anything, not even meditating.\nThere is the reality -- when you are not doing anything and all the ripples of the mind have subsided, and your whole being is simply silent. This is not laziness.\nThis is tremendous energy; unmotivated, not going anywhere. It is a reservoir of energy, not laziness. You are full of energy, tremendously at the peak of energy, but not going anywhere because there is no goal to reach, nothing to achieve, no desire left. Not even is God a desire now. Not even is MOKSHA, NIRVANA, the final attainment, a desire now. All desires have left; one is sitting at home.\nIn that moment, the whole comes to you. The whole existence caves in upon you from every direction and every dimension. You are accepted. You become a.lotus flower. Without any effort, you just float on the water. The water does not touch you, cannot touch you. You remain in the world and not of the world.\nI teach you both effort and effortlessness, because unless you attain to effortless- effort, unless you attain to active passivity, unless you attain to a singing-silence\n-\n- they look paradoxical -- unless you attain to an unmoving dance, you have not attained.\nSo please don't misinterpret it as confusion. What I am saying to you is a mystery. If you look at it logically, it will look like confusion. If you look at it through love, it will look a mystery. It is a mystery; you only need to have a look through love. Then you will immediately understand, and then you will connect the polarity, and you will see that much activity is needed to attain to passivity.\nThe fourth question: Question 4\nIT HAS BEEN A YEAR NOW SINCE I HAVE TAKEN SANNYAS, BUT WHEN I HEAR YOU DESCRIBE WHAT A SANNYASIN IS, I DON'T FEEL LIKE ONE.\nThis is how a sannyasin is always expected to feel. Once you feel that you have arrived, you have already gone astray. The very feeling that one has arrived is.\negoistic. One goes on learning and learning and learning, and it never becomes knowledge. One goes on moving and moving, one comes closer and closer to the goal, but the goal is never achieved because the goal is infinite -- it cannot be achieved, you cannot grab it.\nIf you are a real sannyasin, you will always be aware that much has to be done yet. You will never be satisfied. Life is so vast; only mediocre minds become satisfied. Life is so big; only small minds can think that they have attained. The more you understand, the more you will see that you don't understand. The more you know, the more you will know that you don't know. The ultimate of knowledge is to become as ignorant as a small child, not knowing anything. In that innocence is the goal.\nRemain always discontented; then you grow. Then growth knows no limits. To become a God is to go on growing. God is not a thing, it is an on-going process. It is infinite movement. To become a God means: to realize that the existence goes on and on. It is a continuous discovery of new continents of being. And being is infinite, so it is not going to end any day. It is never going to end.\nThe journey starts, but never ends. The sixth question:\nQuestion 5\nDAY BY DAY, NEAR YOU, I FIND MYSELF LIKING MY SADNESS. WHAT IS\nHAPPENING TO ME, OSHO?\nThat's how it should be. If you can like your sadness also, then the sadness is no longer sad. The sadness is sad because you dislike it. The sadness is sad because you would not like to be in it. The sadness is sad because you reject it. Even\nsadness becomes a flowering of tremendous beauty, of silence, of depth, if you like it. Nothing is wrong; that's what I want you to be: to like everything that happens, even sadness. Even death has to be loved; only then will you transcend death. If you can accept death, love and welcome it, now death cannot kill you; you have transcended it.\nWhen sadness comes, accept it. Listen to its song. It has something to give to you.\nIt has a gift which no happiness can give to you, only sadness can give it.\nHappiness is always shallow; sadness, always deep. Happiness is like a wave, sadness is like the innermost depth of an ocean. In sadness you remain with yourself, left alone. In happiness you start moving with people, you start sharing In sadness you close your eyes; you delve deep within yourself. Sadness has a song -- a very deep phenomenon is sadness. Accept it. Enjoy it. Taste it without any rejection, and you will see that it brings many gifts to you which no happiness can ever bring.\nAnd if you can accept sadness, it is no more sadness. You have brought a new quality to it. You will grow through it. Now it will not be a stone, a rock on the path blocking the way; it will become a step.\nAnd remember always: a person who has not known deep sadness is a poor person. He will never have an inner richness. A person who has lived always happy, smiling, shallow, has not entered into the innermost temple of his being.\nHe has missed the innermost shrine.\nRemain capable of moving with all the polarities. When sadness comes, be REALLY sad. Don't try to escape from it -- allow it, cooperate with it. Let it dissolve in you and you be dissolved in it. Become one with it. Be really sad: no resistance, no conflict, no struggle. When happiness comes, be happy: dance, be ecstatic. When happiness comes, don't try to cling to it. Don't say that it should remain always and always; that is the way to miss it. When sadness comes, don't say,'Don't come to me,' or,'If you have come, please go soon.' That is the way to miss it.\nDon't reject sadness and don't cling to happiness. and soon you will understand that happiness and sadness are two aspects of the same coin. Then you will see\nthat happiness also has a sadness in it, and sadness also has a happiness in it.\nThen your inner being is enriched. Then you can enjoy everything: the morning and the evening also, the sunlight and the dark night also, the day and the night, the summer and the winter, life and death -- you can enjoy all.\nWhen you don't have a choice, you are already transcendental. You have transcended. Then the duality doesn't divide you. You remain undivided. And this is ADWAIT; this is what Shankara means when he says 'non-dualism'; this is what the Upanishads teach: to be non-dual, to be one.\nTo be one means not to choose, because once you choose your choice divides you. You say,'I would like to be happy, and I don't want to be unhappy'; you are divided. You simply say,'Whatsoever happens, everything is welcome. My doors are open. Sadness comes; come be my guest. Happiness comes; come be my guest. I will be a host to everything, with no rejection, with no choice, with no like, no dislike.'\nSuddenly, nobody can divide you. You have attained to an inner unity, to an inner melody, to an inner music, an inner harmony.\nThe seventh question:\nQuestion 6\nLOVE IS THE POINT. WHEN YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT LOVE, I FEEL LIKE\nI AM FACING A GUN. MAY I CALL YOU MY GANGSTER OF LOVE?\nExactly, that's what I am. And you are facing a gun; you are facing death.\nTo face love is to face death, because one who is not ready to die, to die to the ego, will not be capable of love. And you are not imprisoned by anybody else; it is your own ego, a false notion of yourself which is imprisoning you. Drop it! --\nand the whole existence with all its beauty becomes available to you.\nI will tell you one story. It happened: A man fell heir to some property near the seashore. He wandered for a while in quiet enjoyment of his land, then decided\nto stroll down to the ocean. With the pleasant anticipation of sighting waves and\n-- sand, he followed the downward path, but he came to a sudden halt as a tall wall blocked his; path. With disappointment, he reflected to himself, -- 'Someone does not want me to trespass on his property. Well, it is his wall. There is nothing I can do.'\nOver the days, he felt a mounting urge to have direct access to the sea. He made up his mind to locate the owner of the frustrating wall. Checking land records, he identified the wall's owner. He then knew who blocked his path, and who could therefore open the way. The wall was on his own property; it was his own.\nWe block our own path; we can unblock ourselves.\nNobody is barring your path. You are heir to infinite possibilities. You are walling your own path blocking your own path. So whenever I talk about love, of course, you immediately become aware of the wall that surrounds you.\nWhenever I talk about love, you become aware of your imprisonment, naturally.\nWhenever I talk about freedom, if you are a prisoner you become aware of your prison. And you don't like that, because every time freedom is talked about you become aware that you are a prisoner. That you don't like. People in the prison don't like to talk about freedom. That hurts.\nLove is absolute freedom; it is freedom of consciousness. Love knows no bounds, no boundaries. And unless you drop all boundaries, you will not be able to know love. Love is another name for God, and a better name, because the name'God'\nhas been corrupted by the religious people. It has already become a commodity in the marketplace. Love is another name for God, and I say, a better one.\nAnd your feeling is right: that whenever I talk about it, you feel as if you are facing a gun. You are facing it; don't try to escape. Accept the death in love, accept surrender, trust. Because as you are, you 're just a beggar. I would like you to be emperors. Only lovers are emperors, nobody else.\nBut for that, you will have to pay a price. It is nothing in fact: the price is to drop the ego.\nThe eighth question:\nQuestion 7\nI HAVE IMBIBED MUCH OF YOUR GRACE BY WAY OF SHAKTIPAT, BUT\nAMIDST ATTRACTION AND DISTRACTION, I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO\nRETAIN IT. DOES THE VICIOUS CIRCLE OF GAIN AND LOSS\nCONTINUOUSLY GO ON? UNDER SUCH A PLIGHT, IT HAS BECOME VERY\nDIFFICULT TO TAKE A JUMP. UNLESS YOU VIRTUALLY PULL ME OUT OF\nTHE GRAVITY OF EGO, THE FINAL ENLIGHTENMENT SEEMS TO BE IMPOSSIBLE.\nThe final enlightenment can never be forced by anybody on you. It is your freedom to choose it or reject it. At the most, I can give you an invitation; nothing more can be done. And the whole problem is that you are not surrendering. On the contrary, you are trying to use me; and these two things are totally different.\nWhen you surrender, you surrender. Then you don't bother about the final enlightenment. Then you say,'Whatsoever happens is good' If you want to use me, then you are always worried:'The enlightenment is not happening, the SAMADHI is not happening'; this is not happening, that is not happening. And then, by and by, you start feeling a certain grudge, a complaint against me, as if I am not pulling you out. Nobody can pull you out; only you can jump out of it. In the first place, nobody has forced and placed you there. You have entered into it, and you will have to come out of it. I can give you a hand, but you will have to hold my hand. In fact, my hand will not bring you out; that will be just an excuse.\nI will tell you one story.\nA Quaker put a sign on a vacant piece of ground next to his home.'I will give this to anyone who is really satisfied.' A wealthy farmer read it as he rode by.\nStopping, he said,'Since my Quaker friend is going to give that lot away, I may as well have it as anyone else. I am rich, I have all I need, so I am able to qualify.' He went up to the door and explained why he had come.'And is thee really satisfied?' asked the Quaker.'Yes, I have all I need and am well satisfied.''Friend,'\nrejoined the Quaker,'if thee is satisfied, what does thee want with my lot?'\nIf something is really happening to you, if you feel that through SHAKTIPAT\nsomething is happening to you by being near me, then you will forget all about final enlightenment. Because, even that much is too much. You will feel grateful for it. You will not ask more. You will say,'I was not worthy even of this. I am grateful.' And if you can feel that, more will become possible; because one who feels grateful becomes capable of achieving more, attracting more.\nThrough gratefulness you attract grace. Gratefulness is the magnetic force that brings grace to you, but you don't seem to be satisfied with it. In fact, the same questioner has been asking many questions about final enlightenment again and again. I have not been answering, because those questions are meaningless.\nBe here and now in this moment with me, and forget about the future. If you can be here and now, totally with me, happy, grateful, the future is bound to come of its own accord. Enlightenment comes; nobody can bring it. You just be ready.\nOpen your doors, windows; the wind will blow and the wind will bring many fragrances; the sun will come and the sunrays will enter into the darkest corner of your house. Nobody can bring those winds, nobody can bring the sunrays.\nYou can simply remain open, that's all. Being open is all.\nAnd remember the human tendency, the tendency of the human mind, that first it clings to worldly things: money, power, prestige; then it leaves them, frustrated. Then it starts clinging to God, SAMADHI, enlightenment, MOKSHA; but the mind is the same.\nAll clinging must go. All desire must disappear. Only in a desireless moment, that for which you are asking. happens -- but only in a desireless moment.\nPeople come to me and they say,'Teach us how to be desireless.' Now they are desiring desirelessness, which is foolish, which is not possible. You cannot desire desirelessness. You can simply understand the futility of desire -- that it leads nowhere. Understanding it, it drops. Suddenly you are desireless.\nLet me tell you a story, a very famous and very old story.\nBHAGAWAT PUBRANA tells the story of a crow who was flying with a piece of meat in its beak. Twenty crows were pressing it, pursuing it, fighting with it, trying to grab the meat. Flying high to escape them, it became tired, wounded.\nSuddenly, it dropped the meat, and the twenty crows flew down shrieking, fighting for it. Then the crow, flying high, thought,'How good it is to carry nothing. The whole sky belongs to me.'\nHe was just carrying a piece of meat in his mouth, and that piece of meat was creating the whole trouble: twenty crows were fighting, hurting him, trying to grab the piece of meat. Once the piece dropped, those fighters all went away. The crow was left alone. And beautiful is the sentence: The whole sky belongs to me.\nOnce desires disappear, the meat of desire is dropped, the whole sky belongs to you. That is the meaning of enlightenment. Enlightenment is not a thing, it is the infinite space, without desire.…\nThe whole sky belongs to you. Come Follow To You, Vol 4 Chapter #9\nChapter title: Eli, Eli, Lamasabachthani 29 December 1975 am in Buddha Hall Matthew 27 26 THEN RELEASED HE BARABBAS UNTO THEM, AND WHEN HE HAD SCOURGED JESUS, HE DELIVERED HIM TO BE CRUCIFIED.\n46 AND ABOUT THE NINTH HOUR JESUS CRIED OUT WITH A LOUD VOICE, SAYING: ELI, ELI, LAMASABACHTHANI? THAT IS TO SAY: MY GOD, MY GOD, WHY HAST THOU FORSAKEN ME?\n47 SOME OF THEM THAT STOOD THERE, WHEN THEY HEARD THAT SAID: THIS MAN CALLETH FOR ELIAS.\n48 AND STRAIGHTWAY ONE OF THEM RAN AND TOOK A SPONGE AND\nFILLED IT WITH VINEGAR AND PUT IT ON A REED, AND GAVE HIM TO\nDRINK.\n49 THE REST SAID: LET BE. LET US SEE WHETHER ELIAS WILL COME TO\nSAVE HIM.\n50 JESUS, WHEN HE HAD CRIED AGAIN WITH A LOUD VOICE, YIELDED\nUP THE GHOST.\n51 AND BEHOLD, THE VEIL OF THE TEMPLE WAS RENT IN TWAIN FROM\nTHE TOP TO THE BOTTOM, AND THE EARTH DID QUAKE, AND THE ROCKS RENT;\n52 AND THE GRAVES WERE OPENED; AND MANY BODIES OF THE SAINTS\nWHICH SLEPT AROSE,\n53 AND CAME OUT OF THE GRAVES AFTER HIS RESURRECTION, AND WENT INTO THE HOLY CITY, AND APPEARED UNTO MANY.\nNOTHING is new under the sun, and nothing is old also. It all depends on the mind. If the mind is old, then everything is old; if the mind is new, then everything is new. And a new mind is a no-mind; only an old mind is a mind.\nMind means the past, the accumulated past, the accumulated dust of the past.\nMind is a rut, a routine. It is never new. It goes on repeating itself: it is like a gramophone record, stuck. The needle is stuck somewhere, and it goes on repeating the same line, the same line. Centuries have passed, but the mind continues behaving in the same pattern. It killed Socrates, poisoned him. It crucified Jesus, it killed Mansur, and nothing has changed yet. If Jesus comes again, he is going to be crucified.\nI have heard a very beautiful story. It is a Sufi joke of tremendous import: A Bektasi dervish -- Bektasi is an order of Sufis, one of the most important orders, very revolutionary -- a Bektasi dervish approached a certain bishop and said,'I have heard of a young man who harangues crowds, advocates their breaking the law, claims supernatural connections, performs miracles, and contradicts himself.'\n'Enough,' said the bishop,'he shall be tried, charged with blasphemy and upsetting public order. If he does not recant, he may be put to death as a heretic and a corruptor. Just tell me his name and I shall arrange his arrest.'\n'I wish you could realize how impressed I am by your competence,' said the Bektasi dervish.'His name is Jesus.'\nEven Christians would kill him if he came again. It is not only that Jews killed him; it was nothing to do with Jews. Let me repeat it: it had nothing to do with Jews. It has something to do with the mind itself. If he comes again, Christians will crucify him, because he will bring again the new and the fresh; and the mind is old, and is always afraid of the new and the fresh. He will again bring the unknown, and the mind is the known, and the known is always apprehensive of the unknown. He will again bring insecurity, and the mind is always in search of security. He will bring chaos and the mind wants a comfortable, convenient life, although a comfortable, convenient life is not a real life -- the more comfortable, the less alive. The most comfortable life is in the grave.\nIf you are alive there is inconvenience. If you are alive there are challenges. If you are alive then every moment you have to face reality, encounter reality. Every moment you have to be ready to change and to move. Reality has no security and that is its beauty. Life has no security and that is its beauty. Because there is no security, there is adventure. Because the future is unknown, nobody\nknows what is going to happen the next moment. That's why there is challenge, growth, adventure. If you miss adventure, you miss all. If your life is not that of an adventure, of a search into the unknown, then you are living in vain.\nJesus, or a man like Jesus, always brings the unknown to you. He always brings the challenge. The comfortable mind, the settled mind, feels danger. Either Jesus will kill your mind, or you will have to kill Jesus to save your mind. These are the only two alternatives. Either you can go with Jesus -- then by and by you will dissolve -- or you will have to kill Jesus before he attracts you.\nLet me say it in this way: Jews killed Jesus not because he was against them, but because deep down, they were attracted towards him -- a deep attraction, a deep magnetism. That was the only way to protect themselves. Jews were not trying to kill him, they were simply trying to protect themselves. This man was dangerous; he was opening a window into adventure, He was calling them for a challenge, to go on a hazardous journey, to a pilgrimage without any maps, on a pilgrimage which wasuncharted. He was calling them to come to the wild sea, and they were secure on their banks. They had made small houses of convenience, and they were clinging to the bank. And this man went on calling them, this man went on haunting them, this man became a constant danger.\nThey killed him to protect themselves. Don't be angry against them. If you are angry against them you miss the whole point\nJesus will be killed again if he comes -- now Christians will kill him because the same problem will arise again. Now Christianity is a settled thing, and religion can never be a settled thing.\nReligion is a continuity in revolution; a continuous revolution. It is never a fixed thing. It is always a process, because religion is life. A church is just a graveyard.\nDead religion becomes a church; dead religion becomes Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism. Alive religion is Jesus, Buddha: it has a totally different flavor.\nChristians will do the same because he again brings the wildness into your settled world. He again brings the chaotic into your so-called ordered life. He brings disorder, he is an anarchist. He brings anarchy. He is a rebel who destroys all with which you feel comfortable. Why is it so? Why is he so much against\nlaw, order? -- because he knows a greater law, because he knows a greater order.\nLet me explain it to you. There are two types of order in the world: one man- made, another divine. Man-made order is just a make believe. It is not really order, it only hides disorder. Deep down the anarchy continues. On the surface you are befooled, as if there is an order. Just the opposite is the case with the divine order. On the surface there is chaos, and deep down in the depths there is order. On the surface there are great waves, and the ocean is silent deep within.\nThe center has a cosmos in it, and the periphery has a chaos on it. That is divine order. The human order is chaos within, a cosmos just on the periphery, skin deep at the most.\nJesus brings disorder, chaos, because he knows that unless your periphery is in disorder, you will not be able to move towards your innermost core. When your periphery is in disorder, there is no way to go except within. When outside there is disorder and anarchy, where do you move, where do you go, where do you search and seek for a home? -- you start moving inwards, you come to your center. When you think that everything is okay outside, nothing is wrong, who bothers to go in? Only when the outside life is in chaos is the inner life born. The inner life is possible only in an outer chaos.\nAll great religious people are rebels; they have to be. They have to destroy your illusion of order so that you can come to seek and search for the real order. It is what Lao Tzu calls the Tao.'Tao' means the real order which is not man-made, which is just part of reality, intrinsic to it. It is not the laws that man has managed to make, but the Law out of which man is born. Remember, there are many man-made laws, but there is only one Law, the Tao; what Buddha calls the DHAMMA.\nJesus brings disorder to make you alert. He is like an alarm he wants to awake you but you feel offended. He disturbs your sleep, and maybe you were having a beautiful dream. He disturbs your dream. You want him not to disturb you. And yet there is a deep attraction because his call appeals to your depth; it is from depth to depth. Your mind says no, but your innermost being starts saying yes --\nthat is the fear. The Jews were not afraid of what Jesus was saying, the Jews were afraid because they were feeling, deep down, an attraction, a call, an appeal. By murdering Jesus they defended themselves. They defended their own\nperiphery against their own center. Or, you can say, they defended the man-made order against the God-made order. They defended the law of Moses against the law of God Himself. That's what is meant when Jesus says,'Moses brings law to you, I bring love.' Love is the Tao.\nHave you watched? -- love is the most undisciplined and yet the most disciplined thing in the world; the most anarchic and yet the most disciplined thing in the world. When you love a person you don't follow any rules; all rules are thrown overboard. When you love a person, rules are not needed. They are needed only when you don't love a person. But then love brings its own rule, then love brings its own order. If you love me, then that very love brings a certain discipline. If you don't love me, then rules are to be forced. In old Indian scriptures it is said that whenever there is a Master, there is discipline. It is not that he forces discipline; just his presence and the love that he creates around him, brings its own discipline. Love has no discipline, and yet, love and ONLY\nlove has the real discipline. When Jesus says,'I bring love to you,' he means: I bring a certain discipline of the innermost being, of the center.\nBut people who were the guardians of the law naturally became afraid. They had to defend -- the society, the 'law, the discipline, the temple, the religion -- Jesus was a danger to everything. When they started to understand, or misunderstand Jesus, when they heard him, by and by they became aware of certain things --\ncertain things which were their securities, which were their comforts; certain things to which they were clinging and avoiding life; certain things, like walls, prisons, in which they were hiding and feeling safe. Jesus started shaking them out of their sleep. They could not see who Jesus was, they could not see him directly. They could see him only in relation to the securities which were going to be broken by this man. He was a tremendous phenomenon, but they could see only a few points.\nAnd that is how it always happens. What I am saying to you, you are not listening to its totality. Only to a few things do you listen which are in some way related to you in some way disturb you, or in some way console you. You don't listen to me, you listen to me in reference to yourself. And because of that reference, everything becomes confused. You lose clarity.\nLet me tell you a story.\nThere is a story about a man who went to a dictionary compiler and asked him why he was so interested in sex. The lexicographer was quite surprised, and said,'Wherever did you get that idea?'\n'From your own writings!' said the angry visitor.\n'But I have only written that one dictionary. That's all of my writing,' said the author.\n'I know,' said the visitor,'and that is the book which I have read.'\n'But the book contains a hundred thousand words, and out of those I don't suppose that more than a dozen words are about sex.'\n'What are you talking about all the other words for,' said the visitor,'when I was asking you about the words for sex!'\nOne hundred thousand words, but this man had read only the twelve words about sex. He must have been a celibate, he must have been suppressing sex. Out of a hundred thousand words, only a few words are important to him. In fact, for other words he is almost blind; only for those few words is he not blind.\nWhen you read a book, you never read the book that the author has written. You read some other book that you can read. When you listen to me, it is not to what I am saying that you listen. You may hear what I am saying, but you don't listen to what I am saying. You listen only to certain things which are in a certain way relevant to your mind. Hearing is not difficult, listening is the problem. Listening means that you don't choose.\nWhen Jesus, or a man like Jesus, explodes, the explosion is vast. He brings millions of suns in him; the light is tremendous and infinite. But you start thinking about yourself. You become worried about your own small luxuries, comforts, conveniences -- trivia. You become afraid about these things and you start defending yourself because this man attracts your center. Mind is the periphery, being is the center -- this man attracts your being. And let me tell you: when you crucify Jesus, you crucify your own being in favor of your mind.\nWhen you kill Jesus, you kill your own being in favor of your periphery. When Jews killed Jesus on that day, they decided to be in favor of the mind against their own being. Jesus was their essence. He was the very essence, the very\nflowering of their whole history. He was the very purpose of their whole being here. But they decided -- they decided in favor of the mind, and crucified being.'\nJesus is BEING crucified.\nAnd this is not only an historic thing that once happened, and now you are finished with it. It is something that is happening in every moment of everybody's life. Remember It: you are always crucifying your Jesus in favor of your mind. Stop that crucifixion. If you understand me rightly, what I am saying to you, you will stop that crucifixion.\nI have heard a story: An incompetent carpenter once built a creaky house for himself, and maintained it carelessly. The roof threatened to collapse, the floors were rough to walk upon. His neighbors warned him of the dangers and the unattractiveness of his house, but he angrily refused to listen because it was not only a house, it was also his ego-trip. It was his house, and he had made it.\nWhenever anybody said anything against the house, he took it as if that man was against him.\nThis is how mind reacts.\nFinally getting tired of unwanted advice, he placed plugs in his ears. The warnings continued, but now the carpenter only smiled, not hearing a word.\nInevitably, one day his house collapsed. Fortunately the man escaped with only minor injuries. His neighbors scolded. They said,'See? We warned you. You are punished by your own stubbornness.' The carpenter just smiled pleasantly; he still wore his ear-plugs. Incredibly, in spite of the disaster, the carpenter went right back to the same foolishness.\nEgo is very stubborn. Even if you feel that you have committed a mistake, you don't realize it. You try to rationalize in a thousand and one ways, to defend, to prove that it is not a mistake. And you again do it, hoping that this time everything is going to be okay. This is hoping against hope.\nIncredibly, in spite of the disaster, the carpenter went right back to the same foolishness -- he built and lived in another hazardous house. He was again warned, but never changed his perilous way. That was because he had, by this time, taken his ear-plugs as both a normal and an easy way of life.\nThis explains the tragic life of men and women who insist on wearing psychological ear-plugs. And remember, not only are Jews obsessed with psychological ear-plugs, everybody on this earth is. Whenever your ego is in danger, you stop listening. Or, you start listening to something which is not said at all. Or, you start interpreting in favor of your own ego. Anybody who is in search of truth has to understand these tricks, because these tricks are the traps.\nThese tricks are the ways in which you will miss the path. The path is very straight and clear, but your mind is very cunning and it goes on creating new, illusory paths; and you go on listening to it. And you have listened to it always and always, and always it has proved to be in the wrong But it is your mind. You think it is you; it is your ego. Just see the point of it.\nJesus' message was very simple in a way, straight. Anybody could have understood it, but nobody understood it. And people became so enraged that they killed this simple and innocent man. He had not committed any sin. He was not a criminal, but he was treated as a criminal; not only like a criminal, he was treated, worse than that. This is the point of today's sutras.\nThree persons were going to be killed on that day: two thieves and Jesus. One of the thieves' name was Barabbas. Pontius Pilate was hoping -- because that was the tradition, the convention, that the Governor General would be allowed to forgive one person each year -- he was hoping that the Jews would ask that Jesus be forgiven, released, and should not be killed. But the Jews asked that Jesus be killed and Barabbas, a criminal, be released. They treated Jesus even worse than a criminal.\nWhat was his crime? -- the criminal had broken only one law, or at the most two laws; Jesus was breaking all the laws. He was not a criminal. In fact, he had not done anything wrong, but he was dangerous. The criminal was not dangerous; at the most he was a thief, or at the most he may have been a murderer -- but the whole society was not at stake, the whole society was not in danger. He may have been a law-breaker, but he was not against law. Even people who are criminals are for law; they feel guilty, and they know that they have done wrong.\nThis man Jesus was dangerous. He had not done anything wrong, but he was against all law.\nHe is for love, and against law.\nA thousand and one criminals are less than this man's danger. All the criminals together are less than the danger this man brings, because he is destroying the very foundation of your society. Maybe your society is nothing but a madhouse, but you think that it is your society. And this man is destroying the very foundations.\nThey asked that a criminal should be forgiven, but Jesus had to be crucified. He was the greatest criminal, and he had not committed a crime at all! But he was bringing a revolution in the thinking of people, he was bringing a revolution in their minds. The greatest revolution there is, is the revolution for love and against law; because law creates the rigidity of life, and love gives it again a melting. Law makes your life frozen, love melts it through its warmth. Law is ugly. Jesus was not saying,'Be unlawful.' That is where the misunderstanding lay: he was against law, but he was not for lawlessness. He was against law and for love. He was against law, but he was not saying to become lawless. He was saying,'Rise above law, go beyond it; reach to the heights of love.' Then there is no need for law -- your love will take care. Love is enough, the law is not needed.\nI have overheard two small children walking on the road. The elder one was saying,'This is Sunday, and we should not work.' They must have been Christian.\nThe younger one said,'Look at the policeman. He is working, he is on duty. And the priest says that those who work on Sunday will not go to heaven. What about policemen?' The elder one said,'Policemen are not needed there.'\nWhen love exists, law is not needed. Law is a poor substitute for love. Jesus was giving a higher law, and he was misunderstood. People thought he was destroying their law, their society, their structure, but he was giving a more fluid structure.\nI go on saying that I am against all character: you can misunderstand me. You can think that I am teaching characterlessness. No, I am simply teaching a higher character -- a character which is not rigid, a character which is not fixed, a character which is not dead; a character which is alive like a river, a character which flows; a character which knows no boundaries, a character which can respond spontaneously; a character which is not a clinging to the past but is always a response in the present. The greatest men of character are always characterless. Buddha and Jesus, they are lawless, characterless, unsocial,\nbecause they bring a higher law into the world. But your eyes cannot rise that high, and you cannot see what they bring. They bring sky to us, and we have become so accustomed to creeping on the earth in our small holes that we cannot see the freedom that they bring their freedom seems risky.\nIt happened once: There were five fools travelling together. They were tired.\nThey sat down against a tree, and all of them stretched out their legs. They said,'What are we going to do now? We won't be able to get up anymore. We are no longer able to tell which of those feet belong to who.' They were really in deep trouble -- 'What are we going to do now?' They started crying and weeping:'We will just have to stay here forever and ever. We are stuck. Now nobody knows which legs belong to whom.' There they were, crying and weeping, getting hungry and thirsty, and they couldn't get up.\nA man passed by, and he said,'What are you doing in there? Why are you crying and weeping? What has happened to you, what unfortunate accident has happened to you?'\n'Well, here we are,' said the fools,'we can't get up.'\n'But why can't you get up? I can't see any problem,' said the man.'You look perfectly healthy.'\n'Because we don't know which feet belong to which.'\n'For goodness sakes! How much will you give me if I tell you?'\n'Well, said the fools,'we will give you something, as long as you tell us which of those feet belong to which.'\nHe took a big bag-needle and began to stick them with it. He stuck one of them:'Ouch!'\n'That's yours -- pull it in!'\nHe stuck another one:'Ouch!'\n'That is yours, that one -- pull it in!'\nHe stuck all of them the same way until he had the very last one on his feet.\nThat is the situation of humanity. The whole of humanity has been behaving very foolishly. Somebody is needed to hit you hard, to make you aware. And whenever somebody comes and hits you out of his compassion, you get angry, you misunderstand him.\nJesus was hammering people on their heads to bring a certain truth home: that nobody is imprisoning you except yourselves, that nobody has made this mess of your life except yourself, that nobody has prepared this trap for you -- it is you yourself. This ugly state of affairs, this miserable state of affairs, is your own doing: that's the whole message. But whenever somebody says,'This is your doing,' you want to retaliate. You would like him to say that somebody else is responsible; that saves your face. Whenever somebody says to you that only you are responsible, you retaliate, react you become angry. You? -- how can you be responsible? You are so wise. And to think oneself wise is the definition of being a foolish man.\nNow, the sutras:\nTHEN RELEASED HE BARABBAS UNTO THEM, BECAUSE THEY HAD\nASKED FOR HIM. AND WHEN HE HAD SCOURGED JESUS, HE DELIVERED\nHIM TO BE CRUCIFIED.\nAND ABOUT THE NINTH HOUR JESUS CRIED OUT WITH A LOUD VOICE, SAYING: ELI, ELI, LAMASABACHTHANI? THAT IS TO SAY: MY GOD, MY\nGOD, WHY HAST THOU FORSAKEN ME?\nThis sentence has tremendous import and has to be understood very deeply and carefully. Whether you will be able to understand Jesus or not, much depends on your understanding of this sentence. There are many interpretations.\nA few think that Jesus became doubtful. They think, a few interpreters think, that he was also hoping for a miracle: that God would descend from heaven and save him, and there would be a great miracle. And that miracle did not happen, and he\nwas just on the verge of being crucified. He was put on the cross, and he cried,'Eli, Eli! -- My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?' -- What wrong have I done that you have forsaken me? Why have you left me alone? Why are you not doing something to save me? Where is your promise, where is your miracle?\nNo, this interpretation is wrong. Jesus is not saying anything like that. He was not doubtful, and he was not expecting any miracle. Others were expecting, right; the crowd was expecting right; but Jesus was not expecting any miracle.\nBecause a man like Jesus knows that just to be, is the greatest miracle; there is no greater miracle possible. Just to be is enough, more than enough. You cannot ask for more. Just to be alive amidst so much death, to be alive in the ocean of death is the greatest miracle. In so much darkness, dense darkness, to be conscious and alive is all. What more can you ask for? No, he was not waiting for any miracle.\nThen why did he say,'Why hast thou forsaken me?' This happens to everybody who comes to the last step to one who comes to the very verge of samadhi, the very verge of enlightenment. This happens to everybody. It is as if a river is just going to flow into the ocean -- the known is going to meet the unknown, life is going to embrace death. It is natural, it is absolutely natural. It is not a doubt, it is not anything like scepticism, it is not losing trust. No, it is simply human that before one dissolves, one has a shivering, a fear. One is being uprooted, uprooted from life.\nIt is the same fear that a child feels when he is going to be born. When the child is going to just come out of the womb, EVERY child I tell you, says,'Eli, Eli -- my God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?' He had a different life up to then.\nNow, that whole life is being uprooted, and one never knows where one is going.\nOne faces eternal abyss, one faces a bottomless abyss. One starts trembling. That is the humanity of Jesus.\nIn Jesus' cry,'Eli, Eli,' the whole of humanity cried that day. That's what is beautiful in Jesus. Buddha would not do that; he would not cry. It is as if he had no human part in him -- all stone, marble. Jesus is a man of flesh and bone, just like you and me; a fragile being facing eternal abyss. It is not because of any doubt that he cried -- because if there had been doubt he would not have\nsaid,'Eli, Eli! -- My God, my God!' He would not have said that. If there had been doubt, he would have said the thing that Nietsche said after twenty centuries:'God is dead. There is no God.'\nIf he had been waiting for any miracle, that would have been the moment to say,'You don't exist, and I was befooled by my own illusions, my own dreams.' If Jesus had been sceptical, he would have said,'There is no God anymore. I was wrong to believe in you; you don't exist.' Or, he would have challenged,'This is the point to prove whether you are or not. NOW do the miracle and prove that you are!'\nIt happened to one philosopher, Edmund Burke: he went to church when there was a congregation. He stood just before the congregation, took out his pocket watch and said,'I will believe in God if He can stop this watch, just now.' He looked upwards, and said,'If you are, if you exist, please do at least this much of a miracle. This is not a big miracle I am asking for. Stop this watch.' And the watch did not stop. It is proved that God doesn't exist. Edmund Burke was not asking for a big miracle, but a small miracle; very small, nothing much. But the question is not whether you ask for a big miracle or a small miracle; the question is: are you asking for a proof? Then the proof cannot be supplied, because the existence is not at all concerned to prove itself to anybody. In fact, those who try to prove that they are, are in a certain way suspicious of their being. God is not suspicious, so whatsoever you say, He goes on quietly, silently smiling. He does not bother. He is, and what is the need to prove it?\nJesus was not asking for proof, otherwise he would not have said,'My God, my God' -- God remains still 'my' -- 'why hast thou forsaken me?' This is simple humanity, fragile humanness. Left alone, it comes to everybody; this crucifixion comes to everybody. If you go deeper in meditation, one day you will find the meaning of this sentence,'Eli, Eli, lamasabachthani.' One day you will find, moving slowly, slowly, slowly, that you come to the point where you are dissolving, disappearing. This is the point of crucifixion, and you will also cry,'My God, why have you forsaken me? I am disappearing, evaporating!' It is simply an indication of fragile humanness, nothing else. And it shows the authenticity of the experience because it happens only when one really faces that moment of total cessation, crucifixion, where the ego completely disappears. One is left in total emptiness. There is no doubt in it, there is no asking for any miracle. It is not a question, it is a statement about Jesus' humanity:'I am a fragile human being, son of man, and I am afraid. I am trembling, and I would like to go\nback.'\nBut there is no going back, because that is the point of no return. So, except for crying, what else can you do?'My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?'\nSOME OF THEM THAT STOOD THERE, WHEN THEY HEARD THAT SAID: THIS MAN CALLETH F OR ELIAS.\nThat's what I mean: whenever you hear a man like Jesus, you interpret him in your own way. Elias is an old prophet. The people interpreted that he was calling for Elias. He was calling for the living God, who is now, and people thought he was calling for Elias who was sometime in the past. The mind thinks of the past, a no-mind responds to the present.\nJesus was calling for God who is right now, and who is always now; who has, no past and no future, who is just present. He was, calling to God, the present, the living, just now facing him. But people thought he was calling to Elias, the old prophet.\nSOME OF THEM THAT STOOD THERE, WHEN THEY HEARD THAT SAID: THIS MAN CALLETH FOR ELIAS.\nAND STRAIGHTWAY ONE OF THEM RAN AND TOOK A SPONGE AND\nFILLED IT WITH VINEGAR AND PUT IT ON A REED, AND GAVE HIM TO\nDRINK.\nTHE REST SAID: LET BE. LET'S SEE WHETHER ELIAS WILL COME TO SAVE\nHIM.\nJESUS, WHEN HE HAD CRIED AGAIN WITH A LOUD VOICE, YIELDED UP\nTHE GHOST.\nOnce more he cried,'My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?' Why twice?\nFirst he cried; he must have hoped that there would be an answer, that there would be a response. Nothing happened.\nExistence is silent. You hear only your echoes.\nThere was no answer coming from existence. He cried once more -- maybe he had not been heard? -- existence never answers. Not that it doesn't answer; it never answers verbally, it never answers your mind. It answers, in an existential way. It answered, but Jesus could not follow at that moment -- at that moment, nobody is able to follow. At that moment one simply trembles and sees earth slipping away underneath, and sees oneself evaporating. And there is no answer coming.\nOnly later on, when Jesus was resurrected, could he then understand the answer.\nThe answer is given in terms of existence, not in terms of intellect, mind. It is not verbal. The answer is resurrection. Die totally, and then you resurrect. And that was the answer:'I have not forsaken you. I am always there deep within you; how can I forsake you? -- because I am you. How can I forsake you? How can I go away from you? -- because I am your innermost core. That which has died on the cross is neither you nor I. It is just a vehicle, a house, a dream you were using.\nIt is neither you nor I.' And these people who had crucified Jesus, they had crucified only the body, not the spirit. The spirit cannot be crucified. It is immortal. But that answer will come a little later on, when Jesus has died. He cried again:\nJESUS, WHEN HE HAD CRIED AGAIN WITH A LOUD VOICE, YIELDED UP\nTHE GHOST.\nOnce more he tried to find out the answer, any response from the whole, from the ocean. No response coming, he died, he disappeared.\nThis is what Buddha calls NIRVANA, the cessation of the flame. He surrendered.\nThat is the meaning of 'he yielded up the ghost' -- he surrendered. He said,'Yes,\nthy will be done. Let it be so, as you will.'\nAND BEHOLD, THE VEIL OF THE TEMPLE WAS RENT IN TWAIN FROM THE TOP TO THE BOTTOM, AND THE EARTH DID QUAKE, AND THE ROCKS RENT;\nA man like Jesus is the very pinnacle of consciousness, a cherished flower. He is someone who has been coming up, coming up for centuries after so many births, growing, growing. And then comes the flowering. The whole existence celebrates, the whole existence feels the glory of God. And when such a man drops dead, leaves the body, a sadness spreads all over existence. It has to be so...\nbecause we are not separate from each other; we are interlinked, we are joined together. We are one mass of consciousness. Individuality is just an egoistic notion. So whenever a Jesus flowers, the whole existence feels the blessing; and whenever a Jesus drops his body, the whole existence feels the sadness. These are the symbolic ways of saying this:'And behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom, and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent.' It has to be so.\nIt is said about Mohammed that whenever he would walk in the desert, a cloud would follow him to give him shelter, like an umbrella. It may not be historical, but it is significant. It is poetic, symbolic -- it SAYS something.\nIt is said about Buddha that when he became enlightened, trees flowered out of season. They may not have flowered; this may not be a scientific statement. But a statement need not be scientific to be true, a statement need not be historical to be true. There are planes and planes of truth. There is a certain quality in a poetic truth also. It is not historic, it is not scientific, but it is true all the same. It is a POETIC truth. And a poetic truth is on a higher plane than any scientific truth, because scientific truths go on changing; a poetic truth is eternal. Scientific truth is more or less a fact. A poetic truth is not a fact but a deep significance, a meaning, a myth.\nIt is said about Mahavir that when he would walk and move from one village to another -- and he was nude, a naked man with no shoes, no clothes -- sometimes thorns would be on the path: they would immediately turn to protect his feet.\nThorns may not have done this -- one cannot expect that much from thorns. Even from human beings it is too much to expect. But still, the idea is significant. It simply shows one thing: that we are members of each other. Thorns are also part of us, and we are part of thorns. Flowers are also part of us, and we are part of flowers. We are one family. We are not strangers, separate islands: a vast continent of being, interrelated.\nThe earth may not have quaked, but I say that the gospel is true. And whenever there is any contradiction between a poetic truth and a scientific truth, always believe the poetic. The scientific is very ordinary. To believe in the poetic truth is extraordinary. It gives you vision, it raises you to a higher plane of being. Just to trust a poetic truth, you start flying, as if suddenly wings have grown to you.\nYou are no longer moving on the earth, you fly in the sky. When a truth has wings, it becomes poetic.\nAND, BEHOLD, THE VEIL OF THE TEMPLE WAS RENT IN TWAIN FROM\nTHE TOP TO THE BOTTOM, AND THE EARTH DID QUAKE, AND THE ROCKS RENT;\nAND THE GRAVES WERE OPENED, AND MANY BODIES OF THE SAINTS\nWHICH SLEPT AROSE.\nOf course, it should be so. Even if it had not been so, it should have been so.\nWhenever a Jesus is crucified, all the saints of the past must feel it in their graves; they have to feel it.\nIn fact, Buddha has said that whenever a Buddha is born, not only do the past Buddhas feel it, but even the future Buddhas feel it, those who are going to be.\nBecause time is a human concept, but in fact there is no time. It is eternal. It is one whole, one piece.\nAND THE GRAVES WERE OPENED, AND MANY BODIES OF THE\nSAINTS\nWHICH SLEPT AROSE.\nJesus being crucified was such a shock. It was such a shock, such a sword-like, sharp penetration into the being. It was not only Jesus crucified, it was all religion crucified that day, all saints crucified in Jesus.\nWhat is the meaning of it? The meaning is that the present contains the whole past, this moment contains the whole past. Nothing disappears, nothing CAN\ndisappear. Where will it go? This rose flower contains all the rose flowers of the past; and if you can understand, let me say, it contains all the future flowers also.\nThis is just one flower representing all the flowers of the past and future. We are here; in this moment the whole existence converges. All the past and all the future converges in this moment. This moment is the bridge between the past and the future. In you, everything is meeting right now. If you can become aware, then you are the whole existence this very moment. This is the meaning of the Upanishadic saying: AHAM BRAHMASMI -- 'I am the whole.' This is the meaning of Jesus, repeating again and again,'I and my Father are one' -- I am the whole. This is the meaning of el-Hillaj Mansur who said, ANA-EL-HAQQ -- 'I am the truth.'\nIn each moment the whole converges. Each moment represents the whole, the whole past and the whole future. Jesus is not only Jesus: all the Buddhas are involved, all the saints are involved; and not only of the past but, I say to you, of the future also.\nAND THE GRAVES WERE OPENED, AND MANY BODIES OF THE SAINTS\nWHICH SLEPT AROSE,\nAND CAME OUT OF THE GRAVES AFTER HIS RESURRECTION, AND. WENT INTO THE HOLY CITY AND APPEARED UNTO MANY.\nAnd this was felt by many. It was not just written by the few disciples. Even others who had the sensitivity felt it.\nIt depends on your sensitivity.\nWhat I am saying to you this moment, if you are really sensitive, you can feel all\n-\n- the whole past and the whole future converging in you. And in that moment you are no more a tiny being, you are the whole. Those who were sensitive, they could see it. They could feel unknown forces moving around.\nThat day of Jesus' crucifixion was not an ordinary day. People who had a little prayer in them must have felt certain unknown forces moving. People who had a little meditation in them must have felt, must have become perceptive. Those who had loved, or those who had a poetic vision, or the sense of an artist, they must have felt. People who had any quality of the heart must have felt many presences all around.\nThe Gospel writers were not aware of Indian scriptures, otherwise they would have made it more clear. In India we have a very long tradition, and we have tried through many dimensions to interpret the unknown. When Buddha spoke, it is said that not only human beings were present there to listen to him; gods also came, animals also, trees also listened. If you read Buddhist scriptures you will be surprised, because the number of listeners was so great. You must be surprised, because no instruments existed -- how could Buddha have spoken to such great multitudes? -- the microphone was not there, there was no way to communicate. But there is a misunderstanding. Those numbers are not only of human beings. The greater part of them were DEVAS, gods who had come from above to listen to Buddha; then animals who could not understand language, but who could feel; then trees and plants and birds; who didn't need any verbal communication, just the very presence of Buddha was enough nourishment to them; and THEN human beings.\nHuman beings were a very minor part of the whole audience. And the same is the story about Mahavir, and about other Teerthankaras and other Buddhas.\nAbout Mahavir, it is said that when first he spoke, only gods could understand and listen to him because he spoke on such a high plane that it was impossible for anybody else to understand. Then gods persuaded him,'Please come a little lower to help humanity.' Then, by and by, he spoke on a lower plane and humanity could understand. Then gods persuaded him to come still a little lower,\nbecause animals were there, and the trees and the rocks.\nThese stories are beautiful. They say only one thing: that we all are interrelated, we are not separate. The highest point is related to the lowest. We are all rungs of one ladder -- the lowest is as much a part of the same ladder as the highest.\nThose who were sensitive must have felt unknown, strange presences all around.\nBut the whole thing depends on your sensitivity; nothing else is needed. A great intellectual attainment is not needed, a great logical acumen is not needed. When Jesus comes to you and knocks at your door, all that is needed is deep sensitivity.\nLet me tell you a very small anecdote: A good and thoughtful king offered a ride in his carriage to a weary traveller on the road. Having been treated badly by evil kings, the traveller hesitantly asked,'Sir, what must I give in return?'\nThe understanding king replied,'Just one thing: your acceptance of the offer.' Yes, that's all that a Jesus asks of you -- your acceptance of the offer.\nCome Follow To You, Vol 4 Chapter #10 Chapter title: I am the See You are Seeking 30 December 1975 am in Buddha Hall The first question:\nQuestion 1\nYOU APPEAR TO DEVOTE YOUR LIFE TO HELPING OTHER PEOPLE; BUT\nPEOPLE AROUND YOU APPEAR ONLY INTERESTED IN HELPING\nTHEMSELVES. IF THEIR AIM IS TO LOSE THEIR EGOS, IS NOT A BETTER\nMETHOD TO LOSE ONESELF IN HELPING OTHERS?\nTHIS is from a new seeker, Virginia. Because she is new, she cannot understand what is happening here.\nThe first thing to remember: you can help others only when you have helped yourself, not before it. You can help others only when you have disappeared, not before it. You cannot lose your ego by helping others. You can lose your ego, and THEN YOU can help others. In fact, if you have the ego already there and you help others, you will attain to a very cultivated, subtle, pious ego -- that's all.\nEgolessness won't come through it. The ego will become religious,'and when a poison becomes religious, it becomes more dangerous.\nI am helping you because I am not. You are here to help yourself in the first place. When you disappear, then in |fact there is no need to help others; it happens of its own accord.\nLet me tell you an anecdote: A woman always attended church, and after each sermon would remark,'My, they certainly did need the message this morning.'\nOne snowy Sunday morning, she was the only one in the congregation. The minister delivered his message anyway. He walked with her to the door, where she said,'My, they certainly would have needed it if they had been here.' The message is for you. Don't play tricks with yourself; don't start a new ego-trip. It is not for them, it is for you. I am talking to each individual directly; I am not talking to a crowd. When I say something, I am saying it exactly to you, not to the neighbors.\nAnd the only way you can be of any help to the world is that you disappear, become an emptiness. Out of that emptiness arises the flame of love and compassion. Out of that emptiness arises a fragrance of divineness. And then you help millions, but you never come to know that you are helping them. You become a vehicle of God, you become an incarnation. Before that you can become a missionary, which is a dirty word. Before that you can become a do- gooder, which is very dangerous. Before that you can become a very pious egoist: helping others one Feels oneself on top of them.'Holier than thou' becomes your attitude. In your very look there is condemnation and you cannot help anybody through condemnation, only through compassion.\nBut how is compassion possible with the ego? With the ego, violence is possible, condemnation is possible. Love and compassion? no, they are not possible. So\nplease be alert. It always happens when you come near a Master and you hear the message, that your mind starts spinning things. It says,'THEY need it.' The whole world needs it except you. Be aware: YOU need it. You are they.\nThe world is not separate from you, the world is you multiplied.\nAnd let me say to you that I teach selfishness. I don't teach that you should go and serve others. I teach: love yourself, serve yourself, so that that which is hidden within you becomes manifest. The very flow of it will help others.\nWherever you walk, whatsoever you do, will become a help. It is not that you are trying to help; your very being will become helpful.\nThe second question:\nQuestion 2\nHAVING ATTAINED THE PEACEFUL STATE OF MIND WHICH YOU CALL\nINDIA, HOW CAN ONE SUSTAIN IT IN THE PRESSURES OF THE WEST? FOR ME, IT HAS BEEN IMPOSSIBLE.\nYes, I call India not a country, but an inner space. I call India not something that exists there in geography, on the maps. I call India that which exists hidden within you, and that which you have not yet discovered. India is your innermost space. India is not a nation, it is a state of mind.\nThe questioner asks,'Having attained the peaceful state of mind which you call India, how can one sustain it in the pressures of the West? For me, it has been impossible.'\nOnce you attain it, you cannot lose it. Even if you want to lose it, you cannot lose it. No real attainment is ever lost. Then, you must have imagined that you had attained to the innermost peace. Then, you must have deceived yourself. Then, something must have given you the idea that you had attained to it.\nFor example, if you go to the Himalayas, it is peaceful and silent. Eternal silence reigns there. In that silence you start feeling silent you reflect silence. Don't\nthink that you have become silent; it is the Himalayas being reflected in you. The silence belongs to the Himalayas, not to you. When you come down to the plains, that silence is gone. Again you are in the turmoil, again you ARE the turmoil, again the anguish and the anxiety. And you think you have lost something which you had gained? No, in the first place you had never gained it. It belonged to the Himalayas; it still belongs there. You entered a certain situation, but you didn't enter a certain state. The situation is something outside you, the state is something within you. And you deceived yourself. It is so easy to deceive oneself. One wants to feel that one has attained, because that also gives a very deep nourishment to the ego: I have attained.\nMany people come to India. Coming from the West, India looks silent, peaceful, poor but contented. India is, in a way, almost two thousand years behind. When you come from New York to India, or from London to the Himalayas, you are moving backwards in time. You are moving in the times of Jesus, two thousand years back. Everything is primitive, wild, untamed. One feels good; one feels again a certain freedom. The noise, the anxiety, the tension, the constant hurry, the 'always going somewhere not knowing where one is going' of the West, is not here. Things move slowly. Everything seems to be moving nowhere, very silently. A certain music is still present. Indians may not feel it because they have been born to it, just as a fish never feels the ocean. But when people from the West come, they are shocked into a certain awareness. Their sleep is broken, and they start feeling and thinking that they have attained to a certain state. To attain a certain state is not so easy. It is not a plane trip: you cannot fly from one state of mind to another state of mind. It is not a journey, it is a pilgrimage.\nAnd this is the distinction between a journey and a pilgrimage: a journey is going from one point to another point in space, a pilgrimage is going from without to within, from space to no-space. You can be easily deceived here, not by anybody else, but by yourself.\nThen you go back, and that freedom, that silence, that meditation, that prayerfulness, is lost. Hence the question:'Having attained the peaceful state of mind which you call India, how can one sustain it?' There is no need to sustain it.\nIt is so alive, it is so vital that it sustains itself. It has tremendous energy. It needs nobody's help. In fact, you are not needed to sustain it; it sustains you. It is greater than you, higher than you, deeper than you, bigger than you: it is your original nature. It is you in your ultimate glory. Nothing is needed to sustain it,\nand nothing can distract you from it. Once attained, it is attained forever. You cannot lose it. If you lose it, then know well that you deceived yourself.\n'How can one sustain it in the pressures of the West?' If it cannot be sustained in the pressures, it is not of worth. Any meditation that is of worth will be alive even in the marketplace. Because a marketplace is nothing once you attain to the meditative state. No market can disturb it, no market can distract you away from it. It becomes like breathing. In fact, you will feel it more in the marketplace than in the Himalayas, because in the Himalayas the contrast will be missing. If you have really tasted what aloneness is, you will feel it more in the crowd than on a Himalayan peak, because in the crowd, the contrast.… If you have listened to the inner music, you will hear it more in traffic noise because of the contrast. In the night you can see the stars in the sky, not in the day -- because the contrast is missing. The night is so dark; in that velvety darkness you can see those stars, beautiful stars In the day they did appear. They are still there where they are, they have not gone anywhere, they remain in the sky -- but the contrast is missing because of the sunlight. Now there is no background to them.\nThis, is my understanding, this is my experience: that whatsoever you attain, you will always taste it more, feel it more; it will surface in your being more clearly, crystal clear, whenever you move to the contrary. If the meditation is true, in New York it will be more clear to you, in London you will feel it more.\nSurrounding yourself with the opposite, it will throb more clearly. If it is not happening, you come to the East, you feel good, and then you go to the West and it is gone. It has been a journey, not a pilgrimage. You travelled from one point to another in space, you have not travelled from space to no-space. Meditation means a pilgrimage from the out to the in, from the without to the within. Once attained, even if you want to lose it you cannot lose it.\nThe third question:\nQuestion 3\nWHEN I AM WRITING A BOOK, I AM FULL OF FLOWING ENERGY AND DELIGHT. BUT, WHEN I HAVE FINISHED, I AM SO EMPTY AND DEAD THAT I CAN HARDLY BEAR TO LIVE. NOW I AM MUST STARTING TO\nWRITE, BUT THOUGH I CAN GET INTO THE PLEASURE WHILE I AM WORKING, DURING THE MEDITATIONS I GET OVERWHELMED WITH FEAR OF THE EMPTINESS WHICH I EXPECT MONTHS FROM NOW.\nThis is from Pankaja; she is a novelist. I have gone through her novels, and they are beautiful. She has the knack of it: how to tell a story beautifully, how to weave a story. And this experience is not only hers, it is of almost everybody who is in any way creative. But still, the interpretation is wrong, and much depends on the interpretation.\nWhen a woman carries a child, she is full. Of course, when the child is born, she will feel empty. She will miss the new life that was throbbing and kicking in her womb. The child has gone out; she will feel empty for a few days. But she can love the child, and she can forget her emptiness in loving the child and helping the child to grow. For an artist, even that is not possible. You paint, or you write a poem or a novel; once it is finished you feel deep emptiness. And what can you do with the book now? So the artist is in an even more difficult situation than a mother. Once a book is finished, it is finished. Now it needs no help, no love; it is not going to grow. It is perfect, it is born grown-up. A painting is finished, it is finished. an artist feels very empty. But, one has to look into this emptiness.\nDon't say that you are exhausted; rather, say that you are spent. Don't say that you are empty, because each emptiness also has a fullness in it. You are looking from the wrong end.\nYou come into a room: there is furniture, pictures on the walls and things. Then those things and the pictures are removed and you come into the room: now what will you say? Will you call it empty, or will you call it a full room?'Room'\nmeans emptiness;'room' means space. With the furniture removed, the room is full. When furniture was there the room was not full; much of it was missing because of the furniture. Now the room is complete, the emptiness is total.\nYou can look from two ends. If you are too furniture-oriented, so that you can only look at the chairs and tables and the sofa and you cannot see the roominess of the room, then it will feel empty. But if you know, and you can see emptiness directly, you will feel a tremendous freedom which was not there before because the room was missing; you could not move in it. Go on filling it with furniture,\nand there will come a point when you cannot move because the whole room is gone.\nOnce I stayed in a very rich man's house. He was very rich, but had no taste. His house was so full that it was not a house at all. You could not move, and you were always afraid to move because he had precious antiques. He himself was afraid to move. The servants were constantly worried. He gave me the best, the most beautiful room in his house. And I told him,'This is not a room, it is a museum. Please give me something where I can move, then it will be a room.\nThis is not a room. The room has almost disappeared.' The room means: the freedom that space gives you.\nWhen you are working, creating, your mind is full of many things. The mind is occupied. Writing a novel the mind is occupied; writing a poem the mind is occupied; there is too much furniture in it -- the furniture of the mind: thoughts, feelings, characters. Then the book is finished. Suddenly, the furniture is gone.\nYou feel empty. But there is no need to become sad. If you look at it rightly -- this is what Buddha called right-vision, SAMYAK DRASTHI -- if you look rightly, you will feel freed of an obsession, of an occupation. You will feel clean again, unburdened. Those characters of the novel are no longer moving there. Those guests are gone and the host is totally at ease. Enjoy it. Your wrong interpretation is creating sadness for you, and fear. Enjoy it. Have you never observed that when a guest comes you feel good; when he goes you feel even better? He leaves you alone, and now you have your own space.\nTo write a novel is maddening because so many characters become guests, and each character has his own way. It is not always that he listens to the writer, not always. Sometimes he has his own way, and he forces the writer in a certain direction. The writer starts the novel, but never ends it. Then those characters end it by themselves.\nIt is just like giving birth to a child. You can give birth to a child, but then the child starts moving on his own. The mother may have been thinking that the child would become a doctor, and he becomes a hobo. What can you do? You try-hard, but he becomes a hobo.\nThe same happens when you write a novel: you start with \u0026 character -- you were going to make a saint out of him, and he becomes a sinner. And I tell you,\nit is exactly as it happens to a child: the mother is worried; the novelist is worried.\nHe wanted him to become a saint and he is becoming a sinner, and nothing can be done. He feels almost helpless, almost used by these characters. They are his fantasies, but once you cooperate with them they become almost real. And unless you get rid of them, you will never be at peace. If you have a book in your mind, it has to be written to get rid of it. It is a catharsis, it is unburdening yourself.\nThat's why creative people almost always go mad. Mediocrities never go mad -- they have nothing to go mad over, they have nothing maddening in their lives.\nCreators almost always go mad. A Van Gogh will go mad, a Nijinsky will go mad, a Nietsche will go mad. Why does it happen that they go mad? -- because they are so occupied; so many things are happening in the mind. They don't have a space of their own within themselves. So many people are staying there, coming and going. It is almost as if they are sitting on a road and the traffic continues. Each artist has to pay for it.\nRemember, when a book is finished and a child is born, feel happy, enjoy that space, because sooner or later a new book will arise. As leaves come out of trees, as flowers come out of trees -- exactly like that, poems come out of a poet, novels come out of a novelist, paintings come out of a painter, songs are born out of a singer. Nothing can be done; they are natural.\nSo sometimes in the fall when the leaves have fallen and the tree stands alone without leaves against the sky, enjoy it. Don't call it emptiness, call it a new type of fullness -- full with yourself. There is nobody to interfere; you are resting in yourself. That period of rest is needed for every artist; it is a natural process.\nEach mother's body needs a little rest. One child is born and another is conceived it used to happen, it used to happen in the East, and in India it still continues: a woman is almost old by the age of thirty, continuously giving birth to children with no gap to recuperate, to rejuvenate her being, to be alone. She is exhausted, tired. Her youth, her freshness, her beauty, are gone. A rest period is needed when you give birth to a child. You need a rest period. And if the child is going to be a lion, then a long rest period is needed. And a lion only gives birth to one child, because the whole being is involved in it. And then there is a rest period, a\nlong rest period to recupe, to regain the energy that you have given to the child, to regain yourself again so that something can be born out of you.\nWhen you write a novel, if it has been really a great piece of art, then you will feel empty. If it has been just a sort of journalism that you have made for money because some publisher has made a contract with you, then, then it is not very deep. You will not feel empty after it, you will remain the same. The deeper your creation, the greater will be your emptiness afterwards, The greater the storm, the greater will be the silence that comes in its wake. Enjoy it. The storm is good, enjoy it; and the silence that follows it is also good. The day is beautiful, full of activity; night is also very beautiful, full of inactivity, passivity, emptiness. One sleeps. In the morning you are again back in the world with full energy to work, to act.\nDon't be afraid of the night. Many people are. There is one sannyasin, I have given her the name Nisha.'Nisha' means: the night. She comes to me again and again, and she says,'Please change my name.''Why?' She says,'I am afraid of night. Why have you given me, out of so many names, just this name? Change it.'\nBut I am not going to change it. I have given it to her knowingly, because of her fear -- her fear of darkness, her fear of passivity, her fear of relaxation, her fear of surrender. That is all indicated in the word'night', nisha.\nOne has to accept the night part also. Only then do you become complete, full, whole.\nSo Pankaja, don't take it amiss. That emptiness is beautiful, more beautiful than the days of creativity, because that creativity comes out of emptiness, those flowers come out of emptiness. enjoy that emptiness, feel blissful and blessed.\nAccept it, welcome it like a benediction, and soon you will see that you are again full of activity, and a greater book is going to be born again. Don't be worried about it. There is no need to worry. It is just a misinterpretation of a beautiful phenomenon.\nBut man lives in words. Once you call a thing by a wrong name, you start becoming afraid of it. Be very, very exact. Always remember what you say, because saying is not just saying; it has deep associations in your being. Once you call a thing emptiness, you become afraid -- the very word.\nIn India, we have better words for emptiness. We call it SHUNYA. The very word is positive; it has nothing of negativity in it. It is beautiful. It simply means space, with no boundaries: SHUNYA. And we have called the ultimate goal shunya. Buddha says when you become shunya, when you become absolutely nothing, a nothingness, then you have attained.\nA poet, an artist, a painter, is on the way to becoming a mystic. All artistic activity is on the way towards becoming religious. When you are active, writing a poem, you are in the mind. When the poem is born you are spent, and the mind takes rest. Use these moments to fall into your being. Don't call it emptiness; call it wholeness, call it being, call it truth, call it God. And then you will be able to feel the benediction of it.\nThe fourth question:\nQuestion 4\nI WANT TO COME CLOSE TO YOU, OSHO, BUT I ENJOY BEING IN OPEN\nSPACES AND BY THE SEA. SO WHAT TO DO?\nI don't see the problem. Can you find a more open space than me? And can you find a more wild sea than me?\nI am absolute lawlessness.\nThere is no problem. Don't try to create a problem where none exists. Just look into my eyes: I am the sea you are seeking, and I am the vast empty space you have always been searching for through many of your Lives. Now by chance, just coincidentally you are close to me. Don't miss this opportunity. There are many ways to miss it, there is only one way not to miss it. There are a thousand and one ways to go away from me, there is only one way to come near me. So it is almost impossible that you will be able to come near me, because the possibility to go astray is more -- one thousand and one. You can find so many reasons to go away from me, and you can justify them, you can rationalize and you can feel perfectly right in going away from me. But to come close to me is going to be arduous and difficult, because everybody wants freedom. At least, everybody THINKS that they want freedom. But I rarely come across a man who really wants freedom; he thinks he wants freedom. Because to be free\nmeans to be nobody. If you are somebody, that 'somebodiness' will be your imprisonment.\nTo find infinite space means that you will have to dissolve. Because you create, you go on creating your boundaries around you. To move to the wild sea, uncharted, you will have to throw all your maps, all your scriptures, all your religions, all your concepts and ideologies. To move into space which has no boundaries to it, is to die: to die to the known and to trust the unknown, which is the most difficult thing in the world.\nI will tell you one story. It is a very ancient story, and one of the most beautiful I have ever come across.\nThere was a very wise king. His own prime minister committed a betrayal: he delivered some secrets to the neighboring country, to the enemy. The prime minister was caught red-handed. There was only one punishment for it, and that was death. But the old king had always loved this man. He was sentenced to death, but the old man gave him an opportunity. The last day, he called his whole court. On one side there was a gun ready to kill the man, on the other side there was a black door. And the king said,'You can choose, either to die -- you have to die -- or you can choose this black door. It is up to you.' The prime minister asked,'What is behind that black door?' The king said,'That is not allowed. Nobody knows, because nobody has chosen it before. In the times of my father, in the times of my grandfather, many times the opportunity had been given, but nobody has chosen and nobody knows. And nobody is allowed; even I don't know. I have the key, but when my father died he said to me,'I will open the door and you can go in and I will close it. Don't look into it.' But you can see because\n-- you can choose. You can discover what is there. It is up to you.'\nThe prime minister brooded and brooded, and then he chose the gun. He said,'Kill me with the gun. I don't want to go behind that black door.' The prime minister was killed. The queen was very curious. She persuaded the king somehow to see what was behind it. The king laughed. He said,'I know -- there is nothing behind it. It's simple freedom; there is not even a room. This door opens to the wide world. There is nothing, but nobody has chosen it yet.'\nPeople even choose death before choosing the unknown. People even choose to be miserable before choosing the unknown. The unknown seems to be more dangerous than death itself. And freedom is the door unknown. Freedom means\nmoving into the unknown, not knowing where one is going, not knowing what is going to happen the next moment. It is a black door. Rarely, sometimes a Jesus or a Buddha choose the door; all else choose the gun.\nYou are dying every day, but you still cling to this life which gives you nothing except death. You choose death, you don't choose real life. Real life is hazardous, insecure. You talk about wild seas, you talk about infinite spaces: look into me, and you will get scared. Look deeply into me, and you will become afraid. There is only one way to come near me, and that is to love. To love me is to die to the past. To love means to trust, to surrender. And there is no problem. If you really love open spaces and the wild sea, I invite you.\nThe fifth question:\nQuestion 5\nIT IS FROM A NEW SEEKER, GREG EWART.\nOSHO, I WANT TO BECOME A SANNYASIN; BUT SURRENDER MEANS LOVE, AND I HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED LOVE, NOR HAVE I EVER\nESTABLISHED A MEANINGFUL RELATIONSHIP WITH ANYONE ELSE. IF I TAKE SANNYAS NOW, MY DECISION TO DO SO WOULD BE AN\nINTELLECTUAL, MAYBE A HYPOCRITICAL ONE. I WOULD FEEL AS\nTHOUGH I WERE USING YOU. HOW CAN I BECOME A SIMPLE, SINCERE\nSANNYASIN?\nI am the black door -- and there is no other way to know me except by entering me. You say you have never loved. Unless you love, how will you know? You say you have never been in any deep, intimate relationship. Unless you are, how you are going to know it?\nLove, surrender, trust, are like swimming. You have to go to the river. You cannot make it a condition that you will not get into the river unless you know swimming. If you make that condition you will never learn, because there is no\nother way to learn it. You have to go, cautiously of course, slowly of course; there is no need to go to the deepest part. But enter -- find a spot where you can learn swimming and where you are not afraid to die.\nDon't enter into me, just give your hand to me. That's what sannyas is. It is just a beginning, the beginning of the beginning. It is just a gesture on your part that you are ready to come with me. When you go swimming, you have to trust the Master who teaches you. It is dangerous, because who knows? But if you trust, by and by, you become capable, capable of going to the deeper parts of the river.\nOnce you know swimming, then there iB no fear. Whether it is Six feet deep, or six thousand feet deep makes no difference once you know swimming.\nI don't say take the jump. I simply say, slowly enter the river. Remain near the bank where you can feel that any time, if there is danger, you can get back to the bank. Just give your hand to me, just trust. And there is no other way.\nTo know what trust is, one haB to trust. To know what love is, one has to love.\nYou have been missing your whole life because you have never allowed the unknown to enter into your life. You wanted first to make it known.\nAgain you are doing the same. You want to become a sannyasin: it is natural that in the beginning it is going to be a decision on your mind's part. Your mind will have to decide. And naturally, it will only be part of your mind. It cannot be total. By and by, it will become total. Sometimes it may not even be the major part, it may be the minor part. Ten percent -- of you would like to become a sannyasin, and ninety percent of you is afraid, but the ninety percent that is afraid is already dead. You have lived that ninety percent, and you have found nothing.\nThis is the quality of courage: to be always ready to search the unknown, the yet undiscovered. Because that which you have discovered has been found futile.\nMove, be courageous. There are treasures to be discovered; you are carrying them. I am not going to give you anything that you do not already have. You have it. You have the treasure, you have the key. At the most, I can show you how to unlock, how to use the key. At the most, I can show you where the Lock iB and where the key is within you. I can bring together the key part and the lock part? that's all. The treasure is yours, it is already there. But you will have to do\nsomething.\nIn the beginning, you will do it hesitantly. In the beginning you may even feel that it is hypocritical, because you are not total. Good -- this is a good indication, that you are afraid of being hypocritical. It is a good indication that you would like to take sannyas, and yet you know that only part of you does, and that too you are not certain about whether it is real, imaginary, illusory, or deceptive.\nOne has to move in spite of all the doubts: that's what courage is. To be a courageous man does not mean that you have no fears. A man who has courage, and a cowards are not different basically. The coward has idea to move into the dark, into the unknown, and the brave man also has the fear. But the brave man is one who listens to the call of the unknown in spite of the barriers of the known, and the coward is one who listens to the known in spite of the call of the unknown. He listens to the known, and the courageous man listens to the unknown; that is the only dirference.\nBoth parts exist in every person. Every brave man has his coward behind him, but he does not listen to it. And every coward has his brave qualities hidden within him, but he has not listened to them. And to whatsoever part you listen, you become that.\nSo take courage. Always take the invitation of the. unknown and your life will become an adventure.\nA sannyasin is one who has accepted life as an adventure, as a pilgrimage, as a river flowing to the ocean.\nThe sixth question:\nQuestion 6\nI SOMETIMES FEEL SUCH A FEAR OF MISSING, AS IF I WERE IN A SCHOOL, AND IF I DIDN'T DO THE RIGHT THING I WOULD FLUNK OUT.\nYes, you ARE in a school. This is a school. We are learning to be ourselves here; we are trying the greatest adventure there is -- of discovering oneself, of reaching to one's own innermost core. It is a learning place, it is a school. But the whole point is, the whole teaching of THIS school is not to be worried about\nright and wrong, not to be worried about good and bad, not to be worried about morality and difference, not to be worried about lower and higher.\nThe whole point of this school is to become choiceless.\nNow I will read the question again:'I sometimes feel such a fear of missing, as if I were in a school, and if I didn't do the right thing I would flunk out.'\nThis is the right thing here: not to be worried about right and wrong. To accept oneself is the right thing here, to accept yourself, whatsoever you are, howsoever you are; to accept in totality and in deep humbleness that this is the way you are, that this is the way God intended you to be.\nWe are not trying to change you, we are not trying to improve you, we are not trying any ego-trip. We are simply trying to help you discover who you are. So the right thing here is not to be worried about right and wrong, not to be worried about this and that. We are not going to choose a character, a morality, a code of conduct. No, we are trying to find out who we are. Once you know who you are, no code of conduct is needed, no conceptions of right and wrong are needed.\nOnce you know who you are, all that you do is right. And, if you don't know who you are, all that you do is wrong.\nSo, we are not worried about right and wrong. The seventh question:\nQuestion 7\nOSHO, PLEASE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO ME?\nThis is from Madhuri.\nI am killing you Madhuri. I am a murderer, and you are trapped. You cannot escape me now because once you have tasted a little death, you cannot escape.\nBecause now you know much more is going to come. Once you have tasted a little death of the ego, you know, you can imagine now, you can dream of what a beautiful space is going to be there when the whole ego disappears: when you look within yourself and you don't find anybody there, just emptiness, vast\nemptiness. If you have found a little empty corner in your being, then you cannot move away now. You have tasted.\nNow, you cannot go back to the ordinary world. Unless you die, there is no going back. Once you die, I will send you back to the ordinary world, because then nothing can corrupt you. Who can corrupt an emptiness? How can an emptiness be corrupted? It is open, absolutely vulnerable, and yet invulnerable, because nobody can corrupt it. It is incorruptible, it is virgin.\nThe eighth question:\nQuestion 8\nWHAT DID JESUS MEAN WHEN HE SAID IN HIS SERMON ON THE MOUNT,'BLESSED ARE THE POOR IN SPIRIT'?\nThat's what I am calling emptiness, SHUNYA, poor in spirit: those who are nobodies, who cannot claim anything, who have no claims to make -- who are just nobodies.\nLet me tell you one anecdote: A Sufi sage once asked his disciples to tell him what their vanities had been before they began to study with him. The first said,'I imagined that I was the most handsome man in the world.' The second said,'I believed that, since I was religious, I was one of the elect, the chosen few.' The third said,'I believed I knew, and I also believed that I could teach.' And the fourth said,'My vanity was greater than all these, for I believed that I could learn.'\nThe sage remarked,'And the fourth disciple's vanity still remains the greatest, for his vanity is to show that he once had the greatest vanity. It still remains the greatest.'\nYou can become egoistic about your humbleness also. To be poor in spirit means simply to be nobody, not even humble. A humble man is not poor in spirit, a humble man is ego, upside-down, ego in a see saw, a head stand. A humble man is not REALLY humble. A humble man is not humble at all, because humility is also a function of the ego. When the ego disappears, humbleness also disappears.\nWhen you are gone, where can the shadow fall? When you are gone, there is not\neven shadow. When the ego is gone, humbleness also disappears; it is a shadow of the same disease.\nThe poor in spirit is one who has come to understand that he is not. To know that one is not is to know that one is part of the whole:'The whole is, I am not.' The ocean is, the drop is not. And the poor in spirit is the richest man there is, the richest that is possible. The poor in spirit is the richest, because the emptiest is the fullest. Here, death means life.\nAnd when I say I am a murderer, I simply mean that I am a midwife. Here, destroying you means giving you rebirth -- a new being, a being without any ego.\nThe ninth question:\nQuestion 9\nWITHOUT ANY REASON I DO SOME JOBS IN A HURRY; ESPECIALLY EATING.\nThis is from Vishnu Chaitanya.\nVishnu Chaitanya, something is eating you: some deep worry is inside that creates hurry; some deep tension which does not allow you to relax.\nSo, the next time you are eating something, watch what is eating you. When you are hurrying, just watch. Are you escaping from somewhere? Are you trying to avoid some situation? Are you trying not to see something which is there inside you? Are you trying to suppress something? Is there some worry and you don't even want to accept that it is there? Is there some wound which you are hiding in flowers? Watch deep down. All people who are in a hurry simply show that they are carrying some deep worry, and they are not even courageous enough to face it. Bring it up, let it surface. Encounter it, and you will be simply surprised. If you can encounter any problem face to face, directly, it disappears. In the inner world, to know that a problem is, to know exactly what it is, to diagnose, is to treat. There is no other medicine in the inner world. A problem only exists if you go on suppressing it. If you don't allow it to be confronted, it exists. And people go on piling many problems, and then they are always in a hurry. In their hurry they are trying to evade; because if they rest, silently sit, they Will have to face.\nSo they are CONSTANTLY in a hurry, running, doing this and that. Only when they fall asleep, then apparently are they at rest; but deep down not even then.\nThen, in their dreams and in their nightmares, they are travelling, and hurrying, and running.\nMany people come to me and they say that a certain dream occurs continuously.\nAnd this is one of the most common dreams: that one is hurrying in the dream towards the station, and by the time one reaches the platform, the train leaves.\nThis is a very common dream. What does it mean? It means that you are always and always missing the point, missing the target. And the whole point of worry is that it needs to be recognized, it needs to be paid attention to, it needs to be brought into the consciousness.\nAll the group therapies that we are doing here are nothing but to bring out all that is repressed, to help it to surface so that it comes into the consciousness.\nOnce any problem comes into the consciousness, it disappears. It is just as if you watch, sit near a river and watch. If the water is clean you can see bubbles coming up. A few bubbles, just on the bottom, go on clinging; they will remain. If any bubble comes up, the closer it comes to the surface the bigger it becomes; because with less pressure of the water, it becomes bigger. When it comes to the surface, it is the biggest. It may have been just a small bubble at the bottom, but on the surface it is a big bubble. But then within seconds it erupts, it is gone.\nThe same, exactly the same happens whenever you are suppressing something. It may be a very small thing, and you are afraid to bring it to consciousness because when it comes towards the conscious it starts becoming bigger and bigger; the repression is less and less, and the pressure is less. It becomes bigger, you become afraid. You force it back again. Many people who start meditating here come to me and they say,'We were never so worried as we are now.' Or they say?'We were never so sad,' or,'We were never so miserable,' or,'We were never so much in anguish and anxiety.' Their bubbles are becoming bigger because they are coming nearer to the surface. This is a good sign, a healthy sign that something is happening I tell them: Be happy, feel grateful that something is happening. The bubbles are leaving the bottom of your being and coming to the surface. Once they come to the surface, they explode, because then there is no pressure on them and they cannot exist.\nA problem can exist only through pressure. No problem can exist without pressure; it disappears. The whole point of all the therapies here is to bring all your problems to the surface. Know, watch, become aware, and the problem disappears. Knowledge -- rather, knowing -- is transformation. Don't ask,'Once we know the problem is there, what has to be done?' If you really know it, it is no more there.\nThis is the beauty of the inner world: once you know a thing, it is no longer there.\nIt remains only if you go on forcing it, repressing it, avoiding knowledge, avoiding recognition.\nProblems exist through your ignorance, through your unconsciousness.\nConsciousness is the solution. Remember, I call it the SOLUTION. It has nothing to do with any particular problem. Every and all problems disappear through it -\n- it is THE SOLUTION.\nThe tenth question:\nQuestion 10\nSO MANY QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN ASKED OF YOU. IS THERE A LIMIT AFTER WHICH NO MORE NEW QUESTIONS CAN BE FOUND?\nIf your question is authentic, then there is a limit. But if your questions are borrowed, borrowed from the books, borrowed from others, borrowed from knowledge and information, then there is no limit. If your question is true, relevant to your being, then there is a limit. Sooner or later you will come to it; they are finished. But if they are scholarly, then there is no limit to it.\nLet me tell you one anecdote.\nIt happened: The lady of the house was out when her new maid called at her home and rang the bell. The pet parrot answered by calling,'Who is that?'\n'It is the new maid,' was the reply. There was a pause. Then the girl rang the bell again, and the parrot answered,'Who is that?'\n'It is the new maid,' came the reply once more. She was a little annoyed. This went on until the exasperated girl fell on the ground and fainted, because she would say,'It is the new maid,' and the parrot would ask again,'Who is that?'\nbecause that was the only question he could ask. That was a borrowed question; it was not his question. He didn't even know what it meant.\nReturning home, the householder stumbled across the body, and exclaimed,'Who is that!'\n'It is the new maid,' answered the parrot, because by now he had learned it. The eleventh question:\nQuestion 11\nYOU SEEM TO ADVOCATE COMMITMENT AND NON-ATTACHMENT IN\nLOVE, WHETHER WITH MASTER OR LOVER. I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW\nONE CAN BE COMMITTED AND UNATTACHED AT THE SAME TIME.\nIn fact, they always happen together, they cannot happen separately. It is impossible to separate them, because they are two aspects of the same coin: commitment and unattachment. If you are attached, then it is not a commitment.\nThen you are using the other for yourself because it is an attachment.\nYou love a person and you say,'I am committed and attached.' What does attachment mean? It means that you are using the other person for yourself, you are using the other person as a means. How can one be committed to a means?\nCommitment is possible only towards an end, not towards a means. You cannot be committed to a car, you cannot be committed to a house. They are means; they have to be used. You can only Be committed to an alive person, because\neach person is the goal.\nLove is not using the person for your own pleasure. Much pleasure comes through it, but that is a by-product. You love the person as an end; you are committed. You can give your very life to the person, but there is no attachment, because attachment means that you are using the person for yourself.\nCommitment with nonattachment means that now the other has become the goal, the end, the very end. They always happen together, and if they cannot happen together then you are missing something. If commitment is with attachment, then you are just deceiving yourself that it is a commitment. Sooner or later, if the person dies, you will find another person -- because you were using the person. Now that he is not available, you will find another person.\nA commitment is eternal. Your wife dies: on that day, all women disappear from the world for you. You loved her as a goal. Now it is even impossible to conceive that you can love another. It was so total that nothing is left behind. And it was so total that only the body can die, not the soul of that being. Death cannot part two lovers. If they really loved, they had conquered death already. Love is immortal. But if there was only an attachment, then after a few weeks or a few days the wound is healed. You loved the person because of you, for your own pleasure. Now you will find another person. In fact, you love your husband, you say that you love, and he's dying -- or your wife -- and when the wife is dying, on the deathbed, if somebody could open a window in your head and look, you are already planning and trying to find a new woman.\nThe mind, at the most, exploits. It can never become a deep commitment. Deep commitment is of being. It knows no time, it knows no death. I am not saying that it is permanent, because permanence is part of time. It is eternal. It has the fragrance of divineness.\nLet me tell you one anecdote: A politician named Strange lay dying. A friend asked him what he would like inscribed on his tombstone,'Just put,' said the politician: Here lies an honest politician.\n'But,' said the friend,'that doesn't tell who it is.'\n'Oh yes, replied the politician,'the passer-by will say,'That is strange -- a politician, and honest?' -- no need to say the name. Passers-by will by themselves say,'That is strange.'\nAttachment and love never go together; commitment and attachment never go together. Love goes with unattachment. Then love has a purity of the other world. Then love is absolute essence, absolute pureness, innocence. And then there is a commitment. That commitment is eternal.\nThe twelfth question:\nQuestion 12\nYOU SEEM TO EMPHASIZE DIFFERENT POINTS EVERY DAY: BEING\nORDINARY, BEING AWARE, BEING MEDITATIVE, AND SO ON. IF I TRY TO\nPRACTICE THEM ALL I GET CONFUSED TRYING TO REACH A HARMONY\nOF ALL. SHOULD I JUST FORGET, AND BE SPONTANEOUS?\nYou have got the point exactly, precisely. That is the whole point: be spontaneous.\nAnd whatsoever I am saying is not contradictory. You can get confused because you are already confused. And in your confusion, when my words enter they create even more confusion -- because a confused mind can only create more confusion, nothing else.\nWhat I am saying is not contradictory at all. It may appear so sometimes, but it is not.\nLet me tell you a Sufi story.\nAn interchange between a Sufi and an enquirer:'Which statement should one choose if two Sufi sayings contradict each other?'\n'They only contradict one another if viewed separately. If you clap your hands and observe only the movement of the hands, they appear to oppose one another. You have not seen what is happening. The purpose of the opposition of the palms was, of course, to produce the hand clap. If I clap my hands they are opposing each other, but there is a synthesis in the sound; the opposition is\ncreating a synthesis.'\nI go on talking of so many different things to create a certain sound in you. That sound is spontaneity. If you have understood that, you have understood rightly.\nThe last question:\nQuestion 13\nDEAR OSHO, HELLO.\nI will tell you an anecdote.\nA persistent man said that he would teach a parrot to say 'hello' in an hour. He went close to the parrot's cage, and started saying,'Hello, hello.' This went on for a full thirty minutes without the parrot giving the slightest attention. At last the bird turned his head slowly, blinked at the man, and said,'Number engaged.'\nI will not say anything else about it.\nYou say 'hello'? You don't know; it can be said to me only through your being.\nOtherwise, the number is engaged. Words won't reach me. You will have to say them through your total being; otherwise, the number is engaged.\nCome Follow To You, Vol 4 Chapter #11 Chapter title: Behold my Hands and my Feet 31 December 1975 am in Buddha Hall Luke 24\n36 AND AS THEY THUS SPAKE, JESUS HIMSELF STOOD IN THE MIDST OF\nTHEM, AND SAITH UNTO THEM: PEACE BE UNTO YOU.\n37 BUT THEY WERE TERRIFIED AND AFRIGHTED, AND SUPPOSED\nTHAT\nTHEY HAD SEEN A SPIRIT.\n38 AND HE SAID UNTO THEM: WHY ARE YE TROUBLED? AND WHY DO\nTHOUGHTS ARISE IN YOUR HEARTS?\n39 BEHOLD MY HANDS AND MY FEET, THAT IT IS I MYSELF. HANDLE ME\nAND SEE, FOR A SPIRIT HATH NOT FLESH AND BONES, AS YE SEE ME HAVE.\n40 AND WHEN HE HAD THUS SPOKEN, HE SHEWED THEM HIS HANDS\nAND HIS FEET.\n41 AND WHILE THEY YET BELIEVED NOT FOR JOY, AND WONDERED, HE\nSAID UNTO THEM: HAVE YE HERE ANY MEAT?\n42 AND THEY GAVE HIM A PIECE OF A BROILED FISH, AND OF AN HONEYCOMBE.\n43 AND HE TOOK IT, AND DID EAT BEFORE THEM.\n45 THEN OPENED HE THEIR UNDERSTANDING, THAT THEY MIGHT UNDERSTAND THE SCRIPTURES.\n46 AND SAID UNTO THEM: THUS IT IS WRITTEN, AND THUS IT BEHOVED\nCHRIST TO SUFFER, AND TO RISE FROM THE DEAD THE THIRD DAY.\n47 AND THAT REPENTANCE AND REMISSION OF SINS SHOULD BE PREACHED IN HIS NAME AMONG ALL NATIONS, BEGINNING AT JERUSALEM.\n48 AND YE ARE WITNESSES OF THESE THINGS.\nTHE greatest problem that a man like Jesus faces is that whatsoever he is going to say will appear untrue to people -- because truth cannot be said; and the moment you say it, it is falsified. Truth cannot be uttered. The language in which you utter it is not big enough. It kills the truth, it can only express the untrue.\nBut, out of compassion, a Jesus, a Buddha, will try to say that which cannot be said. But then they will be misunderstood. They bring news of the beyond. You have not even dreamed about it; how can you understand? You have no conception of it; how can you understand? Misunderstanding is natural. Nobody is actually at fault. Jesus brings something from the beyond. You have never been there -- something of the other world. You listen:'This man appears authentic.\nHis very being gives some authority to whatsoever he is saying.' But that is a feeling -- you cannot understand what he is saying. At the most you can trust, which is very difficult, almost impossible.\nHow to trust? How to trust somebody else about things which you know nothing about? Not only that, but how to trust about things which go diametrically opposite to your experience?\nI was reading a small story the other night.\nA man was walking along, and he saw a snail lodged in a crevice in a wall, and for no particular reason he said,'Hello snail.'\nAnd oddly enough the snail could speak, and the snail could hear, and it said,'Hello.' And it moved its eyes around as best it could on their stalks to try to see what it was that was confronting him.\nSo the man said,'Can you hear me?' And the snail said,'Yes, of course. Who and what are you anyway?'\nThe man said,'Well, I am a man.' And the snail said,'Whatever is that?'\nSo the man said,'Well, we are something like you. For instance, you have got eyes on stalks and we have got stalks on the other end.'\nThe snail said,'The other end?'\nAnd the man said,'Yes -- just a minute -- it is for putting our feet on, you see, these feet.'\nThe snail said,'Whatever are these feet for?'\nAnd the man said,'The feet are for moving along very rapidly on.'\nThe snail said,'Really? You amaze me. Is there anything, else about you that is peculiar?'\nAnd the man said,'Well, you know how you have got your house on your back?' The snail said,'Yes, yes.'\nAnd the man said,'Well, we don't know. You see, we have lots and lots of houses, and we go in and out of them almost at will.'\nThe snail said,'You really are a most astonishing creature. Is there anything else that's strange about you?'\nAnd the man said,'Well now, we are men, and a man can take a thing like a leaf; you know, a leaf?'\nAnd the snail said,'Yes. Yes, I know a leaf.'\nThe man said,'Well, he can make marks on this leaf, and even hand the leaf to another man, who can give the leaf to a third man, who can tell from the marks on the leaf what the first man was thinking about.'\n'Ah,' said the snail,'I see, you are one of them. Hm '\nThe man said,'What do you mean?'\n'You are a liar,' said the snail.'The trouble with you liars is that you tell one lie, and then you tell a bigger one, and then finally you over-reach yourselves.'\nThat's the feeling with a man like Jesus. Ordinary humanity feels that way: that Jesus is over-reaching himself. Maybe he has a magnetic personality, a charisma around him. Maybe he is a powerful man, a beautiful person. Maybe he has a certain convincing force in him. He is a man worth loving, but he is over- reaching himself. Whatever he is saying is beyond the ordinary human mind. In fact, it is beyond the human mind. He is bringing something into the world of the mind from the world of no-mind. This is an almost unbridgeable gap. He is bound to be misunderstood.\nIn misunderstanding he was crucified. And when on the cross he said,'Father, forgive these people, because they know not what they are doing,' it was not just compassion, it was not just love. It was compassion, it was love; it was also fact.\nThose people who were crucifying him, in fact, were fast asleep, unconscious.\nWhatsoever they were doing, they were not aware of it. They had never thought about the implications of it. They were not crucifying Jesus, they were simply crucifying a liar, they were simply crucifying someone who had been disturbing their silent, peaceful lives, who had been forcing them against their wills on an adventure which seemed dangerous, who had been talking about God, which everybody knows does not exist, and yet everybody believes in as a social formality.\nJesus was trying to prove that God exists, not as a social formality, not as a prop for morality, not as a hypothesis to explain the unexplainable. God exists. In fact, ONLY God exists: He is the ultimate fact. Whenever people like Jesus start talking about the ultimate fact, a suspicion arises in the ordinary mind:'They are over-reaching themselves. It's okay to believe in God, and to believe in the church and in the temple. It is good to pretend to be religious. It helps -- it is a social lubricant. It gives life a certain smoothness; it gives you a certain respectability. But one should not take these things too seriously. This man Jesus seems to be too serious about it, as if it is a life-and-death problem.'\nTo him, it is the only problem worth encountering, and the only adventure worth going on, the only research. But to the people he was talking to, it looked like nonsense. They may not have said so; they may not have said so out of propriety.\nThey may not have said that they didn't believe, because they would not like to have been known by others as unbelievers. But deep down, it didn't seem probable that God exists; it was the most improbable thing, that God exists. Jesus looks untrue, a Buddha looks untrue. Out of their sheer magnetism people are fascinated. But even those who are fascinated are not totally with them. Their deepest core goes on denying and saying,'You are hypnotized. This man has done something to you, like magic. He has trapped you, you have become a prisoner.' When the people start feeling like this, they take revenge. This revenge happens almost automatically.\nThe people who killed Jesus killed in their sleep, as if it was just a dream.\nThere is a Sufi anecdote: A group of merchants asked a certain disciple,'How can this Sufi nonsense mean anything to you?'\nTo the ordinary mind, to the logical, to the rational part of you, anything that is not comprehensible is nonsense. In fact, it is, because it is beyond sense. If you love it, you may call it super-sense. If you don't love it, you may call it nonsense.\nBut one thing is certain: that it is something beyond the scope of the senses.\nA group of merchants asked a certain disciple,'How can this Sufi nonsense mean anything to you?' He said,'Because it means everything to those whom I respect.'\nBecause it means everything to those whom I respect... this is what trust is.\nJesus creates a respect about his being. Because of that respect, you believe whatsoever he says. Because of that respect, a certain trust is created, but your rational mind goes on hammering within you and saying,'This is all nonsense.\nWhat are you doing?' And when I say this to you, you can understand, because this is happening to you every day also: whatsoever I am saying to you is nonsense. There is no need for anybody else to prove that it is nonsense; it is nonsense. But if you respect me and love me, that nonsense will start appearing as super-sense, as transcendental to mind, reason, logic -- not below, but above.\nIf you respect me and love me, you may allow me to take you over to another world in which you cannot believe right now.\nAlmost every day people come to me and they say,'How can we believe?' I\nunderstand their problem, their anguish: they would like to believe. It is not that they want not to believe, because belief gives such serenity, belief gives such tranquility, belief gives such a centeredness and rootedness, that who would not like to believe? Even an atheist is in search of belief. Maybe he is very desperate; maybe his saying that there is no God is nothing but an effort to avoid that great call that is constantly heard in his being -- 'Go on the adventure. Seek and find.'\nHe does not want to hear that call. He says that there is no God.\nI have never come across an atheist who is really an atheist. All atheists are in search, all atheists are in deep search for a faith and trust. But they are afraid. The adventure seems to be so dangerous and risky. They start believing in no- God, but that no-God is also a belief. It is negative: it cannot be nourishing, it cannot give you life, energy; it cannot enhance your being, it cannot help you to become centered. It cannot help you to see the true and the real because it is a false belief, a negative belief. But, I say, it is still a belief.\nThere are only believers and believers, because nobody can live in non-belief, in no-belief, in no-faith, in no-trust. To live without believing is absolutely impossible. But the first dawn of truth always happens with what this Sufi disciple is saying:'Because it means everything to those whom I respect.' If you respect, you are open to receive.\nThe Judaic word 'kabala' originally means: capacity to receive. It is a beautiful word. It means: those who are ready to receive; they are kabalists. Respect creates the capacity to receive, to become pregnant. Not knowing what is going to happen, but you trust somebody, you respect somebody.\nPeople respected Jesus. They started following him, but then deep down they also always felt that he was over-reaching. He was taking them so fast and so beyond human comprehension, that by and by they became frightened and scared of this man. They had to kill him, there was no other way.\nThey must have felt relieved when they killed Jesus. They must have felt a stillness descending, because this man had been creating a chaos. This man had been creating such turmoil. He had to create it, because only out of chaos are stars born, and only out of chaos and pain and anguish is a new birth possible.\nBut he was looking into the future, and they were clinging to the past, and there\nwas no meeting ground. Even today, between Christ and a Christian there is no meeting ground. The meeting ground is possible only if you also try to over- reach yourself. Otherwise, the meeting ground is not possible.\nA friend of mine, an old navy chaplain, tells of a terrible storm a couple of years ago, a storm so severe that even old seamen were scared.\nAfter it was all over, an old salt-crusted sailor said,'Chaplain, I sure did pray during the blow. I am not a praying man, but I prayed hard that time.'\n'What did you say in your prayer?' asked the chaplain.\n'Oh,' replied the sailor,'I said: Lord, you know that I have not asked you for anything for fifty years, and if you get me out of this storm alive, I promise that I won't bother you again for another fifty years!'\nOnly in pain, in anguish, only in a chaos where everything is dissolving into nothingness, does one remember God. A Jesus has to create a chaos, a Jesus has to destroy your notions of security, your so-called comfortable life, the illusion of it. He has to dis-illusion you, and that's why he looks like the enemy. The friend looks like the enemy; the greatest friend looks like the greatest enemy because he has to disillusion you. He has to bring you out of your illusions and dreams. He has to create a chaos, because only in that anguish, you may start praying. Jesus did both. He lived a life of infinite delight; he lived a life of constant celebration, he was one of the most dancing men ever on this earth.\nDon't listen to the Christians who say that he never laughed: it is impossible. If Jesus never laughed, then I would like to say to you that he never existed. Then the whole story is false. Jesus, and never laughed? -- then who will be able to laugh? He laughed -- his laughter may have been very subtle -- you may not have heard it. That much I can understand. His delight must have been very subtle and profound. You may not have been able to see it; that I can understand.\nHis celebration must have been so deep that you could not go that deep, and you could not feel it. He lived out of his heart, he lived out of his depth. You may have missed, because to look into the depth of a man like Jesus or Buddha is to look into abyss: one gets dizzy, one becomes frightened, one closes one's eyes.\nIt is possible that people didn't become aware of Jesus' celebration, but he was a man of celebration. He enjoyed the small things of life. He made everything\nsacred. He was not an escapist, he did not renounce anything. In fact, whatsoever he touched became sacred, wherever he moved became holy ground.\nWhatsoever he did, just because he did it, the quality of it was transformed. He lived a life of celebration on the one hand; on the other hand, he continuously created chaos around you. He was living at two ends together: that is his cross.\nThat is the meaning of his carrying his cross on his shoulders: he is living two polarities together. He is a paradox, he creates chaos, and you can see him dancing amidst the chaos; because these are the two points to remember God.\nEither you remember Him when you are in deep trouble -- which is the way of ordinary humanity -- or you remember Him when you are at a peak of happiness, of bliss -- which is not the way of ordinary humanity. When you are happy, you forget God; whenever you are unhappy, you remember.\nJesus created both possibilities together. He created a disillusionment for you, so that you were in anguish and you could pray. Out of your anguish tears can come, and you melt into prayer. You can again call God 'the Father', the whole.\nAnd just near your chaos, He is celebrating. If you are capable of seeing, if you have eyes, then you will become aware that prayer has two possibilities: one, in unhappiness -- then it is out of helplessness; the other, in happiness -- then it is out of gratitude.\nJesus' prayer is different from your prayer: his prayer is of deep thankfulness, your prayer is of helplessness. But he presented both the possibilities together.\nOne day, a quivering man visited a Sufi Master to plead,'Please help me find myself.'\nDuring the discussion a messenger of the troubled man appeared.'I thought you would like to know,' said the messenger,'that your business affairs have taken a sudden turn towards prosperity.',\nThe visitor exclaimed to the Master,'Oh, I feel better now. Good-bye.'\nA month later, the still troubled man returned to repeat his sorrowful request,'Please help me! I cannot bear my agony any longer.'\nThe messenger appeared a second time, saying with a sly grin,'A beautiful woman awaits you at home.'\nThe visitor Leapt up to gasp,'All is well. Good-bye.'\nA friend of the Master asked him,'How often will that quivering man repeat that pattern of foolish behavior?'\nSighed the Master,'Until he sees.'\nJesus created chaos for you, because only in deep discomfort, in deep disillusionment, in total helplessness, is your prayer possible. And just by the side there, he was standing, happy, tremendously happy, prayerful -- a deep gratitude, a sheer delight in being, an ecstasy. Your prayer is out of agony, his prayer is out of ecstasy. And he was just standing by the side.\nIf you could see, you would take the jump. Your prayer would then no longer be of helplessness. Your prayer would also become of gratitude, of tremendous gratefulness. You are not helpless. You are helpless because you are thinking of yourself as separate from the whole.\nIt is your illusion of separateness that creates helplessness.\nThe helplessness is just your illusion. Once the illusion drops, you are the whole.\nJesus goes on saying,'I, and my Father who is in heaven, are one.' Then suddenly, you are not helpless. You are at the very center of existence -- how can you be helpless? You are not separate from the whole -- how can you be helpless?\nHelplessness is the shadow of the ego. Jesus tries to disillusion you so that the shadow of ego disappears.\nBut rather than moving with him, rather than accepting his invitation to go and follow him, people killed him. He was too much of a troublemaker; he was too much to be tolerated.\nSigmund Freud has written in one of his significant letters to a friend, 'Man cannot live without illusions.' Take away the illusion of a man and his whole life becomes meaningless. Everybody has a life-lie around which he lives. Take\naway the life-lie and the whole meaning disappears, the whole life collapses. Just watch inside yourself: you must have a life-lie, a dream which is not true; and you know it, because you have created it. But you don't want to know that. You go on avoiding the fact, that this is untrue; you go on believing that this is true.\nFreud's insight was right. He should know, because for fifty years continuously he was dealing with people's lives, their innermost minds. He must have come across it again and again.\nThe same is my observation: everybody is living for some illusion. Take the illusion away and the life collapses, and he will become your enemy. And that is what Jesus was doing, what Buddha was doing. This is what I am doing here: trying to take away your life-lie. Freud's insight was half true. It is true: take the life-lie of a man away and his life collapses; but this is only a half-truth. Help him to see the truth, then a new life arises. And until that new life arises you are simply waiting a great opportunity. A life of fantasy is not a life at all. Everybody has to pass through the cross'The cross' means: the cross of the life- lie. And everybody has to come to a resurrection. The resurrection means a life of truth, a life according to the real. The man, the ordinary man goes on trying to make the reality follow his lie. The courageous man, the religious man, drops the lie and follows reality. Don't try to make the truth follow you -- follow truth.\nThat is the meaning when Jesus says,'Come, follow me.' He is saying: drop your life-lies, your illusions about power, prestige, money, greed, jealousy, ego, and a thousand and one things. Drop those life-lies, come, follow me. Follow the true, follow the real. Truth liberates. But in the beginning, it is painful.\nRather than change themselves, people killed Jesus. Rather than killing their own egos, they found it easier to kill this man. Nobody is responsible, in fact. Jesus had to destroy their illusions, and in their sleep they had to react, so it is natural.\nThe sutras.\nJesus is crucified; the miracle has not happened. The crowd waited and went away home, frustrated. The disciples waited, hiding themselves in the crowd, because they were also suspicious, doubtful. They respected the man, they also had a certain faith in this man, but not that much. They could follow him when he was succeeding. Now, he was a failure. And nobody has failed like Jesus,\nbecause nobody has tried so hard to bring the beyond. Nobody has tried so hard to bring eternity into the world of time. He tried the impossible, and he failed.\nHis failure is beautiful.\nHe failed on the path of truth and it is better to fail on the path of truth than to succeed on the path of a lie. Failure and success don't mean anything. The effort, the intention, means everything.\nThe disciples were hiding in the crowd. They were not revealing themselves, who they were, because they were afraid. Their teacher, their Master, was being hanged. If they revealed themselves, who they were, they would also be hanged, or killed, or mistreated; or at least beaten. They were afraid. They were waiting for the miracle:'If the Master succeeds, if God descends from heaven, or angels descend from heaven and they save Jesus, and he reveals the glory about which he was always talking and about which nobody has ever believed totally ' They\nwere waiting. If the miracle happened, they would reveal themselves. Then they would shout,'We are the disciples!' But if he failed, they would simply disappear into the crowd. The fragile, the weak human mind.… There is nothing to condemn; one should just feel compassion.\nIt is an old story. It happened that in India there existed a great university, Nalanda was the name of the university. One visitor went to see the university.\nThe vice-chancellor of the university took the visitor. The visitor must have been a very important personage; he took him around. It is said that there were almost ten thousand students in the university. From almost all over the world, seekers would come to the university. The guest was very impressed.\nHe said,'My, just how many students do you have here?' \"Well,' answered the vice-chancellor thoughtfully,'I would say, about one in a hundred.'\nAnd if that was the number of students, what to say about disciples? -- about one in ten thousand. If you see ten thousand disciples, the possibility is that there may be, or may not even be, one disciple there. That is the proportion. When students are one in a hundred And a student has nothing to lose, just to gain.\nA disciple has everything to lose and nothing to gain, or ONLY NOTHING to gain.\nJesus had disciples, but they all disappeared. He died alone. In fact, he lived alone, he walked alone on this earth. The multitude that followed him, and the disciples who were around him were just so-so. Lukewarm was their trust. There was no intense passion in it, because when the Master was being crucified, there was the test. They were hiding themselves. They must have been greedy people, as all so-called religious people are.\nJust before Jesus was caught and imprisoned they were discussing amongst themselves,'In heaven, when Jesus will be sitting by the right side of God, what will be the position of the disciples, the twelve? Who will be sitting next to Jesus?' Of course they allowed Jesus to sit next to God; but who would be sitting next to Jesus? There was great argument amongst them. They were greedy people. They were just extending their ordinary minds into their so-called religious heaven. Their heaven was nothing but an extension of this earth. It was nothing new. Jesus remained alone, died alone.\nTry to understand this, because just to think that you are following when there is no danger is not enough. When death comes, when danger comes, then there will be the test. Then, not even a single disciple declared to be with him.\nIn fact, when Jesus was taken as a prisoner, Peter wanted to follow him. Jesus told him,'No need to follow me, because you will deny me.' Peter said,'Never! I will never deny you.' Jesus said,'You will deny me. Even before the cock crows and the sun has risen, you will have denied me thrice.' And it happened. All the disciples fled; only Peter followed. But those people who had made him prisoner became suspicious: somebody was amongst them who looked a stranger. They asked him,'Who are you? Are you a disciple of Jesus?' He said,'No, I don't know this man. Who is he?' And Jesus looked back and said,'The morning has not yet come.' And it happened a second time; and it happened thrice. Jesus laughed, and looked back at the crowd and said,'The cock has not crowed yet.'\nIt is so difficult to follow a Master when he is moving into death. And this the ONLY way to follow a Master, there is no other. Because a Master has to lead you into death; that is the only way to be reborn. There is no other. Until you die, you will not be able to be reborn. Only through death is eternal life attained, only through losing yourself do you gain.\nJesus died. No miracle happened. The crowd, feeling frustrated, disappeared.\nAND AS THEY THUS SPAKE, JESUS HIMSELF STOOD IN THE MIDST OF\nTHEM, AND SAITH UNTO THEM. PEACE BE UNTO YOU.\nThe disciples gathered and they discussed what to do now. They were feeling absolutely betrayed, deceived. This man simply proved not a real son of God. He had promised again and again that he would be resurrected, that he would come down out of death with a new, eternal body of light. And he died like an ordinary man; and he died complaining to God,'My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?' So.God had betrayed Jesus, Jesus had betrayed his disciples, and they were at a loss as to what to do now. They must have been a laughing-stock.\nPeople must have laughed at them:'These were Jesus' disciples -- fools, simpletons! They used to believe that this man would come out of death, and this man has simply died like an ordinary man.'\nAND AS THEY THUS SPAKE... as the disciples were discussing amongst themselves, JESUS HIMSELF STOOD IN THE MIDST OF THEM, AND SAITH\nUNTO THEM: PEACE BE UNTO YOU.\nThey were very troubled, in deep turmoil; their whole lives were lost. They had followed this man, and this man had simply died. Now what to do, where to go?\nWhere to hide oneself; how to accept the failure? They were very troubled. They must have been so troubled that Jesus was standing amongst them and they could not see him.\nIn fact, you can only see that which you are expecting to see. They were not expecting. In fact, they were thinking,'We knew that this was going to happen; this man has died and there has been no miracle.' The miracle had happened, but to see the miracle, to be able to see it, you need a different quality of being. The miracle was not a part of ordinary reality, it is a separate reality. The miracle had happened: Jesus was standing amongst them, and they could not see. It was as if they were almost blind.\nWe are -- almost blind, almost drunk. We only see that which we want to see, we only see that which we are expecting to see.\nHave you watched that your gestalt of vision continually changes? If you are hungry you see different things. You go to the marketplace and you are hungry; you see the restaurants, the hotels, the displayed foods, the fruits. You see things through your hunger. If you are not hungry and you go to the same marketplace, you don't see the restaurants, you don't see the food, the food stalls, the fruit sellers. You simply bypass them. They don't become part of your attention. If you are sexually starved, you go on looking at women or men. If you are not sexually starved, it simply does not matter who is who. Whether somebody who is approaching you is a man or a woman does not matter if you are not sexually starved. Whatsoever you see, it is not only the object that you see; your subjectivity gets involved in it.\nJesus was standing amongst them and he said to them,'Peace be unto you.' Why?\nHe said,'Just become peaceful, be silent. I am here. About whom are you talking?\nPeace be unto you.'\nBUT THEY WERE TERRIFIED. When they heard, when they became aware of this man suddenly standing amongst them, THEY WERE TERRIFIED AND\nAFRIGHTED, AND SUPPOSED THAT THEY HAD SEEN A SPIRIT, a ghost.\nFor this miracle they had been waiting. But just to wait is not enough; one has to be ready for it.\nIt happened once: An old man used to come to me. He said one night -- it must have been near about eleven o'clock and he was departing -- he said,'I would take sannyas, I would surrender myself to you totally if you could do one miracle.' I said,'What is the miracle?' He said,'If you can come tonight in my dream, tomorrow morning I am going to take sannyas.' I said,'Okay, but don't get frightened. Don't be afraid, don't get scared.' He said,'I am not scared'; but the way he said it, I felt that he was very scared. Then he went up to the gate, and he came back, and he said?'It is too dark, and the road is very quiet, and my house is far away, five, six miles, and in this cold night I don't want to go. I would like to stay here.' I said,'What is the matter? Are you afraid to go back home? Don't be afraid. At the most, if the miracle happens, I will come in your dream.' But he said,'Now, I must confess. I am afraid' -- even in a dream!\nWhat is the fear? -- because, if this is possible, a separate reality, a different reality opens its door to you. You have to face the unknown. He had asked for it, but he was afraid. He said,'No need to come. I will come and take sannyas.'\nIf I can enter in your dream, you will be scared. A dream is a very private thing: nobody can enter into anybody's dream. Ordinarily that is not possible. Even two lovers cannot enter into each other's dream. Dreaming is a totally private thing and if somebody can enter into your dream, suddenly your privacy is violated.\nOne becomes afraid. If somebody can enter into your dream, then somebody can watch your thoughts, and somebody can watch your feelings, and somebody can see your within... and the fear. Just think about it. If somebody could look into you and see your thoughts and your feelings, you would be scared to death.\nBecause everybody is carrying so many ugly things, and nobody can see that things are okay.\n'If you could see into each other,' psychologists say,'if people could see into each other, love would become impossible.' Friendship would never be possible; there would only be enemies in the world. Just think what you have been thinking about your lover: just a little anger, and you would like to kill him. If people could watch each other's minds, you would be completely violated; there would be fear. The man was afraid.\nThese people were asking for the miracles to happen. It had happened, but they were not ready. Because, to see a miracle one needs the vision to see it, one needs a totally different gestalt. The miracle is happening every moment -- the whole existence is miraculous and every moment of life is a miracle. You cannot find greater miracles than are already happening all around you. But you cannot know, you cannot see, you are not ready. You go on living in your drab and dull mind, almost asleep.\nI have heard: A welfare worker once said to a confirmed drunkard,'The last time we met I was very happy, because you were sober. Today I am unhappy to see you drunk again.''Well,' said the drunkard,'it is my turn to be happy today, sir.'\nYour happiness consists only of your unconsciousness. Whenever you are conscious, you become unhappy. And unless you can be consciously happy, your happiness is not worth the bother. I work on so many people: the moment they start becoming conscious they become unhappy. They come to me and they\nsay,'What are you doing? We had come here to become more happy, and the more we become conscious, the more unhappy we feel.' Because the happiness that consisted of their unconsciousness is disappearing, and that was all the happiness they knew. They have not known any happiness which is conscious.\nThey become unhappy, disillusioned.\nIf they escape, they miss the opportunity. If they persist, first the happiness of unconsciousness will disappear, and there will be a time, an interval of much agony, much chaos, much anarchy. They will lose all their identity. They will not be able to know who they are, because all that they knew about themselves belonged to their unconsciousness. They will be completely lost, almost mad.\nBut, if they persist, soon a new sort of happiness, a new sort of blissfulness which has nothing to do with illusions and unconsciousness arises. If you cannot be happy consciously, your happiness is not worthwhile; -it is useless. People go on living in their sleep -- sometimes their eyes are closed, sometimes their eyes are open, but the sleep continues. It is rarely broken!\nThose disciples were standing talking about Jesus, and Jesus was there. They could not see. It seems impossible. No, it is not impossible; it is just natural to human unconsciousness.\nOne day it happened: Mulla Nasrudin came to see me.'Why have you wrapped a thread around your finger?' I asked the Mulla.\nHe said,'My wife wrapped it to remind me that I should not forget to post a letter for her.'\n'Have you posted the letter?' I asked.\n'No,' said the Mulla,'she forgot to give it to me.'\nThis is how we go on living: without any selfremembering, without any awareness, without any consciousness.\nJesus said,'Peace be unto you'...\nBUT THEY WERE TERRIFIED AND AFRIGHTED, AND SUPPOSED THAT\nTHEY HAD SEEN A SPIRIT.\nAND HE SAID UNTO THEM: WHY ARE YE TROUBLED? AND WHY DO THOUGHTS ARISE IN YOUR HEARTS?\n'Can't you see me? Why are these thoughts arising in your minds and in your hearts? Can't you see me? Can't you recognize me? I lived for years with you, and you lived for years with me. Don't you know my face?'\nAND HE SAID UNTO THEM: WHY ARE YE TROUBLED? AND WHY DO THOUGHTS ARISE IN YOUR HEARTS?\nBEHOLD MY HANDS AND MY FEET, THAT IT IS I MYSELF.\nHANDLE ME AND SEE, FOR THE SPIRIT HATH NOT FLESH AND BONES, AS YE SEE ME HAVE.\nPitiable humanity... even Jesus has to bring proofs that he is. And the proofs that you ask are proofs of matter, of materiality. A Jesus, even a Jesus has to show you:'Behold my hands and my feet.' You cannot see, you cannot face the reality, the infinite reality that is confronting you. Hands and feet you can believe in; matter is needed. The immaterial becomes non-existential.'Handle me and see, for a spirit hath not flesh and bones as ye see me have.'\nHow far we have fallen into unconsciousness! How far we have become insensitive! We can only feel the most gross, we cannot feel the subtle.\nAnd when he had thus spoken, he showed them his hand and his feet.…\nPitiable humanity, that a Jesus has to give you evidence for his existence, and the evidence has to be material. He showed his hands and his feet.\nAND WHILE THEY YET BELIEVED NOT... because they were so frightened:'Who knows? That ghost may be playing tricks? Who knows? How can a dead man come back?' Jesus was crucified, they had seen him die:'How could he come? It is impossible. It is some trick, some ghost playing a game.'\nAND WHILE THEY YET BELIEVED NOT FOR JOY, AND WONDERED,\nHE SAID UNTO THEM: HAVE YE HERE ANY MEAT?\nThese are very symbolic words. Now he is coming to the grossest, because you cannot see the subtle. Even a Jesus has to descend to your plane; only then can you see him. You cannot see his peak, you can see only his feet, and even those are difficult to believe.\nHAVE YE HERE ANY MEAT?\nAND THEY GAVE HIM A PIECE OF A BROILED FISH, AND OF AN HONEYCOMBE.\nAND HE TOOK IT, AND DID EAT BEFORE THEM -- because a spirit cannot eat. Food is needed for the body. A Spirit has no body; food is irrelevant. And he ate meat, the grossest food. This is just symbolic.\nJesus' whole life is a life of silence, defined by parables.\nAND HE TOOK IT AND DID EAT BEFORE THEM.… Only then could they believe.\nIt is said that when he ate, then they recognized him because of the way, the manner. Nobody else could eat like Jesus. They had watched him eating with them for many years. Just three days before, there was the Last Supper. The manner of this man was totally different; it was not like anybody else. Whenever he ate, he would eat in such a prayerful mood, in such deep gratefulness, in such infinite delight, with such joy -- his eating was a celebration.\nOnly when he ate could they understand -- 'Yes, this seems to be our Jesus, because nobody else can bring such quality to such ordinary things as eating.'\nWhatsoever he touched became holy, wherever he moved became holy ground.\nI have heard an anecdote: An impressive dinner was given by a literary society in Milwaukee. At the conclusion Madame Mordjeska asked if she might not express her appreciation by giving a short Polish recitation. Otis Skinner, one of the guests, describes what she did:'Her liquid voice became by turns melancholy and gay; impatient, tragic, light with happiness and blighting with bitterness. There was not a note in the gamut of emotions she did not touch. She finished\nwith a recurrent rhythm, fateful and portentious. We were clutched by the spell. We did not know what it was about, but we knew it was something tremendous.\nSomeone asked what it was. She answered with a sly smile,'I merely recited the alphabet.'\nBut if you know how to sing, even an alphabet can become a tremendous song. If you know how to sing, if you know how to dance, then any movement of your body becomes tremendously meaningful. Then each gesture becomes graceful.\nThen each gesture exhibits something, manifests something of the unknown. Even an ordinary alphabet can become tremendously significant.\nJesus knew how to eat, he knew how to live, he knew how to love. Even the ordinary act of eating food became totally different -- the quality of it. Nobody else has ever eaten that way, walked that way, looked that way. He had to Come down to the most ordinary thing only because he hoped that his disciples might be able to recognize. And they recognized.\nTHEN OPENED HE THEIR UNDERSTANDING, THAT THEY MIGHT UNDERSTAND THE SCRIPTURES.…\nOnce they recognized, they were happy. Why did he try? Why did he make any effort? -- so that they might understand the scriptures. The scriptures go. on saying that you are deathless; all the scriptures of the world. It has, nothing to do with the scriptures of the Jews alone; all the scriptures of the world go on saying that you are deathless. Nobody except Jesus had given such a proof of it. Nobody had come after death to give witness that those scriptures were right. Not even a Buddha had given that proof; not even a Krishna had given that proof. It is unique to Jesus to come back from the doors of death, to descend back into the world, to become a witness to all scriptures. Jesus is the very embodiment of the foundational law of life: that everything is eternal and immortal, that nothing dies, that nothing can die; that there is only one thing that is a lie, and that is death. Only death is impossible and everything else is possible.\nTHEN OPENED HE THEIR UNDERSTANDING, THAT THEY MIGHT\nUNDERSTAND THE SCRIPTURES... the message of centuries, the one and only message of all religion -- that you are deathless... AND SAID UNTO THEM: THUS IT IS WRITTEN,. AND THUS IT BEHOVED CHRIST TO SUFFER, AND\nTO RISE FROM THE DEAD THE THIRD DAY.\nThis is very meaningful. Whenever you die, if you die unconsciously -- as everybody almost always dies -- then within three days you are reincarnated in a new body, you enter a womb. That's why in India the third day after anybody's death is very significant, because the third day is symbolic that person is reborn, has somewhere taken birth. If you die consciously, which only a Buddha. or a Jesus does, then it is up to you. You are not going to be born again in any other womb. Then it is up to you; you are totally free. If you want to descend, you can use the old body; if you don't want to descend back, you can disappear into the whole. In Jesus' case the old body was saved. After his crucification his body was put in a cave and the door of the cave was blocked by a rock. Now it is a mystery what happened, because the body disappeared from there.\nJesus belonged to a certain sect called Essenes. Jesus himself was trained by the Essenes, he was a disciple in their school. They had worked for him, they were his' Masters, they had prepared him. The Essenes were an esoteric group working almost in secret. When Jesus was crucified, they removed his body, they protected his body for three days. They helped, because if the body is not protected then the soul cannot descend back.\nIn India, we burn the body precisely for this purpose, so that the soul cannot enter into the old body. There is a tendency, even in unconscious souls -- a clinging to the old, a fear of the new. And if there is a choice between the old body and a new child's body in a womb, your mind will choose your old body.\nAnd there is a fear that the soul may enter back into the body, and that body is useless now rotten, old. It has to be dropped and changed. That's why in India we burn the body immediately, so that there is no possibility of the body being there for the soul to enter into. In any accident it should not be allowed. Only the bodies of saints, of people who die consciously, are not burned in India. They are preserved in special graves we call SAMADHIS. It is the same word we use for the fourth state of consciousness, of transcendence. We call the grave of a saint\n'samadhi'. His body is preserved there as a link. People who cannot be in direct contact with the saint can come to the body, and the body can function as a medium. Through the body they can still be in contact with the soul which has been lost into the whole, and they can be helped.\nJesus' body was preserved for three days by the Essenes, one of the most important groups on the earth, one of the most important esoteric groups. After three days Jesus entered his body again. Three days is a time limit. One needs to be out of the body for three days to be completely purified of all grossness, of all dust that clings to one's consciousness and soul.\nTHUS IT IS WRITTEN, AND THUS IT BEHOVE CHRIST TO SUFFER, AND TO\nRISE FROM THE DEAD THE THIRD DAY. And it was a prophecy in the old scriptures that this would happen: the third day Christ would come back, just to show that life is immortal.\nAND THAT REPENTENCE AND REMISSION OF SINS SHOULD BE PREACHED IN HIS NAME AMONG ALL NATIONS, BEGINNING AT JERUSALEM.\nAND YE ARE WITNESSES OF THESE THINGS.\n'And repentance and remission of sins': Jesus gave a proof that death is just a false notion. Nothing dies. Why is this proof needed? Because if the soul is immortal, then your whole life will have to be transformed. Then you will have to arrange your life in a totally different light. If only this life is all -- you begin with birth and you end with death -- then what is the meaning of virtue or sin?\nWhatsoever you do is irrelevant; one day everybody dies, sinner and saint. Dust unto dust -- nothing remain so what is the difference between virtue and sin? If life is mortal, then there is no difference. Then it is just a social utility, a convenience, but nothing of much importance.\nBut if the soul remains, if nothing dies, then there is a tremendous difference between virtue and sin. Virtue means: to live as if you are to live forever; sin means: to live without any consciousness of your eternity. Sin means to live in\nunconsciousness, virtue means to live in awareness.\nIf you become aware, you become aware of the deathless within you.\nIf you are unconscious, unaware, you are living only in the body, the mortal.\nAnd a person who lives for the body, in the body, and only for the body, lives in sin. Jesus gave the proof.\nAND THAT REPENTANCE AND REMISSION OF THE SINS SHOULD BE PREACHED IN HIS NAME AMONG ALL NATIONS, BEGINNING AT JERUSALEM.\nAnd he said to his disciples,'Now go and spread whatsoever you have seen all over the earth. Go and tell everybody on the earth. Spread the good news that there is no death, that one man has proved that life is eternal, that one man has come back from death, that one man has proved that death can be conquered.\nAnd if you become a witness,' he said to his disciples,'you will be able to persuade people not to live in sin, not to live in unconsciousness. Tell them to repent for whatsoever they have done in the past, to ask forgiveness for it. And tell them, because you have been a witness, that the impossible has become possible: death can be conquered, because death does not exist. Tell them that if they ask, they will be forgiven.'\nChristianity, the whole of Christianity depends on this simple sentence:'If you repent, you can be forgiven.' Christianity is unique in this sense. No other religion, particularly Indian religions, talk of repentance and forgiveness. They are more scientific, in fact, more technological. They say: You have done something wrong, you have to undo it. You have to do something good, you have to keep everything in balance. Nobody can forgive you; you have to change your life, your karmas, your actions.\nChristianity has a tremendously beautiful concept of forgiveness. Christianity says: If you ask to be forgiven from your deepest core, you will be forgiven.\nWhy? Is there somebody who can forgive you?, No, but if you ask in intense passion to be forgiven, the very idea of repentance becomes forgiveness. If you\nhave really asked, realized that you have done something wrong; if it has been a total realization and you accept the responsibility that it was wrong and that you are ready to repent for it, and you repent wholeheartedly, the very repentance becomes the forgiveness. Then there is no need to do anything else, because all sins are nothing but unconscious acts. Repentance makes you conscious, alert.\nSin is like darkness. You bring a light, a lamp into darkness and darkness disappears.\nSin is because you are asleep.\nIf you repent, you awake yourself. Because there is no other way to repent unless you awake yourself, unless you come to realize and see what you have been doing, how you have been living, how you have been wasting, how you have been hurting. When you come to realize it, a flame starts burning in you, an awareness; and in that awareness, in that light, darkness disappears. It is not that there is a God personified sitting somewhere on a throne in heaven who goes on forgiving you. There is nobody to forgive you. But if you repent, you will be forgiven.\nGod is not a person; God is the totality. God is existence, the totality of being. It is not that you have to pray to Him so that He can forgive, no. In your praying you are forgiven. The very prayer, the very recognition that you have been wrong and you recognize it and you repent, is enough. All that you have been up to then is, wiped, washed. You are cleansed of it. The old is gone, the new is born.\nThis is resurrection.\nAND THAT REPENTANCE AND REMISSION OF SINS SHOULD BE PREACHED IN HIS NAME AMONG ALL NATIONS, BEGINNING AT JERUSALEM.\nAND YE ARE WITNESSES OF THESE THINGS.\nAnd Jesus told them,'You have witnessed the greatest thing that has ever happened: the resurrection. Now go and spread the good news to those who were not fortunate enough to be here. Go to the housetops and tell everybody.'\nAnd those disciples went all over the earth. They carried authority. They had seen something which nobody had seen before them. In their eyes you could see the reflection of Jesus coming back from death. In each of their gestures you could feel the presence of Jesus: they had seen, they had become witnesses to something. They carried authority. They created a great movement; beginning in Jerusalem it spread all over the earth. It is just as you throw a pebble in a silent lake: it falls at a certain point and then ripples arise, and ripples go to the farthest shores.\nJesus is a whole art of inner transformation. I say art, I don't say science. When I talk on Patanjali, I can say that whatsoever Patanjali says is a science. When I talk on Buddha, I can say that whatsoever Buddha says is a psychology. But not with Jesus. He has given an art, because he has given love, not law. If you understand Jesus, by and by, you will become aware that it is not a question of following a certain rule. Rather, it is a question of following a quality of love. Love is the only thing that transcends death, because love is the only thing that life exists for.\nLove is the very center of being. If you love, all is forgiven. If you love, you have repented. If you love, one day or other you yourself will become a witness that there is no death.\nAccept Jesus' invitation. He is not going to take anything from you. He is going to take only that which you don't have, and he is going to give you life abundant, life eternal.\nBut don't be bothered about Christianity much. Jesus has been murdered twice.\nOnce he was murdered in Jerusalem by Jews, but they could not murder him. He survived. After the third day he resurrected. Then he was murdered in Rome, in the Vatican. And they murdered him more efficiently, of course, because they knew that this man had once come out of death. Jews crucified him not knowing that this man could come out of death, so they did not take all the precautions.\nChristians killed this man again with all the precautions, and Jesus has not been able to come out again.\nDon't be bothered about Christianity. Christianity has nothing to do with Christ. Jesus is available to all. Jesus is for those who are ready to transform\nthemselves; Jesus is an art of inner transformation, of rebirth. Listen to his invitation. He still goes on saying,'Come, follow me.'\nTable of Contents \u003c Previous | Contents\n","wordCount":"51468","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/come_follow_to_you__vol_4/part2/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/come_follow_to_you__vol_4/>Come Follow To You - Vol 4</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: He Is At Hand</h1><div class=post-meta>242 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;51468 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Come_Follow_To_You__Vol_4/part2.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part1>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a></p><h2 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=chapter-title-he-is-at-hand><span id=bookmark2>‌</span>Chapter

PRAY YONDER.</p><p>37 AND HE TOOK WITH HIM PETER AND THE TWO SONS OF ZEBEDEE, AND BEGAN
TO BE SORROWFUL AND VERY HEAVY.</p><p>38 THEN SAITH HE UNTO THEM: MY SOUL IS EXCEEDING SORROWFUL, EVEN UNTO
DEATH. TARRY YE HERE, AND WATCH WITH ME.</p><p>39 AND HE WENT A LITTLE FARTHER, AND FELL ON HIS FACE, AND</p><p>PRAYED, SAYING: O MY FATHER, IF IT BE POSSIBLE, LET THIS CUP PASS</p><p>FROM ME. NEVERTHELESS NOT AS I WILL, BUT AS THOU WILT. 40 AND HE
COMETH UNTO THE DISCIPLES, AND FINDETH THEM</p><p>ASLEEP, AND SAITH UNTO PETER: WHAT, COULD YE NOT WATCH WITH</p><p>ME ONE HOUR?</p><p>41 WATCH AND PRAY, THAT YE ENTER NOT INTO TEMPTATION. THE SPIRIT
INDEED IS WILLING, BUT THE FLESH IS WEAK.</p><p>42 HE WENT AWAY AGAIN THE SECOND TIME, AND PRAYED, SAYING: O</p><p>MY FATHER, IF THIS CUP MAY NOT PASS AWAY FROM ME, EXCEPT I DRINK IT,
THY WILL BE DONE.</p><p>43 AND HE CAME AND FOUND THEM ASLEEP AGAIN, FOR THEIR EYES</p><p>WERE HEAVY.</p><p>44 AND HE LEFT THEM, AND WENT AWAY AGAIN, AND PRAYED THE THIRD TIME,
SAYING THE SAME WORDS.</p><p>45 THEN COMETH HE TO HIS DISCIPLES, AND SAITH UNTO THEM: SLEEP</p><p>ON NOW, AND TAKE YOUR REST. BEHOLD, THE HOUR IS AT HAND, AND</p><p>THE SON OF MAN IS BETRAYED INTO THE HANDS OF SINNERS.</p><p>46 RISE, LET US BE GOING. BEHOLD, HE IS AT HAND THAT DOTH BETRAY</p><p>ME.</p><p>We are the hollow men We are the stuffed men Leaning together</p><p>Headpiece filled with straw. Alas! Our dried voices, when</p><p>We whisper together</p><p>Are quiet and meaningless As wind in dry grass</p><p>Or rats' feet over broken glass In our dry cellar.</p><p>Shape without form, shade without colour, Paralysed force, gesture
without motion; Those who have crossed</p><p>With direct eyes, to death's other Kingdom Remember us -- if at all
-- not as lost Violent souls, but only</p><p>As the hollow men The stuffed men.</p><p>THESE lines from T.S. Eliot are very significant, tremendously
meaningful. Man, in his ignorance, is just a negative emptiness; stuffed
with straw, hollow within.</p><p>Just observe yourself. What have you gained in life? You may have
lost much, but you have not gained anything. It is not only that your
hands are empty, your whole being is empty. And empty not in the
Buddhist sense: empty not in the sense of silence, empty not in the
sense of fullness of being; but empty because the consciousness is
lacking, empty because the awareness is missing. You are not a presence,
you are an absence -- hollow within, stuffed with straw. That straw may
be gold, it may be money; that straw may be power. A thousand and one
are the names of that straw, but it is straw because it does not nourish
the soul. It does not create the soul, it is destructive. At the most,
it gives you a feeling of fullness, a very deceptive feeling.</p><p>These are the two ways to live: either to attain to true emptiness, a
positive emptiness -- that is the way of meditation, prayer, the way
that moves, by and by, towards God; the other way is just to go on
stuffing yourself with useless, futile things, with no ultimate meaning
in them. At the most, for the moment they keep you occupied. But sooner
or later, one comeS to discover that one has missed the</p><p>opportunity.</p><p>When Woodrow Wilson became the President of America, the whole family
was celebrating. His friends all over the country were dancing in
happiness, he was crying and weeping in his room. The wife approached.
She could not believe her eyes because Woodrow Wilson was sitting on his
chair near the window, head leaning downwards, as sad as he had ever
been seen before, with tears rolling down. With deep love the wife asked
the husband,'What has happened? Why are you crying and weeping?'
Helooked up with sad eyes. He said,'Now that I have become the President
of the most powerful country, now that I have become the most powerful
man, I realize tremendously the whole absurdity of it. Nothing is
gained, and I have wasted my whole life. Now I understand the futility
of power, because sooner or later, death will be coming, and I am
powerless against it.'</p><p>And if your power is powerless against death, then it is just a
deception. Unless you attain to the deathless, your power is not power,
it is a false coin.</p><p>And who can attain power against death? -- one who attains to true
emptiness, positive emptiness. The other name for that emptiness is deep
inner fulfillment.</p><p>You are not filled with straw, but you are filled with your own
awareness. You are not filled with furniture: cars, houses, money, and
other nonsense. You are just filled with your being, the sheer am-ness,
the sheer existence. Then there is no death for you. This is the last
night of Jesus with his disciples, and it is very meaningful, because he
will not ever be seen again. I have told you before, and it will be good
to remember it again, to be reminded, that Jesus is a bridge. He is man
plus God. Buddha is sheer godliness; the man has disappeared
completely.</p><p>You cannot conceive of Buddha being sorrowful, you cannot conceive of
Buddha asking anything from God. Jesus is both; that is his paradox, and
his beauty. He is a bridge between these two distant phenomena: man and
God -- son of man and son of God. When Jesus is praying in these sutras,
his son-ship is praying to his own father-ship. Christians have missed
that point completely. It is not a prayer addressed to some God in
heaven; his own two polarities are in deep dialogue: Jesus as son of man
in deep dialogue, communion, with Jesus as son of God. This is an inner
phenomenon. Let me read you the sutra.</p><p>THEN COMETH JESUS WITH THEM UNTO A PLACE CALLED GETHSEMANE, AND SAITH
UNTO THE DISCIPLES: SIT YE HERE,</p><p>WHILE I GO AND PRAY YONDER.</p><p>These words:'Sit ye here', are exactly the meaning of what Zen people
call zazen.</p><p>Zazen means: just sitting, doing nothing. When Jesus said,'Sit ye
here,' he said to them:'You simply sit, don't do anything. Just remain
alert, silent -- a silent pool with no ripples of thought, just
sitting.' Zen people know the meaning of it, Christianity has completely
forgotten. In Christianity, the very idea of just sitting has
disappeared. Christian interpretations are there. They think Jesus is
simply telling them to sit there. When a man like Jesus speaks, his
words are not to be interpreted in an ordinary way. His language is not
ordinary. The words may be ordinary, but his meaning never is. He is
saying to his disciples,'Be in zazen.'</p><p>Let me explain to you what zazen is. Zazen is a deep unoccupiedness
-- not doing anything outwardly, not doing anything inwardly. It is not
even meditation because when you meditate you are making some sort of
effort, you are trying to do something: chanting a mantra, remembering
God, or even remembering yourself. But these efforts create ripples,
these efforts create vibrations and your sitting becomes corrupted. Then
your sitting is not innocent.</p><p>Zazen means: sit, and just sit, nothing else. There is no doing on
the part of the body, no doing on the part of the mind. It's a state of
non-doing. That does not mean that you are fast asleep, because sleep is
a doing. That does not mean that you are dead, because if you are dead
you cannot just sit. That simply means that you are tremendously alive,
intensely alive, a fire of being, but not moving anywhere -- a reservoir
of energy in a deep awaiting. You are just waiting for something to
happen, not even expecting, because expectation will again create a
ripple of thought and the mind will start functioning. Everything is
suspended.</p><p>You breathe, and that's all that you do. But that is not a doing,
because breathing goes on its own accord. You have not to do anything
but just sit silently.</p><p>It is said about Bodhidharma that he sat for nine years facing the
wall of his cave.</p><p>The story says that his legs withered away. Nine years sitting
silently, not doing anything: he was not chanting a mantra, he was not
remembering any God, he was not doing any prayer. He was just sitting,
facing a wall. His legs withered away. It is very significant, because
legs are symbolic of activity, of movement.</p><p>All movement disappeared. Whether his legs actually withered away or
not is not the point. The point is that all movement disappeared. The
consciousness became an unmoving reservoir of energy, just pure energy
not going anywhere.</p><p>Then came his first disciple, because he would not accept any
disciple unless he showed a tremendous intensity to follow. Hui Kujo
came. It is said that he cut off his hand and offered it to Bodhidharma,
and said,'Turn towards me, otherwise I will cut off my head.'</p><p>Bodhidharma had to turn. That was the first movement he had made in
nine years. He said,'Wait -- so the man has come to whom I can deliver
my message.'</p><p>Again it may or it may not be that the disciple offered his hand.
Again, it is a symbol: hands mean activity. Legs mean movement, hands
mean activity. With activity offered, only then is being revealed.
Bodhidharma gave his message, his all, to this man who had symbolically
shown that he was ready to lose activity.</p><p>When Jesus said to his disciples,'Sit ye here,' he meant zazen:
that,'You simply sit and wait, because a tremendous event is on the way.
Something is going to happen that I will never be repeated again in the
whole history of man.</p><p>Something unrepeatable, something unique is on the way. You wait,
sit, and watch. Don't make any movement, because even a slight movement
of thought, emotion, body, and you may miss the point. The son of man is
going to be delivered to God. The son of man is going to disappear, and
the son of God is going to appear. The greatest event ever is going to
happen: sit ye here.'</p><p>And the word 'here' is also very, very meaningful.'Sitting' shows:
don't move in space, and 'here' shows: don't move in time. Just be here,
now -- no movement in space, no movement in time. It would have been
easier for the disciples --</p><p>because it was late and they were tired of the whole day's
celebration, activities, and they would have liked to fall asleep -- it
would have been easier if they had been allowed to walk around. They
would have kept awake. But Jesus said,'Sit.</p><p>SIT HERE, don't walk around. Don't move in space and don't move in
time.'</p><p>The body moves in space; mind moves in time. Body is part of space,
mind is part of time. Jesus says,'Sit -- here.' By sitting, you stop the
movement in space; by being here, just being here, you stop the movement
of mind. This is the whole</p><p>meaning of zazen. If it can be rightly interpreted, Jesus said to his
disciples: Do zazen...</p><p>... WHILE L GO AND PRAY YONDER.</p><p>Jesus is going to pray; prayer is a bridge. The son is going to pray
to the Father; the lower is going to pray to the higher; the earth is
going to pray to the sky; the seed is going to pray to the tree, to the
future.</p><p>Prayer is love.</p><p>Jesus says,'I am going to offer myself to my God. Sit silently,
watchful, alert' -- as watchful as the beloved awaits the lover, as
alert. If anything moves, she suspects that maybe the lover has come;
these may be the footsteps of the lover.… She runs to the door. It may
be just a wind passing by, it may be just wind playing with the dry
leaves on the street, it may be just a beggar, it may be just a
stranger, but a beloved remains alert, watchful, waiting --
passionately, intensely focused.</p><p>Jesus says,'Watch ye, sit here. I am going to pray.'</p><p>When a man like Jesus prays, God answers. If your prayers have not
been answered, don't complain. It simply shows that you have not prayed.
If your prayers have not been answered, it simply shows that you have
done something else, not prayer. Prayer is a total, unconditional
offering, saying,'I am yours. Thy will be done.' Jesus is going to pray.
When Jesus goes to pray, the earth is going to meet the sky. If the
disciples can be silently watchful, they will become witnesses to the
greatest event, to a tremendous event: the sky coming down to meet the
earth, the God descending to meet the son. A great phenomenon within
Jesus' heart is going to happen: the polarities are going to become one,
the opposites are going to meet. Rightly he said to his disciples,'Sit
ye here while I go and pray yonder.'</p><p>One more thing, and then we can move on.</p><p>A meditation is just sitting. A meditation is just being where you
are. Prayer is a going, meditation is a sitting. In prayer you extend
your being. In prayer you rise like high waves in the ocean to touch the
beyond. In meditation you simply wait.</p><p>Meditation is passive, prayer is not; prayer is active. In
meditation, you simply</p><p>open the doors of your heart and you wait. In prayer that is not
enough -- you open the doors and you run towards the height. That's why
Jesus says,'While I GO and pray yonder. You meditate while I pray.'</p><p>When a Master is praying, if the disciples can simply wait and
meditate, much will happen to them. Because, when the love of the whole
descends on the Master, it will naturally shower on the disciples also.
Only a Master can pray; a disciple can only meditate. Because prayer is
possible when you have known what God is. Prayer is possible when you
have known the whole. Meditation is possible without knowing anything
about God. In fact, for meditation, God is not needed. That's why the
religions which are based on meditation are atheistic: Jainism and
Buddhism are both atheistic; they don't believe in any God. There is no
need. They are meditative religions: they simply sit and wait. Whenever
they are ready, God comes. The religions of prayer: Christianity,
Hinduism, Islam, don't just sit, they RUN towards God. They move. You
can think of Buddhism or Jainism as a silent ocean with no ripples, no
waves. You can think of Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, as the ocean in
high tide -- great waves rising to meet the sky.</p><p>Prayer is different from meditation: meditation is passivity, prayer
is activity.</p><p>That's why Buddhism and Jainism teach renunciation, moving away from
activity. Christianity teaches service, moving into the marketplace,
going to seek and search God. But only a Master can pray, because love
is possible only when you know the other. How can you call God? -- you
don't know. How can you call Him 'thou'? -- you don't know. At the most,
He remains a hypothesis, and a hypothesis cannot be called 'thou'. At
the most it will remain 'it'; it can never become a 'thou'. It can be
used, but cannot be loved. Nobody can love a mathematical theorem.
Nobody can love the greatest formula there is, the Einsteinian formula:
E = MC2. How can you love it? How can you call this formula 'thou'? How
can you bow down before it? How can tears go on flowing from your eyes;
how can you dance around it? Maybe the formula is very great, explains
much, but an explanation cannot be worshipped. God, when known, is
touched as you touch your beloved, kissed as you kiss your beloved,
looked deep into the eyes of as you look deep into the eyes of your
beloved. Unless God comes to you like a lover, prayer is not possible.
Your prayer will be false.</p><p>But a Master can pray. When he is praying the sky descends over him,
surrounds him, touches him from all over, from all dimensions. And if
the disciples are just</p><p>there, sitting silently in deep zazen, meditating, their hearts will
be thrilled. The unknown will touch them also, the unknown will
penetrate their beings also.</p><p>Because when it rains, when God rains, it does not rain like a miser.
When God rains, it rains tremendously; it fills the whole earth. Even
one Jesus prays, and God rains and fills the whole earth. Wherever
people are waiting silently, meditating, suddenly they will be full of
Him. Then prayer becomes possible, not before it. A real touch is
needed, a contact is needed. God has to be touched, one has to be
touched by God; only then, trust arises.</p><p>Meditation does not need God. You can discard the hypothesis and
meditate. If you go on meditating, then one day God will fill your
heart. But if you have a Master who can pray on your behalf, who can
pray for you, who can simply pray, you will gain much of which you were
not yet worthy.</p><p>It is the last night, Jesus is going to leave the next day. He would
like to give them a gift, a gift of God. He said to them,'Sit ye here
while I go and pray yonder.' He wants to go into deep isolation, alone,
because even the presence of the disciples can be a disturbance.
Meditation can be done in a group. Prayer is such an intimate
phenomenon; it is a meeting of two lovers. Nobody should be a witness to
it, nobody should be a bystander to it, nobody should observe it.</p><p>Otherwise, the very fact that somebody is there will become a jarring
note. Prayer is always in the alone.</p><p>And look at the foolishness: people meditate alone, and pray
together.</p><p>Meditators move into loneliness, and when you want to pray you go to
the church, you go to the temple and you pray together. Prayer has to be
in absolute aloneness, because prayer is love. Meditation can be done in
a group: it is a technique. In fact, if you meditate in a group, you
will meditate deeply because the group helps, enhances. It fosters
confidence. A group mind is created, a great wave of group consciousness
is created and you simply move on the wave.</p><p>But to pray is to love. One should pray as one loves. You cannot make
love in a marketplace. In the West it is happening, and because of it
love is losing all meaning. It needs privacy, it needs intimacy. In the
West now, love has become a public affair. In a public garden you can
find lovers in deep embrace, even making love publicly. This is profane;
something sacred is being destroyed.</p><p>Something very intimate is being made public, corrupted. The
innocence will be lost.</p><p>Love needs intimacy, love needs darkness. In fact, love needs so much
aloneness that women always close their eyes while love is made to them.
Even the presence of the lover, to see the lover, is a disturbance. They
close their eyes, they are totally alone. Even the lover is not to be
seen, otherwise the other will be there, and the presence of the other
is always a tension. When the other is completely forgotten, when deep
in darkness the other is lost, then love arises to its highest peak, to
the greatest orgasm.</p><p>Remember this: Jesus was trying to give them his last gift; but the
gift was invisible, and the gift was such that nothing could be said
about it. Only those who were capable would receive it, and those who
were not capable would miss it.</p><p>THEN COMETH JESUS WITH THEM UNTO A PLACE CALLED</p><p>GETHSEMANE, AND SAITH UNTO THE DISCIPLES: SIT YE HERE, WHILE I GO AND
PRAY YONDER. AND HE TOOK WITH HIM PETER AND THE TWO</p><p>SONS OF ZEBEDEE, AND BEGAN TO BE SORROWFUL AND VERY HEAVY.</p><p>Three disciples he took with him. These three disciples were as if
they were not.</p><p>They had lost their egos; they could be allowed to be there. Their
presence would not be a jarring note because they had no presence of
their own. They were like shadows of Jesus, part of his being.</p><p>... AND BEGAN TO BE SORROWFUL AND VERY HEAVY.</p><p>This is the beauty of Jesus, that he can be sorrowful. A Buddha
cannot be. Jesus is more flowing; he can comprehend the opposites.</p><p>I have heard about one great Zen Master, Lin Chi. Somebody asked,'You
have become enlightened. Tell us something: what has happened to you
after enlightenment?'</p><p>He laughed and he said,'I was miserable before enlightenment.
Enlightenment has happened, and I am miserable yet.'</p><p>It is very difficult to understand what he means to say. He is saying
that enlightenment is not going to destroy the polarity. Rather, on the
contrary, enlightenment is going to create a higher synthesis of the
paradox, of the polarity. It is not that an enlightened man does not
become sad, but that he becomes sad in a different way. His sadness has
a totally different quality to it.</p><p>His sadness is happier than your happiness. His sadness has a depth,
his sadness has a beauty -- a silent song without any sounds.</p><p>... AND BEGAN TO BE SORROWFUL AND VERY HEAVY.</p><p>This is the son of man who began to be sorrowful, because soon this
shore had to be left. The ship had arrived, and no more would he be
here. But why is he sorrowful? -- because he is son of man, he belongs
to this earth also. He is not only the sky. He would have to leave this
earth, and he had loved this earth also, he had loved this body also.
His love was great enough to comprehend all. He had enjoyed a thousand
and one enjoyments. He delighted here; he was not an ascetic. He was
celebrating life here; and now, no more of that celebration, no more of
that delight. No more would he again be able to sing that song of the
earth. Jesus was a very earth-rooted man.</p><p>THEN SAITH HE UNTO THEM: MY SOUL IS EXCEEDING SORROWFUL, EVEN UNTO
DEATH. TARRY YE HERE, AND WATCH WITH ME.</p><p>To these three disciples he said,'My soul is exceedingly sorrowful,
my cup of sorrow is overflowing.' He is like a river that is going to
fall into the ocean. The river hesitates; it looks backwards -- all
those beautiful terrains, those beautiful Himalayas far off, those
glaciers, those peaks: the trees, the forest, the banks, the people --
millions of experiences. Now, within a minute, everything would be
ended. The river wants to linger a little on the verge before falling
into the ocean and disappearing. The river hesitates. The speed slows
down; it looks backwards, full of nostalgia. This is what was happening
to Jesus. He had lived, and he lived profoundly. His true life has not
been said, because Christians are afraid. They have made an ascetic out
of him. He was not. He loved eating, he loved wine, he loved women; he
loved the small joys of life. He was a man very much of this earth,
plus. The earth was not denied, the earth was made holy in</p><p>him. The earth was not rejected, the earth was celebrated as a gift
of God.</p><p>Buddha is different. He would not look when his river was going to
fall, he would not look backwards. In fact, his speed would be
increased: this is the ocean for which he had been waiting and longing.
He would really jump into the ocean. He would not even give a 'thank
you' to the earth.</p><p>Jesus is different; their personalities are different. And it is good
that life produces different types of buddhas. Life is richer for it --
so many types of flowers with such different fragrances. Life is not
monotonous. Life does not produce buddhas as a Ford factory produces
Ford cars. Each buddha is unique.</p><p>Buddha has his own beauty, the beauty of the sky. Epicurus has his
own beauty, the beauty of the earth. And Jesus is something: Epicurus
plus Buddha -- the beauty of this earth and of that sky -- a great
synthesis, an infinite harmony.</p><p>MY SOUL IS EXCEEDING SORROWFUL, -- EVEN UNTO DEATH. TARRY YE</p><p>HERE, AND WATCH WITH ME.</p><p>He had left the other disciples a little behind. He told them to sit
quietly, to be in zazen, to meditate. He had brought the closest ones
near him, and he said to them,'Tarry ye here, and watch with me' -- move
around near me, and be watchful. Why this difference? Why could he not
bring all of the disciples close?</p><p>Only those can be allowed to be very close who have almost
disappeared. They will not be a disturbance.'Tarry ye here, and watch
with me' -- something tremendous is on the way; be watchful.</p><p>AND HE WENT A LITTLE FARTHER, AND FELL ON HIS FACE... the earth</p><p>that he loved too much. He fell on the earth... AND PRAYED, SAYING: O
MY FATHER, IF IT BE POSSIBLE, LET THIS CUP PASS FROM ME.</p><p>This is the son of man, the helpless man, the helpless earth, the
earth speaking to the sky,'Oh Father, if it be possible, let this cup
pass from me.' Jesus would have liked to live a little longer. Jesus
would not have liked to leave this earth so soon; he loved it.</p><p>NEVERTHELESS, NOT AS I WILL, BUT AS THOU WILT.</p><p>These two trends are continuously in him. The earth part says,'If it
be possible, oh my God, oh my Father, let this cup pass from me. Don't
force me to fall into the ocean so soon.' But the other part, the son of
God, the other polarity of his being, says,'Nevertheless, not as I will,
but as thou wilt.'</p><p>AND HE COMETH UNTO THE DISCIPLES AND FINDETH THEM ASLEEP, AND SAITH
UNTO PETER: WHAT, COULD YE NOT WATCH WITH ME ONE</p><p>HOUR? -- because when he prayed, the earth and the sky met. When he
prayed, the son and the God met. When he prayed, a great symphony arose
within him where the son of man was no more separate from the son of
God. His body and soul danced together in a mysterious harmony.</p><p>AND HE COMETH UNTO THE DISCIPLES AND FINDETH THEM ASLEEP...</p><p>They missed.</p><p>There are gifts which cannot be given to you until you are ready to
receive them.</p><p>There are gifts which can be given to you whether you are ready to
receive them or not, and those are the gifts of the world. There are
gifts which can be given to you only when you are ready to receive them
-- those are the gifts of the invisible, of the other world, of the
other shore. Jesus created a situation, but the disciples missed.</p><p>... AND FINDETH THEM ASLEEP, AND SAITH UNTO PETER: WHAT,</p><p>COULD YE NOT WATCH WITH ME ONE HOUR? -- is sleep that important?</p><p>Could you not remain alert and aware for only one hour? WATCH AND
PRAY, THAT YE ENTER NOT INTO TEMPTATION. THE SPIRIT INDEED IS</p><p>WILLING, BUT THE FLESH IS WEAK. He said to them again... the
compassion of a Master is infinite! You go on missing, and he goes on
giving to you.</p><p>WATCH AND PRAY, THAT YE ENTER NOT INTO TEMPTATION. THE</p><p>SPIRIT INDEED IS WILLING, BUT THE FLESH IS WEAK. Deep down, who</p><p>is not willing? But on the surface is the problem. Deep down, you
would like to attain to truth, but the surface, the flesh, is
unwilling.</p><p>HE WENT AWAY AGAIN THE SECOND TIME, AND PRAYED, SAYING: O</p><p>MY FATHER, IF THIS CUP MAY NOT PASS AWAY FROM ME, EXCEPT I DRINK IT,
THY WILL BE DONE.</p><p>Again he said the same prayer. Why did Jesus repeat these prayers? It
was not for himself. For himself, once was enough. Twice, thrice he
repeated them, for the disciples. He was trying to transfer the key. He
was ready to give them the greatest science, the science of how to get
out of their imprisonments. But they wouldn't listen, they wouldn't
understand. They thought,'One hour's sleep is far better than being
alert.'</p><p>And remember, this is the case with you, and with everybody. You can
miss a meditation just because in the morning you are feeling a little
too lazy and too sleepy. And who knows? -- that meditation could have
been a conversion.</p><p>Nobody knows. You may have missed something, and you will never
become aware that you missed. Your sleep is really deep. You live an
almost unconscious life.</p><p>I will tell you one story I was reading.</p><p>A lion was captured and placed in a large yard surrounded by a high
fence. He soon became acquainted with the social life of the other lions
who had been there a long time. The lions had divided themselves into
several clubs: political, religious, and others, each with its own
activities, philosophies, dogmas, scriptures, ideologies. One group met
regularly to hate and slander the captors, that was their whole activity
-- as if just by hating and slandering the captors something was going
to happen. Another group met to sing sentimentally about a future jungle
having no fences. They must have been utopian, imaginary people who live
in fantasy. They depicted a future jungle with no fences, in beautiful
colors, and they sang about it in as beautiful poetry as possible. They
must have been very romantic, utopian, imaginary people. And a third
group met to secretly plan violence against the other groups, to plot
violence against the</p><p>other groups. Those were the conspirators; they were not so much
against the captors as they were against the other groups of lions.</p><p>Each club tried to pressure the newcomer into joining, but something
held him back. His hesitation was caused by observing one particular
lion who kept to himself, and who seemed always to be in deep thought
and meditation. And this lion who used to be alone, a loner, attracted
the newcomer. He had some quality of magnetism around him: a certain
power, a certain magic. The newcomer shyly approached the solitary lion
and requested an explanation of his apartness. The very apartness must
have given him a quality of charisma, a glow around him.</p><p>Because people who live in crowds lose their individuality and their
charisma; people who live alone always gather around them an aura of
authority, of majesty. This loner looked like a king. He had something
of the imperial in him.</p><p>'Join nothing!' replied the lion, the meditator.'These foolish
creatures do everything but the necessary. I am doing what is essential,
so one day I will be out of here. You are welcome to all the facts I
have uncovered.'</p><p>'But what is this necessary thing that you are doing?' asked the
newcomer.</p><p>'Listen carefully,' said the loner, the meditator lion.'I am studying
the nature of the fence. That is the only essential thing to do in life:
to understand the nature of the fence.'</p><p>Where is your fence? Where are the walls of your prison? -- in your
sleep, in your unconsciousness, in your behavior like a robot's. That's
what Jesus was trying to show his disciples that night:'If you can be
alert, you will be free.' Awareness is freedom, sleepiness is bondage.
But even on that last night, the night of departure -- and these
disciples will repent for centuries, and in their repentance they will
worship Jesus, and they will create millions of churches for him -- when
he was alive and he was departing, they were not even able to do that
much for his sake: to be alert and watchful for a few hours.</p><p>AND HE CAME AND FOUND THEM ASLEEP AGAIN, FOR THEIR EYES WERE HEAVY.
AND HE LEFT THEM., AND WENT AWAY AGAIN, AND PRAYED THE THIRD TIME,
SAYING THE SAME WORDS.</p><p>Why did he do it the third time? He didn't wake them the third time;
the compassion of a Master is infinite. He understood that it was
impossible for them to be awake, so he tried to pray:'Let it be so, that
they are fast asleep. But if God showers, even in their unconsciousness
some seed may fall, even in their sleep they may hear something. Even
fast asleep they may come to know something that they are unaware of;
they may carry some quality.' Much would have been possible if they had
been aware and alert, but that seemed impossible. He had tried twice.
The hours were passing fast; soon he would be betrayed, caught and
killed:'No time is to be lost. Let them sleep.'</p><p>Many times, the same happens: here, I go on looking into your faces;
you seem to be listening to me, but you rarely listen. You are more or
less asleep. But I go on; I go on calling you, provoking you. Maybe even
if a word falls deep down into you, even while you are asleep, that seed
will some -- day bring fruit. Much would have been possible, much was
available, but you were not present.</p><p>Just the other day I was telling you that Buddha gave his flower to
Mahakashyap, Jesus gave bread and wine to his disciples. And I told you
that Buddha chose a flower because a flower is the most unearthly thing
on the earth.</p><p>So elusive is the beauty of the flower. In the morning it is there;
by the evening, gone. It looks like a dream; it does not look material.
It can be crushed, destroyed so easily; it gives no resistance. How it
exists is a miracle. A rose flower -- how does it exist in this world of
stones and rocks? It is a miracle; it is something from the beyond.
Buddha chose the flower. Jesus chooses bread -- very ordinary, common;
and wine, even more earthly. It is good, because he loved the earth. But
there is one thing that I must tell you: when Buddha gave the flower to
Mahakashyap, the flower was received in perfect awareness. When Buddha
gave the flower, Mahakashyap was totally alert and aware. But when Jesus
gave the bread and the wine, to whom did he give them? They were not
like Mahakashyap; they were not so aware. It was given to them out of
Jesus'</p><p>compassion. When Buddha gave to Mahakashyap, Mahakashyap had earned
it; it was not simply out of Buddha's compassion. Of course the
compassion was there, but Mahakashyap had earned it. He was ready to
receive it.</p><p>In Jesus' case, there is only compassion, pure compassion. Those
disciples were not yet ready. But the time had come for Jesus to leave;
he gave them something they would become aware of only after many lives.
He gave them the key to a</p><p>treasure. They might not open it for lives, but the key would remain
with them in their unconscious. Some day, whenever they become alert,
they will be able to use the key.</p><p>It is said by Zen people that whatsoever was given to Mahakashyap was
beyond scripture, beyond words, beyond knowledge. Let it be said about
Jesus also: that whatsoever he gave was not only beyond scripture and
beyond words, it was also beyond consciousness. He gave to them in their
unconsciousness. They were asleep, and his time had come. He simply gave
the key, closed their fists, and withdrew to his eternal home. Some day,
whenever their morning comes and they open their eyes, they will find
the key in their hands.</p><p>AND HE LEFT THEM, AND WENT AWAY AGAIN, AND PRAYED THE THIRD TIME,
SAYING THE SAME WORDS. THEN COMETH HE TO HIS DISCIPLES, AND SAITH UNTO
THEM: SLEEP ON NOW -- now you can</p><p>sleep as much as you like, because the moment has been missed. Now
you</p><p>cannot miss anything by sleeping -- AND TAKE YOUR REST. BEHOLD, THE
HOUR IS AT</p><p>HAND, AND THE SON OF MAN IS BETRAYED INTO THE HANDS OF</p><p>SINNERS. RISE, LET US BE GOING. BEHOLD, HE IS AT HAND THAT DOTH</p><p>BETRAY ME.</p><p>The crowd was approaching with Judas leading it. In the dark night
their footsteps could be heard, their torches could be seen. And Jesus
said -- he must have said it in deep sadness -- 'Sleep on now, take your
rest'; because one who was disturbing your sleep now has to be moving.
The one who was trying to disturb your dreams, and your sleep, and your
rest, has been betrayed, and the enemy is approaching.'RISE, LET US BE
GOING. BEHOLD, HE IS AT HAND</p><p>THAT DOTH BETRAY ME.'</p><p>This sentence is very pregnant. Jesus could have waited there; the
enemy was approaching. But the story says that he walked towards the
enemy to meet them.</p><p>It is symbolic of one who knows that death is not going to destroy.
It is also symbolic of one who welcomes death, who goes to meet it. It
is symbolic that Jesus accepts whatsoever is God's will. He has
surrendered. The earth has surrendered to the sky; the body has

title: Happiness is that which Happens 26 December 1975 am in Buddha
Hall</h3><p>The first question:</p><p>Question 1</p><p>OSHO: L DON'T WANT TO BE THIS, I DON'T WANT TO BE THAT; I DON'T</p><p>WANT TO BE HERE, I DON'T WANT TO BE THERE; I DON'T WANT TO LIVE, I
DON'T WANT TO DIE; I DON'T WANT TO CRY, I DON'T WANT TO</p><p>LAUGH; I CAN'T BE PASSIVE, I CAN'T BE ACTIVE; I CAN'T WILL AND I
CAN'T SURRENDER.</p><p>SO then just be in between.</p><p>And this is not a question of one person, this is the state of all
minds. The mind cannot be this and cannot be that. The mind does not
want to be defined, does not want to be static, does not want to be
confined; so whenever you want to try to be this, the mind starts
working to be that. It goes on moving in the polarities.</p><p>Mind is a movement; it is a constant movement.</p><p>So what can be done? -- don't try to be this or that; just be in
between. If you can be in between, you transcend mind. Just watch, be a
witness. Don't to to do anything; just observe mind going from A to B,
from B to A again; mind moving from one side to the other like a
pendulum of an old clock: from left to right, from right to left.</p><p>Have you watched a pendulum? When it is going to the left, it is
gathering momentum to go to the right. On the surface it is going to the
left; deep inside, it is gathering momentum to go to the opposite pole.
When it is going to the right it is being prepared to go to the
left.</p><p>When you love a person through the mind, you are already getting
ready to hate him. There is a poem by D. H. Lawrence in which he
says,'The moment I say to my beloved'I love you', I have already started
hating her. The moment I say to my beloved'I will be forever and forever
with you', I have already departed.' The divorce is on the way. In the
very moment you are getting married, divorce is on the way.</p><p>This is the way of the mind, how the mind functions. Just try to
understand the functioning of the mind, otherwise you will always be in
chaos, confusion, in a sort of insanity. Become a watcher. Get out of
the traffic of the mind, stand by the side of the road and just see. And
when I say just see, I mean don't evaluate, don't judge. Don't say,'This
is good, that is wrong.' Once you say,'This is good,'</p><p>you are no more a witness: you have jumped into the river; you are
already identified, you are already in trouble. Just stand by the side
of the road, or, sit on the bank of a river and let the river flow
wherever it goes. You are not concerned; it is none of your business.
Unconcerned, indifferent, just watching, you will suddenly be in
between: neither this nor that. That in between point is the point of
transcendence. Suddenly, the mind disappears with all its traffic. You
are left alone, alone in tremendous purity, alone in absolute innocence,
alone with no movement -- silent, eternal -- not going anywhere, just
being here. You are not trying to become someone, something, this or
that -- just being yourself. And to be yourself is to be divine. To be
yourself is to meditate. To be yourself is all that religion is about.
This is what I'm teaching here.</p><p>I'm not teaching you a particular pattern of life. I'm not giving you
a style of life. At the most, I'm trying to give you a vision, a
clarity, an understanding. I'm not</p><p>trying to give you a character: moral or immoral, good or bad. I'm
not giving you a philosophy to live by, I'm simply giving you an insight
into yourself. Then, no philosophy is needed, no pattern is needed.
Then, you can just be yourself with no condemnation, with no evaluation.
And that purity of being oneself, that beauty of being oneself
transcends all that you can desire, transcends all that you can even
conceive of, transcends all that you can eve imagine or dream about.</p><p>Just a glimpse of it, and you will never be the same again.</p><p>So, this is not a question from somebody in particular. Krishna Radha
has asked it, but it is not only her question; it is everybody's
question. It is one of the most basic, essential questions of all human
beings, of all those who are trapped in the mind. And there is only one
way out of the trap: that you don't choose; neither this nor that -- you
simply don't choose. You withdraw from choice and you become choiceless.
Choicelessness is freedom. To choose is to choose a prison; to choose is
to choose a bondage. To choose is wrong, to be choiceless is to be
right.</p><p>The second question:</p><p>Question 2</p><p>HOW IS IT POSSIBLE? -- I'M AFRAID WHEN I FEEL YOUR LOVE DEEP INSIDE
ME.</p><p>Love always creates fear because love is death, a greater death than
the ordinary death you know of.</p><p>In an ordinary death the body dies, but that is not death at all.
Body is just like a dress: when it is tatty and old you change for a new
one. It is not death, it is just a change: a change of a dress, or a
change of a house or abode. But you continue, the mind continues -- just
the same old mind in new bodies, just the same old wine in new bottles.
The form changes but not the mind, the shape changes but not the mind.
So the ordinary death is not a real death; love is a real death: the
body does not die but the mind dies, the body continues to be the same
but the ego disappears.</p><p>If you love, you will have to drop all the conceptions that you have
about yourself. If you love, you CANNOT be the ego because the ego will
not allow</p><p>love. They are antagonistic. If you choose the ego you will not be
able to choose love. If you choose love you will have to drop the ego.
Hence, the fear.</p><p>A greater fear than death grips you whenever you are in love. That's
why love has disappeared from the world. Rarely, very rarely does the
phenomenon happen that love descends. What you call love is just a false
coin: you have invented it because it is so difficult to live without
love. It is difficult because without love, life carries no meaning; it
is meaningless. Without love, life has no poetry in it. Without love,
the tree exists but never flowers. Without love, you cannot dance, you
cannot celebrate, you cannot feel grateful, you cannot pray.</p><p>Without love, temples are just ordinary houses; with love an ordinary
house is transformed, transfigured into a temple. Without love you
remain just possibilities -- empty gestures. With love, for the first
time you become substantial. With love, for the first time, the soul
arises in you. The ego drops but the soul arises.</p><p>It is impossible to live without love, so humanity has created a
trick. Humanity has invented a trick, a device. The device is: to live
in a false love so that the ego continues on its own. Nothing is changed
and you can play the game of being in love: you can go on thinking that
you love, you can go on believing that you love. But look at your love
-- what happens out of it? -- nothing except misery, nothing except
hell, nothing except conflict, quarrel, violence. Look deeply into your
love relationships. They are more akin to hate relationships than to
love.It is better to call them hate relationships than to call them love
relationships. But because everybody is living in the same way, you
never become aware.</p><p>Everybody is carrying the false coin; you never become aware. The
real coin of love is Very costly: you can purchase it only at the cost
of losing yourself. There is no other way.</p><p>So the question is perfectly relevant. It is from one that I know. I
know her love towards me, I know her deep possibilities. She is just on
the brink. Any moment the ego can collapse, but she is somehow holding
herself together. She will not be able to for long though; she will have
to collapse. Hence, the fear.</p><p>'How is it possible?' she asks.'I'm afraid when I feel your love deep
inside me.' She thinks it is a sort of contradiction: if she loves so
much, then why this fear?</p><p>And I tell you, the fear is there because she loves so much. There is
no contradiction in it. It is an absolutely consistent thing -- whenever
you love you are afraid. Moving towards love is moving towards an abyss.
One starts wavering, one feels dizzy. Go to a height in the Himalayas
and look down at the valley; that valley is no-thing. When you look down
at the valley of love, a TREMENDOUS fear grips you. You are almost
paralyzed: you cannot run away, you cannot take the jump. You simply
tremble in infinite fear. What to do? Going back is not possible because
love attracts: love calls your depth, love calls your future, love calls
your potentiality; love gives you a glimpse of what you can be.</p><p>You cannot run away from it, and you cannot jump because the cost is
too high. You will have to drop yourself -- all that you have been
thinking yourself to be -- the image, the past, the identity.</p><p>But I tell you, the cost only seems to be too much BEFORE the jump.
Once you take the jump... then you will know that whatsoever you have
given up is nothing, and what you have attained is INFINITELY valuable.
Let me tell you a paradox: love demands that you drop that which you
don't have, and love offers you that which you already have. Love wants
you to get rid of that which you don't have.</p><p>The ego is a false entity, just a notion, a cloud in the sky of your
being; just smoke, nothing substantial; a dream. Love requires you to
drop that which you don't have, and love is ready to give you that which
you have and have always had. Love gives you your self back; the ego
goes on hiding you from your self, love reveals you to your self. But
the fear is there. The fear is natural, and one has to go in spite of
the fear.</p><p>Be courageous, don't be cowards. The real mettle of your being is
tested only when love arises. Never before it do you know of what mettle
you are made. In ordinary life, in the marketplace, doing this and that,
in the world of ambition and power politics, your real mettle is never
really tested. You never pass through the fire.</p><p>Love is the fire.</p><p>If you are really gold you will survive it. If you are not real gold,
you will be</p><p>gone. But I tell you that you are real gold.</p><p>Trust me -- pass through the fire. Hesitation is natural, but don't
make hesitation a barrier. Even with the hesitation, pass through it. In
spite of the fear pass through the fire. And only through the fire will
the rose of your consciousness flower. There is no other way.</p><p>The third question:</p><p>Question 3</p><p>IT SEEMS THAT NOTHING EVER REALLY DROPS AWAY. SUDDENLY IT IS</p><p>GONE, BUT JUST AS SUDDENLY IT IS BACK AGAIN. IT ALL SEEMS LIKE A
MAGIC TRICK.</p><p>... A very meaningful question, with tremendous implications for
understanding. Let us move into it very slowly.</p><p>Yes, this is so: nothing ever really drops away. Nothing ever really
drops away; suddenly it is gone, and as suddenly as it left, in the same
way, at any moment, suddenly it is back again. Why is it so? -- because
you have never tried to understand the nature of human consciousness.
The nature of human consciousness is absolute freedom. When I say
absolute freedom, I mean you are free at any moment to be whatsoever you
decide. Nothing holds itself against you. You may have been a saint up
to now. You may have lived in celibacy up to now. This very moment you
can change: you can throw away your celibacy i you can fall in love with
a woman or a man. Because you have been celibate in the past does not,
CANNOT become a bondage. You remain free. If you want to be celibate in
this moment also, you can be. But remember that it is not because of the
past, it is again a fresh decision. You have to go on making your
decision again and again and again, reviving it again and again and
again. At any moment you can drop it.</p><p>Existentialists are true. They say: existence precedes essence. It is
a very pregnant sentence. Let me repeat it: existence precedes
essence.</p><p>A man is born; he is pure freedom. He has no essence, only existence.
Then he</p><p>will choose his essence, whom he is going to be -- and it will be his
choice. He can be a saint, he can be a sinner; he can be a criminal, he
can be a murderer, or he can ke a martyr. He brings pure existence into
the world -- a blank sheet, a pure canvas. What colors he is going to
use, and what sort of painting he is going to make of his life, is
totally up to him. He does not bring a character. He simply brings a
potentiality, pure potentiality. And this pure potentiality always
remains pure; you cannot corrupt it. You become a saint: that means you
decide that to be a saint is going to be your essence. But this is your
decision, and if you want to keep it up to the very end of your life,
every morning, in fact, every minute of your existence, you will have to
decide again and again and vote for it.</p><p>Any moment you stop deciding, any moment you say,'Enough is enough,
now I want to change,' nobody is barring the path. You can cancel your
whole past in a single moment, because that past was your decision,
nobody else's. It is not like a destiny forced from above, from outside.
It is your own inner decision. You can change it.</p><p>That's why nothing ever disappears. You can become a sinner, but
tomorrow you may again change. You can again take the vow of a Catholic
priest and become a priest again, become celibate. Try to understand
this.. This has tremendous implications for your life.</p><p>Don't throw the responsibility on anybody else. Nobody else is a
deciding factor, neither your mother nor your father. Whatsoever the
psychoanalysts say is really irrelevant to your being. It is for you to
decide. Even the people who are mad are mad because of their own
decision. Somehow they found it to be convenient.</p><p>Somehow they decided; they voted for it. Nobody has forced them.
Nobody can force anybody because the innermost quality of being is
freedom. It is not something accidental; it is your very nature.</p><p>You have been smoking up to now. For thirty years you may have been a
chain smoker and you come to me and you ask,'What to do? How to stop?'
You are asking a wrong question. In fact, you don't want to stop. Go
deep into your own mind: you don't want to stop; you are playing a game.
You don't want to stop but you want to;show people that you want to
stop. Or, this very idea that you want to stop gives you a very, very
good image about yourself. Then you go on saying,'What can I do? It has
become such a long habit; I cannot stop, though I want to stop.' This is
simple, sheer foolishness and stupidity. You are not</p><p>deceiving anybody except yourself. If you really want to Stop, there
is no need to do anything about it. The very decision that you want to
stop is enough: the half-smoked cigarette in your hand will drop of its
own accord. But you remain free.</p><p>That does not mean that again tomorrow you cannot take it up. You
remain free; nobody can bind you. Again tomorrow you can take it up.
Then please, don't start saying that it is because of old habit:'I tried
my best, and I had stopped, and for twenty-four hours I didn't smoke.
But because of a thirty-year-old habit, I am again taking it up. The
urge is too much.'</p><p>Do not try to befool anybody. There is nothing like that; you are
again deciding.</p><p>If you are deciding, then it is okay. You can find a thousand and one
ways to decide again. But remember always, it is your decision, yours
and nobody else's; and you remain free. That's why it happens that
nothing seems to disappear forever. It comes again and again -- because
you again invoke it to come, you again call it to come. I have heard:
Mulla Nasrudin had once decided that he would never touch any alcoholic
thing again in his life any intoxicant. And he was a drunkard. So just
to test his own will-power, he walked on the path where the pub was.
Just in front of the pub, he looked at the pub in avery proud way and
said to himself,'I have decided that nothing can attract me and nothing
can force me to g astray'; and he heartily walked a hundred feet away.
Then he patted his own back and he said,'Nasrudin, you are great. Now I
will treat you, come to the pub.' And on that day he drank twice.</p><p>Don't play games with yourself. It is your freedom, but freedom is
very dangerous because it does not leave any corner for you to hide in.
You cannot throw responsibility on anybody else. Simply and absolutely,
you are responsible. Just watch and see the fact of it, and truth
liberates.</p><p>If you can see this, then whether you decide to smoke or drink does
not matter.</p><p>Whether you decide to drop it does not matter. The only thing that
matters is to be always mindful of your freedom. If you are not aware of
that then this will happen: you will feel that nothing ever really drops
away. It comes again and again, and of course it comes worse than ever.
It comes with a vengeance.</p><p>But don't think of yourself as a victim; you are not. Try what I am
saying, just watch what I am saying. Smoking... let there be a decision
that you are not going</p><p>to smoke. Let the cigarette drop from your fingers, and then watch.
Just go on observing. Whenever you again want to smoke, don't say that
it is because of old habit.,It is again a fresh decision, not an old
habit. You go on throwing the responsibility on the old habit to save
your own face. Please don't do that. Say that,'Now I have decided to
smoke again.' Nobody is barring you; it is your decision. You can
cancel, or you can vote for it again. But always insist that it is a
fresh decision, and you will never be in the grip of so-called habits,
so-called mechanical habits. You will feel a free man. Smoking or not
smoking is immaterial; to feel a free man is very significant. Nothing
is more significant than that. And I am here to make you aware of your
freedom. If you go to the so- called saints, they will make you aware of
your mechanicalness: that is the difference. They will make you aware of
your mechanicalness, and they will create a new mechanicalness in you.
They will say,'You have been smoking for thirty years? Now take a vow
that you will never smoke again.' Old habit is there; now they are
telling you to create a greater habit in order to destroy the old habit.
Then non-smoking will become a habit, but the freedom is nowhere there.
Whether you smoke or don't smoke, you remain a victim.</p><p>We have a sannyasin here, Narendra Bodhisattva. His father is a very
beautiful man. People think that he is a little crazy, but he is really
a beautiful man. He belongs to a certain sect of Jainism. He went on a
visit, on a pilgrimage, and when you go to Jain monks they always ask
you to take a vow because otherwise your going on the pilgrimage is
meaningless. The monk there asked him to take some vow, so he decided to
take a vow. He said,'I have never smoked in my life -</p><p>- now I will smoke.' The monk must have thought him crazy. He came
back and he told me,'This vow I have taken.' And now he RELIGIOUS
smokes. I said,'You are a beautiful man. You did well.' Whether you
smoke or don't smoke, all vows lead you to mechanicalness.</p><p>My whole emphasis is that you should become aware of your freedom.
Let your life flow out of your freedom. Whatsoever you decide is up to
you. Who am I to tell you to smoke or not to smoke, to drink or not to
drink? I am not worried about such foolishnesses; this is for you to
decide. You are your own master.</p><p>These are trivia; they are not significant. All that matters is that
you remain alert, remain centered in your freedom. Never do anything
which goes against your freedom. Do -- everything is allowed if it is
done out of freedom. To act out of freedom is to be virtuous, to act out
of bondage is to sin.</p><p>The fourth question:</p><p>Question 4</p><p>YOU SAY THAT IF A MAN IS THIRSTY HE SHOULD COME AND DRINK FROM YOU.
WE ARE HERE AS MUCH AS WE CAN BE, AND YOU ARE HERE, ARE YOU NOT? SO WHAT
IS MISSING?</p><p>Nothing is missing! On the contrary, something is there which is not
needed. Nothing is missing. There is something which is not needed: you
are too much.</p><p>Your too-muchness is creating the barrier. If you can somehow miss,
the thing will happen immediately. When you come to me the next time,
leave yourself back at home. Come alone; don't bring yourself here. But
you go on bringing yourself. If it is too difficult to leave yourself at
home, then leave yourself where you leave your shoes.</p><p>Nothing is missing. The whole problem of man is not that something is
lacking in him, but that something more it is a problem of plusses. I am
here, available, but you are is there which is not needed. It is not a
problem of minusses, not there to receive me. It is not because you are
empty, but because you are too full, too full of yourself. There is no
space for me to enter into you: so many thoughts, so many ideas, so many
ideologies. Somebody is a Christian, somebody is a Hindu, somebody is a
Mohammedan, somebody is a Jain -- so many diseases; this is the plus.
And among these diseases is sitting the king of all diseases -- the ego;
enthroned, crowned. This plus has to be dissolved.</p><p>Here you have to be wakened, empty, void, open, so that the breeze
that is blowing here can pass through you without any obstruction. And
with the breeze, the dust that you have gathered through many lives will
be blown out.</p><p>You will be left clean and pure.</p><p>So remember this: whenever you ask such questions, you think that you
have to do something which you are not doing, that something is missing.
No, you are doing something which is not needed to be done. While
listening to me you are thinking -- that is the plus. While listening
'to me just be a listening. There is no</p><p>need to think, because I am not propounding a philosophy here. I am
simply stating a few facts. Those facts are not hypothetical; those
facts are my realizations. I have come to see something which I would
like to deliver to you.</p><p>But if you are listening without thinking, only then is it possible.
When I say don't think, I don't mean that whatsoever I say you have to
accept blindly. No, I'm simply saying: just listen; no need to believe
in it, no need to disbelieve in it.</p><p>Don't bring that problem in right now. Just listen so that you can
understand what I am saying. Later on you can think about it, and you
can decide whether to be with me or not to be with me. That decision is
possible only if you have listened rightly.</p><p>And how will you decide if you have not been listening to me? This is
the beauty of it, that if you have listened rightly, a fact has a
certain quality in it: so that once it enters into you, you cannot deny
it, you cannot be against it. A fact has a self-evidence about it. It
does not need any proof or argument. It has a truth in it.</p><p>Once you listen you can feed that truth within you. Just listen to
me, and then there will be no need to think about it. You will be able
to see the truth of it, and truth liberates.</p><p>I cannot liberate you, nobody can liberate you; only truth can
liberate you. And the truth has to be seen by YOU. I may be seeing it, I
may be telling it to you. In a thousand and one ways I may be showering
it upon you, but that is useless if you are not open, if your pot is
upside down, if you are not listening When I am speaking, if
simultaneously you go on thinking of what I am saying, if you go on like
commentators in a cricket match and you go on commenting -- 'Yes, this
is right, that is wrong; that I cannot believe; this goes against my
philosophy; I am a Christian, what this man is saying is anti-Christian;
this is not written in the Bible' -- if you go on commenting, while you
are commenting you are missing me. Then you may listen to bits and
fragments, and out of those bits and fragments you may create something
within you which has nothing to do with me.</p><p>Listen to me as totally as possible. Listening to me, be completely
vacant, empty, so that there is no resistance. I can pass through and
through you; you become transparent to me. Once the truth-seed falls
into you, there is no need to be worried; it sprouts on its own. It
brings much fruit on its own. It does not need</p><p>your help. It simply needs one thing: please don't hinder it. You are
not asked to help it to grow, you are only asked to allow it to fall in
the right soil of your heart.</p><p>The fifth question:</p><p>Question 5</p><p>SHOULD ONE FIRST COME TO TERMS WITH ONE'S OWN LONELINESS BEFORE
ENTERING INTO RELATIONSHIP?</p><p>Yes, you have to come to terms with your loneliness, so much so that
the loneliness is transformed into aloneness. Only then will you be
capable of moving into a deep enriching relationship. Only then will you
be able to move into love. What do I mean when I say that one has to
come to terms with one's loneliness, so much so that it becomes
aloneness?</p><p>Loneliness is a negative state of mind. Aloneness is positive,
notwithstanding what the dictionaries say. In dictionaries, loneliness
and aloneness are synonymous -- they are synonyms; in life they are not.
Loneliness is a state of mind when you are constantly missing the other,
aloneness is the state of mind when you are constantly delighted in
yourself. Loneliness is miserable, aloneness is blissful. Loneliness is
always worried, missing something, hankering for something, desiring for
something; aloneness is a deep fulfillment, not going out, tremendously
content, happy, celebrating. In loneliness you are off center, in
aloneness you are centered and rooted. Aloneness is beautiful. It has an
elegance around it, a grace, a climate of tremendous satisfaction.
Loneliness is; beggarly; all around it there is begging and nothing
else. It has no grace around it. In fact it is ugly. Loneliness is a
dependence, aloneness is SHEER independence. One feels as if one is
one's whole world, one's whole existence.</p><p>Now, if you move into a relationship when you are feeling lonely,
then you will exploit the other. The other will become a means to
satisfy you. You will use the other, and everybody resents being used
because no man is here to become a means for anybody else. Every man is
an end unto himself. Nobody is here to be used like a thing, everybody
is here to be worshipped like a king. Nobody is here to fulfill anybody
else's expectations, everybody is here just to be himself. So whenever
you move in any relationship out of loneliness, the relationship is
already on the rocks. Even before it has started, it is already on the
rocks. Even</p><p>before the birth, the child is dead. It is going to create more
misery for you. And remember, when you move from your loneliness you
will fall in relationship with somebody who is in the same plight,
because no man who is really living his aloneness will be attracted
towards you. You will be too below him. He can, at the most, sympathize,
but cannot love you. One who is on his peak of aloneness can only be
attracted towards somebody who is also alone. So whenever you move out
of loneliness, you will find a man of the same type; you will find your
own reflection somewhere. Two beggars will meet, two miserable people
will meet. And remember, when two miserable people meet, it is not an
ordinary addition, it is a multiplication. They create much more misery
for each other than they could have created in their loneliness.</p><p>First become alone. First start enjoying yourself. First love
yourself. First become so authentically happy that if nobody comes it
doesn't matter; you are full, overflowing. If nobody knocks at your door
it is perfectly okay -- YOU are not missing. You are not waiting for
somebody to come and knock at the door. You are at home. If somebody
comes, good, beautiful. If nobody comes, that too is beautiful and
good.</p><p>THEN move into relationship. Now you move like a master, not like a
beggar.</p><p>Now you move like an emperor,. not like a beggar. And the person who
has lived in his aloneness will always be attracted to another person
who is also living his aloneness beautifully, because the same attracts
the same. When two masters meet -- masters of their being, of their
aloneness -- happiness is not just added, it is multiplied. It becomes a
tremendous phenomenon of celebration.</p><p>And they don't exploit, they share. They don't use each other.
Rather, on the contrary, they both become one and enjoy the existence
that surrounds them.</p><p>Two lonely people are always facing each other, confronting. Two
people who have known aloneness are together, facing something higher
than both. I always give this example: two ordinary lovers who are both
lonely always face each other; two real lovers, on a full moon night,
will not be facing each other. They may be holding hands, but they will
be facing the full moon high in the sky. They will not be facing each
other, they will be together facing something else.</p><p>Sometimes they will be listening to a symphony of Mozart or Beethoven
or Wagner together. Sometimes they will be sitting by the side of a tree
and</p><p>enjoying the tremendous being of the tree enveloping them. Sometimes
they may be sitting by a waterfall and listening to the wild music that
is continuously being created there. Sometimes, by the ocean, they will
both be looking to the farthest possibility that the eyes can see.
Whenever two lonely persons meet, they look at each other, because they
are constantly in search of ways and means to exploit the other: how to
use the other, how to be happy through the other. But two persons who
are deeply contented within themselves are not trying to use each other.
Rather, they become fellow travellers; they move on a pilgrimage.</p><p>The goal is high, the goal is far away. Their common interest joins
them together.</p><p>Ordinarily the common interest is sex. Sex can join two persons
momentarily and casually, and very superficially. Real lovers have a
greater common interest. It is not that sex will not be there; it may be
there, but as part of a higher harmony.</p><p>Listening to Mozart's or Beethoven's symphony, they may come so
close, so close, so close, that there may be love. They may make love to
each other, but it is in the greater harmony of a Beethoven symphony.
The symphony was the real thing; the love happens as part of it. And
when love happens of its own accord, unsought, unthought, simply happens
as part of a higher harmony, it has a totally different quality to it.
it is divine, it is no longer human.</p><p>The word 'happiness' comes from a Scandanavian word 'hap'. The
word'happening' also comes from the same Scandanavian root. Happiness is
that which happens. You cannot produce it, you cannot command it, you
cannot force it. At the most, you can be available to it. Whenever it
happens, it happens.</p><p>Two real lovers are always available, but never thinking, never
trying to find happiness. Then they are never frustrated, because
whenever it happens it happens. They create the situation. In fact, if
you are happy with yourself, you are already the situation, and if the
other is also happy with himself or herself, she is also the situation.
When these two situations come close, a greater situation is created. In
that greater situation much happens -- nothing is produced.</p><p>Man has not to do anything to be happy. Man has just to flow and let
go.</p><p>So, the question is: should one first come to terms with his own
loneliness before entering into relationship? Yes; yes, absolutely. It
has to be so, otherwise you</p><p>will be frustrated, and in the name of love you will be doing
something else which is not love at all.</p><p>The last question:</p><p>Question 6</p><p>OSHO, I FEEL YOUR GRACE MELTING ME. LOVE TO YOU MY MASTER.</p><p>It is from Anup.</p><p>It is not a question. A real question is never a question, it is a
statement. This is a statement of Anup's state of being at this moment.
I can also feel that he is melting, but this is just the beginning.</p><p>Don't become too self-conscious about it, or else the melting will
stop Allow it so that more and more becomes possible. Go on melting, and
always remember that more is waiting. Always remember that it is always
the beginning, never the end.</p><p>In fact, there is no end to it.</p><p>Life is such a mystery: there are only beginnings, no ends.</p><p>So, go on melting, always remembering that more is coming. Never
become satisfied. A complacent satisfaction can become suicidal. There
come many moments when one feels that more is not possible. One comes to
a peak and one feels,'Now, how is more possible?' Whenever this idea
that more is not possible arises in your mind, remember me. More is
always possible. There never comes a moment when more is not possible.
That is the meaning when we say that God is infinite: you enter into God
but you never reach. Let me repeat it again: you enter into God but you
never reach Him. You can drown in Him but you cannot say that you have
known Him. It is so vast, so infinitely vast, and man is just a tiny
drop.</p><p>Go on melting, always remembering that more is on the way.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=come-follow-to-you-vol-4>Come Follow To You, Vol 4</h3><h3 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=chapter-7>Chapter #7</h3><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=chapter-title-the-ego-is-the-judas>Chapter title: The Ego is the

WITNESS AGAINST THEE?</p><p>14 AND HE ANSWERED TO HIM NEVER A WORD; INSOMUCH THAT THE</p><p>GOVERNOR MARVELLED GREATLY.</p><p>A MAN was travelling through the wilderness when he came across some
animals having a speech contest. The judge was a lion who invited the
man to become part of the audience. The man accepted.</p><p>A fox stood up and gave a smooth and clever speech. At one point, he
declared,'The moon is larger than the sun.'</p><p>The next speaker was an elephant whose voice boomed out with power
and authority. His talk included the sentence,'Summer is cooler than
winter.'</p><p>Then came a tiger whose eloquence impressed everyone. At one point he
said,'The river runs uphill.'</p><p>The observing man remarked to the lion,'They are superb orators.
However, I'm puzzled. All of them made statements which were obviously
untrue. Not only that, but the audience either did not notice or did not
care. Why do your speakers make false statements?</p><p>'That's an unworthy habit, alright,' admitted the lion,'but the
audience is more interested in entertainment than in enlightenment. And,
if you don't mind sir, I would like to tell you that we have picked up
this bad habit from you human beings.'</p><p>The priests, the politicians: they are great orators, superb; great
thinkers, very complex weavers, spinners of theories, philosophies, but,
they are not sincere about religion. They use religion. Religion is, at
the most, a profession. And the audience is not interested in
enlightenment, the audience is seeking entertainment. Whether you go to
a cinema hall or to a theatre, to a dancing party, or to the church or
the temple, your interest is the same: you are seeking some place where
you can forget yourself. You are seeking entertainment.</p><p>Enlightenment is just the opposite. You will have to seek a space
within yourself where it becomes impossible to forget yourself; where
even if you want, it is not possible to forget; where self-remembering
becomes a constant flame.</p><p>Here is the point where people like Jesus create trouble. They are
not great orators. They are not interested in theories and they are not
there to entertain anybody. They are not professionals. They are not
using religion for their own ends. They are sincere people -- sincerely
interested in helping, sincerely interested in creating a situation
where man can realize himself. The trouble starts because the
professionals are already there; the priests, the politicians are
already there.</p><p>Whenever a man like Jesus enters into the world, the priests and the
politicians become alert. It is dangerous for them. If Jesus succeeds,
they will be thrown, uprooted. The whole establishment will collapse. If
the establishment has to remain, then Jesus has to be destroyed.</p><p>This is the first thing to be understood because this is always
happening, even today, and this will go on happening History goes on
repeating itself not because there is any natural law that history
should repeat itself, but only because man has not changed. Man remains
the same, the old. He behaves again and again in</p><p>the same way. You are here with me; many priests are worried about
it, many politicians are worried about it. Why should they be worried?
It is none of their business -- but it is. Their very base is that
religion should not become a sincere search. It should remain, at the
most, a superficial entertainment; at the most, a mannerism, an
etiquette. And they are afraid, because if somebody like Jesus asserts
himself, the very presence of Jesus creates a deep inferiority in them.
Not that Jesus is trying to make them inferior; Jesus is not even aware
of it. He has not even thought about it. But through his very
presence... the sun rises in the morning, and the stars, disappear.
Whenever Jesus is there, the priests start disappearing. The politicians
are in a difficulty; they cannot hold their ground.</p><p>I have heard a very beautiful anecdote about a certain doctor, Buzby.
He was a great headmaster in England, a very famous headmaster. Even the
king became interested. And once, the king went to see the headmaster in
his school. The king was allowed in the school. Doctor Buzby started
through the schoolrooms with his hat on his head, while His Majesty
walked complacently behind him with his hat under his arm. The other
people who had followed the king were a little disturbed and worried and
restless:'Is this headmaster a little eccentric? He has not shown even
that much respect to the king; he could have taken his hat off.'</p><p>Even the king was a little uneasy about it, but he didn't say
anything.</p><p>When he was taking his leave at the door, the doctor, with great
humility, then addressed the king,'I hope Your Majesty will excuse my
want of respect hitherto, but if my boys were to imagine that there were
a greater man in the kingdom than myself, I should never be able to rule
them. So please excuse me.' He said,'They should know that even the king
is not greater than their headmaster.</p><p>Otherwise, it would be impossible to rule them again.'</p><p>This is what happens when a Jesus walks on the earth: the
politicians, the priests, become afraid. They cannot allow the common
man to know that a greater possibility exists, that a greater man is
possible. Otherwise, they will not be able to rule again. Hence, Jesus
has to be crucified. He has to be destroyed before the public so the
public can know well 'who is the boss here'.</p><p>Listen to the sutras.</p><p>AND WHILE HE YET SPAKE, LO, JUDAS, ONE OF THE TWELVE, CAME, AND WITH
HIM A GREAT MULTITUDE WITH SWORDS AND STAVES,</p><p>FROM THE CHIEF PRIESTS AND ELDERS OF THE PEOPLE.</p><p>Judas was Jesus' own disciple. He betrayed him. Only love can betray,
because to betray somebody, you have to come close to him. To hate
somebody, first you have to love him. Remember this complexity of love:
whenever you love somebody, a part of you goes on hating because love
requires surrender, and the ego resists. Love requires that you should
be lost, that you should become one with your lover, your Master, your
beloved, your friend, your God. Love requires that you should disappear,
and the ego resists, the ego starts struggling against it. Judas is
nothing but a representation of the ego. And remember that Judas exists
in each of you; in everybody, the ego is the Judas.</p><p>Let me repeat it again. Those twelve disciples of Jesus were very
simple people, except for Judas. They were uneducated people, common
people, people of the earth. You would not have recognized them anywhere
in a crowd. They would have been lost. Only Judas was not ordinary. He
was polished, educated, cultured, sophisticated: that's what the ego is.
Ego is nothing but a sophistication.</p><p>Ego is nothing but the part which has become extraordinary in you.
When you love, you become ordinary.</p><p>Remember, people who are very egoistic are always against love. In
India you will find them in the monasteries, in the Himalayas. People
who are very egoistic are against love. They may say that they are
leaving the world, the world of love, to seek and search for God. They
are deceiving nobody except themselves; because unless you love
tremendously, you cannot seek God. In the Himalayan peaks, they are
seeking nothing but their own egos. God is to be sought in love because
God is to be sought in your own crucifixion; when the ego disappears, He
is.</p><p>Have you watched in your own mind that whenever you are moving in a
love relationship, there arises a certain uneasiness? You are allured,
fascinated. You would like to delve deeply into it, but a part of you
starts becoming uneasy. Look at that part; that is Judas. That part
says,'What are you going to do? -- surrender?</p><p>What are you going to do? -- become ordinary?'</p><p>Nothing is more ordinary than love. Love is very earthly. Nothing is
more natural than love. Nobody needs to learn it; everybody is born
knowing it. Love is all over. The whole existence throbs in love. Love
is the very beat of life. Love</p><p>is very natural, very ordinary.</p><p>The ego is *unnatura1, extraordinary: you want to feel superior to
others, you want to be crowned. You don't want to belong to the earth
because all belong to the earth. You want something to be special, to be
somebody special -- it is the Judas.</p><p>To betray, one needs to be in love.</p><p>Judas loved Jesus, but could not love totally. That is the problem:
if you love and you don't love totally, you can betray at any moment,
because the part that is not yet in love will go on finding ways and
means to rebel, to go against. Then Jesus was crucified because of this
betrayal. The next day, Judas committed suicide.</p><p>That too is a very deep, a deeply meaningful parable. Why did he
commit suicide himself the next day? Because then there was no point --
the whole ego had been existing against Jesus. He loved Jesus, but only
a part, and a part was fighting.</p><p>Now with Jesus crucified, that part which was fighting disappeared.
There was no point now, and he could not have found a man like Jesus
again to hate, to fight, to struggle against, to love. Once Jesus was
gone, Judas was meaningless.</p><p>Once Jesus was gone, the whole existence of Judas became empty. He
committed suicide. In his life there was meaning because of Jesus; he
loved and hated the man. On one side he loved, on another side he
hated.</p><p>A Judas means: one who is divided within himself. A Judas means: one
who is schizophrenic, split. Judas is not just the name of a certain
person who betrayed Jesus; Judas is a disease. Judas is a psychological
split.</p><p>So while listening to these sutras, always remember that you can be a
Judas, and you can be a Jesus also. If the split disappears, you are a
Jesus. If the split goes on existing, you remain a Judas. Between Judas
and Jesus there is just a little distance, and the distance is that of
division. Are you divided in your love? --</p><p>then you are a Judas. Are you undivided in your love? -- then you are
a Jesus.</p><p>AND WHILE HE YET SPAKE, LO, JUDAS, ONE OF THE TWELVE, CAME, AND WITH
HIM A GREAT MULTITUDE WITH SWORDS AND STAVES,</p><p>FROM THE CHIEF PRIESTS AND ELDERS OF THE PEOPLE.</p><p>NOW HE THAT BETRAYED HIM GAVE THEM A SIGN, SAVING: WHOMSOEVER I SHALL
KISS, THAT SAME IS HE; HOLD HIM FAST.</p><p>Very symbolic -- betraying Jesus by kissing him -- the kiss of death.
The same kiss that could have been of love, was of betrayal. The SAME
kiss that could have been of love, was of betrayal. The same kiss that
could been of life became part of death. The same kiss which could have
been elixir, ambrosia, became poison. The kiss is the same, but the
quality that you bring to it makes it either the ambrosia of eternal
life or makes it poison.</p><p>Remember: gestures are always the same; only you change behind them.
Only you change; gestures are the same. You love, you hate, you
surrender, you resist; gestures are the same. But the quality behind
them changes, because gestures are only containers; whatsoever you put
inside them is the real thing.</p><p>Judas had chosen a kiss as an indication.</p><p>He said to the multitude, to the enemies,'Whomsoever I shall kiss,
that same is he; hold him fast.' He could have chosen some other gesture
also. Anything would have been indicative, so why a kiss?</p><p>A part of him loved Jesus; a part of him loved him tremendously.
Never be very hard on Judas. Christians have been very hard. Have
compassion. Never be very hard on Judas, because he is hidden within you
also. Don't just hate him because he betrayed, because you also have the
same tendency to betray. Every human being is prone to become a Judas. I
say to you, have compassion on him. Try to understand him. Why had he
chosen the kiss? He could have chosen any indication.</p><p>A part of him really loved Jesus, but a part hated him. It was a
love-hate relationship. It was both, a dichotomy. Remember, if your love
is nothing but an opposition to hate, if your love is nothing but an
opposite to hate, the hate will exist within you. There is another
dimension of love where love is only the absence of hate, not opposite
to it. I teach you THAT love: love as an absence of hate. The real
problem is not how to love; the real problem is how to understand hate
and drop it through that understanding. Don't hide your hate, don't
suppress it; bring it out, get rid of it. Before you can be able to
really love and love totally, hate has to be dropped. You can do a
simple thing: you can hide the hate and you</p><p>can go on loving. But the hate which is hiding behind you is going to
betray, some day or other. You are a Judas, and you are going to be a
Judas.</p><p>Until Judas betrayed Jesus, he himself was not aware of what he was
doing. He became aware only when Jesus was crucified, when he himself
saw what he had done. Then he became aware. Then he repented, and
committed suicide.</p><p>... I SHALL KISS, THE SAME IS HE; HOLD HIM FAST. AND FORTHWITH HE</p><p>CAME TO JESUS, AND SAID: HAIL, MASTER; AND KISSED HIM.</p><p>IN THAT SAME HOUR SAID JESUS TO THE MULTITUDES: ARE YE COME</p><p>OUT AS AGAINST A THIEF WITH SWORDS AND STAVES FOR TO TAKE</p><p>ME? I SAT DAILY WITH YOU TEACHING IN THE TEMPLE, AND YE LAID</p><p>NO HOLD ON ME.</p><p>Jesus was moving with the multitudes, in the marketplace, in the
temple; he was teaching. He said to these people,'Why have you come with
swords and staves, as if you have come against a thief? And I have
always been a part of you, I have always lived amongst you, I have been
teaching in the temple, so why do you come in the middle of the night
with swords, with such a big crowd to catch me, to hold me? Why? You
could have caught me any day. And there is no need for swords. You know
well that I have got no swords to fight with.' What was Jesus saying to
them? He had not said a single word to Judas. That's very, very
meaningful.</p><p>There was nothing to say to Judas. All that could have been said, had
been said.</p><p>On Judas he had been working for years, but it seemed that the
disease was incurable. It seemed that the more he had tried to change
him, the more he had become resistant and stubborn, It seemed the more
attention had been given to him, the more he had become egoistic. He
didn't say a single word to Judas, but he talked to the multitudes, to
the crowd.</p><p>Why had this crowd come with swords? They were afraid, afraid of what
they were going to commit. Remember this, because to come to Jesus with
swords is simply meaningless, absurd. He is a simple man who has always
been moving everywhere, who could have been caught any day, by anybody;
a fragile body.</p><p>There was no problem, ever. Why with swords? Try to understand.</p><p>Whenever you carry a sword, it is not against anybody else; it is
only because you are afraid. It is because of your fear. They were
afraid. For what they were going to commit, they were already guilty
about it. These swords were not against Jesus because they were not
needed against him. Those swords were against their own guilt, their own
fear, their own cowardice. They knew well that to face Jesus was going
to be difficult. Just to look into his eyes would be very difficult. And
to catch hold of him, to make him a prisoner was going to be almost
impossible.</p><p>They came with swords to have courage, to not be afraid. They came
with swords so there would be no need to look into this man's eyes.
Bare-handed, he could have been caught anywhere. He was absolutely
unprotected, insecure.</p><p>And these people knew him well. There was no need, in fact, for Judas
even to indicate who he was. Everybody knew about him.</p><p>But the priests were also afraid, the politicians were also afraid.
They also wanted to throw the responsibility on somebody else who could
be, could become, the scapegoat for centuries to come. They found Judas.
Then Judas became the symbol of betrayal. It is as if Judas became the
real culprit.</p><p>IN THAT SAME HOUR SAID JESUS TO THE MULTITUDES: ARE YE COME</p><p>OUT AS AGAINST A THIEF WITH SWORDS AND STAVES FOR TO TAKE</p><p>ME? I SAT DAILY WITH YOU TEACHING IN THE TEMPLE, AND YE LAID</p><p>NO HOLD ON ME.</p><p>BUT ALL THIS WAS DONE, THAT THE SCRIPTURES OF THE PROPHETS</p><p>MIGHT BE FULFILLED.</p><p>This point is significant. In the life of Jesus, or in the life of
Krishna, or in the life of Buddha, this point is very significant. They
always speak as if they are playing a part in a drama, as if they are
simply acting, as if this earth is a great stage and they are fulfilling
simple prophecies.</p><p>It is said that before Rama was born, a great poet, Valmiki, wrote
Rama's whole life; before he was born! And then Rama was born; he had to
follow Valmiki, because when such a great poet writes something, it has
to be followed. What else can you do?</p><p>It may not have been so, but the story is beautiful. It says that
life is a drama: as if it has been written already and it is only
unfolding.</p><p>Jesus said to those people,'But all this was done that the scriptures
of the prophets might be fulfilled.' It was said in the old scriptures
that this was the way the Messiah was to be caught, crucified. This was
the way that the Messiah was to be betrayed by his own disciple,
Judas.</p><p>What is Jesus saying? He's saying to Judas, in an indirect way,'Don't
feel guilty about it. It is just a fulfillment of a prophecy. You are
not responsible.' This is his love. He is taking the responsibility from
Judas. He is saying,'Don't be afraid, don't feel guilty, don't feel
responsible. You are not doing anything. You are just an instrument in
the hands of history. It has been prophesied long before that one of my
disciples would betray me. You are just instrumental.'</p><p>This is what Krishna said to Arjuna in the Gita:'Don't be worried.
You simply fight the war. You are just instrumental; NIMITTA MATRA --
you are not the doer. The doer is always God. You are just a vehicle
that He is using. You just surrender yourself into the hands of the
whole, and let things happen.</p><p>Whatsoever is going to happen is going to happen. You relax. Please
don't be tense about it.'</p><p>The same is Jesus' meaning when he says,'But all this was done that
the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.' He is saying to
Judas,'Don't be worried.' He is saying to the multitudes,'Don't feel
afraid. Nobody is doing anything wrong. Everything is okay, because this
is how it had to happen. This is a beautiful gesture on Jesus' part.</p><p>Just a few days ago I was reading the story of a Hassid mystic, Baal
Shem. One day he was sitting just in front of his house. It must have
been a winter morning like this, cold, and he was sunning himself. A
beggar came. He told the beggar to wait and he would go in the house to
search for something for him. But he could not find anything; there was
nothing. The wife had gone to some neighbor, and he could only find his
wife's ring, the wedding ring that he had given her. He came with the
ring and gave it to the beggar.</p><p>When the wife returned and found her ring missing, she asked. Baal
Shem told the whole story:'I searched, but nothing could be found.'</p><p>The wife created much trouble for him. She said,'You run after him!
Catch hold of the beggar. That ring is my wedding ring and it is very
costly, almost a hundred gold coins!'</p><p>Baal Shem ran to catch hold of the beggar, and many people followed
him --</p><p>'What is going to happen?' They could not believe that Baal Shem
could do that, but he ran. In the marketplace, he found the beggar. He
caught hold of him and said,'Wait! Listen to me! That ring is very
costly. It can fetch almost one hundred gold coins. Don't allow anybody
to cheat you.' That's all that he did, and he went back.</p><p>You cannot understand the gesture of love. Everybody in the
neighborhood thought that he was going to take hold of that beggar and
take the ring back. The wife was very happy when he ran; she also
thought so. Because we live in such a loveless heart, we cannot
understand the gesture of love.</p><p>It is a gesture of love when Jesus says,'But all this was done that
the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.'</p><p>Remember well, he does not mean what he says. Christians have been
befooled by the words. They think that exactly what he is saying, he
also means. No.</p><p>Existence is freedom. It is not determined beforehand. It is not
predestined. If it were predestined then all meaning would be lost. Life
is not a drama, but you can take it as a drama. If you take it as a
drama, you transcend life. But remember, life is not a drama; life is
total freedom. Nobody can predict what is going to happen the next
moment, because the next moment comes as if out of the blue, totally
free and fresh. If it could be predicted, then all meaning would</p><p>be lost.</p><p>Jesus is not saying that he believes in fate. Jesus is not saying
that he believes that life is absolutely determined, every bit of it,
no. Then why does he say this:'But all this was done that the scriptures
of the prophets might be fulfilled'? This is a gesture of love. He is
trying to create a situation in which Judas should not feel guilty. He
is creating a situation in which the multitudes which have come to take
over, to make him prisoner, should not feel guilty. He is saying that it
has to be so, so it is happening; nobody is at fault. He is making
everybody free of fault.</p><p>This is a love gesture; tremendously loving and caring about
people.</p><p>His last words on the cross were again the same:'Father, forgive
them, because they don't know what they are doing.</p><p>BUT ALL THIS WAS DONE, THAT THE SCRIPTURES OF THE PROPHETS MIGHT BE
FULFILLED.</p><p>THEN THE DISCIPLES FORSOOK HIM, AND FLED -- one betrayed, the</p><p>remaining fled. To be a disciple is really a very arduous thing.</p><p>When everything was going well, disciples were there. But now
everything was going wrong. Jesus is being caught; disciples start
disappearing. They fled. This is the moment, the moment which will
decide who is a disciple. Judas betrayed, but the others who fled also
betrayed in a way. Their betrayal was negative and Judas' betrayal was
positive, but both were betrayals. It is really difficult to become a
disciple, because when things are going good everything can be with the
Master, but when things start going bad, and every hill has a valley,
and every day has a night... even Jesus has a dark night following him.
In the day you can be with Jesus, but in the night, when darkness
surrounds and everywhere is fear; when death is lurking all around, then
to be with Jesus -- there is the test, there is the criterion -- of
whether you are really a disciple or not.</p><p>I have heard a beautiful story. It is not exactly a story, but a real
thing: it happened.</p><p>Shortly after the Second World War, a devastated city in England
began its heart-</p><p>breaking and wearing work of restoration. In the old city square had
stood a large statue of Jesus Christ with his hands outspread, in an
attitude of invitation.</p><p>On the pedestal were carved the words: Come unto me. In the process
of the restoration of the statue, with the aid of master artists and
sculptors, the figure eventually was reassembled except for the hands,
of which no fragments could be discovered anywhere in the surrounding
rubble. Someone made the suggestion that the artist would have to
fashion new hands, since the former hands could not be found. Later came
a public protest, couched in the words,'No, leave him without hands.' So
today, in the public square of that English city, the restored statue of
Christ stands without hands, and on its base are carved the words:
Christ has no hands but ours.</p><p>Those twelve hands all betrayed: one positively, eleven negatively.
And Christ has no hands except ours, because Christ is a being, PURE
being. And all that is to be done is to be done through us, through the
hands. In that moment, when Judas betrayed and the remaining eleven
fled, Jesus was left without hands, a pure being. In fact, that moment
was the moment of crucifixion. The next day, it was nothing new. In that
moment, the hands of Christ were cut. In that moment, the real
crucifixion happened. The next day was just a repetition of it in more
materialistic terms, but spiritually, Jesus was left without hands.</p><p>WHEN THE MORNING WAS COME, ALL THE CHIEF PRIESTS AND ELDERS</p><p>OF THE PEOPLE TOOK COUNSEL AGAINST JESUS TO PUT HIM TO DEATH: AND
WHEN THEY HAD BOUND HIM, THEY LED HIM AWAY, AND</p><p>DELIVERED HIM TO PONTIUS PILATE, THE GOVERNOR. AND JESUS</p><p>STOOD BEFORE THE GOVERNOR, AND THE GOVERNOR ASKED HIM, SAYING: ART
THOU THE KING OF THE JEWS? AND JESUS SAID UNTO</p><p>HIM: THOU SAYEST.</p><p>Jesus was tremendously misunderstood whenever he talked about the
kingdom of God. He never talked about the kingdom of this earth.
Whenever he said,'I am the King of the Jews,' he never meant to assert
any throne on this earth. He was saying something very symbolically. He
was saying that he was the cream of the</p><p>Jewish genius. He was saying that he was the heart of the Jewish
race. He was saying that he was the flower of the Jewish tree of life.
When he said that he was the king, he never meant that he was the king
politically.</p><p>But this is always so: you have to use the language of the people you
are talking to, and that very language which you wanted to communicate
with becomes the barrier, becomes the cause of all misunderstanding.</p><p>The people understood the superficial meaning of his words. Had they
been a little more in tune with themselves, had they been a little more
silent, had they been a little more meditative and prayerful, they would
have understood what Jesus was saying.</p><p>Many times I say things to you and immediately I feel that you must
have misunderstood me. I have to use words. You hear my words, you
cannot hear my meaning -- because the meaning is a silent shadow that
follows the word.</p><p>You hear the word and you supply the meaning. My meaning is lost.
Words may be mine, but meanings are yours.</p><p>Once it happened: A thirsty wanderer in the desert was in despair
over finding water. He struggled frantically from one hilltop to the
next in an effort to sight a stream which was supposed to be in that
region. His eyes searched in every direction, but without success. While
staggering through some dry bushes his foot caught on a branch, spilling
him to the ground. Exhausted, and dejected, he remained there. Feeling
no energy, feeling no motivation to move, feeling nowhere to go, he
remained there as if dead on the ground, listening to the surrounding
silence. The desert was absolutely silent. There was nothing except
silence. Suddenly, his head jerked upwards. He heard something new. It
was the faint but definite sound of running water. Strengthened by the
sound, he followed it all the way to a clear and cool stream of
water.</p><p>A silent but alert mind can hear the first faint invitation to
abundant supply and refreshment.</p><p>When you are near a man like Jesus, listen to his silence, not to his
words.If you only listen to his words you are bound to misunderstand
him. Just listen to his silence, and each of his words is followed by
silence. In fact, a man like Jesus speaks only so that you can hear his
silence. You will say,'Then why does he</p><p>speak in the first place?' If he did not speak, you would not be able
to understand his silence. Speech becomes the contrast, words become the
contrast. It is just as if you write on a blackboard with white chalk.
You can write on a white board with white chalk, but then it will be
impossible to read what is written.</p><p>A man like Jesus speaks: through his words he creates the blackboard,
and through his silence, the white chalk. Forget the blackboard. That is
just a device to bring silence to your heart, to bring silence to your
awareness.</p><p>THE GOVERNOR ASKED JESUS: ART THOU THE KING OF THE JEWS? AND</p><p>JESUS SAID UNTO HIM: THOU SAYEST.'I am not saying,' he said.'I have
not said it. It is you who are saying it. If you say so, it's okay.'</p><p>AND WHEN HE WAS ACCUSED OF THE CHIEF PRIESTS AND ELDERS, HE</p><p>ANSWERED NOTHING.</p><p>This has to be understood also. He answered Pilate; at least he
said,'Thou sayest.'</p><p>But when the priests and the elders accused him of a thousand and one
things, he answered nothing. Why?</p><p>Pontius Pilate was a stranger. It is possible sometimes to speak to a
stranger. It is very difficult to speak to people who think they are
familiar with you, who already think that they know you. It is
impossible to speak to the people who think they know you, because
whatsoever you say is not going to help; they already know you. They
will interpret you in the old way, in their way, so that they understand
you. Pilate was absolutely a stranger. He was a Roman governor, he was
not a Jew. He was not at all concerned with the Jewish religion.</p><p>Jesus looked at the governor, and he said,'Thou sayest.' He may have
been able to understand Jesus. And the story goes that Pilate felt very
much for him. He understood, a little. Being a stranger, it was possible
for him to understand this man. At least he could see him without any
prejudice. It was none of his concern: he was not a Jew, he was not a
priest, he was a foreigner. He could look at this man directly, without
any clouds in his mind. He felt for this man. This man looked absolutely
innocent. In fact, Pontius Pilate wanted him to be freed.</p><p>Two more persons were going to be crucified that day: two thieves
along with Jesus. And it was the custom that the people could ask for
one person to be freed.</p><p>One person could be freed by the governor, so the governor hoped that
they would ask for Jesus to be freed. He even hinted; he sent messages
to the elders, to the priests, saying,'It will be good if Jesus can be
freed. The man seems to be innocent.' But no, the people wanted his
blood. They asked that one of the thieves should be freed, not
Jesus.</p><p>A thief, a murderer, was freed and an absolutely innocent man was
killed. The man, the thief who was freed, himself became a disciple of
Jesus. Seeing the innocence of this man, he could not believe how he had
been freed. He was not worthy. The very phenomenon changed his life.</p><p>AND WHEN HE WAS ACCUSED OF THE CHIEF PRIESTS AND ELDERS, HE</p><p>ANSWERED NOTHING.</p><p>THEN SAID PILATE UNTO HIM: HEAREST THOU NOT HOW MANY THINGS THEY
WITNESS AGAINST THEE?</p><p>AND HE ANSWERED TO HIM NEVER A WORD; INSOMUCH THAT THE GOVERNOR
MARVELLED GREATLY.</p><p>Why did the governor marvel greatly at the silence of Jesus? His
silence was very, very eloquent. His remaining in silence showed much
that could not be said. Whenever a person feels guilty he starts
defending; that is natural.</p><p>Whenever you feel wrong you start arguing; that is natural. Whenever
you feel that something has gone amiss you start rationalizing; that is
natural.</p><p>If you are really innocent, then what is there to defend, argue,
rationalize? If you are really innocent, only silence can say anything.
Words won't help. Pilate, the governor, must have seen many criminals in
his life, all arguing.</p><p>I have heard a story: Once it happened that one great Russian Czar,
Peter, went</p><p>to see his prison. Once a year he used to go there, and it was up to
him to free anybody. If he took the fancy of freeing anybody, there was
nobody to hinder. So he would go from one cell to another, and all the
criminals, great criminals, murderers, would say,'Sir, -- we are
innocent. We have been unfairly caught.</p><p>Somebody else has done it. Have mercy on us!'</p><p>Only one man who was accused of murder and was sentenced for his
whole life said,'Sir, I am a criminal; I have committed the murder. And
I don't feel that even my whole life's imprisonment is enough
punishment. Give me more punishment! I feel guilty!'</p><p>Peter said,'Release this rascal immediately! He will corrupt others.
All are so innocent but this rascal.' That man was freed
immediately.</p><p>Innocence accepts. PURE innocence has nothing to reject, nothing to
accept. If you are a criminal, your whole mind will work on how to get
out of it. If you accept it, you are already out of it. But Jesus was
not a criminal at all. He had not committed any crime. He was the purest
soul ever. He had nothing to accept, nothing to reject that's the
meaning of his silence.</p><p>'And the governor marvelled'... he had never seen such a silent man,
so close to death yet so peaceful; so close to death and so relaxed; so
close to death and so un-defensive; so close to death and not trying in
any way to save himself -- so surrendered.</p><p>AND HE ANSWERED TO HIM NEVER A WORD; INSOMUCH THAT THE GOVERNOR
MARVELLED GREATLY.</p><p>Jesus succeeded as a rebel; he failed as a revolutionary. If you ask
buddhas, they will say that he succeeded. If you ask ordinary people,
they will say that he failed.</p><p>A great crowd had gathered on the day when he was crucified to see
whether he was going to do some miracle. They went home frustrated. No
miracle happened, no miracle at all. He died silently, as any ordinary
man would have died. There was not a difference, not a bit of
difference.</p><p>But I would like to tell you: give flowers to rebels who fail,
because all the</p><p>successful ones have always betrayed the revolution.</p><p>Every revolution has been a betrayed revolution. Only a rebel who
fails totally is a real rebel, because to succeed he will have to use
the ways and means of this world. And in using those ways and means is
the failure. Jesus died a humble man, in total surrender, without any
power; this is his success.</p><p>The church is a failure because the church has succeeded in becoming
a great establishment. Now, upon this earth, the Christian church is the
greatest establishment. Fords and Rockefellers, Morgans and Carnegies
are nothing; the Christian church is the greatest business on the earth
today. Other great companies are very, very small companies compared. to
the Christian church. It is a world-wide establishment. The church
succeeded and failed; Jesus failed and succeeded.</p><p>Give your flowers to rebels who have failed, because they are the
truly rebellious people.</p><p>A rebellious person remains individual; there is no other way. He
flowers, he blooms, and disappears. He does not leave any trace behind
of his success. In fact, there are no proofs to show that Jesus ever
existed; except for the Gospel, which is a Christian document, there is
no other proof that he ever existed.</p><p>Nowhere else is ke mentioned. How has it happened that such a great
phenomenon has not left any footprints?</p><p>The greater the phenomenon, the lesser the footprints in history. The
greater the phenomenon, the lesser the footprints in time. He succeeds
in eternity; he fails in time. Those who succeed in time fail in
eternity.</p><p>Give your flowers to those rebels who have failed.…</p><p>And Jesus is the topmost failure in the world. He failed
tremendously, he failed beautifully. He is a pinnacle of failure, the
climax, because he is a rebel, not a revolutionary. Lenin succeeded,
Gandhi succeeded, Mao succeeded; these are revolutionaries, they are not
rebels. They all betrayed the revolution. Once a rebellion becomes a
revolution, it is already on the path of betrayal.</p><p>If you really want to be a rebel -- and that is the only way to be a
religious person</p><p>-- then you have to be alone. Then you have to be an alone flame in
the infinite darkness around; without any organization, without any
establishment. You have to live alone. Only God is your companion,
nobody else. And that too is not right to say, that God is your
companion, because God is your innermost being.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;line-height:192%;text-align:left id=come-follow-to-you-vol-4-chapter-8>Come Follow To You, Vol 4

Hall</h3><p>The first question:</p><p>Question 1</p><p>YOU SAID WE SUFFER BECAUSE OF THE EGO. AND THEN YOU ALSO SAY</p><p>THAT THE EGO DOES NOT EXIST. MY SUFFERING IS REAL. HOW CAN IT</p><p>BE CAUSED BY SOMETHING THAT IS NOT REAL, THAT DOESN'T EXIST?</p><p>YOU can suffer in a dream, you can suffer in a nightmare. While it
lasts, to all practical purposes, it appears real. But when you awake,
then you know it was not real, and even then you know that you had
suffered. You may still be perspiring, you may still be trembling
because of the nightmare. Your heart may still be beating faster than
usual. Awake, you know that it was just a dream, but still you suffered.
Not only that, but even now when you are awake, there is a hang-over.
The after-effects are still continuing.</p><p>You suffer from an ego which does not exist. In fact, you suffer
because it does not exist and you go on believing that it exists. If you
believe in something which is not, you are bound to suffer because you
will try in every possible way to feel that it exists. But it cannot
exist. Just watch: whenever you suffer, watch; where does it hurt? --
you will always find that it is the'I', the ego that hurts.</p><p>You would like to live a life where there is no suffering, but that
life is not possible if you continuously carry the ego with you. You
cannot make a life around you so that suffering disappears. If you carry
the ego, again and again you will bump into some reality which will hurt
the unreal. Whenever there is an encounter between reality and
unreality, the unreal causes suffering.</p><p>I have heard one anecdote about a very famous man, Oscar Wilde. At a
function where the views of celebrities were being canvassed, Oscar
Wilde was asked to compile his list of a hundred best books.'I fear,'
said he,'that would be impossible.''Why?' he was asked. He said,'Because
I have only written five.'</p><p>You go on looking at life just from one single point -- you. Humanity
used to believe that earth was the center of the universe; and man, of
course, the center of the earth; and you, of course, the center of
humanity.</p><p>I have heard about a professor of philosophy in the university of
Paris. One day he declared,'I am the greatest man in the world!'</p><p>The disciples laughed: he was a poor philosopher. But whenever;he
said something he must mean something, so they asked. And they
asked,'You being a logician, please prove it.'</p><p>He brought a map of the world into the class, and said to the
students,'Which is the greatest country in the world? Can you tell me,
can you show me?'</p><p>They were all French, so of course France was the greatest country in
the world.</p><p>So he said,'Now, the whole world is hot the-question. If I can prove
that I am the greatest man in France, then I am proved.'</p><p>They said,'That looks right.' But now they started feeling a little
uneasy. He said,'And which is the greatest city in France?'</p><p>Of course, they were all Parisians, so it was Paris. Now they became
even more afraid; he was bringing the truth home.</p><p>And then he said,'Which is the greatest and the holiest place in
Paris?' Of course, it was the university.</p><p>'And which is the greatest department in the university?' Of course,
it was the department of philosophy.</p><p>And he said,'I am the head of the department!'</p><p>When for the first time it was discovered that the earth was not the
center of the universe, it damaged the human ego tremendously. The
church fought it because it was not only a question of the earth. Deep
down it was a question of the human ego: if the earth is not the center,
then man cannot be the center; and if earth is just a far-off outer
post, and not at the center of existence, then man may be, at the most,
a coincidence. The so-called religious people struggled against the
idea.</p><p>Galileo was called into the court, an old man, and was asked to
confess his sin: that he had committed a mistake, and to admit it. He
had said and proved that it is not the sun that moves around the earth;
On the contrary, it is the earth that moves around the sun. If the earth
moves around the sun, then the sun is the center. He said,'I can admit
that I have committed a mistake, and I confess, but there is one thing I
must tell: whether I confess, whether I admit it or not, makes no
difference. The earth moves around the sun. It will not change its
course just because Galileo asks to be forgiven. You can kill me, and I
am ready to ask to be forgiven. I am ready to admit that I have
committed a mistake, but my admission is not going to help; the earth
will go on moving around the sun, the earth is not at the center.'</p><p>Why was the church so adamant? There was reason in it, very, very
significant reason in it: once earth is not at the center, man is not at
the center. Then you disappear in a vast universe. In fact, religious
people should have been in favor of it because they had been against
ego. But then religious people, really religious people, are very rare
and few.</p><p>The whole effort of religion is how to drop the ego. The whole effort
is how to penetrate into the phenomenon of the ego and to SEE the
unreality of it.</p><p>I It is unreal, and I know your suffering is real. The unreal can
cause a real suffering; there is not a problem in it. Because the unreal
becomes almost real when you believe in it -- you believe in a ghost,
then the ghost is there.</p><p>In my town, just near my house there was a very old tree. My window
was just</p><p>near the tree, and I didn't like people walking, coming and going, so
I spread a rumor that there was a ghost. By and by, it became a reality.
First people laughed, but even in their laughter there was fear.</p><p>I had an old servant, so I told him one day to just sit in the tree,
and when people passed by, to just create noise. The whole town
recognized the fact that this was the truth. My family knew that I
wanted absolute silence near that tree so that nobody would pass. But by
and by, they also became afraid -- 'Who knows?' I told them,'You know
that this is just a trick!' But they said,'When the whole town believes,
and nobody walks on that path in the night, and even in the day people
are afraid... who knows?'</p><p>Once you believe, the unreal thing becomes real. Your belief makes it
real: then it hurts, then it hurts almost as if it were real. It is only
a question of belief. Man is a believing animal. Whatsoever you believe,
you make it real by your belief And you can come to know the reality
only when you drop all beliefs.</p><p>Remember, you can face reality only when you drop all beliefs, all
conceptions about it, and you come naked, nude and empty; carrying no
philosophy, no belief, nothing -- not even the belief that'I am'. That
too is a belief. Just come empty, innocent, not knowing anything, and
then the mystery will be revealed to you; not before it. And the ego is
one of the most unreal things; but one wants to believe in it, one wants
to be someone. To be nobody needs much courage. To be a nothingness
needs infinite daring. Only a Buddha or a Jesus -- rare human beings --
come to realize that emptiness. And through that emptiness is realized
the fullness of life.</p><p>The second question:</p><p>Question 2</p><p>SOMETIMES I FEEL I DON'T EXIST. WHEN I COME INTO A ROOM, NO ONE</p><p>SEES ME. WHEN I SPEAK, NO ONE HEARS. WHEN A FRIEND TOUCHES</p><p>ME, I AM NOT SOLID. I FEEL LIKE A PIECE OF QUICKSILVER THAT RUNS</p><p>AWAY FROM BETWEEN YOUR FINGERS. HOW CAN I LOSE MYSELF IF</p><p>I AM NOT THERE?</p><p>It is a very basic question. It has to be understood in many
steps.</p><p>First: nobody can see you except yourself, because the others can see
only. your periphery, not you. They can see your body: they can see your
eyes, your face, but not you. You are hidden deep behind. These are all
curtains; these are all like clouds. Your light, your flame of life, is
hidden deep behind. Nobody can penetrate it, you are impenetrable.</p><p>Except you, nobody can see you. Except you, nobody can touch you.
Except you, nobody can feel who you are.</p><p>People can move around and around you, just on the periphery; nobody
can reach to the center. Neither can you reach to anybody else's center.
The innermost core is absolutely private. Even lovers cannot penetrate
it. Deep in love, still you cannot penetrate it.</p><p>That is the misery of lovers: they would like to penetrate each
other, they would like to go as far as possible, they would like to meet
and mingle and become one, and all efforts fail. Whatsoever they do,
they find that it doesn't succeed.</p><p>Somewhere they remain two. Somewhere the separateness remains. They
can forget that they are separate, but they cannot become one.</p><p>That is the misery of love, the suffering, the anguish, because love
would like to become one. Love would like to lose all separateness, all
boundaries. But again and again; one comes to the boundary, the
limitation.</p><p>So, this is the first basic fact to understand: that except for
yourself, nobody can penetrate your privacy. That is the difference
between a rock and you. The rock can be penetrated to the very center;
it has no privacy. That is the difference between matter and
consciousness.</p><p>Matter has no privacy; consciousness has privacy. Matter can be
understood from the outside because matter has no inside. There is
nothing like inner in matter; everything is outer. And in consciousness,
just the opposite is the case: everything is inner and nothing is
outer</p><p>Consciousness is an infinite inwardness.</p><p>Consciousness is depth, matter is surface. Matter is like the waves
on the ocean; you, consciousness, you are the depth of the ocean. And
this inwardness can never be penetrated because once it is penetrated it
becomes a public thing; it becomes an object. It is no more inward, it
becomes outward. If somebody can see you, you are reduced to an object,
to a thing. You are not a man then. Try to understand this. That's why
whenever somebody looks at you, stares at you, you feel uneasy.</p><p>In Hindi we call that type of man LUCHA. The word means: one who
stares at you. The word LUCHA comes from LOCHAN; LOCHAN means: the eye.
One who goes on staring at you, goes on staring at you, is violating, is
trespassing. He is not civilized. He is incivil, uncultured.</p><p>There is a certain limit, a time limit: psychologists have come to
discover that it is near about three seconds. If for three seconds you
look at somebody there is no problem, it is just a casual look. Two
strangers can look at each other passing on the road for three seconds.
Up to that time, it is a casual look. If it is longer than that, then
the look becomes not casual. Now you are trying to penetrate the other
person. If you love the person it can be allowed, because lovers are
open to each other. But if you don't love the person and the person
doesn't love you, then you are offending. Then this is violence. Then
you are trespassing on the privacy of the other person, and the other
person will feel offended, will feel uneasy. He will retaliate. Why? --
watch: you are sitting alone in your room; you are totally a different
person. Then somebody comes in; you immediately change because two eyes
have come. You are no more in private. You are taking your bath in the
bathroom, humming, making faces in the mirror, and then suddenly you
become aware that somebody is looking through the keyhole; you change.
That gaze, that look penetrates you like a sharp sword. You are no more
-- the humming stops --</p><p>your privacy has been violated.</p><p>Why do you feel offended if somebody is looking through the keyhole?
--</p><p>because you have been reduced to a thing. Your subjectivity has not
been respected. You are not a thing. Your permission should be asked
before somebody looks at you. Without your permission, somebody looking
at you like a thief is offending you. He is creating a thing out of you.
You are a consciousness, a subjectivity. You cannot be reduced to a
thing.</p><p>Wherever you feel that you are reduced to a thing, you don't feel
free, you don't feel good, you don't feel happy. You feel very, very
suppressed. That's the misery in being a slave, or being a servant. You
are reading a newspaper, sitting in your room; your servant passes by --
you don't even look at him, you don't even recognize that a man has
passed. It is as if a robot has passed, a mechanism, not a man. You
don't say hello, you don't say good morning. Nothing is needed, he is a
servant. You treat the man as if he had no inwardness, he is just
outside, a servant. A servant is a role; it is not his being. He feels
-- it hurts that he has been taken as a thing.</p><p>You go to a prostitute: you pay because you will make love to her,
she feels hurt because she is not a commodity-but you reduce her to a
commodity. Life somehow has forced her to be a thing in the market. Even
the ugliest woman is more beautiful than the most beautiful prostitute,
because to be a woman and not to be a thing gives a grace, a dignity.
Even the most beautiful prostitute is ugly. And people who go to her
must be people who don't have any aesthetic sense. How can you make love
to a woman if you have reduced her first to be a thing? You are making
love to a dummy. You are making love to a dead body, a corpse. You are
making love to your money. You are not making love to a person, because
a person is an inwardness, and a person cannot be purchased.</p><p>Always watch around yourself, and you will see that the person is
elusive. You can catch hold of the body, but not the soul. Nobody can do
that.</p><p>The question is,'Sometimes I feel I don't exist. When I come into a
room no one sees me' -- no one CAN see you. Just because nobody can see
you, don't think that you are not. In fact, the vice-versa would have
been a curse: if people could see you, you would be a thing, a chair, a
rock.</p><p>Feel blessed that nobody can see you, howsoever they try. Even if
they brought magnifying glasses they could not see you. You are elusive
-- this is your subjectivity, this is your soul, this is your dignity.
This is the beauty and the mystery of life: that nobody can see you
except you. This is your privacy.</p><p>Beautiful is the world, because at least one thing is private -- your
own consciousness. Otherwise everything would be sold in the
marketplace. It cannot be objectified. That's what the Upanishads say:
The knower cannot be known; the seer cannot be seen. The knower can feel
himself, the seer can see himself.</p><p>Secondly: because you cannot be seen by others, how can you ask that
God should be seen by you? Even a human being has such a privacy deep
within him that nobody can penetrate it, so what to say about God?</p><p>People come to me and they say,'Tell us how to see God' -- foolish
people. They think that they are very, very intelligent and they are
asking a very intelligent question. Not even human consciousness has
ever been seen; how can you see the consciousness of the whole? You can
become one with it, but cannot see. You can dissolve in it, but you
cannot see it.</p><p>l have heard an anecdote: When Yuri Gagarin came back from space,
many questions were asked of him. One of those questions was,'Did you
meet God in space?' Yuri Gagarin is reported to have said,'I have been
out in space and didn't see God; therefore, there is no God.' Now these
words are emblazoned on the walls of the anti-God museum in Leningrad.
On the very gate; in gold letters, these words are emblazoned: I have
been out in space and didn't see God; therefore, there is no God.</p><p>The first thing that Yuri Gagarin should ask is -- can HE be seen?
Has anybody ever seen Yuri Gagarin's privacy, his innermost soul? God is
not in outer space, because God is not matter. God is in the inner space
because God is absolute consciousness. Man is partial consciousness;
even that cannot be seen, so what to say about the total, about the
whole?</p><p>Just because you cannot be seen, don't think that you are not. You
are, but you are not an object. You are subjectivity. You are the seer,
not the seen. You see, but you cannot be seen. Your nature is to be a
seer, a witness; your nature is not to be an object.</p><p>'When I speak, no one hears. When a friend touches me, I am not
solid.'</p><p>Nobody can touch you. All that can be touched is not you. And I know
-- that which can be touched is not solid at all. The body is flowing,
continuously flowing.</p><p>Ask the physiologists. They say that within seven years the body
becomes completely new. Not even a single cell remains old. It is a
river-like flow, continuously flowing. It looks solid, just the wall
looks solid, but it is not. All the physicists say that the wall is in
flux. The atoms are running at the same speed as light, moving
continuously. The movement is so fast and the speed is so</p><p>tremendous that you cannot see the movement. You cannot see the
speed, and the wall appears to be solid.</p><p>Your body is a continuous flux -- like a river it is flowing. But the
flux is so fast that you cannot see. And you think that it is
substantial, solid -- it is not. Neither is your mind solid: thoughts
are continuously moving. Like clouds, forms come and disappear.</p><p>But you? -- you are not a flux, you are not a changing phenomenon.
You are eternity. I am not saying that you are solid. You are neither
solid nor liquid; you transcend all categories. You are just space,
tremendous emptiness. And out of that emptiness all of these flowers
flower.</p><p>You are flowers of emptiness, forms of nothingness.</p><p>That's what we mean when we say,'God has no form, but you are all His
forms.</p><p>God has no names, but all names belong to Him.' The formless descends
into millions of forms, and the nameless takes millions of names.</p><p>Nobody can touch you, nobody can see you, nobody can hear you;
because all these hearings, seeings, touchings -- they belong to the
body, not to you. You are always the elusive, that which eludes; the
mysterious, the unknown and the unknowable.</p><p>But because of this, don't start feeling that you are not. You are,
but you are subjectivity, irreducible to an object. This is the whole
effort of meditation: to bring you to the point where you can fall into
your own subjectivity, where you can disappear into your own depth,
where you can come to realize that which is abiding in you -- unborn,
undying, eternal.</p><p>'How can I lose myself if I am not here?' -- just to understand this
is to lose. The'I'</p><p>that you think you are is not you; and the you that you are, you have
not even thought about. The'I' that you think you are is the'I' that is
seen by others, touched by others, heard by others, loved by others,
hated by others. The'I', the ego, is nothing but the opinions of others
that you have gathered about yourself.</p><p>This'I' you are not, but you are identified with it. You are that'I'
which has never</p><p>been seen by anybody, which has never been touched by anybody.
Uncorrupted, untouched, uncontaminated, virgin, absolutely pure, purity
itself; that you are.</p><p>Drop that which you are not so that you can know that which you are.
My whole teaching is: just to drop that which you are not. It looks
paradoxical. I am telling you to renounce that which you don't have.
Throw away that which you don't have so that which you are can become
manifested to you, can be revealed to you.</p><p>The third question:</p><p>Question 3</p><p>WHEN I WORKED WITH GURDJIEFF PEOPLE, THEY TOLD ME TO MAKE</p><p>AN EFFORT, STRUGGLE, WORK. WHEN I WORKED WITH BUDDHIST</p><p>MASTERS, THEY TOLD ME NOT TO TO, JUST SIT. YOU SAY BOTH. I FIND</p><p>THAT AT TIMES I'M CONFUSED.</p><p>Yes. I say both, and I can understand your confusion.</p><p>Gurdjieff follows the path of will. He says,'Bring tremendous effort
-- to the very climax, so that you can become crystallized. Struggle
hard, make all the efforts that you can.'</p><p>If you go to Zen Masters, Buddhists, they believe in effortlessness,
they believe in surrender. They don't believe in struggle. They
say,'Drop all efforts. Just sit silently, don't do anything: non-doing.
Someday it will happen; because it cannot be done, it happens.'</p><p>Both are clear-cut. If you follow Gurdjieff, you are against Zen
people. If you follow Zen, you are against Gurdjieff. Things are
clear-cut, logical. With me, confusion is bound to be there, because I
say both. I say work hard. I say bring your total energy into effort so
that one day effort can be dropped and you can become effortless. To me,
will brings you to Surrender, and effort brings you to effortlessness.
Let me give you a few examples, then it will be possible for you</p><p>to understand.</p><p>Lin Chi, a great Zen Master, worked with his own Master for years.
The Master taught him painting; through painting he was teaching him
meditation. For twelve years, Lin Chi worked. Then he became perfect, he
became the greatest painter. Then the Master said,'Now, your effort is
complete. Now throw these brushes, these colors, these paintings, and
forget all about painting.'</p><p>Twelve years' effort, day and night; and this Master was a hard
taskmaster. After such effort, arduous hardship, something had been
attained; and then the Master said,'Throw it away.' The Master has to be
followed; Lin Chi threw the brushes, the ink, the paintings, and forgot
all about it.</p><p>Six years passed and then the Master said,'Now you can start
painting.' Lin Chi asked,'What is the meaning of it?'</p><p>The Master said,'Now you have attained to effortless effort.'</p><p>First, one has to learn effort. Then one has to learn effortlessness.
If in your art your art is present, then it is not great art. If you
paint and effort is present, you are not a great master yet because the
very effort shows that you are not one when you are painting. If you
sing and in singing effort is present, then you are not a great singer.
You are still trying hard to prove something. When you have really
become a great singer, effort drops; you sing spontaneously. Your
singing becomes like the singing of the birds; your singing becomes
spontaneous.</p><p>The great musician is one who can touch, who can play on his organ
not knowing what he is going to do. He himself is surprised when
something happens. Not only is the audience the audience, he himself is
part of the audience. The great master becomes a vehicle, surrendered.
But to attain to that surrender, you have to purify yourself.</p><p>Tremendous effort is needed before you can become capable of dropping
it. If you want to offer your will to God -- that is what surrender is
-- first make it worthy. With ugly egos, stinking, you go to God and you
want to offer it. Go with flowers. Let yourself become a flower, a
fragrance first, and then.… If you just go and sit what do you think --
that something is going to happen? Nothing will happen; the market will
go on moving in the mind. You can -go on sitting like a statue,
dead.</p><p>When Bokuju reached his Master, the Master asked,'For what have you
come?'</p><p>He said,'Get out! We have one thousand dead Buddhas already here.'
Because he used to live in a temple which had one thousand stone
Buddhas. He said,'Get out immediately! The place is already much too
crowded with Buddhas. We don't need any more.'</p><p>What was he saying? He was saying,'You will be a stone Buddha if you
just sit.'</p><p>You can learn the posture, you can learn the trick of sitting for
hours, but what will happen to your mind? You may be sitting in a temple
but you will not be there, you will be somewhere else. You are always
there where your desire is.</p><p>To drop effort, you will have to learn what effort is. Gurdjieff is
the beginning; Zen is the end. Gurdjieff is the ABCD; Zen is the XYZ.
You can reach to Zen only if you have passed Gurdjieff. If you try to
reach directly to Zen, you will never reach.</p><p>This is what is happening in the West now. Zen has been absolutely
misunderstood. Go to Japan and see the Japanese monasteries: a Zen monk
has to work hard for twenty years, twenty-four years, even thirty years.
He has to meditate six hours, eight hours, ten hours, twelve hours, even
eighteen hours per day. Then comes a moment when the Master says,'Now
relax.' Only at the peak is relaxation allowed.</p><p>In the West, Zen has been very, very misunderstood. It is very easy
to misunderstand Zen because the language is so poetic. The language is
so paradoxical that in the West, a hippie-type Zen has come into
existence.'There is nothing to do,' Zen people say. There is nowhere to
go,' Zen people say. It fits perfectly with your laziness.</p><p>You sit, you be lazy; not doing anything, not going anywhere -- you
will not become a Buddha. Buddha himself worked hard for six years in
his last life. If you count his past lives, then for millions of lives
he had been working hard. But in his last life, when he became
enlightened, he also worked very hard. Then one day he dropped -- he
became enlightened. When people asked,'How did you attain?' he said,'By
dropping all effort.' He's true, but he can be misunderstood.</p><p>First, you need effort to drop it one day. You don't have effort yet;
how can you drop it? If you want to sit silently, you will have to run
for miles and miles, and</p><p>only then can you sit silently. To drop thinking you will have to
think for miles and miles and miles; only then can you understand the
futility of it all. In that understanding, thinking stops.</p><p>So I may appear confusing to you; that is your misunderstanding. I am
simply making it a whole. Gurdjieff is half -- just technique, just
work. Zen is also misunderstood and has become half because of the
misunderstanding -- doing nothing. I teach you to do, to do much, so
that one day you can attain to the flower of non-doing. You can simply
sit not doing anything, not even meditating.</p><p>There is the reality -- when you are not doing anything and all the
ripples of the mind have subsided, and your whole being is simply
silent. This is not laziness.</p><p>This is tremendous energy; unmotivated, not going anywhere. It is a
reservoir of energy, not laziness. You are full of energy, tremendously
at the peak of energy, but not going anywhere because there is no goal
to reach, nothing to achieve, no desire left. Not even is God a desire
now. Not even is MOKSHA, NIRVANA, the final attainment, a desire now.
All desires have left; one is sitting at home.</p><p>In that moment, the whole comes to you. The whole existence caves in
upon you from every direction and every dimension. You are accepted. You
become a.lotus flower. Without any effort, you just float on the water.
The water does not touch you, cannot touch you. You remain in the world
and not of the world.</p><p>I teach you both effort and effortlessness, because unless you attain
to effortless- effort, unless you attain to active passivity, unless you
attain to a singing-silence</p><p>-</p><p>- they look paradoxical -- unless you attain to an unmoving dance,
you have not attained.</p><p>So please don't misinterpret it as confusion. What I am saying to you
is a mystery. If you look at it logically, it will look like confusion.
If you look at it through love, it will look a mystery. It is a mystery;
you only need to have a look through love. Then you will immediately
understand, and then you will connect the polarity, and you will see
that much activity is needed to attain to passivity.</p><p>The fourth question: Question 4</p><p>IT HAS BEEN A YEAR NOW SINCE I HAVE TAKEN SANNYAS, BUT WHEN I HEAR
YOU DESCRIBE WHAT A SANNYASIN IS, I DON'T FEEL LIKE ONE.</p><p>This is how a sannyasin is always expected to feel. Once you feel
that you have arrived, you have already gone astray. The very feeling
that one has arrived is.</p><p>egoistic. One goes on learning and learning and learning, and it
never becomes knowledge. One goes on moving and moving, one comes closer
and closer to the goal, but the goal is never achieved because the goal
is infinite -- it cannot be achieved, you cannot grab it.</p><p>If you are a real sannyasin, you will always be aware that much has
to be done yet. You will never be satisfied. Life is so vast; only
mediocre minds become satisfied. Life is so big; only small minds can
think that they have attained. The more you understand, the more you
will see that you don't understand. The more you know, the more you will
know that you don't know. The ultimate of knowledge is to become as
ignorant as a small child, not knowing anything. In that innocence is
the goal.</p><p>Remain always discontented; then you grow. Then growth knows no
limits. To become a God is to go on growing. God is not a thing, it is
an on-going process. It is infinite movement. To become a God means: to
realize that the existence goes on and on. It is a continuous discovery
of new continents of being. And being is infinite, so it is not going to
end any day. It is never going to end.</p><p>The journey starts, but never ends. The sixth question:</p><p>Question 5</p><p>DAY BY DAY, NEAR YOU, I FIND MYSELF LIKING MY SADNESS. WHAT IS</p><p>HAPPENING TO ME, OSHO?</p><p>That's how it should be. If you can like your sadness also, then the
sadness is no longer sad. The sadness is sad because you dislike it. The
sadness is sad because you would not like to be in it. The sadness is
sad because you reject it. Even</p><p>sadness becomes a flowering of tremendous beauty, of silence, of
depth, if you like it. Nothing is wrong; that's what I want you to be:
to like everything that happens, even sadness. Even death has to be
loved; only then will you transcend death. If you can accept death, love
and welcome it, now death cannot kill you; you have transcended it.</p><p>When sadness comes, accept it. Listen to its song. It has something
to give to you.</p><p>It has a gift which no happiness can give to you, only sadness can
give it.</p><p>Happiness is always shallow; sadness, always deep. Happiness is like
a wave, sadness is like the innermost depth of an ocean. In sadness you
remain with yourself, left alone. In happiness you start moving with
people, you start sharing In sadness you close your eyes; you delve deep
within yourself. Sadness has a song -- a very deep phenomenon is
sadness. Accept it. Enjoy it. Taste it without any rejection, and you
will see that it brings many gifts to you which no happiness can ever
bring.</p><p>And if you can accept sadness, it is no more sadness. You have
brought a new quality to it. You will grow through it. Now it will not
be a stone, a rock on the path blocking the way; it will become a
step.</p><p>And remember always: a person who has not known deep sadness is a
poor person. He will never have an inner richness. A person who has
lived always happy, smiling, shallow, has not entered into the innermost
temple of his being.</p><p>He has missed the innermost shrine.</p><p>Remain capable of moving with all the polarities. When sadness comes,
be REALLY sad. Don't try to escape from it -- allow it, cooperate with
it. Let it dissolve in you and you be dissolved in it. Become one with
it. Be really sad: no resistance, no conflict, no struggle. When
happiness comes, be happy: dance, be ecstatic. When happiness comes,
don't try to cling to it. Don't say that it should remain always and
always; that is the way to miss it. When sadness comes, don't say,'Don't
come to me,' or,'If you have come, please go soon.' That is the way to
miss it.</p><p>Don't reject sadness and don't cling to happiness. and soon you will
understand that happiness and sadness are two aspects of the same coin.
Then you will see</p><p>that happiness also has a sadness in it, and sadness also has a
happiness in it.</p><p>Then your inner being is enriched. Then you can enjoy everything: the
morning and the evening also, the sunlight and the dark night also, the
day and the night, the summer and the winter, life and death -- you can
enjoy all.</p><p>When you don't have a choice, you are already transcendental. You
have transcended. Then the duality doesn't divide you. You remain
undivided. And this is ADWAIT; this is what Shankara means when he says
'non-dualism'; this is what the Upanishads teach: to be non-dual, to be
one.</p><p>To be one means not to choose, because once you choose your choice
divides you. You say,'I would like to be happy, and I don't want to be
unhappy'; you are divided. You simply say,'Whatsoever happens,
everything is welcome. My doors are open. Sadness comes; come be my
guest. Happiness comes; come be my guest. I will be a host to
everything, with no rejection, with no choice, with no like, no
dislike.'</p><p>Suddenly, nobody can divide you. You have attained to an inner unity,
to an inner melody, to an inner music, an inner harmony.</p><p>The seventh question:</p><p>Question 6</p><p>LOVE IS THE POINT. WHEN YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT LOVE, I FEEL LIKE</p><p>I AM FACING A GUN. MAY I CALL YOU MY GANGSTER OF LOVE?</p><p>Exactly, that's what I am. And you are facing a gun; you are facing
death.</p><p>To face love is to face death, because one who is not ready to die,
to die to the ego, will not be capable of love. And you are not
imprisoned by anybody else; it is your own ego, a false notion of
yourself which is imprisoning you. Drop it! --</p><p>and the whole existence with all its beauty becomes available to
you.</p><p>I will tell you one story. It happened: A man fell heir to some
property near the seashore. He wandered for a while in quiet enjoyment
of his land, then decided</p><p>to stroll down to the ocean. With the pleasant anticipation of
sighting waves and</p><p>-- sand, he followed the downward path, but he came to a sudden halt
as a tall wall blocked his; path. With disappointment, he reflected to
himself, -- 'Someone does not want me to trespass on his property. Well,
it is his wall. There is nothing I can do.'</p><p>Over the days, he felt a mounting urge to have direct access to the
sea. He made up his mind to locate the owner of the frustrating wall.
Checking land records, he identified the wall's owner. He then knew who
blocked his path, and who could therefore open the way. The wall was on
his own property; it was his own.</p><p>We block our own path; we can unblock ourselves.</p><p>Nobody is barring your path. You are heir to infinite possibilities.
You are walling your own path blocking your own path. So whenever I talk
about love, of course, you immediately become aware of the wall that
surrounds you.</p><p>Whenever I talk about love, you become aware of your imprisonment,
naturally.</p><p>Whenever I talk about freedom, if you are a prisoner you become aware
of your prison. And you don't like that, because every time freedom is
talked about you become aware that you are a prisoner. That you don't
like. People in the prison don't like to talk about freedom. That
hurts.</p><p>Love is absolute freedom; it is freedom of consciousness. Love knows
no bounds, no boundaries. And unless you drop all boundaries, you will
not be able to know love. Love is another name for God, and a better
name, because the name'God'</p><p>has been corrupted by the religious people. It has already become a
commodity in the marketplace. Love is another name for God, and I say, a
better one.</p><p>And your feeling is right: that whenever I talk about it, you feel as
if you are facing a gun. You are facing it; don't try to escape. Accept
the death in love, accept surrender, trust. Because as you are, you 're
just a beggar. I would like you to be emperors. Only lovers are
emperors, nobody else.</p><p>But for that, you will have to pay a price. It is nothing in fact:
the price is to drop the ego.</p><p>The eighth question:</p><p>Question 7</p><p>I HAVE IMBIBED MUCH OF YOUR GRACE BY WAY OF SHAKTIPAT, BUT</p><p>AMIDST ATTRACTION AND DISTRACTION, I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO</p><p>RETAIN IT. DOES THE VICIOUS CIRCLE OF GAIN AND LOSS</p><p>CONTINUOUSLY GO ON? UNDER SUCH A PLIGHT, IT HAS BECOME VERY</p><p>DIFFICULT TO TAKE A JUMP. UNLESS YOU VIRTUALLY PULL ME OUT OF</p><p>THE GRAVITY OF EGO, THE FINAL ENLIGHTENMENT SEEMS TO BE
IMPOSSIBLE.</p><p>The final enlightenment can never be forced by anybody on you. It is
your freedom to choose it or reject it. At the most, I can give you an
invitation; nothing more can be done. And the whole problem is that you
are not surrendering. On the contrary, you are trying to use me; and
these two things are totally different.</p><p>When you surrender, you surrender. Then you don't bother about the
final enlightenment. Then you say,'Whatsoever happens is good' If you
want to use me, then you are always worried:'The enlightenment is not
happening, the SAMADHI is not happening'; this is not happening, that is
not happening. And then, by and by, you start feeling a certain grudge,
a complaint against me, as if I am not pulling you out. Nobody can pull
you out; only you can jump out of it. In the first place, nobody has
forced and placed you there. You have entered into it, and you will have
to come out of it. I can give you a hand, but you will have to hold my
hand. In fact, my hand will not bring you out; that will be just an
excuse.</p><p>I will tell you one story.</p><p>A Quaker put a sign on a vacant piece of ground next to his home.'I
will give this to anyone who is really satisfied.' A wealthy farmer read
it as he rode by.</p><p>Stopping, he said,'Since my Quaker friend is going to give that lot
away, I may as well have it as anyone else. I am rich, I have all I
need, so I am able to qualify.' He went up to the door and explained why
he had come.'And is thee really satisfied?' asked the Quaker.'Yes, I
have all I need and am well satisfied.''Friend,'</p><p>rejoined the Quaker,'if thee is satisfied, what does thee want with
my lot?'</p><p>If something is really happening to you, if you feel that through
SHAKTIPAT</p><p>something is happening to you by being near me, then you will forget
all about final enlightenment. Because, even that much is too much. You
will feel grateful for it. You will not ask more. You will say,'I was
not worthy even of this. I am grateful.' And if you can feel that, more
will become possible; because one who feels grateful becomes capable of
achieving more, attracting more.</p><p>Through gratefulness you attract grace. Gratefulness is the magnetic
force that brings grace to you, but you don't seem to be satisfied with
it. In fact, the same questioner has been asking many questions about
final enlightenment again and again. I have not been answering, because
those questions are meaningless.</p><p>Be here and now in this moment with me, and forget about the future.
If you can be here and now, totally with me, happy, grateful, the future
is bound to come of its own accord. Enlightenment comes; nobody can
bring it. You just be ready.</p><p>Open your doors, windows; the wind will blow and the wind will bring
many fragrances; the sun will come and the sunrays will enter into the
darkest corner of your house. Nobody can bring those winds, nobody can
bring the sunrays.</p><p>You can simply remain open, that's all. Being open is all.</p><p>And remember the human tendency, the tendency of the human mind, that
first it clings to worldly things: money, power, prestige; then it
leaves them, frustrated. Then it starts clinging to God, SAMADHI,
enlightenment, MOKSHA; but the mind is the same.</p><p>All clinging must go. All desire must disappear. Only in a desireless
moment, that for which you are asking. happens -- but only in a
desireless moment.</p><p>People come to me and they say,'Teach us how to be desireless.' Now
they are desiring desirelessness, which is foolish, which is not
possible. You cannot desire desirelessness. You can simply understand
the futility of desire -- that it leads nowhere. Understanding it, it
drops. Suddenly you are desireless.</p><p>Let me tell you a story, a very famous and very old story.</p><p>BHAGAWAT PUBRANA tells the story of a crow who was flying with a
piece of meat in its beak. Twenty crows were pressing it, pursuing it,
fighting with it, trying to grab the meat. Flying high to escape them,
it became tired, wounded.</p><p>Suddenly, it dropped the meat, and the twenty crows flew down
shrieking, fighting for it. Then the crow, flying high, thought,'How
good it is to carry nothing. The whole sky belongs to me.'</p><p>He was just carrying a piece of meat in his mouth, and that piece of
meat was creating the whole trouble: twenty crows were fighting, hurting
him, trying to grab the piece of meat. Once the piece dropped, those
fighters all went away. The crow was left alone. And beautiful is the
sentence: The whole sky belongs to me.</p><p>Once desires disappear, the meat of desire is dropped, the whole sky
belongs to you. That is the meaning of enlightenment. Enlightenment is
not a thing, it is the infinite space, without desire.…</p><p>The whole sky belongs to you. <strong>Come Follow To You, Vol 4

JESUS, HE DELIVERED HIM TO BE CRUCIFIED.</p><p>46 AND ABOUT THE NINTH HOUR JESUS CRIED OUT WITH A LOUD VOICE,
SAYING: ELI, ELI, LAMASABACHTHANI? THAT IS TO SAY: MY GOD, MY GOD, WHY
HAST THOU FORSAKEN ME?</p><p>47 SOME OF THEM THAT STOOD THERE, WHEN THEY HEARD THAT SAID: THIS MAN
CALLETH FOR ELIAS.</p><p>48 AND STRAIGHTWAY ONE OF THEM RAN AND TOOK A SPONGE AND</p><p>FILLED IT WITH VINEGAR AND PUT IT ON A REED, AND GAVE HIM TO</p><p>DRINK.</p><p>49 THE REST SAID: LET BE. LET US SEE WHETHER ELIAS WILL COME TO</p><p>SAVE HIM.</p><p>50 JESUS, WHEN HE HAD CRIED AGAIN WITH A LOUD VOICE, YIELDED</p><p>UP THE GHOST.</p><p>51 AND BEHOLD, THE VEIL OF THE TEMPLE WAS RENT IN TWAIN FROM</p><p>THE TOP TO THE BOTTOM, AND THE EARTH DID QUAKE, AND THE ROCKS
RENT;</p><p>52 AND THE GRAVES WERE OPENED; AND MANY BODIES OF THE SAINTS</p><p>WHICH SLEPT AROSE,</p><p>53 AND CAME OUT OF THE GRAVES AFTER HIS RESURRECTION, AND WENT INTO
THE HOLY CITY, AND APPEARED UNTO MANY.</p><p>NOTHING is new under the sun, and nothing is old also. It all depends
on the mind. If the mind is old, then everything is old; if the mind is
new, then everything is new. And a new mind is a no-mind; only an old
mind is a mind.</p><p>Mind means the past, the accumulated past, the accumulated dust of
the past.</p><p>Mind is a rut, a routine. It is never new. It goes on repeating
itself: it is like a gramophone record, stuck. The needle is stuck
somewhere, and it goes on repeating the same line, the same line.
Centuries have passed, but the mind continues behaving in the same
pattern. It killed Socrates, poisoned him. It crucified Jesus, it killed
Mansur, and nothing has changed yet. If Jesus comes again, he is going
to be crucified.</p><p>I have heard a very beautiful story. It is a Sufi joke of tremendous
import: A Bektasi dervish -- Bektasi is an order of Sufis, one of the
most important orders, very revolutionary -- a Bektasi dervish
approached a certain bishop and said,'I have heard of a young man who
harangues crowds, advocates their breaking the law, claims supernatural
connections, performs miracles, and contradicts himself.'</p><p>'Enough,' said the bishop,'he shall be tried, charged with blasphemy
and upsetting public order. If he does not recant, he may be put to
death as a heretic and a corruptor. Just tell me his name and I shall
arrange his arrest.'</p><p>'I wish you could realize how impressed I am by your competence,'
said the Bektasi dervish.'His name is Jesus.'</p><p>Even Christians would kill him if he came again. It is not only that
Jews killed him; it was nothing to do with Jews. Let me repeat it: it
had nothing to do with Jews. It has something to do with the mind
itself. If he comes again, Christians will crucify him, because he will
bring again the new and the fresh; and the mind is old, and is always
afraid of the new and the fresh. He will again bring the unknown, and
the mind is the known, and the known is always apprehensive of the
unknown. He will again bring insecurity, and the mind is always in
search of security. He will bring chaos and the mind wants a
comfortable, convenient life, although a comfortable, convenient life is
not a real life -- the more comfortable, the less alive. The most
comfortable life is in the grave.</p><p>If you are alive there is inconvenience. If you are alive there are
challenges. If you are alive then every moment you have to face reality,
encounter reality. Every moment you have to be ready to change and to
move. Reality has no security and that is its beauty. Life has no
security and that is its beauty. Because there is no security, there is
adventure. Because the future is unknown, nobody</p><p>knows what is going to happen the next moment. That's why there is
challenge, growth, adventure. If you miss adventure, you miss all. If
your life is not that of an adventure, of a search into the unknown,
then you are living in vain.</p><p>Jesus, or a man like Jesus, always brings the unknown to you. He
always brings the challenge. The comfortable mind, the settled mind,
feels danger. Either Jesus will kill your mind, or you will have to kill
Jesus to save your mind. These are the only two alternatives. Either you
can go with Jesus -- then by and by you will dissolve -- or you will
have to kill Jesus before he attracts you.</p><p>Let me say it in this way: Jews killed Jesus not because he was
against them, but because deep down, they were attracted towards him --
a deep attraction, a deep magnetism. That was the only way to protect
themselves. Jews were not trying to kill him, they were simply trying to
protect themselves. This man was dangerous; he was opening a window into
adventure, He was calling them for a challenge, to go on a hazardous
journey, to a pilgrimage without any maps, on a pilgrimage which
wasuncharted. He was calling them to come to the wild sea, and they were
secure on their banks. They had made small houses of convenience, and
they were clinging to the bank. And this man went on calling them, this
man went on haunting them, this man became a constant danger.</p><p>They killed him to protect themselves. Don't be angry against them.
If you are angry against them you miss the whole point</p><p>Jesus will be killed again if he comes -- now Christians will kill
him because the same problem will arise again. Now Christianity is a
settled thing, and religion can never be a settled thing.</p><p>Religion is a continuity in revolution; a continuous revolution. It
is never a fixed thing. It is always a process, because religion is
life. A church is just a graveyard.</p><p>Dead religion becomes a church; dead religion becomes Christianity,
Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism. Alive religion is Jesus, Buddha: it has a
totally different flavor.</p><p>Christians will do the same because he again brings the wildness into
your settled world. He again brings the chaotic into your so-called
ordered life. He brings disorder, he is an anarchist. He brings anarchy.
He is a rebel who destroys all with which you feel comfortable. Why is
it so? Why is he so much against</p><p>law, order? -- because he knows a greater law, because he knows a
greater order.</p><p>Let me explain it to you. There are two types of order in the world:
one man- made, another divine. Man-made order is just a make believe. It
is not really order, it only hides disorder. Deep down the anarchy
continues. On the surface you are befooled, as if there is an order.
Just the opposite is the case with the divine order. On the surface
there is chaos, and deep down in the depths there is order. On the
surface there are great waves, and the ocean is silent deep within.</p><p>The center has a cosmos in it, and the periphery has a chaos on it.
That is divine order. The human order is chaos within, a cosmos just on
the periphery, skin deep at the most.</p><p>Jesus brings disorder, chaos, because he knows that unless your
periphery is in disorder, you will not be able to move towards your
innermost core. When your periphery is in disorder, there is no way to
go except within. When outside there is disorder and anarchy, where do
you move, where do you go, where do you search and seek for a home? --
you start moving inwards, you come to your center. When you think that
everything is okay outside, nothing is wrong, who bothers to go in? Only
when the outside life is in chaos is the inner life born. The inner life
is possible only in an outer chaos.</p><p>All great religious people are rebels; they have to be. They have to
destroy your illusion of order so that you can come to seek and search
for the real order. It is what Lao Tzu calls the Tao.'Tao' means the
real order which is not man-made, which is just part of reality,
intrinsic to it. It is not the laws that man has managed to make, but
the Law out of which man is born. Remember, there are many man-made
laws, but there is only one Law, the Tao; what Buddha calls the
DHAMMA.</p><p>Jesus brings disorder to make you alert. He is like an alarm he wants
to awake you but you feel offended. He disturbs your sleep, and maybe
you were having a beautiful dream. He disturbs your dream. You want him
not to disturb you. And yet there is a deep attraction because his call
appeals to your depth; it is from depth to depth. Your mind says no, but
your innermost being starts saying yes --</p><p>that is the fear. The Jews were not afraid of what Jesus was saying,
the Jews were afraid because they were feeling, deep down, an
attraction, a call, an appeal. By murdering Jesus they defended
themselves. They defended their own</p><p>periphery against their own center. Or, you can say, they defended
the man-made order against the God-made order. They defended the law of
Moses against the law of God Himself. That's what is meant when Jesus
says,'Moses brings law to you, I bring love.' Love is the Tao.</p><p>Have you watched? -- love is the most undisciplined and yet the most
disciplined thing in the world; the most anarchic and yet the most
disciplined thing in the world. When you love a person you don't follow
any rules; all rules are thrown overboard. When you love a person, rules
are not needed. They are needed only when you don't love a person. But
then love brings its own rule, then love brings its own order. If you
love me, then that very love brings a certain discipline. If you don't
love me, then rules are to be forced. In old Indian scriptures it is
said that whenever there is a Master, there is discipline. It is not
that he forces discipline; just his presence and the love that he
creates around him, brings its own discipline. Love has no discipline,
and yet, love and ONLY</p><p>love has the real discipline. When Jesus says,'I bring love to you,'
he means: I bring a certain discipline of the innermost being, of the
center.</p><p>But people who were the guardians of the law naturally became afraid.
They had to defend -- the society, the 'law, the discipline, the temple,
the religion -- Jesus was a danger to everything. When they started to
understand, or misunderstand Jesus, when they heard him, by and by they
became aware of certain things --</p><p>certain things which were their securities, which were their
comforts; certain things to which they were clinging and avoiding life;
certain things, like walls, prisons, in which they were hiding and
feeling safe. Jesus started shaking them out of their sleep. They could
not see who Jesus was, they could not see him directly. They could see
him only in relation to the securities which were going to be broken by
this man. He was a tremendous phenomenon, but they could see only a few
points.</p><p>And that is how it always happens. What I am saying to you, you are
not listening to its totality. Only to a few things do you listen which
are in some way related to you in some way disturb you, or in some way
console you. You don't listen to me, you listen to me in reference to
yourself. And because of that reference, everything becomes confused.
You lose clarity.</p><p>Let me tell you a story.</p><p>There is a story about a man who went to a dictionary compiler and
asked him why he was so interested in sex. The lexicographer was quite
surprised, and said,'Wherever did you get that idea?'</p><p>'From your own writings!' said the angry visitor.</p><p>'But I have only written that one dictionary. That's all of my
writing,' said the author.</p><p>'I know,' said the visitor,'and that is the book which I have
read.'</p><p>'But the book contains a hundred thousand words, and out of those I
don't suppose that more than a dozen words are about sex.'</p><p>'What are you talking about all the other words for,' said the
visitor,'when I was asking you about the words for sex!'</p><p>One hundred thousand words, but this man had read only the twelve
words about sex. He must have been a celibate, he must have been
suppressing sex. Out of a hundred thousand words, only a few words are
important to him. In fact, for other words he is almost blind; only for
those few words is he not blind.</p><p>When you read a book, you never read the book that the author has
written. You read some other book that you can read. When you listen to
me, it is not to what I am saying that you listen. You may hear what I
am saying, but you don't listen to what I am saying. You listen only to
certain things which are in a certain way relevant to your mind. Hearing
is not difficult, listening is the problem. Listening means that you
don't choose.</p><p>When Jesus, or a man like Jesus, explodes, the explosion is vast. He
brings millions of suns in him; the light is tremendous and infinite.
But you start thinking about yourself. You become worried about your own
small luxuries, comforts, conveniences -- trivia. You become afraid
about these things and you start defending yourself because this man
attracts your center. Mind is the periphery, being is the center -- this
man attracts your being. And let me tell you: when you crucify Jesus,
you crucify your own being in favor of your mind.</p><p>When you kill Jesus, you kill your own being in favor of your
periphery. When Jews killed Jesus on that day, they decided to be in
favor of the mind against their own being. Jesus was their essence. He
was the very essence, the very</p><p>flowering of their whole history. He was the very purpose of their
whole being here. But they decided -- they decided in favor of the mind,
and crucified being.'</p><p>Jesus is BEING crucified.</p><p>And this is not only an historic thing that once happened, and now
you are finished with it. It is something that is happening in every
moment of everybody's life. Remember It: you are always crucifying your
Jesus in favor of your mind. Stop that crucifixion. If you understand me
rightly, what I am saying to you, you will stop that crucifixion.</p><p>I have heard a story: An incompetent carpenter once built a creaky
house for himself, and maintained it carelessly. The roof threatened to
collapse, the floors were rough to walk upon. His neighbors warned him
of the dangers and the unattractiveness of his house, but he angrily
refused to listen because it was not only a house, it was also his
ego-trip. It was his house, and he had made it.</p><p>Whenever anybody said anything against the house, he took it as if
that man was against him.</p><p>This is how mind reacts.</p><p>Finally getting tired of unwanted advice, he placed plugs in his
ears. The warnings continued, but now the carpenter only smiled, not
hearing a word.</p><p>Inevitably, one day his house collapsed. Fortunately the man escaped
with only minor injuries. His neighbors scolded. They said,'See? We
warned you. You are punished by your own stubbornness.' The carpenter
just smiled pleasantly; he still wore his ear-plugs. Incredibly, in
spite of the disaster, the carpenter went right back to the same
foolishness.</p><p>Ego is very stubborn. Even if you feel that you have committed a
mistake, you don't realize it. You try to rationalize in a thousand and
one ways, to defend, to prove that it is not a mistake. And you again do
it, hoping that this time everything is going to be okay. This is hoping
against hope.</p><p>Incredibly, in spite of the disaster, the carpenter went right back
to the same foolishness -- he built and lived in another hazardous
house. He was again warned, but never changed his perilous way. That was
because he had, by this time, taken his ear-plugs as both a normal and
an easy way of life.</p><p>This explains the tragic life of men and women who insist on wearing
psychological ear-plugs. And remember, not only are Jews obsessed with
psychological ear-plugs, everybody on this earth is. Whenever your ego
is in danger, you stop listening. Or, you start listening to something
which is not said at all. Or, you start interpreting in favor of your
own ego. Anybody who is in search of truth has to understand these
tricks, because these tricks are the traps.</p><p>These tricks are the ways in which you will miss the path. The path
is very straight and clear, but your mind is very cunning and it goes on
creating new, illusory paths; and you go on listening to it. And you
have listened to it always and always, and always it has proved to be in
the wrong But it is your mind. You think it is you; it is your ego. Just
see the point of it.</p><p>Jesus' message was very simple in a way, straight. Anybody could have
understood it, but nobody understood it. And people became so enraged
that they killed this simple and innocent man. He had not committed any
sin. He was not a criminal, but he was treated as a criminal; not only
like a criminal, he was treated, worse than that. This is the point of
today's sutras.</p><p>Three persons were going to be killed on that day: two thieves and
Jesus. One of the thieves' name was Barabbas. Pontius Pilate was hoping
-- because that was the tradition, the convention, that the Governor
General would be allowed to forgive one person each year -- he was
hoping that the Jews would ask that Jesus be forgiven, released, and
should not be killed. But the Jews asked that Jesus be killed and
Barabbas, a criminal, be released. They treated Jesus even worse than a
criminal.</p><p>What was his crime? -- the criminal had broken only one law, or at
the most two laws; Jesus was breaking all the laws. He was not a
criminal. In fact, he had not done anything wrong, but he was dangerous.
The criminal was not dangerous; at the most he was a thief, or at the
most he may have been a murderer -- but the whole society was not at
stake, the whole society was not in danger. He may have been a
law-breaker, but he was not against law. Even people who are criminals
are for law; they feel guilty, and they know that they have done
wrong.</p><p>This man Jesus was dangerous. He had not done anything wrong, but he
was against all law.</p><p>He is for love, and against law.</p><p>A thousand and one criminals are less than this man's danger. All the
criminals together are less than the danger this man brings, because he
is destroying the very foundation of your society. Maybe your society is
nothing but a madhouse, but you think that it is your society. And this
man is destroying the very foundations.</p><p>They asked that a criminal should be forgiven, but Jesus had to be
crucified. He was the greatest criminal, and he had not committed a
crime at all! But he was bringing a revolution in the thinking of
people, he was bringing a revolution in their minds. The greatest
revolution there is, is the revolution for love and against law; because
law creates the rigidity of life, and love gives it again a melting. Law
makes your life frozen, love melts it through its warmth. Law is ugly.
Jesus was not saying,'Be unlawful.' That is where the misunderstanding
lay: he was against law, but he was not for lawlessness. He was against
law and for love. He was against law, but he was not saying to become
lawless. He was saying,'Rise above law, go beyond it; reach to the
heights of love.' Then there is no need for law -- your love will take
care. Love is enough, the law is not needed.</p><p>I have overheard two small children walking on the road. The elder
one was saying,'This is Sunday, and we should not work.' They must have
been Christian.</p><p>The younger one said,'Look at the policeman. He is working, he is on
duty. And the priest says that those who work on Sunday will not go to
heaven. What about policemen?' The elder one said,'Policemen are not
needed there.'</p><p>When love exists, law is not needed. Law is a poor substitute for
love. Jesus was giving a higher law, and he was misunderstood. People
thought he was destroying their law, their society, their structure, but
he was giving a more fluid structure.</p><p>I go on saying that I am against all character: you can misunderstand
me. You can think that I am teaching characterlessness. No, I am simply
teaching a higher character -- a character which is not rigid, a
character which is not fixed, a character which is not dead; a character
which is alive like a river, a character which flows; a character which
knows no boundaries, a character which can respond spontaneously; a
character which is not a clinging to the past but is always a response
in the present. The greatest men of character are always characterless.
Buddha and Jesus, they are lawless, characterless, unsocial,</p><p>because they bring a higher law into the world. But your eyes cannot
rise that high, and you cannot see what they bring. They bring sky to
us, and we have become so accustomed to creeping on the earth in our
small holes that we cannot see the freedom that they bring their freedom
seems risky.</p><p>It happened once: There were five fools travelling together. They
were tired.</p><p>They sat down against a tree, and all of them stretched out their
legs. They said,'What are we going to do now? We won't be able to get up
anymore. We are no longer able to tell which of those feet belong to
who.' They were really in deep trouble -- 'What are we going to do now?'
They started crying and weeping:'We will just have to stay here forever
and ever. We are stuck. Now nobody knows which legs belong to whom.'
There they were, crying and weeping, getting hungry and thirsty, and
they couldn't get up.</p><p>A man passed by, and he said,'What are you doing in there? Why are
you crying and weeping? What has happened to you, what unfortunate
accident has happened to you?'</p><p>'Well, here we are,' said the fools,'we can't get up.'</p><p>'But why can't you get up? I can't see any problem,' said the
man.'You look perfectly healthy.'</p><p>'Because we don't know which feet belong to which.'</p><p>'For goodness sakes! How much will you give me if I tell you?'</p><p>'Well, said the fools,'we will give you something, as long as you
tell us which of those feet belong to which.'</p><p>He took a big bag-needle and began to stick them with it. He stuck
one of them:'Ouch!'</p><p>'That's yours -- pull it in!'</p><p>He stuck another one:'Ouch!'</p><p>'That is yours, that one -- pull it in!'</p><p>He stuck all of them the same way until he had the very last one on
his feet.</p><p>That is the situation of humanity. The whole of humanity has been
behaving very foolishly. Somebody is needed to hit you hard, to make you
aware. And whenever somebody comes and hits you out of his compassion,
you get angry, you misunderstand him.</p><p>Jesus was hammering people on their heads to bring a certain truth
home: that nobody is imprisoning you except yourselves, that nobody has
made this mess of your life except yourself, that nobody has prepared
this trap for you -- it is you yourself. This ugly state of affairs,
this miserable state of affairs, is your own doing: that's the whole
message. But whenever somebody says,'This is your doing,' you want to
retaliate. You would like him to say that somebody else is responsible;
that saves your face. Whenever somebody says to you that only you are
responsible, you retaliate, react you become angry. You? -- how can you
be responsible? You are so wise. And to think oneself wise is the
definition of being a foolish man.</p><p>Now, the sutras:</p><p>THEN RELEASED HE BARABBAS UNTO THEM, BECAUSE THEY HAD</p><p>ASKED FOR HIM. AND WHEN HE HAD SCOURGED JESUS, HE DELIVERED</p><p>HIM TO BE CRUCIFIED.</p><p>AND ABOUT THE NINTH HOUR JESUS CRIED OUT WITH A LOUD VOICE, SAYING:
ELI, ELI, LAMASABACHTHANI? THAT IS TO SAY: MY GOD, MY</p><p>GOD, WHY HAST THOU FORSAKEN ME?</p><p>This sentence has tremendous import and has to be understood very
deeply and carefully. Whether you will be able to understand Jesus or
not, much depends on your understanding of this sentence. There are many
interpretations.</p><p>A few think that Jesus became doubtful. They think, a few
interpreters think, that he was also hoping for a miracle: that God
would descend from heaven and save him, and there would be a great
miracle. And that miracle did not happen, and he</p><p>was just on the verge of being crucified. He was put on the cross,
and he cried,'Eli, Eli! -- My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?'
-- What wrong have I done that you have forsaken me? Why have you left
me alone? Why are you not doing something to save me? Where is your
promise, where is your miracle?</p><p>No, this interpretation is wrong. Jesus is not saying anything like
that. He was not doubtful, and he was not expecting any miracle. Others
were expecting, right; the crowd was expecting right; but Jesus was not
expecting any miracle.</p><p>Because a man like Jesus knows that just to be, is the greatest
miracle; there is no greater miracle possible. Just to be is enough,
more than enough. You cannot ask for more. Just to be alive amidst so
much death, to be alive in the ocean of death is the greatest miracle.
In so much darkness, dense darkness, to be conscious and alive is all.
What more can you ask for? No, he was not waiting for any miracle.</p><p>Then why did he say,'Why hast thou forsaken me?' This happens to
everybody who comes to the last step to one who comes to the very verge
of samadhi, the very verge of enlightenment. This happens to everybody.
It is as if a river is just going to flow into the ocean -- the known is
going to meet the unknown, life is going to embrace death. It is
natural, it is absolutely natural. It is not a doubt, it is not anything
like scepticism, it is not losing trust. No, it is simply human that
before one dissolves, one has a shivering, a fear. One is being
uprooted, uprooted from life.</p><p>It is the same fear that a child feels when he is going to be born.
When the child is going to just come out of the womb, EVERY child I tell
you, says,'Eli, Eli -- my God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?' He
had a different life up to then.</p><p>Now, that whole life is being uprooted, and one never knows where one
is going.</p><p>One faces eternal abyss, one faces a bottomless abyss. One starts
trembling. That is the humanity of Jesus.</p><p>In Jesus' cry,'Eli, Eli,' the whole of humanity cried that day.
That's what is beautiful in Jesus. Buddha would not do that; he would
not cry. It is as if he had no human part in him -- all stone, marble.
Jesus is a man of flesh and bone, just like you and me; a fragile being
facing eternal abyss. It is not because of any doubt that he cried --
because if there had been doubt he would not have</p><p>said,'Eli, Eli! -- My God, my God!' He would not have said that. If
there had been doubt, he would have said the thing that Nietsche said
after twenty centuries:'God is dead. There is no God.'</p><p>If he had been waiting for any miracle, that would have been the
moment to say,'You don't exist, and I was befooled by my own illusions,
my own dreams.' If Jesus had been sceptical, he would have said,'There
is no God anymore. I was wrong to believe in you; you don't exist.' Or,
he would have challenged,'This is the point to prove whether you are or
not. NOW do the miracle and prove that you are!'</p><p>It happened to one philosopher, Edmund Burke: he went to church when
there was a congregation. He stood just before the congregation, took
out his pocket watch and said,'I will believe in God if He can stop this
watch, just now.' He looked upwards, and said,'If you are, if you exist,
please do at least this much of a miracle. This is not a big miracle I
am asking for. Stop this watch.' And the watch did not stop. It is
proved that God doesn't exist. Edmund Burke was not asking for a big
miracle, but a small miracle; very small, nothing much. But the question
is not whether you ask for a big miracle or a small miracle; the
question is: are you asking for a proof? Then the proof cannot be
supplied, because the existence is not at all concerned to prove itself
to anybody. In fact, those who try to prove that they are, are in a
certain way suspicious of their being. God is not suspicious, so
whatsoever you say, He goes on quietly, silently smiling. He does not
bother. He is, and what is the need to prove it?</p><p>Jesus was not asking for proof, otherwise he would not have said,'My
God, my God' -- God remains still 'my' -- 'why hast thou forsaken me?'
This is simple humanity, fragile humanness. Left alone, it comes to
everybody; this crucifixion comes to everybody. If you go deeper in
meditation, one day you will find the meaning of this sentence,'Eli,
Eli, lamasabachthani.' One day you will find, moving slowly, slowly,
slowly, that you come to the point where you are dissolving,
disappearing. This is the point of crucifixion, and you will also
cry,'My God, why have you forsaken me? I am disappearing, evaporating!'
It is simply an indication of fragile humanness, nothing else. And it
shows the authenticity of the experience because it happens only when
one really faces that moment of total cessation, crucifixion, where the
ego completely disappears. One is left in total emptiness. There is no
doubt in it, there is no asking for any miracle. It is not a question,
it is a statement about Jesus' humanity:'I am a fragile human being, son
of man, and I am afraid. I am trembling, and I would like to go</p><p>back.'</p><p>But there is no going back, because that is the point of no return.
So, except for crying, what else can you do?'My God, my God, why hast
thou forsaken me?'</p><p>SOME OF THEM THAT STOOD THERE, WHEN THEY HEARD THAT SAID: THIS MAN
CALLETH F OR ELIAS.</p><p>That's what I mean: whenever you hear a man like Jesus, you interpret
him in your own way. Elias is an old prophet. The people interpreted
that he was calling for Elias. He was calling for the living God, who is
now, and people thought he was calling for Elias who was sometime in the
past. The mind thinks of the past, a no-mind responds to the
present.</p><p>Jesus was calling for God who is right now, and who is always now;
who has, no past and no future, who is just present. He was, calling to
God, the present, the living, just now facing him. But people thought he
was calling to Elias, the old prophet.</p><p>SOME OF THEM THAT STOOD THERE, WHEN THEY HEARD THAT SAID: THIS MAN
CALLETH FOR ELIAS.</p><p>AND STRAIGHTWAY ONE OF THEM RAN AND TOOK A SPONGE AND</p><p>FILLED IT WITH VINEGAR AND PUT IT ON A REED, AND GAVE HIM TO</p><p>DRINK.</p><p>THE REST SAID: LET BE. LET'S SEE WHETHER ELIAS WILL COME TO SAVE</p><p>HIM.</p><p>JESUS, WHEN HE HAD CRIED AGAIN WITH A LOUD VOICE, YIELDED UP</p><p>THE GHOST.</p><p>Once more he cried,'My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?' Why
twice?</p><p>First he cried; he must have hoped that there would be an answer,
that there would be a response. Nothing happened.</p><p>Existence is silent. You hear only your echoes.</p><p>There was no answer coming from existence. He cried once more --
maybe he had not been heard? -- existence never answers. Not that it
doesn't answer; it never answers verbally, it never answers your mind.
It answers, in an existential way. It answered, but Jesus could not
follow at that moment -- at that moment, nobody is able to follow. At
that moment one simply trembles and sees earth slipping away underneath,
and sees oneself evaporating. And there is no answer coming.</p><p>Only later on, when Jesus was resurrected, could he then understand
the answer.</p><p>The answer is given in terms of existence, not in terms of intellect,
mind. It is not verbal. The answer is resurrection. Die totally, and
then you resurrect. And that was the answer:'I have not forsaken you. I
am always there deep within you; how can I forsake you? -- because I am
you. How can I forsake you? How can I go away from you? -- because I am
your innermost core. That which has died on the cross is neither you nor
I. It is just a vehicle, a house, a dream you were using.</p><p>It is neither you nor I.' And these people who had crucified Jesus,
they had crucified only the body, not the spirit. The spirit cannot be
crucified. It is immortal. But that answer will come a little later on,
when Jesus has died. He cried again:</p><p>JESUS, WHEN HE HAD CRIED AGAIN WITH A LOUD VOICE, YIELDED UP</p><p>THE GHOST.</p><p>Once more he tried to find out the answer, any response from the
whole, from the ocean. No response coming, he died, he disappeared.</p><p>This is what Buddha calls NIRVANA, the cessation of the flame. He
surrendered.</p><p>That is the meaning of 'he yielded up the ghost' -- he surrendered.
He said,'Yes,</p><p>thy will be done. Let it be so, as you will.'</p><p>AND BEHOLD, THE VEIL OF THE TEMPLE WAS RENT IN TWAIN FROM THE TOP TO
THE BOTTOM, AND THE EARTH DID QUAKE, AND THE ROCKS RENT;</p><p>A man like Jesus is the very pinnacle of consciousness, a cherished
flower. He is someone who has been coming up, coming up for centuries
after so many births, growing, growing. And then comes the flowering.
The whole existence celebrates, the whole existence feels the glory of
God. And when such a man drops dead, leaves the body, a sadness spreads
all over existence. It has to be so...</p><p>because we are not separate from each other; we are interlinked, we
are joined together. We are one mass of consciousness. Individuality is
just an egoistic notion. So whenever a Jesus flowers, the whole
existence feels the blessing; and whenever a Jesus drops his body, the
whole existence feels the sadness. These are the symbolic ways of saying
this:'And behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top
to the bottom, and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent.' It has to
be so.</p><p>It is said about Mohammed that whenever he would walk in the desert,
a cloud would follow him to give him shelter, like an umbrella. It may
not be historical, but it is significant. It is poetic, symbolic -- it
SAYS something.</p><p>It is said about Buddha that when he became enlightened, trees
flowered out of season. They may not have flowered; this may not be a
scientific statement. But a statement need not be scientific to be true,
a statement need not be historical to be true. There are planes and
planes of truth. There is a certain quality in a poetic truth also. It
is not historic, it is not scientific, but it is true all the same. It
is a POETIC truth. And a poetic truth is on a higher plane than any
scientific truth, because scientific truths go on changing; a poetic
truth is eternal. Scientific truth is more or less a fact. A poetic
truth is not a fact but a deep significance, a meaning, a myth.</p><p>It is said about Mahavir that when he would walk and move from one
village to another -- and he was nude, a naked man with no shoes, no
clothes -- sometimes thorns would be on the path: they would immediately
turn to protect his feet.</p><p>Thorns may not have done this -- one cannot expect that much from
thorns. Even from human beings it is too much to expect. But still, the
idea is significant. It simply shows one thing: that we are members of
each other. Thorns are also part of us, and we are part of thorns.
Flowers are also part of us, and we are part of flowers. We are one
family. We are not strangers, separate islands: a vast continent of
being, interrelated.</p><p>The earth may not have quaked, but I say that the gospel is true. And
whenever there is any contradiction between a poetic truth and a
scientific truth, always believe the poetic. The scientific is very
ordinary. To believe in the poetic truth is extraordinary. It gives you
vision, it raises you to a higher plane of being. Just to trust a poetic
truth, you start flying, as if suddenly wings have grown to you.</p><p>You are no longer moving on the earth, you fly in the sky. When a
truth has wings, it becomes poetic.</p><p>AND, BEHOLD, THE VEIL OF THE TEMPLE WAS RENT IN TWAIN FROM</p><p>THE TOP TO THE BOTTOM, AND THE EARTH DID QUAKE, AND THE ROCKS
RENT;</p><p>AND THE GRAVES WERE OPENED, AND MANY BODIES OF THE SAINTS</p><p>WHICH SLEPT AROSE.</p><p>Of course, it should be so. Even if it had not been so, it should
have been so.</p><p>Whenever a Jesus is crucified, all the saints of the past must feel
it in their graves; they have to feel it.</p><p>In fact, Buddha has said that whenever a Buddha is born, not only do
the past Buddhas feel it, but even the future Buddhas feel it, those who
are going to be.</p><p>Because time is a human concept, but in fact there is no time. It is
eternal. It is one whole, one piece.</p><p>AND THE GRAVES WERE OPENED, AND MANY BODIES OF THE</p><p>SAINTS</p><p>WHICH SLEPT AROSE.</p><p>Jesus being crucified was such a shock. It was such a shock, such a
sword-like, sharp penetration into the being. It was not only Jesus
crucified, it was all religion crucified that day, all saints crucified
in Jesus.</p><p>What is the meaning of it? The meaning is that the present contains
the whole past, this moment contains the whole past. Nothing disappears,
nothing CAN</p><p>disappear. Where will it go? This rose flower contains all the rose
flowers of the past; and if you can understand, let me say, it contains
all the future flowers also.</p><p>This is just one flower representing all the flowers of the past and
future. We are here; in this moment the whole existence converges. All
the past and all the future converges in this moment. This moment is the
bridge between the past and the future. In you, everything is meeting
right now. If you can become aware, then you are the whole existence
this very moment. This is the meaning of the Upanishadic saying: AHAM
BRAHMASMI -- 'I am the whole.' This is the meaning of Jesus, repeating
again and again,'I and my Father are one' -- I am the whole. This is the
meaning of el-Hillaj Mansur who said, ANA-EL-HAQQ -- 'I am the
truth.'</p><p>In each moment the whole converges. Each moment represents the whole,
the whole past and the whole future. Jesus is not only Jesus: all the
Buddhas are involved, all the saints are involved; and not only of the
past but, I say to you, of the future also.</p><p>AND THE GRAVES WERE OPENED, AND MANY BODIES OF THE SAINTS</p><p>WHICH SLEPT AROSE,</p><p>AND CAME OUT OF THE GRAVES AFTER HIS RESURRECTION, AND. WENT INTO THE
HOLY CITY AND APPEARED UNTO MANY.</p><p>And this was felt by many. It was not just written by the few
disciples. Even others who had the sensitivity felt it.</p><p>It depends on your sensitivity.</p><p>What I am saying to you this moment, if you are really sensitive, you
can feel all</p><p>-</p><p>- the whole past and the whole future converging in you. And in that
moment you are no more a tiny being, you are the whole. Those who were
sensitive, they could see it. They could feel unknown forces moving
around.</p><p>That day of Jesus' crucifixion was not an ordinary day. People who
had a little prayer in them must have felt certain unknown forces
moving. People who had a little meditation in them must have felt, must
have become perceptive. Those who had loved, or those who had a poetic
vision, or the sense of an artist, they must have felt. People who had
any quality of the heart must have felt many presences all around.</p><p>The Gospel writers were not aware of Indian scriptures, otherwise
they would have made it more clear. In India we have a very long
tradition, and we have tried through many dimensions to interpret the
unknown. When Buddha spoke, it is said that not only human beings were
present there to listen to him; gods also came, animals also, trees also
listened. If you read Buddhist scriptures you will be surprised, because
the number of listeners was so great. You must be surprised, because no
instruments existed -- how could Buddha have spoken to such great
multitudes? -- the microphone was not there, there was no way to
communicate. But there is a misunderstanding. Those numbers are not only
of human beings. The greater part of them were DEVAS, gods who had come
from above to listen to Buddha; then animals who could not understand
language, but who could feel; then trees and plants and birds; who
didn't need any verbal communication, just the very presence of Buddha
was enough nourishment to them; and THEN human beings.</p><p>Human beings were a very minor part of the whole audience. And the
same is the story about Mahavir, and about other Teerthankaras and other
Buddhas.</p><p>About Mahavir, it is said that when first he spoke, only gods could
understand and listen to him because he spoke on such a high plane that
it was impossible for anybody else to understand. Then gods persuaded
him,'Please come a little lower to help humanity.' Then, by and by, he
spoke on a lower plane and humanity could understand. Then gods
persuaded him to come still a little lower,</p><p>because animals were there, and the trees and the rocks.</p><p>These stories are beautiful. They say only one thing: that we all are
interrelated, we are not separate. The highest point is related to the
lowest. We are all rungs of one ladder -- the lowest is as much a part
of the same ladder as the highest.</p><p>Those who were sensitive must have felt unknown, strange presences
all around.</p><p>But the whole thing depends on your sensitivity; nothing else is
needed. A great intellectual attainment is not needed, a great logical
acumen is not needed. When Jesus comes to you and knocks at your door,
all that is needed is deep sensitivity.</p><p>Let me tell you a very small anecdote: A good and thoughtful king
offered a ride in his carriage to a weary traveller on the road. Having
been treated badly by evil kings, the traveller hesitantly asked,'Sir,
what must I give in return?'</p><p>The understanding king replied,'Just one thing: your acceptance of
the offer.' Yes, that's all that a Jesus asks of you -- your acceptance
of the offer.</p><h3 style=padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;line-height:192%;text-align:left id=come-follow-to-you-vol-4-chapter-10>Come Follow To You, Vol 4

title: I am the See You are Seeking 30 December 1975 am in Buddha
Hall</h3><p>The first question:</p><p>Question 1</p><p>YOU APPEAR TO DEVOTE YOUR LIFE TO HELPING OTHER PEOPLE; BUT</p><p>PEOPLE AROUND YOU APPEAR ONLY INTERESTED IN HELPING</p><p>THEMSELVES. IF THEIR AIM IS TO LOSE THEIR EGOS, IS NOT A BETTER</p><p>METHOD TO LOSE ONESELF IN HELPING OTHERS?</p><p>THIS is from a new seeker, Virginia. Because she is new, she cannot
understand what is happening here.</p><p>The first thing to remember: you can help others only when you have
helped yourself, not before it. You can help others only when you have
disappeared, not before it. You cannot lose your ego by helping others.
You can lose your ego, and THEN YOU can help others. In fact, if you
have the ego already there and you help others, you will attain to a
very cultivated, subtle, pious ego -- that's all.</p><p>Egolessness won't come through it. The ego will become religious,'and
when a poison becomes religious, it becomes more dangerous.</p><p>I am helping you because I am not. You are here to help yourself in
the first place. When you disappear, then in |fact there is no need to
help others; it happens of its own accord.</p><p>Let me tell you an anecdote: A woman always attended church, and
after each sermon would remark,'My, they certainly did need the message
this morning.'</p><p>One snowy Sunday morning, she was the only one in the congregation.
The minister delivered his message anyway. He walked with her to the
door, where she said,'My, they certainly would have needed it if they
had been here.' The message is for you. Don't play tricks with yourself;
don't start a new ego-trip. It is not for them, it is for you. I am
talking to each individual directly; I am not talking to a crowd. When I
say something, I am saying it exactly to you, not to the neighbors.</p><p>And the only way you can be of any help to the world is that you
disappear, become an emptiness. Out of that emptiness arises the flame
of love and compassion. Out of that emptiness arises a fragrance of
divineness. And then you help millions, but you never come to know that
you are helping them. You become a vehicle of God, you become an
incarnation. Before that you can become a missionary, which is a dirty
word. Before that you can become a do- gooder, which is very dangerous.
Before that you can become a very pious egoist: helping others one Feels
oneself on top of them.'Holier than thou' becomes your attitude. In your
very look there is condemnation and you cannot help anybody through
condemnation, only through compassion.</p><p>But how is compassion possible with the ego? With the ego, violence
is possible, condemnation is possible. Love and compassion? no, they are
not possible. So</p><p>please be alert. It always happens when you come near a Master and
you hear the message, that your mind starts spinning things. It
says,'THEY need it.' The whole world needs it except you. Be aware: YOU
need it. You are they.</p><p>The world is not separate from you, the world is you multiplied.</p><p>And let me say to you that I teach selfishness. I don't teach that
you should go and serve others. I teach: love yourself, serve yourself,
so that that which is hidden within you becomes manifest. The very flow
of it will help others.</p><p>Wherever you walk, whatsoever you do, will become a help. It is not
that you are trying to help; your very being will become helpful.</p><p>The second question:</p><p>Question 2</p><p>HAVING ATTAINED THE PEACEFUL STATE OF MIND WHICH YOU CALL</p><p>INDIA, HOW CAN ONE SUSTAIN IT IN THE PRESSURES OF THE WEST? FOR ME,
IT HAS BEEN IMPOSSIBLE.</p><p>Yes, I call India not a country, but an inner space. I call India not
something that exists there in geography, on the maps. I call India that
which exists hidden within you, and that which you have not yet
discovered. India is your innermost space. India is not a nation, it is
a state of mind.</p><p>The questioner asks,'Having attained the peaceful state of mind which
you call India, how can one sustain it in the pressures of the West? For
me, it has been impossible.'</p><p>Once you attain it, you cannot lose it. Even if you want to lose it,
you cannot lose it. No real attainment is ever lost. Then, you must have
imagined that you had attained to the innermost peace. Then, you must
have deceived yourself. Then, something must have given you the idea
that you had attained to it.</p><p>For example, if you go to the Himalayas, it is peaceful and silent.
Eternal silence reigns there. In that silence you start feeling silent
you reflect silence. Don't</p><p>think that you have become silent; it is the Himalayas being
reflected in you. The silence belongs to the Himalayas, not to you. When
you come down to the plains, that silence is gone. Again you are in the
turmoil, again you ARE the turmoil, again the anguish and the anxiety.
And you think you have lost something which you had gained? No, in the
first place you had never gained it. It belonged to the Himalayas; it
still belongs there. You entered a certain situation, but you didn't
enter a certain state. The situation is something outside you, the state
is something within you. And you deceived yourself. It is so easy to
deceive oneself. One wants to feel that one has attained, because that
also gives a very deep nourishment to the ego: I have attained.</p><p>Many people come to India. Coming from the West, India looks silent,
peaceful, poor but contented. India is, in a way, almost two thousand
years behind. When you come from New York to India, or from London to
the Himalayas, you are moving backwards in time. You are moving in the
times of Jesus, two thousand years back. Everything is primitive, wild,
untamed. One feels good; one feels again a certain freedom. The noise,
the anxiety, the tension, the constant hurry, the 'always going
somewhere not knowing where one is going' of the West, is not here.
Things move slowly. Everything seems to be moving nowhere, very
silently. A certain music is still present. Indians may not feel it
because they have been born to it, just as a fish never feels the ocean.
But when people from the West come, they are shocked into a certain
awareness. Their sleep is broken, and they start feeling and thinking
that they have attained to a certain state. To attain a certain state is
not so easy. It is not a plane trip: you cannot fly from one state of
mind to another state of mind. It is not a journey, it is a
pilgrimage.</p><p>And this is the distinction between a journey and a pilgrimage: a
journey is going from one point to another point in space, a pilgrimage
is going from without to within, from space to no-space. You can be
easily deceived here, not by anybody else, but by yourself.</p><p>Then you go back, and that freedom, that silence, that meditation,
that prayerfulness, is lost. Hence the question:'Having attained the
peaceful state of mind which you call India, how can one sustain it?'
There is no need to sustain it.</p><p>It is so alive, it is so vital that it sustains itself. It has
tremendous energy. It needs nobody's help. In fact, you are not needed
to sustain it; it sustains you. It is greater than you, higher than you,
deeper than you, bigger than you: it is your original nature. It is you
in your ultimate glory. Nothing is needed to sustain it,</p><p>and nothing can distract you from it. Once attained, it is attained
forever. You cannot lose it. If you lose it, then know well that you
deceived yourself.</p><p>'How can one sustain it in the pressures of the West?' If it cannot
be sustained in the pressures, it is not of worth. Any meditation that
is of worth will be alive even in the marketplace. Because a marketplace
is nothing once you attain to the meditative state. No market can
disturb it, no market can distract you away from it. It becomes like
breathing. In fact, you will feel it more in the marketplace than in the
Himalayas, because in the Himalayas the contrast will be missing. If you
have really tasted what aloneness is, you will feel it more in the crowd
than on a Himalayan peak, because in the crowd, the contrast.… If you
have listened to the inner music, you will hear it more in traffic noise
because of the contrast. In the night you can see the stars in the sky,
not in the day -- because the contrast is missing. The night is so dark;
in that velvety darkness you can see those stars, beautiful stars In the
day they did appear. They are still there where they are, they have not
gone anywhere, they remain in the sky -- but the contrast is missing
because of the sunlight. Now there is no background to them.</p><p>This, is my understanding, this is my experience: that whatsoever you
attain, you will always taste it more, feel it more; it will surface in
your being more clearly, crystal clear, whenever you move to the
contrary. If the meditation is true, in New York it will be more clear
to you, in London you will feel it more.</p><p>Surrounding yourself with the opposite, it will throb more clearly.
If it is not happening, you come to the East, you feel good, and then
you go to the West and it is gone. It has been a journey, not a
pilgrimage. You travelled from one point to another in space, you have
not travelled from space to no-space. Meditation means a pilgrimage from
the out to the in, from the without to the within. Once attained, even
if you want to lose it you cannot lose it.</p><p>The third question:</p><p>Question 3</p><p>WHEN I AM WRITING A BOOK, I AM FULL OF FLOWING ENERGY AND DELIGHT.
BUT, WHEN I HAVE FINISHED, I AM SO EMPTY AND DEAD THAT I CAN HARDLY BEAR
TO LIVE. NOW I AM MUST STARTING TO</p><p>WRITE, BUT THOUGH I CAN GET INTO THE PLEASURE WHILE I AM WORKING,
DURING THE MEDITATIONS I GET OVERWHELMED WITH FEAR OF THE EMPTINESS
WHICH I EXPECT MONTHS FROM NOW.</p><p>This is from Pankaja; she is a novelist. I have gone through her
novels, and they are beautiful. She has the knack of it: how to tell a
story beautifully, how to weave a story. And this experience is not only
hers, it is of almost everybody who is in any way creative. But still,
the interpretation is wrong, and much depends on the interpretation.</p><p>When a woman carries a child, she is full. Of course, when the child
is born, she will feel empty. She will miss the new life that was
throbbing and kicking in her womb. The child has gone out; she will feel
empty for a few days. But she can love the child, and she can forget her
emptiness in loving the child and helping the child to grow. For an
artist, even that is not possible. You paint, or you write a poem or a
novel; once it is finished you feel deep emptiness. And what can you do
with the book now? So the artist is in an even more difficult situation
than a mother. Once a book is finished, it is finished. Now it needs no
help, no love; it is not going to grow. It is perfect, it is born
grown-up. A painting is finished, it is finished. an artist feels very
empty. But, one has to look into this emptiness.</p><p>Don't say that you are exhausted; rather, say that you are spent.
Don't say that you are empty, because each emptiness also has a fullness
in it. You are looking from the wrong end.</p><p>You come into a room: there is furniture, pictures on the walls and
things. Then those things and the pictures are removed and you come into
the room: now what will you say? Will you call it empty, or will you
call it a full room?'Room'</p><p>means emptiness;'room' means space. With the furniture removed, the
room is full. When furniture was there the room was not full; much of it
was missing because of the furniture. Now the room is complete, the
emptiness is total.</p><p>You can look from two ends. If you are too furniture-oriented, so
that you can only look at the chairs and tables and the sofa and you
cannot see the roominess of the room, then it will feel empty. But if
you know, and you can see emptiness directly, you will feel a tremendous
freedom which was not there before because the room was missing; you
could not move in it. Go on filling it with furniture,</p><p>and there will come a point when you cannot move because the whole
room is gone.</p><p>Once I stayed in a very rich man's house. He was very rich, but had
no taste. His house was so full that it was not a house at all. You
could not move, and you were always afraid to move because he had
precious antiques. He himself was afraid to move. The servants were
constantly worried. He gave me the best, the most beautiful room in his
house. And I told him,'This is not a room, it is a museum. Please give
me something where I can move, then it will be a room.</p><p>This is not a room. The room has almost disappeared.' The room means:
the freedom that space gives you.</p><p>When you are working, creating, your mind is full of many things. The
mind is occupied. Writing a novel the mind is occupied; writing a poem
the mind is occupied; there is too much furniture in it -- the furniture
of the mind: thoughts, feelings, characters. Then the book is finished.
Suddenly, the furniture is gone.</p><p>You feel empty. But there is no need to become sad. If you look at it
rightly -- this is what Buddha called right-vision, SAMYAK DRASTHI -- if
you look rightly, you will feel freed of an obsession, of an occupation.
You will feel clean again, unburdened. Those characters of the novel are
no longer moving there. Those guests are gone and the host is totally at
ease. Enjoy it. Your wrong interpretation is creating sadness for you,
and fear. Enjoy it. Have you never observed that when a guest comes you
feel good; when he goes you feel even better? He leaves you alone, and
now you have your own space.</p><p>To write a novel is maddening because so many characters become
guests, and each character has his own way. It is not always that he
listens to the writer, not always. Sometimes he has his own way, and he
forces the writer in a certain direction. The writer starts the novel,
but never ends it. Then those characters end it by themselves.</p><p>It is just like giving birth to a child. You can give birth to a
child, but then the child starts moving on his own. The mother may have
been thinking that the child would become a doctor, and he becomes a
hobo. What can you do? You try-hard, but he becomes a hobo.</p><p>The same happens when you write a novel: you start with &
character -- you were going to make a saint out of him, and he becomes a
sinner. And I tell you,</p><p>it is exactly as it happens to a child: the mother is worried; the
novelist is worried.</p><p>He wanted him to become a saint and he is becoming a sinner, and
nothing can be done. He feels almost helpless, almost used by these
characters. They are his fantasies, but once you cooperate with them
they become almost real. And unless you get rid of them, you will never
be at peace. If you have a book in your mind, it has to be written to
get rid of it. It is a catharsis, it is unburdening yourself.</p><p>That's why creative people almost always go mad. Mediocrities never
go mad -- they have nothing to go mad over, they have nothing maddening
in their lives.</p><p>Creators almost always go mad. A Van Gogh will go mad, a Nijinsky
will go mad, a Nietsche will go mad. Why does it happen that they go
mad? -- because they are so occupied; so many things are happening in
the mind. They don't have a space of their own within themselves. So
many people are staying there, coming and going. It is almost as if they
are sitting on a road and the traffic continues. Each artist has to pay
for it.</p><p>Remember, when a book is finished and a child is born, feel happy,
enjoy that space, because sooner or later a new book will arise. As
leaves come out of trees, as flowers come out of trees -- exactly like
that, poems come out of a poet, novels come out of a novelist, paintings
come out of a painter, songs are born out of a singer. Nothing can be
done; they are natural.</p><p>So sometimes in the fall when the leaves have fallen and the tree
stands alone without leaves against the sky, enjoy it. Don't call it
emptiness, call it a new type of fullness -- full with yourself. There
is nobody to interfere; you are resting in yourself. That period of rest
is needed for every artist; it is a natural process.</p><p>Each mother's body needs a little rest. One child is born and another
is conceived it used to happen, it used to happen in the East, and in
India it still continues: a woman is almost old by the age of thirty,
continuously giving birth to children with no gap to recuperate, to
rejuvenate her being, to be alone. She is exhausted, tired. Her youth,
her freshness, her beauty, are gone. A rest period is needed when you
give birth to a child. You need a rest period. And if the child is going
to be a lion, then a long rest period is needed. And a lion only gives
birth to one child, because the whole being is involved in it. And then
there is a rest period, a</p><p>long rest period to recupe, to regain the energy that you have given
to the child, to regain yourself again so that something can be born out
of you.</p><p>When you write a novel, if it has been really a great piece of art,
then you will feel empty. If it has been just a sort of journalism that
you have made for money because some publisher has made a contract with
you, then, then it is not very deep. You will not feel empty after it,
you will remain the same. The deeper your creation, the greater will be
your emptiness afterwards, The greater the storm, the greater will be
the silence that comes in its wake. Enjoy it. The storm is good, enjoy
it; and the silence that follows it is also good. The day is beautiful,
full of activity; night is also very beautiful, full of inactivity,
passivity, emptiness. One sleeps. In the morning you are again back in
the world with full energy to work, to act.</p><p>Don't be afraid of the night. Many people are. There is one
sannyasin, I have given her the name Nisha.'Nisha' means: the night. She
comes to me again and again, and she says,'Please change my name.''Why?'
She says,'I am afraid of night. Why have you given me, out of so many
names, just this name? Change it.'</p><p>But I am not going to change it. I have given it to her knowingly,
because of her fear -- her fear of darkness, her fear of passivity, her
fear of relaxation, her fear of surrender. That is all indicated in the
word'night', nisha.</p><p>One has to accept the night part also. Only then do you become
complete, full, whole.</p><p>So Pankaja, don't take it amiss. That emptiness is beautiful, more
beautiful than the days of creativity, because that creativity comes out
of emptiness, those flowers come out of emptiness. enjoy that emptiness,
feel blissful and blessed.</p><p>Accept it, welcome it like a benediction, and soon you will see that
you are again full of activity, and a greater book is going to be born
again. Don't be worried about it. There is no need to worry. It is just
a misinterpretation of a beautiful phenomenon.</p><p>But man lives in words. Once you call a thing by a wrong name, you
start becoming afraid of it. Be very, very exact. Always remember what
you say, because saying is not just saying; it has deep associations in
your being. Once you call a thing emptiness, you become afraid -- the
very word.</p><p>In India, we have better words for emptiness. We call it SHUNYA. The
very word is positive; it has nothing of negativity in it. It is
beautiful. It simply means space, with no boundaries: SHUNYA. And we
have called the ultimate goal shunya. Buddha says when you become
shunya, when you become absolutely nothing, a nothingness, then you have
attained.</p><p>A poet, an artist, a painter, is on the way to becoming a mystic. All
artistic activity is on the way towards becoming religious. When you are
active, writing a poem, you are in the mind. When the poem is born you
are spent, and the mind takes rest. Use these moments to fall into your
being. Don't call it emptiness; call it wholeness, call it being, call
it truth, call it God. And then you will be able to feel the benediction
of it.</p><p>The fourth question:</p><p>Question 4</p><p>I WANT TO COME CLOSE TO YOU, OSHO, BUT I ENJOY BEING IN OPEN</p><p>SPACES AND BY THE SEA. SO WHAT TO DO?</p><p>I don't see the problem. Can you find a more open space than me? And
can you find a more wild sea than me?</p><p>I am absolute lawlessness.</p><p>There is no problem. Don't try to create a problem where none exists.
Just look into my eyes: I am the sea you are seeking, and I am the vast
empty space you have always been searching for through many of your
Lives. Now by chance, just coincidentally you are close to me. Don't
miss this opportunity. There are many ways to miss it, there is only one
way not to miss it. There are a thousand and one ways to go away from
me, there is only one way to come near me. So it is almost impossible
that you will be able to come near me, because the possibility to go
astray is more -- one thousand and one. You can find so many reasons to
go away from me, and you can justify them, you can rationalize and you
can feel perfectly right in going away from me. But to come close to me
is going to be arduous and difficult, because everybody wants freedom.
At least, everybody THINKS that they want freedom. But I rarely come
across a man who really wants freedom; he thinks he wants freedom.
Because to be free</p><p>means to be nobody. If you are somebody, that 'somebodiness' will be
your imprisonment.</p><p>To find infinite space means that you will have to dissolve. Because
you create, you go on creating your boundaries around you. To move to
the wild sea, uncharted, you will have to throw all your maps, all your
scriptures, all your religions, all your concepts and ideologies. To
move into space which has no boundaries to it, is to die: to die to the
known and to trust the unknown, which is the most difficult thing in the
world.</p><p>I will tell you one story. It is a very ancient story, and one of the
most beautiful I have ever come across.</p><p>There was a very wise king. His own prime minister committed a
betrayal: he delivered some secrets to the neighboring country, to the
enemy. The prime minister was caught red-handed. There was only one
punishment for it, and that was death. But the old king had always loved
this man. He was sentenced to death, but the old man gave him an
opportunity. The last day, he called his whole court. On one side there
was a gun ready to kill the man, on the other side there was a black
door. And the king said,'You can choose, either to die -- you have to
die -- or you can choose this black door. It is up to you.' The prime
minister asked,'What is behind that black door?' The king said,'That is
not allowed. Nobody knows, because nobody has chosen it before. In the
times of my father, in the times of my grandfather, many times the
opportunity had been given, but nobody has chosen and nobody knows. And
nobody is allowed; even I don't know. I have the key, but when my father
died he said to me,'I will open the door and you can go in and I will
close it. Don't look into it.' But you can see because</p><p>-- you can choose. You can discover what is there. It is up to
you.'</p><p>The prime minister brooded and brooded, and then he chose the gun. He
said,'Kill me with the gun. I don't want to go behind that black door.'
The prime minister was killed. The queen was very curious. She persuaded
the king somehow to see what was behind it. The king laughed. He said,'I
know -- there is nothing behind it. It's simple freedom; there is not
even a room. This door opens to the wide world. There is nothing, but
nobody has chosen it yet.'</p><p>People even choose death before choosing the unknown. People even
choose to be miserable before choosing the unknown. The unknown seems to
be more dangerous than death itself. And freedom is the door unknown.
Freedom means</p><p>moving into the unknown, not knowing where one is going, not knowing
what is going to happen the next moment. It is a black door. Rarely,
sometimes a Jesus or a Buddha choose the door; all else choose the
gun.</p><p>You are dying every day, but you still cling to this life which gives
you nothing except death. You choose death, you don't choose real life.
Real life is hazardous, insecure. You talk about wild seas, you talk
about infinite spaces: look into me, and you will get scared. Look
deeply into me, and you will become afraid. There is only one way to
come near me, and that is to love. To love me is to die to the past. To
love means to trust, to surrender. And there is no problem. If you
really love open spaces and the wild sea, I invite you.</p><p>The fifth question:</p><p>Question 5</p><p>IT IS FROM A NEW SEEKER, GREG EWART.</p><p>OSHO, I WANT TO BECOME A SANNYASIN; BUT SURRENDER MEANS LOVE, AND I
HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED LOVE, NOR HAVE I EVER</p><p>ESTABLISHED A MEANINGFUL RELATIONSHIP WITH ANYONE ELSE. IF I TAKE
SANNYAS NOW, MY DECISION TO DO SO WOULD BE AN</p><p>INTELLECTUAL, MAYBE A HYPOCRITICAL ONE. I WOULD FEEL AS</p><p>THOUGH I WERE USING YOU. HOW CAN I BECOME A SIMPLE, SINCERE</p><p>SANNYASIN?</p><p>I am the black door -- and there is no other way to know me except by
entering me. You say you have never loved. Unless you love, how will you
know? You say you have never been in any deep, intimate relationship.
Unless you are, how you are going to know it?</p><p>Love, surrender, trust, are like swimming. You have to go to the
river. You cannot make it a condition that you will not get into the
river unless you know swimming. If you make that condition you will
never learn, because there is no</p><p>other way to learn it. You have to go, cautiously of course, slowly
of course; there is no need to go to the deepest part. But enter -- find
a spot where you can learn swimming and where you are not afraid to
die.</p><p>Don't enter into me, just give your hand to me. That's what sannyas
is. It is just a beginning, the beginning of the beginning. It is just a
gesture on your part that you are ready to come with me. When you go
swimming, you have to trust the Master who teaches you. It is dangerous,
because who knows? But if you trust, by and by, you become capable,
capable of going to the deeper parts of the river.</p><p>Once you know swimming, then there iB no fear. Whether it is Six feet
deep, or six thousand feet deep makes no difference once you know
swimming.</p><p>I don't say take the jump. I simply say, slowly enter the river.
Remain near the bank where you can feel that any time, if there is
danger, you can get back to the bank. Just give your hand to me, just
trust. And there is no other way.</p><p>To know what trust is, one haB to trust. To know what love is, one
has to love.</p><p>You have been missing your whole life because you have never allowed
the unknown to enter into your life. You wanted first to make it
known.</p><p>Again you are doing the same. You want to become a sannyasin: it is
natural that in the beginning it is going to be a decision on your
mind's part. Your mind will have to decide. And naturally, it will only
be part of your mind. It cannot be total. By and by, it will become
total. Sometimes it may not even be the major part, it may be the minor
part. Ten percent -- of you would like to become a sannyasin, and ninety
percent of you is afraid, but the ninety percent that is afraid is
already dead. You have lived that ninety percent, and you have found
nothing.</p><p>This is the quality of courage: to be always ready to search the
unknown, the yet undiscovered. Because that which you have discovered
has been found futile.</p><p>Move, be courageous. There are treasures to be discovered; you are
carrying them. I am not going to give you anything that you do not
already have. You have it. You have the treasure, you have the key. At
the most, I can show you how to unlock, how to use the key. At the most,
I can show you where the Lock iB and where the key is within you. I can
bring together the key part and the lock part? that's all. The treasure
is yours, it is already there. But you will have to do</p><p>something.</p><p>In the beginning, you will do it hesitantly. In the beginning you may
even feel that it is hypocritical, because you are not total. Good --
this is a good indication, that you are afraid of being hypocritical. It
is a good indication that you would like to take sannyas, and yet you
know that only part of you does, and that too you are not certain about
whether it is real, imaginary, illusory, or deceptive.</p><p>One has to move in spite of all the doubts: that's what courage is.
To be a courageous man does not mean that you have no fears. A man who
has courage, and a cowards are not different basically. The coward has
idea to move into the dark, into the unknown, and the brave man also has
the fear. But the brave man is one who listens to the call of the
unknown in spite of the barriers of the known, and the coward is one who
listens to the known in spite of the call of the unknown. He listens to
the known, and the courageous man listens to the unknown; that is the
only dirference.</p><p>Both parts exist in every person. Every brave man has his coward
behind him, but he does not listen to it. And every coward has his brave
qualities hidden within him, but he has not listened to them. And to
whatsoever part you listen, you become that.</p><p>So take courage. Always take the invitation of the. unknown and your
life will become an adventure.</p><p>A sannyasin is one who has accepted life as an adventure, as a
pilgrimage, as a river flowing to the ocean.</p><p>The sixth question:</p><p>Question 6</p><p>I SOMETIMES FEEL SUCH A FEAR OF MISSING, AS IF I WERE IN A SCHOOL,
AND IF I DIDN'T DO THE RIGHT THING I WOULD FLUNK OUT.</p><p>Yes, you ARE in a school. This is a school. We are learning to be
ourselves here; we are trying the greatest adventure there is -- of
discovering oneself, of reaching to one's own innermost core. It is a
learning place, it is a school. But the whole point is, the whole
teaching of THIS school is not to be worried about</p><p>right and wrong, not to be worried about good and bad, not to be
worried about morality and difference, not to be worried about lower and
higher.</p><p>The whole point of this school is to become choiceless.</p><p>Now I will read the question again:'I sometimes feel such a fear of
missing, as if I were in a school, and if I didn't do the right thing I
would flunk out.'</p><p>This is the right thing here: not to be worried about right and
wrong. To accept oneself is the right thing here, to accept yourself,
whatsoever you are, howsoever you are; to accept in totality and in deep
humbleness that this is the way you are, that this is the way God
intended you to be.</p><p>We are not trying to change you, we are not trying to improve you, we
are not trying any ego-trip. We are simply trying to help you discover
who you are. So the right thing here is not to be worried about right
and wrong, not to be worried about this and that. We are not going to
choose a character, a morality, a code of conduct. No, we are trying to
find out who we are. Once you know who you are, no code of conduct is
needed, no conceptions of right and wrong are needed.</p><p>Once you know who you are, all that you do is right. And, if you
don't know who you are, all that you do is wrong.</p><p>So, we are not worried about right and wrong. The seventh
question:</p><p>Question 7</p><p>OSHO, PLEASE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO ME?</p><p>This is from Madhuri.</p><p>I am killing you Madhuri. I am a murderer, and you are trapped. You
cannot escape me now because once you have tasted a little death, you
cannot escape.</p><p>Because now you know much more is going to come. Once you have tasted
a little death of the ego, you know, you can imagine now, you can dream
of what a beautiful space is going to be there when the whole ego
disappears: when you look within yourself and you don't find anybody
there, just emptiness, vast</p><p>emptiness. If you have found a little empty corner in your being,
then you cannot move away now. You have tasted.</p><p>Now, you cannot go back to the ordinary world. Unless you die, there
is no going back. Once you die, I will send you back to the ordinary
world, because then nothing can corrupt you. Who can corrupt an
emptiness? How can an emptiness be corrupted? It is open, absolutely
vulnerable, and yet invulnerable, because nobody can corrupt it. It is
incorruptible, it is virgin.</p><p>The eighth question:</p><p>Question 8</p><p>WHAT DID JESUS MEAN WHEN HE SAID IN HIS SERMON ON THE MOUNT,'BLESSED
ARE THE POOR IN SPIRIT'?</p><p>That's what I am calling emptiness, SHUNYA, poor in spirit: those who
are nobodies, who cannot claim anything, who have no claims to make --
who are just nobodies.</p><p>Let me tell you one anecdote: A Sufi sage once asked his disciples to
tell him what their vanities had been before they began to study with
him. The first said,'I imagined that I was the most handsome man in the
world.' The second said,'I believed that, since I was religious, I was
one of the elect, the chosen few.' The third said,'I believed I knew,
and I also believed that I could teach.' And the fourth said,'My vanity
was greater than all these, for I believed that I could learn.'</p><p>The sage remarked,'And the fourth disciple's vanity still remains the
greatest, for his vanity is to show that he once had the greatest
vanity. It still remains the greatest.'</p><p>You can become egoistic about your humbleness also. To be poor in
spirit means simply to be nobody, not even humble. A humble man is not
poor in spirit, a humble man is ego, upside-down, ego in a see saw, a
head stand. A humble man is not REALLY humble. A humble man is not
humble at all, because humility is also a function of the ego. When the
ego disappears, humbleness also disappears.</p><p>When you are gone, where can the shadow fall? When you are gone,
there is not</p><p>even shadow. When the ego is gone, humbleness also disappears; it is
a shadow of the same disease.</p><p>The poor in spirit is one who has come to understand that he is not.
To know that one is not is to know that one is part of the whole:'The
whole is, I am not.' The ocean is, the drop is not. And the poor in
spirit is the richest man there is, the richest that is possible. The
poor in spirit is the richest, because the emptiest is the fullest.
Here, death means life.</p><p>And when I say I am a murderer, I simply mean that I am a midwife.
Here, destroying you means giving you rebirth -- a new being, a being
without any ego.</p><p>The ninth question:</p><p>Question 9</p><p>WITHOUT ANY REASON I DO SOME JOBS IN A HURRY; ESPECIALLY EATING.</p><p>This is from Vishnu Chaitanya.</p><p>Vishnu Chaitanya, something is eating you: some deep worry is inside
that creates hurry; some deep tension which does not allow you to
relax.</p><p>So, the next time you are eating something, watch what is eating you.
When you are hurrying, just watch. Are you escaping from somewhere? Are
you trying to avoid some situation? Are you trying not to see something
which is there inside you? Are you trying to suppress something? Is
there some worry and you don't even want to accept that it is there? Is
there some wound which you are hiding in flowers? Watch deep down. All
people who are in a hurry simply show that they are carrying some deep
worry, and they are not even courageous enough to face it. Bring it up,
let it surface. Encounter it, and you will be simply surprised. If you
can encounter any problem face to face, directly, it disappears. In the
inner world, to know that a problem is, to know exactly what it is, to
diagnose, is to treat. There is no other medicine in the inner world. A
problem only exists if you go on suppressing it. If you don't allow it
to be confronted, it exists. And people go on piling many problems, and
then they are always in a hurry. In their hurry they are trying to
evade; because if they rest, silently sit, they Will have to face.</p><p>So they are CONSTANTLY in a hurry, running, doing this and that. Only
when they fall asleep, then apparently are they at rest; but deep down
not even then.</p><p>Then, in their dreams and in their nightmares, they are travelling,
and hurrying, and running.</p><p>Many people come to me and they say that a certain dream occurs
continuously.</p><p>And this is one of the most common dreams: that one is hurrying in
the dream towards the station, and by the time one reaches the platform,
the train leaves.</p><p>This is a very common dream. What does it mean? It means that you are
always and always missing the point, missing the target. And the whole
point of worry is that it needs to be recognized, it needs to be paid
attention to, it needs to be brought into the consciousness.</p><p>All the group therapies that we are doing here are nothing but to
bring out all that is repressed, to help it to surface so that it comes
into the consciousness.</p><p>Once any problem comes into the consciousness, it disappears. It is
just as if you watch, sit near a river and watch. If the water is clean
you can see bubbles coming up. A few bubbles, just on the bottom, go on
clinging; they will remain. If any bubble comes up, the closer it comes
to the surface the bigger it becomes; because with less pressure of the
water, it becomes bigger. When it comes to the surface, it is the
biggest. It may have been just a small bubble at the bottom, but on the
surface it is a big bubble. But then within seconds it erupts, it is
gone.</p><p>The same, exactly the same happens whenever you are suppressing
something. It may be a very small thing, and you are afraid to bring it
to consciousness because when it comes towards the conscious it starts
becoming bigger and bigger; the repression is less and less, and the
pressure is less. It becomes bigger, you become afraid. You force it
back again. Many people who start meditating here come to me and they
say,'We were never so worried as we are now.' Or they say?'We were never
so sad,' or,'We were never so miserable,' or,'We were never so much in
anguish and anxiety.' Their bubbles are becoming bigger because they are
coming nearer to the surface. This is a good sign, a healthy sign that
something is happening I tell them: Be happy, feel grateful that
something is happening. The bubbles are leaving the bottom of your being
and coming to the surface. Once they come to the surface, they explode,
because then there is no pressure on them and they cannot exist.</p><p>A problem can exist only through pressure. No problem can exist
without pressure; it disappears. The whole point of all the therapies
here is to bring all your problems to the surface. Know, watch, become
aware, and the problem disappears. Knowledge -- rather, knowing -- is
transformation. Don't ask,'Once we know the problem is there, what has
to be done?' If you really know it, it is no more there.</p><p>This is the beauty of the inner world: once you know a thing, it is
no longer there.</p><p>It remains only if you go on forcing it, repressing it, avoiding
knowledge, avoiding recognition.</p><p>Problems exist through your ignorance, through your
unconsciousness.</p><p>Consciousness is the solution. Remember, I call it the SOLUTION. It
has nothing to do with any particular problem. Every and all problems
disappear through it -</p><p>- it is THE SOLUTION.</p><p>The tenth question:</p><p>Question 10</p><p>SO MANY QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN ASKED OF YOU. IS THERE A LIMIT AFTER
WHICH NO MORE NEW QUESTIONS CAN BE FOUND?</p><p>If your question is authentic, then there is a limit. But if your
questions are borrowed, borrowed from the books, borrowed from others,
borrowed from knowledge and information, then there is no limit. If your
question is true, relevant to your being, then there is a limit. Sooner
or later you will come to it; they are finished. But if they are
scholarly, then there is no limit to it.</p><p>Let me tell you one anecdote.</p><p>It happened: The lady of the house was out when her new maid called
at her home and rang the bell. The pet parrot answered by calling,'Who
is that?'</p><p>'It is the new maid,' was the reply. There was a pause. Then the girl
rang the bell again, and the parrot answered,'Who is that?'</p><p>'It is the new maid,' came the reply once more. She was a little
annoyed. This went on until the exasperated girl fell on the ground and
fainted, because she would say,'It is the new maid,' and the parrot
would ask again,'Who is that?'</p><p>because that was the only question he could ask. That was a borrowed
question; it was not his question. He didn't even know what it
meant.</p><p>Returning home, the householder stumbled across the body, and
exclaimed,'Who is that!'</p><p>'It is the new maid,' answered the parrot, because by now he had
learned it. The eleventh question:</p><p>Question 11</p><p>YOU SEEM TO ADVOCATE COMMITMENT AND NON-ATTACHMENT IN</p><p>LOVE, WHETHER WITH MASTER OR LOVER. I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW</p><p>ONE CAN BE COMMITTED AND UNATTACHED AT THE SAME TIME.</p><p>In fact, they always happen together, they cannot happen separately.
It is impossible to separate them, because they are two aspects of the
same coin: commitment and unattachment. If you are attached, then it is
not a commitment.</p><p>Then you are using the other for yourself because it is an
attachment.</p><p>You love a person and you say,'I am committed and attached.' What
does attachment mean? It means that you are using the other person for
yourself, you are using the other person as a means. How can one be
committed to a means?</p><p>Commitment is possible only towards an end, not towards a means. You
cannot be committed to a car, you cannot be committed to a house. They
are means; they have to be used. You can only Be committed to an alive
person, because</p><p>each person is the goal.</p><p>Love is not using the person for your own pleasure. Much pleasure
comes through it, but that is a by-product. You love the person as an
end; you are committed. You can give your very life to the person, but
there is no attachment, because attachment means that you are using the
person for yourself.</p><p>Commitment with nonattachment means that now the other has become the
goal, the end, the very end. They always happen together, and if they
cannot happen together then you are missing something. If commitment is
with attachment, then you are just deceiving yourself that it is a
commitment. Sooner or later, if the person dies, you will find another
person -- because you were using the person. Now that he is not
available, you will find another person.</p><p>A commitment is eternal. Your wife dies: on that day, all women
disappear from the world for you. You loved her as a goal. Now it is
even impossible to conceive that you can love another. It was so total
that nothing is left behind. And it was so total that only the body can
die, not the soul of that being. Death cannot part two lovers. If they
really loved, they had conquered death already. Love is immortal. But if
there was only an attachment, then after a few weeks or a few days the
wound is healed. You loved the person because of you, for your own
pleasure. Now you will find another person. In fact, you love your
husband, you say that you love, and he's dying -- or your wife -- and
when the wife is dying, on the deathbed, if somebody could open a window
in your head and look, you are already planning and trying to find a new
woman.</p><p>The mind, at the most, exploits. It can never become a deep
commitment. Deep commitment is of being. It knows no time, it knows no
death. I am not saying that it is permanent, because permanence is part
of time. It is eternal. It has the fragrance of divineness.</p><p>Let me tell you one anecdote: A politician named Strange lay dying. A
friend asked him what he would like inscribed on his tombstone,'Just
put,' said the politician: Here lies an honest politician.</p><p>'But,' said the friend,'that doesn't tell who it is.'</p><p>'Oh yes, replied the politician,'the passer-by will say,'That is
strange -- a politician, and honest?' -- no need to say the name.
Passers-by will by themselves say,'That is strange.'</p><p>Attachment and love never go together; commitment and attachment
never go together. Love goes with unattachment. Then love has a purity
of the other world. Then love is absolute essence, absolute pureness,
innocence. And then there is a commitment. That commitment is
eternal.</p><p>The twelfth question:</p><p>Question 12</p><p>YOU SEEM TO EMPHASIZE DIFFERENT POINTS EVERY DAY: BEING</p><p>ORDINARY, BEING AWARE, BEING MEDITATIVE, AND SO ON. IF I TRY TO</p><p>PRACTICE THEM ALL I GET CONFUSED TRYING TO REACH A HARMONY</p><p>OF ALL. SHOULD I JUST FORGET, AND BE SPONTANEOUS?</p><p>You have got the point exactly, precisely. That is the whole point:
be spontaneous.</p><p>And whatsoever I am saying is not contradictory. You can get confused
because you are already confused. And in your confusion, when my words
enter they create even more confusion -- because a confused mind can
only create more confusion, nothing else.</p><p>What I am saying is not contradictory at all. It may appear so
sometimes, but it is not.</p><p>Let me tell you a Sufi story.</p><p>An interchange between a Sufi and an enquirer:'Which statement should
one choose if two Sufi sayings contradict each other?'</p><p>'They only contradict one another if viewed separately. If you clap
your hands and observe only the movement of the hands, they appear to
oppose one another. You have not seen what is happening. The purpose of
the opposition of the palms was, of course, to produce the hand clap. If
I clap my hands they are opposing each other, but there is a synthesis
in the sound; the opposition is</p><p>creating a synthesis.'</p><p>I go on talking of so many different things to create a certain sound
in you. That sound is spontaneity. If you have understood that, you have
understood rightly.</p><p>The last question:</p><p>Question 13</p><p>DEAR OSHO, HELLO.</p><p>I will tell you an anecdote.</p><p>A persistent man said that he would teach a parrot to say 'hello' in
an hour. He went close to the parrot's cage, and started saying,'Hello,
hello.' This went on for a full thirty minutes without the parrot giving
the slightest attention. At last the bird turned his head slowly,
blinked at the man, and said,'Number engaged.'</p><p>I will not say anything else about it.</p><p>You say 'hello'? You don't know; it can be said to me only through
your being.</p><p>Otherwise, the number is engaged. Words won't reach me. You will have
to say them through your total being; otherwise, the number is
engaged.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;line-height:192%;text-align:left id=come-follow-to-you-vol-4-chapter-11>Come Follow To You, Vol 4

HIS NAME AMONG ALL NATIONS, BEGINNING AT JERUSALEM.</p><p>48 AND YE ARE WITNESSES OF THESE THINGS.</p><p>THE greatest problem that a man like Jesus faces is that whatsoever
he is going to say will appear untrue to people -- because truth cannot
be said; and the moment you say it, it is falsified. Truth cannot be
uttered. The language in which you utter it is not big enough. It kills
the truth, it can only express the untrue.</p><p>But, out of compassion, a Jesus, a Buddha, will try to say that which
cannot be said. But then they will be misunderstood. They bring news of
the beyond. You have not even dreamed about it; how can you understand?
You have no conception of it; how can you understand? Misunderstanding
is natural. Nobody is actually at fault. Jesus brings something from the
beyond. You have never been there -- something of the other world. You
listen:'This man appears authentic.</p><p>His very being gives some authority to whatsoever he is saying.' But
that is a feeling -- you cannot understand what he is saying. At the
most you can trust, which is very difficult, almost impossible.</p><p>How to trust? How to trust somebody else about things which you know
nothing about? Not only that, but how to trust about things which go
diametrically opposite to your experience?</p><p>I was reading a small story the other night.</p><p>A man was walking along, and he saw a snail lodged in a crevice in a
wall, and for no particular reason he said,'Hello snail.'</p><p>And oddly enough the snail could speak, and the snail could hear, and
it said,'Hello.' And it moved its eyes around as best it could on their
stalks to try to see what it was that was confronting him.</p><p>So the man said,'Can you hear me?' And the snail said,'Yes, of
course. Who and what are you anyway?'</p><p>The man said,'Well, I am a man.' And the snail said,'Whatever is
that?'</p><p>So the man said,'Well, we are something like you. For instance, you
have got eyes on stalks and we have got stalks on the other end.'</p><p>The snail said,'The other end?'</p><p>And the man said,'Yes -- just a minute -- it is for putting our feet
on, you see, these feet.'</p><p>The snail said,'Whatever are these feet for?'</p><p>And the man said,'The feet are for moving along very rapidly on.'</p><p>The snail said,'Really? You amaze me. Is there anything, else about
you that is peculiar?'</p><p>And the man said,'Well, you know how you have got your house on your
back?' The snail said,'Yes, yes.'</p><p>And the man said,'Well, we don't know. You see, we have lots and lots
of houses, and we go in and out of them almost at will.'</p><p>The snail said,'You really are a most astonishing creature. Is there
anything else that's strange about you?'</p><p>And the man said,'Well now, we are men, and a man can take a thing
like a leaf; you know, a leaf?'</p><p>And the snail said,'Yes. Yes, I know a leaf.'</p><p>The man said,'Well, he can make marks on this leaf, and even hand the
leaf to another man, who can give the leaf to a third man, who can tell
from the marks on the leaf what the first man was thinking about.'</p><p>'Ah,' said the snail,'I see, you are one of them. Hm '</p><p>The man said,'What do you mean?'</p><p>'You are a liar,' said the snail.'The trouble with you liars is that
you tell one lie, and then you tell a bigger one, and then finally you
over-reach yourselves.'</p><p>That's the feeling with a man like Jesus. Ordinary humanity feels
that way: that Jesus is over-reaching himself. Maybe he has a magnetic
personality, a charisma around him. Maybe he is a powerful man, a
beautiful person. Maybe he has a certain convincing force in him. He is
a man worth loving, but he is over- reaching himself. Whatever he is
saying is beyond the ordinary human mind. In fact, it is beyond the
human mind. He is bringing something into the world of the mind from the
world of no-mind. This is an almost unbridgeable gap. He is bound to be
misunderstood.</p><p>In misunderstanding he was crucified. And when on the cross he
said,'Father, forgive these people, because they know not what they are
doing,' it was not just compassion, it was not just love. It was
compassion, it was love; it was also fact.</p><p>Those people who were crucifying him, in fact, were fast asleep,
unconscious.</p><p>Whatsoever they were doing, they were not aware of it. They had never
thought about the implications of it. They were not crucifying Jesus,
they were simply crucifying a liar, they were simply crucifying someone
who had been disturbing their silent, peaceful lives, who had been
forcing them against their wills on an adventure which seemed dangerous,
who had been talking about God, which everybody knows does not exist,
and yet everybody believes in as a social formality.</p><p>Jesus was trying to prove that God exists, not as a social formality,
not as a prop for morality, not as a hypothesis to explain the
unexplainable. God exists. In fact, ONLY God exists: He is the ultimate
fact. Whenever people like Jesus start talking about the ultimate fact,
a suspicion arises in the ordinary mind:'They are over-reaching
themselves. It's okay to believe in God, and to believe in the church
and in the temple. It is good to pretend to be religious. It helps -- it
is a social lubricant. It gives life a certain smoothness; it gives you
a certain respectability. But one should not take these things too
seriously. This man Jesus seems to be too serious about it, as if it is
a life-and-death problem.'</p><p>To him, it is the only problem worth encountering, and the only
adventure worth going on, the only research. But to the people he was
talking to, it looked like nonsense. They may not have said so; they may
not have said so out of propriety.</p><p>They may not have said that they didn't believe, because they would
not like to have been known by others as unbelievers. But deep down, it
didn't seem probable that God exists; it was the most improbable thing,
that God exists. Jesus looks untrue, a Buddha looks untrue. Out of their
sheer magnetism people are fascinated. But even those who are fascinated
are not totally with them. Their deepest core goes on denying and
saying,'You are hypnotized. This man has done something to you, like
magic. He has trapped you, you have become a prisoner.' When the people
start feeling like this, they take revenge. This revenge happens almost
automatically.</p><p>The people who killed Jesus killed in their sleep, as if it was just
a dream.</p><p>There is a Sufi anecdote: A group of merchants asked a certain
disciple,'How can this Sufi nonsense mean anything to you?'</p><p>To the ordinary mind, to the logical, to the rational part of you,
anything that is not comprehensible is nonsense. In fact, it is, because
it is beyond sense. If you love it, you may call it super-sense. If you
don't love it, you may call it nonsense.</p><p>But one thing is certain: that it is something beyond the scope of
the senses.</p><p>A group of merchants asked a certain disciple,'How can this Sufi
nonsense mean anything to you?' He said,'Because it means everything to
those whom I respect.'</p><p>Because it means everything to those whom I respect... this is what
trust is.</p><p>Jesus creates a respect about his being. Because of that respect, you
believe whatsoever he says. Because of that respect, a certain trust is
created, but your rational mind goes on hammering within you and
saying,'This is all nonsense.</p><p>What are you doing?' And when I say this to you, you can understand,
because this is happening to you every day also: whatsoever I am saying
to you is nonsense. There is no need for anybody else to prove that it
is nonsense; it is nonsense. But if you respect me and love me, that
nonsense will start appearing as super-sense, as transcendental to mind,
reason, logic -- not below, but above.</p><p>If you respect me and love me, you may allow me to take you over to
another world in which you cannot believe right now.</p><p>Almost every day people come to me and they say,'How can we believe?'
I</p><p>understand their problem, their anguish: they would like to believe.
It is not that they want not to believe, because belief gives such
serenity, belief gives such tranquility, belief gives such a
centeredness and rootedness, that who would not like to believe? Even an
atheist is in search of belief. Maybe he is very desperate; maybe his
saying that there is no God is nothing but an effort to avoid that great
call that is constantly heard in his being -- 'Go on the adventure. Seek
and find.'</p><p>He does not want to hear that call. He says that there is no God.</p><p>I have never come across an atheist who is really an atheist. All
atheists are in search, all atheists are in deep search for a faith and
trust. But they are afraid. The adventure seems to be so dangerous and
risky. They start believing in no- God, but that no-God is also a
belief. It is negative: it cannot be nourishing, it cannot give you
life, energy; it cannot enhance your being, it cannot help you to become
centered. It cannot help you to see the true and the real because it is
a false belief, a negative belief. But, I say, it is still a belief.</p><p>There are only believers and believers, because nobody can live in
non-belief, in no-belief, in no-faith, in no-trust. To live without
believing is absolutely impossible. But the first dawn of truth always
happens with what this Sufi disciple is saying:'Because it means
everything to those whom I respect.' If you respect, you are open to
receive.</p><p>The Judaic word 'kabala' originally means: capacity to receive. It is
a beautiful word. It means: those who are ready to receive; they are
kabalists. Respect creates the capacity to receive, to become pregnant.
Not knowing what is going to happen, but you trust somebody, you respect
somebody.</p><p>People respected Jesus. They started following him, but then deep
down they also always felt that he was over-reaching. He was taking them
so fast and so beyond human comprehension, that by and by they became
frightened and scared of this man. They had to kill him, there was no
other way.</p><p>They must have felt relieved when they killed Jesus. They must have
felt a stillness descending, because this man had been creating a chaos.
This man had been creating such turmoil. He had to create it, because
only out of chaos are stars born, and only out of chaos and pain and
anguish is a new birth possible.</p><p>But he was looking into the future, and they were clinging to the
past, and there</p><p>was no meeting ground. Even today, between Christ and a Christian
there is no meeting ground. The meeting ground is possible only if you
also try to over- reach yourself. Otherwise, the meeting ground is not
possible.</p><p>A friend of mine, an old navy chaplain, tells of a terrible storm a
couple of years ago, a storm so severe that even old seamen were
scared.</p><p>After it was all over, an old salt-crusted sailor said,'Chaplain, I
sure did pray during the blow. I am not a praying man, but I prayed hard
that time.'</p><p>'What did you say in your prayer?' asked the chaplain.</p><p>'Oh,' replied the sailor,'I said: Lord, you know that I have not
asked you for anything for fifty years, and if you get me out of this
storm alive, I promise that I won't bother you again for another fifty
years!'</p><p>Only in pain, in anguish, only in a chaos where everything is
dissolving into nothingness, does one remember God. A Jesus has to
create a chaos, a Jesus has to destroy your notions of security, your
so-called comfortable life, the illusion of it. He has to dis-illusion
you, and that's why he looks like the enemy. The friend looks like the
enemy; the greatest friend looks like the greatest enemy because he has
to disillusion you. He has to bring you out of your illusions and
dreams. He has to create a chaos, because only in that anguish, you may
start praying. Jesus did both. He lived a life of infinite delight; he
lived a life of constant celebration, he was one of the most dancing men
ever on this earth.</p><p>Don't listen to the Christians who say that he never laughed: it is
impossible. If Jesus never laughed, then I would like to say to you that
he never existed. Then the whole story is false. Jesus, and never
laughed? -- then who will be able to laugh? He laughed -- his laughter
may have been very subtle -- you may not have heard it. That much I can
understand. His delight must have been very subtle and profound. You may
not have been able to see it; that I can understand.</p><p>His celebration must have been so deep that you could not go that
deep, and you could not feel it. He lived out of his heart, he lived out
of his depth. You may have missed, because to look into the depth of a
man like Jesus or Buddha is to look into abyss: one gets dizzy, one
becomes frightened, one closes one's eyes.</p><p>It is possible that people didn't become aware of Jesus' celebration,
but he was a man of celebration. He enjoyed the small things of life. He
made everything</p><p>sacred. He was not an escapist, he did not renounce anything. In
fact, whatsoever he touched became sacred, wherever he moved became holy
ground.</p><p>Whatsoever he did, just because he did it, the quality of it was
transformed. He lived a life of celebration on the one hand; on the
other hand, he continuously created chaos around you. He was living at
two ends together: that is his cross.</p><p>That is the meaning of his carrying his cross on his shoulders: he is
living two polarities together. He is a paradox, he creates chaos, and
you can see him dancing amidst the chaos; because these are the two
points to remember God.</p><p>Either you remember Him when you are in deep trouble -- which is the
way of ordinary humanity -- or you remember Him when you are at a peak
of happiness, of bliss -- which is not the way of ordinary humanity.
When you are happy, you forget God; whenever you are unhappy, you
remember.</p><p>Jesus created both possibilities together. He created a
disillusionment for you, so that you were in anguish and you could pray.
Out of your anguish tears can come, and you melt into prayer. You can
again call God 'the Father', the whole.</p><p>And just near your chaos, He is celebrating. If you are capable of
seeing, if you have eyes, then you will become aware that prayer has two
possibilities: one, in unhappiness -- then it is out of helplessness;
the other, in happiness -- then it is out of gratitude.</p><p>Jesus' prayer is different from your prayer: his prayer is of deep
thankfulness, your prayer is of helplessness. But he presented both the
possibilities together.</p><p>One day, a quivering man visited a Sufi Master to plead,'Please help
me find myself.'</p><p>During the discussion a messenger of the troubled man appeared.'I
thought you would like to know,' said the messenger,'that your business
affairs have taken a sudden turn towards prosperity.',</p><p>The visitor exclaimed to the Master,'Oh, I feel better now.
Good-bye.'</p><p>A month later, the still troubled man returned to repeat his
sorrowful request,'Please help me! I cannot bear my agony any
longer.'</p><p>The messenger appeared a second time, saying with a sly grin,'A
beautiful woman awaits you at home.'</p><p>The visitor Leapt up to gasp,'All is well. Good-bye.'</p><p>A friend of the Master asked him,'How often will that quivering man
repeat that pattern of foolish behavior?'</p><p>Sighed the Master,'Until he sees.'</p><p>Jesus created chaos for you, because only in deep discomfort, in deep
disillusionment, in total helplessness, is your prayer possible. And
just by the side there, he was standing, happy, tremendously happy,
prayerful -- a deep gratitude, a sheer delight in being, an ecstasy.
Your prayer is out of agony, his prayer is out of ecstasy. And he was
just standing by the side.</p><p>If you could see, you would take the jump. Your prayer would then no
longer be of helplessness. Your prayer would also become of gratitude,
of tremendous gratefulness. You are not helpless. You are helpless
because you are thinking of yourself as separate from the whole.</p><p>It is your illusion of separateness that creates helplessness.</p><p>The helplessness is just your illusion. Once the illusion drops, you
are the whole.</p><p>Jesus goes on saying,'I, and my Father who is in heaven, are one.'
Then suddenly, you are not helpless. You are at the very center of
existence -- how can you be helpless? You are not separate from the
whole -- how can you be helpless?</p><p>Helplessness is the shadow of the ego. Jesus tries to disillusion you
so that the shadow of ego disappears.</p><p>But rather than moving with him, rather than accepting his invitation
to go and follow him, people killed him. He was too much of a
troublemaker; he was too much to be tolerated.</p><p>Sigmund Freud has written in one of his significant letters to a
friend, 'Man cannot live without illusions.' Take away the illusion of a
man and his whole life becomes meaningless. Everybody has a life-lie
around which he lives. Take</p><p>away the life-lie and the whole meaning disappears, the whole life
collapses. Just watch inside yourself: you must have a life-lie, a dream
which is not true; and you know it, because you have created it. But you
don't want to know that. You go on avoiding the fact, that this is
untrue; you go on believing that this is true.</p><p>Freud's insight was right. He should know, because for fifty years
continuously he was dealing with people's lives, their innermost minds.
He must have come across it again and again.</p><p>The same is my observation: everybody is living for some illusion.
Take the illusion away and the life collapses, and he will become your
enemy. And that is what Jesus was doing, what Buddha was doing. This is
what I am doing here: trying to take away your life-lie. Freud's insight
was half true. It is true: take the life-lie of a man away and his life
collapses; but this is only a half-truth. Help him to see the truth,
then a new life arises. And until that new life arises you are simply
waiting a great opportunity. A life of fantasy is not a life at all.
Everybody has to pass through the cross'The cross' means: the cross of
the life- lie. And everybody has to come to a resurrection. The
resurrection means a life of truth, a life according to the real. The
man, the ordinary man goes on trying to make the reality follow his lie.
The courageous man, the religious man, drops the lie and follows
reality. Don't try to make the truth follow you -- follow truth.</p><p>That is the meaning when Jesus says,'Come, follow me.' He is saying:
drop your life-lies, your illusions about power, prestige, money, greed,
jealousy, ego, and a thousand and one things. Drop those life-lies,
come, follow me. Follow the true, follow the real. Truth liberates. But
in the beginning, it is painful.</p><p>Rather than change themselves, people killed Jesus. Rather than
killing their own egos, they found it easier to kill this man. Nobody is
responsible, in fact. Jesus had to destroy their illusions, and in their
sleep they had to react, so it is natural.</p><p>The sutras.</p><p>Jesus is crucified; the miracle has not happened. The crowd waited
and went away home, frustrated. The disciples waited, hiding themselves
in the crowd, because they were also suspicious, doubtful. They
respected the man, they also had a certain faith in this man, but not
that much. They could follow him when he was succeeding. Now, he was a
failure. And nobody has failed like Jesus,</p><p>because nobody has tried so hard to bring the beyond. Nobody has
tried so hard to bring eternity into the world of time. He tried the
impossible, and he failed.</p><p>His failure is beautiful.</p><p>He failed on the path of truth and it is better to fail on the path
of truth than to succeed on the path of a lie. Failure and success don't
mean anything. The effort, the intention, means everything.</p><p>The disciples were hiding in the crowd. They were not revealing
themselves, who they were, because they were afraid. Their teacher,
their Master, was being hanged. If they revealed themselves, who they
were, they would also be hanged, or killed, or mistreated; or at least
beaten. They were afraid. They were waiting for the miracle:'If the
Master succeeds, if God descends from heaven, or angels descend from
heaven and they save Jesus, and he reveals the glory about which he was
always talking and about which nobody has ever believed totally '
They</p><p>were waiting. If the miracle happened, they would reveal themselves.
Then they would shout,'We are the disciples!' But if he failed, they
would simply disappear into the crowd. The fragile, the weak human
mind.… There is nothing to condemn; one should just feel compassion.</p><p>It is an old story. It happened that in India there existed a great
university, Nalanda was the name of the university. One visitor went to
see the university.</p><p>The vice-chancellor of the university took the visitor. The visitor
must have been a very important personage; he took him around. It is
said that there were almost ten thousand students in the university.
From almost all over the world, seekers would come to the university.
The guest was very impressed.</p><p>He said,'My, just how many students do you have here?' "Well,'
answered the vice-chancellor thoughtfully,'I would say, about one in a
hundred.'</p><p>And if that was the number of students, what to say about disciples?
-- about one in ten thousand. If you see ten thousand disciples, the
possibility is that there may be, or may not even be, one disciple
there. That is the proportion. When students are one in a hundred And a
student has nothing to lose, just to gain.</p><p>A disciple has everything to lose and nothing to gain, or ONLY
NOTHING to gain.</p><p>Jesus had disciples, but they all disappeared. He died alone. In
fact, he lived alone, he walked alone on this earth. The multitude that
followed him, and the disciples who were around him were just so-so.
Lukewarm was their trust. There was no intense passion in it, because
when the Master was being crucified, there was the test. They were
hiding themselves. They must have been greedy people, as all so-called
religious people are.</p><p>Just before Jesus was caught and imprisoned they were discussing
amongst themselves,'In heaven, when Jesus will be sitting by the right
side of God, what will be the position of the disciples, the twelve? Who
will be sitting next to Jesus?' Of course they allowed Jesus to sit next
to God; but who would be sitting next to Jesus? There was great argument
amongst them. They were greedy people. They were just extending their
ordinary minds into their so-called religious heaven. Their heaven was
nothing but an extension of this earth. It was nothing new. Jesus
remained alone, died alone.</p><p>Try to understand this, because just to think that you are following
when there is no danger is not enough. When death comes, when danger
comes, then there will be the test. Then, not even a single disciple
declared to be with him.</p><p>In fact, when Jesus was taken as a prisoner, Peter wanted to follow
him. Jesus told him,'No need to follow me, because you will deny me.'
Peter said,'Never! I will never deny you.' Jesus said,'You will deny me.
Even before the cock crows and the sun has risen, you will have denied
me thrice.' And it happened. All the disciples fled; only Peter
followed. But those people who had made him prisoner became suspicious:
somebody was amongst them who looked a stranger. They asked him,'Who are
you? Are you a disciple of Jesus?' He said,'No, I don't know this man.
Who is he?' And Jesus looked back and said,'The morning has not yet
come.' And it happened a second time; and it happened thrice. Jesus
laughed, and looked back at the crowd and said,'The cock has not crowed
yet.'</p><p>It is so difficult to follow a Master when he is moving into death.
And this the ONLY way to follow a Master, there is no other. Because a
Master has to lead you into death; that is the only way to be reborn.
There is no other. Until you die, you will not be able to be reborn.
Only through death is eternal life attained, only through losing
yourself do you gain.</p><p>Jesus died. No miracle happened. The crowd, feeling frustrated,
disappeared.</p><p>AND AS THEY THUS SPAKE, JESUS HIMSELF STOOD IN THE MIDST OF</p><p>THEM, AND SAITH UNTO THEM. PEACE BE UNTO YOU.</p><p>The disciples gathered and they discussed what to do now. They were
feeling absolutely betrayed, deceived. This man simply proved not a real
son of God. He had promised again and again that he would be
resurrected, that he would come down out of death with a new, eternal
body of light. And he died like an ordinary man; and he died complaining
to God,'My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?' So.God had betrayed
Jesus, Jesus had betrayed his disciples, and they were at a loss as to
what to do now. They must have been a laughing-stock.</p><p>People must have laughed at them:'These were Jesus' disciples --
fools, simpletons! They used to believe that this man would come out of
death, and this man has simply died like an ordinary man.'</p><p>AND AS THEY THUS SPAKE... as the disciples were discussing amongst
themselves, JESUS HIMSELF STOOD IN THE MIDST OF THEM, AND SAITH</p><p>UNTO THEM: PEACE BE UNTO YOU.</p><p>They were very troubled, in deep turmoil; their whole lives were
lost. They had followed this man, and this man had simply died. Now what
to do, where to go?</p><p>Where to hide oneself; how to accept the failure? They were very
troubled. They must have been so troubled that Jesus was standing
amongst them and they could not see him.</p><p>In fact, you can only see that which you are expecting to see. They
were not expecting. In fact, they were thinking,'We knew that this was
going to happen; this man has died and there has been no miracle.' The
miracle had happened, but to see the miracle, to be able to see it, you
need a different quality of being. The miracle was not a part of
ordinary reality, it is a separate reality. The miracle had happened:
Jesus was standing amongst them, and they could not see. It was as if
they were almost blind.</p><p>We are -- almost blind, almost drunk. We only see that which we want
to see, we only see that which we are expecting to see.</p><p>Have you watched that your gestalt of vision continually changes? If
you are hungry you see different things. You go to the marketplace and
you are hungry; you see the restaurants, the hotels, the displayed
foods, the fruits. You see things through your hunger. If you are not
hungry and you go to the same marketplace, you don't see the
restaurants, you don't see the food, the food stalls, the fruit sellers.
You simply bypass them. They don't become part of your attention. If you
are sexually starved, you go on looking at women or men. If you are not
sexually starved, it simply does not matter who is who. Whether somebody
who is approaching you is a man or a woman does not matter if you are
not sexually starved. Whatsoever you see, it is not only the object that
you see; your subjectivity gets involved in it.</p><p>Jesus was standing amongst them and he said to them,'Peace be unto
you.' Why?</p><p>He said,'Just become peaceful, be silent. I am here. About whom are
you talking?</p><p>Peace be unto you.'</p><p>BUT THEY WERE TERRIFIED. When they heard, when they became aware of
this man suddenly standing amongst them, THEY WERE TERRIFIED AND</p><p>AFRIGHTED, AND SUPPOSED THAT THEY HAD SEEN A SPIRIT, a ghost.</p><p>For this miracle they had been waiting. But just to wait is not
enough; one has to be ready for it.</p><p>It happened once: An old man used to come to me. He said one night --
it must have been near about eleven o'clock and he was departing -- he
said,'I would take sannyas, I would surrender myself to you totally if
you could do one miracle.' I said,'What is the miracle?' He said,'If you
can come tonight in my dream, tomorrow morning I am going to take
sannyas.' I said,'Okay, but don't get frightened. Don't be afraid, don't
get scared.' He said,'I am not scared'; but the way he said it, I felt
that he was very scared. Then he went up to the gate, and he came back,
and he said?'It is too dark, and the road is very quiet, and my house is
far away, five, six miles, and in this cold night I don't want to go. I
would like to stay here.' I said,'What is the matter? Are you afraid to
go back home? Don't be afraid. At the most, if the miracle happens, I
will come in your dream.' But he said,'Now, I must confess. I am afraid'
-- even in a dream!</p><p>What is the fear? -- because, if this is possible, a separate
reality, a different reality opens its door to you. You have to face the
unknown. He had asked for it, but he was afraid. He said,'No need to
come. I will come and take sannyas.'</p><p>If I can enter in your dream, you will be scared. A dream is a very
private thing: nobody can enter into anybody's dream. Ordinarily that is
not possible. Even two lovers cannot enter into each other's dream.
Dreaming is a totally private thing and if somebody can enter into your
dream, suddenly your privacy is violated.</p><p>One becomes afraid. If somebody can enter into your dream, then
somebody can watch your thoughts, and somebody can watch your feelings,
and somebody can see your within... and the fear. Just think about it.
If somebody could look into you and see your thoughts and your feelings,
you would be scared to death.</p><p>Because everybody is carrying so many ugly things, and nobody can see
that things are okay.</p><p>'If you could see into each other,' psychologists say,'if people
could see into each other, love would become impossible.' Friendship
would never be possible; there would only be enemies in the world. Just
think what you have been thinking about your lover: just a little anger,
and you would like to kill him. If people could watch each other's
minds, you would be completely violated; there would be fear. The man
was afraid.</p><p>These people were asking for the miracles to happen. It had happened,
but they were not ready. Because, to see a miracle one needs the vision
to see it, one needs a totally different gestalt. The miracle is
happening every moment -- the whole existence is miraculous and every
moment of life is a miracle. You cannot find greater miracles than are
already happening all around you. But you cannot know, you cannot see,
you are not ready. You go on living in your drab and dull mind, almost
asleep.</p><p>I have heard: A welfare worker once said to a confirmed drunkard,'The
last time we met I was very happy, because you were sober. Today I am
unhappy to see you drunk again.''Well,' said the drunkard,'it is my turn
to be happy today, sir.'</p><p>Your happiness consists only of your unconsciousness. Whenever you
are conscious, you become unhappy. And unless you can be consciously
happy, your happiness is not worth the bother. I work on so many people:
the moment they start becoming conscious they become unhappy. They come
to me and they</p><p>say,'What are you doing? We had come here to become more happy, and
the more we become conscious, the more unhappy we feel.' Because the
happiness that consisted of their unconsciousness is disappearing, and
that was all the happiness they knew. They have not known any happiness
which is conscious.</p><p>They become unhappy, disillusioned.</p><p>If they escape, they miss the opportunity. If they persist, first the
happiness of unconsciousness will disappear, and there will be a time,
an interval of much agony, much chaos, much anarchy. They will lose all
their identity. They will not be able to know who they are, because all
that they knew about themselves belonged to their unconsciousness. They
will be completely lost, almost mad.</p><p>But, if they persist, soon a new sort of happiness, a new sort of
blissfulness which has nothing to do with illusions and unconsciousness
arises. If you cannot be happy consciously, your happiness is not
worthwhile; -it is useless. People go on living in their sleep --
sometimes their eyes are closed, sometimes their eyes are open, but the
sleep continues. It is rarely broken!</p><p>Those disciples were standing talking about Jesus, and Jesus was
there. They could not see. It seems impossible. No, it is not
impossible; it is just natural to human unconsciousness.</p><p>One day it happened: Mulla Nasrudin came to see me.'Why have you
wrapped a thread around your finger?' I asked the Mulla.</p><p>He said,'My wife wrapped it to remind me that I should not forget to
post a letter for her.'</p><p>'Have you posted the letter?' I asked.</p><p>'No,' said the Mulla,'she forgot to give it to me.'</p><p>This is how we go on living: without any selfremembering, without any
awareness, without any consciousness.</p><p>Jesus said,'Peace be unto you'...</p><p>BUT THEY WERE TERRIFIED AND AFRIGHTED, AND SUPPOSED THAT</p><p>THEY HAD SEEN A SPIRIT.</p><p>AND HE SAID UNTO THEM: WHY ARE YE TROUBLED? AND WHY DO THOUGHTS ARISE
IN YOUR HEARTS?</p><p>'Can't you see me? Why are these thoughts arising in your minds and
in your hearts? Can't you see me? Can't you recognize me? I lived for
years with you, and you lived for years with me. Don't you know my
face?'</p><p>AND HE SAID UNTO THEM: WHY ARE YE TROUBLED? AND WHY DO THOUGHTS ARISE
IN YOUR HEARTS?</p><p>BEHOLD MY HANDS AND MY FEET, THAT IT IS I MYSELF.</p><p>HANDLE ME AND SEE, FOR THE SPIRIT HATH NOT FLESH AND BONES, AS YE SEE
ME HAVE.</p><p>Pitiable humanity... even Jesus has to bring proofs that he is. And
the proofs that you ask are proofs of matter, of materiality. A Jesus,
even a Jesus has to show you:'Behold my hands and my feet.' You cannot
see, you cannot face the reality, the infinite reality that is
confronting you. Hands and feet you can believe in; matter is needed.
The immaterial becomes non-existential.'Handle me and see, for a spirit
hath not flesh and bones as ye see me have.'</p><p>How far we have fallen into unconsciousness! How far we have become
insensitive! We can only feel the most gross, we cannot feel the
subtle.</p><p>And when he had thus spoken, he showed them his hand and his
feet.…</p><p>Pitiable humanity, that a Jesus has to give you evidence for his
existence, and the evidence has to be material. He showed his hands and
his feet.</p><p>AND WHILE THEY YET BELIEVED NOT... because they were so
frightened:'Who knows? That ghost may be playing tricks? Who knows? How
can a dead man come back?' Jesus was crucified, they had seen him
die:'How could he come? It is impossible. It is some trick, some ghost
playing a game.'</p><p>AND WHILE THEY YET BELIEVED NOT FOR JOY, AND WONDERED,</p><p>HE SAID UNTO THEM: HAVE YE HERE ANY MEAT?</p><p>These are very symbolic words. Now he is coming to the grossest,
because you cannot see the subtle. Even a Jesus has to descend to your
plane; only then can you see him. You cannot see his peak, you can see
only his feet, and even those are difficult to believe.</p><p>HAVE YE HERE ANY MEAT?</p><p>AND THEY GAVE HIM A PIECE OF A BROILED FISH, AND OF AN
HONEYCOMBE.</p><p>AND HE TOOK IT, AND DID EAT BEFORE THEM -- because a spirit cannot
eat. Food is needed for the body. A Spirit has no body; food is
irrelevant. And he ate meat, the grossest food. This is just
symbolic.</p><p>Jesus' whole life is a life of silence, defined by parables.</p><p>AND HE TOOK IT AND DID EAT BEFORE THEM.… Only then could they
believe.</p><p>It is said that when he ate, then they recognized him because of the
way, the manner. Nobody else could eat like Jesus. They had watched him
eating with them for many years. Just three days before, there was the
Last Supper. The manner of this man was totally different; it was not
like anybody else. Whenever he ate, he would eat in such a prayerful
mood, in such deep gratefulness, in such infinite delight, with such joy
-- his eating was a celebration.</p><p>Only when he ate could they understand -- 'Yes, this seems to be our
Jesus, because nobody else can bring such quality to such ordinary
things as eating.'</p><p>Whatsoever he touched became holy, wherever he moved became holy
ground.</p><p>I have heard an anecdote: An impressive dinner was given by a
literary society in Milwaukee. At the conclusion Madame Mordjeska asked
if she might not express her appreciation by giving a short Polish
recitation. Otis Skinner, one of the guests, describes what she did:'Her
liquid voice became by turns melancholy and gay; impatient, tragic,
light with happiness and blighting with bitterness. There was not a note
in the gamut of emotions she did not touch. She finished</p><p>with a recurrent rhythm, fateful and portentious. We were clutched by
the spell. We did not know what it was about, but we knew it was
something tremendous.</p><p>Someone asked what it was. She answered with a sly smile,'I merely
recited the alphabet.'</p><p>But if you know how to sing, even an alphabet can become a tremendous
song. If you know how to sing, if you know how to dance, then any
movement of your body becomes tremendously meaningful. Then each gesture
becomes graceful.</p><p>Then each gesture exhibits something, manifests something of the
unknown. Even an ordinary alphabet can become tremendously
significant.</p><p>Jesus knew how to eat, he knew how to live, he knew how to love. Even
the ordinary act of eating food became totally different -- the quality
of it. Nobody else has ever eaten that way, walked that way, looked that
way. He had to Come down to the most ordinary thing only because he
hoped that his disciples might be able to recognize. And they
recognized.</p><p>THEN OPENED HE THEIR UNDERSTANDING, THAT THEY MIGHT UNDERSTAND THE
SCRIPTURES.…</p><p>Once they recognized, they were happy. Why did he try? Why did he
make any effort? -- so that they might understand the scriptures. The
scriptures go. on saying that you are deathless; all the scriptures of
the world. It has, nothing to do with the scriptures of the Jews alone;
all the scriptures of the world go on saying that you are deathless.
Nobody except Jesus had given such a proof of it. Nobody had come after
death to give witness that those scriptures were right. Not even a
Buddha had given that proof; not even a Krishna had given that proof. It
is unique to Jesus to come back from the doors of death, to descend back
into the world, to become a witness to all scriptures. Jesus is the very
embodiment of the foundational law of life: that everything is eternal
and immortal, that nothing dies, that nothing can die; that there is
only one thing that is a lie, and that is death. Only death is
impossible and everything else is possible.</p><p>THEN OPENED HE THEIR UNDERSTANDING, THAT THEY MIGHT</p><p>UNDERSTAND THE SCRIPTURES... the message of centuries, the one and
only message of all religion -- that you are deathless... AND SAID UNTO
THEM: THUS IT IS WRITTEN,. AND THUS IT BEHOVED CHRIST TO SUFFER, AND</p><p>TO RISE FROM THE DEAD THE THIRD DAY.</p><p>This is very meaningful. Whenever you die, if you die unconsciously
-- as everybody almost always dies -- then within three days you are
reincarnated in a new body, you enter a womb. That's why in India the
third day after anybody's death is very significant, because the third
day is symbolic that person is reborn, has somewhere taken birth. If you
die consciously, which only a Buddha. or a Jesus does, then it is up to
you. You are not going to be born again in any other womb. Then it is up
to you; you are totally free. If you want to descend, you can use the
old body; if you don't want to descend back, you can disappear into the
whole. In Jesus' case the old body was saved. After his crucification
his body was put in a cave and the door of the cave was blocked by a
rock. Now it is a mystery what happened, because the body disappeared
from there.</p><p>Jesus belonged to a certain sect called Essenes. Jesus himself was
trained by the Essenes, he was a disciple in their school. They had
worked for him, they were his' Masters, they had prepared him. The
Essenes were an esoteric group working almost in secret. When Jesus was
crucified, they removed his body, they protected his body for three
days. They helped, because if the body is not protected then the soul
cannot descend back.</p><p>In India, we burn the body precisely for this purpose, so that the
soul cannot enter into the old body. There is a tendency, even in
unconscious souls -- a clinging to the old, a fear of the new. And if
there is a choice between the old body and a new child's body in a womb,
your mind will choose your old body.</p><p>And there is a fear that the soul may enter back into the body, and
that body is useless now rotten, old. It has to be dropped and changed.
That's why in India we burn the body immediately, so that there is no
possibility of the body being there for the soul to enter into. In any
accident it should not be allowed. Only the bodies of saints, of people
who die consciously, are not burned in India. They are preserved in
special graves we call SAMADHIS. It is the same word we use for the
fourth state of consciousness, of transcendence. We call the grave of a
saint</p><p>'samadhi'. His body is preserved there as a link. People who cannot
be in direct contact with the saint can come to the body, and the body
can function as a medium. Through the body they can still be in contact
with the soul which has been lost into the whole, and they can be
helped.</p><p>Jesus' body was preserved for three days by the Essenes, one of the
most important groups on the earth, one of the most important esoteric
groups. After three days Jesus entered his body again. Three days is a
time limit. One needs to be out of the body for three days to be
completely purified of all grossness, of all dust that clings to one's
consciousness and soul.</p><p>THUS IT IS WRITTEN, AND THUS IT BEHOVE CHRIST TO SUFFER, AND TO</p><p>RISE FROM THE DEAD THE THIRD DAY. And it was a prophecy in the old
scriptures that this would happen: the third day Christ would come back,
just to show that life is immortal.</p><p>AND THAT REPENTENCE AND REMISSION OF SINS SHOULD BE PREACHED IN HIS
NAME AMONG ALL NATIONS, BEGINNING AT JERUSALEM.</p><p>AND YE ARE WITNESSES OF THESE THINGS.</p><p>'And repentance and remission of sins': Jesus gave a proof that death
is just a false notion. Nothing dies. Why is this proof needed? Because
if the soul is immortal, then your whole life will have to be
transformed. Then you will have to arrange your life in a totally
different light. If only this life is all -- you begin with birth and
you end with death -- then what is the meaning of virtue or sin?</p><p>Whatsoever you do is irrelevant; one day everybody dies, sinner and
saint. Dust unto dust -- nothing remain so what is the difference
between virtue and sin? If life is mortal, then there is no difference.
Then it is just a social utility, a convenience, but nothing of much
importance.</p><p>But if the soul remains, if nothing dies, then there is a tremendous
difference between virtue and sin. Virtue means: to live as if you are
to live forever; sin means: to live without any consciousness of your
eternity. Sin means to live in</p><p>unconsciousness, virtue means to live in awareness.</p><p>If you become aware, you become aware of the deathless within
you.</p><p>If you are unconscious, unaware, you are living only in the body, the
mortal.</p><p>And a person who lives for the body, in the body, and only for the
body, lives in sin. Jesus gave the proof.</p><p>AND THAT REPENTANCE AND REMISSION OF THE SINS SHOULD BE PREACHED IN
HIS NAME AMONG ALL NATIONS, BEGINNING AT JERUSALEM.</p><p>And he said to his disciples,'Now go and spread whatsoever you have
seen all over the earth. Go and tell everybody on the earth. Spread the
good news that there is no death, that one man has proved that life is
eternal, that one man has come back from death, that one man has proved
that death can be conquered.</p><p>And if you become a witness,' he said to his disciples,'you will be
able to persuade people not to live in sin, not to live in
unconsciousness. Tell them to repent for whatsoever they have done in
the past, to ask forgiveness for it. And tell them, because you have
been a witness, that the impossible has become possible: death can be
conquered, because death does not exist. Tell them that if they ask,
they will be forgiven.'</p><p>Christianity, the whole of Christianity depends on this simple
sentence:'If you repent, you can be forgiven.' Christianity is unique in
this sense. No other religion, particularly Indian religions, talk of
repentance and forgiveness. They are more scientific, in fact, more
technological. They say: You have done something wrong, you have to undo
it. You have to do something good, you have to keep everything in
balance. Nobody can forgive you; you have to change your life, your
karmas, your actions.</p><p>Christianity has a tremendously beautiful concept of forgiveness.
Christianity says: If you ask to be forgiven from your deepest core, you
will be forgiven.</p><p>Why? Is there somebody who can forgive you?, No, but if you ask in
intense passion to be forgiven, the very idea of repentance becomes
forgiveness. If you</p><p>have really asked, realized that you have done something wrong; if it
has been a total realization and you accept the responsibility that it
was wrong and that you are ready to repent for it, and you repent
wholeheartedly, the very repentance becomes the forgiveness. Then there
is no need to do anything else, because all sins are nothing but
unconscious acts. Repentance makes you conscious, alert.</p><p>Sin is like darkness. You bring a light, a lamp into darkness and
darkness disappears.</p><p>Sin is because you are asleep.</p><p>If you repent, you awake yourself. Because there is no other way to
repent unless you awake yourself, unless you come to realize and see
what you have been doing, how you have been living, how you have been
wasting, how you have been hurting. When you come to realize it, a flame
starts burning in you, an awareness; and in that awareness, in that
light, darkness disappears. It is not that there is a God personified
sitting somewhere on a throne in heaven who goes on forgiving you. There
is nobody to forgive you. But if you repent, you will be forgiven.</p><p>God is not a person; God is the totality. God is existence, the
totality of being. It is not that you have to pray to Him so that He can
forgive, no. In your praying you are forgiven. The very prayer, the very
recognition that you have been wrong and you recognize it and you
repent, is enough. All that you have been up to then is, wiped, washed.
You are cleansed of it. The old is gone, the new is born.</p><p>This is resurrection.</p><p>AND THAT REPENTANCE AND REMISSION OF SINS SHOULD BE PREACHED IN HIS
NAME AMONG ALL NATIONS, BEGINNING AT JERUSALEM.</p><p>AND YE ARE WITNESSES OF THESE THINGS.</p><p>And Jesus told them,'You have witnessed the greatest thing that has
ever happened: the resurrection. Now go and spread the good news to
those who were not fortunate enough to be here. Go to the housetops and
tell everybody.'</p><p>And those disciples went all over the earth. They carried authority.
They had seen something which nobody had seen before them. In their eyes
you could see the reflection of Jesus coming back from death. In each of
their gestures you could feel the presence of Jesus: they had seen, they
had become witnesses to something. They carried authority. They created
a great movement; beginning in Jerusalem it spread all over the earth.
It is just as you throw a pebble in a silent lake: it falls at a certain
point and then ripples arise, and ripples go to the farthest shores.</p><p>Jesus is a whole art of inner transformation. I say art, I don't say
science. When I talk on Patanjali, I can say that whatsoever Patanjali
says is a science. When I talk on Buddha, I can say that whatsoever
Buddha says is a psychology. But not with Jesus. He has given an art,
because he has given love, not law. If you understand Jesus, by and by,
you will become aware that it is not a question of following a certain
rule. Rather, it is a question of following a quality of love. Love is
the only thing that transcends death, because love is the only thing
that life exists for.</p><p>Love is the very center of being. If you love, all is forgiven. If
you love, you have repented. If you love, one day or other you yourself
will become a witness that there is no death.</p><p>Accept Jesus' invitation. He is not going to take anything from you.
He is going to take only that which you don't have, and he is going to
give you life abundant, life eternal.</p><p>But don't be bothered about Christianity much. Jesus has been
murdered twice.</p><p>Once he was murdered in Jerusalem by Jews, but they could not murder
him. He survived. After the third day he resurrected. Then he was
murdered in Rome, in the Vatican. And they murdered him more
efficiently, of course, because they knew that this man had once come
out of death. Jews crucified him not knowing that this man could come
out of death, so they did not take all the precautions.</p><p>Christians killed this man again with all the precautions, and Jesus
has not been able to come out again.</p><p>Don't be bothered about Christianity. Christianity has nothing to do
with Christ. Jesus is available to all. Jesus is for those who are ready
to transform</p><p>themselves; Jesus is an art of inner transformation, of rebirth.
Listen to his invitation. He still goes on saying,'Come, follow me.'</p><h1 style=padding-top:3pt;text-indent:0;text-align:center id=table-of-contents>Table of Contents</h1><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part1>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a></p><p>  </p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://osho.lol/posts/be_still_and_know/part5/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Chapter title: He Died in Samadhi</span>

‌Chapter title: Between Adam and Jesus‌ 22 December 1975 am in Buddha Hall The first question:
Question 1
IN JESUS&#39; PRAYER &#39;OUR FATHER&#39;, DOES GOD LEAD US INTO TEMPTATION?
IT is a very subtle question, and you will have to be utterly attentive to understand it.
God is good. He cannot lead you into temptation, but His very goodness leads you into temptation. The goodness of God is something which is already there.</description>

WHEN YOU MEET A MAN WHO IS NOT A POET, DO NOT SHOW HIM YOUR POEM.”\nManeesha, the way of Zen requires certain conditions to be fulfilled. They are not the conditions that other religions require; they are the conditions of receptivity, of awareness, of listening, of an\nunderstanding of the wordless, a deep penetration into silence. No other religion asks you these things. They want you to be virtuous, to be moral, not to indulge in adultery. Their requirements are very superficial.\nZen requires real qualities of being. Only then the master can impart his understanding of the ultimate. In other words, Zen is not a theology, but a being-to-being communion. The disciple has to rise to the same height as the master, otherwise he will miss whatever is being said to him. These qualities will bring him very close to the height of the master.\nA master certainly knows at what height you are and he speaks accordingly. He never wastes a single word or a single moment.\nManeesha has brought this small anecdote, which will explain to you what Rinzai, who was the founder of Zen in Japan, is about.\nWHEN RINZAI ONCE VISITED HORIN, HORIN SAID: “INTO THE SEA THE MOONLIGHT FALLS CLEAR AND SHADOWLESS, BUT THE WANTON FISH DECEIVE THEMSELVES.”\nRINZAI COMMENTED: “IF THE MOONLIGHT ON THE SEA IS WITHOUT SHADOWS, HOW CAN THE FISH BE DECEIVED?”\nAll deception is taking the shadow for the real. But strangely enough – perhaps you have never observed it – a shadow itself cannot cast a shadow. Hence the ancient law that if you see a man without a shadow, remember he is a ghost, because a real man will have a shadow. Only a man who appears as a man but is transparent – you can pass your hand through him and you will not touch anything – will not make any shadow.\nThe reflection of the moon in the lake is a shadow itself. How can it cast a shadow? That is impossible. But what Horin wanted to say is not anything unnecessary or non-essential.\nHe said, “INTO THE SEA, THE MOONLIGHT FALLS CLEAR AND SHADOWLESS, BUT THE WANTON FISH DECEIVE THEMSELVES.”\nWhat do they deceive themselves about? What is their deception? What is their illusion? Their illusion is to take the reflection as the real moon.\nBut RINZAI COMMENTED: “IF THE MOONLIGHT ON THE SEA IS WITHOUT SHADOWS, HOW CAN THE FISH BE DECEIVED?”\nThe fish can certainly be deceived, because even men are deceived by shadows. Rinzai’s question is clear and from a height of consciousness. Everybody in the world is deceived by shadows. What are all your imaginations? What are all your dreams?\nHave you ever considered the fact that while dreaming you never think that this is unreal? While awake you may think perhaps that all you are saying is unreal, only a dream; but in a dream you can never think that it is a dream, for the simple reason that if you are so much aware as to experience the dream as a dream, the dream will stop. Dreaming can continue only in a very unconscious, unaware state.\nThe real question is not about the fish. The fish is only a symbol. The real question is about the man.\n“IF THE MOONLIGHT ON THE SEA IS WITHOUT SHADOWS, HOW CAN THE FISH BE DECEIVED?”\nThere is only one way for the fish to be deceived, and that is to take the reflection as the real moon.\nHorin missed the point. He started explaining why the fish gets caught into a deception. That was not what Rinzai wanted him to do. For him the fish was not the point at all, neither was the reflection of the moon. His concern was this, that what to say about a fish, even men are deceived by shadows – and not only in dreams, but in actual life when they are awake. Every day you continue to get deceived, but you are not aware, hence it does not hurt you and your dignity.\nYou see a woman as very beautiful – and she is certainly beautiful, but where does that beauty go after the honeymoon? Then you want to kill the same woman for whom you were ready to die one day.\nYou can appreciate other women’s beauty, but I have never heard of any husband appreciating his own wife’s beauty. Perhaps what he saw was not the real woman as she is; he saw the woman as he wanted to see her.\nIt was a dream projection, and a dream projection cannot be prolonged for long. Sooner or later the dream projection drops away, and suddenly you see the real person. Nothing has changed: the woman is the same, the man is the same, but neither the woman thinks you are the same man she fell in love with, nor do you think she is the same woman you had fallen in love with.\nWhat happened? Just within a week... and if you are intelligent enough, then just over the weekend. It depends on intelligence. The idiots can live out their whole lives. The more intelligent a person is, the sooner he will see his projections, imaginations dropping, the clouds disappearing, and he will see the pure sky without any clouds – and it is going to change his opinion.\nRinzai is saying that we are all living in shadow. You think, you project, you imagine, you dream. The greatest lovers in the world were those who never met; their love is eternal. People sing songs of Siri and Farhad, of Laila and Majnu, of Soni and Mahival, and the only reason why their love is remembered is that they were never allowed by their parents and the society to be together.\nIf Laila and Majnu had got married, you would never have heard their names. Have you ever heard any story, any poetry concerning a married couple? I at least have searched enough, and I have not found it. It seems to be intrinsically impossible, because as they come close, their projections start falling. If they are kept away, forced to be apart, then their dreams become even more beautiful. Their imagination takes wings.\nAnd not only in this matter but in other matters also, you live in shadows, in your hopes. What have you got in your hopes? Just empty imagination that tomorrow something will happen that has not happened up to now, and you will feel fulfilled. It never happens. What happens tomorrow is death, and death creates fear for a simple reason you may not be aware of.\nThe fear of death is that it takes the future out of your hands. You have been living in the future in your imagination, and death comes and puts a full stop. No more tomorrow. The future is simply your idea of how things should be. The existence has no obligation to you to fulfill your desires and your hopes. People even give promises, people say to each other, “I will love you my whole life,” not knowing at all that the whole life is a long thing.\nOne man was saying to his girlfriend, “I will love you my whole life.”\nThen for a moment he became silent, and the woman said, “Why have you become silent suddenly?”\nHe said, “Just tell me one thing. In your old age, will you start looking like your mother? – because then I cannot give that promise. Suddenly I thought, ‘What am I saying? In the old age this woman is going to look like the mother-in-law!’” And mother-in-laws... it is just strange that people don’t shoot them.\nI have heard, a hunter was going into the forest for hunting. His wife insisted on going and she also insisted on taking his mother-in-law. Not to create any trouble he said, “Okay, there is no harm in it. You can sit in the top of a tree and you can see.”\nThe mother-in-law was not too old to climb a tree, so she was sitting in a small tree when a lion came near. The wife saw it from her tall tree and shouted to her husband, “Just see, one lion is very close to my mother.”\nThe husband said, “It is not my problem, it is the lion’s problem. Now he has got into trouble. If he wants to get out, he will get out. You just keep quiet.”\nPeople expect something, and it is never fulfilled. There is always frustration all around. People are living in despair, and the reason is that what they expected... existence has no desire, no reason to go according to their expectations. If you want to be happy, go along with existence and its ends wherever it takes you.\nThat’s what I mean by let-go: you simply drop your projections, your imaginations, and let the existence take hold of your whole life. Then there is no despair, because there is no possibility of being frustrated. There is no anguish and no anxiety; you are relaxed with existence. Whatever happens, that is good.\nThe whole existence is wiser than you, so whatever happens – Buddha says suchness – just whatever happens, remember, such is the nature of existence. Don’t stand aloof and against existence; be part, and feel a certain oneness.\nThat oneness can be called suchness, or isness, or thisness, but the meaning is that whatever happens is good. You have to find out the beauty of it and the joy of it. Only such a man can be blissful; otherwise there is always the feeling of being deceived.\nEvery man – out of a thousand, perhaps one man dies without the idea that he has been deceived by life. Almost everybody dies with the idea, “What was it? Seventy years I struggled; what is the game?” All your expectations are shattered, all your dreams are broken, all your promises remain unfulfilled. You are dying a bankrupt.\nAlmost everybody dies a bankrupt as far as his expectations are concerned. Only a man of let-go is not deceived by anything. He takes everything that comes in the way happily and joyously, and if things change, he allows the change without any hindrance, without creating any barriers to prevent the change. Such a man knows no deceptions. He knows life has never deceived him, but has always fulfilled those longings which he was not even aware of.\nHORIN THEN SAID: “SEEING THERE IS WIND, WAVES ARISE; PLAYING WITH THE WATER, THE ROUGH SAIL FLAPS.”\nHe did not understand that Rinzai was not talking about the fish, and he is trying to explain his own statement without listening to what Rinzai has raised as a question.\nRINZAI SAID: “THE FROG IN THE MOON SHINES BRIGHTLY ALONE, AND ALL RIVERS AND HILLS ARE AT PEACE. THE LONG BREATH OF THE WIND IS THE VOICE OF AUTUMN IN EARTH AND SKY.”\nEverything is as it should be. So peaceful are the hills in the full moon night... rivers are at peace, dancing in the full moon night. Because of their dance the full moon’s reflection becomes a silver spread over all. Everything is silent and peaceful, there is no frustration in the hills, there is no frustration in the rivers. Even the frog in the moon shines brightly alone.\nIf you look at nature, just taking man and his mind away, everything is bliss, everything is buddha. It is only man’s mind that creates trouble, because it cannot allow a let-go.\nTHE LONG BREATH OF THE WIND IS THE VOICE OF AUTUMN IN EARTH AND SKY.\nAnd there is great joy that autumn is coming. The moon is full of blissfulness and all that shines in the moonlight, except man...\nMan can also be as happy as the hills and as peaceful as the rivers if he looks at the moon and the surroundings without any mind. With no thought, he will also become part of the whole scene.\nBut man remains always concerned with his own stupid ideas. When the whole existence is rejoicing, it is only man who is worried. Have you ever seen a tree worried? No animal is ever worried. Even in dying, it dies peacefully. Such is the way of existence, that anything that is born is going to die.\nBut man’s mind intrudes, always creates problems, because it expects things to be different than they are. He is not ready to accept the suchness of existence; he wants it according to him. This, according to him, is the whole misery. Everybody is trying that everything should be according to him. One may say it, one may not say it, but even without saying it, your mind is weaving thoughts about how things should be brought according to YOUR idea – and this is impossible.\nYou cannot change existence.\nAll that you can do is drop your mind.\nHORIN SAID: “THOUGH YOU MAY SPREAD YOUR THREE INCHES OF TONGUE, AND ILLUMINATE THE CELESTIAL QUIETNESS, JUST TRY AND SAY A SINGLE WORD TO FIT THE OCCASION!”\nRINZAI RESPONDED – and his response is of fundamental importance: “WHEN YOU MEET A MASTER SWORDSMAN, SHOW HIM YOUR SWORD. WHEN YOU MEET A MAN WHO IS NOT A POET, DO NOT SHOW HIM YOUR POEM.”\nEach according to his worth, each according to his receptivity. You are not yet able to receive one word and understand it. I cannot recite a poem to you, because you will not understand it; you will certainly misunderstand.\nI have heard, a thief was brought into the court, and the judge said, “Why have you entered this man’s house?”\nThe poor thief said, “I have entered to steal something. But the man was so strange: he caught hold of me, and when I tried hard to escape he said, ‘Don’t be worried, just sit down and listen. I have written a new poem.’ I thought it was better to listen silently, but the poem went on and on and on. And he was holding me by the hand, so this way the whole night he tortured me. I didn’t understand a single word of what he was saying, and I could not escape either.\n“By the morning the police came, and now I am standing here before you with only one hope: that you will not give me the punishment to listen to this poet again. I am ready even to go to the gallows. I had no idea that this house belongs to a poet, otherwise I would not have entered.”\nPoets are like that. It is very difficult for them to find audiences. They go on searching around to see if they can find somebody, and everybody goes on running away saying, “I have to do some special work. Right now I am not available.” Who wants to waste time?\n“Unless you are a poet,” Rinzai is saying, “don’t say anything to a person who is not worthy of it, because that is insulting him, that is degrading him, that is taking his dignity, that is bringing up his unworthiness. So don’t ask me for a single word; you are not yet capable of receiving it. You have not understood a single thing, and you went on explaining. You are not a fish and you don’t know what goes on in the mind of the fish.\n“Talk about man and talk about his deceptions, and find out the reason why he gets deceived. It is his own resistance to existence, and an effort to give a mold to the whole life – which is not possible. He is trying the impossible and goes on failing.”\nThis failure is not just his mistake. It is not that he has not been doing rightly; whatever he does he will be a failure. Nobody can be wiser than the cosmic existence. So the wise people allow themselves to go along with the existential river, not even asking, “Where are we going?”\nExistence is going nowhere. It is simply here, just playing with thousands of forms, thousands of situations, creating more and more consciousness, more and more happiness, more and more love. If it is not happening to you, it simply means you are keeping your doors closed.\nJust open your heart and relax with existence and suddenly you will see, THE FROG IN THE MOON SHINES BRIGHTLY ALONE. No company is needed, no richness is needed – just a poor frog. No political position is needed – and all rivers and hills are at peace. They don’t have anything, but they have peace, which you cannot purchase.\nTHE LONG BREATH OF THE WIND IS THE VOICE OF AUTUMN IN EARTH AND SKY. Just be\nwith existence wherever it is going and you will be unworried. Your tensions will disappear. You will be as happy as a child, you will be as beautiful as a flower.\nIkkyu wrote:\nWHEN YOU BREAK UP A CHERRY TREE AND LOOK,\nTHERE ARE NO FLOWERS AT ALL; THE FLOWERS ARE BROUGHT BY THE SPRING WIND.\nEVEN THOUGH YOU SOAR BOUNDLESSLY EVEN BEYOND THE CLOUDS,\nJUST DON’T RELY ON\nTHE TEACHINGS OF GAUTAMA.\nTwo things Ikkyu is saying: one, you cannot bring the flowers, which will come in their own time. You have to wait, you have to be patient. You cannot ask, “Why are the cherry flowers not coming?” The tree is there, you are watering the treeYou can even, Ikkyu says, break up a cherry tree and look\ninside the tree to find where the flowers are hidden. There are no flowers at all.\nThe flowers are brought by the spring wind. Let the spring come, let the right moment and the climate and the right wind reach the cherry tree. It will blossom suddenly, it will explode into immense beauty.\nThe cherry tree is waiting; it is not in a hurry, it is not running somewhere to catch up with spring. It is simply waiting silently, joyously. Spring comes; even if it is a day or two late, what does it matter? It has always been coming.\nThe second thing Ikkyu says: EVEN THOUGH YOU SOAR BOUNDLESSLY EVEN BEYOND THE CLOUDS, JUST DON’T RELY ON THE TEACHINGS OF GAUTAMA. That can be said only by the Zen masters about their own originator: “Don’t rely on Gautama the Buddha’s teachings” – because his teachings were in a different context. He was talking to a different kind of people. You may not be that kind of person at all, and the times have changed; those teachings may be no more relevant.\nOnly rely on your own consciousness. Even Gautama’s consciousness is not reliable. He is not saying that Gautama is wrong; he is saying that Gautama was dealing with situations fifteen hundred years before.\nI have told you of an instance when just in a single day... In the morning a man asked Gautam Buddha, “Is there a God?”\nAnd Gautama said, “No, there is no God.”\nIn the afternoon another man asked, “What do you think about God?” Gautama said, “Yes, God is.”\nYou can understand the trouble Ananda, who was continuously with him, was in. He started having a migraine. What kind of man is this? In the morning he says, “There is no God,” and in the afternoon he has forgotten completely, and he is saying, “There is God.”\nHe waited for the time in the night when there would be nobody around, but before that a third person came in the evening, sat down and asked Gautama, “I have no conception either for or against God. Just help me to understand.”\nAnd Gautam Buddha did not say anything to the man, but on the contrary simply closed his eyes, remained silent. Seeing this, the other man also closed his eyes and sat. He thought perhaps Buddha was going to say something in his silence and they both remained in silence for two hours.\nThe man felt so beautiful and so fresh and so young, so rejuvenated, that after two hours he opened his eyes and he was a changed man. He touched Gautam Buddha’s feet, thanked him and told him, “I was not expecting that much. You have given me more than I had asked. You have given me a taste. I had come only to ask a question; you have taken me to the experience itself. I will remain grateful to you my whole life.”\nIn the night Ananda said, “You should at least think of me. The whole day I have been in such a trouble. What kind of man are you? In the morning you say no, in the afternoon you say yes, in the evening you don’t say anything, but just remain silent – and that fellow gets the answer and you have not said anything.”\nBuddha said, “The first man, to whom I said, ‘There is no God,’ was an atheist, and he had come to get a confirmation of his atheism, that if Gautam Buddha also is an atheist, then there is no problem. Atheism is certainly the right approach. There is no God.\n“The second man had also come for confirmation of his own prejudice. He was a theist and he wanted support. They were not seekers, they were only asking for consolation. They had already got the idea; they were simply asking me to support their ideas. They were satisfied with their ideas without ever moving into any new space.\n“But the third man was really a seeker. He plainly said, ‘I don’t have any idea for or against.’ For such a man only silence is the answer. And because he had no prejudice, seeing me closing my\neyes and becoming silent, he immediately understood the hint. He closed his eyes and he went deep into silence. Although I had not said anything to him, he went away immensely richer than he had come.\n“And Ananda,” Buddha said, “you should not be disturbed, because none of these questions were yours. It is not your problem.”\nAnanda said, “It is not my problem, but I have ears and I am always close to you.”\nBuddha said, “You will have to learn that I don’t have any fixed philosophy so that I can hand over immediately ready-made answers. I have to see the person, his capacity. I don’t want to insult anybody. I don’t want to give something which they cannot understand, which is going to be over their heads.”\nIf this was the situation in Buddha’s own time, Ikkyu is right: JUST DON’T RELY ON THE TEACHINGS OF GAUTAMA. Find out your own sources. Go deeper into your own being. You will find there the affirmation of Gautam Buddha.\nBut don’t rely on the teachings. Just don’t sit with the scriptures, reading them for years, studying them for years. That is not going to help. Gautam Buddha had not read those scriptures before he became enlightened, so it is absolutely certain that they cannot be the cause of anybody’s enlightenment. Just do what he did; don’t be too much concerned what he said. Whatever he said was meant for his contemporaries, for his time, for the people he was talking to.\nDo what Buddha did. He became a no-mind, and becoming a no-mind, you will have to throw even Buddha and his scriptures out of your being. Only in this emptiness is there a possibility of the cherry blossoms of your being coming from the potential to the actual. You can bring the spring by bringing the no-mind.\nAs no-mind comes, thousands of miracles follow. But don’t desire those miracles; if you start desiring them, you will never have the no-mind, because those desires will not allow the mind to be empty.\nSo remember, it is one of the most significant things for a seeker that he should not become too much concerned about the search. He should remain playful. “If there is a truth in existence, some day, somewhere I am going to encounter it.”\nBut don’t be serious, just be playful. In playfulness you are relaxed, and in relaxation, utter relaxation, you will find Gautam Buddha himself, so why bother about his teachings? When you can find Gautam Buddha himself, then why bother about dead scriptures? Ikkyu is right, absolutely right.\nQuestion 1\nManeesha has asked a question:\nOUR BELOVED MASTER,\nIS THE WITNESS A PRESENCE OR SIMPLY AN ABSENCE – THE ABSENCE OF IDENTIFICATION WITH BODY AND MIND?\nManeesha, it is a difficult question – difficult only because your mind never accepts contradictions, and existence absolutely is in favor of contradictions. In fact, existence is made of contradictions. So these two words, presence and absence, are both right.\nIn the witness there is absence, certainly, of your personality, of your mind, of your thoughts, feelings – anything that you are carrying within your mind is absent. If you look from this side, it appears that no-mind is empty mind.\nBut the moment all these things are emptied out, the potential of your being starts growing – a new presence which was hindered from growing by all the furniture that you have been carrying in the mind. Now that all that furniture and all those stones are thrown and the soil is ready, there comes a new presence.\nSo both are there as far as your mind is concerned. Meditation is an effort of creating absence. But when the mind is really absent, in that silence, in that unlimited space, your potential starts glowing, radiating, flowering. Suddenly you are full of cherry blossoms, a new presence, a new fragrance.\nSo absence and presence are both together in your meditation. On the one hand you are emptying, on the other hand the empty space is being filled with your potential. Before there was no space for it to blossom.\nMeditation is simply creating a space for your potential to come to flower. A man of meditation has such a presence that you can feel it.\nIn my dining room I have got a small statue of Buddha. It is only a statue, but when Jayesh came for the first time and saw it, he said, “This statue has a great presence.” I have loved that statue and carried it from India to America, from America to India, because it has a presence. It is only a statue, but a statue of a meditating buddha. Something of meditation in that very posture radiates a very alive aura.\nI have brought another statue for your Buddha Auditorium, to be placed just at the gate, so you can see that even a statue, because it is in a meditative posture, radiates something. Just sitting by the side of the statue you will find something flowing from the statue towards you. It is not a worship, it is just being silently close and watching the posture. Because the posture is of meditation, something of meditativeness radiates even from the stone.\nSo when you are meditating, you are doing both the things: on one hand you are throwing away all that is garbage, and on the other hand you are helping roses to blossom. You will have an absence and you will have a great presence, together: absence of all that was ugly in you, and presence of all that is beautiful.\nIt is time for Sardar Gurudayal Singh. I hope he is still in his rainbow-colored turban. That turban has a special presence!\nIt is the farewell party at the White House for Ronald and Nancy Reagan. Everybody gets pretty drunk and Nancy Reagan offers to give George Bush, the president-elect, a private tour of the presidential bedroom.\nWhen they get back to the party, George Bush looks for Ronald Reagan and finds him slumped on a couch, fast asleep.\n“Hey, Ronald,” says Bush, shaking Reagan roughly. “Do you have any pictures of Nancy in the nude?”\n“What?” mumbles Reagan, in shock. “You idiot! Of course I don’t!” “Okay,” says Bush, holding up his camera. “Wanna buy some?”\nDoris and Jeff Dull have been married for six years and have three kids. But Jeff has a strange habit – he will only make love with the lights off.\nDoris puts up with this for as long as she can, but one night her curiosity gets the better of her. She and Jeff are making love in the usual way when suddenly she snaps the light on, and to her horror, she sees that Jeff is making love to her using a cucumber.\n“You impotent wimp!” shouts Doris. “So this is why you never wanted the lights on! It’s disgusting – explain yourself!”\n“Okay, dear,” says Jeff, calmly. “I can explain the cucumber, if you can explain our three kids!”\nAdolf Hitler pushes the doorbell at the Pearly Gates of Heaven and demands to be admitted. He kicks up such a fuss that Saint Peter calls Jesus to come and deal with the situation.\n“I want to come in,” cries the Fuhrer, “and I will reward you highly if you let me stay.”\n“What do you mean?” asks Jesus. “You cannot possibly come in. Just look at what you did on earth!”\n“Look,” says Hitler, taking Jesus to one side, “if you let me in, I will personally present you with Germany’s highest award for bravery, the Iron Cross.”\n“Really?” says Jesus. “That’s a very tempting offer. Just let me make one phone call.”\nSo Jesus calls up God the Father. “Dad,” says Jesus, “I’ve got Adolf Hitler here at the Pearly Gates, and he wants to come in. What do you think?”\n“Jesus Christ!” shouts God. “Are you kidding? The guy is a psychopath!”\n“I know, Dad,” says Jesus, “but you see, he has made me this terrific offer. He wants to give me the Iron Cross!”\n“The Iron Cross?” shouts God, in amazement. “You idiot! Look what happened when you got that wooden one!”\nNivedano... (Drumbeat)\n(Gibberish) Nivedano... (Drumbeat)\nBe silent. Close your eyes. Feel your body to be completely frozen.\nNow look inwards with your total life energy, with your total consciousness, and with an urgency as if this is going to be the last moment of your life.\nOnly with urgency can you reach to the center of your being, and at the center of your being you are the buddha. To realize this is to create the right space for all kinds of transformations in your life. Let this experience sink into every fiber of your being.\nThe buddha has only one quality, and that quality is witnessing. The buddha is made of witnessing, of watching. Just watch, and in your very watching your buddhahood deepens.\nThis evening, this moment you are the most fortunate ones on the earth, because to be a buddha is to be a Himalayan Everest of consciousness. Then you don’t have to follow any discipline, any morality. All that is good comes behind you like a shadow.\nJust remain a witness around the clock. Whatever you are doing, do it with full awareness and with a grace that shows that you have recognized the buddha in the deepest core of your being.\nTo make it more clear, Nivedano... (Drumbeat)\nJust watch, be a witness.\nYou are not the body, you are not the mind; you are simply the witnessing, and this witnessing is the buddha.\nThe spring has come and the cherry tree has blossomed into thousands of flowers. Collect as many flowers and as much of witnessing...\nPersuade the buddha to come from the hidden secrets of your life into the circumference, into your day-to-day life. He always has come, just the right persuasion is needed, and showing him your worthiness by witnessing.\nCollect as much of this relaxed moment, of this let-go, before Nivedano calls you back.\nThis moment the Buddha Auditorium is no more the gathering of ten thousand buddhas. It has become a lake of tremendous consciousness without any ripples. You are the fish in the ocean. Don’t ask where the ocean is.\nNivedano... (Drumbeat)\nCome back, and bring your buddha with you. Silently and gracefully, sit for a few moments just to remember where you have been, what golden path you have followed, what your center is like.\nThe silence, the beauty, the blissfulness – you have to spread it on your circumference in every action, in every gesture, in every word, in every silence. You should remain a buddha in spite of any situation.\nBeing with me, you have got an opportunity which is no more available anywhere on the earth. It used to be available in many, many places. Those golden days have passed.\nMy effort is to give you a glimpse of those golden days when thousands of people in different places were trying to reach to the ultimate consciousness, to immortality, to eternity.\nWithout reaching to your center you are a cherry tree which will never find its spring. The moment you reach to your center you allow the spring to come to you. Your whole life becomes a dance, a poetry, a song.\nOkay, Maneesha? Yes, Beloved Master.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"5698","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/rinzai_master_of_the_irrational/part6/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/rinzai_master_of_the_irrational/>Rinzai.

MOONLIGHT FALLS CLEAR AND SHADOWLESS, BUT THE WANTON FISH DECEIVE
THEMSELVES.”</p><p><br></p><p>RINZAI COMMENTED: “IF THE MOONLIGHT ON THE SEA IS WITHOUT SHADOWS,
HOW CAN THE FISH BE DECEIVED?”</p><p><br></p><p>HORIN THEN SAID: “SEEING THERE IS WIND, WAVES ARISE; PLAYING WITH THE
WATER, THE ROUGH SAIL FLAPS.”</p><p><br></p><p>RINZAI SAID: “THE FROG IN THE MOON SHINES BRIGHTLY ALONE, AND ALL
RIVERS AND HILLS ARE AT PEACE. THE LONG BREATH OF THE WIND IS THE VOICE
OF AUTUMN IN EARTH AND SKY.”</p><p><br></p><p>HORIN SAID: “THOUGH YOU MAY SPREAD YOUR THREE INCHES OF TONGUE, AND
ILLUMINATE THE CELESTIAL QUIETNESS, JUST TRY AND SAY A SINGLE WORD TO
FIT THE OCCASION!”</p><p><br></p><p>RINZAI RESPONDED: “WHEN YOU MEET A MASTER SWORDSMAN, SHOW HIM YOUR
SWORD. WHEN YOU MEET A MAN WHO IS NOT A POET, DO NOT SHOW HIM YOUR
POEM.”</p><p><br></p><p>Maneesha, the way of Zen requires certain conditions to be fulfilled.
They are not the conditions that other religions require; they are the
conditions of receptivity, of awareness, of listening, of an</p><p>understanding of the wordless, a deep penetration into silence. No
other religion asks you these things. They want you to be virtuous, to
be moral, not to indulge in adultery. Their requirements are very
superficial.</p><p><br></p><p>Zen requires real qualities of being. Only then the master can impart
his understanding of the ultimate. In other words, Zen is not a
theology, but a being-to-being communion. The disciple has to rise to
the same height as the master, otherwise he will miss whatever is being
said to him. These qualities will bring him very close to the height of
the master.</p><p><br></p><p>A master certainly knows at what height you are and he speaks
accordingly. He never wastes a single word or a single moment.</p><p><br></p><p>Maneesha has brought this small anecdote, which will explain to you
what Rinzai, who was the founder of Zen in Japan, is about.</p><p><br></p><p>WHEN RINZAI ONCE VISITED HORIN, HORIN SAID: “INTO THE SEA THE
MOONLIGHT FALLS CLEAR AND SHADOWLESS, BUT THE WANTON FISH DECEIVE
THEMSELVES.”</p><p><br></p><p>RINZAI COMMENTED: “IF THE MOONLIGHT ON THE SEA IS WITHOUT SHADOWS,
HOW CAN THE FISH BE DECEIVED?”</p><p><br></p><p>All deception is taking the shadow for the real. But strangely enough
– perhaps you have never observed it – a shadow itself cannot cast a
shadow. Hence the ancient law that if you see a man without a shadow,
remember he is a ghost, because a real man will have a shadow. Only a
man who appears as a man but is transparent – you can pass your hand
through him and you will not touch anything – will not make any
shadow.</p><p><br></p><p>The reflection of the moon in the lake is a shadow itself. How can it
cast a shadow? That is impossible. But what Horin wanted to say is not
anything unnecessary or non-essential.</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “INTO THE SEA, THE MOONLIGHT FALLS CLEAR AND SHADOWLESS, BUT
THE WANTON FISH DECEIVE THEMSELVES.”</p><p><br></p><p>What do they deceive themselves about? What is their deception? What
is their illusion? Their illusion is to take the reflection as the real
moon.</p><p><br></p><p>But RINZAI COMMENTED: “IF THE MOONLIGHT ON THE SEA IS WITHOUT
SHADOWS, HOW CAN THE FISH BE DECEIVED?”</p><p><br></p><p>The fish can certainly be deceived, because even men are deceived by
shadows. Rinzai’s question is clear and from a height of consciousness.
Everybody in the world is deceived by shadows. What are all your
imaginations? What are all your dreams?</p><p><br></p><p>Have you ever considered the fact that while dreaming you never think
that this is unreal? While awake you may think perhaps that all you are
saying is unreal, only a dream; but in a dream you can never think that
it is a dream, for the simple reason that if you are so much aware as to
experience the dream as a dream, the dream will stop. Dreaming can
continue only in a very unconscious, unaware state.</p><p>The real question is not about the fish. The fish is only a symbol.
The real question is about the man.</p><p><br></p><p>“IF THE MOONLIGHT ON THE SEA IS WITHOUT SHADOWS, HOW CAN THE FISH BE
DECEIVED?”</p><p><br></p><p>There is only one way for the fish to be deceived, and that is to
take the reflection as the real moon.</p><p><br></p><p>Horin missed the point. He started explaining why the fish gets
caught into a deception. That was not what Rinzai wanted him to do. For
him the fish was not the point at all, neither was the reflection of the
moon. His concern was this, that what to say about a fish, even men are
deceived by shadows – and not only in dreams, but in actual life when
they are awake. Every day you continue to get deceived, but you are not
aware, hence it does not hurt you and your dignity.</p><p><br></p><p>You see a woman as very beautiful – and she is certainly beautiful,
but where does that beauty go after the honeymoon? Then you want to kill
the same woman for whom you were ready to die one day.</p><p><br></p><p>You can appreciate other women’s beauty, but I have never heard of
any husband appreciating his own wife’s beauty. Perhaps what he saw was
not the real woman as she is; he saw the woman as he wanted to see
her.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a dream projection, and a dream projection cannot be prolonged
for long. Sooner or later the dream projection drops away, and suddenly
you see the real person. Nothing has changed: the woman is the same, the
man is the same, but neither the woman thinks you are the same man she
fell in love with, nor do you think she is the same woman you had fallen
in love with.</p><p><br></p><p>What happened? Just within a week... and if you are intelligent
enough, then just over the weekend. It depends on intelligence. The
idiots can live out their whole lives. The more intelligent a person is,
the sooner he will see his projections, imaginations dropping, the
clouds disappearing, and he will see the pure sky without any clouds –
and it is going to change his opinion.</p><p><br></p><p>Rinzai is saying that we are all living in shadow. You think, you
project, you imagine, you dream. The greatest lovers in the world were
those who never met; their love is eternal. People sing songs of Siri
and Farhad, of Laila and Majnu, of Soni and Mahival, and the only reason
why their love is remembered is that they were never allowed by their
parents and the society to be together.</p><p><br></p><p>If Laila and Majnu had got married, you would never have heard their
names. Have you ever heard any story, any poetry concerning a married
couple? I at least have searched enough, and I have not found it. It
seems to be intrinsically impossible, because as they come close, their
projections start falling. If they are kept away, forced to be apart,
then their dreams become even more beautiful. Their imagination takes
wings.</p><p><br></p><p>And not only in this matter but in other matters also, you live in
shadows, in your hopes. What have you got in your hopes? Just empty
imagination that tomorrow something will happen that has not happened up
to now, and you will feel fulfilled. It never happens. What happens
tomorrow is death, and death creates fear for a simple reason you may
not be aware of.</p><p>The fear of death is that it takes the future out of your hands. You
have been living in the future in your imagination, and death comes and
puts a full stop. No more tomorrow. The future is simply your idea of
how things should be. The existence has no obligation to you to fulfill
your desires and your hopes. People even give promises, people say to
each other, “I will love you my whole life,” not knowing at all that the
whole life is a long thing.</p><p><br></p><p>One man was saying to his girlfriend, “I will love you my whole
life.”</p><p><br></p><p>Then for a moment he became silent, and the woman said, “Why have you
become silent suddenly?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Just tell me one thing. In your old age, will you start
looking like your mother? – because then I cannot give that promise.
Suddenly I thought, ‘What am I saying? In the old age this woman is
going to look like the mother-in-law!’” And mother-in-laws... it is just
strange that people don’t shoot them.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard, a hunter was going into the forest for hunting. His
wife insisted on going and she also insisted on taking his
mother-in-law. Not to create any trouble he said, “Okay, there is no
harm in it. You can sit in the top of a tree and you can see.”</p><p><br></p><p>The mother-in-law was not too old to climb a tree, so she was sitting
in a small tree when a lion came near. The wife saw it from her tall
tree and shouted to her husband, “Just see, one lion is very close to my
mother.”</p><p><br></p><p>The husband said, “It is not my problem, it is the lion’s problem.
Now he has got into trouble. If he wants to get out, he will get out.
You just keep quiet.”</p><p><br></p><p>People expect something, and it is never fulfilled. There is always
frustration all around. People are living in despair, and the reason is
that what they expected... existence has no desire, no reason to go
according to their expectations. If you want to be happy, go along with
existence and its ends wherever it takes you.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what I mean by let-go: you simply drop your projections, your
imaginations, and let the existence take hold of your whole life. Then
there is no despair, because there is no possibility of being
frustrated. There is no anguish and no anxiety; you are relaxed with
existence. Whatever happens, that is good.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole existence is wiser than you, so whatever happens – Buddha
says suchness – just whatever happens, remember, such is the nature of
existence. Don’t stand aloof and against existence; be part, and feel a
certain oneness.</p><p><br></p><p>That oneness can be called suchness, or isness, or thisness, but the
meaning is that whatever happens is good. You have to find out the
beauty of it and the joy of it. Only such a man can be blissful;
otherwise there is always the feeling of being deceived.</p><p><br></p><p>Every man – out of a thousand, perhaps one man dies without the idea
that he has been deceived by life. Almost everybody dies with the idea,
“What was it? Seventy years I struggled; what is the game?” All your
expectations are shattered, all your dreams are broken, all your
promises remain unfulfilled. You are dying a bankrupt.</p><p>Almost everybody dies a bankrupt as far as his expectations are
concerned. Only a man of let-go is not deceived by anything. He takes
everything that comes in the way happily and joyously, and if things
change, he allows the change without any hindrance, without creating any
barriers to prevent the change. Such a man knows no deceptions. He knows
life has never deceived him, but has always fulfilled those longings
which he was not even aware of.</p><p><br></p><p>HORIN THEN SAID: “SEEING THERE IS WIND, WAVES ARISE; PLAYING WITH THE
WATER, THE ROUGH SAIL FLAPS.”</p><p><br></p><p>He did not understand that Rinzai was not talking about the fish, and
he is trying to explain his own statement without listening to what
Rinzai has raised as a question.</p><p><br></p><p>RINZAI SAID: “THE FROG IN THE MOON SHINES BRIGHTLY ALONE, AND ALL
RIVERS AND HILLS ARE AT PEACE. THE LONG BREATH OF THE WIND IS THE VOICE
OF AUTUMN IN EARTH AND SKY.”</p><p><br></p><p>Everything is as it should be. So peaceful are the hills in the full
moon night... rivers are at peace, dancing in the full moon night.
Because of their dance the full moon’s reflection becomes a silver
spread over all. Everything is silent and peaceful, there is no
frustration in the hills, there is no frustration in the rivers. Even
the frog in the moon shines brightly alone.</p><p><br></p><p>If you look at nature, just taking man and his mind away, everything
is bliss, everything is buddha. It is only man’s mind that creates
trouble, because it cannot allow a let-go.</p><p><br></p><p>THE LONG BREATH OF THE WIND IS THE VOICE OF AUTUMN IN EARTH AND
SKY.</p><p><br></p><p>And there is great joy that autumn is coming. The moon is full of
blissfulness and all that shines in the moonlight, except man...</p><p><br></p><p>Man can also be as happy as the hills and as peaceful as the rivers
if he looks at the moon and the surroundings without any mind. With no
thought, he will also become part of the whole scene.</p><p><br></p><p>But man remains always concerned with his own stupid ideas. When the
whole existence is rejoicing, it is only man who is worried. Have you
ever seen a tree worried? No animal is ever worried. Even in dying, it
dies peacefully. Such is the way of existence, that anything that is
born is going to die.</p><p><br></p><p>But man’s mind intrudes, always creates problems, because it expects
things to be different than they are. He is not ready to accept the
suchness of existence; he wants it according to him. This, according to
him, is the whole misery. Everybody is trying that everything should be
according to him. One may say it, one may not say it, but even without
saying it, your mind is weaving thoughts about how things should be
brought according to YOUR idea – and this is impossible.</p><p><br></p><p>You cannot change existence.</p><p><br></p><p>All that you can do is drop your mind.</p><p>HORIN SAID: “THOUGH YOU MAY SPREAD YOUR THREE INCHES OF TONGUE, AND
ILLUMINATE THE CELESTIAL QUIETNESS, JUST TRY AND SAY A SINGLE WORD TO
FIT THE OCCASION!”</p><p><br></p><p>RINZAI RESPONDED – and his response is of fundamental importance:
“WHEN YOU MEET A MASTER SWORDSMAN, SHOW HIM YOUR SWORD. WHEN YOU MEET A
MAN WHO IS NOT A POET, DO NOT SHOW HIM YOUR POEM.”</p><p><br></p><p>Each according to his worth, each according to his receptivity. You
are not yet able to receive one word and understand it. I cannot recite
a poem to you, because you will not understand it; you will certainly
misunderstand.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard, a thief was brought into the court, and the judge said,
“Why have you entered this man’s house?”</p><p><br></p><p>The poor thief said, “I have entered to steal something. But the man
was so strange: he caught hold of me, and when I tried hard to escape he
said, ‘Don’t be worried, just sit down and listen. I have written a new
poem.’ I thought it was better to listen silently, but the poem went on
and on and on. And he was holding me by the hand, so this way the whole
night he tortured me. I didn’t understand a single word of what he was
saying, and I could not escape either.</p><p><br></p><p>“By the morning the police came, and now I am standing here before
you with only one hope: that you will not give me the punishment to
listen to this poet again. I am ready even to go to the gallows. I had
no idea that this house belongs to a poet, otherwise I would not have
entered.”</p><p><br></p><p>Poets are like that. It is very difficult for them to find audiences.
They go on searching around to see if they can find somebody, and
everybody goes on running away saying, “I have to do some special work.
Right now I am not available.” Who wants to waste time?</p><p><br></p><p>“Unless you are a poet,” Rinzai is saying, “don’t say anything to a
person who is not worthy of it, because that is insulting him, that is
degrading him, that is taking his dignity, that is bringing up his
unworthiness. So don’t ask me for a single word; you are not yet capable
of receiving it. You have not understood a single thing, and you went on
explaining. You are not a fish and you don’t know what goes on in the
mind of the fish.</p><p><br></p><p>“Talk about man and talk about his deceptions, and find out the
reason why he gets deceived. It is his own resistance to existence, and
an effort to give a mold to the whole life – which is not possible. He
is trying the impossible and goes on failing.”</p><p><br></p><p>This failure is not just his mistake. It is not that he has not been
doing rightly; whatever he does he will be a failure. Nobody can be
wiser than the cosmic existence. So the wise people allow themselves to
go along with the existential river, not even asking, “Where are we
going?”</p><p><br></p><p>Existence is going nowhere. It is simply here, just playing with
thousands of forms, thousands of situations, creating more and more
consciousness, more and more happiness, more and more love. If it is not
happening to you, it simply means you are keeping your doors closed.</p><p>Just open your heart and relax with existence and suddenly you will
see, THE FROG IN THE MOON SHINES BRIGHTLY ALONE. No company is needed,
no richness is needed – just a poor frog. No political position is
needed – and all rivers and hills are at peace. They don’t have
anything, but they have peace, which you cannot purchase.</p><p><br></p><p>THE LONG BREATH OF THE WIND IS THE VOICE OF AUTUMN IN EARTH AND SKY.
Just be</p><p>with existence wherever it is going and you will be unworried. Your
tensions will disappear. You will be as happy as a child, you will be as
beautiful as a flower.</p><p><br></p><p>Ikkyu wrote:</p><p><br></p><p>WHEN YOU BREAK UP A CHERRY TREE AND LOOK,</p><p>THERE ARE NO FLOWERS AT ALL; THE FLOWERS ARE BROUGHT BY THE SPRING
WIND.</p><p>EVEN THOUGH YOU SOAR BOUNDLESSLY EVEN BEYOND THE CLOUDS,</p><p>JUST DON’T RELY ON</p><p><br></p><p>THE TEACHINGS OF GAUTAMA.</p><p><br></p><p>Two things Ikkyu is saying: one, you cannot bring the flowers, which
will come in their own time. You have to wait, you have to be patient.
You cannot ask, “Why are the cherry flowers not coming?” The tree is
there, you are watering the tree<span class=s4></span>You can even,
Ikkyu says, break up a cherry tree and look</p><p>inside the tree to find where the flowers are hidden. There are no
flowers at all.</p><p><br></p><p>The flowers are brought by the spring wind. Let the spring come, let
the right moment and the climate and the right wind reach the cherry
tree. It will blossom suddenly, it will explode into immense beauty.</p><p><br></p><p>The cherry tree is waiting; it is not in a hurry, it is not running
somewhere to catch up with spring. It is simply waiting silently,
joyously. Spring comes; even if it is a day or two late, what does it
matter? It has always been coming.</p><p><br></p><p>The second thing Ikkyu says: EVEN THOUGH YOU SOAR BOUNDLESSLY EVEN
BEYOND THE CLOUDS, JUST DON’T RELY ON THE TEACHINGS OF GAUTAMA. That can
be said only by the Zen masters about their own originator: “Don’t rely
on Gautama the Buddha’s teachings” – because his teachings were in a
different context. He was talking to a different kind of people. You may
not be that kind of person at all, and the times have changed; those
teachings may be no more relevant.</p><p>Only rely on your own consciousness. Even Gautama’s consciousness is
not reliable. He is not saying that Gautama is wrong; he is saying that
Gautama was dealing with situations fifteen hundred years before.</p><p><br></p><p>I have told you of an instance when just in a single day... In the
morning a man asked Gautam Buddha, “Is there a God?”</p><p><br></p><p>And Gautama said, “No, there is no God.”</p><p><br></p><p>In the afternoon another man asked, “What do you think about God?”
Gautama said, “Yes, God is.”</p><p>You can understand the trouble Ananda, who was continuously with him,
was in. He started having a migraine. What kind of man is this? In the
morning he says, “There is no God,” and in the afternoon he has
forgotten completely, and he is saying, “There is God.”</p><p><br></p><p>He waited for the time in the night when there would be nobody
around, but before that a third person came in the evening, sat down and
asked Gautama, “I have no conception either for or against God. Just
help me to understand.”</p><p><br></p><p>And Gautam Buddha did not say anything to the man, but on the
contrary simply closed his eyes, remained silent. Seeing this, the other
man also closed his eyes and sat. He thought perhaps Buddha was going to
say something in his silence and they both remained in silence for two
hours.</p><p><br></p><p>The man felt so beautiful and so fresh and so young, so rejuvenated,
that after two hours he opened his eyes and he was a changed man. He
touched Gautam Buddha’s feet, thanked him and told him, “I was not
expecting that much. You have given me more than I had asked. You have
given me a taste. I had come only to ask a question; you have taken me
to the experience itself. I will remain grateful to you my whole
life.”</p><p><br></p><p>In the night Ananda said, “You should at least think of me. The whole
day I have been in such a trouble. What kind of man are you? In the
morning you say no, in the afternoon you say yes, in the evening you
don’t say anything, but just remain silent – and that fellow gets the
answer and you have not said anything.”</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha said, “The first man, to whom I said, ‘There is no God,’ was
an atheist, and he had come to get a confirmation of his atheism, that
if Gautam Buddha also is an atheist, then there is no problem. Atheism
is certainly the right approach. There is no God.</p><p><br></p><p>“The second man had also come for confirmation of his own prejudice.
He was a theist and he wanted support. They were not seekers, they were
only asking for consolation. They had already got the idea; they were
simply asking me to support their ideas. They were satisfied with their
ideas without ever moving into any new space.</p><p><br></p><p>“But the third man was really a seeker. He plainly said, ‘I don’t
have any idea for or against.’ For such a man only silence is the
answer. And because he had no prejudice, seeing me closing my</p><p>eyes and becoming silent, he immediately understood the hint. He
closed his eyes and he went deep into silence. Although I had not said
anything to him, he went away immensely richer than he had come.</p><p><br></p><p>“And Ananda,” Buddha said, “you should not be disturbed, because none
of these questions were yours. It is not your problem.”</p><p><br></p><p>Ananda said, “It is not my problem, but I have ears and I am always
close to you.”</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha said, “You will have to learn that I don’t have any fixed
philosophy so that I can hand over immediately ready-made answers. I
have to see the person, his capacity. I don’t want to insult anybody. I
don’t want to give something which they cannot understand, which is
going to be over their heads.”</p><p><br></p><p>If this was the situation in Buddha’s own time, Ikkyu is right: JUST
DON’T RELY ON THE TEACHINGS OF GAUTAMA. Find out your own sources. Go
deeper into your own being. You will find there the affirmation of
Gautam Buddha.</p><p><br></p><p>But don’t rely on the teachings. Just don’t sit with the scriptures,
reading them for years, studying them for years. That is not going to
help. Gautam Buddha had not read those scriptures before he became
enlightened, so it is absolutely certain that they cannot be the cause
of anybody’s enlightenment. Just do what he did; don’t be too much
concerned what he said. Whatever he said was meant for his
contemporaries, for his time, for the people he was talking to.</p><p><br></p><p>Do what Buddha did. He became a no-mind, and becoming a no-mind, you
will have to throw even Buddha and his scriptures out of your being.
Only in this emptiness is there a possibility of the cherry blossoms of
your being coming from the potential to the actual. You can bring the
spring by bringing the no-mind.</p><p><br></p><p>As no-mind comes, thousands of miracles follow. But don’t desire
those miracles; if you start desiring them, you will never have the
no-mind, because those desires will not allow the mind to be empty.</p><p><br></p><p>So remember, it is one of the most significant things for a seeker
that he should not become too much concerned about the search. He should
remain playful. “If there is a truth in existence, some day, somewhere I
am going to encounter it.”</p><p><br></p><p>But don’t be serious, just be playful. In playfulness you are
relaxed, and in relaxation, utter relaxation, you will find Gautam
Buddha himself, so why bother about his teachings? When you can find
Gautam Buddha himself, then why bother about dead scriptures? Ikkyu is
right, absolutely right.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 1</p><p><br></p><p>Maneesha has asked a question:</p><p><br></p><p>OUR BELOVED MASTER,</p><p><br></p><p>IS THE WITNESS A PRESENCE OR SIMPLY AN ABSENCE – THE ABSENCE OF
IDENTIFICATION WITH BODY AND MIND?</p><p>Maneesha, it is a difficult question – difficult only because your
mind never accepts contradictions, and existence absolutely is in favor
of contradictions. In fact, existence is made of contradictions. So
these two words, presence and absence, are both right.</p><p><br></p><p>In the witness there is absence, certainly, of your personality, of
your mind, of your thoughts, feelings – anything that you are carrying
within your mind is absent. If you look from this side, it appears that
no-mind is empty mind.</p><p><br></p><p>But the moment all these things are emptied out, the potential of
your being starts growing – a new presence which was hindered from
growing by all the furniture that you have been carrying in the mind.
Now that all that furniture and all those stones are thrown and the soil
is ready, there comes a new presence.</p><p><br></p><p>So both are there as far as your mind is concerned. Meditation is an
effort of creating absence. But when the mind is really absent, in that
silence, in that unlimited space, your potential starts glowing,
radiating, flowering. Suddenly you are full of cherry blossoms, a new
presence, a new fragrance.</p><p><br></p><p>So absence and presence are both together in your meditation. On the
one hand you are emptying, on the other hand the empty space is being
filled with your potential. Before there was no space for it to
blossom.</p><p><br></p><p>Meditation is simply creating a space for your potential to come to
flower. A man of meditation has such a presence that you can feel
it.</p><p><br></p><p>In my dining room I have got a small statue of Buddha. It is only a
statue, but when Jayesh came for the first time and saw it, he said,
“This statue has a great presence.” I have loved that statue and carried
it from India to America, from America to India, because it has a
presence. It is only a statue, but a statue of a meditating buddha.
Something of meditation in that very posture radiates a very alive
aura.</p><p><br></p><p>I have brought another statue for your Buddha Auditorium, to be
placed just at the gate, so you can see that even a statue, because it
is in a meditative posture, radiates something. Just sitting by the side
of the statue you will find something flowing from the statue towards
you. It is not a worship, it is just being silently close and watching
the posture. Because the posture is of meditation, something of
meditativeness radiates even from the stone.</p><p><br></p><p>So when you are meditating, you are doing both the things: on one
hand you are throwing away all that is garbage, and on the other hand
you are helping roses to blossom. You will have an absence and you will
have a great presence, together: absence of all that was ugly in you,
and presence of all that is beautiful.</p><p><br></p><p>It is time for Sardar Gurudayal Singh. I hope he is still in his
rainbow-colored turban. That turban has a special presence!</p><p><br></p><p>It is the farewell party at the White House for Ronald and Nancy
Reagan. Everybody gets pretty drunk and Nancy Reagan offers to give
George Bush, the president-elect, a private tour of the presidential
bedroom.</p><p>When they get back to the party, George Bush looks for Ronald Reagan
and finds him slumped on a couch, fast asleep.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hey, Ronald,” says Bush, shaking Reagan roughly. “Do you have any
pictures of Nancy in the nude?”</p><p><br></p><p>“What?” mumbles Reagan, in shock. “You idiot! Of course I don’t!”
“Okay,” says Bush, holding up his camera. “Wanna buy some?”</p><p>Doris and Jeff Dull have been married for six years and have three
kids. But Jeff has a strange habit – he will only make love with the
lights off.</p><p><br></p><p>Doris puts up with this for as long as she can, but one night her
curiosity gets the better of her. She and Jeff are making love in the
usual way when suddenly she snaps the light on, and to her horror, she
sees that Jeff is making love to her using a cucumber.</p><p><br></p><p>“You impotent wimp!” shouts Doris. “So this is why you never wanted
the lights on! It’s disgusting – explain yourself!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay, dear,” says Jeff, calmly. “I can explain the cucumber, if you
can explain our three kids!”</p><p><br></p><p>Adolf Hitler pushes the doorbell at the Pearly Gates of Heaven and
demands to be admitted. He kicks up such a fuss that Saint Peter calls
Jesus to come and deal with the situation.</p><p><br></p><p>“I want to come in,” cries the Fuhrer, “and I will reward you highly
if you let me stay.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What do you mean?” asks Jesus. “You cannot possibly come in. Just
look at what you did on earth!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Look,” says Hitler, taking Jesus to one side, “if you let me in, I
will personally present you with Germany’s highest award for bravery,
the Iron Cross.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Really?” says Jesus. “That’s a very tempting offer. Just let me make
one phone call.”</p><p><br></p><p>So Jesus calls up God the Father. “Dad,” says Jesus, “I’ve got Adolf
Hitler here at the Pearly Gates, and he wants to come in. What do you
think?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Jesus Christ!” shouts God. “Are you kidding? The guy is a
psychopath!”</p><p><br></p><p>“I know, Dad,” says Jesus, “but you see, he has made me this terrific
offer. He wants to give me the Iron Cross!”</p><p><br></p><p>“The Iron Cross?” shouts God, in amazement. “You idiot! Look what
happened when you got that wooden one!”</p><p>Nivedano... (Drumbeat)</p><p>(Gibberish) Nivedano... (Drumbeat)</p><p>Be silent. Close your eyes. Feel your body to be completely
frozen.</p><p><br></p><p>Now look inwards with your total life energy, with your total
consciousness, and with an urgency as if this is going to be the last
moment of your life.</p><p><br></p><p>Only with urgency can you reach to the center of your being, and at
the center of your being you are the buddha. To realize this is to
create the right space for all kinds of transformations in your life.
Let this experience sink into every fiber of your being.</p><p><br></p><p>The buddha has only one quality, and that quality is witnessing. The
buddha is made of witnessing, of watching. Just watch, and in your very
watching your buddhahood deepens.</p><p><br></p><p>This evening, this moment you are the most fortunate ones on the
earth, because to be a buddha is to be a Himalayan Everest of
consciousness. Then you don’t have to follow any discipline, any
morality. All that is good comes behind you like a shadow.</p><p><br></p><p>Just remain a witness around the clock. Whatever you are doing, do it
with full awareness and with a grace that shows that you have recognized
the buddha in the deepest core of your being.</p><p><br></p><p>To make it more clear, Nivedano... (Drumbeat)</p><p>Just watch, be a witness.</p><p><br></p><p>You are not the body, you are not the mind; you are simply the
witnessing, and this witnessing is the buddha.</p><p><br></p><p>The spring has come and the cherry tree has blossomed into thousands
of flowers. Collect as many flowers and as much of witnessing...</p><p><br></p><p>Persuade the buddha to come from the hidden secrets of your life into
the circumference, into your day-to-day life. He always has come, just
the right persuasion is needed, and showing him your worthiness by
witnessing.</p><p><br></p><p>Collect as much of this relaxed moment, of this let-go, before
Nivedano calls you back.</p><p><br></p><p>This moment the Buddha Auditorium is no more the gathering of ten
thousand buddhas. It has become a lake of tremendous consciousness
without any ripples. You are the fish in the ocean. Don’t ask where the
ocean is.</p><p>Nivedano... (Drumbeat)</p><p>Come back, and bring your buddha with you. Silently and gracefully,
sit for a few moments just to remember where you have been, what golden
path you have followed, what your center is like.</p><p><br></p><p>The silence, the beauty, the blissfulness – you have to spread it on
your circumference in every action, in every gesture, in every word, in
every silence. You should remain a buddha in spite of any situation.</p><p><br></p><p>Being with me, you have got an opportunity which is no more available
anywhere on the earth. It used to be available in many, many places.
Those golden days have passed.</p><p><br></p><p>My effort is to give you a glimpse of those golden days when
thousands of people in different places were trying to reach to the
ultimate consciousness, to immortality, to eternity.</p><p><br></p><p>Without reaching to your center you are a cherry tree which will
never find its spring. The moment you reach to your center you allow the
spring to come to you. Your whole life becomes a dance, a poetry, a
song.</p><p><br></p><p>Okay, Maneesha? Yes, Beloved Master.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part5>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

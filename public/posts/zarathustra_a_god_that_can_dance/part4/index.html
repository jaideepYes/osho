But his love and his compassion is such that he does not ask them to be worthy to understand him.\nI am reminded of Bodhidharma, a man of the same height of consciousness as Zarathustra. He remained sitting before a wall, facing the wall, keeping his back towards the audience for nine years. People would come, but he would talk to the wall; people would ask questions, but he would answer to the wall.\nThe emperor of China, Wu, was very much puzzled with this strange man. He asked him, “Why do you face the wall? this is absolutely unheard of. You are talking to the people; you should face them.” Bodhidharma had tears in his eyes, and still facing the wall he said, “I have talked for many years to many people, facing them, but I have always found I am talking to the wall. They hear, but they don’t listen. They appear to understand, but they only misunderstand.”\nAnd particularly a man like Zarathustra or Bodhidharma is bound to be misunderstood, because they are absolutely non-compromising with your lies, with your beliefs. Their truth is going to shatter you completely. To protect yourself, either you don’t hear what they are saying or you interpret it in such a way that it does not disturb you. You will be extremely surprised that modern research has found that almost ninety-eight percent is being censored out – only two percent reaches to you.\nZarathustra is saying tremendously significant statements which can become the foundation of a new humanity, but he has to be understood with great sympathy. He has to be heard not only by your mind, but by your being too. Unless every cell of your body is thrilled by what he is saying, you will not understand him.\nDo not depend only on the mind: mind – rather than understanding – always creates misunderstanding, because mind has already its own prejudices. It clings to its prejudices. It allows in only those things which support its prejudices; otherwise it does not allow them in. Or even if by chance they have entered in, it interprets them, dilutes them, destroys their fire, takes their living quality. They become just hypotheses, they lose their reality, they cannot transform you.\nOnly a truth that reaches to your heart alive, dancing, is capable of taking you beyond your present state of consciousness. In these statements there are thousands of gems spread all over, but one needs to be a jeweler to understand them.\nAn old fable of Aesop is: A farmer is returning home with his donkey, and finds by the side of the road, perhaps the biggest diamond in existence, but the poor fellow has no idea that it is a diamond. He has heard the word, but he has never seen one. Still it is shining so beautifully in the sunrays, that he thinks, it is a beautiful stone and I have never given anything to my poor donkey. He will enjoy it very much. So he ties the stone around the neck of the donkey.\nAs they move on, a jeweler approaching on his horse is so shocked: he has never seen such a great diamond, and that too tied on a donkey’s neck. He stops his horse and asks the owner of the donkey, “How much will you take for it?” The farmer said, “It is a stone; perhaps one rupee will be enough.”\nBut greed is such, that the jeweler, knowing it is worth millions of rupees, says, “You are asking too much just for a stone. I will give you eight annas, half a rupee.” The farmer thought for a moment, and then he said, “Then let my donkey enjoy it. I am not selling it.”\nAs chance will have it, by great coincidence, another jeweler comes by in his chariot, and almost has a heart attack when he seesHe asked the owner, “How much is the price?” Now the owner\nstarted becoming a little alert: The stone seems to be precious. He said, “Two rupees will do.” Just the poor man’s imagination; two rupees are too much.\nThe first jeweler has gone slowly, just a little bit, hoping that the farmer will think that eight annas, half a rupee, just for a stone is too much. He will agree, he just needs a little time.\nBut when he saw a chariot standing there, he rushed to the place and he asked the farmer, “Remember I was the first to enquire the price of the stone? I am ready to give you one rupee.” The other jeweler said, “I am ready to give him two rupees.” And there was a contest; the owner was simply listening. They were talking numbers that he could not understand.\nFinally the farmer said, “Don’t unnecessarily waste your time; I have decided not to sell it. I don’t understand your numbers, but one thing is certain: I have to go to the marketplace and seek a few more opinions about the stone. The stone is not an ordinary stone, that much is certain, and I am very grateful to both of you.”\nThe first man said, “But you are foolish. We are ready to give lakhs of rupees.” The farmer laughed, and said to his donkey, “Have you listened? Who is foolish? I was selling it at one rupee, and I was not aware that it is something so precious. Then he said to the jeweler,”I am a poor man, you are a jeweler, you know exactly how much is the value, and still you did not agree to give me just one rupee. Who is foolish? I was ignorant of the fact that it has any value, but you were perfectly aware, and still you wanted to save half a rupee.”\nThey both tried. They said, “We will not conflict. We will purchase it together.” He said, “Now it is too late. I have become aware so I am going to the market, and I will ask all the jewelers. First, I will have to find out how much this stone is worth, and then I will think whether I want to sell it or let my donkey enjoy it.”\nPeople like Zarathustra, in each of their words, are giving you gems of immense value. But it depends on your understanding, intelligence, alertness; otherwise you will hear them just like\nanybody else talking. Remember the same words have different values when they come from different mouths. When an ignorant man speaks, he may be using the same words, but they are empty: They don’t have any value. When a man like Zarathustra speaks, the same words immediately become so valuable, because the man behind the word is the meaning of the word. His experience is the content of the word.\nWHAT IS THE GREATEST THING YOU CAN EXPERIENCE? It is almost impossible to imagine Zarathustra’s answer. He says, IT IS THE HOUR OF THE GREAT CONTEMPT – the contempt for your ignorance, the contempt for your hate, the contempt for your jealousy, the contempt for your mundane life, the contempt for all the animal instincts within you. In short, the contempt for yourself is the greatest experience you can experience. And only those who have gone beyond humanity are the people who have contempt for everything that man consists of.\nIt is all rotten: your beliefs are rotten; your ideologies are dead; your religions are nothing but imprisonments; your philosophies are just castles in the air.\nWhat do you have? Your life has not produced, has not been creative of something that can make the universe more beautiful, more valuable. You are just a burden on the earth, unnecessarily occupying space, unnecessarily stopping somebody else who may have been a creator, who may have been a Zarathustra.\nIt hurts for the first time when you hear it: that the greatest thing you can experience is the hour of the great contempt, the hour in which even your happiness grows loathsome to you. What is your happiness?... so mundane, so ordinary, so repetitive: there is nothing great in it. But nobody thinks about what his happiness consists of. Somebody’s happiness is good food, somebody’s happiness is sexuality, somebody’s happiness is accumulation of money, somebody’s happiness is fame, somebody’s happiness is power.\nJayesh was telling me the other day that one of his friends was writing a book on Indira Gandhi, and remained for many months to watch her life, to ask her questions. One day when they were both alone, he asked a simple question, and he was shocked when he heard the answer; you will also be shocked.\nHis question was, “We have been discussing great problems – philosophical, political, social, religious, educational – and today I want you to answer me a simple thing. What is your hobby in life?”\nThat moment in Indira Gandhi’s life must have been of tremendous honesty and sincerity. One cannot expect politicians to be sincere, but there are moments. One becomes tired of insincerity, tired of dishonesty, tired of hypocrisy. She was alone and forgot that she was a politician, and answered, “My only hobby is power.” But then she must have recognized immediately what she had said. She implored the man, “This is off record, it is just a personal chit-chat: You cannot put it in the book you are writing.” The politician is back.\nSomebody’s happiness is power: power over people, domination, destruction. What are the constituents of your happiness? If you watch intelligently, you will be full of contempt. And your reason.… Everybody thinks that he is a very rational being. But have you ever thought that you\nhave so many superstitions which are a solid evidence of the absence of reason, not the presence of reason.\nA man of reason cannot have a belief in God. Do you believe in God? A man of reason cannot believe in heaven and hell. Do you believe? A man of reason cannot be a Christian, or a Hindu, or a Mohammedan, or a Buddhist, because these are different kinds of superstitions. Their differences are not based on any valid evidence. Their differences are so stupid that if you have reason, you will not be able to believe that millions of people are living with these superstitions, believing that they are rational.\nIn my university, there was a department for yoga, because the vice-chancellor was very much interested in yoga. He thought that he is being very rational, far ahead of his time, because he was the first to introduce yoga as a department in his university. No other university in the whole world had a yoga department. He bragged about it.\nOne day I could not resist the temptation and I said, “Enough is enough. I have heard you bragging about this yoga department and you think you have done a great rational service to humanity. Now I want rational proofs. All kinds of distortions of the body, how they are going to help man’s spiritual growth? What relationship is there? And if spiritual growth happens through these distortions, then the head of the department of yoga, who knows all yoga exercises to perfection, he should be a giant like a Gautam Buddha, or a Mahavira.\n“But he is a stupid man. He is a proof that all those distortions of the body do not help spiritual growth; perhaps they destroy spiritual growth.” And I have reasons to believe that they destroy. Standing on your head for hours is going to destroy your very fragile brain cells, because so much blood will be coming to the mind, like a flood. And your small head has millions of cells, so tiny and so fragile.\nAnimals have not been able to develop intelligence, for the simple reason their head and their body is in the same horizontal line. Too much blood runs through their head and does not allow the delicate framework of a brain to develop. Because man is standing on his feet, blood has to go against gravitation towards the head, so a very small amount reaches. That is enough for the nourishment of those cells. It is not a flood, it is just the right proportion.\nI asked him, “Do you use a pillow when you sleep, or not?”\nHe said, “I use a pillow, but what does that have to do with yoga?”\nI said, “It does have something to do with it. It keeps your head intact from the flood that will come if it was horizontal with the body. You cannot sleep without a pillow, for the simple reason that the flood is so much it keeps you awake. Your mind cannot be at rest.”\nI said, “You stop bragging about it; otherwise I will start speaking against it in the university. And I know the man you think is a spiritual teacher who heads the department.”\nBy chance I had come to know him. I was going to New Delhi in a train and at a midway junction the compartment was disconnected from the first train, and was connected to another train that went to\nNew Delhi. We both were travelling. I was in the compartment and he was to catch the compartment at the junction. I had got off, because the train was going to be there for one hour, so I could take my bath, my breakfast and a little walk.\nWhen I came back to my compartment, what did I see? He had removed my bed, had spread his own bed, and was pretending to be fast asleep. The train was crowded, and there was not even a space to sit. But because I was coming from the original place from where the train starts.…\nI said, “This is great.” I shook him, but he would not open his eyes. I said to him, “Remember, it is only difficult to wake up a man if he is awake. If he is asleep, it is not a difficult problem. And soon you will repent.”\nI took all his luggage out of the compartment on to the platform. Still he managed... thinking that I cannot be so unkind to him. We were professors in the same university. But I told him, “You have been ungraceful. You should have asked my permission before you removed my bed. I will see how long you can sleep, because now there are only ten minutes more, and the train will leave, and all your luggage is on the platform.”\nNow he became fidgety, and as he heard the first whistle, he jumped up. I said, “What happened to your great sleep? I was thinking you are in samadhi!”\nHe said, “This is very mischievous of you.”\nI said, “You started the game, and I believe in tit for tat.”\nBut he would not get out. He called a porter from the window, and asked him to bring the luggage in. But I told the porter that “I will pay you double. Just keep that luggage on the platform.”\nThe porter said, “Of course, whoever pays me more.” And finally the third whistle, and the train started moving and the yogi jumped out to take his luggage. Meanwhile, I folded his bed and threw it on the ground and I was fast asleep. He was very angry, and although I was fast asleep he started saying to me, “This is not good.”\nI said, “Listen, I am fast asleep. You are not supposed to talk to a fast-asleep man. You have learnt your lesson!”\nI told the vice-chancellor, “This stupid man you think is a saint, has some spirituality: he is not even intelligent.\n“Because by a very strange coincidence, the train.In India everything is possible – only on the\nplatform will the lights come on, and as the train leaves the platform, the lights will disappear, the electricity will be gone. The yoga teacher was sitting on his luggage, because there was no other place. Once I hit on his head in the darkness, and he said, “Who is hitting me?” And when the lights came on, he enquired again.\nI said, “Why should anybody hit you, unless you have done something wrong.” He said, “I have been sitting on my suitcases.”\nI said, “We will see, it is still a long journey and the whole night is ahead.”\nA woman was sitting on the upper berth. When the light went off again, I started pulling her saree. So she started screaming, “Somebody is pulling my saree.”\nI said, “It is nobody. It is this man who is sitting in front of you.” And I put the saree in his hands, and he was such an idiot, that he took it.\nHe said, “What is it?” Then the station came, and the whole compartment was against him: “Throw this man out. He is pretending to be a saint, and pulls the saree of a poor woman who is sitting here.”\nI said, “Now you know that you must be doing something wrong; that’s why somebody was hitting you.”\nHe went to the bathroom, and I told the two people who were sitting on both sides of him, “This man has to be thrown out some way, because this is absolutely against Indian culture. In the West it is okay, but in India a monk who pretends to be a celibate and is pulling the saree of a woman cannot be tolerated.” So they said, “What should be done?”\nI said, “You do one thing: when he sits down you press him from both sides.” They said, “That’s a good idea.”\nIn the darkness the yogi started shouting, “Two people are pushing me from both sides.” And at that very moment I hit him again, and he said, “Just forgive me, I will change compartments.”\nAs the light came on again at another station, he asked the people who were sitting by his side, “Why were you pushing me?” They said, “Strange, you seem to be a man of imagination. Why should we push you?” And he said, “Somebody hit me again on the head.”\nI said, “It is your yoga that has led you into hallucinations.”\nHe said, “I want to go out of this compartment. I want to change compartments.” I said, “You cannot.”\nHe said, “Why?”\nI said, “The whole compartment is agreed on the point that you should be punished the whole night. You can go out, but your luggage we will not allow you to take out.”\nAnd of course he could not leave his luggage, so the whole night all kinds of things were done to him, and in the morning I told him, getting out at New Delhi station, “You created the game. If you had not pretended... if you had told me that you are tired and you want rest, I would have moved my bed – but you threw it down. And I don’t believe that if you do something wrong in this life, you will be punished in another life. I believe: cash payment! You have been punished enough. Never do such a thing again.”\nHe said, “I will never do it again. Just do me one favor: don’t talk about it back in the university.”\nI said, “That I cannot do. I never give any promises. And this whole night has been so juicy, that I am really in a hurry to go back to the university and tell the vice-chancellor and tell all those idiots who are learning yoga exercises from you.”\nNot a single yogi in the centuries past has created anything, has discovered anything, has shown any genius.\nJust look at what your reason is, and you will feel a contempt for your reason. It is full of blind beliefs, unproved hypotheses, unexperienced faith. Without any proof, without any argument, you are carrying your religion, your philosophy; and you call it reason? It is a thing you should have great contempt for. And for your virtue also.\nWhat is your virtue? Almost everybody thinks he is virtuous. Because you have given some alms to a beggar, you are virtuous? Have you ever thought, in the first place why beggars exist? You exploit and create beggars, and then you give just a small portion – and you become a great virtuous man.\nWhat is your virtue? You don’t have anything to give really; you don’t have love, you don’t have joy, you don’t have any blissfulness: what can you give? All that you have is money, and money is soaked with the blood of those same people. It is a strange game: first make them beggars – then give them alms; and you are virtuous. Give something to an orphanage, and you are virtuous. And most probably that orphanage is having your children, produced by prostitutes. You produce those orphans. You talk against prostitution – if you ask people you will not find a single person who is in favor of prostitution – then why do prostitutes exist? Who goes there?\nPoor people cannot go – they don’t have the money. It is the rich people, the middle class people who can afford to go. The middle class people have to go to the prostitutes. The rich class people don’t go there. They have created a new class of prostitutes:call-girls. You just dial their number, and they will be available at your place. And all these people are against prostitutes.\nYour priests have been found, all over the world, exploiting sexually, and abusing sexually, small children. Many of them have been jailed. And it does not mean that those who have not been caught are not doing something of the same kind. Most of your monks, saddhus, nuns, sadhvis – are either homosexuals or lesbians, and they are talking against sex, talking about celibacy, but it is only talk.\nWhat is your virtue? You will feel a great contempt for it. It is hypocrisy. It is not virtue. Zarathustra is very strong.\nWHAT IS THE GREATEST THING YOU CAN EXPERIENCE? IT IS THE HOUR OF THE GREAT CONTEMPT. THE HOUR IN WHICH EVEN YOUR HAPPINESS GROWS LOATHSOME TO YOU, AND YOUR REASON AND YOUR VIRTUE ALSO.\nTHE HOUR WHEN YOU SAY: ‘WHAT GOOD IS MY HAPPINESS?’ IT IS POVERTY AND DIRT\nAND A MISERABLE EASE. Just look closely, what is your happiness? What are the situations which make you happy? And you will feel a great contempt for them.\nBUT MY HAPPINESS SHOULD JUSTIFY EXISTENCE ITSELF! Zarathustra says, “My happiness is not of miserable ease, of dirt, of poverty. My happiness springs from my own being. It justifies existence.” Your happiness does not arise from yourself. Your name comes up in a lottery and you are happy. What does it prove? Only your poverty. Only a poor man can be happy because a lottery came up in his name.\nAnything that comes from outside and makes you happy makes you also a slave, makes you also dependent. What kind of happiness is it that destroys your freedom, that destroys you?\nLeo Tolstoy has a beautiful story: A poor tailor used to purchase a ticket every month for the lottery. He had been doing it for twenty years but the lottie never came up in his name. His family, his friends got tired, and told him, “Why do you waste money? You are so poor, but the ticket has to be purchased. It has become almost a religious ritual.”\nBut one day the miracle happened. A black limousine came to the poor tailor’s shop and a man came out with a big bag – the tailor had won the lottery! He could not believe it, but he had to believe it when the money was delivered to him.\nHe was so happy. He locked the door of his shop and threw the key in a well, because now what is the point. He has so much money, he can live his whole life comfortably, enjoying all that is available in the world. But he was not aware that money goes very fast – in prostitutes, in alcohol, in gambling. All kinds of things that he had never imagined, he went through. He lost his health and within two years all the money was gone.\nHe came back to his shop. People said, “What happened? You look so old!” He said, “That goddamned lottery that destroyed my health, that took me to places where I should never have been. But what can you do with money? It is a constant temptation. All is lost; Please help me to find my key.” Some young man went into the well, searched for his key; the key was found, he opened his shop, started his work.\nBut just out of old habit, he still continued to purchase one ticket every month. Now people said, “Why are you doing it? It has not been a blessing to you, it has been a curse.” He said, “I know, and I know that it is not going to happen again; and I don’t want it to happen again.” They said, “This is strange, then why do you go on purchasing the ticket?” He said, “If I don’t purchase the ticket, the whole month I feel something is missing. It has become my lifelong habit. I am addicted, so don’t prevent me from purchasing the ticket. You know, for twenty years nothing happened, and I cannot think I have twenty more years to live. Those two years have destroyed me completely.”\nBut when miracles happen, they happen in a chain. Next year, again the black limousine came, and he said, “My God! Now I am finished.” The people said, “You need not do all those things.” He again locked the door, threw the key into the well and he said, “Now there will be no need to take it out, because I don’t think I can survive. The first lottery almost finished me – seventy-five percent, and this one will finish the remaining twenty-five percent.”\nSuch is the unconsciousness of man. Again the same round of prostitutes, of drinking alcohol, of gambling.What is your happiness? Is it a blessing?\nJust a few days ago, I was informed that in America almost one million people suffer from a headache when they make love, and for the next two days the migraine remains. But the strangest thing is they go on doing the same thing again and again, knowing perfectly well that migraine will come, and for two days they will have to suffer. They don’t enjoy sex, they cannot; it is a curse to them, but the stupidity, the insanity, the unawareness, leads them. After two, three days, when the migraine is gone, they start feeling again an urge – they have forgotten. Perhaps they have started hoping that it may not happen again. Their whole life is a proof that it has been happening again and again.\nWhat is your happiness? Unless your happiness comes from within you, just as flowers come from the inner juices of the treeIf your happiness is a flower of your being, it justifies existence. All\nyour so-called happiness of power, and money, and prestige is just a migraine.\nTHE HOUR WHEN YOU SAY: ’WHAT GOOD IS MY REASON? DOES IT LONG FOR KNOWLEDGE AS THE LION FOR ITS FOOD?\nIT IS POVERTY AND DIRT AND A MISERABLE EASE!’ An authentic, reasoning man is always in search of truth. Reason is the hunger for truth. Is your reason a hunger for truth? Is your reason a thirst for truth? Are you ready to sacrifice everything to find the truth? Just as the lion goes in search of food, reason goes in search of truth, in search of wisdom. Any other reason is nothing but dirt, poverty, and a miserable ease.\nTHE HOUR WHEN YOU SAY: ‘WHAT GOOD IS MY VIRTUE? IT HAS NOT YET DRIVEN ME MAD!’\nA virtuous man cannot compromise with the lies of the society. A virtuous man will destroy the causes, not the symptoms. He will not be satisfied and comfortable by giving donations to a few institutions.\nAnando was seeing a chartered accountant in Bombay who has a charitable trust – tax exempt. The trust is for providing food for stray dogs, so he goes in his car, with food for the dogs. Those stray dogs are in the poor sections of Bombay, where hungry boys and girls are standing – and he is feeding the dogs! He is thought to be a very virtuous, a very charitable man. What kind of virtue is this? And he feels great pride that he is the only one who takes care of the stray dogs.\nHumanity is going to die. Half of this country is going to starve to death by the end of this century; but he is immensely happy that he is taking care of stray dogs. The poor boys are standing there with their big bellies and thin limbs, hungry, hoping that somebody will give something to them. But his virtue, his charity, does not include them. He has found a good way to feel himself a pious man, a religious man.\nThe same man is ready to take any kind of bribe. In fact, all that virtue is a very minimum part of all the bribes that he accumulates. Taking bribes is not a problem: because, he is making absolute arrangements in the otherworld by feeding the dogs.\nIs your virtue just a cover-up of all your sins, of all your unvirtuous acts, of all your inhuman behavior to human beings?\nTHE HOUR WHEN YOU SAY: ‘WHAT GOOD IS MY PITY? IS NOT PITY THE CROSS UPON WHICH HE WHO LOVES MAN IS NAILED? BUT MY PITY IS NO CRUCIFIXION!’\nJesus Christ is crucified, but none of his popes, in two thousand years, has been crucified, and they are his representatives. Yes, they have a golden cross hanging around their neck on a golden chain. What a great capacity to deceive yourself! Your neck has to be on the cross, not the cross hanging on your neck; and that too of gold.\nJesus was only thirty-three years old, a young man and a carpenter’s son, accustomed to carrying big logs and wood from the forest to his father’s shop. He was given such a big and heavy cross that he fell three times before he reached to the destination. It was not made of gold. There were soldiers around him, lashing him when he fell: “Get up! Take the cross on your shoulders, and move.”\nIf your compassion, your pity, is just a comfortable idea, you should feel contempt for it.\nThe pope runs a bank; Jesus was a beggar. The pope’s bank has been found guilty of changing black money into white – millions of dollars – that is its whole business, and those millions of black dollars, changed into white money, are coming from the sale of heroin and other drugs. The pope goes on giving sermons against drugs, and the whole Vatican is supported by the money that comes from the drug sales.\nThe Italian government has issued an arrest warrant for the director of the pope’s bank. But they cannot enter the Vatican, because that eight square mile area is considered to be an independent country. It is in the middle of Rome. The man who was the head of the bank was only a bishop. Rather than handing him over to the police he has been promoted. Now he has become an archbishop; and the pope is hiding him. The Italian police cannot enter into the Vatican, and the business continues.\nThe pope goes on preaching around the world that religious people should not take part in politics, and he sent one hundred million dollars to a party in Poland to fight against the communists. If that is not taking part in politics, then what is taking part in politics? Man is such a deceiver; not only deceiving others, he deceives himself.\nZarathustra is right: if you look into those qualities for which you feel proud, you will feel contempt, and that is the greatest thing that can happen to a man, because only after that contempt will you make some effort to go beyond man, towards the superman.\nHAVE YOU EVER SPOKEN THUS? HAVE YOU EVER CRIED THUS? AH, THAT I HAD HEARD\nYOU CRYING THUS! Deep down, however clever and cunning you may be, you ARE aware that your virtue is false, your religion is a formality, your morality is a social mannerism, your honesty is just a facade.\nIT IS NOT YOUR SIN, – and this is a great statement – IT IS NOT YOUR SIN, BUT YOUR MODERATION THAT CRIES TO HEAVEN, YOUR VERY MEANNESS IN SINNING CRIES TO\nHEAVEN! He is saying that the superman will be total in every one of his acts. Totality will be his joy and his reward. What you call sin is not the problem, but your moderation. You sin, but halfheartedly. You cannot even sin with your totality. You cannot even be sincere in your sin.\nZarathustra is against what you have heard Confucius teaching: the golden mean. Confucius is more a social and political thinker: Never go to the extreme, always remain in the middle. But\nremaining in the middle, you will never be able to live anything in its totality. The insight of Zarathustra is: if you can live your life of sin in totality it will disappear. It is your moderation that causes it to go on lingering your whole life. It is your hypocrisy that does not allow it to be experienced, because the experience itself will be such you will not repeat it. But because you are halfhearted, the incomplete experience goes on urging you to complete it. Every incomplete experience has the tendency for completion.\nIT IS NOT YOUR SIN, BUT YOUR MODERATION THAT CRIES TO HEAVEN, YOUR VERY MEANNESS IN SINNING CRIES TO HEAVEN!\nThere has been a prohibition for alcohol, but all bureaucrats, all top-ranking officials, all so-called political leaders were drinking without any problem. They have power – the prohibition is for others; nobody can prevent them. This is meanness.\nEvery political leader exploits his country. He promises the country that he is going to do great things. Those promises are never fulfilled.\nOn the other hand, he goes on filling his treasury with as much money as possible. Those who give money are favored by licenses, by new permissions to make factories. Those who don’t give money are arrested, their houses are searched, and just a small loophole is enough to torture them.\nMan’s meanness is tremendous: One of the prime ministers of India, Indira Gandhi, forced people like Jay Prakash and thousands of others into jail. It was the jail that killed him, because he could not get the right treatment. His kidneys were not functioning, and he was released only when it was certain that now no cure is possible. But at his funeral, Indira Gandhi was present, Rajiv Gandhi was present, Sanjay Gandhi was present. The funeral was almost official. All great leaders and all great officers and generals of armies were present: and they were the real killers of the man.\nWhen Morarji Desai came into power – he was in jail in Indira Gandhi’s time – his whole effort was to force Indira into jail. Are these children? Have they any intelligence and wisdom? And now, even today, the same policy continues. Kirloskar, one of the industrialists of Poona, was arrested and kept five days in jail. And the reason was that he is a relative of Morarji Desai. His daughter is married to Desai’s son.\nRamakrishna Bajaj’s factories and all his offices were raided because he did not contribute to Rajiv Gandhi’s election fund. He was a follower of Jay Prakash and he was against Indira Gandhi. Now those people are being tortured. Of course, they always find some legal jargon to torture people. But meanness is the real sin. One should be clean of all meanness, and that will become a transcendence.\nWHERE IS THE LIGHTNING TO LICK YOU WITH ITS TONGUE? WHERE IS THE MADNESS,\nWITH WHICH YOU SHOULD BE CLEANSED? One needs almost to be so extreme, if he to transcend this ugly humanity, that people will call him mad. They have called Gautam Buddha mad, they have called Jesus mad, they have called Socrates mad. Anybody who is not part of the crowd insanity, who goes beyond it, is condemned by the crowd as mad. But such madness is the only way to be cleansed.\nBEHOLD, I TEACH YOU THE SUPERMAN: HE IS THIS LIGHTNING, HE IS THIS MADNESS!...\nMAN IS A ROPE FASTENED BETWEEN ANIMAL AND SUPERMAN – A ROPE OVER AN ABYSS.\nMan is not a being, but a process – not a being, but a becoming. A dog is born a dog, and dies a dog. It is not absolutely so with man.\nGautam Buddha is born as a man and dies as a god. But to attain to this state, one has to be the lightning that burns all that is rotten in you, and one has to be mad enough to go beyond all the hypocrisies, all the mannerisms, all the facades that man has created to remain where he is without growing.\nMAN IS A ROPE FASTENED BETWEEN ANIMAL AND SUPERMAN – A ROPE OVER AN ABYSS.\nA DANGEROUS GOING-ACROSS, A DANGEROUS WAYFARING, A DANGEROUS LOOKING- BACK, A DANGEROUS SHUDDERING AND STAYING-STILL.\nWhat is great in man is that he is a bridge and not a goal; what can be loved in man is that he is a going-across and a down-going.\nMan is not static: he is change, and that is what is beautiful in him. Man is not dead but alive – that is what is lovable in him. He has to go across from animal to superman. He has also to gather courage to go down from his high peaks of being a superman, to give the message and the joy and the dance to all those who are left behind, who have become static and who are not moving, and who are not changing.\nI LOVE THOSE WHO DO NOT KNOW HOW TO LIVE, EXCEPT THEIR LIVES BE A DOWN- GOING, FOR THEY ARE THOSE WHO ARE GOING ACROSS.\nOne of Zarathustra’s greatest contributions is this: that once you have reached to the point of enlightenment, to the point of awakening, you should not remain there. That is too selfish – you should come back. Because millions of people are there; perhaps their thirst is asleep, perhaps they are not aware of their hunger. You have to provoke them and challenge them, and you have to guide them and you have to show them the path: how they can also go across, how they can also change from the animal to the superman.\nI LOVE THE GREAT DESPISERS, FOR THEY ARE THE GREAT VENERATORS AND ARROWS OF LONGING FOR THE OTHER BANK. THESE WOR+DS SHOULD BE WRITTEN IN GOLD: I LOVE THE GREAT DESPISERS, FOR THEY ARE THE GREAT VENERATORS AND ARROWS OF\nLONGING FOR THE OTHER BANK. A man who has no longing to go beyond, no longing to climb the Everest of consciousness is not worthy to be called a man.\nI LOVE THOSE WHO DO NOT FIRST SEEK BEYOND THE STARS FOR REASONS TO GO DOWN AND TO BE SACRIFICES: BUT WHO SACRIFICE THEMSELVES TO THE EARTH, THAT THE\nEARTH MAY ONE DAY BELONG TO THE SUPERMAN. You have been told by all the religions that to sacrifice yourself to attain the kingdom of God. Zarathustra says, “Sacrifice yourself to the earth that the earth may one day belong to the superman.” Become the herald of the coming morning. Make the way for the superman to happen.\nI LOVE HIM, WHO LIVES FOR KNOWLEDGE AND WHO WANTS KNOWLEDGE THAT ONE DAY THE SUPERMAN MAY LIVE. AND THUS HE WILLS HIS OWN DOWNFALL. A man who wants the\nsuperman is certainly wanting that the man should disappear: the man should disappear into the superman.\nI LOVE HIM WHO LOVES HIS VIRTUE: FOR VIRTUE IS WILL TO DOWNFALL AND AN ARROW OF LONGING.I LOVE HIM WHO DOES NOT WANT TOO MANY VIRTUES. ONE VIRTUE IS\nMORE VIRTUE THAN TWO, BECAUSE IT IS MORE OF A KNOT FOR FATE TO CLING TO.\nOne should be one-pointed, a single arrow with your whole energy. Only then you can pass the dangerous abyss between animal and superman. Many virtues are not needed.\nZarathustra says, I conceive only one virtue: the longing for transcendence, the longing for the beyond. The longing not to remain man, but to go beyond man, to become God.\nI LOVE HIM WHO IS ASHAMED WHEN THE DICE FALL IN HIS FAVOUR AND WHO THEN ASKS:\nAM I THEN A CHEAT? – FOR HE WANTS TO PERISH. It is not a great virtue to be successful, successful as a man, because success needs all kinds of meanness, all kinds of fallacies, all kinds of false promises. Success needs violence. The successful man is not a man of love, is not a man of compassion.\nThe truly compassionate man, the truly loving man is ready to dissolve himself, so that something great may arise. He wants to become the manure for the roses to grow.\nI LOVE HIM WHO THROWS GOLDEN WORDS IN ADVANCE OF HIS DEEDS AND ALWAYS PERFORMS MORE THAN HE PROMISED: FOR HE WILLS HIS OWN DOWNFALL.\nI LOVE HIM WHO JUSTIFIES THE MEN OF THE FUTURE AND REDEEMS THE MEN OF THE PAST: FOR HE WANTS TO PERISH BY THE MEN OF THE PRESENT.\nI LOVE HIM WHO CHASTISES HIS GOD BECAUSE HE LOVES HIS GOD: FOR HE MUST PERISH BY THE ANGER OF HIS GOD.\nI LOVE HIM WHOSE SOUL IS DEEP EVEN IN ITS ABILITY TO BE WOUNDED, AND WHOM EVEN A LITTLE THING CAN DESTROY: THUS HE IS GLAD TO GO OVER THE BRIDGE.\nHe is not afraid of death, because he knows, unless the seed dies the plant will not grow. Unless the seed dies there will not be any flowers. He is ready to die. In this courage he is capable to go gladly over the bridge, which is dangerous.\nThe journey of transcendence is dangerous. You will be disappearing and something new will come into existence. You will be sacrificing yourself for the new to arrive, but this sacrifice is a great bliss, because you are a creator – you have become a womb for the new, and for the great.\nI LOVE ALL THOSE WHO ARE LIKE HEAVY DROPS FALLING SINGLY FROM THE DARK CLOUD THAT HANGS OVER MANKIND: THEY PROPHESY THE COMING OF THE LIGHTNING AND AS PROPHETS THEY PERISH.\nBEHOLD, I AM THE PROPHET OF THE LIGHTNING AND A HEAVY DROP FROM THE CLOUD: BUT THIS LIGHTNING IS CALLED Superman.\nZarathustra is saying that the prophet proclaims about the future, stakes everything for the future, dies for the future, so that this planet can become a paradise; so this humanity need not be mean, need not be anymore full of things which have to be condemned; so that this humanity becomes pure and innocent.\nJust as at the beginning of the rains the clouds come – they herald only the beginning of the rain and the lightning.\nZarathustra says, “I am the prophet of the lightning. I want you to be aware that soon the superman will be appearing. Be ready to receive him.\nThe only way to receive him is to be ready to sacrifice yourself.”\nThis lightning is called superman, because this lightning is the beginning of a new season, of a new climate. The earth will become green, and the dead trees will become alive, and the naked branches will be with foliage, and there will be flowers all around.\nI have told you that my word for the superman is the new man, because the word superman carries in it the idea of superiority. In existence nothing is superior and nothing is inferior – things are only unique, and different.\nThe new man will be different and unique. The new man will not be serious, the new man will have a sense of humor, the new man will not be tense and anxious, and full of anguish; instead he will be full of joy. The new man will be able to dance and sing and play and be a small child.\nThe new man is the hope for the whole of humanity.\n...

the blind and the deaf and the heartless. But his love and his
compassion is such that he does not ask them to be worthy to understand
him.</p><p><br></p><p>I am reminded of Bodhidharma, a man of the same height of
consciousness as Zarathustra. He remained sitting before a wall, facing
the wall, keeping his back towards the audience for nine years. People
would come, but he would talk to the wall; people would ask questions,
but he would answer to the wall.</p><p><br></p><p>The emperor of China, Wu, was very much puzzled with this strange
man. He asked him, “Why do you face the wall? this is absolutely unheard
of. You are talking to the people; you should face them.” Bodhidharma
had tears in his eyes, and still facing the wall he said, “I have talked
for many years to many people, facing them, but I have always found I am
talking to the wall. They hear, but they don’t listen. They appear to
understand, but they only misunderstand.”</p><p><br></p><p>And particularly a man like Zarathustra or Bodhidharma is bound to be
misunderstood, because they are absolutely non-compromising with your
lies, with your beliefs. Their truth is going to shatter you completely.
To protect yourself, either you don’t hear what they are saying or you
interpret it in such a way that it does not disturb you. You will be
extremely surprised that modern research has found that almost
ninety-eight percent is being censored out – only two percent reaches to
you.</p><p><br></p><p>Zarathustra is saying tremendously significant statements which can
become the foundation of a new humanity, but he has to be understood
with great sympathy. He has to be heard not only by your mind, but by
your being too. Unless every cell of your body is thrilled by what he is
saying, you will not understand him.</p><p><br></p><p>Do not depend only on the mind: mind – rather than understanding –
always creates misunderstanding, because mind has already its own
prejudices. It clings to its prejudices. It allows in only those things
which support its prejudices; otherwise it does not allow them in. Or
even if by chance they have entered in, it interprets them, dilutes
them, destroys their fire, takes their living quality. They become just
hypotheses, they lose their reality, they cannot transform you.</p><p><br></p><p>Only a truth that reaches to your heart alive, dancing, is capable of
taking you beyond your present state of consciousness. In these
statements there are thousands of gems spread all over, but one needs to
be a jeweler to understand them.</p><p>An old fable of Aesop is: A farmer is returning home with his donkey,
and finds by the side of the road, perhaps the biggest diamond in
existence, but the poor fellow has no idea that it is a diamond. He has
heard the word, but he has never seen one. Still it is shining so
beautifully in the sunrays, that he thinks, it is a beautiful stone and
I have never given anything to my poor donkey. He will enjoy it very
much. So he ties the stone around the neck of the donkey.</p><p><br></p><p>As they move on, a jeweler approaching on his horse is so shocked: he
has never seen such a great diamond, and that too tied on a donkey’s
neck. He stops his horse and asks the owner of the donkey, “How much
will you take for it?” The farmer said, “It is a stone; perhaps one
rupee will be enough.”</p><p><br></p><p>But greed is such, that the jeweler, knowing it is worth millions of
rupees, says, “You are asking too much just for a stone. I will give you
eight annas, half a rupee.” The farmer thought for a moment, and then he
said, “Then let my donkey enjoy it. I am not selling it.”</p><p><br></p><p>As chance will have it, by great coincidence, another jeweler comes
by in his chariot, and almost has a heart attack when he sees<span class=s4></span>He asked the owner, “How much is the price?” Now the
owner</p><p>started becoming a little alert: The stone seems to be precious. He
said, “Two rupees will do.” Just the poor man’s imagination; two rupees
are too much.</p><p><br></p><p>The first jeweler has gone slowly, just a little bit, hoping that the
farmer will think that eight annas, half a rupee, just for a stone is
too much. He will agree, he just needs a little time.</p><p><br></p><p>But when he saw a chariot standing there, he rushed to the place and
he asked the farmer, “Remember I was the first to enquire the price of
the stone? I am ready to give you one rupee.” The other jeweler said, “I
am ready to give him two rupees.” And there was a contest; the owner was
simply listening. They were talking numbers that he could not
understand.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally the farmer said, “Don’t unnecessarily waste your time; I have
decided not to sell it. I don’t understand your numbers, but one thing
is certain: I have to go to the marketplace and seek a few more opinions
about the stone. The stone is not an ordinary stone, that much is
certain, and I am very grateful to both of you.”</p><p><br></p><p>The first man said, “But you are foolish. We are ready to give lakhs
of rupees.” The farmer laughed, and said to his donkey, “Have you
listened? Who is foolish? I was selling it at one rupee, and I was not
aware that it is something so precious. Then he said to the jeweler,”I
am a poor man, you are a jeweler, you know exactly how much is the
value, and still you did not agree to give me just one rupee. Who is
foolish? I was ignorant of the fact that it has any value, but you were
perfectly aware, and still you wanted to save half a rupee.”</p><p><br></p><p>They both tried. They said, “We will not conflict. We will purchase
it together.” He said, “Now it is too late. I have become aware so I am
going to the market, and I will ask all the jewelers. First, I will have
to find out how much this stone is worth, and then I will think whether
I want to sell it or let my donkey enjoy it.”</p><p><br></p><p>People like Zarathustra, in each of their words, are giving you gems
of immense value. But it depends on your understanding, intelligence,
alertness; otherwise you will hear them just like</p><p>anybody else talking. Remember the same words have different values
when they come from different mouths. When an ignorant man speaks, he
may be using the same words, but they are empty: They don’t have any
value. When a man like Zarathustra speaks, the same words immediately
become so valuable, because the man behind the word is the meaning of
the word. His experience is the content of the word.</p><p><br></p><p>WHAT IS THE GREATEST THING YOU CAN EXPERIENCE? It is almost
impossible to imagine Zarathustra’s answer. He says, IT IS THE HOUR OF
THE GREAT CONTEMPT – the contempt for your ignorance, the contempt for
your hate, the contempt for your jealousy, the contempt for your mundane
life, the contempt for all the animal instincts within you. In short,
the contempt for yourself is the greatest experience you can experience.
And only those who have gone beyond humanity are the people who have
contempt for everything that man consists of.</p><p><br></p><p>It is all rotten: your beliefs are rotten; your ideologies are dead;
your religions are nothing but imprisonments; your philosophies are just
castles in the air.</p><p><br></p><p>What do you have? Your life has not produced, has not been creative
of something that can make the universe more beautiful, more valuable.
You are just a burden on the earth, unnecessarily occupying space,
unnecessarily stopping somebody else who may have been a creator, who
may have been a Zarathustra.</p><p><br></p><p>It hurts for the first time when you hear it: that the greatest thing
you can experience is the hour of the great contempt, the hour in which
even your happiness grows loathsome to you. What is your happiness?...
so mundane, so ordinary, so repetitive: there is nothing great in it.
But nobody thinks about what his happiness consists of. Somebody’s
happiness is good food, somebody’s happiness is sexuality, somebody’s
happiness is accumulation of money, somebody’s happiness is fame,
somebody’s happiness is power.</p><p><br></p><p>Jayesh was telling me the other day that one of his friends was
writing a book on Indira Gandhi, and remained for many months to watch
her life, to ask her questions. One day when they were both alone, he
asked a simple question, and he was shocked when he heard the answer;
you will also be shocked.</p><p><br></p><p>His question was, “We have been discussing great problems –
philosophical, political, social, religious, educational – and today I
want you to answer me a simple thing. What is your hobby in life?”</p><p><br></p><p>That moment in Indira Gandhi’s life must have been of tremendous
honesty and sincerity. One cannot expect politicians to be sincere, but
there are moments. One becomes tired of insincerity, tired of
dishonesty, tired of hypocrisy. She was alone and forgot that she was a
politician, and answered, “My only hobby is power.” But then she must
have recognized immediately what she had said. She implored the man,
“This is off record, it is just a personal chit-chat: You cannot put it
in the book you are writing.” The politician is back.</p><p><br></p><p>Somebody’s happiness is power: power over people, domination,
destruction. What are the constituents of your happiness? If you watch
intelligently, you will be full of contempt. And your reason.… Everybody
thinks that he is a very rational being. But have you ever thought that
you</p><p>have so many superstitions which are a solid evidence of the absence
of reason, not the presence of reason.</p><p><br></p><p>A man of reason cannot have a belief in God. Do you believe in God? A
man of reason cannot believe in heaven and hell. Do you believe? A man
of reason cannot be a Christian, or a Hindu, or a Mohammedan, or a
Buddhist, because these are different kinds of superstitions. Their
differences are not based on any valid evidence. Their differences are
so stupid that if you have reason, you will not be able to believe that
millions of people are living with these superstitions, believing that
they are rational.</p><p><br></p><p>In my university, there was a department for yoga, because the
vice-chancellor was very much interested in yoga. He thought that he is
being very rational, far ahead of his time, because he was the first to
introduce yoga as a department in his university. No other university in
the whole world had a yoga department. He bragged about it.</p><p><br></p><p>One day I could not resist the temptation and I said, “Enough is
enough. I have heard you bragging about this yoga department and you
think you have done a great rational service to humanity. Now I want
rational proofs. All kinds of distortions of the body, how they are
going to help man’s spiritual growth? What relationship is there? And if
spiritual growth happens through these distortions, then the head of the
department of yoga, who knows all yoga exercises to perfection, he
should be a giant like a Gautam Buddha, or a Mahavira.</p><p><br></p><p>“But he is a stupid man. He is a proof that all those distortions of
the body do not help spiritual growth; perhaps they destroy spiritual
growth.” And I have reasons to believe that they destroy. Standing on
your head for hours is going to destroy your very fragile brain cells,
because so much blood will be coming to the mind, like a flood. And your
small head has millions of cells, so tiny and so fragile.</p><p><br></p><p>Animals have not been able to develop intelligence, for the simple
reason their head and their body is in the same horizontal line. Too
much blood runs through their head and does not allow the delicate
framework of a brain to develop. Because man is standing on his feet,
blood has to go against gravitation towards the head, so a very small
amount reaches. That is enough for the nourishment of those cells. It is
not a flood, it is just the right proportion.</p><p><br></p><p>I asked him, “Do you use a pillow when you sleep, or not?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I use a pillow, but what does that have to do with
yoga?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “It does have something to do with it. It keeps your head
intact from the flood that will come if it was horizontal with the body.
You cannot sleep without a pillow, for the simple reason that the flood
is so much it keeps you awake. Your mind cannot be at rest.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “You stop bragging about it; otherwise I will start speaking
against it in the university. And I know the man you think is a
spiritual teacher who heads the department.”</p><p><br></p><p>By chance I had come to know him. I was going to New Delhi in a train
and at a midway junction the compartment was disconnected from the first
train, and was connected to another train that went to</p><p>New Delhi. We both were travelling. I was in the compartment and he
was to catch the compartment at the junction. I had got off, because the
train was going to be there for one hour, so I could take my bath, my
breakfast and a little walk.</p><p><br></p><p>When I came back to my compartment, what did I see? He had removed my
bed, had spread his own bed, and was pretending to be fast asleep. The
train was crowded, and there was not even a space to sit. But because I
was coming from the original place from where the train starts.…</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “This is great.” I shook him, but he would not open his eyes.
I said to him, “Remember, it is only difficult to wake up a man if he is
awake. If he is asleep, it is not a difficult problem. And soon you will
repent.”</p><p><br></p><p>I took all his luggage out of the compartment on to the platform.
Still he managed... thinking that I cannot be so unkind to him. We were
professors in the same university. But I told him, “You have been
ungraceful. You should have asked my permission before you removed my
bed. I will see how long you can sleep, because now there are only ten
minutes more, and the train will leave, and all your luggage is on the
platform.”</p><p><br></p><p>Now he became fidgety, and as he heard the first whistle, he jumped
up. I said, “What happened to your great sleep? I was thinking you are
in samadhi!”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “This is very mischievous of you.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “You started the game, and I believe in tit for tat.”</p><p><br></p><p>But he would not get out. He called a porter from the window, and
asked him to bring the luggage in. But I told the porter that “I will
pay you double. Just keep that luggage on the platform.”</p><p><br></p><p>The porter said, “Of course, whoever pays me more.” And finally the
third whistle, and the train started moving and the yogi jumped out to
take his luggage. Meanwhile, I folded his bed and threw it on the ground
and I was fast asleep. He was very angry, and although I was fast asleep
he started saying to me, “This is not good.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Listen, I am fast asleep. You are not supposed to talk to a
fast-asleep man. You have learnt your lesson!”</p><p><br></p><p>I told the vice-chancellor, “This stupid man you think is a saint,
has some spirituality: he is not even intelligent.</p><p><br></p><p>“Because by a very strange coincidence, the train.<span class=s4></span>In India everything is possible – only on the</p><p>platform will the lights come on, and as the train leaves the
platform, the lights will disappear, the electricity will be gone. The
yoga teacher was sitting on his luggage, because there was no other
place. Once I hit on his head in the darkness, and he said, “Who is
hitting me?” And when the lights came on, he enquired again.</p><p>I said, “Why should anybody hit you, unless you have done something
wrong.” He said, “I have been sitting on my suitcases.”</p><p>I said, “We will see, it is still a long journey and the whole night
is ahead.”</p><p><br></p><p>A woman was sitting on the upper berth. When the light went off
again, I started pulling her saree. So she started screaming, “Somebody
is pulling my saree.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “It is nobody. It is this man who is sitting in front of
you.” And I put the saree in his hands, and he was such an idiot, that
he took it.</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “What is it?” Then the station came, and the whole
compartment was against him: “Throw this man out. He is pretending to be
a saint, and pulls the saree of a poor woman who is sitting here.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Now you know that you must be doing something wrong; that’s
why somebody was hitting you.”</p><p><br></p><p>He went to the bathroom, and I told the two people who were sitting
on both sides of him, “This man has to be thrown out some way, because
this is absolutely against Indian culture. In the West it is okay, but
in India a monk who pretends to be a celibate and is pulling the saree
of a woman cannot be tolerated.” So they said, “What should be
done?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “You do one thing: when he sits down you press him from both
sides.” They said, “That’s a good idea.”</p><p>In the darkness the yogi started shouting, “Two people are pushing me
from both sides.” And at that very moment I hit him again, and he said,
“Just forgive me, I will change compartments.”</p><p><br></p><p>As the light came on again at another station, he asked the people
who were sitting by his side, “Why were you pushing me?” They said,
“Strange, you seem to be a man of imagination. Why should we push you?”
And he said, “Somebody hit me again on the head.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “It is your yoga that has led you into hallucinations.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I want to go out of this compartment. I want to change
compartments.” I said, “You cannot.”</p><p>He said, “Why?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “The whole compartment is agreed on the point that you should
be punished the whole night. You can go out, but your luggage we will
not allow you to take out.”</p><p><br></p><p>And of course he could not leave his luggage, so the whole night all
kinds of things were done to him, and in the morning I told him, getting
out at New Delhi station, “You created the game. If you had not
pretended... if you had told me that you are tired and you want rest, I
would have moved my bed – but you threw it down. And I don’t believe
that if you do something wrong in this life, you will be punished in
another life. I believe: cash payment! You have been punished enough.
Never do such a thing again.”</p><p>He said, “I will never do it again. Just do me one favor: don’t talk
about it back in the university.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “That I cannot do. I never give any promises. And this whole
night has been so juicy, that I am really in a hurry to go back to the
university and tell the vice-chancellor and tell all those idiots who
are learning yoga exercises from you.”</p><p><br></p><p>Not a single yogi in the centuries past has created anything, has
discovered anything, has shown any genius.</p><p><br></p><p>Just look at what your reason is, and you will feel a contempt for
your reason. It is full of blind beliefs, unproved hypotheses,
unexperienced faith. Without any proof, without any argument, you are
carrying your religion, your philosophy; and you call it reason? It is a
thing you should have great contempt for. And for your virtue also.</p><p><br></p><p>What is your virtue? Almost everybody thinks he is virtuous. Because
you have given some alms to a beggar, you are virtuous? Have you ever
thought, in the first place why beggars exist? You exploit and create
beggars, and then you give just a small portion – and you become a great
virtuous man.</p><p><br></p><p>What is your virtue? You don’t have anything to give really; you
don’t have love, you don’t have joy, you don’t have any blissfulness:
what can you give? All that you have is money, and money is soaked with
the blood of those same people. It is a strange game: first make them
beggars – then give them alms; and you are virtuous. Give something to
an orphanage, and you are virtuous. And most probably that orphanage is
having your children, produced by prostitutes. You produce those
orphans. You talk against prostitution – if you ask people you will not
find a single person who is in favor of prostitution – then why do
prostitutes exist? Who goes there?</p><p><br></p><p>Poor people cannot go – they don’t have the money. It is the rich
people, the middle class people who can afford to go. The middle class
people have to go to the prostitutes. The rich class people don’t go
there. They have created a new class of prostitutes:call-girls. You just
dial their number, and they will be available at your place. And all
these people are against prostitutes.</p><p><br></p><p>Your priests have been found, all over the world, exploiting
sexually, and abusing sexually, small children. Many of them have been
jailed. And it does not mean that those who have not been caught are not
doing something of the same kind. Most of your monks, saddhus, nuns,
sadhvis – are either homosexuals or lesbians, and they are talking
against sex, talking about celibacy, but it is only talk.</p><p><br></p><p>What is your virtue? You will feel a great contempt for it. It is
hypocrisy. It is not virtue. Zarathustra is very strong.</p><p>WHAT IS THE GREATEST THING YOU CAN EXPERIENCE? IT IS THE HOUR OF THE
GREAT CONTEMPT. THE HOUR IN WHICH EVEN YOUR HAPPINESS GROWS LOATHSOME TO
YOU, AND YOUR REASON AND YOUR VIRTUE ALSO.</p><p><br></p><p>THE HOUR WHEN YOU SAY: ‘WHAT GOOD IS MY HAPPINESS?’ IT IS POVERTY AND
DIRT</p><p>AND A MISERABLE EASE. Just look closely, what is your happiness? What
are the situations which make you happy? And you will feel a great
contempt for them.</p><p>BUT MY HAPPINESS SHOULD JUSTIFY EXISTENCE ITSELF! Zarathustra says,
“My happiness is not of miserable ease, of dirt, of poverty. My
happiness springs from my own being. It justifies existence.” Your
happiness does not arise from yourself. Your name comes up in a lottery
and you are happy. What does it prove? Only your poverty. Only a poor
man can be happy because a lottery came up in his name.</p><p><br></p><p>Anything that comes from outside and makes you happy makes you also a
slave, makes you also dependent. What kind of happiness is it that
destroys your freedom, that destroys you?</p><p><br></p><p>Leo Tolstoy has a beautiful story: A poor tailor used to purchase a
ticket every month for the lottery. He had been doing it for twenty
years but the lottie never came up in his name. His family, his friends
got tired, and told him, “Why do you waste money? You are so poor, but
the ticket has to be purchased. It has become almost a religious
ritual.”</p><p><br></p><p>But one day the miracle happened. A black limousine came to the poor
tailor’s shop and a man came out with a big bag – the tailor had won the
lottery! He could not believe it, but he had to believe it when the
money was delivered to him.</p><p><br></p><p>He was so happy. He locked the door of his shop and threw the key in
a well, because now what is the point. He has so much money, he can live
his whole life comfortably, enjoying all that is available in the world.
But he was not aware that money goes very fast – in prostitutes, in
alcohol, in gambling. All kinds of things that he had never imagined, he
went through. He lost his health and within two years all the money was
gone.</p><p><br></p><p>He came back to his shop. People said, “What happened? You look so
old!” He said, “That goddamned lottery that destroyed my health, that
took me to places where I should never have been. But what can you do
with money? It is a constant temptation. All is lost; Please help me to
find my key.” Some young man went into the well, searched for his key;
the key was found, he opened his shop, started his work.</p><p><br></p><p>But just out of old habit, he still continued to purchase one ticket
every month. Now people said, “Why are you doing it? It has not been a
blessing to you, it has been a curse.” He said, “I know, and I know that
it is not going to happen again; and I don’t want it to happen again.”
They said, “This is strange, then why do you go on purchasing the
ticket?” He said, “If I don’t purchase the ticket, the whole month I
feel something is missing. It has become my lifelong habit. I am
addicted, so don’t prevent me from purchasing the ticket. You know, for
twenty years nothing happened, and I cannot think I have twenty more
years to live. Those two years have destroyed me completely.”</p><p><br></p><p>But when miracles happen, they happen in a chain. Next year, again
the black limousine came, and he said, “My God! Now I am finished.” The
people said, “You need not do all those things.” He again locked the
door, threw the key into the well and he said, “Now there will be no
need to take it out, because I don’t think I can survive. The first
lottery almost finished me – seventy-five percent, and this one will
finish the remaining twenty-five percent.”</p><p><br></p><p>Such is the unconsciousness of man. Again the same round of
prostitutes, of drinking alcohol, of gambling.<span class=s4></span>What is your happiness? Is it a blessing?</p><p>Just a few days ago, I was informed that in America almost one
million people suffer from a headache when they make love, and for the
next two days the migraine remains. But the strangest thing is they go
on doing the same thing again and again, knowing perfectly well that
migraine will come, and for two days they will have to suffer. They
don’t enjoy sex, they cannot; it is a curse to them, but the stupidity,
the insanity, the unawareness, leads them. After two, three days, when
the migraine is gone, they start feeling again an urge – they have
forgotten. Perhaps they have started hoping that it may not happen
again. Their whole life is a proof that it has been happening again and
again.</p><p><br></p><p>What is your happiness? Unless your happiness comes from within you,
just as flowers come from the inner juices of the tree<span class=s4></span>If your happiness is a flower of your being, it
justifies existence. All</p><p>your so-called happiness of power, and money, and prestige is just a
migraine.</p><p><br></p><p>THE HOUR WHEN YOU SAY: ’WHAT GOOD IS MY REASON? DOES IT LONG FOR
KNOWLEDGE AS THE LION FOR ITS FOOD?</p><p><br></p><p>IT IS POVERTY AND DIRT AND A MISERABLE EASE!’ An authentic, reasoning
man is always in search of truth. Reason is the hunger for truth. Is
your reason a hunger for truth? Is your reason a thirst for truth? Are
you ready to sacrifice everything to find the truth? Just as the lion
goes in search of food, reason goes in search of truth, in search of
wisdom. Any other reason is nothing but dirt, poverty, and a miserable
ease.</p><p><br></p><p>THE HOUR WHEN YOU SAY: ‘WHAT GOOD IS MY VIRTUE? IT HAS NOT YET DRIVEN
ME MAD!’</p><p><br></p><p>A virtuous man cannot compromise with the lies of the society. A
virtuous man will destroy the causes, not the symptoms. He will not be
satisfied and comfortable by giving donations to a few institutions.</p><p><br></p><p>Anando was seeing a chartered accountant in Bombay who has a
charitable trust – tax exempt. The trust is for providing food for stray
dogs, so he goes in his car, with food for the dogs. Those stray dogs
are in the poor sections of Bombay, where hungry boys and girls are
standing – and he is feeding the dogs! He is thought to be a very
virtuous, a very charitable man. What kind of virtue is this? And he
feels great pride that he is the only one who takes care of the stray
dogs.</p><p><br></p><p>Humanity is going to die. Half of this country is going to starve to
death by the end of this century; but he is immensely happy that he is
taking care of stray dogs. The poor boys are standing there with their
big bellies and thin limbs, hungry, hoping that somebody will give
something to them. But his virtue, his charity, does not include them.
He has found a good way to feel himself a pious man, a religious
man.</p><p><br></p><p>The same man is ready to take any kind of bribe. In fact, all that
virtue is a very minimum part of all the bribes that he accumulates.
Taking bribes is not a problem: because, he is making absolute
arrangements in the otherworld by feeding the dogs.</p><p><br></p><p>Is your virtue just a cover-up of all your sins, of all your
unvirtuous acts, of all your inhuman behavior to human beings?</p><p><br></p><p>THE HOUR WHEN YOU SAY: ‘WHAT GOOD IS MY PITY? IS NOT PITY THE CROSS
UPON WHICH HE WHO LOVES MAN IS NAILED? BUT MY PITY IS NO
CRUCIFIXION!’</p><p>Jesus Christ is crucified, but none of his popes, in two thousand
years, has been crucified, and they are his representatives. Yes, they
have a golden cross hanging around their neck on a golden chain. What a
great capacity to deceive yourself! Your neck has to be on the cross,
not the cross hanging on your neck; and that too of gold.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus was only thirty-three years old, a young man and a carpenter’s
son, accustomed to carrying big logs and wood from the forest to his
father’s shop. He was given such a big and heavy cross that he fell
three times before he reached to the destination. It was not made of
gold. There were soldiers around him, lashing him when he fell: “Get up!
Take the cross on your shoulders, and move.”</p><p><br></p><p>If your compassion, your pity, is just a comfortable idea, you should
feel contempt for it.</p><p><br></p><p>The pope runs a bank; Jesus was a beggar. The pope’s bank has been
found guilty of changing black money into white – millions of dollars –
that is its whole business, and those millions of black dollars, changed
into white money, are coming from the sale of heroin and other drugs.
The pope goes on giving sermons against drugs, and the whole Vatican is
supported by the money that comes from the drug sales.</p><p><br></p><p>The Italian government has issued an arrest warrant for the director
of the pope’s bank. But they cannot enter the Vatican, because that
eight square mile area is considered to be an independent country. It is
in the middle of Rome. The man who was the head of the bank was only a
bishop. Rather than handing him over to the police he has been promoted.
Now he has become an archbishop; and the pope is hiding him. The Italian
police cannot enter into the Vatican, and the business continues.</p><p><br></p><p>The pope goes on preaching around the world that religious people
should not take part in politics, and he sent one hundred million
dollars to a party in Poland to fight against the communists. If that is
not taking part in politics, then what is taking part in politics? Man
is such a deceiver; not only deceiving others, he deceives himself.</p><p><br></p><p>Zarathustra is right: if you look into those qualities for which you
feel proud, you will feel contempt, and that is the greatest thing that
can happen to a man, because only after that contempt will you make some
effort to go beyond man, towards the superman.</p><p><br></p><p>HAVE YOU EVER SPOKEN THUS? HAVE YOU EVER CRIED THUS? AH, THAT I HAD
HEARD</p><p>YOU CRYING THUS! Deep down, however clever and cunning you may be,
you ARE aware that your virtue is false, your religion is a formality,
your morality is a social mannerism, your honesty is just a facade.</p><p><br></p><p>IT IS NOT YOUR SIN, – and this is a great statement – IT IS NOT YOUR
SIN, BUT YOUR MODERATION THAT CRIES TO HEAVEN, YOUR VERY MEANNESS IN
SINNING CRIES TO</p><p>HEAVEN! He is saying that the superman will be total in every one of
his acts. Totality will be his joy and his reward. What you call sin is
not the problem, but your moderation. You sin, but halfheartedly. You
cannot even sin with your totality. You cannot even be sincere in your
sin.</p><p><br></p><p>Zarathustra is against what you have heard Confucius teaching: the
golden mean. Confucius is more a social and political thinker: Never go
to the extreme, always remain in the middle. But</p><p>remaining in the middle, you will never be able to live anything in
its totality. The insight of Zarathustra is: if you can live your life
of sin in totality it will disappear. It is your moderation that causes
it to go on lingering your whole life. It is your hypocrisy that does
not allow it to be experienced, because the experience itself will be
such you will not repeat it. But because you are halfhearted, the
incomplete experience goes on urging you to complete it. Every
incomplete experience has the tendency for completion.</p><p><br></p><p>IT IS NOT YOUR SIN, BUT YOUR MODERATION THAT CRIES TO HEAVEN, YOUR
VERY MEANNESS IN SINNING CRIES TO HEAVEN!</p><p><br></p><p>There has been a prohibition for alcohol, but all bureaucrats, all
top-ranking officials, all so-called political leaders were drinking
without any problem. They have power – the prohibition is for others;
nobody can prevent them. This is meanness.</p><p><br></p><p>Every political leader exploits his country. He promises the country
that he is going to do great things. Those promises are never
fulfilled.</p><p><br></p><p>On the other hand, he goes on filling his treasury with as much money
as possible. Those who give money are favored by licenses, by new
permissions to make factories. Those who don’t give money are arrested,
their houses are searched, and just a small loophole is enough to
torture them.</p><p><br></p><p>Man’s meanness is tremendous: One of the prime ministers of India,
Indira Gandhi, forced people like Jay Prakash and thousands of others
into jail. It was the jail that killed him, because he could not get the
right treatment. His kidneys were not functioning, and he was released
only when it was certain that now no cure is possible. But at his
funeral, Indira Gandhi was present, Rajiv Gandhi was present, Sanjay
Gandhi was present. The funeral was almost official. All great leaders
and all great officers and generals of armies were present: and they
were the real killers of the man.</p><p><br></p><p>When Morarji Desai came into power – he was in jail in Indira
Gandhi’s time – his whole effort was to force Indira into jail. Are
these children? Have they any intelligence and wisdom? And now, even
today, the same policy continues. Kirloskar, one of the industrialists
of Poona, was arrested and kept five days in jail. And the reason was
that he is a relative of Morarji Desai. His daughter is married to
Desai’s son.</p><p><br></p><p>Ramakrishna Bajaj’s factories and all his offices were raided because
he did not contribute to Rajiv Gandhi’s election fund. He was a follower
of Jay Prakash and he was against Indira Gandhi. Now those people are
being tortured. Of course, they always find some legal jargon to torture
people. But meanness is the real sin. One should be clean of all
meanness, and that will become a transcendence.</p><p><br></p><p>WHERE IS THE LIGHTNING TO LICK YOU WITH ITS TONGUE? WHERE IS THE
MADNESS,</p><p>WITH WHICH YOU SHOULD BE CLEANSED? One needs almost to be so extreme,
if he to transcend this ugly humanity, that people will call him mad.
They have called Gautam Buddha mad, they have called Jesus mad, they
have called Socrates mad. Anybody who is not part of the crowd insanity,
who goes beyond it, is condemned by the crowd as mad. But such madness
is the only way to be cleansed.</p><p><br></p><p>BEHOLD, I TEACH YOU THE SUPERMAN: HE IS THIS LIGHTNING, HE IS THIS
MADNESS!...</p><p>MAN IS A ROPE FASTENED BETWEEN ANIMAL AND SUPERMAN – A ROPE OVER AN
ABYSS.</p><p>Man is not a being, but a process – not a being, but a becoming. A
dog is born a dog, and dies a dog. It is not absolutely so with man.</p><p><br></p><p>Gautam Buddha is born as a man and dies as a god. But to attain to
this state, one has to be the lightning that burns all that is rotten in
you, and one has to be mad enough to go beyond all the hypocrisies, all
the mannerisms, all the facades that man has created to remain where he
is without growing.</p><p><br></p><p>MAN IS A ROPE FASTENED BETWEEN ANIMAL AND SUPERMAN – A ROPE OVER AN
ABYSS.</p><p><br></p><p>A DANGEROUS GOING-ACROSS, A DANGEROUS WAYFARING, A DANGEROUS LOOKING-
BACK, A DANGEROUS SHUDDERING AND STAYING-STILL.</p><p><br></p><p>What is great in man is that he is a bridge and not a goal; what can
be loved in man is that he is a going-across and a down-going.</p><p><br></p><p>Man is not static: he is change, and that is what is beautiful in
him. Man is not dead but alive – that is what is lovable in him. He has
to go across from animal to superman. He has also to gather courage to
go down from his high peaks of being a superman, to give the message and
the joy and the dance to all those who are left behind, who have become
static and who are not moving, and who are not changing.</p><p><br></p><p>I LOVE THOSE WHO DO NOT KNOW HOW TO LIVE, EXCEPT THEIR LIVES BE A
DOWN- GOING, FOR THEY ARE THOSE WHO ARE GOING ACROSS.</p><p><br></p><p>One of Zarathustra’s greatest contributions is this: that once you
have reached to the point of enlightenment, to the point of awakening,
you should not remain there. That is too selfish – you should come back.
Because millions of people are there; perhaps their thirst is asleep,
perhaps they are not aware of their hunger. You have to provoke them and
challenge them, and you have to guide them and you have to show them the
path: how they can also go across, how they can also change from the
animal to the superman.</p><p><br></p><p>I LOVE THE GREAT DESPISERS, FOR THEY ARE THE GREAT VENERATORS AND
ARROWS OF LONGING FOR THE OTHER BANK. THESE WOR+DS SHOULD BE WRITTEN IN
GOLD: I LOVE THE GREAT DESPISERS, FOR THEY ARE THE GREAT VENERATORS AND
ARROWS OF</p><p>LONGING FOR THE OTHER BANK. A man who has no longing to go beyond, no
longing to climb the Everest of consciousness is not worthy to be called
a man.</p><p><br></p><p>I LOVE THOSE WHO DO NOT FIRST SEEK BEYOND THE STARS FOR REASONS TO GO
DOWN AND TO BE SACRIFICES: BUT WHO SACRIFICE THEMSELVES TO THE EARTH,
THAT THE</p><p>EARTH MAY ONE DAY BELONG TO THE SUPERMAN. You have been told by all
the religions that to sacrifice yourself to attain the kingdom of God.
Zarathustra says, “Sacrifice yourself to the earth that the earth may
one day belong to the superman.” Become the herald of the coming
morning. Make the way for the superman to happen.</p><p><br></p><p>I LOVE HIM, WHO LIVES FOR KNOWLEDGE AND WHO WANTS KNOWLEDGE THAT ONE
DAY THE SUPERMAN MAY LIVE. AND THUS HE WILLS HIS OWN DOWNFALL. A man who
wants the</p><p>superman is certainly wanting that the man should disappear: the man
should disappear into the superman.</p><p><br></p><p>I LOVE HIM WHO LOVES HIS VIRTUE: FOR VIRTUE IS WILL TO DOWNFALL AND
AN ARROW OF LONGING.<span class=s4></span>I LOVE HIM WHO DOES NOT WANT
TOO MANY VIRTUES. ONE VIRTUE IS</p><p>MORE VIRTUE THAN TWO, BECAUSE IT IS MORE OF A KNOT FOR FATE TO CLING
TO.</p><p><br></p><p>One should be one-pointed, a single arrow with your whole energy.
Only then you can pass the dangerous abyss between animal and superman.
Many virtues are not needed.</p><p><br></p><p>Zarathustra says, I conceive only one virtue: the longing for
transcendence, the longing for the beyond. The longing not to remain
man, but to go beyond man, to become God.</p><p><br></p><p>I LOVE HIM WHO IS ASHAMED WHEN THE DICE FALL IN HIS FAVOUR AND WHO
THEN ASKS:</p><p>AM I THEN A CHEAT? – FOR HE WANTS TO PERISH. It is not a great virtue
to be successful, successful as a man, because success needs all kinds
of meanness, all kinds of fallacies, all kinds of false promises.
Success needs violence. The successful man is not a man of love, is not
a man of compassion.</p><p><br></p><p>The truly compassionate man, the truly loving man is ready to
dissolve himself, so that something great may arise. He wants to become
the manure for the roses to grow.</p><p><br></p><p>I LOVE HIM WHO THROWS GOLDEN WORDS IN ADVANCE OF HIS DEEDS AND ALWAYS
PERFORMS MORE THAN HE PROMISED: FOR HE WILLS HIS OWN DOWNFALL.</p><p><br></p><p>I LOVE HIM WHO JUSTIFIES THE MEN OF THE FUTURE AND REDEEMS THE MEN OF
THE PAST: FOR HE WANTS TO PERISH BY THE MEN OF THE PRESENT.</p><p><br></p><p>I LOVE HIM WHO CHASTISES HIS GOD BECAUSE HE LOVES HIS GOD: FOR HE
MUST PERISH BY THE ANGER OF HIS GOD.</p><p><br></p><p>I LOVE HIM WHOSE SOUL IS DEEP EVEN IN ITS ABILITY TO BE WOUNDED, AND
WHOM EVEN A LITTLE THING CAN DESTROY: THUS HE IS GLAD TO GO OVER THE
BRIDGE.</p><p><br></p><p>He is not afraid of death, because he knows, unless the seed dies the
plant will not grow. Unless the seed dies there will not be any flowers.
He is ready to die. In this courage he is capable to go gladly over the
bridge, which is dangerous.</p><p><br></p><p>The journey of transcendence is dangerous. You will be disappearing
and something new will come into existence. You will be sacrificing
yourself for the new to arrive, but this sacrifice is a great bliss,
because you are a creator – you have become a womb for the new, and for
the great.</p><p><br></p><p>I LOVE ALL THOSE WHO ARE LIKE HEAVY DROPS FALLING SINGLY FROM THE
DARK CLOUD THAT HANGS OVER MANKIND: THEY PROPHESY THE COMING OF THE
LIGHTNING AND AS PROPHETS THEY PERISH.</p><p><br></p><p>BEHOLD, I AM THE PROPHET OF THE LIGHTNING AND A HEAVY DROP FROM THE
CLOUD: BUT THIS LIGHTNING IS CALLED Superman.</p><p>Zarathustra is saying that the prophet proclaims about the future,
stakes everything for the future, dies for the future, so that this
planet can become a paradise; so this humanity need not be mean, need
not be anymore full of things which have to be condemned; so that this
humanity becomes pure and innocent.</p><p><br></p><p>Just as at the beginning of the rains the clouds come – they herald
only the beginning of the rain and the lightning.</p><p><br></p><p>Zarathustra says, “I am the prophet of the lightning. I want you to
be aware that soon the superman will be appearing. Be ready to receive
him.</p><p><br></p><p>The only way to receive him is to be ready to sacrifice
yourself.”</p><p><br></p><p>This lightning is called superman, because this lightning is the
beginning of a new season, of a new climate. The earth will become
green, and the dead trees will become alive, and the naked branches will
be with foliage, and there will be flowers all around.</p><p><br></p><p>I have told you that my word for the superman is the new man, because
the word superman carries in it the idea of superiority. In existence
nothing is superior and nothing is inferior – things are only unique,
and different.</p><p><br></p><p>The new man will be different and unique. The new man will not be
serious, the new man will have a sense of humor, the new man will not be
tense and anxious, and full of anguish; instead he will be full of joy.
The new man will be able to dance and sing and play and be a small
child.</p><p><br></p><p>The new man is the hope for the whole of humanity.</p><p><br></p><p>... THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA.</p><p><br></p><p>Okay, Maneesha?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, Osho.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part3>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

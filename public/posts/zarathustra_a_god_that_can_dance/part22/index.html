THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA.\nAN ANCIENT STORY: A young devil comes running to his boss. He is trembling, and he says to the old devil, “Something has to be done immediately, because on the earth one man has found the truth! And once people know the truth, what will happen to our profession?”\nThe old man laughed, and he said, “Sit down and rest and don’t be worried. Everything is taken care of. Our people have reached there.”\n“But,” he said, “I am coming from there. I have not seen a single devil there.”\nThe old man said, “The priests are my people. They have already surrounded the man who has found the truth. Now they will become the mediators between the man of truth and the masses. They will raise temples, they will write scriptures, they will interpret and distort everything. They will ask people to worship, to pray. And in all this hubbub, the truth will be lost. This is my old method, which has always succeeded.”\nThe priests who represent religion are not its friends. They are the greatest enemies of it, because religion needs no mediators: between you and existence there is an immediate relatedness. All that you have to learn is how to understand the language of existence. You know the languages of man, but they are not the languages of existence.\nExistence knows only one language:\nAnd that is of silence.\nIf you can also be silent you will be able to understand the truth, the meaning of life, the significance of all that exists. And there is no one who can interpret it for you. Everyone has to find it for himself. Nobody can do the job on your behalf – but that’s what the priests have been doing for centuries. They are standing like a China Wall between you and existence.\nJust a few days ago, the Vatican pope informed all the Catholics, “It is being told again and again to me that many Catholics are confessing to God directly. They are not going to the confession booth, to the priest. I declare it a sin to confess directly to God. You have to confess to the priest; you cannot relate to God directly.”\nHe has not given any reason, because there is no reason at all, except that the priest has to be kept in his profession – and he himself is a high priest.\nIf people start approaching reality without anybody leading them, without anybody telling them what is good and what is evil, without anybody giving them a map that they have to follow, millions of people will be able to understand existence – because our heartbeat is also the heartbeat of the universe, our life is part of the life of the total.\nWe are not strangers, we are not coming from somewhere else; we are growing within existence. We are part of it, an essential part of it. We just have to be silent enough, so that we can hear that which cannot be said in words: the music of existence, the immense joy of existence, the constant celebration of existence. Once it starts penetrating our heart, transformation comes.\nThat is the only way somebody becomes religious – not by going to the churches which are made by man, not by reading the scriptures which are made by man. But the priests have been pretending that their holy scriptures are written by God. The very idea is simply idiotic. Just look into those scriptures: You will not find any signature of God in them. You will find things which there is no reason for God to write.\nHindus believe in the VEDAS and believe that they are written by God himself, and they are the most ancient books in existence; but no Hindu bothers to look into them. If God wrote them, there is going to be something immensely valuable... but ninety-eight percent of the VEDAS are just rubbish – such rubbish that it proves that they are not written by God.\nFor example a prayer by a priest... why should God write it? And the prayer is that his cows are not giving enough milk, “Have mercy on me, increase the milk of my cows.” Not only that, “Decrease the milk of everybody else’s!” – God is going to write this? “Kill my enemies and help my friends” and even such stupid things as “Rains are coming; take care that all the water reaches my fields and avoids the neighboring field, because it belongs to my enemy. Just shower your water on my field.”\nWhy should God write these things? Every scripture gives intrinsic evidence that they are written by men, and very stupid men, primitive men. The so-called holy scriptures are not even to be counted as good literature – they are childish, crude, ugly. But because they are written in languages which are dead... and some are in languages which have never been in use by common people, for example, the VEDAS. That language has never been used by the common people. It was the language of the learned brahmins, the language of the priests.\nAnd they were very reluctant that it should be translated, because they knew: once it is translated, it will lose all sanctity. People will see that this nonsense is not even unholy – what to say about its being holy!\nSo much obscenity, so much pornography is in the holy scriptures of all your religions. But they are written in Sanskrit, which is not used by common people; in Arabic, which is not used by common people; in Hebrew, which is not used by common people; in Pali, in Prakrit. Those languages are dead. And all the religions are reluctant that their holy scriptures should be brought in to the modern languages which people understand – although, in spite of their reluctance, their holy scriptures have been translated.\nFirst they were against their being printed; second they were against their being translated. The only reason was, they knew that once they were printed they would be sold all over the world, anybody could purchase them. And if they are translated into living languages, then how long can you hide the truth?, and how are you going to prove that they are written by God?\nThe scriptures are man-made, the statues of God are man-made, the temples and churches are man-made, but thousands of years of conditioning has given them a certain sacredness, holiness. And there is nothing sacred in them, nothing holy in them.\nThe priests have been deceiving man more than anybody else. This is the worst profession in the world, even worse than the profession of the prostitutes. At least the prostitute gives you something in return; the priest gives you simply hot air – he has nothing to give to you.\nAnd this is not all: Whenever somebody has realized the truth, these priests are against him. Obviously they have to be, because if his truth is recognized by people, millions of priests in the world will be out of employment. And their employment is absolutely unproductive. They are parasites, they go on sucking the blood of man. From the moment the child is born, until he enters his grave, the priest goes on finding ways to exploit him.\nUnless religion is freed from the hands of the priests, the world will remain only with pseudo-religion; it will never become religious. And a religious world can not be so miserable: the religious world should be a constant celebration.\nA religious man is nothing but pure ecstasy. His heart is full of songs.\nHis whole being is ready to dance any moment.\nBut the priest has taken away the search for truth: He says there is no need for searching, it has already been found, you just have to have faith.\nThe priest has made people miserable, because he condemns all the pleasures of the world. He condemns the pleasures of the world so that he can praise the pleasures of the other world.\nThe other world is his fiction. And he wants humanity to sacrifice its reality for a fictitious idea – and people have sacrificed.\nZarathustra is not alone in condemning the priests. Gautam Buddha is with him, Mahavira is with him, Lao Tzu is with him. Gautam Buddha, Mahavira, and Lao Tzu condemn the priests, but very mildly. Zarathustra calls a spade a spade. He is absolutely realistic. He does not care about etiquette, manners, culture. He says whatsoever he experiences as the truth.\nAND ONE DAY ZARATHUSTRA MADE A SIGN TO HIS DISCIPLES AND SPOKE THESE WORDS TO THEM:\nHERE ARE PRIESTS: AND ALTHOUGH THEY ARE MY ENEMIES, PASS THEM BY QUIETLY\nAND WITH SLEEPING SWORDS! Zarathustra is very simple, innocent; speaks like a child. Gautam Buddha will not call them “my enemies,” he will go round about.\nZarathustra hates directly.\nThe priests are not only enemies of Zarathustra, they are enemies of everyone who loves truth, who is in search of truth or who has found the truth. The closer you are to the truth, the more the priest is your enemy. You are disturbing his customers, you are disturbing his business. Religion to him is business.\nThe Christian churches in America were against me for the simple reason that so many young men and women have come out of their fold. My people don’t belong to any religion. They are religious, and for being religious you don’t have to belong to any religion.\nReligiousness is a quality, a fragrance of your consciousness. It has nothing to do with belonging to an organization, following fixed and dead principles, decided by people who have been long, long dead. To look at it differently, in the name of religion the dead are dominating the living: they are dictating to you how you should live. They don’t know anything about the vast changes that have happened since they died.\nWe are living in a totally different world, in a totally different time and we need every day a spontaneous awareness to respond to reality. And we go on failing because our response is not spontaneous: the reality is new and our response is thousands of years old. Our failure is absolutely certain and that constant failure brings misery in life.\nHERE ARE PRIESTS, says Zarathustra to his disciples, AND ALTHOUGH THEY ARE MY ENEMIES, PASS THEM BY QUIETLY, don’t quarrel with them. They are very efficient in quarreling.\nThey have refined their arguments. They don’t have anything else to do, they only argue. It is better, to PASS THEM BY QUIETLY AND WITH SLEEPING SWORDS.\nDon’t fight with them. Because you are new, you have not yet experienced the truth – that is the problem. They can disturb you, they can lead you astray. You don’t know the truth, nor do they know the truth, but they know the arguments, sophistry. They can convince your minds for anything they want. All priests belong to the category of the sophists.\nOne of my vice-chancellors was a world-renowned law-expert. He had three offices: one in London, one in New Delhi, one in Peking, and he was running continually from Peking to Delhi, from Delhi to London. He had the biggest cases on his hands – of maharajas, kings, queens – but he was a drunkard. He earned enough money; and when he retired, he donated the whole of the money so that a university could be founded. So he was the founder vice-chancellor of the university that he created.\nI used to go for a morning walk, and he was the only one whom I used to meet on my morning walks. By and by we became very friendly and very close. One day I was talking about sophistry, and he remembered one of his cases that he had fought in the Privy Council, in London. The case was between the Maharaja of Jaipur and the Maharaja of Udaipur. It was a big case but the night before he drank too much, and in the morning there was still the hang-over.\nHe went to the court. In his drunkenness he forgot completely that he was fighting for the Maharaja of Jaipur. Everybody was astonished because e started criticizing the Maharaja of Jaipur. He gave great arguments, brought all the precedents, all the legal support. Even the judges were looking at each other: What had happened to this man? – he was supposed to fight for the Maharaja of Jaipur. The man who was going to fight for the Maharaja of Udaipur could not believe what is happening: Now what is he going to do?\nHe was so convincing, that at lunch-time, when the court dissolved, his secretary said, “What are you doing? Are you fighting for the Maharaja of Jaipur or for the Maharaja of Udaipur?”\nHe said, “I drank too much last night. I do not know for whom I am fighting, for what I am fighting, but I had to say something. Do you think I was on the wrong side?”\nThe secretary said, “Absolutely wrong – and you have convinced the judges. Even the advocate who is going to argue against you, feels completely lost, because you have done his job already.”\nHe said, “Do not be worried. So I am for the Maharaja of Jaipur. Just you remain standing by my side and go on pulling my coat, so I don’t forget again. I am still not absolutely out of the influence of the alcohol: I look at the judge and I see two judges and I know – that is my criterion.”\nIn the second half, after lunch, he said to the judge, “Before lunch I spoke in favour of the Maharaja of Udaipur and against the Maharaja of Jaipur. That was only half my argument. I was preparing the ground. These are the arguments that can be given by the opposing advocate. Now I will begin to destroy all those arguments, because I am here to protect the Maharaja of Jaipur and his interests.”\nThis was a new revelation to everybody and even the judge could not believe that he would be able to contradict what he had established so clearly. But he contradicted it. Now he argued against himself and he won the case.\nSo he was telling me that sophistry is a prostitute. Arguments don’t prove anything: A little better argumentation and they can be demolished. If you don’t have the experience, it is dangerous to get into a quarrel, into argumentation, into sophistry, because your mind, having no experience, can be convinced by arguments for something which is not true.\nThe advice of Zarathustra is: first have the experience – then there is no need to be afraid of any argument, because no argument can destroy your experience. Your experience has a quality of being self evident.\nTHEY ARE BAD ENEMIES: NOTHING IS MORE REVENGEFUL THAN THEIR HUMILITY. They\npretend to be very humble, but they are very revengeful. You can see around the world that the priests have done only one thing: they have created wars, religious wars they call crusades. They have killed many more people than anybody else, in the name of religion, in the name of love, in the name of truth. Their humbleness is hypocrisy. Their revengefulness is well known.\nFor thousands of years they have been destroying the unity of human beings. The whole humanity is one, but the priests will not allow it to happen; because if the whole humanity becomes one, drops these adjectives of being a Christian, or a Jew, or a Hindu or a Mohammedan, the priests will be at a loss. They have a very well paid profession and they are doing nothing, except creating trouble, riots amongst different religions.\nTHEY ARE BAD ENEMIES: NOTHING IS MORE REVENGEFUL THAN THEIR HUMILITY. AND\nHE WHO TOUCHES THEM IS EASILY DEFILED. Do not even touch them! Even coming in contact with them you will be defiled. They are the most ugly and disgusting profession on the earth.\nObviously, the people who sell God in the marketplaceOne day I was passing by the side of a\nchurch; a beautiful young woman waved to stop me, so I stopped the car. She handed over to me a few pamphlets. The first pamphlet on top had a beautiful house by the side of a mountain river with a waterfall, with huge trees and it said: “Do you want this house?”\nI could not believe that this house was available in that city. There were no mountains, there were no waterfalls, but perhaps I didn’t know. So I looked inside: it was not on the earth, it was in heaven. “Believe in Jesus Christ and you will have such beautiful houses, just by the side of God.” These\npeople are even selling properties in paradise, and so cheap – just believe in God, just believe in Jesus Christ, that’s enough.\nHE WHOM THEY CALL REDEEMER HAS CAST THEM INTO BONDAGE. All the redeemers have\ncreated different kinds of bondages. In fact nobody can redeem anybody else. One can redeem oneself, but to pretend that “I am the redeemer: just believe in me and I will save you; I am the savior, the only true savior,” has created imprisonments.\nThese imprisonments are spiritual and psychological, that’s why you don’t see them. Otherwise what do you mean, when you say, “I am a Christian,” or “I am a Hindu,” or “I am a Buddhist?” It means, that “I believe Gautam Buddha is going to be my redeemer”; that “I am waiting simply for Jesus Christ to come and redeem me.\n“You have dropped every effort to transform yourself – and that is the only way there is for any kind of transformation. All these redeemers have created only prisons for people. And the priests go on representing those dead redeemers.\nZarathustra is saying, HE WHOM THEY CALL REDEEMER HAS CAST THEM INTO BONDAGE.\nThese priests are also in bondage, but at least their bondage pays. The others who are in bondage are simply wasting their time in waiting. All waiting is waiting for Godot, who never comes.\nFive thousand years ago Krishna had promised the Hindus, “Whenever there will be misery, whenever there will be pain, whenever there will be anguish, whenever people will become unvirtuous – I will come to redeem you.”\nNow what more does he want?... The prisons are full of criminals; and those who are not in the prisons – it does not mean that they are not criminals, it simply means they have not been caught. People are living in utter misery, starvation, hunger, all kinds of sexual perversion.For what is he\nwaiting? He should come! He will not get a better chance to redeem people.\nJesus promised, “I will be coming.” They all have promised. Their promises have become chains on your souls. Because of their promises you have not made any effort to change your own being, which is far easier than to wait.\nINTO THE BONDAGE OF FALSE VALUES AND FALSE SCRIPTURES! I am really surprised, that almost the whole earth believes in different kinds of false scriptures. Their falsity is so clearly evident that it need not be proved.\nFor example, they all say, “God created the world”, and of course there was no witness. On what grounds are they so certain that God created the world? God has not left any inscription anywhere “I created the world.” the day, the month, the year. There is not a single witness. They all go on\npreaching about God, but not a single person has seen him. They go on talking about heaven and hell – not only talking, they have maps of heaven and hell. And they don’t have maps of the earth on which they live.\nI was visiting Agra. Agra has the most beautiful piece of architecture, the Taj Mahal. In Agra and the surrounding area there is a Hindu sect, Radhaswami. When their founder died, they decided to make something better than the Taj Mahal, because it was going to be in the same city, Agra. They have poured in enough money and for almost a hundred years thousands of stone-cutters have been working on it, and only the ground floor is ready. It does not seem that they will be able to make their whole dream come true, but even the ground floor shows that if they succeed, they will make the Taj Mahal number two. Their place will be number one – such great art, such a tremendous work of carving in marble.\nThe high priest took me inside their temple, and he showed me a map. They believe that there are fifteen heavens and fifteen hells. It seems mathematical. Somebody is just stealing a small thing, steals a button from your coat, now to throw him in with Adolf Hitler does not seem to be right. There must be some categorization. So it seems logical: fifteen hells for different kinds of sinners; the greatest sinners go to the fifteenth. The same is true about heavens. Somebody has done something good, he cannot be placed with Gautam Buddha or Jesus Christ, so according to their merit.…\nSo I looked. Seeing my interest in their map the high priest asked me, “What do you think about it?”\nI said, “It is perfectly right.” Although it is absolutely ugly, ugly in the sense that Mohammed is somewhere in the fourth heaven, Moses in the fifth, Jesus in the sixth; Gautam Buddha, Mahavira in the seventh; Kabir, Nanak in the eighth.That was the way they had divided it, with the names\nwritten, and their own guru, the founder of the Radhaswami sect, in the fifteenth. He was alone there. He had reached the highest consciousness. Gautam Buddha was still in the seventh, Jesus in the sixth.\nHe said, “What do you think about the categorization of these people?” I said, “That’s perfect; your guru is in the fifteenth.”\nHe looked at me. He said, “How are you certain?”\nI said, “I am certain, because I am in the sixteenth; and your guru is trying hard to enter into the sixteenth, but I won’t let him. I go on throwing him back into the fifteenth.” He said, “Sixteenth? But we have never heard about the sixteenth.”\nI said, “Your hearing or not hearing makes no difference.”\nHe said, “But you are insulting our guru.” I said, “I am not insulting him. Each according to his virtue; he reached only up to the fifteenth – and naturally I don’t want anybody else to share the sixteenth apartment. And there is nothing else above, so I cannot go higher. This is the highest peak and your guru has to remain in the fifteenth.”\nHe said, “I don’t believe you; you must be joking.”\nI said, “You are not joking? – putting Gautam Buddha in the seventh and your guru, who is not even the dust of Gautam Buddha’s feet, is in the fifteenth?”\nHe was very angry, but I said, “Anger will not help. All these falsitiesyou don’t have any evidence\nfor it. If you can produce any evidence, I will produce the evidence that I am in the sixteenth. Ask your guru, he knows me perfectly well.”\nBut all religious scriptures, theologies, are so full of lies. They have to be full of lies, because truth is very simple. It does not need a scripture, it needs a meditative awareness, it needs a silence within you – that is the only temple, all other temples are false.\nINTO THE BONDAGE OF FALSE VALUES AND FALSE SCRIPTURES! AH, THAT SOMEONE\nWOULD REDEEM THEM FROM THEIR REDEEMER! Zarathustra is saying, someone should redeem them from their redeemers. But say anything against any falsity and immediately you create enemies. I have not done any harm to anybody and I have created millions of enemies around the world – just because I pointed out the false statements in their scriptures, and they are not capable of defending them. Their failure to defend them becomes anger, rage, enmity.\nOH, JUST LOOK AT THESE HUTS THAT THESE PRIESTS HAVE BUILT THEMSELVES. CHURCHES THEY CALL THEIR SWEET-SMELLING CAVES!\nOH THIS COUNTERFEIT LIGHT! OH THIS MUSTY AIR! HERE, WHERE THE SOUL MAY NOT FLY UP TO ITS HEIGHT!\nON THE CONTRARY, THEIR FAITH COMMANDS: ‘UP THE STEPS ON YOUR KNEES, YOU SINNERS!’\nEvery religion destroys man’s dignity; calls him a sinner. Rather than endowing man with dignity, making him more beautiful and more truthful, making him a god on the earth, they have turned the whole of humanity into a crowd of sinners. All that you have to do is: “UP THE STEPS ON YOUR KNEES, YOU SINNERS!”\nThis they call worship, this they call prayer.\nThis is nothing but suicide, this is destroying yourself, your esteem in your own eyes, your self- respect, your dignity.\nYou are the highest evolution in existence. Existence has hoped and dreamt for you to bring even higher stages of consciousness. Existence dreams within you to become superman – but these priests have created supersinners.\nWHO CREATED SUCH CAVES AND PENITENTIAL STEPS? WAS IT NOT THOSE WHO WANTED TO HIDE THEMSELVES AND WERE ASHAMED BEFORE THE CLEAR SKY?\nWhat is the need of all these churches, and temples, and synagogues?\nIs not this whole world, the whole universe a beautiful temple? The sky full of stars in the night, the day full of the light of the sun, the birds singing, the flowers blossoming – what more beauty can you create? This spaciousness is your freedom. Being bound with false ideologies inside a church, you are nothing but a prisoner.\nAND ONLY WHEN THE CLEAR SKY AGAIN LOOKS THROUGH BROKEN ROOFS AND DOWN UPON GRASS AND RED POPPIES ON BROKEN WALLS – ONLY THEN WILL I TURN MY HEART AGAIN TOWARDS THE PLACES OF THIS GOD.\nZarathustra says, this whole universe is the temple of God. All that is living is nothing but divine. Everything is sacred, nothing is profane. The duality is created by the priests, and the duality between the profane and the sacred has created a duality within you – between the body and the soul. It has created a schizophrenic humanity – everybody is split.\nUnless you become one, a deep harmony and accord, you will never hear the celestial music, which is the only proof that the world is not bad, that the world is alive: not only alive, but conscious; not only conscious, but constantly creative.\nChristians say God created this world in six days; and the seventh day, on Sunday, he rested – and he is still resting, his Monday has not come yet. This world, this vast universe which has no limits is a continuous process of creativity; it is still being created. Who says the creation was complete in six days? And why should it be complete in six days? Nothing seems to be complete, everything is growing. Man’s intelligence is growing, his consciousness is growing.\nIn those six days God did not create Zarathustra, God did not create Gautam Buddha, God did not create Jesus Christ. These are higher evolutionary steps. Zarathustra says you are only a bridge for the superman to arrive. You are not a being, but only a becoming. It seems to be so rational, so authentically true that man is a becoming. Anything that has become perfect becomes dead, because there is no possibility of any growth. It has exhausted itself; it has spent itself completely.\nLife has to remain becoming, not being. It has to go on progressing, touching skies after skies, peaks beyond peaks.\nTHEY CALLED GOD THAT WHICH CONTRADICTED AND HARMED THEM: AND TRULY, THERE WAS MUCH THAT WAS HEROIC IN THEIR WORSHIP!\nZarathustra has a very subtle sense of humor, which to me is part of a really religious man. A really religious man is not serious, he is playful; and he has a tremendous quality of humor. He is saying, THEY CALLED GOD THAT WHICH CONTRADICTED AND HARMED THEM. If God was the creator\nof the world, then why is there so much misery? Then why are people dying of starvation? Has God forgotten about the universe He has created?\nIf God created the universe, then He is responsible for it; for all the sinners, for all the criminals, because He created the seeds of crime and the seeds of sin; otherwise, from where did they come? – He is the only creator.\nIf a man murders somebody, who creates the desire for murder? If a man rapes somebody, who creates the desire for rape? If God is the only creator, then Zarathustra is right: THEY CALLED GOD THAT WHICH CONTRADICTED AND HARMED THEMand goes on contradicting and harming\nthem. Then who is responsible for nuclear weapons? Who was responsible for Adolf Hitler and the second world war? Who was responsible for fifty million people’s deaths in the second world war? And who will be responsible if the Third World War happens and all life is destroyed on this beautiful planet?\nGod has to take the responsibility. If he is the creator, then he has to be the destroyer too, that implication is clear.\nTRULY, THERE WAS MUCH THAT WAS HEROIC IN THEIR WORSHIP. And still the idiots are\nworshiping God – they are really heroic! THERE WAS MUCH THAT WAS HEROIC IN THEIR WORSHIP, to worship such a God who prevents his own creation, Adam and Eve, from becoming wise, from becoming eternally alive. Still the priests go on worshiping him and people go on blindly following the priest. He is simply laughing at their stupidity.\nAND THEY KNEW NO OTHER WAY OF LOVING THEIR GOD THAN BY NAILING MEN TO THE\nCROSS! In the name of God more men have been killed than in any other name. Strange God, strange creator; strange are his representatives whose whole work is to kill man, to destroy man. Strange are these so-called religious priests whose whole teaching is to renounce the world – and God created the world. Can’t you see the contradiction? If God creates the world, then to renounce the world means renouncing God.\nGeorge Gurdjieff used to say that all religions are against God. He was also joking; he was saying they are against God because they all teach, “Renounce the world.” Poor God has created the world\nin six days and got so tired that still his Monday has not come. He has not been seen around again. Perhaps he spent himself totally and was finished; Sunday he went to sleep and never woke up again. And these people go on teaching “Renounce the world.” Renouncing the world is renouncing God, because it is his creation.\nTHEY WOULD HAVE TO SING BETTER SONGS TO MAKE ME BELIEVE IN THEIR REDEEMER:\nHIS DISCIPLES WOULD HAVE TO LOOK MORE REDEEMED! They don’t look redeemed. You just look at the disciples of the so-called religions. Go and see the Jaina monks! Their eyes will not show intelligence, their faces will not shine with light and glory. They are torturing themselves, that is their discipline. And if you torture yourself, you cannot be a beautiful flower.\nAll the religions... looking at the pope, do you feel that he has anything of the divine, any aura of the divine? The pope who preceeded him was a homosexual. Is homosexuality divine? Perhaps, because the Christian trinity also seems to be a gay group: God the father, God the son, and a strange fellow, the Holy Ghost – not a single woman.\nThe popes down the ages have burnt thousands of women alive, condemning them as witches. What was the criterion for them to decide who was a witch? Now there are no witches at all; suddenly they appeared, and suddenly they disappeared. There was no criterion, any man could inform the pope.\nThe pope had appointed a special court. Just the suspicion that a certain woman seems to be a witch... any man was eligible to suspect her.\nNo reason was asked, the woman was immediately caught and tortured so much for days on end, kept hungry, thirsty... beating her. They had invented machines for torture, and finally, because that seemed to be the only way to get rid of the torture, she had to confess that she was a witch. Her confession was the only criterion; and a confession you can get from anybody, if you torture enough and there is no way out. They dictated to her what she had to tell the court: that she was a witch and she had a sexual relationship with the devil.\nThe devil does not exist, but the woman had to say it in the court; otherwise the torture would start again. Once she accepted in the court that she was a witch and she had a sexual relationship with the devil, then the court was satisfied. There was no need of any other evidence. The judgement was simple: the woman had to be burnt alive in the middle of the town, so everybody could see what happened if you had a sexual relationship with the devil. Thousands of women were simply burnt, and these popes were responsible for it. These popes don’t show any joy, any blissfulness, any creativity, any silence. Yes, they go on doing stupid things: kissing the earth. When this Polack pope came here, on Delhi airport he kissed the earth. I said, “This is his first taste of the Hindu religion, because here the whole earth is full of cowdung, holy cowdung.” But by kissing the earth you simply show your stupidity and nothing else.\nZarathustra is saying, THEY WOULD HAVE TO SING BETTER SONGS TO MAKE ME BELIEVE\nIN THEIR REDEEMER.They have to show that they are redeemed, that they are awakened, that\nthey are liberated.HIS DISCIPLES WOULD HAVE TO LOOK MORE REDEEMED! But that is\nnot the case: they look more and more enslaved.\nI SHOULD LIKE TO SEE THEM NAKED: FOR BEAUTY ALONE SHOULD PREACH PENITENCE.\nWhy should they hide themselves? They should come out naked, in the open; they have nothing to hide. But do you think this Polack, if he comes naked, will look beautiful? He will look like a cartoon, of course not made by a great artist, just some amateur cartoonist.\nTHE SPIRIT OF THEIR REDEEMERS CONSISTED OF HOLES; BUT INTO EVERY HOLE THEY HAD PUT THEIR ILLUSION, THEIR STOP-GAP, WHICH THEY CALLED GOD.\nIf one looks with a magnifying glass at the life of Jesus, or the life of Gautam Buddha, or the life of Mahavira, or any other religious founder, one will find many holes in him, because nobody is perfect. They have filled those holes with illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.\nI have heard that in paradise Moses and Jesus, both had gone fishing. Jesus asked Moses, “Is it really true that you parted the ocean and made a way for your people?”\nMoses said, “As far as I remember, it is true.” Jesus said, “Can you do it again?”\nMoses said, “I am not certain, but I will try.”\nHe tried and he parted the lake into two parts. Old Jesus was amazed and he said, “Your memory is great!”\nMoses asked, “What about you! You used to walk on water I have heard. Can you do that now?” Jesus said, “I can try. I used to, that much I remember.”\nSo he got out of the boat and started drowning.\nMoses had to pull him back in. He said, “What happened, my son?” He said, “I forgot one thing: that time I had no holes in my feet.”\nThey all have holes, and the work of their priests is to go on filling those holes with good stories, fictions, mythologies, all kinds of lies, miracles.\nZEALOUSLY AND WITH CLAMOR THEY DROVE THEIR HERDS OVER THEIR BRIDGE: AS\nIF THERE WERE ONLY ONE BRIDGE TO THE FUTURE! This is where Zarathustra cannot be categorized with any other mystic. He is saying there are many bridges to the future. Life is multi- dimensional.\nTRULY, THESE SHEPHERDS, TOO, STILL BELONGED AMONG THE SHEEP! They are\npretenders. They call themselves shepherds, but they belong to the same crowd as the sheep, because they are not aware of a simple fact: that to the future there are many bridges. Man has so many potentialities. He can become so many different kinds of superman. And we will need in the world every superman to be unique, so that the variety, and the beauty that variety brings, remains alive on the earth. If everybody becomes just the same, life will become a boredom.\nTHEY WROTE LETTERS OF BLOOD ON THE PATH THEY FOLLOWED, AND THEIR FOLLY TAUGHT THAT TRUTH IS PROVED BY BLOOD.\nBUT BLOOD IS THE WORST WITNESS OF TRUTH; BLOOD POISONS AND TRANSFORMS THE PUREST TEACHING TO DELUSION AND HATRED OF THE HEART.\nBut for thousands of years blood has been the only argument. Whoever can cut your head with a sword has proved that his religion is right. The sword cannot be an argument, but it has been the argument for thousands of years. This shows how the priests have stopped man’s growth, hindered in every way his flights into the open sky – they have not allowed freedom.\nAND YOU, MY BROTHERS, MUST BE REDEEMED BY GREATER MEN THAN ANY REDEEMER HAS BEEN, IF YOU WOULD FIND THE WAY TO FREEDOM!\nAll that you need is to find a way to total freedom, freedom from all kinds of psychological and spiritual bondage, and you yourself will become your own redeemer. You will be a far superior man than all your redeemers have been.\n... THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA.\nOkay, Maneesha?\nYes, Osho.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"6737","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/zarathustra_a_god_that_can_dance/part22/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/zarathustra_a_god_that_can_dance/>Zarathustra.

REDEEMER HAS BEEN, IF YOU WOULD FIND THE WAY TO FREEDOM!</p><p><br></p><p>... THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA.</p><p><br></p><p>AN ANCIENT STORY: A young devil comes running to his boss. He is
trembling, and he says to the old devil, “Something has to be done
immediately, because on the earth one man has found the truth! And once
people know the truth, what will happen to our profession?”</p><p><br></p><p>The old man laughed, and he said, “Sit down and rest and don’t be
worried. Everything is taken care of. Our people have reached
there.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But,” he said, “I am coming from there. I have not seen a single
devil there.”</p><p>The old man said, “The priests are my people. They have already
surrounded the man who has found the truth. Now they will become the
mediators between the man of truth and the masses. They will raise
temples, they will write scriptures, they will interpret and distort
everything. They will ask people to worship, to pray. And in all this
hubbub, the truth will be lost. This is my old method, which has always
succeeded.”</p><p><br></p><p>The priests who represent religion are not its friends. They are the
greatest enemies of it, because religion needs no mediators: between you
and existence there is an immediate relatedness. All that you have to
learn is how to understand the language of existence. You know the
languages of man, but they are not the languages of existence.</p><p><br></p><p>Existence knows only one language:</p><p><br></p><p>And that is of silence.</p><p><br></p><p>If you can also be silent you will be able to understand the truth,
the meaning of life, the significance of all that exists. And there is
no one who can interpret it for you. Everyone has to find it for
himself. Nobody can do the job on your behalf – but that’s what the
priests have been doing for centuries. They are standing like a China
Wall between you and existence.</p><p><br></p><p>Just a few days ago, the Vatican pope informed all the Catholics, “It
is being told again and again to me that many Catholics are confessing
to God directly. They are not going to the confession booth, to the
priest. I declare it a sin to confess directly to God. You have to
confess to the priest; you cannot relate to God directly.”</p><p><br></p><p>He has not given any reason, because there is no reason at all,
except that the priest has to be kept in his profession – and he himself
is a high priest.</p><p><br></p><p>If people start approaching reality without anybody leading them,
without anybody telling them what is good and what is evil, without
anybody giving them a map that they have to follow, millions of people
will be able to understand existence – because our heartbeat is also the
heartbeat of the universe, our life is part of the life of the
total.</p><p><br></p><p>We are not strangers, we are not coming from somewhere else; we are
growing within existence. We are part of it, an essential part of it. We
just have to be silent enough, so that we can hear that which cannot be
said in words: the music of existence, the immense joy of existence, the
constant celebration of existence. Once it starts penetrating our heart,
transformation comes.</p><p><br></p><p>That is the only way somebody becomes religious – not by going to the
churches which are made by man, not by reading the scriptures which are
made by man. But the priests have been pretending that their holy
scriptures are written by God. The very idea is simply idiotic. Just
look into those scriptures: You will not find any signature of God in
them. You will find things which there is no reason for God to
write.</p><p><br></p><p>Hindus believe in the VEDAS and believe that they are written by God
himself, and they are the most ancient books in existence; but no Hindu
bothers to look into them. If God wrote them, there is going to be
something immensely valuable... but ninety-eight percent of the VEDAS
are just rubbish – such rubbish that it proves that they are not written
by God.</p><p>For example a prayer by a priest... why should God write it? And the
prayer is that his cows are not giving enough milk, “Have mercy on me,
increase the milk of my cows.” Not only that, “Decrease the milk of
everybody else’s!” – God is going to write this? “Kill my enemies and
help my friends” and even such stupid things as “Rains are coming; take
care that all the water reaches my fields and avoids the neighboring
field, because it belongs to my enemy. Just shower your water on my
field.”</p><p><br></p><p>Why should God write these things? Every scripture gives intrinsic
evidence that they are written by men, and very stupid men, primitive
men. The so-called holy scriptures are not even to be counted as good
literature – they are childish, crude, ugly. But because they are
written in languages which are dead... and some are in languages which
have never been in use by common people, for example, the VEDAS. That
language has never been used by the common people. It was the language
of the learned brahmins, the language of the priests.</p><p><br></p><p>And they were very reluctant that it should be translated, because
they knew: once it is translated, it will lose all sanctity. People will
see that this nonsense is not even unholy – what to say about its being
holy!</p><p><br></p><p>So much obscenity, so much pornography is in the holy scriptures of
all your religions. But they are written in Sanskrit, which is not used
by common people; in Arabic, which is not used by common people; in
Hebrew, which is not used by common people; in Pali, in Prakrit. Those
languages are dead. And all the religions are reluctant that their holy
scriptures should be brought in to the modern languages which people
understand – although, in spite of their reluctance, their holy
scriptures have been translated.</p><p><br></p><p>First they were against their being printed; second they were against
their being translated. The only reason was, they knew that once they
were printed they would be sold all over the world, anybody could
purchase them. And if they are translated into living languages, then
how long can you hide the truth?, and how are you going to prove that
they are written by God?</p><p><br></p><p>The scriptures are man-made, the statues of God are man-made, the
temples and churches are man-made, but thousands of years of
conditioning has given them a certain sacredness, holiness. And there is
nothing sacred in them, nothing holy in them.</p><p><br></p><p>The priests have been deceiving man more than anybody else. This is
the worst profession in the world, even worse than the profession of the
prostitutes. At least the prostitute gives you something in return; the
priest gives you simply hot air – he has nothing to give to you.</p><p><br></p><p>And this is not all: Whenever somebody has realized the truth, these
priests are against him. Obviously they have to be, because if his truth
is recognized by people, millions of priests in the world will be out of
employment. And their employment is absolutely unproductive. They are
parasites, they go on sucking the blood of man. From the moment the
child is born, until he enters his grave, the priest goes on finding
ways to exploit him.</p><p><br></p><p>Unless religion is freed from the hands of the priests, the world
will remain only with pseudo-religion; it will never become religious.
And a religious world can not be so miserable: the religious world
should be a constant celebration.</p><p><br></p><p>A religious man is nothing but pure ecstasy. His heart is full of
songs.</p><p>His whole being is ready to dance any moment.</p><p><br></p><p>But the priest has taken away the search for truth: He says there is
no need for searching, it has already been found, you just have to have
faith.</p><p><br></p><p>The priest has made people miserable, because he condemns all the
pleasures of the world. He condemns the pleasures of the world so that
he can praise the pleasures of the other world.</p><p><br></p><p>The other world is his fiction. And he wants humanity to sacrifice
its reality for a fictitious idea – and people have sacrificed.</p><p><br></p><p>Zarathustra is not alone in condemning the priests. Gautam Buddha is
with him, Mahavira is with him, Lao Tzu is with him. Gautam Buddha,
Mahavira, and Lao Tzu condemn the priests, but very mildly. Zarathustra
calls a spade a spade. He is absolutely realistic. He does not care
about etiquette, manners, culture. He says whatsoever he experiences as
the truth.</p><p><br></p><p>AND ONE DAY ZARATHUSTRA MADE A SIGN TO HIS DISCIPLES AND SPOKE THESE
WORDS TO THEM:</p><p><br></p><p>HERE ARE PRIESTS: AND ALTHOUGH THEY ARE MY ENEMIES, PASS THEM BY
QUIETLY</p><p>AND WITH SLEEPING SWORDS! Zarathustra is very simple, innocent;
speaks like a child. Gautam Buddha will not call them “my enemies,” he
will go round about.</p><p><br></p><p>Zarathustra hates directly.</p><p><br></p><p>The priests are not only enemies of Zarathustra, they are enemies of
everyone who loves truth, who is in search of truth or who has found the
truth. The closer you are to the truth, the more the priest is your
enemy. You are disturbing his customers, you are disturbing his
business. Religion to him is business.</p><p><br></p><p>The Christian churches in America were against me for the simple
reason that so many young men and women have come out of their fold. My
people don’t belong to any religion. They are religious, and for being
religious you don’t have to belong to any religion.</p><p><br></p><p>Religiousness is a quality, a fragrance of your consciousness. It has
nothing to do with belonging to an organization, following fixed and
dead principles, decided by people who have been long, long dead. To
look at it differently, in the name of religion the dead are dominating
the living: they are dictating to you how you should live. They don’t
know anything about the vast changes that have happened since they
died.</p><p><br></p><p>We are living in a totally different world, in a totally different
time and we need every day a spontaneous awareness to respond to
reality. And we go on failing because our response is not spontaneous:
the reality is new and our response is thousands of years old. Our
failure is absolutely certain and that constant failure brings misery in
life.</p><p><br></p><p>HERE ARE PRIESTS, says Zarathustra to his disciples, AND ALTHOUGH
THEY ARE MY ENEMIES, PASS THEM BY QUIETLY, don’t quarrel with them. They
are very efficient in quarreling.</p><p>They have refined their arguments. They don’t have anything else to
do, they only argue. It is better, to PASS THEM BY QUIETLY AND WITH
SLEEPING SWORDS.</p><p>Don’t fight with them. Because you are new, you have not yet
experienced the truth – that is the problem. They can disturb you, they
can lead you astray. You don’t know the truth, nor do they know the
truth, but they know the arguments, sophistry. They can convince your
minds for anything they want. All priests belong to the category of the
sophists.</p><p>One of my vice-chancellors was a world-renowned law-expert. He had
three offices: one in London, one in New Delhi, one in Peking, and he
was running continually from Peking to Delhi, from Delhi to London. He
had the biggest cases on his hands – of maharajas, kings, queens – but
he was a drunkard. He earned enough money; and when he retired, he
donated the whole of the money so that a university could be founded. So
he was the founder vice-chancellor of the university that he
created.</p><p>I used to go for a morning walk, and he was the only one whom I used
to meet on my morning walks. By and by we became very friendly and very
close. One day I was talking about sophistry, and he remembered one of
his cases that he had fought in the Privy Council, in London. The case
was between the Maharaja of Jaipur and the Maharaja of Udaipur. It was a
big case but the night before he drank too much, and in the morning
there was still the hang-over.</p><p>He went to the court. In his drunkenness he forgot completely that he
was fighting for the Maharaja of Jaipur. Everybody was astonished
because e started criticizing the Maharaja of Jaipur. He gave great
arguments, brought all the precedents, all the legal support. Even the
judges were looking at each other: What had happened to this man? – he
was supposed to fight for the Maharaja of Jaipur. The man who was going
to fight for the Maharaja of Udaipur could not believe what is
happening: Now what is he going to do?</p><p>He was so convincing, that at lunch-time, when the court dissolved,
his secretary said, “What are you doing? Are you fighting for the
Maharaja of Jaipur or for the Maharaja of Udaipur?”</p><p>He said, “I drank too much last night. I do not know for whom I am
fighting, for what I am fighting, but I had to say something. Do you
think I was on the wrong side?”</p><p>The secretary said, “Absolutely wrong – and you have convinced the
judges. Even the advocate who is going to argue against you, feels
completely lost, because you have done his job already.”</p><p>He said, “Do not be worried. So I am for the Maharaja of Jaipur. Just
you remain standing by my side and go on pulling my coat, so I don’t
forget again. I am still not absolutely out of the influence of the
alcohol: I look at the judge and I see two judges and I know – that is
my criterion.”</p><p>In the second half, after lunch, he said to the judge, “Before lunch
I spoke in favour of the Maharaja of Udaipur and against the Maharaja of
Jaipur. That was only half my argument. I was preparing the ground.
These are the arguments that can be given by the opposing advocate. Now
I will begin to destroy all those arguments, because I am here to
protect the Maharaja of Jaipur and his interests.”</p><p>This was a new revelation to everybody and even the judge could not
believe that he would be able to contradict what he had established so
clearly. But he contradicted it. Now he argued against himself and he
won the case.</p><p>So he was telling me that sophistry is a prostitute. Arguments don’t
prove anything: A little better argumentation and they can be
demolished. If you don’t have the experience, it is dangerous to get
into a quarrel, into argumentation, into sophistry, because your mind,
having no experience, can be convinced by arguments for something which
is not true.</p><p>The advice of Zarathustra is: first have the experience – then there
is no need to be afraid of any argument, because no argument can destroy
your experience. Your experience has a quality of being self
evident.</p><p>THEY ARE BAD ENEMIES: NOTHING IS MORE REVENGEFUL THAN THEIR HUMILITY.
They</p><p>pretend to be very humble, but they are very revengeful. You can see
around the world that the priests have done only one thing: they have
created wars, religious wars they call crusades. They have killed many
more people than anybody else, in the name of religion, in the name of
love, in the name of truth. Their humbleness is hypocrisy. Their
revengefulness is well known.</p><p>For thousands of years they have been destroying the unity of human
beings. The whole humanity is one, but the priests will not allow it to
happen; because if the whole humanity becomes one, drops these
adjectives of being a Christian, or a Jew, or a Hindu or a Mohammedan,
the priests will be at a loss. They have a very well paid profession and
they are doing nothing, except creating trouble, riots amongst different
religions.</p><p>THEY ARE BAD ENEMIES: NOTHING IS MORE REVENGEFUL THAN THEIR HUMILITY.
AND</p><p>HE WHO TOUCHES THEM IS EASILY DEFILED. Do not even touch them! Even
coming in contact with them you will be defiled. They are the most ugly
and disgusting profession on the earth.</p><p>Obviously, the people who sell God in the marketplace<span class=s4></span>One day I was passing by the side of a</p><p>church; a beautiful young woman waved to stop me, so I stopped the
car. She handed over to me a few pamphlets. The first pamphlet on top
had a beautiful house by the side of a mountain river with a waterfall,
with huge trees and it said: “Do you want this house?”</p><p>I could not believe that this house was available in that city. There
were no mountains, there were no waterfalls, but perhaps I didn’t know.
So I looked inside: it was not on the earth, it was in heaven. “Believe
in Jesus Christ and you will have such beautiful houses, just by the
side of God.<span class=s4></span>” These</p><p>people are even selling properties in paradise, and so cheap – just
believe in God, just believe in Jesus Christ, that’s enough.</p><p>HE WHOM THEY CALL REDEEMER HAS CAST THEM INTO BONDAGE. All the
redeemers have</p><p>created different kinds of bondages. In fact nobody can redeem
anybody else. One can redeem oneself, but to pretend that “I am the
redeemer: just believe in me and I will save you; I am the savior, the
only true savior,” has created imprisonments.</p><p>These imprisonments are spiritual and psychological, that’s why you
don’t see them. Otherwise what do you mean, when you say, “I am a
Christian,” or “I am a Hindu,” or “I am a Buddhist?” It means, that “I
believe Gautam Buddha is going to be my redeemer”; that “I am waiting
simply for Jesus Christ to come and redeem me.</p><p>“You have dropped every effort to transform yourself – and that is
the only way there is for any kind of transformation. All these
redeemers have created only prisons for people. And the priests go on
representing those dead redeemers.</p><p>Zarathustra is saying, HE WHOM THEY CALL REDEEMER HAS CAST THEM INTO
BONDAGE.</p><p>These priests are also in bondage, but at least their bondage pays.
The others who are in bondage are simply wasting their time in waiting.
All waiting is waiting for Godot, who never comes.</p><p><br></p><p>Five thousand years ago Krishna had promised the Hindus, “Whenever
there will be misery, whenever there will be pain, whenever there will
be anguish, whenever people will become unvirtuous – I will come to
redeem you.”</p><p><br></p><p>Now what more does he want?... The prisons are full of criminals; and
those who are not in the prisons – it does not mean that they are not
criminals, it simply means they have not been caught. People are living
in utter misery, starvation, hunger, all kinds of sexual
perversion.<span class=s4></span>For what is he</p><p>waiting? He should come! He will not get a better chance to redeem
people.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus promised, “I will be coming.” They all have promised. Their
promises have become chains on your souls. Because of their promises you
have not made any effort to change your own being, which is far easier
than to wait.</p><p><br></p><p>INTO THE BONDAGE OF FALSE VALUES AND FALSE SCRIPTURES! I am really
surprised, that almost the whole earth believes in different kinds of
false scriptures. Their falsity is so clearly evident that it need not
be proved.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, they all say, “God created the world”, and of course
there was no witness. On what grounds are they so certain that God
created the world? God has not left any inscription anywhere “I created
the world.<span class=s4></span>” the day, the month, the year. There
is not a single witness. They all go on</p><p>preaching about God, but not a single person has seen him. They go on
talking about heaven and hell – not only talking, they have maps of
heaven and hell. And they don’t have maps of the earth on which they
live.</p><p><br></p><p>I was visiting Agra. Agra has the most beautiful piece of
architecture, the Taj Mahal. In Agra and the surrounding area there is a
Hindu sect, Radhaswami. When their founder died, they decided to make
something better than the Taj Mahal, because it was going to be in the
same city, Agra. They have poured in enough money and for almost a
hundred years thousands of stone-cutters have been working on it, and
only the ground floor is ready. It does not seem that they will be able
to make their whole dream come true, but even the ground floor shows
that if they succeed, they will make the Taj Mahal number two. Their
place will be number one – such great art, such a tremendous work of
carving in marble.</p><p><br></p><p>The high priest took me inside their temple, and he showed me a map.
They believe that there are fifteen heavens and fifteen hells. It seems
mathematical. Somebody is just stealing a small thing, steals a button
from your coat, now to throw him in with Adolf Hitler does not seem to
be right. There must be some categorization. So it seems logical:
fifteen hells for different kinds of sinners; the greatest sinners go to
the fifteenth. The same is true about heavens. Somebody has done
something good, he cannot be placed with Gautam Buddha or Jesus Christ,
so according to their merit.…</p><p><br></p><p>So I looked. Seeing my interest in their map the high priest asked
me, “What do you think about it?”</p><p>I said, “It is perfectly right.” Although it is absolutely ugly, ugly
in the sense that Mohammed is somewhere in the fourth heaven, Moses in
the fifth, Jesus in the sixth; Gautam Buddha, Mahavira in the seventh;
Kabir, Nanak in the eighth.<span class=s4></span>That was the way they
had divided it, with the names</p><p>written, and their own guru, the founder of the Radhaswami sect, in
the fifteenth. He was alone there. He had reached the highest
consciousness. Gautam Buddha was still in the seventh, Jesus in the
sixth.</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “What do you think about the categorization of these
people?” I said, “That’s perfect; your guru is in the fifteenth.”</p><p>He looked at me. He said, “How are you certain?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I am certain, because I am in the sixteenth; and your guru
is trying hard to enter into the sixteenth, but I won’t let him. I go on
throwing him back into the fifteenth.” He said, “Sixteenth? But we have
never heard about the sixteenth.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Your hearing or not hearing makes no difference.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “But you are insulting our guru.” I said, “I am not
insulting him. Each according to his virtue; he reached only up to the
fifteenth – and naturally I don’t want anybody else to share the
sixteenth apartment. And there is nothing else above, so I cannot go
higher. This is the highest peak and your guru has to remain in the
fifteenth.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I don’t believe you; you must be joking.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “You are not joking? – putting Gautam Buddha in the seventh
and your guru, who is not even the dust of Gautam Buddha’s feet, is in
the fifteenth?”</p><p><br></p><p>He was very angry, but I said, “Anger will not help. All these
falsities<span class=s4></span>you don’t have any evidence</p><p>for it. If you can produce any evidence, I will produce the evidence
that I am in the sixteenth. Ask your guru, he knows me perfectly
well.”</p><p><br></p><p>But all religious scriptures, theologies, are so full of lies. They
have to be full of lies, because truth is very simple. It does not need
a scripture, it needs a meditative awareness, it needs a silence within
you – that is the only temple, all other temples are false.</p><p><br></p><p>INTO THE BONDAGE OF FALSE VALUES AND FALSE SCRIPTURES! AH, THAT
SOMEONE</p><p>WOULD REDEEM THEM FROM THEIR REDEEMER! Zarathustra is saying, someone
should redeem them from their redeemers. But say anything against any
falsity and immediately you create enemies. I have not done any harm to
anybody and I have created millions of enemies around the world – just
because I pointed out the false statements in their scriptures, and they
are not capable of defending them. Their failure to defend them becomes
anger, rage, enmity.</p><p><br></p><p>OH, JUST LOOK AT THESE HUTS THAT THESE PRIESTS HAVE BUILT THEMSELVES.
CHURCHES THEY CALL THEIR SWEET-SMELLING CAVES!</p><p>OH THIS COUNTERFEIT LIGHT! OH THIS MUSTY AIR! HERE, WHERE THE SOUL
MAY NOT FLY UP TO ITS HEIGHT!</p><p><br></p><p>ON THE CONTRARY, THEIR FAITH COMMANDS: ‘UP THE STEPS ON YOUR KNEES,
YOU SINNERS!’</p><p><br></p><p>Every religion destroys man’s dignity; calls him a sinner. Rather
than endowing man with dignity, making him more beautiful and more
truthful, making him a god on the earth, they have turned the whole of
humanity into a crowd of sinners. All that you have to do is: “UP THE
STEPS ON YOUR KNEES, YOU SINNERS!”</p><p><br></p><p>This they call worship, this they call prayer.</p><p><br></p><p>This is nothing but suicide, this is destroying yourself, your esteem
in your own eyes, your self- respect, your dignity.</p><p><br></p><p>You are the highest evolution in existence. Existence has hoped and
dreamt for you to bring even higher stages of consciousness. Existence
dreams within you to become superman – but these priests have created
supersinners.</p><p><br></p><p>WHO CREATED SUCH CAVES AND PENITENTIAL STEPS? WAS IT NOT THOSE WHO
WANTED TO HIDE THEMSELVES AND WERE ASHAMED BEFORE THE CLEAR SKY?</p><p><br></p><p>What is the need of all these churches, and temples, and
synagogues?</p><p><br></p><p>Is not this whole world, the whole universe a beautiful temple? The
sky full of stars in the night, the day full of the light of the sun,
the birds singing, the flowers blossoming – what more beauty can you
create? This spaciousness is your freedom. Being bound with false
ideologies inside a church, you are nothing but a prisoner.</p><p><br></p><p>AND ONLY WHEN THE CLEAR SKY AGAIN LOOKS THROUGH BROKEN ROOFS AND DOWN
UPON GRASS AND RED POPPIES ON BROKEN WALLS – ONLY THEN WILL I TURN MY
HEART AGAIN TOWARDS THE PLACES OF THIS GOD.</p><p><br></p><p>Zarathustra says, this whole universe is the temple of God. All that
is living is nothing but divine. Everything is sacred, nothing is
profane. The duality is created by the priests, and the duality between
the profane and the sacred has created a duality within you – between
the body and the soul. It has created a schizophrenic humanity –
everybody is split.</p><p><br></p><p>Unless you become one, a deep harmony and accord, you will never hear
the celestial music, which is the only proof that the world is not bad,
that the world is alive: not only alive, but conscious; not only
conscious, but constantly creative.</p><p><br></p><p>Christians say God created this world in six days; and the seventh
day, on Sunday, he rested – and he is still resting, his Monday has not
come yet. This world, this vast universe which has no limits is a
continuous process of creativity; it is still being created. Who says
the creation was complete in six days? And why should it be complete in
six days? Nothing seems to be complete, everything is growing. Man’s
intelligence is growing, his consciousness is growing.</p><p>In those six days God did not create Zarathustra, God did not create
Gautam Buddha, God did not create Jesus Christ. These are higher
evolutionary steps. Zarathustra says you are only a bridge for the
superman to arrive. You are not a being, but only a becoming. It seems
to be so rational, so authentically true that man is a becoming.
Anything that has become perfect becomes dead, because there is no
possibility of any growth. It has exhausted itself; it has spent itself
completely.</p><p><br></p><p>Life has to remain becoming, not being. It has to go on progressing,
touching skies after skies, peaks beyond peaks.</p><p><br></p><p>THEY CALLED GOD THAT WHICH CONTRADICTED AND HARMED THEM: AND TRULY,
THERE WAS MUCH THAT WAS HEROIC IN THEIR WORSHIP!</p><p><br></p><p>Zarathustra has a very subtle sense of humor, which to me is part of
a really religious man. A really religious man is not serious, he is
playful; and he has a tremendous quality of humor. He is saying, THEY
CALLED GOD THAT WHICH CONTRADICTED AND HARMED THEM. If God was the
creator</p><p>of the world, then why is there so much misery? Then why are people
dying of starvation? Has God forgotten about the universe He has
created?</p><p><br></p><p>If God created the universe, then He is responsible for it; for all
the sinners, for all the criminals, because He created the seeds of
crime and the seeds of sin; otherwise, from where did they come? – He is
the only creator.</p><p><br></p><p>If a man murders somebody, who creates the desire for murder? If a
man rapes somebody, who creates the desire for rape? If God is the only
creator, then Zarathustra is right: THEY CALLED GOD THAT WHICH
CONTRADICTED AND HARMED THEM<span class=s4></span>and goes on
contradicting and harming</p><p>them. Then who is responsible for nuclear weapons? Who was
responsible for Adolf Hitler and the second world war? Who was
responsible for fifty million people’s deaths in the second world war?
And who will be responsible if the Third World War happens and all life
is destroyed on this beautiful planet?</p><p><br></p><p>God has to take the responsibility. If he is the creator, then he has
to be the destroyer too, that implication is clear.</p><p><br></p><p>TRULY, THERE WAS MUCH THAT WAS HEROIC IN THEIR WORSHIP. And still the
idiots are</p><p>worshiping God – they are really heroic! THERE WAS MUCH THAT WAS
HEROIC IN THEIR WORSHIP, to worship such a God who prevents his own
creation, Adam and Eve, from becoming wise, from becoming eternally
alive. Still the priests go on worshiping him and people go on blindly
following the priest. He is simply laughing at their stupidity.</p><p><br></p><p>AND THEY KNEW NO OTHER WAY OF LOVING THEIR GOD THAN BY NAILING MEN TO
THE</p><p>CROSS! In the name of God more men have been killed than in any other
name. Strange God, strange creator; strange are his representatives
whose whole work is to kill man, to destroy man. Strange are these
so-called religious priests whose whole teaching is to renounce the
world – and God created the world. Can’t you see the contradiction? If
God creates the world, then to renounce the world means renouncing
God.</p><p><br></p><p>George Gurdjieff used to say that all religions are against God. He
was also joking; he was saying they are against God because they all
teach, “Renounce the world.” Poor God has created the world</p><p>in six days and got so tired that still his Monday has not come. He
has not been seen around again. Perhaps he spent himself totally and was
finished; Sunday he went to sleep and never woke up again. And these
people go on teaching “Renounce the world.” Renouncing the world is
renouncing God, because it is his creation.</p><p><br></p><p>THEY WOULD HAVE TO SING BETTER SONGS TO MAKE ME BELIEVE IN THEIR
REDEEMER:</p><p>HIS DISCIPLES WOULD HAVE TO LOOK MORE REDEEMED! They don’t look
redeemed. You just look at the disciples of the so-called religions. Go
and see the Jaina monks! Their eyes will not show intelligence, their
faces will not shine with light and glory. They are torturing
themselves, that is their discipline. And if you torture yourself, you
cannot be a beautiful flower.</p><p><br></p><p>All the religions... looking at the pope, do you feel that he has
anything of the divine, any aura of the divine? The pope who preceeded
him was a homosexual. Is homosexuality divine? Perhaps, because the
Christian trinity also seems to be a gay group: God the father, God the
son, and a strange fellow, the Holy Ghost – not a single woman.</p><p><br></p><p>The popes down the ages have burnt thousands of women alive,
condemning them as witches. What was the criterion for them to decide
who was a witch? Now there are no witches at all; suddenly they
appeared, and suddenly they disappeared. There was no criterion, any man
could inform the pope.</p><p><br></p><p>The pope had appointed a special court. Just the suspicion that a
certain woman seems to be a witch... any man was eligible to suspect
her.</p><p><br></p><p>No reason was asked, the woman was immediately caught and tortured so
much for days on end, kept hungry, thirsty... beating her. They had
invented machines for torture, and finally, because that seemed to be
the only way to get rid of the torture, she had to confess that she was
a witch. Her confession was the only criterion; and a confession you can
get from anybody, if you torture enough and there is no way out. They
dictated to her what she had to tell the court: that she was a witch and
she had a sexual relationship with the devil.</p><p><br></p><p>The devil does not exist, but the woman had to say it in the court;
otherwise the torture would start again. Once she accepted in the court
that she was a witch and she had a sexual relationship with the devil,
then the court was satisfied. There was no need of any other evidence.
The judgement was simple: the woman had to be burnt alive in the middle
of the town, so everybody could see what happened if you had a sexual
relationship with the devil. Thousands of women were simply burnt, and
these popes were responsible for it. These popes don’t show any joy, any
blissfulness, any creativity, any silence. Yes, they go on doing stupid
things: kissing the earth. When this Polack pope came here, on Delhi
airport he kissed the earth. I said, “This is his first taste of the
Hindu religion, because here the whole earth is full of cowdung, holy
cowdung.” But by kissing the earth you simply show your stupidity and
nothing else.</p><p><br></p><p>Zarathustra is saying, THEY WOULD HAVE TO SING BETTER SONGS TO MAKE
ME BELIEVE</p><p>IN THEIR REDEEMER.<span class=s4></span>They have to show that they
are redeemed, that they are awakened, that</p><p>they are liberated.<span class=s4></span>HIS DISCIPLES WOULD HAVE
TO LOOK MORE REDEEMED! But that is</p><p>not the case: they look more and more enslaved.</p><p>I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE THEM NAKED: FOR BEAUTY ALONE SHOULD PREACH
PENITENCE.</p><p>Why should they hide themselves? They should come out naked, in the
open; they have nothing to hide. But do you think this Polack, if he
comes naked, will look beautiful? He will look like a cartoon, of course
not made by a great artist, just some amateur cartoonist.</p><p><br></p><p>THE SPIRIT OF THEIR REDEEMERS CONSISTED OF HOLES; BUT INTO EVERY HOLE
THEY HAD PUT THEIR ILLUSION, THEIR STOP-GAP, WHICH THEY CALLED GOD.</p><p><br></p><p>If one looks with a magnifying glass at the life of Jesus, or the
life of Gautam Buddha, or the life of Mahavira, or any other religious
founder, one will find many holes in him, because nobody is perfect.
They have filled those holes with illusion, their stop-gap, which they
called God.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard that in paradise Moses and Jesus, both had gone fishing.
Jesus asked Moses, “Is it really true that you parted the ocean and made
a way for your people?”</p><p><br></p><p>Moses said, “As far as I remember, it is true.” Jesus said, “Can you
do it again?”</p><p>Moses said, “I am not certain, but I will try.”</p><p><br></p><p>He tried and he parted the lake into two parts. Old Jesus was amazed
and he said, “Your memory is great!”</p><p><br></p><p>Moses asked, “What about you! You used to walk on water I have heard.
Can you do that now?” Jesus said, “I can try. I used to, that much I
remember.”</p><p><br></p><p>So he got out of the boat and started drowning.</p><p><br></p><p>Moses had to pull him back in. He said, “What happened, my son?” He
said, “I forgot one thing: that time I had no holes in my feet.”</p><p><br></p><p>They all have holes, and the work of their priests is to go on
filling those holes with good stories, fictions, mythologies, all kinds
of lies, miracles.</p><p><br></p><p>ZEALOUSLY AND WITH CLAMOR THEY DROVE THEIR HERDS OVER THEIR BRIDGE:
AS</p><p>IF THERE WERE ONLY ONE BRIDGE TO THE FUTURE! This is where
Zarathustra cannot be categorized with any other mystic. He is saying
there are many bridges to the future. Life is multi- dimensional.</p><p><br></p><p>TRULY, THESE SHEPHERDS, TOO, STILL BELONGED AMONG THE SHEEP! They
are</p><p>pretenders. They call themselves shepherds, but they belong to the
same crowd as the sheep, because they are not aware of a simple fact:
that to the future there are many bridges. Man has so many
potentialities. He can become so many different kinds of superman. And
we will need in the world every superman to be unique, so that the
variety, and the beauty that variety brings, remains alive on the earth.
If everybody becomes just the same, life will become a boredom.</p><p>THEY WROTE LETTERS OF BLOOD ON THE PATH THEY FOLLOWED, AND THEIR
FOLLY TAUGHT THAT TRUTH IS PROVED BY BLOOD.</p><p><br></p><p>BUT BLOOD IS THE WORST WITNESS OF TRUTH; BLOOD POISONS AND TRANSFORMS
THE PUREST TEACHING TO DELUSION AND HATRED OF THE HEART.</p><p><br></p><p>But for thousands of years blood has been the only argument. Whoever
can cut your head with a sword has proved that his religion is right.
The sword cannot be an argument, but it has been the argument for
thousands of years. This shows how the priests have stopped man’s
growth, hindered in every way his flights into the open sky – they have
not allowed freedom.</p><p><br></p><p>AND YOU, MY BROTHERS, MUST BE REDEEMED BY GREATER MEN THAN ANY
REDEEMER HAS BEEN, IF YOU WOULD FIND THE WAY TO FREEDOM!</p><p><br></p><p>All that you need is to find a way to total freedom, freedom from all
kinds of psychological and spiritual bondage, and you yourself will
become your own redeemer. You will be a far superior man than all your
redeemers have been.</p><p><br></p><p>... THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA.</p><p><br></p><p>Okay, Maneesha?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, Osho.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part21>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

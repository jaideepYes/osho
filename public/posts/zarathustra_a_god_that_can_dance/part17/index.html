TRULY, A NEW ROARING IN THE DEPTHS AND THE VOICE OF A NEW FOUNTAIN!\nIT IS POWER, THIS NEW VIRTUE; IT IS A RULING IDEA, AND AROUND IT A SUBTLE SOUL: A GOLDEN SUN, AND AROUND IT THE SERPENT OF KNOWLEDGE.\n... THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA.\nMAN HAS ALWAYS thought about the meaning of virtue, but no man has ever brought the dimension that Zarathustra brings to the world of virtues. Virtue has always been preached by the religions as a means to reward, as a means to heaven, as a means to become a favorite of God, of existence.\nBut all these religions have given virtue an extrinsic meaning, a meaning that comes from outside, not a meaning that grows from within. Zarathustra brings a meaning to the word virtue intrinsically,\njust the way flowers blossom, and are connected deep down with roots, deep into the earth. They are not separate; the earth may not show the colors and the perfume, the beauty; but it is all hidden in it and becomes expressed in the flowers. The seed of virtue is within you, it has nothing to do with any reward. It is a reward unto itself. It is not a means to anything , it is an end in itself.\nZarathustra has to be understood very deeply, because this understanding will change your whole concept of a religious life, of a spiritual revolution, of a new man who will be religious but without religions; who will be religious but without any objectives; whose religiousness will be just a fragrance of his innermost being. And his virtue will be to share it, to bestow it over the whole existence.\nZarathustra asks his disciples, TELL ME: HOW DID GOLD COME TO HAVE THE HIGHEST VALUE? BECAUSE IT IS UNCOMMON AND USELESS AND SHINING AND MELLOW IN LUSTRE.\nIT ALWAYS BESTOWS ITSELF. The things that he is saying about gold are true about the highest virtues of truth, of beauty, of good, of love.\nContemplate on each single point that he is making: it is uncommon, it is unique, it is rare. The moment a virtue becomes common, it ceases to be a virtue. Its being uncommon, its being a rarity, its being something unique is its very nature. If everybody in the world is truthful, truth will not be a virtue anymore. Who will call it a virtue?\nIf being compassionate was a common quality of human beings, compassion would disappear from the list of great virtues. In other words, virtues are of the individual, not of the common crowd.\nAnd secondly, it is useless. Zarathustra’s insight into things is so clear, so transparent, so uncompromising, that he has the courage even to say that virtues are useless. Because anything that is useful, is only a means to something else. The useful is always the means, never the end.\nLove cannot be a means to anything. The moment you make your love a means to something, it is no longer love. Love has to remain useless to keep its beauty, its joy, its fragrance. The moment it becomes a means, a staircase to reach somewhere, to attain some end, then the end becomes significant; love becomes insignificant in comparison to the end.\nHence, love cannot have any end to it – neither can truth, nor good. To say that they are useless shocks many people, because you think love should be the greatest, most useful thing. Truth must be the most useful thing. But you don’t understand the mechanics of life’s workings – anything useful falls down into the lower category of means. The end is always useless.\nReligions have been discussing for centuries, but it is strange that not a single man in the whole history has asked, “What is the use of God?” If love has to be useful, if truth has to be useful, if good has to be useful, if beauty has to be useful, then what is the use of God? God must be the most useless thing in the world.\nIt will hurt the so-called religious people; but fortunately, there is no God, and nobody needs to be hurt. But if there was a God, he was bound to be useless, utterly useless, just good for nothing – because he will be the end of all, but means for none. For a man like Zarathustra, virtue is in the place of God: to be virtuous is to be religious. But for ordinary religions, to be virtuous means that you are using it to reach God, to attain self-realization, to enter into paradise.\nBut for Zarathustra, useless is not a word of condemnation. What is the use of a rose flower? You say, “It is beautiful”, but what is the use of beauty? What is the use of a beautiful sunset, when the clouds in the sky become so psychedelic, so colorful – as if the whole horizon has become poetic? The birds are returning home... what could be the use of such a beautiful sunset? There is no use at all. And the artist has known it down the ages. Hence, he has said, “Art for arts sake”. It is an end unto itself.\nAnd thirdly, it is SHINING AND MELLOW IN LUSTRE, IT ALWAYS BESTOWS ITSELF. It is luminous, it does not need anything to decorate it, it is utterly self-sufficient, overflowingly joyful, aglow with blissfulness, for no other reason than just being itself.\nZarathustra starts his statement by asking the disciples, why gold has come to have the highest value? And he gives three reasons: It is uncommon, it is useless, it is self-luminous.\nONLY AS AN IMAGE OF THE HIGHEST VIRTUE DID EGOLD COME TO HAVE THE HIGHEST\nVALUE. It is just symbolic. The people who have known the highest virtue in life were finding a symbol to express it. Gold satisfied a little bit as an expression, as an indication of the highest value.\nGOLD-LIKE GLEAMS THE GLANCE OF THE GIVER. And the man who bestows his virtues over others, who gives his inner riches, shares himself with others, his eyes gleam, gold-like. They have a shine, a luminosity which has no comparison.\nTHE HIGHEST VIRTUE IS UNCOMMON AND USELESS, IT IS SHINING AND MELLOW IN LUSTRE: THE HIGHEST VIRTUE IS A BESTOWING VIRTUE.\nTRULY, I DIVINE YOU WELL, MY DISCIPLES, YOU ASPIRE TO THE BESTOWING VIRTUE, AS I DO.…\nYOU THIRST TO BECOME SACRIFICES AND GIFTS YOURSELVES: AND THAT IS WHY YOU THIRST TO HEAP UP ALL RICHES IN YOUR SOUL.\nPerhaps, no one has pointed it out the way Zarathustra is pointing it out – why people go on the search for truth or search for self. All the great teachers of mankind have been calling people to search: Who are you? Know thyself. But for what?\nZarathustra has the answer. Know your riches, know your treasures, so that you can share, so that you can bestow them over others. Find oneself just for sharing, because the moment you share yourself you transcend ordinary humanity, you become a superman.\nThe ordinary man is greedy, he is a beggar. He goes on accumulating, he never gives; he does not know the language of giving, or the joy of giving. He’s very poor – he knows only the very trivial pleasure of getting. In getting, even if you get the whole world, your pleasure will be trivial; and in giving, you may give only a rose flower, your joy will be that of an emperor.\nGiving, perhaps is the most blissful experience in the world; and when you give yourself, when you give something from your innermost being, you truly give.\nYOU THIRST TO BECOME SACRIFICES AND GIFTS YOURSELVES: AND THAT IS WHY YOU THIRST TO HEAP UP ALL RICHES IN YOUR SOUL.\nYOUR SOUL ASPIRES INSATIABLY AFTER TREASURES AND JEWELS, BECAUSE YOUR VIRTUE IS INSATIABLE IN WANTING TO GIVE.\nThe whole religious endeavor, the whole spiritual pilgrimage, the whole discovery of oneself, is for a simple reason: that unless you know yourself, you cannot give. How can you give that which is unknown to you? And the miracle is, the moment you know yourself you cannot resist the temptation of giving. It comes with the finding; immediately you want to shout to the whole world, “I have found the source of life, come and share with me”.\nWhenever you experience something of the beyond, you cannot contain it within yourself. It is just impossible, it is not in the nature of life.\nThe greater is your inner achievement, the greater will be the desire to give. You will be puzzled in the beginning – your thirst was great to find the source of life; but now you know, your desire to share is even greater.\nAnd the mystery that you will encounter is: the more you give, the more you have it; the less you give, the less you have it. If you don’t give, you will lose track of it. You can keep it in your possession only by sharing, by sharing without holding anything back, emptying yourself. And existence takes care; as you are emptying yourself, from unknown sources of your life existence is pouring fresher juices, fresher riches – you are never empty. Your fullness becomes infinite, but it becomes infinite only by giving infinitely.\nYOU COMPEL ALL THINGS TO COME TO YOU AND INTO YOU, THAT THEY MAY FLOW BACK FROM YOUR FOUNTAIN AS GIFTS OF YOUR LOVE.\nThere is no other religion in the world. All other religions are fake, all other religions are simply substitutes to deceive people. The only religion is the religion of love. And when you have found infinite sources within you, your love demands to share with those who are worthy, with those who are unworthy, without any discrimination, because love knows no discrimination.\nIt is only the poor who discriminate. The richer your soul is... discrimination becomes impossible. Then it is not a question of whether somebody is worthy or unworthy: to you all that matters is that there is somebody to receive. And you are grateful to the person who receives, not vice versa. You are not hoping the person will be grateful to you because you have given something to him.\nIn the East, there has been a tradition, very strange.… The Buddhist monks or Jaina monks or Hindu monks... these are the three religions born in India, which have the flavor of the East. When you give food or clothes to a monk – because monks are beggars, they don’t possess anything – whatever they need, they beg.… When the sun sets they should not possess anything: tomorrow will take care of itself. Such is their trust, that if up to now life has taken care there is no reason why tomorrow it will not take care. By the evening, they are absolutely possessionless; in the morning whatever they need, they beg.\nThe strange tradition that I was going to tell you about is that when you give something to a monk, then you have to give him something more. That something more is called your gratefulness, because the monk received your gifts. He could have refused. Because he has received your food, you have to offer him something else to show your gratitude, that you came to my house, you begged food of me – you accepted my food. I was not deserving enough to give, and particularly, to you. Still you were generous enough to receive, so please, as a symbol of my thankful-ness, receive something more.\nWhen I first became aware of this, it looked very strange. Ordinary logic will say that the monk has to be thankful; you have given him food, you have given him clothes, you have given him medicine, or anything that he needed – he should be thankful. But on the contrary, the tradition is that you should be thankful, and not just verbally, you have to give something symbolically, to show your gratitude.\nThat very ancient idea has a relevance to what Zarathustra is saying. You share yourself, you share your love – do not discriminate, who are you to discriminate? Existence does not discriminate. You should not pretend to be wiser than existence itself. All that you can do is show your gratitude, too, because he allowed you to share your being with him, he allowed your raincloud to shower on him. It is up to you to be grateful to the thirsty earth, to the rose bushes; they have made you richer by receiving. And as you are giving from your innermost sources, you will find new waters are coming and filling your cup; your cup is never empty. TRULY, SUCH A BESTOWING LOVE MUST BECOME A THIEF OF ALL VALUES. Love is enough, all other values can become shadows to it.\nSUCH A BESTOWING LOVE MUST BECOME A THIEF OF ALL VALUES; BUT I CALL THIS\nSELFISHNESS HEALTHY AND HOLY. Perhaps, after twenty-five centuries since Zarathustra, I am the only man who has used the word selfishness as the foundation of all spirituality. Otherwise, all the religions have been talking about selflessness. And nobody bothers how you can be selfless; you don’t even know what your self is. You have never entered into yourself.\nOne of the great Christian missionaries, Stanley Jones, used to come to India; six months in India, and six months in the West – that was his every-year routine. And I had many chances... because he used to stay very close by where I was teaching in a university, and we often met on our morning walks, or on our evening walks. The one thing that was continuously a question mark between us two was that he continually said that compared to Christianity, all Eastern religions are selfish, because their emphasis is on meditation; and meditation means going inwards, in your aloneness, to the very center of your being, while Christianity teaches you to go to the poor.\nIn your meditation, you will not find the poor, and start opening hospitals; you will not find orphans, and start opening orphanages; you will not find the sick – so what will you do inside? The real work is outside. There are poor people, there are hungry people, there are sick people, there are starving people, there are orphans, there are prostitutes... and there are so many problems. And surrounded with all these problems, you teach people to meditate, to go within yourself? This is selfishness.\nThe first time when he said this to me I listened, and I remained silent. He asked, “What is the matter? Why you are not answering me? Do you agree with me, or disagree with me?”\nI said, “The question of agreement does not arise. I was just being silent. I was feeling sad for you.” He said, “What? You are feeling sad for me?”\nI said, “Yes, because what you call altruistic work, selfless service, is sheer nonsense. Because the man who does not know himself, he himself is an orphan – an orphan in the spiritual sense. He has not yet found his roots in existence, he’s still a mortal body. He does not know anything about the eternal spirit. And unless he knows himself, and knows the immense treasures contained therein, he cannot be of any help to anybody.”\nSo I told Stanley Jones, “Remember, never again say that meditation is selfishness. Meditation is the only way. Through being selfish, a moment comes... your whole life becomes selfless. But it happens only by being totally centered within yourself, and then you have compassion, and you have love, and then you can do whatever you want to do.\nThe poor will be there, the sick will be there, the orphans will be there; and now you can help them in some way. But first, save yourself. You are drowning, and you are trying to save others – and you call it authentic religion. I call it simply nonsense.”\n“Selfishness”, says Zarathustra, “is healthy and holy”, because only out of selfishness everything that is beautiful, creative, loving, grows. And then, whatever you do, you don’t want any reward for it, you don’t want any heaven, any paradise, any God; you don’t want anything in reward. It is a reward unto itself. It is not a means to anything else. And unless your life becomes a reward unto itself, you are not religious. This can be the definition of a religious man: a man whose life has become a reward unto itself – selfish, healthy and holy.\nOUR MIND FLIES UPWARD: THUS IT IS AN IMAGE OF OUR BODIES, AN IMAGE OF AN ADVANCE AND ELEVATION.\nTHE NAMES OF THE VIRTUES ARE SUCH IMAGES OF ADVANCES AND ELEVATIONS.\nTHUS THE BODY GOES THROUGH HISTORY, EVOLVING AND BATTLING. AND THE SPIRIT – WHAT IS IT TO THE BODY? THE HERALD, COMPANION, AND ECHO OF ITS BATTLES AND VICTORIES.\nOur values are our flights, far away flights into the unknown: our flights into our own consciousness. And our inner world is not smaller than the outer space. We are exactly at the midpoint: on the outside is infinite space, on the inside there is also infinite space. Don’t be worried about how in such a small body there can be infinite space. It is not contained in the body, it only touches the body – the center of the body. And then, it is beyond the body, it goes on spreading to no limit. Our center is the center of outer and inner existence. And the higher is our flight, the purer becomes our body, because the greater becomes our spirit – the body goes almost as if gold is passing through fire. It becomes purer and purer.\nEven the body becomes a great value: innocence, peace, serenity, beauty, grace – so many treasures open up in the body, too.\nALL NAMES OF GOOD AND EVIL ARE IMAGES: THEY DO NOT SPEAK OUT, THEY ONLY HINT.\nAll words about spiritual values are just hints. Don’t hold onto the words as if they are realities. They are hints, almost the way I can point to the moon with my finger – but don’t catch hold of my finger. My finger is not the moon. Although my finger was pointing to the moon, it was only a hint.\nIn one of the temples of Japan, there is no statue of Gautam Buddha in the temple. Instead of a statue there is a finger pointing to a far away moon. It is a temple of its own kind, because Buddha is nothing but a finger pointing to the moon. Don’t go on worshiping the finger – that will not help. Look at the moon where the finger is pointing. Forget the finger, forget the scriptures, forget the masters, forget all your religions; just try to find out what they are hinting at, and you will be surprised to find that thousands of fingers are pointing at the same moon.\nAnd the followers of these fingers are fighting and killing each other. Mohammedans killing Christians, Christians killing Jews, Hindus killing Mohammedans; and nobody bothers that you are fighting for fingers. The fingers may be different, but the moon is the same. The angles of the fingers may be different, because people were standing in different places at different times, in different ages. How can Krishna point exactly the way Jesus is pointing? How can Buddha point in the same way Zarathustra is pointing?\nAnd it is possible, somebody may be a left-handed person. You will kill all those leftists, these idiots; the whole world is believing in right-hand fingers, and these are believing left-hand fingers! Right is somehow right, and left is wrong.\nYou will be surprised, ten percent of people are left handed. It is not a small percentage, but they have been forced, from the very beginning, to use the right hand. Because use the left hand, and you will be a laughing-stock everywhere, you will feel embarrassed everywhere, in school, in your whole life. So, they have been forced, and they have learned to write with their right hand; but if they were left to nature, ten percent of the people in the world would have been writing with their left hand. And certainly, out of ten masters, at least one master would have been pointing to the moon with the left hand.\nTHESE IMAGES DO NOT SPEAK OUT, THEY ONLY HINT.\nHE IS A FOOL WHO SEEKS KNOWLEDGE FROM THEM. The person who seeks knowledge from these indications in the scriptures, in words, in statues is a fool. The search has to be withinwards, because they are all pointing – that the kingdom of God is within you. And unless you go inwards, unless you close your eyes and relax your mind, unless your heart, your mind, your body all become a synchronicity, a harmony, a deep accord – you will not be able to hear the still small voice within you.\nAnd that voice is nobody else’s voice, it is your own. And remember, only the truth that is your own, liberates. Anybody else’s truth always becomes a bondage.\nWHENEVER YOUR SPIRIT WANTS TO SPEAK IN IMAGES, PAY HEED: FOR THAT IS WHEN YOUR VIRTUE HAS ITS ORIGIN AND BEGINNING.\nTHEN YOUR BODY IS ELEVATED AND RISEN UP; IT ENRAPTURES THE SPIRIT WITH ITS JOY, THAT IT MAY BECOME CREATOR AND EVALUATOR AND LOVER AND BENEFACTOR OF ALL THINGS.\nThe past has been an utter failure, because we created so-called religious people, but we could not create the creators. And unless a religious person contributes to the world through some creativity,\nhe has not known the ecstasy of his being; otherwise, he would have shared it in a thousand and one ways – perhaps in music, perhaps in dance, perhaps in song, perhaps in poetry. But he would have uttered it; it would have overflowed him.\nIn my vision, the creators are more religious than the people who go to the churches, to the temples, to the mosques, the people who do long fasts, the people who torture their bodies, the people who go through many kinds of austerities: these are a little bit crazy type of people – off center. If the whole world becomes religious in their way, you will find it turning into a madhouse. It has almost turned!\nJust the other day, I was telling you about Vincent Van Gogh, the famous Dutch painter, who could not sell a single painting in his life, because nobody could understand the beauty of his paintings. He was too far ahead of his times. And just today, Anando brought me a newsclipping about one of his paintings of flowers, which has broken all the records up to now. It has been sold for forty million dollars. Van Gogh died in poverty, and finally became mad, because he had not enough to eat.\nRather than eating, he preferred to paint. So whatsoever he could get, he would not eat, he would purchase paint, canvasses. And he would paint, hungry, the whole day in the hot sun, standing when he was painting. The hot sun and hunger drove him to madness. When he was released from the madhouse after one year – because all that he needed was rest, good food – he painted his last painting, and committed suicide. He was only thirty-three.\nAnd he wrote a letter to his brothers, “Don’t think that I am committing suicide. I am not an escapist, but the reason that I am leaving this world is that I cannot manage both my body and my paintings. I have prolonged as long as it was possible; moreover, I have painted the painting that I wanted to paint. I am dying completely fulfilled, with no regret, with no complaint.”\nAnd now, in that news cutting, in front of his painting there are iron bars – because now it is worth forty million dollars – and two constables standing with loaded guns to protect the painting, and nobody gave even bread and butter to the painter.\nI will call Van Gogh a saint, because life mistreated him as badly as you can conceive. Yet in his last letter he has no complaint, no grudge; and he’s dying utterly fulfilled, because whatever he wanted to do he has done. He contributed some beauty to the world. He has contributed it whether people understand it or not. “That is not my business; that is their problem.” After one hundred years, now his paintings are being searched out, because each painting has become so valuable, that even the greatest painters are left far behind. This is the record: no painting has been sold up to now for forty million dollars. And it is a painting only of roses. You will not give forty million dollars for real roses.\nBut in his whole life – I have read all his letters, that’s all that he has written – there is not even a single place where he is angry, or condemnatory, or in any way saying anything against the world. Again and again he says, “I can understand. If they cannot see beauty in my paintings, what can they do? Neither I can do anything, nor they can do anything.\n“I have come before my time; my paintings will have to wait for my people to come. When my people are here, perhaps they will recognize then, if my paintings survive.”\nNo museum was ready to take those paintings free. People were ashamed; his friends were ashamed, because he used to give his friends his paintings, these same paintings “... just to keep, because I don’t have enough space. I live in a small room, I cannot pay more rent, and I don’t have a space to keep all my paintings. So, just hang it on your wall.” People would hang it on their wall, and the moment he was gone they would throw it in their basement. “Anybody who comes here will think we are mad because we cannot say what this painting means.”\nAll two hundred paintings have been found in people’s basements, in strange places. And a great search goes on, because he has painted thousands of paintings and distributed them to people, because he had no place to keep them.\nI will call this man a saint who lives the life of sacrifice; but sacrifice not to some hypothetical god, sacrifice not to some wooden statue, but sacrifice to share his joy, and his beauty, and his vision, and his dreams. If the contemporary people cannot understand it, he is ready to wait. He will not be here, but somebody, somewhere in the future will understand it, will rejoice in it; and that is a good enough reward.\nSuch trust in one’s own creativity, such trust that someday there will be someone who is going to understand him – he cannot remain misunderstood forever – can only be a quality of a saint, a true sage.\nWHEN YOUR HEART SURGES BROAD AND FULL LIKE A RIVER, A BLESSING AND A DANGER TO THOSE WHO LIVE NEARBY: THAT IS WHEN YOUR VIRTUE HAS ITS ORIGIN\nAND BEGINNING. Zarathustra is saying a tremendously significant thing. WHEN YOUR HEART SURGES BROAD AND FULL LIKE A RIVER, A BLESSING AND A DANGER TO THOSE WHO\nLIVE NEARBY. A man like Zarathustra is a blessing only to very few people; only for those who are courageous enough to come close to him, who are courageous enough to go with him into the unknown, on the untrodden path, against tradition, against orthodoxies, against conventions, against the crowd.\nBut to most of the people it is a danger. The very presence of a man whose heart is overflowing like a river, with love, is a danger. His love can drown you, his love can destroy your ego. To be close to such a person is to lose your boundaries, your identity.\nThat’s why such people are hated so much; so much that Socrates has to be poisoned. He must have become a great danger to the people of Athens. What danger can he be? His love, his truth, his individuality, his overflowing bliss is as dangerous as a flood. Perhaps in a flood there is a possibility that you can swim out; but once you are caught in the flood of love, you cannot swim out.\nDown the ages, people who have been really a blessing have been thought to be curses. Only very few people, courageous, intelligent, with guts, ready to risk, and ready to go on an adventure in deep trust and love, knew their blessings; the others knew only their danger. And it is better to destroy such dangerous people, because they can create chaos in the whole society.\nBut the chaos created by a man like Zarathustra, Socrates, or Jesus is a chaos out of which stars are born, is a chaos out of which man reaches to higher peaks of evolution. The old is destroyed, and the new is born. It is a chaos to be welcomed. But even now, the situation remains exactly the same.\nWHEN YOU ARE EXALTED ABOVE PRAISE AND BLAME, AND YOUR WILL WANTS TO COMMAND ALL THINGS AS ETHE WILL OF A LOVER: THAT IS WHEN YOUR VIRTUE HAS ITS ORIGIN AND BEGINNING.…\nWHEN YOU ARE WILLERS OF A SINGLE WILL, AND YOU CALL THIS DISPELLER OF NEED YOUR ESSENTIAL AND NECESSITY: THAT IS WHEN YOUR VIRTUE HAS ITS ORIGIN AND BEGINNING.\nTRULY, IT IS A NEW GOOD AND EVIL!

SUBTLE SOUL: A GOLDEN SUN, AND AROUND IT THE SERPENT OF KNOWLEDGE.</p><p><br></p><p>... THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA.</p><p><br></p><p>MAN HAS ALWAYS thought about the meaning of virtue, but no man has
ever brought the dimension that Zarathustra brings to the world of
virtues. Virtue has always been preached by the religions as a means to
reward, as a means to heaven, as a means to become a favorite of God, of
existence.</p><p><br></p><p>But all these religions have given virtue an extrinsic meaning, a
meaning that comes from outside, not a meaning that grows from within.
Zarathustra brings a meaning to the word virtue intrinsically,</p><p>just the way flowers blossom, and are connected deep down with roots,
deep into the earth. They are not separate; the earth may not show the
colors and the perfume, the beauty; but it is all hidden in it and
becomes expressed in the flowers. The seed of virtue is within you, it
has nothing to do with any reward. It is a reward unto itself. It is not
a means to anything , it is an end in itself.</p><p><br></p><p>Zarathustra has to be understood very deeply, because this
understanding will change your whole concept of a religious life, of a
spiritual revolution, of a new man who will be religious but without
religions; who will be religious but without any objectives; whose
religiousness will be just a fragrance of his innermost being. And his
virtue will be to share it, to bestow it over the whole existence.</p><p><br></p><p>Zarathustra asks his disciples, TELL ME: HOW DID GOLD COME TO HAVE
THE HIGHEST VALUE? BECAUSE IT IS UNCOMMON AND USELESS AND SHINING AND
MELLOW IN LUSTRE.</p><p>IT ALWAYS BESTOWS ITSELF. The things that he is saying about gold are
true about the highest virtues of truth, of beauty, of good, of
love.</p><p><br></p><p>Contemplate on each single point that he is making: it is uncommon,
it is unique, it is rare. The moment a virtue becomes common, it ceases
to be a virtue. Its being uncommon, its being a rarity, its being
something unique is its very nature. If everybody in the world is
truthful, truth will not be a virtue anymore. Who will call it a
virtue?</p><p><br></p><p>If being compassionate was a common quality of human beings,
compassion would disappear from the list of great virtues. In other
words, virtues are of the individual, not of the common crowd.</p><p><br></p><p>And secondly, it is useless. Zarathustra’s insight into things is so
clear, so transparent, so uncompromising, that he has the courage even
to say that virtues are useless. Because anything that is useful, is
only a means to something else. The useful is always the means, never
the end.</p><p><br></p><p>Love cannot be a means to anything. The moment you make your love a
means to something, it is no longer love. Love has to remain useless to
keep its beauty, its joy, its fragrance. The moment it becomes a means,
a staircase to reach somewhere, to attain some end, then the end becomes
significant; love becomes insignificant in comparison to the end.</p><p><br></p><p>Hence, love cannot have any end to it – neither can truth, nor good.
To say that they are useless shocks many people, because you think love
should be the greatest, most useful thing. Truth must be the most useful
thing. But you don’t understand the mechanics of life’s workings –
anything useful falls down into the lower category of means. The end is
always useless.</p><p><br></p><p>Religions have been discussing for centuries, but it is strange that
not a single man in the whole history has asked, “What is the use of
God?” If love has to be useful, if truth has to be useful, if good has
to be useful, if beauty has to be useful, then what is the use of God?
God must be the most useless thing in the world.</p><p><br></p><p>It will hurt the so-called religious people; but fortunately, there
is no God, and nobody needs to be hurt. But if there was a God, he was
bound to be useless, utterly useless, just good for nothing – because he
will be the end of all, but means for none. For a man like Zarathustra,
virtue is in the place of God: to be virtuous is to be religious. But
for ordinary religions, to be virtuous means that you are using it to
reach God, to attain self-realization, to enter into paradise.</p><p>But for Zarathustra, useless is not a word of condemnation. What is
the use of a rose flower? You say, “It is beautiful”, but what is the
use of beauty? What is the use of a beautiful sunset, when the clouds in
the sky become so psychedelic, so colorful – as if the whole horizon has
become poetic? The birds are returning home... what could be the use of
such a beautiful sunset? There is no use at all. And the artist has
known it down the ages. Hence, he has said, “Art for arts sake”. It is
an end unto itself.</p><p><br></p><p>And thirdly, it is SHINING AND MELLOW IN LUSTRE, IT ALWAYS BESTOWS
ITSELF. It is luminous, it does not need anything to decorate it, it is
utterly self-sufficient, overflowingly joyful, aglow with blissfulness,
for no other reason than just being itself.</p><p><br></p><p>Zarathustra starts his statement by asking the disciples, why gold
has come to have the highest value? And he gives three reasons: It is
uncommon, it is useless, it is self-luminous.</p><p><br></p><p>ONLY AS AN IMAGE OF THE HIGHEST VIRTUE DID EGOLD COME TO HAVE THE
HIGHEST</p><p>VALUE. It is just symbolic. The people who have known the highest
virtue in life were finding a symbol to express it. Gold satisfied a
little bit as an expression, as an indication of the highest value.</p><p><br></p><p>GOLD-LIKE GLEAMS THE GLANCE OF THE GIVER. And the man who bestows his
virtues over others, who gives his inner riches, shares himself with
others, his eyes gleam, gold-like. They have a shine, a luminosity which
has no comparison.</p><p><br></p><p>THE HIGHEST VIRTUE IS UNCOMMON AND USELESS, IT IS SHINING AND MELLOW
IN LUSTRE: THE HIGHEST VIRTUE IS A BESTOWING VIRTUE.</p><p><br></p><p>TRULY, I DIVINE YOU WELL, MY DISCIPLES, YOU ASPIRE TO THE BESTOWING
VIRTUE, AS I DO.…</p><p><br></p><p>YOU THIRST TO BECOME SACRIFICES AND GIFTS YOURSELVES: AND THAT IS WHY
YOU THIRST TO HEAP UP ALL RICHES IN YOUR SOUL.</p><p><br></p><p>Perhaps, no one has pointed it out the way Zarathustra is pointing it
out – why people go on the search for truth or search for self. All the
great teachers of mankind have been calling people to search: Who are
you? Know thyself. But for what?</p><p><br></p><p>Zarathustra has the answer. Know your riches, know your treasures, so
that you can share, so that you can bestow them over others. Find
oneself just for sharing, because the moment you share yourself you
transcend ordinary humanity, you become a superman.</p><p><br></p><p>The ordinary man is greedy, he is a beggar. He goes on accumulating,
he never gives; he does not know the language of giving, or the joy of
giving. He’s very poor – he knows only the very trivial pleasure of
getting. In getting, even if you get the whole world, your pleasure will
be trivial; and in giving, you may give only a rose flower, your joy
will be that of an emperor.</p><p><br></p><p>Giving, perhaps is the most blissful experience in the world; and
when you give yourself, when you give something from your innermost
being, you truly give.</p><p>YOU THIRST TO BECOME SACRIFICES AND GIFTS YOURSELVES: AND THAT IS WHY
YOU THIRST TO HEAP UP ALL RICHES IN YOUR SOUL.</p><p><br></p><p>YOUR SOUL ASPIRES INSATIABLY AFTER TREASURES AND JEWELS, BECAUSE YOUR
VIRTUE IS INSATIABLE IN WANTING TO GIVE.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole religious endeavor, the whole spiritual pilgrimage, the
whole discovery of oneself, is for a simple reason: that unless you know
yourself, you cannot give. How can you give that which is unknown to
you? And the miracle is, the moment you know yourself you cannot resist
the temptation of giving. It comes with the finding; immediately you
want to shout to the whole world, “I have found the source of life, come
and share with me”.</p><p><br></p><p>Whenever you experience something of the beyond, you cannot contain
it within yourself. It is just impossible, it is not in the nature of
life.</p><p><br></p><p>The greater is your inner achievement, the greater will be the desire
to give. You will be puzzled in the beginning – your thirst was great to
find the source of life; but now you know, your desire to share is even
greater.</p><p><br></p><p>And the mystery that you will encounter is: the more you give, the
more you have it; the less you give, the less you have it. If you don’t
give, you will lose track of it. You can keep it in your possession only
by sharing, by sharing without holding anything back, emptying yourself.
And existence takes care; as you are emptying yourself, from unknown
sources of your life existence is pouring fresher juices, fresher riches
– you are never empty. Your fullness becomes infinite, but it becomes
infinite only by giving infinitely.</p><p><br></p><p>YOU COMPEL ALL THINGS TO COME TO YOU AND INTO YOU, THAT THEY MAY FLOW
BACK FROM YOUR FOUNTAIN AS GIFTS OF YOUR LOVE.</p><p><br></p><p>There is no other religion in the world. All other religions are
fake, all other religions are simply substitutes to deceive people. The
only religion is the religion of love. And when you have found infinite
sources within you, your love demands to share with those who are
worthy, with those who are unworthy, without any discrimination, because
love knows no discrimination.</p><p><br></p><p>It is only the poor who discriminate. The richer your soul is...
discrimination becomes impossible. Then it is not a question of whether
somebody is worthy or unworthy: to you all that matters is that there is
somebody to receive. And you are grateful to the person who receives,
not vice versa. You are not hoping the person will be grateful to you
because you have given something to him.</p><p><br></p><p>In the East, there has been a tradition, very strange.… The Buddhist
monks or Jaina monks or Hindu monks... these are the three religions
born in India, which have the flavor of the East. When you give food or
clothes to a monk – because monks are beggars, they don’t possess
anything – whatever they need, they beg.… When the sun sets they should
not possess anything: tomorrow will take care of itself. Such is their
trust, that if up to now life has taken care there is no reason why
tomorrow it will not take care. By the evening, they are absolutely
possessionless; in the morning whatever they need, they beg.</p><p>The strange tradition that I was going to tell you about is that when
you give something to a monk, then you have to give him something more.
That something more is called your gratefulness, because the monk
received your gifts. He could have refused. Because he has received your
food, you have to offer him something else to show your gratitude, that
you came to my house, you begged food of me – you accepted my food. I
was not deserving enough to give, and particularly, to you. Still you
were generous enough to receive, so please, as a symbol of my
thankful-ness, receive something more.</p><p><br></p><p>When I first became aware of this, it looked very strange. Ordinary
logic will say that the monk has to be thankful; you have given him
food, you have given him clothes, you have given him medicine, or
anything that he needed – he should be thankful. But on the contrary,
the tradition is that you should be thankful, and not just verbally, you
have to give something symbolically, to show your gratitude.</p><p><br></p><p>That very ancient idea has a relevance to what Zarathustra is saying.
You share yourself, you share your love – do not discriminate, who are
you to discriminate? Existence does not discriminate. You should not
pretend to be wiser than existence itself. All that you can do is show
your gratitude, too, because he allowed you to share your being with
him, he allowed your raincloud to shower on him. It is up to you to be
grateful to the thirsty earth, to the rose bushes; they have made you
richer by receiving. And as you are giving from your innermost sources,
you will find new waters are coming and filling your cup; your cup is
never empty. TRULY, SUCH A BESTOWING LOVE MUST BECOME A THIEF OF ALL
VALUES. Love is enough, all other values can become shadows to it.</p><p><br></p><p>SUCH A BESTOWING LOVE MUST BECOME A THIEF OF ALL VALUES; BUT I CALL
THIS</p><p>SELFISHNESS HEALTHY AND HOLY. Perhaps, after twenty-five centuries
since Zarathustra, I am the only man who has used the word selfishness
as the foundation of all spirituality. Otherwise, all the religions have
been talking about selflessness. And nobody bothers how you can be
selfless; you don’t even know what your self is. You have never entered
into yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>One of the great Christian missionaries, Stanley Jones, used to come
to India; six months in India, and six months in the West – that was his
every-year routine. And I had many chances... because he used to stay
very close by where I was teaching in a university, and we often met on
our morning walks, or on our evening walks. The one thing that was
continuously a question mark between us two was that he continually said
that compared to Christianity, all Eastern religions are selfish,
because their emphasis is on meditation; and meditation means going
inwards, in your aloneness, to the very center of your being, while
Christianity teaches you to go to the poor.</p><p><br></p><p>In your meditation, you will not find the poor, and start opening
hospitals; you will not find orphans, and start opening orphanages; you
will not find the sick – so what will you do inside? The real work is
outside. There are poor people, there are hungry people, there are sick
people, there are starving people, there are orphans, there are
prostitutes... and there are so many problems. And surrounded with all
these problems, you teach people to meditate, to go within yourself?
This is selfishness.</p><p><br></p><p>The first time when he said this to me I listened, and I remained
silent. He asked, “What is the matter? Why you are not answering me? Do
you agree with me, or disagree with me?”</p><p>I said, “The question of agreement does not arise. I was just being
silent. I was feeling sad for you.” He said, “What? You are feeling sad
for me?”</p><p>I said, “Yes, because what you call altruistic work, selfless
service, is sheer nonsense. Because the man who does not know himself,
he himself is an orphan – an orphan in the spiritual sense. He has not
yet found his roots in existence, he’s still a mortal body. He does not
know anything about the eternal spirit. And unless he knows himself, and
knows the immense treasures contained therein, he cannot be of any help
to anybody.”</p><p><br></p><p>So I told Stanley Jones, “Remember, never again say that meditation
is selfishness. Meditation is the only way. Through being selfish, a
moment comes... your whole life becomes selfless. But it happens only by
being totally centered within yourself, and then you have compassion,
and you have love, and then you can do whatever you want to do.</p><p><br></p><p>The poor will be there, the sick will be there, the orphans will be
there; and now you can help them in some way. But first, save yourself.
You are drowning, and you are trying to save others – and you call it
authentic religion. I call it simply nonsense.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Selfishness”, says Zarathustra, “is healthy and holy”, because only
out of selfishness everything that is beautiful, creative, loving,
grows. And then, whatever you do, you don’t want any reward for it, you
don’t want any heaven, any paradise, any God; you don’t want anything in
reward. It is a reward unto itself. It is not a means to anything else.
And unless your life becomes a reward unto itself, you are not
religious. This can be the definition of a religious man: a man whose
life has become a reward unto itself – selfish, healthy and holy.</p><p><br></p><p>OUR MIND FLIES UPWARD: THUS IT IS AN IMAGE OF OUR BODIES, AN IMAGE OF
AN ADVANCE AND ELEVATION.</p><p><br></p><p>THE NAMES OF THE VIRTUES ARE SUCH IMAGES OF ADVANCES AND
ELEVATIONS.</p><p><br></p><p>THUS THE BODY GOES THROUGH HISTORY, EVOLVING AND BATTLING. AND THE
SPIRIT – WHAT IS IT TO THE BODY? THE HERALD, COMPANION, AND ECHO OF ITS
BATTLES AND VICTORIES.</p><p><br></p><p>Our values are our flights, far away flights into the unknown: our
flights into our own consciousness. And our inner world is not smaller
than the outer space. We are exactly at the midpoint: on the outside is
infinite space, on the inside there is also infinite space. Don’t be
worried about how in such a small body there can be infinite space. It
is not contained in the body, it only touches the body – the center of
the body. And then, it is beyond the body, it goes on spreading to no
limit. Our center is the center of outer and inner existence. And the
higher is our flight, the purer becomes our body, because the greater
becomes our spirit – the body goes almost as if gold is passing through
fire. It becomes purer and purer.</p><p><br></p><p>Even the body becomes a great value: innocence, peace, serenity,
beauty, grace – so many treasures open up in the body, too.</p><p><br></p><p>ALL NAMES OF GOOD AND EVIL ARE IMAGES: THEY DO NOT SPEAK OUT, THEY
ONLY HINT.</p><p>All words about spiritual values are just hints. Don’t hold onto the
words as if they are realities. They are hints, almost the way I can
point to the moon with my finger – but don’t catch hold of my finger. My
finger is not the moon. Although my finger was pointing to the moon, it
was only a hint.</p><p>In one of the temples of Japan, there is no statue of Gautam Buddha
in the temple. Instead of a statue there is a finger pointing to a far
away moon. It is a temple of its own kind, because Buddha is nothing but
a finger pointing to the moon. Don’t go on worshiping the finger – that
will not help. Look at the moon where the finger is pointing. Forget the
finger, forget the scriptures, forget the masters, forget all your
religions; just try to find out what they are hinting at, and you will
be surprised to find that thousands of fingers are pointing at the same
moon.</p><p><br></p><p>And the followers of these fingers are fighting and killing each
other. Mohammedans killing Christians, Christians killing Jews, Hindus
killing Mohammedans; and nobody bothers that you are fighting for
fingers. The fingers may be different, but the moon is the same. The
angles of the fingers may be different, because people were standing in
different places at different times, in different ages. How can Krishna
point exactly the way Jesus is pointing? How can Buddha point in the
same way Zarathustra is pointing?</p><p><br></p><p>And it is possible, somebody may be a left-handed person. You will
kill all those leftists, these idiots; the whole world is believing in
right-hand fingers, and these are believing left-hand fingers! Right is
somehow right, and left is wrong.</p><p><br></p><p>You will be surprised, ten percent of people are left handed. It is
not a small percentage, but they have been forced, from the very
beginning, to use the right hand. Because use the left hand, and you
will be a laughing-stock everywhere, you will feel embarrassed
everywhere, in school, in your whole life. So, they have been forced,
and they have learned to write with their right hand; but if they were
left to nature, ten percent of the people in the world would have been
writing with their left hand. And certainly, out of ten masters, at
least one master would have been pointing to the moon with the left
hand.</p><p><br></p><p>THESE IMAGES DO NOT SPEAK OUT, THEY ONLY HINT.</p><p><br></p><p>HE IS A FOOL WHO SEEKS KNOWLEDGE FROM THEM. The person who seeks
knowledge from these indications in the scriptures, in words, in statues
is a fool. The search has to be withinwards, because they are all
pointing – that the kingdom of God is within you. And unless you go
inwards, unless you close your eyes and relax your mind, unless your
heart, your mind, your body all become a synchronicity, a harmony, a
deep accord – you will not be able to hear the still small voice within
you.</p><p><br></p><p>And that voice is nobody else’s voice, it is your own. And remember,
only the truth that is your own, liberates. Anybody else’s truth always
becomes a bondage.</p><p><br></p><p>WHENEVER YOUR SPIRIT WANTS TO SPEAK IN IMAGES, PAY HEED: FOR THAT IS
WHEN YOUR VIRTUE HAS ITS ORIGIN AND BEGINNING.</p><p><br></p><p>THEN YOUR BODY IS ELEVATED AND RISEN UP; IT ENRAPTURES THE SPIRIT
WITH ITS JOY, THAT IT MAY BECOME CREATOR AND EVALUATOR AND LOVER AND
BENEFACTOR OF ALL THINGS.</p><p><br></p><p>The past has been an utter failure, because we created so-called
religious people, but we could not create the creators. And unless a
religious person contributes to the world through some creativity,</p><p>he has not known the ecstasy of his being; otherwise, he would have
shared it in a thousand and one ways – perhaps in music, perhaps in
dance, perhaps in song, perhaps in poetry. But he would have uttered it;
it would have overflowed him.</p><p><br></p><p>In my vision, the creators are more religious than the people who go
to the churches, to the temples, to the mosques, the people who do long
fasts, the people who torture their bodies, the people who go through
many kinds of austerities: these are a little bit crazy type of people –
off center. If the whole world becomes religious in their way, you will
find it turning into a madhouse. It has almost turned!</p><p><br></p><p>Just the other day, I was telling you about Vincent Van Gogh, the
famous Dutch painter, who could not sell a single painting in his life,
because nobody could understand the beauty of his paintings. He was too
far ahead of his times. And just today, Anando brought me a newsclipping
about one of his paintings of flowers, which has broken all the records
up to now. It has been sold for forty million dollars. Van Gogh died in
poverty, and finally became mad, because he had not enough to eat.</p><p><br></p><p>Rather than eating, he preferred to paint. So whatsoever he could
get, he would not eat, he would purchase paint, canvasses. And he would
paint, hungry, the whole day in the hot sun, standing when he was
painting. The hot sun and hunger drove him to madness. When he was
released from the madhouse after one year – because all that he needed
was rest, good food – he painted his last painting, and committed
suicide. He was only thirty-three.</p><p><br></p><p>And he wrote a letter to his brothers, “Don’t think that I am
committing suicide. I am not an escapist, but the reason that I am
leaving this world is that I cannot manage both my body and my
paintings. I have prolonged as long as it was possible; moreover, I have
painted the painting that I wanted to paint. I am dying completely
fulfilled, with no regret, with no complaint.”</p><p><br></p><p>And now, in that news cutting, in front of his painting there are
iron bars – because now it is worth forty million dollars – and two
constables standing with loaded guns to protect the painting, and nobody
gave even bread and butter to the painter.</p><p><br></p><p>I will call Van Gogh a saint, because life mistreated him as badly as
you can conceive. Yet in his last letter he has no complaint, no grudge;
and he’s dying utterly fulfilled, because whatever he wanted to do he
has done. He contributed some beauty to the world. He has contributed it
whether people understand it or not. “That is not my business; that is
their problem.” After one hundred years, now his paintings are being
searched out, because each painting has become so valuable, that even
the greatest painters are left far behind. This is the record: no
painting has been sold up to now for forty million dollars. And it is a
painting only of roses. You will not give forty million dollars for real
roses.</p><p><br></p><p>But in his whole life – I have read all his letters, that’s all that
he has written – there is not even a single place where he is angry, or
condemnatory, or in any way saying anything against the world. Again and
again he says, “I can understand. If they cannot see beauty in my
paintings, what can they do? Neither I can do anything, nor they can do
anything.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have come before my time; my paintings will have to wait for my
people to come. When my people are here, perhaps they will recognize
then, if my paintings survive.”</p><p>No museum was ready to take those paintings free. People were
ashamed; his friends were ashamed, because he used to give his friends
his paintings, these same paintings “... just to keep, because I don’t
have enough space. I live in a small room, I cannot pay more rent, and I
don’t have a space to keep all my paintings. So, just hang it on your
wall.” People would hang it on their wall, and the moment he was gone
they would throw it in their basement. “Anybody who comes here will
think we are mad because we cannot say what this painting means.”</p><p><br></p><p>All two hundred paintings have been found in people’s basements, in
strange places. And a great search goes on, because he has painted
thousands of paintings and distributed them to people, because he had no
place to keep them.</p><p><br></p><p>I will call this man a saint who lives the life of sacrifice; but
sacrifice not to some hypothetical god, sacrifice not to some wooden
statue, but sacrifice to share his joy, and his beauty, and his vision,
and his dreams. If the contemporary people cannot understand it, he is
ready to wait. He will not be here, but somebody, somewhere in the
future will understand it, will rejoice in it; and that is a good enough
reward.</p><p><br></p><p>Such trust in one’s own creativity, such trust that someday there
will be someone who is going to understand him – he cannot remain
misunderstood forever – can only be a quality of a saint, a true
sage.</p><p><br></p><p>WHEN YOUR HEART SURGES BROAD AND FULL LIKE A RIVER, A BLESSING AND A
DANGER TO THOSE WHO LIVE NEARBY: THAT IS WHEN YOUR VIRTUE HAS ITS
ORIGIN</p><p>AND BEGINNING. Zarathustra is saying a tremendously significant
thing. WHEN YOUR HEART SURGES BROAD AND FULL LIKE A RIVER, A BLESSING
AND A DANGER TO THOSE WHO</p><p>LIVE NEARBY. A man like Zarathustra is a blessing only to very few
people; only for those who are courageous enough to come close to him,
who are courageous enough to go with him into the unknown, on the
untrodden path, against tradition, against orthodoxies, against
conventions, against the crowd.</p><p><br></p><p>But to most of the people it is a danger. The very presence of a man
whose heart is overflowing like a river, with love, is a danger. His
love can drown you, his love can destroy your ego. To be close to such a
person is to lose your boundaries, your identity.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why such people are hated so much; so much that Socrates has
to be poisoned. He must have become a great danger to the people of
Athens. What danger can he be? His love, his truth, his individuality,
his overflowing bliss is as dangerous as a flood. Perhaps in a flood
there is a possibility that you can swim out; but once you are caught in
the flood of love, you cannot swim out.</p><p><br></p><p>Down the ages, people who have been really a blessing have been
thought to be curses. Only very few people, courageous, intelligent,
with guts, ready to risk, and ready to go on an adventure in deep trust
and love, knew their blessings; the others knew only their danger. And
it is better to destroy such dangerous people, because they can create
chaos in the whole society.</p><p><br></p><p>But the chaos created by a man like Zarathustra, Socrates, or Jesus
is a chaos out of which stars are born, is a chaos out of which man
reaches to higher peaks of evolution. The old is destroyed, and the new
is born. It is a chaos to be welcomed. But even now, the situation
remains exactly the same.</p><p>WHEN YOU ARE EXALTED ABOVE PRAISE AND BLAME, AND YOUR WILL WANTS TO
COMMAND ALL THINGS AS ETHE WILL OF A LOVER: THAT IS WHEN YOUR VIRTUE HAS
ITS ORIGIN AND BEGINNING.…</p><p><br></p><p>WHEN YOU ARE WILLERS OF A SINGLE WILL, AND YOU CALL THIS DISPELLER OF
NEED YOUR ESSENTIAL AND NECESSITY: THAT IS WHEN YOUR VIRTUE HAS ITS
ORIGIN AND BEGINNING.</p><p><br></p><p>TRULY, IT IS A NEW GOOD AND EVIL! TRULY, A NEW ROARING IN THE DEPTHS
AND THE VOICE OF A NEW FOUNTAIN!</p><p><br></p><p>IT IS POWER, THIS NEW VIRTUE: IT IS A RULING IDEA, AND AROUND IT A
SUBTLE SOUL: A GOLDEN SUN, AND AROUND IT THE SERPENT OF KNOWLEDGE.</p><p><br></p><p>Love is his central theme, is his God; and love is the beginning and
the origin of all virtue, and love is the essential need of everyone, to
dispel darkness and ignorance.</p><p><br></p><p>Love is a new morality, a new good, a new God.</p><p><br></p><p>TRULY A NEW ROARING IN THE DEPTHS AND THE VOICE OF A NEW
FOUNTAIN.</p><p><br></p><p>IT IS POWER, THIS NEW VIRTUE: IT IS A RULING IDEA, AND AROUND IT A

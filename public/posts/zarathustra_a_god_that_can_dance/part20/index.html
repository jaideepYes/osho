THUS ZARATHUSTRA TEACHES YOU.\nZARATHUSTRA IS A mine of original thoughts and extraordinary insights.\nGod has always been the creator of the world. Zarathustra wants to show that the very idea of a creator of the world destroys our freedom. We become creatures, and anything that is being created can be uncreated. It all depends on a whimsical God. The very hypothesis, the very supposition of God, is so absurd that it seems inconceivable how mankind could have lived with the idea for thousands of years.\nThe hypothesis of God creates more problems than it solves. It solves nothing – and a hypothesis is needed to solve problems. The hypothesis of God has only created a jungle of problems – all the theologies, all the religions, all the temples, churches, synagogues. And they are all based on such an irrational hypothesis – not only irrational, but inconceivable too.\nFor example, according to Christianity, God created the world exactly four thousand and four years before Jesus Christ was born. How have they managed to discover this figure – four thousand and four years before Jesus Christ – is anybody’s guess, because there could not have been any eyewitness. The very idea of there being an eyewitness means the world was already there.\nGod must have created the world without any witness. Then who is the man, and what right has he to bring this number of four thousand and four years? On what grounds? Christianity has not given any grounds. There is no possibility to give any grounds, and naturally the question arises of what God was doing before that? – because it is a very short period: from today it is only six thousand years. In the vast expanse of eternity, six thousand years mean nothing.\nAccording to scientific calculations, even this earth is four billion years old, our sun perhaps sixteen billion years old. And our sun is not the oldest star in the galaxy, nor the biggest; it is only a mediocre star.\nAnd against every belief, there have been discovered cities underneath the earth which are certainly seven thousand years old. And there have been found on the Himalayas, fossils of sea animals – which is a very strange thing. What were sea animals doing on the Himalayas? And they are nearly eighty thousand years old.\nThe conclusion is that eighty thousand years ago, where the Himalayas are today, there was an ocean. In some cataclysmic change the Himalayas arose, and the ocean went downwards. But many animals died in that cataclysm, and their dead bodies remained on the Himalayan peaks; otherwise, there is no way for them to reach there, they cannot come out of the ocean.\nIn China there has been found fifty-thousand-year-old human bodies, almost intact, because they were covered in snow, and the snow has never melted; it has preserved them.\nIn spite of all scientific evidence we cannot conceive the beginning of the world. In fact the very idea of the beginning seems to be stupid, because how can something begin when there is nothing? It means out of nothing something begins, and suddenly, for no reason at all. At a certain point of time, the creation begins.\nThe hypothesis of God has not helped in any way to make life more explainable. But nobody except Zarathustra has proposed a counter-hypothesis: “Forget about the god that created the world. He does not exist.”\nGod is not in the past, God has to be created in the future, God has to come as a crescendo of human consciousness, as the highest peak of human life, human awareness, human spirit. Each human being is carrying the seed of God. This seems to be more scientific, more in tune with the theory of Charles Darwin, the theory of evolution... God in the beginning is the most evolved phenomenon? God can only be in the end, the most evolved phenomenon, not in the beginning. God can be the ultimate purity, truth, love; the ultimate harmony and silence.\nZarathustra gives the greatest challenge ever given, when he says, “We have to create God.” His name for God is “superman.”\nZARATHUSTRA HAS RETURNED TO THE MOUNTAINS WHERE HE LIVES A SOLITARY EXISTENCE FOR MANY YEARS, UNTIL ONE MORNING HE HAS A DREAM. Human evolution\nowes everything to the dreamers, to the poets, to the mystics, to the visionaries... people who will be thought by their contemporaries crazy, eccentric, insane, because they are talking about things which have not happened yet. But their far-seeing eyes, their clarity of vision, has seen them. Someday, somewhere in the future, they are going to become realities; right now they are only dreams.\nAnd remember, these dreams are not the dreams of Sigmund Freud and his psychoanalysis. Sigmund Freud never came across any mystic, any visionary, any poet, so he knows only the dreams of the sick, psychologically disturbed, pathological people. And he has fallen into a very human fallacy. He thinks these are the only dreams that happen in the world.\nNaturally, in his experience he has come to know only sick people. A mystic will not go to Sigmund Freud for psychoanalysis, nor will a poet go, nor will a creator go. People go whose minds are deeply split, repressed, retarded; people who have not been able to live their lives fully – the unlived parts of their lives become their dreams.\nThese are not the true dreamers. Zarathustra is, Gautam Buddha is, Lao Tzu is. They have nothing to repress, they don’t have any inhibitions, they live their life moment to moment with totality; hence, no residue remains in their unconscious to become dreams. Their unconscious is a pure silence. Out of this silence, once in a while, they see the future, they see something happening far away.\nZarathustra was living a solitary existence in the mountains, until one morning he has a dream.\nFILLED WITH A NEW RESOLVE – the dream filled him with a new resolve – AND AN OVERWHELMING DESIRE TO SHARE HIS WORDS WITH HIS FRIENDS, ZARATHUSTRA SPEAKS THUS:\nBEHOLD, WHAT ABUNDANCE IS AROUND US! AND IT IS FINE TO GAZE OUT UPON DISTANT SEAS FROM THE MIDST OF SUPERFLUITY.\nONCE YOU SAID ‘GOD’ WHEN YOU GAZED UPON DISTANT SEAS; BUT NOW I HAVE TAUGHT YOU TO SAY ‘SUPERMAN’.\nThe distant destiny that once you used to call God was only an empty word, because it was not related in any way with you. There was no bridge between you and God. It was an image created by your fear. You felt alone in this vast universe, and you wanted a father-figure.\nIt is not strange that everywhere God is called “father.” In fact, we have all been brought up by fathers, protected, safe and secure. The idea of father has become a fixation in our mind, and we know this father is mortal – either he is dead or he is going to be dead. And then you will be left unprotected, without any security, with nobody to look up to. It is because of this fear, and for this security, that man has created “God the Father.”\nTwo small boys were playing and a bishop passed by. One boy was a Christian, and he said to the bishop, “Good morning, father.” The other boy was a Jew. He stood there wondering, and when the\nbishop was gone he said to the boy, “You are strange people. This man has no wife, no children, he is a celibate, and you call him ‘father’. You can be stupid – you are just a child – and call him father; but he accepts it; and he has not fathered anything in the world.”\nBut it is the same sort of security: the priest becomes the father, the God becomes the father. There are even people like the Germans... their country becomes “fatherland.” In the whole world, every country is a motherland except Germany. Perhaps it is below their egoistic attitude of being the most superior race in the world, having the birthright to rule over every other human being. Certainly, their country has to be not a woman, but a man. This is the male chauvinistic attitude.\nBut we are not alert. These things go on happening around us. Just the other day I was informed... because I don’t read; for ten years I have not read anything, any book, any newspaper, any magazine; only if my secretary comes across something, which I must be made aware of, she informs me.\nJust four or five years ago they found a screening system by which it can be scientifically known whether the child in the mother’s womb is a boy or a girl; because the boy gives a different kind of vibration from the girl, and the machine simply reads the vibrations.\nJust in Bombay – and it is spreading over all the third world countries – just in Bombay, women are going through that screening process, and if it is found that it is a girl and not a boy, then they go for abortion. Ninety-seven percent of abortions are of girls. Man is so stupid that he doesn’t understand a simple arithmetic. If ninety-seven percent of girls are to be killed, then the world will be much too full of men. It will create all kinds of sexual perversions, prostitution, homosexuality; or we may have to find scientific ways for people’s sexuality.\nBut nobody is bothered that this is very ugly, and if it is happening, the result will come soon, within a decade, all over the world, and then it will be too late. Even in the twentieth century, man remains crude, primitive, wants the woman only to be a slave; and this is the last step – it is pure murder.\nI am not against abortion, but nature keeps a balance. The same balance should be kept in abortions. It is the duty of the doctors and the hospitals that if fifty girls are aborted, then fifty boys should be aborted; otherwise, you are creating a great problem for the coming days. Ugly diseases are bound to spread.\nBut for centuries, man has been doing things which should not have been done. God has overruled humanity, and God is nothing but an idea. For this idea, millions of people have died; they killed each other, crusades upon crusades – Mohammedans killing Hindus, Christians killing Jews.\nYou can see it in India; Gautam Buddha influenced the whole country, but once he was dead, all the Buddhists simply disappeared. In the East, India is the only country which has no Buddhists. What happened? – Either they were killed, burnt alive, or they had to escape from India to Tibet, to Sri Lanka, to Japan, to China, to Korea, to Thailand, to faraway lands, just to survive. The whole of Asia is Buddhist, except India, and Buddhism was born in India. Is it not amazing?\nIndians go on bragging, “This is the country of Gautam Buddha.” And what have you done with the Buddhists? Even in the temple, which was raised in the memory of Gautam Buddha’s enlightenment\nin Bodhgaya, a brahmin who is not a buddhist, is the priest. For centuries his family, generation after generation, has supplied the priest. Now they are the owners of the temple and the land.\nBuddhists have been killed: it was such a massacre that not even a priest was available for the memorial temple that was raised for Buddha. Buddha’s whole effort was against brahminism, his revolution was against brahminism – and a brahmin is the priest in his temple.\nZarathustra is right: Don’t any longer call that distant vision God. That word has done enough harm. Let us say the superman – because superman is your growth. God is absolutely unrelated to you; superman is your heights, your depths, superman is your spring.\nSuperman is absolutely rooted in man, it will grow out of man. Hence, superman is not a hypothesis, it is a tremendously significant vision of man’s growth, a challenge for a pilgrimage. Move out of your smallness, move out of your meanness, move out of your hate, of your jealousies; and you will find yourself turning into a superman. Superman is nothing but you, refined, purified, fulfilled, using your intelligence in its totality.\nZarathustra is not talking a new theology. He is talking about the science of man.\nGOD IS A SUPPOSITION; BUT I WANT YOUR SUPPOSING TO REACH NO FURTHER THAN\nYOUR CREATING WILL. Drop all such suppositions. A supposed God is a false God.\nI am reminded.… In my school days in the arithmetic class, all the problems in arithmetic are “suppose” The very first day I came into conflict with the teacher. I said, “Why should I suppose?”\nHe looked at me and said, “I have taught thousands of students, and I am just going to be retired; nobody has ever said, ‘Why should I suppose?’ This is arithmetic.”\nI said, “Whatever it is, the question remains: you are asking me to suppose something, but why should I suppose – unnecessarily creating a problem – and then I have to solve it! I withdraw myself from the very beginning. I don’t suppose!”\nHe said, “Then you cannot learn arithmetic.”\nI said, “Most probably I will never need mathematics. Talk something of realitysupposition?\nEverything is supposition.” But the whole of theology is just a supposition – arithmetic is more honest, they use the word “suppose.” Theology is more dishonest. It does not say, “Suppose there is a God”; it says, “There is a God.”\nZarathustra says, “Your supposition should not go further than your creating will.” You have forgotten that you can create, that you have a will. Find it out, bring it forth, make it a reality. To you it may appear a supposition in the beginning, but to me it is a reality.\nThat’s why he is saying, I WANT YOUR SUPPOSING TO REACH NO FURTHER THAN YOUR\nCREATING WILL. That’s enough. The work of your supposing is finished.\nCOULD YOU CREATE A GOD? Certainly nobody has ever asked this. People have been asking whether God created us. Zarathustra is asking, COULD YOU CREATE A GOD? If you can create a god, then god becomes a reality. If you cannot create a god, that god remains a supposition.\nAnd we have been tortured by this supposition long enough. We have been enslaved by a hypothesis for thousands of years. Unless we destroy this hypothesis, man can never stand on his own feet. He can never be free. How can you be free? If you are just created by God, you are a puppet. Once he thought to create you – it was a whimsical idea. In the first place there was no need to create – or was there any need? He created you as a whim. But you cannot depend on such a whimsical person, he must be getting tired. One day he can destroy everything that he has created.\nIf you are just a creature then there is no point of talking about enlightenment, no point of talking about your realization, no point of talking about love, of freedom. You don’t matter any more. If God is a reality, you become false. It is a great choice to be made: either you choose yourself, or you can choose God; but choosing God means committing suicide as human beings.\nCOULD YOU CREATE A GOD? – SO BE SILENT ABOUT ALL GODS! BUT YOU COULD SURELY\nCREATE THE SUPERMAN. And that which you can create will bring joy to you, will make a god of you, because you will become a creator. This is a totally different approach. You are not to go in search of God – you will not find Him. You have to become a god. And to become a god means to create something higher than you, better than you, superior to you, which surpasses you in every way.\nPERHAPS NOT YOU YOURSELVES, MY BROTHERS! BUT YOU COULD TRANSFORM YOURSELVES INTO FOREFATHERS AND ANCESTORS OF THE SUPERMAN: AND LET THIS BE\nYOUR FINEST CREATING! Perhaps you yourself cannot create the superman, but you can create the situation. You can start the work. Perhaps after four generations the work will be completed – the superman will have arrived. You can at least be forefathers and ancestors of the superman – AND LET THIS BE YOUR FINEST CREATING!\nGOD IS A SUPPOSITION: BUT I WANT YOUR SUPPOSING TO BE BOUNDED BY\nCONCEIVABILITY. He is infinitely a sensible man. He says, “Your supposing should be bounded by conceivability.” You cannot even conceive God. If you try to figure out, “What do you mean by God?”, nothing will arise in your mind; or something will arise, which has been told to you from your very childhood, forced in your mind.\nJust in front of my house there used to be a temple, a beautiful temple. My father once said to me “I know, if I say to you ‘Come with me to the temple,’ then it is impossible. That’s why I am not inviting you. I am not saying ‘Come with me.’ I am leaving it up to you. It is a beautiful temple, it has a very beautiful statue of god – believe in it or not. But what is the harm to come and see?”\nI said, “Okay, I am coming, but then don’t be angry with me.”\nHe said, “Why should I be angry, I should be very happy that you are coming.”\nThen he prostrated himself before the god, and I laughed and he was angry and I said, “I have told you before that you will be angry.”\nHe said, “But why did you laugh?”\nI said, “You are prostrating yourself before a god, and I have seen rats pissing over the god. I am a constant visitor, but I don’t come when people come in the morning. I come in the afternoons when\nthere is nobody. This place is so silent, I can almost forget the world. I sit here silently, I enjoy; and I have seen rats running over the statue, pissing over the statue; and you are asking me why I am laughing?\n“A god who cannot protect himself from the rats is not going to protect you! Just get up. If the rats see it, what will they think of me? You are my father.”\nHe said, “Never come with me!”\nI said, “I have not come with you; you seduced me to come with you, you tricked me, and I warned you not to become angry because I knew that was going to happen.”\nHow many temples are there on the earth, of how many religions? And how many different kinds of gods have they imagined? And they will not even see the stupidity of their imagination. In India you will find thousands of gods. In this part of the land, Ganesha, the elephant god, is worshiped most. Even the very well-educated, professors in the university, and the vice-chancellors, they also worship it – and nobody ever thinks at all.\nI would like to tell you the story of Ganesh, just to make it clearHe is supposed to be the son of\nShiva, one of the Hindu trinity of gods. The Hindu god has three faces, it is called trimurti, just like the Christian trinity: one is Brahma who creates the world, the other is Vishnu who maintains it, and the third is Shiva who destroys it. This elephant god, Ganesha, has the body of a man, of a very ugly man because his belly is so big that he is all belly; and on top of it he has an elephant’s head.\nThe story is: Shiva has gone out, and his wife Parvati was taking a bath. It seems she has taken a bath only once in her life, because she collected all the dust from her body and made Ganesha. This elephant god is made by collecting all the dust.I have always wondered how thick the layer of dust\nwas, that she must have been carrying on her body. Just playfully taking a bath, cleaning her body, she collected the dust and made a statue of it. And because she is a goddess she breathed life into him. This is how he became the son of Parvati and Shiva – although Shiva has no contribution in it; he was not even aware that he has a son.\nShe told Ganesha, “You sit outside and don’t let anybody come in. If somebody comes, tell him, ‘My father is out. Come some other time.’” At that time he did not have the head of an elephant. But as chance would have it, Shiva himself came; and he prevented him with his sword, this little boy, and said, “Don’t come in, my father is out. Come some time later on.”\nShiva could not believe it: “Who is this fellow? Preventing ME!” He became so angry he took away the sword and cut off the head of the child, and went in and asked Parvati, “Who is that boy?”\nShe said, “What happened?” He said, “I have finished him.” She said, “You don’t know, he was your son.” And then she explained the whole thing, and she started throwing a tantrum: “Bring my son back!”\nSo he went out to look for the head.where the head has gone. They used to live on the Himalayas,\nso it must have rolled down somewhere into some valley, into pieces; just the boy was sitting without the head. So he ran around, found a small boy elephant; he cut off his head and glued that head on Ganesha.\nThese kinds of foolish things... and for thousands of years people go on worshiping.\nGod is beyond your conceivability. Whatever you can conceive will be just an idea. That’s why there are so many gods, because different people conceived them.\nHe is asking a very pertinent question, GOD IS A SUPPOSITION; BUT I WANT YOUR SUPPOSING TO BE BOUNDED BY CONCEIVABILITY. COULD YOU CONCEIVE A GOD? Forget about creating,\nyou cannot even conceive a god! All your conceptions will be just imaginary.\nBUT MAY THE WILL TO TRUTH MEAN THIS TO YOU: THAT EVERYTHING SHALL BE\nTRANSFORMED INTO THE HUMANLY-CONCEIVABLE..., he wants religion to be humanly- conceivable, not an absurdity,... THE HUMANLY-EVIDENT, THE HUMANLY-PALPABLE! YOU SHOULD FOLLOW YOUR OWN SENSES TO THE END! He is not against your senses, as all the religions are. He is all for them: they are your nature. They are windows through which you connect with existence. YOU SHOULD FOLLOW YOUR OWN SENSES TO THE END!\nThere is nothing like repression in the whole philosophy of Zarathustra. He is a pagan, a realist, a man who trusts in nature and existence.\nAND YOU YOURSELVES SHOULD CREATE WHAT YOU HAVE HITHERTO CALLED THE WORLD.\nBecause you lived under this false notion that God created the world, is why the world is in such a mess. Once God is removed, once the idea that God created the world is removed, then the responsibility falls on you.\nYou have to create the world.\nAnd then the world will be more human, more loving, more joyous, more dancing.\nAND YOU YOURSELVES SHOULD CREATE WHAT YOU HAVE HITHERTO CALLED THE WORLD: THE WORLD SHOULD BE FORMED IN YOUR IMAGE BY YOUR REASON, YOUR WILL, AND YOUR LOVE! AND TRULY, IT WILL BE TO YOUR HAPPINESS, YOU ENLIGHTENED MEN! Now\nagain he changes his address. If you have understood this much... and the people he must have been talking to, his disciples, must have shown indications that they have understood it. It is so simple, it is so natural, it does not ask you to believe in anything. It simply tries to make you aware of all your capacities of will, reason and love.\nAND TRULY, IT WILL BE TO YOUR HAPPINESS, YOU ENLIGHTENED MEN! If you can fall in\nrapport with Zarathustra’s approach, you have already become enlightened.\nBUT TO REVEAL MY HEART ENTIRELY TO YOU, FRIENDS: IF THERE WERE GODS, HOW COULD I ENDURE NOT TO BE A GOD! THEREFORE THERE ARE NO GODS A very beautiful\nargument, and a very strange one too. He is saying, “If there were gods, how could I endure not to be a god? How could you endure not to be a god? Because without being a god, you would always remain inferior, you will always remain a slave. No, it cannot be endured. God cannot be endured, cannot be tolerated.” This is a very psychological argument – not logical.\nTHEREFORE THERE ARE NO GODS. Because I don’t feel any inferiority, because I don’t feel any competition with any god, because I feel absolutely contented, fulfilled, I don’t see any need of God. In my health, in my joy, in my purity, in my holiness, I am so enriched. There is no question for me to be jealous of anyone else. Existence has given to me all that I could have ever dreamt.\nTHEREFORE THERE ARE NO GODS.\nI, INDEED, DREW THAT CONCLUSION; BUT NOW IT DRAWS ME.\nGOD IS A SUPPOSITION: BUT WHO COULD IMBIBE ALL THE ANGUISH OF THIS SUPPOSITION WITHOUT DYING? SHALL THE CREATOR BE ROBBED OF HIS FAITH AND THE EAGLE OF HIS SOARING INTO THE HEIGHTS?\nThe very idea that “God is” takes away from you everything that is valuable. Then your strings are in the hands of God. He wants you to fight – you fight. He wants you to love – you love. He wants you to live – you live. He wants you to die – you die. You are just a thing. Your life is not your own: he has breathed that life into you, he can take it back. You are living on borrowed life – it is humiliating.\nYou have, in the idea of God, destroyed the beauty of all the creators. You have taken away the soaring into the heights of the eagle; you have taken away the possibility of enlightenment of human beings; you have taken away the most cherished value of freedom. Just for a supposition, you have destroyed all that is beautiful in life. Zarathustra is ready to take away that supposition and give you your freedom, your creativity, your flight, your love, your godliness.\nOnce God is no more there, then this very earth can be transformed into a paradise, because then it is up to you how you want it to be. Your destiny is no more in somebody else’s hands. You are for the first time masters of your own life, of your destiny, of your distant future.\nI CALL IT EVIL AND MISANTHROPIC, ALL THIS TEACHING ABOUT THE ONE AND THE PERFECT AND THE UNMOVED AND THE SUFFICIENT AND THE INTRANSITORY. Great is\nthe courage of Zarathustra. He is saying, I CALL IT EVIL – what you call God, I CALL IT EVIL AND MISANTHROPIC. It is against humanity. It is very unkind, rude... ALL THIS TEACHING ABOUT THE ONE, AND THE PERFECT, AND THE UNMOVED, AND THE SUFFICIENT AND THE INTRANSITORY.\nBUT THE BEST IMAGES AND PARABLES SHOULD SPEAK OF TIME AND BECOMING: Forget\nall this nonsense. From now onwards, THE BEST IMAGES AND PARABLES SHOULD SPEAK OF TIME AND BECOMING.\nBecause we have accepted the idea that God created, there is no question of becoming. He has created dogs, he has created monkeys, he has created trees, he has created man: everybody is a being: becoming is out of question. Becoming will mean you can improve on the work of God. But once the supposition of God is removed, instead of being, becoming becomes our life.\nThen you are no more dirty water, unflowing, becoming dirtier and dirtier every day. You become a river, a flowing, a change, each moment bringing new life and new juices to you, new beauty and new grace.\nTHEY SHOULD BE A EULOGY AND A JUSTIFICATION OF ALL TRANSITORINESS. All that is\nchanging and changeable should be praised, not the permanent, because the permanent is always dead; the living is always moving. The living is always becoming, never being. Zarathustra teaches becoming instead of being, he teaches change instead of permanence.\nALL FEELING SUFFERS IN ME AND IS IN PRISON: BUT MY WILLING ALWAYS COMES TO ME AS MY LIBERATOR AND BRINGER OF JOY.\nWILLING LIBERATES: THAT IS THE TRUE DOCTRINE OF WILL AND FREEDOM – THUS ZARATHUSTRA TEACHES YOU.\nBecoming implies willing. You have to will, you have to create yourself every moment. The responsibility is no more on some hypothetical God. The responsibility is on your own shoulders. You cannot complain against any fate. If you are miserable, you are responsible. If you are joyful, if you are blissful, it is your will, it is your creation.\nZarathustra raises willing to the highest creative quality in man. You can will this earth to become a paradise. You can will this man to become superman; your will is the greatest power in your hands.\nBut people have lived not as “willers,” but as “sufferers of feeling.” The feeling is something for which somebody else is responsible – somebody insults you and you feel anger. Somebody praises you and you feel joy. A lottery comes up in your name, and you dance. Feeling is a dependability. Somebody else from outside is needed to do something. Something has to happen to you.\nThat’s why Zarathustra calls out :ALL feeling SUFFERS IN ME AND IS IN PRISON. But my willing is a totally different matter: MY willing ALWAYS COMES TO ME AS MY LIBERATOR AND BRINGER OF JOY. Willing liberates – because willing makes you creators, willing makes you gods. Willing transforms you into superman.\n... THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA.\nOkay, Maneesha?\nYes, Osho.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"5404","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/zarathustra_a_god_that_can_dance/part20/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/zarathustra_a_god_that_can_dance/>Zarathustra.

COMES TO ME AS MY LIBERATOR AND BRINGER OF JOY.</p><p><br></p><p>WILLING LIBERATES: THAT IS THE TRUE DOCTRINE OF WILL AND FREEDOM.</p><p><br></p><p>... THUS ZARATHUSTRA TEACHES YOU.</p><p><br></p><p>ZARATHUSTRA IS A mine of original thoughts and extraordinary
insights.</p><p><br></p><p>God has always been the creator of the world. Zarathustra wants to
show that the very idea of a creator of the world destroys our freedom.
We become creatures, and anything that is being created can be
uncreated. It all depends on a whimsical God. The very hypothesis, the
very supposition of God, is so absurd that it seems inconceivable how
mankind could have lived with the idea for thousands of years.</p><p><br></p><p>The hypothesis of God creates more problems than it solves. It solves
nothing – and a hypothesis is needed to solve problems. The hypothesis
of God has only created a jungle of problems – all the theologies, all
the religions, all the temples, churches, synagogues. And they are all
based on such an irrational hypothesis – not only irrational, but
inconceivable too.</p><p>For example, according to Christianity, God created the world exactly
four thousand and four years before Jesus Christ was born. How have they
managed to discover this figure – four thousand and four years before
Jesus Christ – is anybody’s guess, because there could not have been any
eyewitness. The very idea of there being an eyewitness means the world
was already there.</p><p><br></p><p>God must have created the world without any witness. Then who is the
man, and what right has he to bring this number of four thousand and
four years? On what grounds? Christianity has not given any grounds.
There is no possibility to give any grounds, and naturally the question
arises of what God was doing before that? – because it is a very short
period: from today it is only six thousand years. In the vast expanse of
eternity, six thousand years mean nothing.</p><p><br></p><p>According to scientific calculations, even this earth is four billion
years old, our sun perhaps sixteen billion years old. And our sun is not
the oldest star in the galaxy, nor the biggest; it is only a mediocre
star.</p><p><br></p><p>And against every belief, there have been discovered cities
underneath the earth which are certainly seven thousand years old. And
there have been found on the Himalayas, fossils of sea animals – which
is a very strange thing. What were sea animals doing on the Himalayas?
And they are nearly eighty thousand years old.</p><p><br></p><p>The conclusion is that eighty thousand years ago, where the Himalayas
are today, there was an ocean. In some cataclysmic change the Himalayas
arose, and the ocean went downwards. But many animals died in that
cataclysm, and their dead bodies remained on the Himalayan peaks;
otherwise, there is no way for them to reach there, they cannot come out
of the ocean.</p><p><br></p><p>In China there has been found fifty-thousand-year-old human bodies,
almost intact, because they were covered in snow, and the snow has never
melted; it has preserved them.</p><p><br></p><p>In spite of all scientific evidence we cannot conceive the beginning
of the world. In fact the very idea of the beginning seems to be stupid,
because how can something begin when there is nothing? It means out of
nothing something begins, and suddenly, for no reason at all. At a
certain point of time, the creation begins.</p><p><br></p><p>The hypothesis of God has not helped in any way to make life more
explainable. But nobody except Zarathustra has proposed a
counter-hypothesis: “Forget about the god that created the world. He
does not exist.”</p><p><br></p><p>God is not in the past, God has to be created in the future, God has
to come as a crescendo of human consciousness, as the highest peak of
human life, human awareness, human spirit. Each human being is carrying
the seed of God. This seems to be more scientific, more in tune with the
theory of Charles Darwin, the theory of evolution... God in the
beginning is the most evolved phenomenon? God can only be in the end,
the most evolved phenomenon, not in the beginning. God can be the
ultimate purity, truth, love; the ultimate harmony and silence.</p><p><br></p><p>Zarathustra gives the greatest challenge ever given, when he says,
“We have to create God.” His name for God is “superman.”</p><p>ZARATHUSTRA HAS RETURNED TO THE MOUNTAINS WHERE HE LIVES A SOLITARY
EXISTENCE FOR MANY YEARS, UNTIL ONE MORNING HE HAS A DREAM. Human
evolution</p><p>owes everything to the dreamers, to the poets, to the mystics, to the
visionaries... people who will be thought by their contemporaries crazy,
eccentric, insane, because they are talking about things which have not
happened yet. But their far-seeing eyes, their clarity of vision, has
seen them. Someday, somewhere in the future, they are going to become
realities; right now they are only dreams.</p><p><br></p><p>And remember, these dreams are not the dreams of Sigmund Freud and
his psychoanalysis. Sigmund Freud never came across any mystic, any
visionary, any poet, so he knows only the dreams of the sick,
psychologically disturbed, pathological people. And he has fallen into a
very human fallacy. He thinks these are the only dreams that happen in
the world.</p><p><br></p><p>Naturally, in his experience he has come to know only sick people. A
mystic will not go to Sigmund Freud for psychoanalysis, nor will a poet
go, nor will a creator go. People go whose minds are deeply split,
repressed, retarded; people who have not been able to live their lives
fully – the unlived parts of their lives become their dreams.</p><p><br></p><p>These are not the true dreamers. Zarathustra is, Gautam Buddha is,
Lao Tzu is. They have nothing to repress, they don’t have any
inhibitions, they live their life moment to moment with totality; hence,
no residue remains in their unconscious to become dreams. Their
unconscious is a pure silence. Out of this silence, once in a while,
they see the future, they see something happening far away.</p><p><br></p><p>Zarathustra was living a solitary existence in the mountains, until
one morning he has a dream.</p><p><br></p><p>FILLED WITH A NEW RESOLVE – the dream filled him with a new resolve –
AND AN OVERWHELMING DESIRE TO SHARE HIS WORDS WITH HIS FRIENDS,
ZARATHUSTRA SPEAKS THUS:</p><p><br></p><p>BEHOLD, WHAT ABUNDANCE IS AROUND US! AND IT IS FINE TO GAZE OUT UPON
DISTANT SEAS FROM THE MIDST OF SUPERFLUITY.</p><p><br></p><p>ONCE YOU SAID ‘GOD’ WHEN YOU GAZED UPON DISTANT SEAS; BUT NOW I HAVE
TAUGHT YOU TO SAY ‘SUPERMAN’.</p><p><br></p><p>The distant destiny that once you used to call God was only an empty
word, because it was not related in any way with you. There was no
bridge between you and God. It was an image created by your fear. You
felt alone in this vast universe, and you wanted a father-figure.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not strange that everywhere God is called “father.” In fact, we
have all been brought up by fathers, protected, safe and secure. The
idea of father has become a fixation in our mind, and we know this
father is mortal – either he is dead or he is going to be dead. And then
you will be left unprotected, without any security, with nobody to look
up to. It is because of this fear, and for this security, that man has
created “God the Father.”</p><p><br></p><p>Two small boys were playing and a bishop passed by. One boy was a
Christian, and he said to the bishop, “Good morning, father.” The other
boy was a Jew. He stood there wondering, and when the</p><p>bishop was gone he said to the boy, “You are strange people. This man
has no wife, no children, he is a celibate, and you call him ‘father’.
You can be stupid – you are just a child – and call him father; but he
accepts it; and he has not fathered anything in the world.”</p><p><br></p><p>But it is the same sort of security: the priest becomes the father,
the God becomes the father. There are even people like the Germans...
their country becomes “fatherland.” In the whole world, every country is
a motherland except Germany. Perhaps it is below their egoistic attitude
of being the most superior race in the world, having the birthright to
rule over every other human being. Certainly, their country has to be
not a woman, but a man. This is the male chauvinistic attitude.</p><p><br></p><p>But we are not alert. These things go on happening around us. Just
the other day I was informed... because I don’t read; for ten years I
have not read anything, any book, any newspaper, any magazine; only if
my secretary comes across something, which I must be made aware of, she
informs me.</p><p><br></p><p>Just four or five years ago they found a screening system by which it
can be scientifically known whether the child in the mother’s womb is a
boy or a girl; because the boy gives a different kind of vibration from
the girl, and the machine simply reads the vibrations.</p><p><br></p><p>Just in Bombay – and it is spreading over all the third world
countries – just in Bombay, women are going through that screening
process, and if it is found that it is a girl and not a boy, then they
go for abortion. Ninety-seven percent of abortions are of girls. Man is
so stupid that he doesn’t understand a simple arithmetic. If
ninety-seven percent of girls are to be killed, then the world will be
much too full of men. It will create all kinds of sexual perversions,
prostitution, homosexuality; or we may have to find scientific ways for
people’s sexuality.</p><p><br></p><p>But nobody is bothered that this is very ugly, and if it is
happening, the result will come soon, within a decade, all over the
world, and then it will be too late. Even in the twentieth century, man
remains crude, primitive, wants the woman only to be a slave; and this
is the last step – it is pure murder.</p><p><br></p><p>I am not against abortion, but nature keeps a balance. The same
balance should be kept in abortions. It is the duty of the doctors and
the hospitals that if fifty girls are aborted, then fifty boys should be
aborted; otherwise, you are creating a great problem for the coming
days. Ugly diseases are bound to spread.</p><p><br></p><p>But for centuries, man has been doing things which should not have
been done. God has overruled humanity, and God is nothing but an idea.
For this idea, millions of people have died; they killed each other,
crusades upon crusades – Mohammedans killing Hindus, Christians killing
Jews.</p><p><br></p><p>You can see it in India; Gautam Buddha influenced the whole country,
but once he was dead, all the Buddhists simply disappeared. In the East,
India is the only country which has no Buddhists. What happened? –
Either they were killed, burnt alive, or they had to escape from India
to Tibet, to Sri Lanka, to Japan, to China, to Korea, to Thailand, to
faraway lands, just to survive. The whole of Asia is Buddhist, except
India, and Buddhism was born in India. Is it not amazing?</p><p><br></p><p>Indians go on bragging, “This is the country of Gautam Buddha.” And
what have you done with the Buddhists? Even in the temple, which was
raised in the memory of Gautam Buddha’s enlightenment</p><p>in Bodhgaya, a brahmin who is not a buddhist, is the priest. For
centuries his family, generation after generation, has supplied the
priest. Now they are the owners of the temple and the land.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddhists have been killed: it was such a massacre that not even a
priest was available for the memorial temple that was raised for Buddha.
Buddha’s whole effort was against brahminism, his revolution was against
brahminism – and a brahmin is the priest in his temple.</p><p><br></p><p>Zarathustra is right: Don’t any longer call that distant vision God.
That word has done enough harm. Let us say the superman – because
superman is your growth. God is absolutely unrelated to you; superman is
your heights, your depths, superman is your spring.</p><p><br></p><p>Superman is absolutely rooted in man, it will grow out of man. Hence,
superman is not a hypothesis, it is a tremendously significant vision of
man’s growth, a challenge for a pilgrimage. Move out of your smallness,
move out of your meanness, move out of your hate, of your jealousies;
and you will find yourself turning into a superman. Superman is nothing
but you, refined, purified, fulfilled, using your intelligence in its
totality.</p><p><br></p><p>Zarathustra is not talking a new theology. He is talking about the
science of man.</p><p><br></p><p>GOD IS A SUPPOSITION; BUT I WANT YOUR SUPPOSING TO REACH NO FURTHER
THAN</p><p>YOUR CREATING WILL. Drop all such suppositions. A supposed God is a
false God.</p><p><br></p><p>I am reminded.… In my school days in the arithmetic class, all the
problems in arithmetic are “suppose<span class=s4></span>” The very
first day I came into conflict with the teacher. I said, “Why should I
suppose?”</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at me and said, “I have taught thousands of students, and I
am just going to be retired; nobody has ever said, ‘Why should I
suppose?’ This is arithmetic.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Whatever it is, the question remains: you are asking me to
suppose something, but why should I suppose – unnecessarily creating a
problem – and then I have to solve it! I withdraw myself from the very
beginning. I don’t suppose!”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Then you cannot learn arithmetic.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Most probably I will never need mathematics. Talk something
of reality<span class=s4></span>supposition?</p><p>Everything is supposition.” But the whole of theology is just a
supposition – arithmetic is more honest, they use the word “suppose.”
Theology is more dishonest. It does not say, “Suppose there is a God”;
it says, “There is a God.”</p><p><br></p><p>Zarathustra says, “Your supposition should not go further than your
creating will.” You have forgotten that you can create, that you have a
will. Find it out, bring it forth, make it a reality. To you it may
appear a supposition in the beginning, but to me it is a reality.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why he is saying, I WANT YOUR SUPPOSING TO REACH NO FURTHER
THAN YOUR</p><p>CREATING WILL. That’s enough. The work of your supposing is
finished.</p><p><br></p><p>COULD YOU CREATE A GOD? Certainly nobody has ever asked this. People
have been asking whether God created us. Zarathustra is asking, COULD
YOU CREATE A GOD? If you can create a god, then god becomes a reality.
If you cannot create a god, that god remains a supposition.</p><p>And we have been tortured by this supposition long enough. We have
been enslaved by a hypothesis for thousands of years. Unless we destroy
this hypothesis, man can never stand on his own feet. He can never be
free. How can you be free? If you are just created by God, you are a
puppet. Once he thought to create you – it was a whimsical idea. In the
first place there was no need to create – or was there any need? He
created you as a whim. But you cannot depend on such a whimsical person,
he must be getting tired. One day he can destroy everything that he has
created.</p><p><br></p><p>If you are just a creature then there is no point of talking about
enlightenment, no point of talking about your realization, no point of
talking about love, of freedom. You don’t matter any more. If God is a
reality, you become false. It is a great choice to be made: either you
choose yourself, or you can choose God; but choosing God means
committing suicide as human beings.</p><p><br></p><p>COULD YOU CREATE A GOD? – SO BE SILENT ABOUT ALL GODS! BUT YOU COULD
SURELY</p><p>CREATE THE SUPERMAN. And that which you can create will bring joy to
you, will make a god of you, because you will become a creator. This is
a totally different approach. You are not to go in search of God – you
will not find Him. You have to become a god. And to become a god means
to create something higher than you, better than you, superior to you,
which surpasses you in every way.</p><p><br></p><p>PERHAPS NOT YOU YOURSELVES, MY BROTHERS! BUT YOU COULD TRANSFORM
YOURSELVES INTO FOREFATHERS AND ANCESTORS OF THE SUPERMAN: AND LET THIS
BE</p><p>YOUR FINEST CREATING! Perhaps you yourself cannot create the
superman, but you can create the situation. You can start the work.
Perhaps after four generations the work will be completed – the superman
will have arrived. You can at least be forefathers and ancestors of the
superman – AND LET THIS BE YOUR FINEST CREATING!</p><p><br></p><p>GOD IS A SUPPOSITION: BUT I WANT YOUR SUPPOSING TO BE BOUNDED BY</p><p>CONCEIVABILITY. He is infinitely a sensible man. He says, “Your
supposing should be bounded by conceivability.” You cannot even conceive
God. If you try to figure out, “What do you mean by God?”, nothing will
arise in your mind; or something will arise, which has been told to you
from your very childhood, forced in your mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Just in front of my house there used to be a temple, a beautiful
temple. My father once said to me “I know, if I say to you ‘Come with me
to the temple,’ then it is impossible. That’s why I am not inviting you.
I am not saying ‘Come with me.’ I am leaving it up to you. It is a
beautiful temple, it has a very beautiful statue of god – believe in it
or not. But what is the harm to come and see?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Okay, I am coming, but then don’t be angry with me.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Why should I be angry, I should be very happy that you are
coming.”</p><p><br></p><p>Then he prostrated himself before the god, and I laughed and he was
angry and I said, “I have told you before that you will be angry.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “But why did you laugh?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “You are prostrating yourself before a god, and I have seen
rats pissing over the god. I am a constant visitor, but I don’t come
when people come in the morning. I come in the afternoons when</p><p>there is nobody. This place is so silent, I can almost forget the
world. I sit here silently, I enjoy; and I have seen rats running over
the statue, pissing over the statue; and you are asking me why I am
laughing?</p><p><br></p><p>“A god who cannot protect himself from the rats is not going to
protect you! Just get up. If the rats see it, what will they think of
me? You are my father.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Never come with me!”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I have not come with you; you seduced me to come with you,
you tricked me, and I warned you not to become angry because I knew that
was going to happen.”</p><p><br></p><p>How many temples are there on the earth, of how many religions? And
how many different kinds of gods have they imagined? And they will not
even see the stupidity of their imagination. In India you will find
thousands of gods. In this part of the land, Ganesha, the elephant god,
is worshiped most. Even the very well-educated, professors in the
university, and the vice-chancellors, they also worship it – and nobody
ever thinks at all.</p><p><br></p><p>I would like to tell you the story of Ganesh, just to make it
clear<span class=s4></span>He is supposed to be the son of</p><p>Shiva, one of the Hindu trinity of gods. The Hindu god has three
faces, it is called trimurti, just like the Christian trinity: one is
Brahma who creates the world, the other is Vishnu who maintains it, and
the third is Shiva who destroys it. This elephant god, Ganesha, has the
body of a man, of a very ugly man because his belly is so big that he is
all belly; and on top of it he has an elephant’s head.</p><p><br></p><p>The story is: Shiva has gone out, and his wife Parvati was taking a
bath. It seems she has taken a bath only once in her life, because she
collected all the dust from her body and made Ganesha. This elephant god
is made by collecting all the dust.<span class=s4></span>I have always
wondered how thick the layer of dust</p><p>was, that she must have been carrying on her body. Just playfully
taking a bath, cleaning her body, she collected the dust and made a
statue of it. And because she is a goddess she breathed life into him.
This is how he became the son of Parvati and Shiva – although Shiva has
no contribution in it; he was not even aware that he has a son.</p><p><br></p><p>She told Ganesha, “You sit outside and don’t let anybody come in. If
somebody comes, tell him, ‘My father is out. Come some other time.’” At
that time he did not have the head of an elephant. But as chance would
have it, Shiva himself came; and he prevented him with his sword, this
little boy, and said, “Don’t come in, my father is out. Come some time
later on.”</p><p><br></p><p>Shiva could not believe it: “Who is this fellow? Preventing ME!” He
became so angry he took away the sword and cut off the head of the
child, and went in and asked Parvati, “Who is that boy?”</p><p><br></p><p>She said, “What happened?” He said, “I have finished him.” She said,
“You don’t know, he was your son.” And then she explained the whole
thing, and she started throwing a tantrum: “Bring my son back!”</p><p><br></p><p>So he went out to look for the head.<span class=s4></span>where the
head has gone. They used to live on the Himalayas,</p><p>so it must have rolled down somewhere into some valley, into pieces;
just the boy was sitting without the head. So he ran around, found a
small boy elephant; he cut off his head and glued that head on
Ganesha.</p><p>These kinds of foolish things... and for thousands of years people go
on worshiping.</p><p><br></p><p>God is beyond your conceivability. Whatever you can conceive will be
just an idea. That’s why there are so many gods, because different
people conceived them.</p><p><br></p><p>He is asking a very pertinent question, GOD IS A SUPPOSITION; BUT I
WANT YOUR SUPPOSING TO BE BOUNDED BY CONCEIVABILITY. COULD YOU CONCEIVE
A GOD? Forget about creating,</p><p>you cannot even conceive a god! All your conceptions will be just
imaginary.</p><p><br></p><p>BUT MAY THE WILL TO TRUTH MEAN THIS TO YOU: THAT EVERYTHING SHALL
BE</p><p>TRANSFORMED INTO THE HUMANLY-CONCEIVABLE..., he wants religion to be
humanly- conceivable, not an absurdity,... THE HUMANLY-EVIDENT, THE
HUMANLY-PALPABLE! YOU SHOULD FOLLOW YOUR OWN SENSES TO THE END! He is
not against your senses, as all the religions are. He is all for them:
they are your nature. They are windows through which you connect with
existence. YOU SHOULD FOLLOW YOUR OWN SENSES TO THE END!</p><p><br></p><p>There is nothing like repression in the whole philosophy of
Zarathustra. He is a pagan, a realist, a man who trusts in nature and
existence.</p><p>AND YOU YOURSELVES SHOULD CREATE WHAT YOU HAVE HITHERTO CALLED THE
WORLD.</p><p>Because you lived under this false notion that God created the world,
is why the world is in such a mess. Once God is removed, once the idea
that God created the world is removed, then the responsibility falls on
you.</p><p><br></p><p>You have to create the world.</p><p><br></p><p>And then the world will be more human, more loving, more joyous, more
dancing.</p><p><br></p><p>AND YOU YOURSELVES SHOULD CREATE WHAT YOU HAVE HITHERTO CALLED THE
WORLD: THE WORLD SHOULD BE FORMED IN YOUR IMAGE BY YOUR REASON, YOUR
WILL, AND YOUR LOVE! AND TRULY, IT WILL BE TO YOUR HAPPINESS, YOU
ENLIGHTENED MEN! Now</p><p>again he changes his address. If you have understood this much... and
the people he must have been talking to, his disciples, must have shown
indications that they have understood it. It is so simple, it is so
natural, it does not ask you to believe in anything. It simply tries to
make you aware of all your capacities of will, reason and love.</p><p><br></p><p>AND TRULY, IT WILL BE TO YOUR HAPPINESS, YOU ENLIGHTENED MEN! If you
can fall in</p><p>rapport with Zarathustra’s approach, you have already become
enlightened.</p><p><br></p><p>BUT TO REVEAL MY HEART ENTIRELY TO YOU, FRIENDS: IF THERE WERE GODS,
HOW COULD I ENDURE NOT TO BE A GOD! THEREFORE THERE ARE NO GODS A very
beautiful</p><p>argument, and a very strange one too. He is saying, “If there were
gods, how could I endure not to be a god? How could you endure not to be
a god? Because without being a god, you would always remain inferior,
you will always remain a slave. No, it cannot be endured. God cannot be
endured, cannot be tolerated.” This is a very psychological argument –
not logical.</p><p>THEREFORE THERE ARE NO GODS. Because I don’t feel any inferiority,
because I don’t feel any competition with any god, because I feel
absolutely contented, fulfilled, I don’t see any need of God. In my
health, in my joy, in my purity, in my holiness, I am so enriched. There
is no question for me to be jealous of anyone else. Existence has given
to me all that I could have ever dreamt.</p><p><br></p><p>THEREFORE THERE ARE NO GODS.</p><p><br></p><p>I, INDEED, DREW THAT CONCLUSION; BUT NOW IT DRAWS ME.</p><p><br></p><p>GOD IS A SUPPOSITION: BUT WHO COULD IMBIBE ALL THE ANGUISH OF THIS
SUPPOSITION WITHOUT DYING? SHALL THE CREATOR BE ROBBED OF HIS FAITH AND
THE EAGLE OF HIS SOARING INTO THE HEIGHTS?</p><p><br></p><p>The very idea that “God is” takes away from you everything that is
valuable. Then your strings are in the hands of God. He wants you to
fight – you fight. He wants you to love – you love. He wants you to live
– you live. He wants you to die – you die. You are just a thing. Your
life is not your own: he has breathed that life into you, he can take it
back. You are living on borrowed life – it is humiliating.</p><p><br></p><p>You have, in the idea of God, destroyed the beauty of all the
creators. You have taken away the soaring into the heights of the eagle;
you have taken away the possibility of enlightenment of human beings;
you have taken away the most cherished value of freedom. Just for a
supposition, you have destroyed all that is beautiful in life.
Zarathustra is ready to take away that supposition and give you your
freedom, your creativity, your flight, your love, your godliness.</p><p><br></p><p>Once God is no more there, then this very earth can be transformed
into a paradise, because then it is up to you how you want it to be.
Your destiny is no more in somebody else’s hands. You are for the first
time masters of your own life, of your destiny, of your distant
future.</p><p><br></p><p>I CALL IT EVIL AND MISANTHROPIC, ALL THIS TEACHING ABOUT THE ONE AND
THE PERFECT AND THE UNMOVED AND THE SUFFICIENT AND THE INTRANSITORY.
Great is</p><p>the courage of Zarathustra. He is saying, I CALL IT EVIL – what you
call God, I CALL IT EVIL AND MISANTHROPIC. It is against humanity. It is
very unkind, rude... ALL THIS TEACHING ABOUT THE ONE, AND THE PERFECT,
AND THE UNMOVED, AND THE SUFFICIENT AND THE INTRANSITORY.</p><p><br></p><p>BUT THE BEST IMAGES AND PARABLES SHOULD SPEAK OF TIME AND BECOMING:
Forget</p><p>all this nonsense. From now onwards, THE BEST IMAGES AND PARABLES
SHOULD SPEAK OF TIME AND BECOMING.</p><p><br></p><p>Because we have accepted the idea that God created, there is no
question of becoming. He has created dogs, he has created monkeys, he
has created trees, he has created man: everybody is a being: becoming is
out of question. Becoming will mean you can improve on the work of God.
But once the supposition of God is removed, instead of being, becoming
becomes our life.</p><p><br></p><p>Then you are no more dirty water, unflowing, becoming dirtier and
dirtier every day. You become a river, a flowing, a change, each moment
bringing new life and new juices to you, new beauty and new grace.</p><p>THEY SHOULD BE A EULOGY AND A JUSTIFICATION OF ALL TRANSITORINESS.
All that is</p><p>changing and changeable should be praised, not the permanent, because
the permanent is always dead; the living is always moving. The living is
always becoming, never being. Zarathustra teaches becoming instead of
being, he teaches change instead of permanence.</p><p><br></p><p>ALL FEELING SUFFERS IN ME AND IS IN PRISON: BUT MY WILLING ALWAYS
COMES TO ME AS MY LIBERATOR AND BRINGER OF JOY.</p><p><br></p><p>WILLING LIBERATES: THAT IS THE TRUE DOCTRINE OF WILL AND FREEDOM –
THUS ZARATHUSTRA TEACHES YOU.</p><p><br></p><p>Becoming implies willing. You have to will, you have to create
yourself every moment. The responsibility is no more on some
hypothetical God. The responsibility is on your own shoulders. You
cannot complain against any fate. If you are miserable, you are
responsible. If you are joyful, if you are blissful, it is your will, it
is your creation.</p><p><br></p><p>Zarathustra raises willing to the highest creative quality in man.
You can will this earth to become a paradise. You can will this man to
become superman; your will is the greatest power in your hands.</p><p><br></p><p>But people have lived not as “willers,” but as “sufferers of
feeling.” The feeling is something for which somebody else is
responsible – somebody insults you and you feel anger. Somebody praises
you and you feel joy. A lottery comes up in your name, and you dance.
Feeling is a dependability. Somebody else from outside is needed to do
something. Something has to happen to you.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why Zarathustra calls out :ALL feeling SUFFERS IN ME AND IS IN
PRISON. But my willing is a totally different matter: MY willing ALWAYS
COMES TO ME AS MY LIBERATOR AND BRINGER OF JOY. Willing liberates –
because willing makes you creators, willing makes you gods. Willing
transforms you into superman.</p><p><br></p><p>... THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA.</p><p><br></p><p>Okay, Maneesha?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, Osho.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part19>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

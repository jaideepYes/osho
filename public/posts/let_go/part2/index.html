It means absolute surrender, utter let-go. The mind is always in conflict with something or other; it needs conflict to exist. It can exist only in conflict and through conflict. It is a constant war, it is violence. It either fights with others or it starts fighting with itself, but one thing is certain about it, that it cannot exist without fight. It is its very breath.\nThe moment you stop fighting the mind starts disappearing on its own accord, and the disappearance of the mind is the appearance of God. The disappearance of the mind is the disappearance of you, you as an entity separate from the whole. Then the whole takes possession of you, you are overflooded with the whole. And that experience of being overflooded with the whole is the search. Call it satori, samadhi, enlightenment, realisation, liberation, salvation – those are just words, they describe only aspects of it. No word can actually describe it, it is beyond words! It is a taste, a flavour.\nWe can name a flavour but we cannot describe it. For example, vanilla: you can name it but you cannot describe it. It is an experience, the name is only an indicator. So is the case with samadhi, enlightenment, God; these are just names given to some tremendous experience – the experience when the experiencer is no more. That’s why it is tremendous, because it is not confined by any limitation. There is no observer in it, no knower in it. It is pure knowledge, it is sheer experience; the experiencer itself has dissolved into it.\nAnd the way to it is surrender. Stop fighting. And to stop fighting just an understanding is needed, because it creates misery, it never brings bliss. So to stop it is not a problem. The only problem is to understand it, to understand how we are creating our own misery. The ego is a self-created hell. The mind is our own creation and it is a nightmare, a constant on-going nightmare.\nWhen the mind is no more, for the first time one realises how beautiful life is, what a benediction, what a blessing. Then celebration starts. Learn to be in a let-go.\n... Remain in a let-go, remain very passive and receptive. Just be, with no idea of becoming, and then great things start happening. They never happen to seekers, they only happen to those who know how to rest, how not to seek, how not to search, how not to grope. Seek and you will miss. Do not seek and find!\n[Osho touches an initiates third eye and says he has a beautiful third eye!]\nIt is almost pulsating as if it is very alive. It is just throbbing like a pulse. Very rarely is so much energy there, and that can be of great help. Ordinarily energy exists on lower centres. In the majority it exists at the sex centre; that is the first centre. This is the sixth centre: only one step and the seventh arises. The journey is not long for you. You must have worked in your past lives. You may have completely forgotten but the body remembers. The body was not there, this body is new, but whenever we die in one life we carry the blueprint; according to that blueprint the new body starts functioning. We carry the psychology, the energy, and the energy remembers.\nYou can hope for great changes; much is possible and very easily – just a little effort. Move with that confidence and things will be very easy. When we know that something is possible, it becomes even more possible than it was before. When we think something is impossible, it may not be impossible but the very idea that it is impossible makes it so because we become hopeless about it. We know from the very beginning that it is not going to happen so we don’t put our total energy into it. When we know it is going to happen, when we know it is bound to happen, then the whole energy starts moving towards it. And with that confidence, with that trust, life starts taking a direction.\nSo growth is going to be very smooth for you. Remember it!\nVeet means beyond, Vikalpo means alternatives – beyond alternatives. The meaning is: don’t choose, remain choiceless. The mind is a chooser – it always chooses something against something else. It creates Opposition, it creates contradiction in life, it creates extremes, and through extremes there is constant war, inner war, a civil war.\nWhenever you choose, you are choosing something in which you are not total, otherwise there would have been no question of choice. When you choose, that means one part of the mind wanted the other and one part wanted this; now the major part has won. All choices are a kind of parliamentary decision. But the minority which was not agreeing is there and it will take revenge, it will fight back. Whenever there is a possibility for it to become the majority, it will throw the old decision away and will move just to the opposite extreme. That’s how people go on moving from one extreme to another. Today they eat too much, tomorrow they fast and diet, and the day after tomorrow they eat too much again. Choice always creates trouble.\nThere is a way to live life choicelessly – just watching, not choosing. And through watching, whatsoever is right starts happening. Not that you choose it: it starts happening on its own accord. Something is going to happen. If you don’t choose it is going to happen; if you don’t choose then God will choose for you, the whole will choose for you. And that is the right choice – when the whole chooses for you and you simply wait in a receptive mood, ready to go. But let the whole choose.\nAnd in being with a master it becomes easier: you can always leave it to me. That brings great freedom, because then there is no need to worry, to be tense, no need to toss and turn and to\ncontinuously remain in a kind of inner turmoil, chaos. Once you start dropping alternatives, life becomes very simple and very innocent, childlike. And out of that innocence, all that is needed arrives. That’s why Jesus repeats again and again ‘Unless you are like small children, you will not enter my Kingdom of God.’ A choiceless awareness is the phenomenon of innocence. One simply trusts life, trusts that whatsoever is coming will be good.\nSo from this moment live in a choiceless silence and you will be surprised how much freedom and how much joy is possible in ordinary, mundane things. Eating can be a celebration, sleeping can be a meditation, swimming can be ecstasy, because you start feeling one with the whole: you don’t have any choice, you don’t have any preferences, you don’t have any likes, dislikes.\n[An older sannyasin asks: Is it really possible for me to grow any more... because I sort of feel perhaps it isn’t. I’m too old!]\nMuch is still possible. And you are on the right track; things are getting ready for much more. So don’t close yourself, don’t think that now there is no more growth for you. One goes on growing. In fact growth continues even while you are dying. Growth is possible when a person is dying; it will depend what attitude he takes about death. If he is not afraid, if he is willing, relaxing, surrendering to death, he will be growing through it. If he is a watcher, cool and calm, if he allows death to happen, co-operates with it, he will be growing.\nAnd he may have the greatest experience of his life in it – that of death happening and not happening, because that which dies is not you. If you can be relaxed and calm and quiet, you will be able to see that. It is a very subtle experience. If you are disturbed, worried, clinging to life, fighting death, then you will miss it. That is the highest growth point.\nGrowth starts when a child is conceived in the mother’s womb and it continues all through life, but very few people grow that way. They only grow old, they don’t grow up; they stop growing. The average mental age of human beings is not more than twelve; that means people stop around twelve. The body goes on growing old but the mind is stuck; it goes on moving in the same groove, like a stuck gramophone record. Very few people go on growing. But you are fortunate: you are growing and the growth is still going to continue. You are going to make it even when death is happening.\nThat’s my whole purpose here: to help you to the very end. If you can be silent, loving, positive, affirmative, in death then you have really lived your life as it should have been lived. Then there is no grudge, no complaint. One is fulfilled, one is ripe, one is ready to fall and rest.…\n[A sannyasin, returning to the West to earn money to return to the commune forever, says: It’s very hard for me to leave you.\nOsho tells her: Yes, it is hard for me too! You don’t understand my trouble: every day so many sannyasins leave me; just think of me!\nAnd come back soon, you continue; the commune will need you. Try to come back as soon as possible. If you find it very difficult, write to me after six months. I will send the message: come without money!]\n[A sannyasin wants to do a masters degree in theatre at the university being set up in the ashram, but asks if she should do something more humble. Osho checks her energy.]\nGood. You do it, mm? It is nothing like an ego-trip. It is just very spontaneously coming into you. Go into it. It is the humblest thing to do. Whatsoever comes naturally is humble. Never impose anything; imposed things become egoistic.\nFor example, right now if you drop this idea which is very spontaneously coming into you and you try to do something humble, that will be real ego. You follow me? – because that will be effort, and behind that humble act will be really a great gratification of the ego: ‘I am doing something humble’ and the ‘I’ will be more strengthened through it. In fact the humble people have the biggest egos in the world. Egoists have nothing compared to humble people.\nSo always remain spontaneous and then you remain humble without any humbleness. With no self- consciousness of humbleness, one remains humble. One does not know that one is humble. If you know you are humble you are not; knowing it is not possible. How can you know your humbleness? – because all knowing is part of the ego: ‘I am this, I am that.’ What you claim is not the point. Any claim comes from the ego, all claims come from the ego.\nRemain spontaneous, natural. And this is something that is coming into your being, it is your natural flow. Go with it, do it. It will make you humble, mm? Good!\n[A sannyasin, who ran the healing group, said something deep from his belly is coming up which frightens him. He is picking up people’s symptoms and, when he is relating to people, everything that is going on. Osho checks his energy.]\nYou are becoming more and more available to people’s energy. It is a good indication that you are becoming open. In the beginning when one becomes open, first sympathy happens: one feels affected by others’ emotions, others’ energies.\nThen, when it goes really deep – which it wants to; that’s why you were feeling something deep in the stomach, something wants to happen – then sympathy turns into empathy. Then you don’t only feel what is happening to the other, you actually start feeling that it is happening to you. Sometimes illnesses can be transferred. Somebody has a headache and you become so empathic that you have the headache; you start having an inner experience of it. And it is possible too that the other’s headache may disappear, you can absorb it. We are connected with each other so this is possible.\nFirst there is sympathy – one feels for the other but one doesn’t feel what is actually happening, mm? One can feel sorry: somebody has some illness, suffering. One can feel sorry but one is not identified with it.\nYour energy wants to be identified and you are preventing it; hence you are afraid. You are afraid of it becoming too much. If you become loaded with everybody’s emotion and feeling and illness, then where will you be? So you are holding it down and it wants to assert itself.\nIt is a good phenomenon to allow. For a few days you will be in trouble but soon it will settle. Both sympathy and empathy will disappear; when you lose the idea that you are separate, then both\ndisappear. And that is a great experience. Allow it! This is how your satori is trying to happen, so don’t prevent it; be open. And take the risk. You will not be a loser, you will be gaining everything from it.\nAnd I am here to look after you. Just open up, go into the danger of it. It is risky, and I can understand the mind’s fear, but the mind has to be put aside; go in spite of the mind. Once you have gone into it you will be surprised that only in the beginning for a few days will it be troublesome. Once you have really accepted it all trouble disappears.\nAnd then for only a moment something may pass through you; that is the state of a healer. You can become a great healer if you allow it. Only for a moment: somebody has a headache, you put your hands on his head. . . only for a moment, for a split second, will you have the headache and then it will be gone. It will disappear from the other: it will pass through you and then go into the whole. Only for a split second, just like a wave, will it come to you, just pass through you and then be gone. So allow it. Good.\n[A sannyasin, who is leaving for the West, says he feels stuck in a pattern in his relationship, and should he work on it. Osho studies his energy and suggests he waits till his return to Poona for there is some emotional block. If it is worked on it will create much upheaval which will be difficult to handle in the West. They might even try to hospitalise you; you will have to pass through a kind of insanity. But once you have, you will bloom, fly. Then for the first time you will be capable of breathing, living and loving. That will be possible. You will need a very mothering atmosphere. That’s what I’m trying to create here – a womb where you can rest and can be reborn again.]\n[A sannyasin says he wants to go to the West to bring his children to Poona.]\nThey will come. Once we move, call them – just wait a little more. I am really in a hurry to move but the politicians and the priests and the whole vested interest don’t want me even to exist, mm? We are existing against great odds. They would like to destroy me and my work, so they create a thousand and one problems. They are unnecessary problems but they can create them. Each place that I find they create trouble about. So movement has become difficult but still, within six months, three months, we will move.\nThey have been doing that to me for my whole life. And it is natural – they have to do it. I am a danger to their whole pattern and to their whole tradition. They are becoming more and more frightened. As more people come to me, they have more fear. It is becoming a force now, so they don’t want me to have more land to move to because then it will become a world centre and that will be very difficult for them to cope with.\nBut it is going to happen; it is just a question of time so just wait three, four months more, and then all the children can come. If they want to stay here, they can stay here. No problem.

always in conflict with something or other; it needs conflict to exist.
It can exist only in conflict and through conflict. It is a constant
war, it is violence. It either fights with others or it starts fighting
with itself, but one thing is certain about it, that it cannot exist
without fight. It is its very breath.</p><p><br></p><p>The moment you stop fighting the mind starts disappearing on its own

worry, to be tense, no need to toss and turn and to</p><p><br></p><p>continuously remain in a kind of inner turmoil, chaos. Once you start
dropping alternatives, life becomes very simple and very innocent,
childlike. And out of that innocence, all that is needed arrives. That’s
why Jesus repeats again and again ‘Unless you are like small children,
you will not enter my Kingdom of God.’ A choiceless awareness is the
phenomenon of innocence. One simply trusts life, trusts that whatsoever
is coming will be good.</p><p><br></p><p>So from this moment live in a choiceless silence and you will be
surprised how much freedom and how much joy is possible in ordinary,
mundane things. Eating can be a celebration, sleeping can be a
meditation, swimming can be ecstasy, because you start feeling one with
the whole: you don’t have any choice, you don’t have any preferences,
you don’t have any likes, dislikes.</p><p><br></p><p>[An older sannyasin asks: Is it really possible for me to grow any
more... because I sort of feel perhaps it isn’t. I’m too old!]</p><p><br></p><p>Much is still possible. And you are on the right track; things are
getting ready for much more. So don’t close yourself, don’t think that
now there is no more growth for you. One goes on growing. In fact growth
continues even while you are dying. Growth is possible when a person is
dying; it will depend what attitude he takes about death. If he is not
afraid, if he is willing, relaxing, surrendering to death, he will be
growing through it. If he is a watcher, cool and calm, if he allows
death to happen, co-operates with it, he will be growing.</p><p><br></p><p>And he may have the greatest experience of his life in it – that of
death happening and not happening, because that which dies is not you.
If you can be relaxed and calm and quiet, you will be able to see that.
It is a very subtle experience. If you are disturbed, worried, clinging
to life, fighting death, then you will miss it. That is the highest
growth point.</p><p><br></p><p>Growth starts when a child is conceived in the mother’s womb and it
continues all through life, but very few people grow that way. They only
grow old, they don’t grow up; they stop growing. The average mental age
of human beings is not more than twelve; that means people stop around
twelve. The body goes on growing old but the mind is stuck; it goes on
moving in the same groove, like a stuck gramophone record. Very few
people go on growing. But you are fortunate: you are growing and the
growth is still going to continue. You are going to make it even when
death is happening.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s my whole purpose here: to help you to the very end. If you can
be silent, loving, positive, affirmative, in death then you have really
lived your life as it should have been lived. Then there is no grudge,
no complaint. One is fulfilled, one is ripe, one is ready to fall and
rest.…</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin, returning to the West to earn money to return to the
commune forever, says: It’s very hard for me to leave you.</p><p><br></p><p>Osho tells her: Yes, it is hard for me too! You don’t understand my
trouble: every day so many sannyasins leave me; just think of me!</p><p><br></p><p>And come back soon, you continue; the commune will need you. Try to
come back as soon as possible. If you find it very difficult, write to
me after six months. I will send the message: come without money!]</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin wants to do a masters degree in theatre at the
university being set up in the ashram, but asks if she should do
something more humble. Osho checks her energy.]</p><p><br></p><p>Good. You do it, mm? It is nothing like an ego-trip. It is just very
spontaneously coming into you. Go into it. It is the humblest thing to
do. Whatsoever comes naturally is humble. Never impose anything; imposed
things become egoistic.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, right now if you drop this idea which is very
spontaneously coming into you and you try to do something humble, that
will be real ego. You follow me? – because that will be effort, and
behind that humble act will be really a great gratification of the ego:
‘I am doing something humble’ and the ‘I’ will be more strengthened
through it. In fact the humble people have the biggest egos in the
world. Egoists have nothing compared to humble people.</p><p><br></p><p>So always remain spontaneous and then you remain humble without any
humbleness. With no self- consciousness of humbleness, one remains
humble. One does not know that one is humble. If you know you are humble
you are not; knowing it is not possible. How can you know your
humbleness? – because all knowing is part of the ego: ‘I am this, I am
that.’ What you claim is not the point. Any claim comes from the ego,
all claims come from the ego.</p><p><br></p><p>Remain spontaneous, natural. And this is something that is coming
into your being, it is your natural flow. Go with it, do it. It will
make you humble, mm? Good!</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin, who ran the healing group, said something deep from his
belly is coming up which frightens him. He is picking up people’s
symptoms and, when he is relating to people, everything that is going
on. Osho checks his energy.]</p><p><br></p><p>You are becoming more and more available to people’s energy. It is a
good indication that you are becoming open. In the beginning when one
becomes open, first sympathy happens: one feels affected by others’
emotions, others’ energies.</p><p><br></p><p>Then, when it goes really deep – which it wants to; that’s why you
were feeling something deep in the stomach, something wants to happen –
then sympathy turns into empathy. Then you don’t only feel what is
happening to the other, you actually start feeling that it is happening
to you. Sometimes illnesses can be transferred. Somebody has a headache
and you become so empathic that you have the headache; you start having
an inner experience of it. And it is possible too that the other’s
headache may disappear, you can absorb it. We are connected with each
other so this is possible.</p><p><br></p><p>First there is sympathy – one feels for the other but one doesn’t
feel what is actually happening, mm? One can feel sorry: somebody has
some illness, suffering. One can feel sorry but one is not identified
with it.</p><p><br></p><p>Your energy wants to be identified and you are preventing it; hence
you are afraid. You are afraid of it becoming too much. If you become
loaded with everybody’s emotion and feeling and illness, then where will
you be? So you are holding it down and it wants to assert itself.</p><p><br></p><p>It is a good phenomenon to allow. For a few days you will be in
trouble but soon it will settle. Both sympathy and empathy will
disappear; when you lose the idea that you are separate, then both</p><p><br></p><p>disappear. And that is a great experience. Allow it! This is how your
satori is trying to happen, so don’t prevent it; be open. And take the
risk. You will not be a loser, you will be gaining everything from
it.</p><p><br></p><p>And I am here to look after you. Just open up, go into the danger of
it. It is risky, and I can understand the mind’s fear, but the mind has
to be put aside; go in spite of the mind. Once you have gone into it you
will be surprised that only in the beginning for a few days will it be
troublesome. Once you have really accepted it all trouble
disappears.</p><p><br></p><p>And then for only a moment something may pass through you; that is
the state of a healer. You can become a great healer if you allow it.
Only for a moment: somebody has a headache, you put your hands on his
head. . . only for a moment, for a split second, will you have the
headache and then it will be gone. It will disappear from the other: it
will pass through you and then go into the whole. Only for a split
second, just like a wave, will it come to you, just pass through you and
then be gone. So allow it. Good.</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin, who is leaving for the West, says he feels stuck in a
pattern in his relationship, and should he work on it. Osho studies his
energy and suggests he waits till his return to Poona for there is some
emotional block. If it is worked on it will create much upheaval which
will be difficult to handle in the West. They might even try to
hospitalise you; you will have to pass through a kind of insanity. But
once you have, you will bloom, fly. Then for the first time you will be
capable of breathing, living and loving. That will be possible. You will
need a very mothering atmosphere. That’s what I’m trying to create here
– a womb where you can rest and can be reborn again.]</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin says he wants to go to the West to bring his children to
Poona.]</p><p><br></p><p>They will come. Once we move, call them – just wait a little more. I
am really in a hurry to move but the politicians and the priests and the
whole vested interest don’t want me even to exist, mm? We are existing
against great odds. They would like to destroy me and my work, so they
create a thousand and one problems. They are unnecessary problems but
they can create them. Each place that I find they create trouble about.
So movement has become difficult but still, within six months, three
months, we will move.</p><p><br></p><p>They have been doing that to me for my whole life. And it is natural
– they have to do it. I am a danger to their whole pattern and to their
whole tradition. They are becoming more and more frightened. As more
people come to me, they have more fear. It is becoming a force now, so
they don’t want me to have more land to move to because then it will
become a world centre and that will be very difficult for them to cope
with.</p><p><br></p><p>But it is going to happen; it is just a question of time so just wait
three, four months more, and then all the children can come. If they
want to stay here, they can stay here. No problem. Good!</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part1>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

Truth is beyond argument. It cannot be proved, it cannot be disproved either. All argumentation about truth is utterly futile. Hence philosophy goes on missing the point. That’s the difference between philosophy and religion: philosophy argues, religion experiences. Through argument you go about and about, round and round in circles, but you never penetrate the core of the problem. You do much speculation but it is all verbal, chattering of the mind. You can be very convinced by your own chattering but it doesn’t transform you.\nTruth liberates but truth enters into one’s being only when argumentation ceases, when there is no argument inside. One is utterly silent, one has no prejudice this way or that, for or against. One has no knowledge, because all knowledge is based on argumentation. One does not know whether God is or is not. One simply knows not. In that pure state of not-knowing, truth happens. To function from that state of not-knowing is to be in meditation.\nSarvo means the whole, the total, the all, and geet means a song – the song of the whole. One wants to sing one’s own song. That creates the ego, that is the ego. And if one goes on persisting in singing one’s own song, one remains in misery. That song cannot be sung because one does not really exist apart from the whole, one is part of the whole. Only the whole can sing it. We can become hollow bamboos to allow the song to flow through us but we cannot sing it.\nThere are only two types of people: one, who wants to sing his own song. Him I call the worldly, the egoist. And the other, who wants God to sing the song through him, one who wants to surrender, one who wants just to become a vehicle, a door, a passage – that is the spiritual person.\nJesus says ‘Thy kingdom come, thy will be done’. That’s what I mean when I say become a hollow bamboo. The song is continuously being sung by the whole. It never stops for a single moment. It is always going on and on, it is eternal. It is just that we are clogged up, closed, blocked. All that is\nneeded is not how to learn to sing – all that is needed is how not to keep those blocks, how not to go on holding those blocks. Let them melt, let them disappear. Become empty so that the song can fill you and can overflow through you.\nPrem means love, and Mali means gardener. Create in your heart a garden of love. Outer gardens won’t do, only the inner can be of any help. The outer is simply a shadow of the inner. The outer beauty is nothing compared to the inner beauty and the outer flowers are nothing compared to the inner flowers, but they remind us of the inner. So it is good to be in love with a garden, with trees, with mountains, with rivers, with the sky and the stars, because they remind you of the inner, of something of the inner. But they are nothing compared to the inner, because in the inner garden of life roses bloom and they are roses of eternity, not of time, roses that never fade, lotuses which are not of this world.\nSo move inwards. The work here is basically to plant seeds in the heart. Whenever the right time comes, they sprout. All that is needed on the part of man is to plant those seeds, then everything starts happening. The soil is ready, just the seeds are missing.\n[A sannyasin asks how to get rid of her garbage.\nThe garbage can be very easily dropped – you just have to see that it is garbage. We go on saying it is garbage but we don’t see it as garbage. Deep down we believe in it, deep down we think it is something valuable; if it is lost then a treasure will be lost. So on the surface we go on calling it garbage and deep down we go on clinging to it, protecting it. A contradiction arises. And whatsoever you are holding deep down and denying just on the surface, you cannot get free of, because the surface mind is a very small part, one-tenth. Nine-tenths is the deeper mind, so nine-tenths of your being is holding on to it as valuable and one-tenth is denying it as garbage. The whole effort is bound to fail, doomed to fail. That’s why people try to get rid of it for their whole life and they never succeed. On the contrary, in trying to get rid of it they start collecting even more garbage. Trying to get rid of the ordinary garbage they start collecting extraordinary garbage – occult, esoteric, astrological, because they think these things are going to help.\nIt is not a question of finding a way to get rid of it. The only question is to see it as garbage. That needs courage because this is all that you have. A man does not like to be empty. Even if he has to cling to garbage, he will choose garbage rather than being empty because emptiness frightens!\nSo that is the basic point. Because of that we go on clinging; anything is good. We don’t look deep into it because we are afraid we may see that it is garbage and then there will be nothing to cling to. So people go on clinging to relationships which are dead and they don’t look into them. They know that if they look they will see that there is nothing any more. No flow is there, no life is there, no love is there. But they avoid seeing the fact. They go on pretending that everything is okay or if it is not okay, it will be okay tomorrow. We will do something and everything will settle. And they go on clinging, they go on clinging.\nIf you go on clinging and then you go on asking how to get rid of it, that too is a part of the game. So we can tell ourselves ‘What can I do? I am trying to get rid of it, I am trying to find ways and means to get rid of it. What can I do? What else can I do? If I cannot get rid of it I am not responsible. I have not yet found the right means, the right method, the right person to help me!’ So we can throw the responsibility and we can postpone.\nMy suggestion is that you be here for these four or five weeks. Just see it, that it is garbage. It will be hard, it will be a rough journey, but once you have gone through it, the very seeing becomes the dropping of it. There is no other method. To see the false as false is to get rid of it. If you see the wall as the wall then there is no point in asking how to get through it – it is a wall! To see the wall as the wall is the beginning of seeing the door as the door.\nNiranjano means purity, innocence, unattachment. The moment you become attached to anything you become impure, you become overwhelmed by the other. The foreign element enters into your being through attachment. When you are not attached to anything you remain simply yourself. No shadow falls on you from the other. Your mirror remains pure, uncontaminated. That state is called ‘niranjano’... and that is the state to be attained because only then do you come to see the beauty and the grandeur and the splendour of existence.\nWe have become too tiny because of our attachments. Somebody is attached to his money and he has become his money. You can see the dirtiness of currency notes on the miser’s face. Somebody is attached to something else and he has become that. One becomes that, whatsoever it is to which one gets attached, identified. In being unattached, unidentified, one becomes pure sky. In that purity all is known, God is known. That purity is God.\nPrem means love, Aloka means light. Love is light. Without love all is dark. Love becomes the sunrise. And just as with the sunrise millions of things start happening on the earth, so it happens with love. Sleep disappears – it is only through love that one becomes aware. Birds start singing – it is only through love that one’s unsung song starts taking form. Without love, life is latent. With love, it explodes.\n[A visitor says: I feel like a mirror. If people are happy, I am happyespecially since she started\nsufi dancing. Osho checks her energy.]\nYes, I can see it is happening there, but it is not something bad, not at all. You need not be frightened about it. No harm will happen to you. You have started opening towards people, and it is good.\nYou have remained a very very closed person for your whole life. And that’s why something new is happening and you are afraid. Your childhood is coming back. If you can allow it there will be great blessing. But there will be fear, naturally because you have lived a certain kind of closed life, controlled, disciplined, always holding yourself uptight. This seems to be bizarre, that you become affected with people’s energy, but this is good. That’s how everybody should be.\nBecome a sannyasin!\nNow become full of meand don t be afraid!\nDeepma means a light, a lamp. And the light is there, it just has to be allowed. It is ready to burst forth. It needs your co-operation. For your whole life you have lived in a very hard way, in a German way! Now relax, be more in a kind of let-go and the light will arise. For the first time you will have the taste of what life means. The taste of life is love. And that’s what is happening to you: you are falling deeply in love with people, with strangers. You are becoming engulfed with their energy. It is a beautiful phenomenon – sway with it, move with it, dance with it.\n[A sannyasin says she is very insecure in her relationship with Osho because she doesn’t know him.]\nThere is no need to know. Just go on loving and knowing will happen. Love is the real way to know. There is no other way to know. If you try to know before, before entering a relationship of love, you will never enter any relationship. Because knowledge is not possible, only love knows. But then there is a problem: before knowing you have to take the jump. But now you need not be afraid. You have already taken the jump. Now there is no going back!...\nThings are going great. You need not figure it out – I have figured it out!\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"1867","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/let_go/part20/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/let_go/>Let Go!</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">20</h1><div class=post-meta>9 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1867 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Let_Go/part20.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part19>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

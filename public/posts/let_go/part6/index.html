It is a metaphor for purity, freshness, aliveness. And a man has to be that purity, that aliveness, that early morning freshness. Only through that freshness can God be contacted. People are very very dusty: they go on gathering dust, they are dust collectors. Their very being is polluted. The pollution in the atmosphere is not the source – the source is somewhere in the being of man. When our being is polluted, then only do we start polluting nature, not vice versa. When a man feels utterly hellish inside he starts creating and projecting hell outside.\nMillions ask ‘Where is God?’ They should ask where their freshness is, where their mirrorlike quality to reflect is. If that mirror-like quality is there, God is; if that quality is missing, God cannot be contacted. So become ‘nasim’.\nAll meditations are nothing but devices to purify the inner being... so is prayer. The whole science of religion tends towards one goal: how to purify the inner being of man, how to drop the past, the burden, the dead, the dull, how to make man more sensitive. The deeper the sensitivity, the deeper we penetrate existence. And God is the very core of existence. Unless we penetrate our own core there is no possibility of contacting the source of all life.\nIt is not an accident that all the religions have chosen morning as prayer time. The morning has the quality of prayer; it has to be imbibed. And once you know the knack of it you can remain in that state for twenty-four hours. The morning can continue inside, there is no need to lose it; even in the afternoon, in the night, one can remain fresh, young, alive, spontaneous, sensitive, aware.…\n[Osho tells an initiate to close his eyes and just listen to the sounds, adding... ]\nThe purpose of listening to all the sounds is just to give you a device so that you can open up to me. It is not concentration. Nothing has to be excluded; this chanting, the insects, all the sounds have to be absorbed.\nPrem means love, Anada means silence, utter silence, absolute silence. Love is silence because no word is adequate to express it, no gesture is spacious enough to contain it. No limitation can go with love; it is something undefined. It is wordless. It is beyond and below language.\nSo whenever somebody is in love, language immediately fails – it is no more expressive. When lovers talk that simply means that love has disappeared; now they are filling the gap by words. When they are immensely in love they simply sit silently together... in that togetherness when energies meet and merge. And those energies are not of the mind, those energies are of the being. They are not of thinking, they are of feeling. Exactly the same happens when you are in love with existence. Of course it happens in a million-fold wayTo be in love with existence is to be religious.\nTo be with existence in silence is to be in prayer or meditation. And we have lost that capacity.\nMan has become too wordy. The word has become his world. He lives in words and he has forgotten that he has depths beyond depths which no word can ever penetrate. That’s why the modern man seems so shallow. And when the inner silence has been felt, even your words carry it. The fragrance of it even lingers around the words, even small gestures become great poetry. The way one looks, the very eyes, the way one walks the very grace, expresses something which cannot be expressed. And not to know that which cannot be expressed is to remain poor. To know that which cannot be expressed is to become really rich because that is what God is all about.\nWill it be easy to pronounce? – ‘Prem Anada’. This is going to be your work on yourself: be loving and be silent and let your love and silence become one, slowly, slowly one. Let your silence be loving and your loving be silent. And great experiences will happen through it, the door will open through it.…\n[A sannyasin is leaving for the West.]\nWherever you are, start working for me – you are ready for it now. And remember one thing: there are many things that you will learn only by teaching people, many things that you will get only by sharing with people. Unless you share your joys they tend to die. A constant sharing is needed to keep them alive and flowing.\nSo whenever you experience something of the extraordinary share it immediately. Share with your friends, acquaintances, family, share with all those you love and you care for. And you will be surprised: if you share, it grows. Sharing is feeding it, nursing it. The more fragrance is released, the more capable you become of releasing. So never hoard any experience inside, otherwise it goes stale. It not only dies, it becomes poisonous to the system. When a song has arisen in the heart it has to be sung and when the energy is ready to dance you have to dance.\nAnd never feel shy. In the beginning it looks a little awkward, it looks a little pretentious to say something out of the ordinary. They will think you are crazy. Take that risk: let them think you are crazy! If you talk to ten people one is bound to respond. And that is more than enough. Nine won’t listen to you; that is their business, don’t feel offended. But even if they don’t listen\nto you, you will be benefited because you shared, because you showed your compassion. The word compassion means exactly that: sharing – sharing your passion. That is the meaning of compassion: communicating your passion, communing your passion.\nYour compassion grows – whether they listen or not, whether they take any note of it or not. And who knows? – today they may not take, tomorrow they may. Your words will remain there like seeds. Whenever the time comes and the season is ready, those seeds will sprout. These are eternal seeds, they never die. Sometimes it takes centuries and many lives for the right time to come, but it does come: suddenly one day the seed has sprouted and leaves have come out of the earth. You may not be there, the person may have forgotten about you but your work is fulfilled, sooner or later it is fulfilled. But that is not the point.\nOut of ten, one is bound to respond immediately and that response helps you tremendously. It gives you more confidence, it gives you a deep certainty that you are on the right track and a sense of great fulfilment that you have been of some help to somebody.\nSo just go. Wherever you are, help people towards me.\n[Osho explains that Vedant means ‘that which transcends the scriptures’ adding that the scriptures have to be transcended for God is beyond them – beyond all concepts of God, beyond all their compensations. What is needed is: seeing that which is, not inferring about it, not guessing about it but a direct seeing of truth.]\nThat is my whole work here: to help people to go beyond all words. It is possible, and because it is possible, that is the only hope. Man can have a taste of God – there is no need to think about Him. One can eat Him and one can drink Him.\n[A sannyasin, newly arrived, asks advice on her relationship with a married man who is also attached to his wife and children. She goes very deep with him and wants more time with him. Osho says that this attitude is suicidal because one must choose between depth or length, the two cannot co-exist.]\nAlways in every civilization and culture, wherever culture has reached to a peak, this has happened again and again, that people have settled with two women or with two men; that has been the best arrangement. With one woman the best relationship is of a husband, father, householder; with another woman the relationship is of romance, poetry, love. It is the easiest way. To have both relationships with one woman is very dangerous. It rarely happens, in fact it never happens.\nThis is the perfect way. And feel grateful to his wife because she is helping your relationship to go deep, in fact she is the cause. If you take him away from his wife, then he will have to find another woman just as he has found you. Then he will have one kind of relationship with you – husband-wife – and he will be a lover to somebody else. Feel grateful to that woman and whatsoever you can do for that woman, do. Because she is the cause of the whole love affair.…\nSo never feel angry and never feel bad about that. It is perfectly good, leave it as it is. Go deep with appetite, with longing, with passion. Don’t ask for length, ask always for depth. It is only out of depth that this contentment arises, not out of length. And one cannot have both, remember. The mind would like to have both – why not both? But one cannot have both because it is one energy: either\nit spreads this way or it spreads that way. Or if you spread it both ways, then both will be half-half; the length will not be enough and the depth will be not be enough.\nJust enjoy as it is: enjoy this hankering, this constant desire to have more. That too is good, enjoy that too. And you can reap a great harvest out of this relationship. Don’t force in any way – knowingly, unknowingly – the man to be with you more. Otherwise sooner or later he will be finished with you, you will be finished with him and then again one starts looking somewhere else.\nNever finish a relationship. That’s what the mind is asking: have it totally so it is finished. Squeeze all the juice out of it; but then it is gone! In this way it will remain alive, it will never be killed. For one week you cannot see him and then for one weekend you can. For seven days you are longing for him and the heart is thirsty. And then you jump upon each other! This is good. This is my idea of how things should be.\nIt is always good to never live together with the person you love. It will be hard but life only comes to people who are ready to go the hard way. There are no short-cuts in life. Just enjoy it. And bring the man sometime here, mm?\n[A sannyasin, newly returned, says he and his girlfriend are going through many changes. He realises he uses her, and also Osho, to fill his needs.]\nA few things.… One: ordinarily ninety-nine percent of what people call love is nothing but need. So don’t be too much disturbed by it, it is natural. The state of the mind of humanity is such that that is the natural state. And because you need, you naturally become dependent. Hence all love creates bondage and the vicious circle: one does not want to be in a bondage, one does not want to be a dependent – it hurts the ego – so one pulls oneself away. But when one pulls oneself away, one’s needs are not fulfilled, so one feels hungry, then one goes into it again. This becomes a constant movement: coming closer, going away. That’s how the pendulum of the mind goes on moving. And there is no way to decide because when you are away you start feeling the need. Love is food!\nYour body needs it, your mind needs it, your being needs it. Without love you will feel left out in a cold world. Nobody to hug, nobody to give you warmth. You will feel like a lost child. So you become frightened when you are alone. Then you start moving towards the person you love. You forget all about dependence and all about bondage. Keep the lovers separate and they start feeling very very great love for each other; bring them together and within days they hate each other. And this hate-love relationship continues, this is a vicious circle: the hate takes you away; when you go away love arises. Love brings you close; when you come close, you feel dependent, bondage arises, you are feeling caged, imprisoned. The movement away from the person starts again.\nBut this is the natural state of an unconscious mind so don’t hanker for something better than this. At this point nothing better is possible. If you want something better you will have to change your state of mind, not your relationship. You understand...? You are trying to change your relationship – that is not possible. With this mind only this which is happening is possible. You have to accept it and enjoy it. Enjoy it as much, as best you can, but you cannot change it. If you want to change it you are not to go directly into changing it; you have to change your mind, you have to change your consciousness. You have to become more meditative, you have to become more aware; only that can bring any change in your love. Only when the mind goes higher, to higher levels of consciousness, does love\ngo higher. With a certain kind of mind a certain kind of love exists; you cannot change love. Love is dependent on the state of the mind.\nSo with this state of mind don’t create unnecessary misery for yourself. Accept it, it is a need. [Your girlfriend] is a need for you, you are a need for her; it is a mutual exploitation. Just be just, that’s all; be fair, that’s all. Exploit her as much as you can but let her also exploit you as much as she can, that’s all. At this point nothing more is possible. Don’t cheat her, that’s all. Be honest in your exploitation and allow her also to exploit you, because she also needs you. Don’t think that it is only you who are using her; she is also using you, don’t befool yourself. Both of you are using each other but that is how it is and how it should be at this stage. Accept it and start working more on awareness. Only with that change, slowly slowly, the quality of love will change. Nobody can change love directly.\nAnd the second thing: if your love is of that kind, your relationship with me will also be of that kind because that too is a love relationship so it can’t be more than that. But one thing is different about our relationship: I have nothing to take from you – it is not mutual; you can take as much as you are able. In fact, I am very grateful to those people who go on taking from me. They unburden me; I am thankful, they need not be thankful towards me.\nSo about that you need not worry – you can exploit me as much as you can, with no guilt. That will also change only when your mind changes. Once this is understood things will be very simple.\nMeditate more or try awareness methods. Have you done Vipassana? (he nods that he has) Then use Vipassana as a method. Walk, move, more and more with the Vipassana attitude. Sit silently for at least two hours – one in the morning, one in the evening. Rather than tackling the problem of love directly, move indirectly. And you will be surprised – just an inch more of awareness and you will see that the quality of love is automatically changing.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2694","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/let_go/part6/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/let_go/>Let Go!</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">6</h1><div class=post-meta>13 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2694 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Let_Go/part6.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part5>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

particular breeze. It is a metaphor for purity, freshness, aliveness.
And a man has to be that purity, that aliveness, that early morning
freshness. Only through that freshness can God be contacted. People are
very very dusty: they go on gathering dust, they are dust collectors.
Their very being is polluted. The pollution in the atmosphere is not the

fulfilment that you have been of some help to somebody.</p><p><br></p><p>So just go. Wherever you are, help people towards me.</p><p><br></p><p>[Osho explains that Vedant means ‘that which transcends the
scriptures’ adding that the scriptures have to be transcended for God is
beyond them – beyond all concepts of God, beyond all their
compensations. What is needed is: seeing that which is, not inferring
about it, not guessing about it but a direct seeing of truth.]</p><p><br></p><p>That is my whole work here: to help people to go beyond all words. It
is possible, and because it is possible, that is the only hope. Man can
have a taste of God – there is no need to think about Him. One can eat
Him and one can drink Him.</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin, newly arrived, asks advice on her relationship with a
married man who is also attached to his wife and children. She goes very
deep with him and wants more time with him. Osho says that this attitude
is suicidal because one must choose between depth or length, the two
cannot co-exist.]</p><p><br></p><p>Always in every civilization and culture, wherever culture has
reached to a peak, this has happened again and again, that people have
settled with two women or with two men; that has been the best
arrangement. With one woman the best relationship is of a husband,
father, householder; with another woman the relationship is of romance,
poetry, love. It is the easiest way. To have both relationships with one
woman is very dangerous. It rarely happens, in fact it never
happens.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the perfect way. And feel grateful to his wife because she is
helping your relationship to go deep, in fact she is the cause. If you
take him away from his wife, then he will have to find another woman
just as he has found you. Then he will have one kind of relationship
with you – husband-wife – and he will be a lover to somebody else. Feel
grateful to that woman and whatsoever you can do for that woman, do.
Because she is the cause of the whole love affair.…</p><p><br></p><p>So never feel angry and never feel bad about that. It is perfectly
good, leave it as it is. Go deep with appetite, with longing, with
passion. Don’t ask for length, ask always for depth. It is only out of
depth that this contentment arises, not out of length. And one cannot
have both, remember. The mind would like to have both – why not both?
But one cannot have both because it is one energy: either</p><p><br></p><p>it spreads this way or it spreads that way. Or if you spread it both
ways, then both will be half-half; the length will not be enough and the
depth will be not be enough.</p><p><br></p><p>Just enjoy as it is: enjoy this hankering, this constant desire to
have more. That too is good, enjoy that too. And you can reap a great
harvest out of this relationship. Don’t force in any way – knowingly,
unknowingly – the man to be with you more. Otherwise sooner or later he
will be finished with you, you will be finished with him and then again
one starts looking somewhere else.</p><p><br></p><p>Never finish a relationship. That’s what the mind is asking: have it
totally so it is finished. Squeeze all the juice out of it; but then it
is gone! In this way it will remain alive, it will never be killed. For
one week you cannot see him and then for one weekend you can. For seven
days you are longing for him and the heart is thirsty. And then you jump
upon each other! This is good. This is my idea of how things should
be.</p><p><br></p><p>It is always good to never live together with the person you love. It
will be hard but life only comes to people who are ready to go the hard
way. There are no short-cuts in life. Just enjoy it. And bring the man
sometime here, mm?</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin, newly returned, says he and his girlfriend are going
through many changes. He realises he uses her, and also Osho, to fill
his needs.]</p><p><br></p><p>A few things.… One: ordinarily ninety-nine percent of what people
call love is nothing but need. So don’t be too much disturbed by it, it
is natural. The state of the mind of humanity is such that that is the
natural state. And because you need, you naturally become dependent.
Hence all love creates bondage and the vicious circle: one does not want
to be in a bondage, one does not want to be a dependent – it hurts the
ego – so one pulls oneself away. But when one pulls oneself away, one’s
needs are not fulfilled, so one feels hungry, then one goes into it
again. This becomes a constant movement: coming closer, going away.
That’s how the pendulum of the mind goes on moving. And there is no way
to decide because when you are away you start feeling the need. Love is
food!</p><p><br></p><p>Your body needs it, your mind needs it, your being needs it. Without
love you will feel left out in a cold world. Nobody to hug, nobody to
give you warmth. You will feel like a lost child. So you become
frightened when you are alone. Then you start moving towards the person
you love. You forget all about dependence and all about bondage. Keep
the lovers separate and they start feeling very very great love for each
other; bring them together and within days they hate each other. And
this hate-love relationship continues, this is a vicious circle: the
hate takes you away; when you go away love arises. Love brings you
close; when you come close, you feel dependent, bondage arises, you are
feeling caged, imprisoned. The movement away from the person starts
again.</p><p><br></p><p>But this is the natural state of an unconscious mind so don’t hanker
for something better than this. At this point nothing better is
possible. If you want something better you will have to change your
state of mind, not your relationship. You understand...? You are trying
to change your relationship – that is not possible. With this mind only
this which is happening is possible. You have to accept it and enjoy it.
Enjoy it as much, as best you can, but you cannot change it. If you want
to change it you are not to go directly into changing it; you have to
change your mind, you have to change your consciousness. You have to
become more meditative, you have to become more aware; only that can
bring any change in your love. Only when the mind goes higher, to higher
levels of consciousness, does love</p><p><br></p><p>go higher. With a certain kind of mind a certain kind of love exists;
you cannot change love. Love is dependent on the state of the mind.</p><p><br></p><p>So with this state of mind don’t create unnecessary misery for
yourself. Accept it, it is a need. [Your girlfriend] is a need for you,
you are a need for her; it is a mutual exploitation. Just be just,
that’s all; be fair, that’s all. Exploit her as much as you can but let
her also exploit you as much as she can, that’s all. At this point
nothing more is possible. Don’t cheat her, that’s all. Be honest in your
exploitation and allow her also to exploit you, because she also needs
you. Don’t think that it is only you who are using her; she is also
using you, don’t befool yourself. Both of you are using each other but
that is how it is and how it should be at this stage. Accept it and
start working more on awareness. Only with that change, slowly slowly,
the quality of love will change. Nobody can change love directly.</p><p><br></p><p>And the second thing: if your love is of that kind, your relationship
with me will also be of that kind because that too is a love
relationship so it can’t be more than that. But one thing is different
about our relationship: I have nothing to take from you – it is not
mutual; you can take as much as you are able. In fact, I am very
grateful to those people who go on taking from me. They unburden me; I
am thankful, they need not be thankful towards me.</p><p><br></p><p>So about that you need not worry – you can exploit me as much as you
can, with no guilt. That will also change only when your mind changes.
Once this is understood things will be very simple.</p><p><br></p><p>Meditate more or try awareness methods. Have you done Vipassana? (he
nods that he has) Then use Vipassana as a method. Walk, move, more and
more with the Vipassana attitude. Sit silently for at least two hours –
one in the morning, one in the evening. Rather than tackling the problem
of love directly, move indirectly. And you will be surprised – just an
inch more of awareness and you will see that the quality of love is
automatically changing.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part5>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

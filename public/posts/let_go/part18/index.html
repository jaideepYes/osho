And it is not the victory that comes from the outside, because that victory brings only darkness and nothing else. The victory that brings light comes from within. It is not conquering the other, it is conquering oneself. And I use the expression ‘conquering oneself’ very hesitatingly because in fact it is not a conquering at all: there is nobody to be conquered, there are not two persons inside. So it is more of an understanding, more of a knowing, more of a perception. Once you have seen the inner core of your being a light arises in you and then you start living in that radiancy, in that joy. Nobody can take it away from you and it is not something that can be destroyed either, even death cannot destroy it. It is not something that is caused by something, it is acausal. You need not put any fuel on it; the light continues. It is perpetual, it is eternal. In fact that light is what we are – fragments of that light – but looking outward that light remains at the back, and because of that light at the back, a great shadow falls on our path, our own shadow. That creates darkness.\nSo those who move outward remain in darkness. Those who start moving inward become enlightened. Because the source of light is within, once you turn about and start looking into the source of light there can never be any darkness. And slowly, slowly, as you come to the light, you become the light. Then the understanding arises. That explosion Zen people call ‘satori’ and in India we call it ‘samadhi’. That explosion happens one day when you suddenly realise that you are not separate from the light, that you are the light. That’s what Jesus means when he says ‘I am the light.’\nPrem means love, Madhu means wine – love wine. Get intoxicated with love and then nothing else is needed. Not even God is needed. In fact, people have created God as a substitute because they cannot love. If man starts loving then love will be the only god. There will be no need to create churches and temples and images and worship. Love will be worship and it will be enough unto itself. It will reveal all the mysteries of life.\nThat’s what Jesus means when he says ‘Love is God.’ It is a great statement, one of the most potential statements. It is simply saying that if you love, God becomes irrelevant. God is created by the unloving people. To the loving, the word ‘God’ is just meaningless. Love has all meaning, all significance, all poetry. Love can be tasted and love can be lived. Through living love, slowly, slowly you become aware that the whole existence is full of love. That is the first encounter with God.\nOnce you become intoxicated with love, no other intoxicant is needed. All other intoxicants have been invented because man is missing something very deeply in his being; he has become incapable of love. And it is only in love that the self disappears. Because the self cannot disappear, it becomes too heavy, a burden; it has to be forgotten in some way or other. Alcohol helps, drugs help to forget about it. They don’t dissolve it, it comes back. They can’t dissolve it – only love can dissolve it forever – but they can at least for the moment create the illusion that you are not there at all. You can relax for the moment, can forget all the miseries that the ego creates and the responsibilities and the anxieties that are bound to follow the ego. Intoxicants have been invented to forget the ego. God has been invented to create something which can become a substitute for love.\nMy whole approach is basically that of love. Love and all else will be right. You will not need to put it right – it will be right of its own accord. Love brings you in harmony and when you are in harmony immediately the whole existence is in harmony for you. Love creates an order – it is not a discipline imposed from the outside. Then there is no need of the pub or the priest, no need to forget the self, because it is no more there. And there is no need to search for God because He has been found in love.\n[A sannyasin says that his name means ‘saint of love’ and he feels confused because Osho has criticised saints in his discourses.]\nThe saints that I criticise are not saints of love. They are all anti-love, anti-life, they are not life- affirmative. I don’t condemn them because they are saints, I condemn them because they are anti-life. If somebody is full of life’s joy and love for life then there is real saintliness.\nReal saintliness cannot be against love and against life. It can’t be against this celebration that goes on and on. Real saintliness will be a participation in existence as it is. The real sage or saint will not choose, he will accept whatsoever is given. The body is given, he will accept it. The world is given, he will accept it, and he will accept it in immense gratitude because it is God’s gift.\nSo I am against the so-called saints – I am trying to create real saints. And unless we can create real people the world is doomed. Religion has been condemnatory too long. It has crippled, paralysed people’s lives. I want religion to give you freedom, not paralysis... a capacity to dance, to be fluid, to be liquid, a capacity to love, to relate, to communicate, not just to become a monk and close into yourself.\nThere are two things which are of the highest importance in life. One is meditation, another is love. Up to now the worldly person has chosen love and the other-worldly has chosen meditation and both have become lopsided. An inch’s distinction and heaven and earth are set apart. It creates dichotomy and your being also becomes divided.\nMy effort here is to create individuals, not schizophrenic people – unities, integrated persons, and the highest kind of synthesis happens only through love and meditation together. So when you are\nfeeling like being alone, meditate; then forget everything else. Soon the desire will arise to relate, to be loved, to love. Then forget all about the inner. Move totally into the other and let that moment be as deep as possible. Go into the other deeply and y\nyou will be surprised that going deeply into the other helps you to go deeply into yourself. Then go deeply into yourself and you will be amazed that the deeper :you go into yourself, the more capable you become of loving.\nThat is my definition of a saint, so you need not be worried what I say about saints. I am creating a new kind of saint!\n[The sannyasin says he will be back when the new commune starts in Gujarat.]\nGujarat seems to be difficult – the government has created too much difficulty. It may not happen.…\nThe commune is going to happen, but somewhere else. It may not be near the sea. They are afraid to give me a place near the sea. They think that will create trouble for them. I can relate with people directly or with some other countries; that is their fear. People can come directly to me by the sea route, that is... So they will not allow me to go to the sea coast.\nYou have to drop that idea. You can come any time, when you want.\n[A sannyasin says he’s returning to his small holding. He loves the way of life there – tending animals, growing things – but he doesn’t earn any money so doesn’t know when he’ll be able to come back to see you. So no need, you tell him. I will come and visit you!]\n[A sannyasin, who is leaving, says: I cannot comprehend your words because of my mind. You say something, my mind says something else. Something in me tries to debate every time.]\nMm mm, so you continue! This is your life and whatsoever you want to do with it, do. You have wasted the whole time you have been here, utterly wasted it. But this is your life and if you want to waste it, waste it.\nYou have not listened to me, you have not done anything according to me – from the very beginning you came, you started. I gave you some name then immediately you said ‘I don’t want this name.’ You have the name that you wanted, not my name. That day I knew that you would waste time. These are small gestures that show what kind of person one is. Then you have been constantly in conflict with the ashram, with people, with everything. But this is your life – nothing can be forced on you. You have to see the point: that you have been here for all these months and you have missed. You have not gained anything. If you think you have gained something out of your doubts, negativity, then it is perfectly good: continue the doubts and continue the negativity. I am not against it. But if you feel that you have not gained anything out of it, then next time you come don’t listen to it.\nOne has to be very clear, because life can be wasted. If you already think that you know what is true and what is right, then there is no need to bother to listen to me at all. Why bother ? If you know what is truth and if you know how One should live and what one should do, there is no need to bother about me. Why waste time? Live your truth!\nIf you don’t know, then listen to me and do the things that I’m telling you to do; don’t bring your mind in. Either this way or that – one has to be very decisive. Otherwise you are neither following your mind nor me. So you will be just in the middle and unnecessarily puzzled, confused, dragged from this polarity to that. One moment you will think this is right, another moment you will think that is right.\nYou have to give it a try. If you think your mind is on the right lines, then for one year don’t listen to anybody, don’t read anything. Just listen to your mind and follow it. And one year’s experiment will be decisive; it will show you whether your mind can lead you somewhere. If it docs, so far so good! With all my blessings go with it. If you think that the time is wasted and your mind leads nowhere – you simply go round and round in circles and you remain where you were – then jump out of it! Have the courage to jump out of it. What you are doing is trying to do both. And that will not be helpful.\nMuch would have happened, but from the very first day when you wrote to me that you would like your own name given to you...\nWhatsoever I have given you... I gave you a name here so you had to follow that. Then you were constantly in negative moods. And you have not come here to improve upon others; nobody has asked you to take that much trouble. You are not here to improve other sannyasins or tell them how they should behave or what they should do. That is not your business at all. You have been here to do something for yourself. Why get distracted with these things?\nIf you get distracted with these things, for your whole life you will get distracted like that and you will become accidental. Through discussing and debating where can you reach? All these months you have been discussing and debating in your mind; what conclusions have you arrived at? You would have become even more confused than you were before! This can lead to such a style of life that one can become a mess.\nSo this time go. For one year in the Philippines follow your mind and follow it strictly so that you can see what can come out of it. Next time you come be here for three, four months, and just forget all about your mind. Just do what I say and see in those four months what is possible. Much is possible – you have the potential. But you have got into an egoistic knowledge trip and that is creating trouble.\n[A sannyasin says she feels she is being taken over by another sannyasin who has a stronger personality than her. Osho tells her to hold his foot, and he checks her energy.]\nIt has nothing to do with their energies – it has something to do with your opening. It is not that they are powerful and that’s why you become possessed. It is just that you are open and anything enters. When one is open, anything enters. You cannot open to certain things only. If you are open to me, you will be opening to everybody around here. It is like when you open the door the wind comes, the sun comes, a stray dog enters... all kinds of things enter. If you close the door then everything is closed.\nYour heart is opening slowly, slowly, and it is beautiful! It is opening for me but then a stray dog will also enter sometimes. So chase the dog out! Don’t be worried about it. Whenever you feel this again, just hold the locket in your hand and remember me. Just remember my foot in your hands and immediately it will be gone. It will take two, three weeks for you to know the knack of it. Whatsoever\nyou want to throw out, you will be able to and whatsoever you want to absorb, you will be able to absorb.\nThis happens to everybody when for the first time the heart starts opening. In fact, that’s why people have learned not to open: because opening creates trouble. You become open to the friend and to the foe, you become open to health and disease, you become open to positivity and you become open to negativity. And naturally negativity is far more in the world than positivity. That’s why people have decided – it is just an unconscious decision on their part – that to be open is to be in danger, because once in a while the friend will enter and ninety-nine percent of the time the foe. Once in a while love will enter and ninety-nine percent of the time only thorns. So what is the point? It is too much, it is not worth it. People remain closed. They avoid all kinds of situations. But then love is also avoided and they remain miserable.\nThis is going to happen to many people here. Once they start opening up they will be flooded by anything. You are open: somebody passes by and immediately the vibe takes possession of you. But the reason is because you are becoming open to me, because you are becoming more and more possessed by me. So the doors are open and sometimes you may not like somebody’s energy; it comes into you and you feel difficult with it. Just put the locket in your hands, remember my foot. You will be able to even touch it, to almost feel it. And immediately the feeling will be gone.\nThat’s why I am so interested in creating a commune as fast as possible – so that you need not go outside at all. Slowly, slowly, my people will start raising their consciousness higher and higher so nobody, even if you become flooded by anybody, will be felt as bad. It will be a joy. You will thank him, that he has given something beautiful to you by passing.\nThat is what a commune means: where people are living a totally different kind of life, vibrating on a different plane. So each helps the other and everybody becomes a great tidal wave for each other. They can ride on each other’s energies and can go on moving as far as they wish. And nobody needs to go outside.\nJust a few more days... But start this and within three weeks, things will be settling. But things are good. You should be happy really.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2805","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/let_go/part18/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/let_go/>Let Go!</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">18</h1><div class=post-meta>14 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2805 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Let_Go/part18.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part17>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

the victory that comes from the outside, because that victory brings

only through love and meditation together. So when you are</p><p><br></p><p>feeling like being alone, meditate; then forget everything else. Soon
the desire will arise to relate, to be loved, to love. Then forget all
about the inner. Move totally into the other and let that moment be as
deep as possible. Go into the other deeply and y</p><p><br></p><p>you will be surprised that going deeply into the other helps you to
go deeply into yourself. Then go deeply into yourself and you will be
amazed that the deeper :you go into yourself, the more capable you
become of loving.</p><p><br></p><p>That is my definition of a saint, so you need not be worried what I
say about saints. I am creating a new kind of saint!</p><p><br></p><p>[The sannyasin says he will be back when the new commune starts in
Gujarat.]</p><p><br></p><p>Gujarat seems to be difficult – the government has created too much
difficulty. It may not happen.…</p><p><br></p><p>The commune is going to happen, but somewhere else. It may not be
near the sea. They are afraid to give me a place near the sea. They
think that will create trouble for them. I can relate with people
directly or with some other countries; that is their fear. People can
come directly to me by the sea route, that is... So they will not allow
me to go to the sea coast.</p><p><br></p><p>You have to drop that idea. You can come any time, when you want.</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin says he’s returning to his small holding. He loves the
way of life there – tending animals, growing things – but he doesn’t
earn any money so doesn’t know when he’ll be able to come back to see
you. So no need, you tell him. I will come and visit you!]</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin, who is leaving, says: I cannot comprehend your words
because of my mind. You say something, my mind says something else.
Something in me tries to debate every time.]</p><p><br></p><p>Mm mm, so you continue! This is your life and whatsoever you want to
do with it, do. You have wasted the whole time you have been here,
utterly wasted it. But this is your life and if you want to waste it,
waste it.</p><p><br></p><p>You have not listened to me, you have not done anything according to
me – from the very beginning you came, you started. I gave you some name
then immediately you said ‘I don’t want this name.’ You have the name
that you wanted, not my name. That day I knew that you would waste time.
These are small gestures that show what kind of person one is. Then you
have been constantly in conflict with the ashram, with people, with
everything. But this is your life – nothing can be forced on you. You
have to see the point: that you have been here for all these months and
you have missed. You have not gained anything. If you think you have
gained something out of your doubts, negativity, then it is perfectly
good: continue the doubts and continue the negativity. I am not against
it. But if you feel that you have not gained anything out of it, then
next time you come don’t listen to it.</p><p><br></p><p>One has to be very clear, because life can be wasted. If you already
think that you know what is true and what is right, then there is no
need to bother to listen to me at all. Why bother ? If you know what is
truth and if you know how One should live and what one should do, there
is no need to bother about me. Why waste time? Live your truth!</p><p><br></p><p>If you don’t know, then listen to me and do the things that I’m
telling you to do; don’t bring your mind in. Either this way or that –
one has to be very decisive. Otherwise you are neither following your
mind nor me. So you will be just in the middle and unnecessarily
puzzled, confused, dragged from this polarity to that. One moment you
will think this is right, another moment you will think that is
right.</p><p><br></p><p>You have to give it a try. If you think your mind is on the right
lines, then for one year don’t listen to anybody, don’t read anything.
Just listen to your mind and follow it. And one year’s experiment will
be decisive; it will show you whether your mind can lead you somewhere.
If it docs, so far so good! With all my blessings go with it. If you
think that the time is wasted and your mind leads nowhere – you simply
go round and round in circles and you remain where you were – then jump
out of it! Have the courage to jump out of it. What you are doing is
trying to do both. And that will not be helpful.</p><p><br></p><p>Much would have happened, but from the very first day when you wrote
to me that you would like your own name given to you...</p><p><br></p><p>Whatsoever I have given you... I gave you a name here so you had to
follow that. Then you were constantly in negative moods. And you have
not come here to improve upon others; nobody has asked you to take that
much trouble. You are not here to improve other sannyasins or tell them
how they should behave or what they should do. That is not your business
at all. You have been here to do something for yourself. Why get
distracted with these things?</p><p><br></p><p>If you get distracted with these things, for your whole life you will
get distracted like that and you will become accidental. Through
discussing and debating where can you reach? All these months you have
been discussing and debating in your mind; what conclusions have you
arrived at? You would have become even more confused than you were
before! This can lead to such a style of life that one can become a
mess.</p><p><br></p><p>So this time go. For one year in the Philippines follow your mind and
follow it strictly so that you can see what can come out of it. Next
time you come be here for three, four months, and just forget all about
your mind. Just do what I say and see in those four months what is
possible. Much is possible – you have the potential. But you have got
into an egoistic knowledge trip and that is creating trouble.</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin says she feels she is being taken over by another
sannyasin who has a stronger personality than her. Osho tells her to
hold his foot, and he checks her energy.]</p><p><br></p><p>It has nothing to do with their energies – it has something to do
with your opening. It is not that they are powerful and that’s why you
become possessed. It is just that you are open and anything enters. When
one is open, anything enters. You cannot open to certain things only. If
you are open to me, you will be opening to everybody around here. It is
like when you open the door the wind comes, the sun comes, a stray dog
enters... all kinds of things enter. If you close the door then
everything is closed.</p><p><br></p><p>Your heart is opening slowly, slowly, and it is beautiful! It is
opening for me but then a stray dog will also enter sometimes. So chase
the dog out! Don’t be worried about it. Whenever you feel this again,
just hold the locket in your hand and remember me. Just remember my foot
in your hands and immediately it will be gone. It will take two, three
weeks for you to know the knack of it. Whatsoever</p><p><br></p><p>you want to throw out, you will be able to and whatsoever you want to
absorb, you will be able to absorb.</p><p><br></p><p>This happens to everybody when for the first time the heart starts
opening. In fact, that’s why people have learned not to open: because
opening creates trouble. You become open to the friend and to the foe,
you become open to health and disease, you become open to positivity and
you become open to negativity. And naturally negativity is far more in
the world than positivity. That’s why people have decided – it is just
an unconscious decision on their part – that to be open is to be in
danger, because once in a while the friend will enter and ninety-nine
percent of the time the foe. Once in a while love will enter and
ninety-nine percent of the time only thorns. So what is the point? It is
too much, it is not worth it. People remain closed. They avoid all kinds
of situations. But then love is also avoided and they remain
miserable.</p><p><br></p><p>This is going to happen to many people here. Once they start opening
up they will be flooded by anything. You are open: somebody passes by
and immediately the vibe takes possession of you. But the reason is
because you are becoming open to me, because you are becoming more and
more possessed by me. So the doors are open and sometimes you may not
like somebody’s energy; it comes into you and you feel difficult with
it. Just put the locket in your hands, remember my foot. You will be
able to even touch it, to almost feel it. And immediately the feeling
will be gone.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why I am so interested in creating a commune as fast as
possible – so that you need not go outside at all. Slowly, slowly, my
people will start raising their consciousness higher and higher so
nobody, even if you become flooded by anybody, will be felt as bad. It
will be a joy. You will thank him, that he has given something beautiful
to you by passing.</p><p><br></p><p>That is what a commune means: where people are living a totally
different kind of life, vibrating on a different plane. So each helps
the other and everybody becomes a great tidal wave for each other. They
can ride on each other’s energies and can go on moving as far as they
wish. And nobody needs to go outside.</p><p><br></p><p>Just a few more days... But start this and within three weeks, things
will be settling. But things are good. You should be happy really.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part17>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

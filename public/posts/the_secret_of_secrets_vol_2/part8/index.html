Every child is born intelligent, then made stupid by the society. We educate him in stupidity. Sooner or later he graduates in stupidity.\nIntelligence is a natural phenomenon – just as breathing is, just as seeing is. Intelligence is the inner seeing; it is intuitive. It has nothing to do with intellect, remember. Never confuse intellect with intelligence, they are polar opposites. Intellect is of the head; it is taught by others, it is imposed on you. You have to cultivate it. It is borrowed, it is something foreign, it is not inborn.\nBut intelligence is inborn. It is your very being, your very nature. All animals are intelligent. They are not intellectuals, true, but they are all intelligent. Trees are intelligent, the whole existence is intelligent, and each child born is born intelligent. Have you ever come across a child who is stupid? It is impossible! But to come across a grown-up person who is intelligent is very rare; something goes wrong in between.\nI would like you to listen to this beautiful story. It may help. The story is called ‘The Animal School’.\nThe animals got together in the forest one day and decided to start a school. There was a rabbit, a bird, a squirrel, a fish and an eel, and they formed a Board of Directors. The rabbit insisted that\nrunning be in the curriculum. The bird insisted that flying be in the curriculum. The fish insisted that swimming had to be in the curriculum, and the squirrel said that perpendicular tree-climbing was absolutely necessary to the curriculum. They put all of these things together and wrote a curriculum guide. Then they insisted that ALL of the animals take ALL of the subjects.\nAlthough the rabbit was getting an A in running, perpendicular tree-climbing was a real problem for him. He kept falling over backwards. Pretty soon he got to be sort of brain-damaged and he could not run anymore. He found that instead of making an A in running he was making a C, and of course he always made an F in perpendicular climbing. The bird was really beautiful at flying, but when it came to burrowing in the ground he could not do so well. He kept breaking his beak and wings. Pretty soon he was making a C in flying as well as an F in burrowing, and he had a hell of a time with perpendicular tree-climbing.\nThe moral of the story is that the person who was valedictorian of the class was a mentally-retarded eel who did everything in a half-way fashion. But the educators were all happy because everybody was taking all of the subjects, and it was called a ‘broad-based education’.\nWe laugh at this, but that’s what it is. It is what you did. We really are trying to make everybody the same as everybody else, hence destroying everybody’s potential for being himself.\nIntelligence dies in imitating others. If you want to remain intelligent you will have to drop imitating. Intelligence commits suicide in copying, in becoming a carbon copy. The moment you start thinking how to be like that person you are falling from your intelligence, you are becoming stupid. The moment you compare yourself with somebody else you are losing your natural potential. Now you will never be happy, and you will never be clean, clear, transparent. You will lose your clarity, you will lose your vision. You will have borrowed eyes; but how can you see through somebody else’s eyes? You need your own eyes, you need your own legs to walk, your own heart to beat.\nPeople are living a borrowed life, hence their life is paralyzed. This paralysis makes them look very stupid.\nA totally new kind of education is needed in the world. The person who is born to be a poet is proving himself stupid in mathematics and the person who could have been a great mathematician is just cramming history and feeling lost. Everything is topsy-turvy because education is not according to your nature. It does not pay any respect to the individual, it forces everybody into a certain pattern. Maybe by accident the pattern fits a few people but the majority is lost and the majority lives in misery.\nThe greatest misery in life is to feel oneself stupid, unworthy, unintelligent. And nobody is born unintelligent; nobody can be born unintelligent because we come from God. God is pure intelligence. We bring some flavor, some fragrance from God when we come into the world. But immediately the society jumps upon you, starts manipulating, teaching, changing, cutting, adding, and soon you have lost all shape, all form. The society wants you to be obedient, conformist, orthodox. This is how your intelligence is destroyed.\nMy whole approach is to take you out of this imposed pattern. This is a prison cell in which you are living. You can drop it. It will be difficult to drop because you have become so accustomed to it. It\nwill be difficult to drop because it is not just like clothing; it has become almost your skin, you have lived with it so long. It will be difficult to drop because this is your whole identity – but it has to be dropped if you really want to claim your real being.\nIf you really want to be intelligent you have to be a rebel. Only the rebellious person is intelligent. What do I mean by rebellion? – I mean dropping all that has been enforced on you against your will. Search again for who you are, start from ABC again. Think that your time, up to now, has been a wastage because you have been following.\nNo person is similar to anybody else, each is unique – that is the nature of intelligence – and each is incomparable. Don’t compare yourself to anybody. How can you compare? You are you and the other is other. You are not similar, so comparison is not possible.\nBut we have been taught to compare and we are continuously comparing. Directly, indirectly, consciously, unconsciously, we live in comparison. And if you compare you will never respect yourself: somebody is more beautiful than you, somebody is taller than you, somebody is healthier than you, and somebody is something else; somebody has such a musical voice... and you will be burdened and burdened if you go on comparing. Millions of people are there; you will be crushed by your comparisons.\nAnd you had a beautiful soul, a beautiful being which wanted to bloom, which wanted to become a Golden Flower, but you never allowed it. Be unburdened. Put all aside. Regain, reclaim your innocence, your childhood. Jesus is right when he says, “Unless you are born again, you shall not enter into my kingdom of God.”\nI say the same to you: Unless you are born AGAIN.…\nLet your sannyas be a new birth! Drop all the garbage that has been put on you! Be fresh! Start from the very beginning, and you will be surprised – how much intelligence is immediately released.\nPunita, you ask, “What exactly is intelligence?”\nIt is capacity to see, capacity to understand, capacity to live your own life according to your own nature. That is what intelligence is.\nAnd what is stupidity? Following others, imitating others, obeying others, looking through their eyes, trying to imbibe their knowledge as your knowledge: that is stupidity.\nThat’s why pundits are almost always stupid people. They are parrots, they repeat. They are gramophone records. They can repeat skillfully, but let a new situation arise, that which is not written in their books, and they are at a loss. They don’t have any intelligence.\nIntelligence is the capacity to respond moment-to-moment to life as it happens, not according to a program. Only unintelligent people have a program. They are afraid; they know that they don’t have enough intelligence to encounter life as it is. They have to be ready, they rehearse. They prepare the answer before the question has been raised, and that’s how they prove themselves stupid – because the question is never the same. The question is always new. Each day brings its own problems, its\nown challenges and each moment brings its own questions. And if you have ready-made answers in your head you will not be able even to listen to the question. You will be so full of your answer, you will be incapable of listening. You will not be available. And whatsoever you will do you will do according to your ready-made answer – which is irrelevant, which has no relationship with the reality as it is.\nIntelligence is: to relate with reality, unprepared. And the beauty of facing life unprepared is tremendous. Then life has a newness, a youth; then life has a flow and freshness. Then life has so many surprises. And when life has so many surprises boredom never settles in you.\nThe stupid person is always bored. He is bored because of the answers that he has gathered from others and goes on repeating. He is bored because his eyes are so full of knowledge, he cannot see what is happening. He knows too much without knowing at all. He is not wise, he is only knowledgeable. When he looks at a roseflower, he does not look at THIS roseflower. All the roseflowers that he has read about, all the roseflowers that the poets have talked about, all the roseflowers that painters have painted and philosophers have discussed, and all the roseflowers that he had heard about, they are standing in his eyes – a great queue of memories, information. THIS roseflower that is there is lost in that queue, in that crowd. He cannot see it. He simply repeats; he says, “This roseflower is beautiful.” Those words are also not his own, not authentic, not sincere, not true. Somebody else’s voice... he is just playing a tape.\nStupidity is repetition, repeating others. It is cheap, cheap because you need not learn. Learning is arduous. It needs guts to learn. Learning means one has to be humble. Learning means one has to be ready to drop the old, one has to be constantly ready to accept the new. Learning means a non-egoistic state.\nAnd one never knows where learning will lead you. One cannot predict about the learner; his life will remain unpredictable. He himself cannot predict what is going to happen tomorrow, where he will be tomorrow. He moves in a state of no-knowledge. Only when you live in a state of no-knowledge, a CONSTANT state of no-knowledge, do you learn.\nThat’s why children learn beautifully. As they grow old they stop learning, because knowledge gathers and it is cheap to repeat it. Why bother? It is cheap, simple, to follow the pattern, to move in a circle. But then boredom settles. Stupidity and boredom go together.\nThe intelligent person is as fresh as dewdrops in the morning sun, as fresh as the stars in the night. You can feel his newness, so new, like a breeze.\nIntelligence is the capacity to be reborn again and again. To die to the past is intelligence, and to live in the present is intelligence.\nAnd, Punita, you also ask, “What is the relationship of intelligence of the heart to the intelligence of the mind?”\nThey are diametrically opposite. The intelligence of the head is not intelligence at all; it is knowledgeability. The intelligence of the heart is the intelligence, the only intelligence there is. The head is simply an accumulator. It is always old, it is never new, it is never original. It is good for\ncertain purposes: for filing it is perfectly good. And in life one needs this – many things have to be remembered. The mind, the head, is a biocomputer. You can go on accumulating knowledge in it and whenever you need you can take it out. It is good for mathematics, good for calculation, good for the day-to-day life, the marketplace; but if you think this is your whole life then you will remain stupid. You will never know the beauty of feeling and you will never know the blessing of the heart. And you will never know the grace that descends only through the heart, the God that enters only through the heart. You will never know prayer, you will never know poetry, you will never know love.\nThe intelligence of the heart creates poetry in your life, gives dance to your steps, makes your life a joy, a celebration, a festivity, a laughter. It gives you a sense of humor. It makes you capable of love, of sharing. That is true life. The life that is lived from the head is a mechanical life. You become a robot – maybe very efficient; robots are very efficient, machines are more efficient than man. You can earn much through the head, but you will not live much. You may have a better standard of living but you won’t have any life.\nLife is of the heart. Life can only grow through the heart. It is the soil of the heart where love grows, life grows, God grows. All that is beautiful, all that is really valuable, all that is meaningful, significant, comes through the heart. The heart is your very center, the head is just your periphery. To live in the head is to live on the circumference without ever becoming aware of the beauties and the treasures of the center. To live on the periphery is stupidity. You ask, “What is stupidity?”\nTo live in the head is stupidity. To live in the heart and USE the head whenever needed is intelligence. But the center, the Master, is at the very core of your being. The Master is the heart, and the head is just a servant: this is intelligence. When the head becomes the Master and forgets all about the heart, that is stupidity.\nIt is up to you to choose. Remember, the head as a slave is a beautiful slave, of much utility, but as a master is a dangerous master and will destroy your whole life, will poison your whole life. Look around! People’s lives are absolutely poisoned, poisoned by the head. They cannot feel, they are no more sensitive, nothing thrills them. The sun rises but nothing rises in them; they look at the sun empty-eyed. The sky becomes full of the stars – the marvel, the mystery! – but nothing stirs in their hearts, no song arises. Birds sing, man has forgotten to sing. Clouds come in the sky and the peacocks dance, and man does not know how to dance. He has become a cripple. Trees bloom.… Man thinks, never feels, and without feeling there is no flowering possible.\nThe Golden Flower that we have been talking about this whole month is there in you, waiting – waiting for centuries, for lives. When are you going to give attention to it so that it can bloom? And unless a man becomes a Golden Flower what the yogis have called the ‘one-thousand-petalled lotus’, sahasrar – unless your life becomes an opening, one thousand petals open and the fragrance is released, you will have lived in vain, “a tale told by an idiot, full of fury and noise, signifying nothing”.\nWatch, scrutinize, observe, have another look at your life. Nobody else is going to help you. You have depended on others so long; that’s why you have become stupid. Now, take care; it is your own responsibility. You OWE it to yourself to have a deep penetrating look at what you are doing with your life. Is there any poetry in your heart? If it is not there, then don’t waste time. Help your heart to weave and spin poetry. Is there any romance in your life or not? If there is not, then you are dead, then you are already in your grave.\nCome OUT of it! Let life have something of the romantic in it, something like adventure. Explore! Millions of beauties and splendors are waiting for you. You go on moving around and around, never entering into the temple of life. The door is the heart.\nSo I say: the real intelligence is of the heart. It is not intellectual, it is emotional. It is not like thinking, it is like feeling. It is not logic, it is love.\nThe second question:\nQuestion 2\nWHAT IS IT IN THE MAKE-UP OF SOMEONE LIKE EVA RENZI THAT MAKES HER TELL SUCH OUTRAGEOUS LIES ABOUT A COMMUNITY LIKE OURS?\nI feel sorry for Eva Renzi. She was really in great need. She has missed an opportunity. She must be suffering from a split personality. She is not one, she is two. She is schizophrenic. That’s why she had come in search, to find some clarity, some integration.\nShe has been in psychotherapy, she has been psychoanalyzed, but the psychoanalysis has not been of much help. That’s why her husband suggested that she come here. The husband also has not been able to live with her, they are separated.\nAnd just the other day I was reading a statement by one of the directors – she is a film actress – and the director remembers that ten or twelve years ago he was directing a film and she was the heroine in the film. They had booked a beautiful castle somewhere in Germany for only one day. And the whole crew waited and all the actors waited, and Eva Renzi never turned up! Almost in tears, everybody left. And in the evening she turned up, laughing, smiling. And the director says he became so crazy that he hit her with a chair! And then he felt bad too. He had a heart attack; for three, four months he had to rest. He says that anybody who can live for one hour with Eva Renzi will hit her!\nNow the poor woman must have been in deep suffering. She is crazy! She would have been immensely helped if she had been a little patient, if she had been here a little longer.\nBut these patterns go very deep. These patterns go so deep that it is almost impossible to help such people.\nShe was in one group, Centering; she created trouble there – and she was creating so much trouble that the whole group was disturbed. And you cannot allow one hundred and twenty-five people to be disturbed for one person. So Prasad, the group leader, had to tell her that if she was so angry, in a rage, so much in violence, that it would be better that she should participate in the Encounter group where she could release her anger, her rage, cathart, but the Centering group was not for her.\nShe immediately left and entered into the Encounter group, and within hours she was gone – because there also she created much trouble, provoked everybody to fight. The Encounter group is meant for release, and when people started fighting with her she left the group.\nNow the other personality must have taken possession of her. She did not report to the police here in Poona. If there had been something wrong with her she should have gone to the police. She went to police in Bombay and reported that she had been beaten – so much so that the room was full of blood – her clothes had been torn apart and she had to go out of the ashram naked to the hotel! Now, do you think a beautiful woman like Eva Renzi walking naked on the Poona streets would have survived? Nobody remembers a naked woman in the ‘Blue Diamond’, bleeding and going there; nobody had seen her. There are thousands of people here the whole day: nobody had seen her going and leaving, naked, bleeding, shouting, crying; nobody had seen her. She reported to the police in Bombay, not here. And the police came and searched and found the whole thing was a lie.\nBut I don’t think that she is lying; it is her other personality, her other self. The other person had taken possession of her, not that she was lying knowingly. When the other person takes possession, it becomes impossible – you don’t know what you are saying, why you are saying it.\nThe people who are split function almost like two persons. When they are in one personality they are one person, when they are in another personality they are a different person, and both personalities never meet.\nNow she has created much fuss in Germany, in the newspapers, but I feel real compassion for her. I invite her again. I have not seen her. All this just happened within a day, I have not seen her. I would like to see her and help her; she needs help. And she has gone so deeply into this schizophrenia that I don’t think she can be helped anywhere else. If she comes back it will be good: those two personalities can be welded again. But it will need patience. If she had come with her husband or some friends it would have been better. They would have prevented her from escaping so soon.\nA little time will be needed. A lifelong pattern can’t be changed in one day. And the schizophrenics have their own ideas about things. They are so full of their own madness that they think everybody else is mad. Their projections are such, they feel that they are being persecuted, everybody is going to murder them or kill them.\nOnce it happened :I had to live in the same room with a professor for a few months. He was a schizophrenic. When he was good he was utterly good, a really nice fellow, but when he was bad he was really bad. And it was very difficult to know when he was going to be good, when he was going to be bad. In the middle of the night he would start shouting or would start provoking me to fight with him. If you didn’t fight, you didn’t honor him. If you didn’t start fighting, then he would be angry. If you fought him you unnecessarily got into trouble with him. And then the neighbors would come, and he would shout and he would make such fuss. And by the morning he would have forgotten everything! If you reminded him he would say, “No, you must have dreamt it.” If you called the neighbors he would say, “They must have been dreaming, because I have slept so well the whole night.” It was so difficult. I would go to the university to teach; when I would come home all my things would be gone!\nHe had two personalities. The other personality was really something! He would store everything in his suitcases and lock them. When he was good he would be very generous, he would give his things to me. I enjoyed living with him for a few months because it was such a surprise – you never knew what was going to happen today. And when he was in his bad personality, in the neurotic, he was so afraid, that anything... and he would think the murderer was coming or the police were coming to catch hold of him. And he would imagine: just a jeep passing by in the middle of the night\n– he would wake me up. He would say, “Look, the police are reaching, the jeep has come. Now I will be caught. And I tell you that I am innocent! And I have not done anything wrong – you are my witness!” Just the whistle of the police in the night and he would be alerted.\nThese people are in deep suffering. They have their own ideas, and they are so clouded in their ideas that they don’t see the reality.\nNow I don’t think she is aware at all of what she is saying, of what she is reporting to the newspapers. She says one man, an old man, a Dutchman – he is none other than the famous author, Amrito – tried to rape her. Now he will be the last man to think of rape; she is just like a daughter to him. And such a nice, loving person. But somehow she had got the idea that there was an old Dutchman in the Encounter group who wanted to rape her. Now she is going around telling people, the newspapers. But the idea had got into her, and newspapers are always ready to exploit anything.\nA man came home to find his wife having a nervous breakdown, screaming and banging her head on the wall.\n“What is the matter, darling?” said the worried husband. “I am homesick!” sobbed the distraught woman.\n“But you are at home, darling,” said the husband. “Exactly!” said the wife, “I am sick of home!”\nWhen you have your ideas, your own interpretations, things start appearing like that. And you can always find explanations, excuses; you can always find arguments. And remember, neurotic people are very argumentative because they are hung-up in the head.\nSo don’t feel angry with Eva Renzi, not at all. And don’t be worried about what is happening in Germany. It is going to help my work tremendously! I know my business and how to do it; don’t be worried about it.\nNow it is all over Germany. EVERYBODY knows my name – this is something great – and everybody is asking about me, “Who is this man?” Sannyasins who have come from Germany just a few days ago report that even taxi-drivers ask, “Are you going to Poona? I am also thinking of going! What is happening there?”\nNow many people will be coming because of Eva Renzi. And remember, there is always a balance, otherwise life would collapse. Her negative statements started creating positive statements. That’s how it always happens. That’s what I mean when I say I know my business. Now this director has come to defend me. He does not know me, but he says that if it has happened to Eva Renzi it is perfectly good; she needed it, she deserved it! He says all the people who knew her will be happy – particularly her husband. Now more and more positive statements will be coming.\nJust create the negative and the positive starts coming. Create the positive and the negative starts coming. They always balance, otherwise life would collapse. So never be worried about negative things; it is always like that.\nDo you know who created Christianity? – not Christ, but the people who crucified him. If they had not crucified him there would have been no Christianity, you would never have even heard of Jesus. It is the people who crucified him. Now crucifixion is such a negativity that the positive is bound to happen. Now somebody is bound to start worshipping; then the balance. Life always balances.\nSo the poor woman is in suffering but it is good for my work. Nothing is wrong in it. Those lies that she is telling will be refuted from many unknown quarters. People will come up on their own, and many people will come just out of curiosity. Many more lies will follow, and many more truths to balance them. Now, because she started the thing, many newspapers have come to Poona. Since she started the ball rolling, many newspapers, many journalists have come. A few have written against, a few have written for.\nOne journalist seems to be really very inventive. He writes that he reached to the ashram-gate door at five thirty, early in the morning. He knocked on the door. A great beauty, a blonde, opened the door – at five thirty! – and welcomed him with an apple, or something like an apple. He said, “I don’t know what fruit it was. She gave the fruit to me and she said, ‘You are welcome in the Garden of the Master. Come in!’ And I asked, ‘What is this apple?’ and she said, ‘You eat it. It will give you sexual energy.”’\nNow the taxi-drivers are asking, “Are there such types of fruits in the garden? We would like to come.” Who would not like to come! Let these people work. They are helping my work; nothing to be worried about. I always rejoice!\nThe third question:\nQuestion 3\nWHAT IS YOUR MESSAGE, OSHO? I DON’T UNDERSTAND YOU.\nMy message is that there is no message. I am not here to give you a message, because a message will become knowledge. I am here to impart something of my being. It is not a message, it is a gift. It is not a theory, it is not a philosophy. I want you to partake of my being. It cannot be reduced into a dogma. You cannot go back and tell people what you have learned here; you will not be able to. If you have learned anything you will not be able to relate it to anybody, although your whole being will show it. You will not be able to say it but only to show it. Your eyes will show it, your face will beam, your whole energy will have a different vibe.\nI am not functioning here as a teacher. This is not a school. I don’t teach you a thing. I simply want you to participate with me, in this mystery that has happened to me. Fall in tune with my energy, vibrate with me, pulsate with me – and you will know something which is beyond words, which no message can contain.\nOnce the great Master Joshu was asked for his word. Joshu said, “There is not even half a word.” When he was asked further, “Master, but are you not here?” he said, “I am not a word.”\nHe is right. A Master is not a word, a Master is a door. A Master is not a message but a medium. A Master is a link, a bridge. Pass through the door, pass through the bridge, and you will come to\nknow exactly what life is all about. If you can dive deep into the Master you will start feeling the presence of God – but it is not a message.\nAnd you say you don’t understand me. I know why you can’t understand me: because whatsoever I am saying is so simple, that is why. Had it been complex you would have understood it. You are accustomed to complexity: the more complex a thing is, the more your intellect starts working on it. The challenge to the ego...\nMy communion with you is so simple, so utterly simple that there is no challenge for the ego; that is the reason why you can’t understand me. What I say is simple and absolutely clear. I don’t use any jargon. I am simply using the language that you use in your day-to-day work, in your day-to-day life. Maybe that is the reason for your not understanding me. The obvious is what I say and teach – yes, the obvious – but the obvious sounds bizarre because you have become so accustomed to the complexities that the mad mind goes on spinning and weaving around you.\nAnd moreover, always keep in mind that what I say is said for no particular reason. There is no motive behind it. Just as they say ‘art for art’s sake’, what I am saying to you has no particular reason behind it, no motive, but a sheer joy of being together with you, a sheer response to your questions. Not that my answers will solve your questions; no, not at all. If my answers can solve your questions, then it becomes a message. My answers will only help you to understand your questions – and when a question is understood, it dissolves. No question is ever solved. If you understand a question rightly it dissolves, it is not solved. It becomes insignificant, trivial and false, like a dry leaf from the tree. It loses all meaning. I am not going to give you answers, I am going to take away your questions.\nAnd when the mind has no question to ask, in that utter silence where no question is present, you come to know that which is – call it God, call it Tao, truth, NIRVANA, or what you will.\nThat’s why I say there is no particular reason in my saying whatsoever I say to you. There is no particular motive behind it, it is a simple response to your being. I am only being a mirror, hence there is no particular need to understand me. Don’t try to understand me. There is nothing to understand. Just be with me and understanding will come on its own. And these are two different types of understandings.\nWhen you try to understand me you will miss, because while I am imparting something to you, you are engaged and occupied in understanding it. You will miss it. Don’t try to understand it, just listen! Just as I am talking to you without any motive, listen on your part without any motive – and the meeting is bound to happen. When I am without motive and you are without motive, what can hinder, what can obstruct the meeting? Then the meeting is going to happen. And in that communion is understanding; in that communion is light, clarity, transparency.\nSo rather than trying to understand me, celebrate me, rejoice in me – and you will understand, and without any effort to understand.\nNobody ever understands through effort. What effort do you make when you listen to music? Do you try to understand it? If you try to understand it, you will miss the whole joy of it. The music has to be rejoiced in. Do you try to understand a dance? Then you will miss it. The dance has to be\ncelebrated. Do you try to understand the roseflowers and the songs of the birds in the morning? There is no need! Just be with the roseflower, just see the bird on the wing. Don’t let anything hinder, and suddenly, understanding arises. That understanding arises from the heart, from your intelligence. It is not of the head.\nAnd then the understanding has a totally different flavor, a totally different fragrance to it. Then it has beauty – because it comes out of effortlessness, it comes out of love. If you try to understand me, logic will be there, mind will be there. If you don’t try to understand me, if you just listen for the sake of listening, then slowly, slowly something starts opening in you, arising in you, awakening in you.\nLet me be a provocation, not a message. Let me be an alarm to wake you up, not a message. If you think in terms of a message you will create a wall between me and you. Just be here. Just as I am with you, you be with me – for no particular reason, just for the sheer joy of this silence, this presence that surrounds me and you, that joins me and you, this meditativeness, this grace, this moment of sheer beauty and benediction.\nAnd your heart will understand. Whether your mind understands or not is of no significance. The fifth question:\nQuestion 4\nMORARJI DESAI SAYS THAT STUDENTS SHOULD NOT TAKE PART IN POLITICS. WHAT DO YOU SAY ABOUT IT?\nRemember always: whatsoever the politicians say, it is always politics. Whenever a politician reaches to power he always starts telling the students not to participate in politics – but only when he is in power. When he is not in power he is all in favor – students SHOULD participate in politics.\nHow has Morarji reached to power? Basically, it was a students’ movement in Gujarat and Bihar; on that tidal wave of the youth movement he has reached to power. Now he must be afraid; now if students continue to participate in politics he can be toppled.\nThis is something beautiful to be understood: whenever politicians are out of power they provoke the students. The same politicians, when they reach to power, they start telling the students, “Please, this is not your work. You should go to the colleges, to the universities. Politics has to be avoided. Don’t be distracted by politics!” Because that is the bridge, that bridge has to be broken. Otherwise others will be coming. And students cannot be befooled so easily as others can be befooled. Youth cannot be befooled as easily as others can be befooled because youth is still not involved in the vested interests of the society. The older you grow the more your investment is in the status quo; you cannot go against it. You are married, you have children, you have a job, you have to look after the family, and there are a thousand and one responsibilities on you. You would like everything to remain as it is, you will be afraid of any change. Who knows? – your job is lost, and what is going to happen to your children?\nStudents prove to be the most revolutionary part of the society for the simple reason that they have no investment; for the simple reason that they can ask for, demand, change. And of course they are\nyoung; their eyes can still see a little bit. They can still feel. And of course they are going to live in the future. The past is not their world, but the future. The older you grow the less future you have and the more past. A man of seventy has very little future and a very long past. And the man who is only twenty has very little past and a long future; his orientation is the future. And whenever the future is the orientation there is rebellion, revolution.\nAnd the people who are in power are always afraid of any kind of rebellion, of any kind of revolution.\nSo remember, when politicians say, “Participate in politics,” then too it is politics. When they say, “Don’t participate in politics,” then too it is politics. They always speak politics, whatsoever they say. Even in their sleep, if they start saying something, it is politics – don’t believe them! Even in their dreams they remain politicians.\nBut they are cunning people, shrewd people: whenever there is a revolution, whenever there is some change, some movement, and the youth is stirred, the shrewd politicians simply ride on the wave.\nNow this revolution that happened just one and a half years ago was created by the youth, and the power went into the hands of the very rotten old. This is strange – that the stir was of the youth but the people who came into power are all above seventy, and a few are even above eighty. One sometimes wonders why dead people can’t get out of their graves and become prime ministers and presidents... they will prove to be even better!\nI was reading a story:\nThree old friends met for lunch one day. Well advanced in years, they met periodically to keep up to date on each other. The youngest of the three told his news first. His wife had just given him a baby girl – and he was almost seventy-nine years old!\nThe second man spoke. He was eighty-three years of age and his wife had just had a son. The two fathers were proud as peacocks.\nThen the third man offered some food for thought. “My friends,” he said, “let me tell you a story. I am eighty-eight. Used to hunt a lot, but I am too old for that nonsense now. But last week I was strolling in the park and a cottontail came bounding out of the bushes. True to an old instinct, I raised my walking cane to shooting position, cried, ‘Bang! Bang!’ and the rabbit rolled over dead!\n“A few minutes later I spied another cottontail. Again I simulated a rifle with my cane and cried ‘Bang!’ Again the rabbit dropped dead!\n“What necromancy, what strange spell is this? I wondered aloud. Then, gentlemen, I glanced behind – ten paces to the rear was a young boy shooting with a real rifle!”\nMorarji Desai should ponder over it: your ‘bang! bang!’ has not done anything; just the youth of the country have been shooting behind you.\nBut now, naturally, once you have reached to power you become afraid. But you ask me, “What do you say about it?”\nI also say to you to avoid politics, don’t take part in politics – not for the same reason, of course. First, I am not a politician. Second, I am not in power. I have nothing to be afraid of in your taking part in politics. So, the reason why Morarji Desai says, “Don’t participate in politics,” is something else. The reason why I say to you, “Don’t participate in politics,” is totally different. The reason is: leave politics for the stupid people, the utterly stupid who cannot do anything else. First try to be a scientist, a poet, a painter, an architect, a musician, a novelist, a potter, a weaver, a carpenter – something intelligent, something creative. If you find that you cannot create anything; when you have looked around and tried everywhere, and everywhere you get ‘F’, then go into politics – that is the last resort of the stupid and the scoundrels – never before. First try; there are beautiful experiences in life. Politics is destructive. It is the most ugly phenomenon. Leave it to others who cannot do anything else. And remember, if you don’t leave it to others who cannot do anything else, those others will become criminals.\nThe criminal and the politician are the same type of people. If the criminal becomes politically successful he is a great leader. If the politician cannot succeed in being in power he becomes a criminal. They are destructive people: their whole effort is to dominate others.\nThe really creative person is not interested in dominating anybody. He is so utterly rejoicing in life – he wants to create, he wants to participate with God. Creativity is prayer. And whenever you create something, in those moments you are with God, you walk with God, you live in God. The more creative you are the more divine you are. To me, creativity is religion. Art is just the entrance to the temple of religion.\nCreate something! When you fail everywhere, then politics. It is not for the intelligent people, it is for the utterly unintelligent and stupid. And of course, they also need somewhere, some place to do some nonsense of their own. They need parliaments to quarrel in and go mad. Leave it to them!\nI also say to students: Don’t participate in politics unless you have failed everywhere else. First try other dimensions of life, far richer. But my reason is totally different.\nAnd if you become interested in politics too early you will remain retarded for your whole life. When are you going to read Kalidas and Shakespeare and Milton and Tennyson and Eliot and Pound? When are you going to see the great painters, learn their art? When are you going to meditate in Khajuraho, Konarak? When are you going to dream great dreams of creating a Taj Mahal or a painting or poetry? When? There is great literature, great painting, great poetry. Watch your steps.\nPolitics seems to be attractive for only one single reason, and that has to be understood.\nThe English word ‘self-consciousness’ has to be understood; that will help you. It has two meanings. One is the meaning which Buddha preaches and Gurdjieff preaches and I preach: it means to become conscious of yourself, become alert. Gurdjieff used the word ‘self-remembering’, and Buddha uses the words SAMA SMRATI, mindfulness, consciousness. Krishnamurti uses the word ‘awareness’ – become fully alert and aware. This is the one meaning of the word ‘self-conscious’. The word is very ambiguous.\nThe other meaning is when you stand on a stage and you become self-conscious, and you start trembling. The other meaning is pathological. The first meaning means you are conscious of\nyourself – you are not a robot, you function out of awareness. The second means that you are aware that OTHERS are conscious of you, that others are watching you, that you are an object of others’ consciousness – and you become afraid. So many people watching... if something goes wrong... and they will laugh and they will think you are a fool or ridiculous – and you become afraid. Others are watching you; you are an object. You become conscious of this phenomenon – conscious that others are conscious of you – then fear arises. But joy too arises – “So many people watching me” – so you repress your fear. You stand there on the stage without trembling: “So many people watching me...” The fear is: if something goes wrong they will think you are a fool. The joy is: “If nothing goes wrong, and I can perform well, then so many people will think, ‘Look! What a great man! What a great artist, actor, speaker, orator!’ If I can succeed in performing something, so many people will look towards me, upwards at me, and will enhance my ego.”\nThe politician lives in this. He wants many people to look up to him so his ego is enhanced. He is afraid of going within because he knows there is nothing, emptiness. He does not know who he is. He collects his information about himself from others’ eyes, from what they say. If they say “You are a great man” he believes he is a great man. He rides on the winds. If they say “You are a mahatma” he feels greatly happy, his ego is fulfilled. He is attaining a kind of identity – now he knows who he is. But this is not true self-knowledge; others can take it away any moment. And they always take, because sooner or later they can see that you have not fulfilled your promises, that your performance has been bogus.\nYou can see Morarji Desai’s great ego eroding by and by. You can see the same with Jimmy Carter – the smile becoming smaller and smaller, disappearing – because you cannot fulfill the promises that you have made to the people. And you always make big promises. Without making big promises you will not reach to power, so you give fantastic promises that you know you cannot fulfill – but who cares! Once you are in power, then we will see. Then we will see how they can take you out of power; you will cling, and you will have all the powers to cling and the whole bureaucracy and the whole government machinery will be with you. Once you are in power who cares about the promises? The leaders forget all about their promises. And don’t remind them! They feel very hurt and very annoyed.\nBut people start seeing that the promises are not being fulfilled: “These people have cheated us!” The image starts falling, the person becomes smaller. That hurts.\nThe politician is continuously in search of enhancing his ego. He needs others’ attention. Millions of people have to feed his ego. The artist, the mystic, the musician, the dancer – if they are also asking for others’ attention, then they are politicians. Then they are not real artists, not real mystics.\nThe real mystic, the real artist, is one who knows the other meaning of self-consciousness: he is simply conscious of himself. He does not need anybody else’s attention, he is enough unto himself. He can be silently sitting and enjoying himself; he does not need anybody. His life is of awareness, he moves with awareness, his each step is full of light. Hence he never repents, he never feels guilty. Whatsoever he does, he does with full awareness. All that he can do he does, and whatsoever happens he accepts – because that is the only thing that could have happened. He never looks back. He moves ahead and he lives in the present, but he lives in a very conscious way.\nSelf-consciousness in the meaning Buddha gives the word makes you a creator, and self- consciousness the way a politician needs it makes you just an egoist.\nI say to you: Don’t participate in politics because that is search ing for the ego. And to search for the ego is to search for something poisonous that will destroy your whole life. The politician is the poorest man in the world, the most empty man, the most hollow, stuffed with straw and nothing else.\nThe last question:\nQuestion 5\nWHEN CAN A THERAPY BE CALLED ‘FINISHED’?\nTherapy is the need of the divided person. Therapy is the need of the person who has fallen into fragments. Therapy is complete when you have become a whole, when you are one piece.\nBut no therapy, as it is known in the modern world, brings you to wholeness. Therapy is, at the most, nothing but a rearrangement – maybe a little better than before, but you remain fragmentary. It is the same furniture rearranged in the same room – maybe a little bit more conveniently – but it doesn’t make you whole, because when a person becomes whole his life becomes prayer.\nPrayer is the by-product of wholeness. Wholeness makes you holy. Unless your therapy brings prayer to your heart it is not complete yet. The basic need is that of prayer.\nJung is reported to have said – and his observation is absolutely right – that one half of his patients were in need not of therapy but of religion. He is also reported to have said – and again he is right – that all the patients that went to him who were above forty-two didn’t need therapy, but needed prayer.\nThe real need is to have a context in this infinite existence. The ego makes you separate; prayer dissolves the ego and you become one with existence again. To become one with existence is to attain to bliss. To remain separate, there is conflict. To remain separate means you are fighting with existence, you are not flowing with the river. You may even be trying to go upstream – and going upstream you are going to be frustrated, you are going to fail. Flowing with the river – so much so that you become one with the river, just a part of the river, you don’t have any will of your own, you are surrendered to the will of the total – this is prayer. And a therapy is complete, finished, when prayer is born in your heart.\nBut the prayer has to be true. It should not be a formality, it should not be a repetition, parrotlike. It should arise, it should have roots in your being.\nAnutosh has sent me a beautiful joke. Meditate over it.\nEvery day for six months the kneeling figure, hands clasped in prayer, had intoned the same pitiful story in the shadow of the back pews in his local Catholic church.\n“Oh Lord, sure I am only a poor simple fellow. Not even the price of a glass of wine do I have for after mass on Sunday, and I know I am a terribly wicked fellow. I give the missus a clout now and then, and when the kids get too much I have to rebuke them with the back of my hand.\n“But I am not asking for much, just a couple of quid in the old wage packet – not for myself, mind, just for the housekeeping to keep the old lady off my back and some sweets for the kids. Maybe the odd drink for me. I would not abuse it though, Lord. Can you help me? It would make an awful lot of difference, and I will ask for nothing more, to be sure. God bless, Hail Mary, Amen!”\nSuddenly the door of the church burst open and a smartly dressed West Indian swaggered down the aisle and took a defiant stance in front of the altar, and raising his fist shouted, “Hey dere, Lord. Now you listen here! I dun just got to dis country. I dun got nuttin, and dey ain’t about to give me no credit, so I dun come to you. I needs a li’l sugar-mama first. I dun need furs and jewels to dress her in, I needs a big car to drive her in, and I needs money to spend. So I want a big win on de horses and den a good investment, and I needs it double quick. So quit messing around and just get at it. I know you’se can do it Lord, I just knows”.\nTurning and striding out, he added, “I sure dig you man, I sure dig you.”\nSome weeks later the kneeling Catholic is still there, mumbling into his hands, when suddenly the doors burst open and the same West Indian, arms around a gorgeous girl, bops straight down to the altar and grinning from ear to ear, laughs, “I knews you could do it, Lord! I done got a Rolls Royce. I owns de racecourse now. Talk about winning hard, I got my pants full of money here. Say ‘thank you’ to the Lord, honey.” “Thank you, Lord,” said the little honey.\nAs they walked out he said, “And Lord, any time you want a favour you just come to me, ’cause I just dig you, man!”\nShocked and angry, the little Irishman watched them go, then rushed to the altar and prostrated himself, sobbing. “What have I done that you don’t hear my suffering and anguish? How come you don’t answer my prayers? I have been asking for months. I don’t ask much – he is a foreigner too, and the color of the devil himself! How come you give to him and not so much as answer me? Ah, Holy Mary, have pity and tell me what I’m doing so wrong!”\nSuddenly the church went dark, a deathly rush descended all around, a steely blue light appeared above the altar and a voice boomed out: (three finger-clicks) “I guess I just don’t dig you, man!!”\nPrayer has to be of the heart. It has to arise from your total being. It has to be true. Only then, and ONLY then, has something happened. God and you should not be on formal terms. You should dig Him – only then does He dig you.\nFormality has killed all religion. Be informal, be friendly, be relaxed with God. And the moment you are relaxed with God, therapy is finished; you have entered into the world of religion. Therapy is needed only because people have forgotten how to be religious. Therapy was not needed in the Buddha’s time; people naturally knew how to be religious. Therapy is a modern need – people have completely forgotten the ways of being religious. They are Christians, they are Hindus, they are Mohammedans, but not religious.\nIn my commune I have made it a must that everybody should pass through therapies, because unless you pass through therapies you will not be able to connect yourself with prayer. Therapies will help you to unburden the garbage that has been forced on you by the society. Therapies will help\nyou to cathart all the rubbish that you have repressed within yourself. Therapies will clean you. And only in a clean, clear heart is prayer possible. And when prayer arises, the miracle has happened. Prayer is the greatest miracle there is.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"9391","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_secret_of_secrets_vol_2/part8/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_secret_of_secrets_vol_2/>The Secret of Secrets, Vol 2</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">8 I sure dig you, man</h1><div class=post-meta>45 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;9391 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Secret_of_Secrets_Vol_2/part8.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part7>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

INTELLIGENCE OF THE HEART TO THE INTELLIGENCE OF THE MIND?</p><p><br></p><p>Punita, intelligence is the inborn capacity to see, to perceive.
Every child is born intelligent, then made stupid by the society. We
educate him in stupidity. Sooner or later he graduates in stupidity.</p><p><br></p><p>Intelligence is a natural phenomenon – just as breathing is, just as
seeing is. Intelligence is the inner seeing; it is intuitive. It has
nothing to do with intellect, remember. Never confuse intellect with
intelligence, they are polar opposites. Intellect is of the head; it is
taught by others, it is imposed on you. You have to cultivate it. It is
borrowed, it is something foreign, it is not inborn.</p><p><br></p><p>But intelligence is inborn. It is your very being, your very nature.
All animals are intelligent. They are not intellectuals, true, but they
are all intelligent. Trees are intelligent, the whole existence is
intelligent, and each child born is born intelligent. Have you ever come
across a child who is stupid? It is impossible! But to come across a
grown-up person who is intelligent is very rare; something goes wrong in
between.</p><p><br></p><p>I would like you to listen to this beautiful story. It may help. The
story is called ‘The Animal School’.</p><p><br></p><p>The animals got together in the forest one day and decided to start a
school. There was a rabbit, a bird, a squirrel, a fish and an eel, and
they formed a Board of Directors. The rabbit insisted that</p><p>running be in the curriculum. The bird insisted that flying be in the
curriculum. The fish insisted that swimming had to be in the curriculum,
and the squirrel said that perpendicular tree-climbing was absolutely
necessary to the curriculum. They put all of these things together and
wrote a curriculum guide. Then they insisted that ALL of the animals
take ALL of the subjects.</p><p><br></p><p>Although the rabbit was getting an A in running, perpendicular
tree-climbing was a real problem for him. He kept falling over
backwards. Pretty soon he got to be sort of brain-damaged and he could
not run anymore. He found that instead of making an A in running he was
making a C, and of course he always made an F in perpendicular climbing.
The bird was really beautiful at flying, but when it came to burrowing
in the ground he could not do so well. He kept breaking his beak and
wings. Pretty soon he was making a C in flying as well as an F in
burrowing, and he had a hell of a time with perpendicular
tree-climbing.</p><p><br></p><p>The moral of the story is that the person who was valedictorian of
the class was a mentally-retarded eel who did everything in a half-way
fashion. But the educators were all happy because everybody was taking
all of the subjects, and it was called a ‘broad-based education’.</p><p><br></p><p>We laugh at this, but that’s what it is. It is what you did. We
really are trying to make everybody the same as everybody else, hence
destroying everybody’s potential for being himself.</p><p><br></p><p>Intelligence dies in imitating others. If you want to remain
intelligent you will have to drop imitating. Intelligence commits
suicide in copying, in becoming a carbon copy. The moment you start
thinking how to be like that person you are falling from your
intelligence, you are becoming stupid. The moment you compare yourself
with somebody else you are losing your natural potential. Now you will
never be happy, and you will never be clean, clear, transparent. You
will lose your clarity, you will lose your vision. You will have
borrowed eyes; but how can you see through somebody else’s eyes? You
need your own eyes, you need your own legs to walk, your own heart to
beat.</p><p><br></p><p>People are living a borrowed life, hence their life is paralyzed.
This paralysis makes them look very stupid.</p><p><br></p><p>A totally new kind of education is needed in the world. The person
who is born to be a poet is proving himself stupid in mathematics and
the person who could have been a great mathematician is just cramming
history and feeling lost. Everything is topsy-turvy because education is
not according to your nature. It does not pay any respect to the
individual, it forces everybody into a certain pattern. Maybe by
accident the pattern fits a few people but the majority is lost and the
majority lives in misery.</p><p><br></p><p>The greatest misery in life is to feel oneself stupid, unworthy,
unintelligent. And nobody is born unintelligent; nobody can be born
unintelligent because we come from God. God is pure intelligence. We
bring some flavor, some fragrance from God when we come into the world.
But immediately the society jumps upon you, starts manipulating,
teaching, changing, cutting, adding, and soon you have lost all shape,
all form. The society wants you to be obedient, conformist, orthodox.
This is how your intelligence is destroyed.</p><p><br></p><p>My whole approach is to take you out of this imposed pattern. This is
a prison cell in which you are living. You can drop it. It will be
difficult to drop because you have become so accustomed to it. It</p><p>will be difficult to drop because it is not just like clothing; it
has become almost your skin, you have lived with it so long. It will be
difficult to drop because this is your whole identity – but it has to be
dropped if you really want to claim your real being.</p><p><br></p><p>If you really want to be intelligent you have to be a rebel. Only the
rebellious person is intelligent. What do I mean by rebellion? – I mean
dropping all that has been enforced on you against your will. Search
again for who you are, start from ABC again. Think that your time, up to
now, has been a wastage because you have been following.</p><p><br></p><p>No person is similar to anybody else, each is unique – that is the
nature of intelligence – and each is incomparable. Don’t compare
yourself to anybody. How can you compare? You are you and the other is
other. You are not similar, so comparison is not possible.</p><p><br></p><p>But we have been taught to compare and we are continuously comparing.
Directly, indirectly, consciously, unconsciously, we live in comparison.
And if you compare you will never respect yourself: somebody is more
beautiful than you, somebody is taller than you, somebody is healthier
than you, and somebody is something else; somebody has such a musical
voice... and you will be burdened and burdened if you go on comparing.
Millions of people are there; you will be crushed by your
comparisons.</p><p><br></p><p>And you had a beautiful soul, a beautiful being which wanted to
bloom, which wanted to become a Golden Flower, but you never allowed it.
Be unburdened. Put all aside. Regain, reclaim your innocence, your
childhood. Jesus is right when he says, “Unless you are born again, you
shall not enter into my kingdom of God.”</p><p><br></p><p>I say the same to you: Unless you are born AGAIN.…</p><p><br></p><p>Let your sannyas be a new birth! Drop all the garbage that has been
put on you! Be fresh! Start from the very beginning, and you will be
surprised – how much intelligence is immediately released.</p><p><br></p><p>Punita, you ask, “What exactly is intelligence?”</p><p><br></p><p>It is capacity to see, capacity to understand, capacity to live your
own life according to your own nature. That is what intelligence is.</p><p><br></p><p>And what is stupidity? Following others, imitating others, obeying
others, looking through their eyes, trying to imbibe their knowledge as
your knowledge: that is stupidity.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why pundits are almost always stupid people. They are parrots,
they repeat. They are gramophone records. They can repeat skillfully,
but let a new situation arise, that which is not written in their books,
and they are at a loss. They don’t have any intelligence.</p><p><br></p><p>Intelligence is the capacity to respond moment-to-moment to life as
it happens, not according to a program. Only unintelligent people have a
program. They are afraid; they know that they don’t have enough
intelligence to encounter life as it is. They have to be ready, they
rehearse. They prepare the answer before the question has been raised,
and that’s how they prove themselves stupid – because the question is
never the same. The question is always new. Each day brings its own
problems, its</p><p>own challenges and each moment brings its own questions. And if you
have ready-made answers in your head you will not be able even to listen
to the question. You will be so full of your answer, you will be
incapable of listening. You will not be available. And whatsoever you
will do you will do according to your ready-made answer – which is
irrelevant, which has no relationship with the reality as it is.</p><p><br></p><p>Intelligence is: to relate with reality, unprepared. And the beauty
of facing life unprepared is tremendous. Then life has a newness, a
youth; then life has a flow and freshness. Then life has so many
surprises. And when life has so many surprises boredom never settles in
you.</p><p><br></p><p>The stupid person is always bored. He is bored because of the answers
that he has gathered from others and goes on repeating. He is bored
because his eyes are so full of knowledge, he cannot see what is
happening. He knows too much without knowing at all. He is not wise, he
is only knowledgeable. When he looks at a roseflower, he does not look
at THIS roseflower. All the roseflowers that he has read about, all the
roseflowers that the poets have talked about, all the roseflowers that
painters have painted and philosophers have discussed, and all the
roseflowers that he had heard about, they are standing in his eyes – a
great queue of memories, information. THIS roseflower that is there is
lost in that queue, in that crowd. He cannot see it. He simply repeats;
he says, “This roseflower is beautiful.” Those words are also not his
own, not authentic, not sincere, not true. Somebody else’s voice... he
is just playing a tape.</p><p><br></p><p>Stupidity is repetition, repeating others. It is cheap, cheap because
you need not learn. Learning is arduous. It needs guts to learn.
Learning means one has to be humble. Learning means one has to be ready
to drop the old, one has to be constantly ready to accept the new.
Learning means a non-egoistic state.</p><p><br></p><p>And one never knows where learning will lead you. One cannot predict
about the learner; his life will remain unpredictable. He himself cannot
predict what is going to happen tomorrow, where he will be tomorrow. He
moves in a state of no-knowledge. Only when you live in a state of
no-knowledge, a CONSTANT state of no-knowledge, do you learn.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why children learn beautifully. As they grow old they stop
learning, because knowledge gathers and it is cheap to repeat it. Why
bother? It is cheap, simple, to follow the pattern, to move in a circle.
But then boredom settles. Stupidity and boredom go together.</p><p><br></p><p>The intelligent person is as fresh as dewdrops in the morning sun, as
fresh as the stars in the night. You can feel his newness, so new, like
a breeze.</p><p><br></p><p>Intelligence is the capacity to be reborn again and again. To die to
the past is intelligence, and to live in the present is
intelligence.</p><p><br></p><p>And, Punita, you also ask, “What is the relationship of intelligence
of the heart to the intelligence of the mind?”</p><p><br></p><p>They are diametrically opposite. The intelligence of the head is not
intelligence at all; it is knowledgeability. The intelligence of the
heart is the intelligence, the only intelligence there is. The head is
simply an accumulator. It is always old, it is never new, it is never
original. It is good for</p><p>certain purposes: for filing it is perfectly good. And in life one
needs this – many things have to be remembered. The mind, the head, is a
biocomputer. You can go on accumulating knowledge in it and whenever you
need you can take it out. It is good for mathematics, good for
calculation, good for the day-to-day life, the marketplace; but if you
think this is your whole life then you will remain stupid. You will
never know the beauty of feeling and you will never know the blessing of
the heart. And you will never know the grace that descends only through
the heart, the God that enters only through the heart. You will never
know prayer, you will never know poetry, you will never know love.</p><p><br></p><p>The intelligence of the heart creates poetry in your life, gives
dance to your steps, makes your life a joy, a celebration, a festivity,
a laughter. It gives you a sense of humor. It makes you capable of love,
of sharing. That is true life. The life that is lived from the head is a
mechanical life. You become a robot – maybe very efficient; robots are
very efficient, machines are more efficient than man. You can earn much
through the head, but you will not live much. You may have a better
standard of living but you won’t have any life.</p><p><br></p><p>Life is of the heart. Life can only grow through the heart. It is the
soil of the heart where love grows, life grows, God grows. All that is
beautiful, all that is really valuable, all that is meaningful,
significant, comes through the heart. The heart is your very center, the
head is just your periphery. To live in the head is to live on the
circumference without ever becoming aware of the beauties and the
treasures of the center. To live on the periphery is stupidity. You ask,
“What is stupidity?”</p><p><br></p><p>To live in the head is stupidity. To live in the heart and USE the
head whenever needed is intelligence. But the center, the Master, is at
the very core of your being. The Master is the heart, and the head is
just a servant: this is intelligence. When the head becomes the Master
and forgets all about the heart, that is stupidity.</p><p><br></p><p>It is up to you to choose. Remember, the head as a slave is a
beautiful slave, of much utility, but as a master is a dangerous master
and will destroy your whole life, will poison your whole life. Look
around! People’s lives are absolutely poisoned, poisoned by the head.
They cannot feel, they are no more sensitive, nothing thrills them. The
sun rises but nothing rises in them; they look at the sun empty-eyed.
The sky becomes full of the stars – the marvel, the mystery! – but
nothing stirs in their hearts, no song arises. Birds sing, man has
forgotten to sing. Clouds come in the sky and the peacocks dance, and
man does not know how to dance. He has become a cripple. Trees bloom.…
Man thinks, never feels, and without feeling there is no flowering
possible.</p><p><br></p><p>The Golden Flower that we have been talking about this whole month is
there in you, waiting – waiting for centuries, for lives. When are you
going to give attention to it so that it can bloom? And unless a man
becomes a Golden Flower what the yogis have called the
‘one-thousand-petalled lotus’, sahasrar – unless your life becomes an
opening, one thousand petals open and the fragrance is released, you
will have lived in vain, “a tale told by an idiot, full of fury and
noise, signifying nothing”.</p><p><br></p><p>Watch, scrutinize, observe, have another look at your life. Nobody
else is going to help you. You have depended on others so long; that’s
why you have become stupid. Now, take care; it is your own
responsibility. You OWE it to yourself to have a deep penetrating look
at what you are doing with your life. Is there any poetry in your heart?
If it is not there, then don’t waste time. Help your heart to weave and
spin poetry. Is there any romance in your life or not? If there is not,
then you are dead, then you are already in your grave.</p><p>Come OUT of it! Let life have something of the romantic in it,
something like adventure. Explore! Millions of beauties and splendors
are waiting for you. You go on moving around and around, never entering
into the temple of life. The door is the heart.</p><p><br></p><p>So I say: the real intelligence is of the heart. It is not
intellectual, it is emotional. It is not like thinking, it is like
feeling. It is not logic, it is love.</p><p><br></p><p>The second question:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2</p><p><br></p><p>WHAT IS IT IN THE MAKE-UP OF SOMEONE LIKE EVA RENZI THAT MAKES HER
TELL SUCH OUTRAGEOUS LIES ABOUT A COMMUNITY LIKE OURS?</p><p><br></p><p>I feel sorry for Eva Renzi. She was really in great need. She has
missed an opportunity. She must be suffering from a split personality.
She is not one, she is two. She is schizophrenic. That’s why she had
come in search, to find some clarity, some integration.</p><p><br></p><p>She has been in psychotherapy, she has been psychoanalyzed, but the
psychoanalysis has not been of much help. That’s why her husband
suggested that she come here. The husband also has not been able to live
with her, they are separated.</p><p><br></p><p>And just the other day I was reading a statement by one of the
directors – she is a film actress – and the director remembers that ten
or twelve years ago he was directing a film and she was the heroine in
the film. They had booked a beautiful castle somewhere in Germany for
only one day. And the whole crew waited and all the actors waited, and
Eva Renzi never turned up! Almost in tears, everybody left. And in the
evening she turned up, laughing, smiling. And the director says he
became so crazy that he hit her with a chair! And then he felt bad too.
He had a heart attack; for three, four months he had to rest. He says
that anybody who can live for one hour with Eva Renzi will hit her!</p><p><br></p><p>Now the poor woman must have been in deep suffering. She is crazy!
She would have been immensely helped if she had been a little patient,
if she had been here a little longer.</p><p><br></p><p>But these patterns go very deep. These patterns go so deep that it is
almost impossible to help such people.</p><p><br></p><p>She was in one group, Centering; she created trouble there – and she
was creating so much trouble that the whole group was disturbed. And you
cannot allow one hundred and twenty-five people to be disturbed for one
person. So Prasad, the group leader, had to tell her that if she was so
angry, in a rage, so much in violence, that it would be better that she
should participate in the Encounter group where she could release her
anger, her rage, cathart, but the Centering group was not for her.</p><p><br></p><p>She immediately left and entered into the Encounter group, and within
hours she was gone – because there also she created much trouble,
provoked everybody to fight. The Encounter group is meant for release,
and when people started fighting with her she left the group.</p><p>Now the other personality must have taken possession of her. She did
not report to the police here in Poona. If there had been something
wrong with her she should have gone to the police. She went to police in
Bombay and reported that she had been beaten – so much so that the room
was full of blood – her clothes had been torn apart and she had to go
out of the ashram naked to the hotel! Now, do you think a beautiful
woman like Eva Renzi walking naked on the Poona streets would have
survived? Nobody remembers a naked woman in the ‘Blue Diamond’, bleeding
and going there; nobody had seen her. There are thousands of people here
the whole day: nobody had seen her going and leaving, naked, bleeding,
shouting, crying; nobody had seen her. She reported to the police in
Bombay, not here. And the police came and searched and found the whole
thing was a lie.</p><p><br></p><p>But I don’t think that she is lying; it is her other personality, her
other self. The other person had taken possession of her, not that she
was lying knowingly. When the other person takes possession, it becomes
impossible – you don’t know what you are saying, why you are saying
it.</p><p><br></p><p>The people who are split function almost like two persons. When they
are in one personality they are one person, when they are in another
personality they are a different person, and both personalities never
meet.</p><p><br></p><p>Now she has created much fuss in Germany, in the newspapers, but I
feel real compassion for her. I invite her again. I have not seen her.
All this just happened within a day, I have not seen her. I would like
to see her and help her; she needs help. And she has gone so deeply into
this schizophrenia that I don’t think she can be helped anywhere else.
If she comes back it will be good: those two personalities can be welded
again. But it will need patience. If she had come with her husband or
some friends it would have been better. They would have prevented her
from escaping so soon.</p><p><br></p><p>A little time will be needed. A lifelong pattern can’t be changed in
one day. And the schizophrenics have their own ideas about things. They
are so full of their own madness that they think everybody else is mad.
Their projections are such, they feel that they are being persecuted,
everybody is going to murder them or kill them.</p><p><br></p><p>Once it happened :I had to live in the same room with a professor for
a few months. He was a schizophrenic. When he was good he was utterly
good, a really nice fellow, but when he was bad he was really bad. And
it was very difficult to know when he was going to be good, when he was
going to be bad. In the middle of the night he would start shouting or
would start provoking me to fight with him. If you didn’t fight, you
didn’t honor him. If you didn’t start fighting, then he would be angry.
If you fought him you unnecessarily got into trouble with him. And then
the neighbors would come, and he would shout and he would make such
fuss. And by the morning he would have forgotten everything! If you
reminded him he would say, “No, you must have dreamt it.” If you called
the neighbors he would say, “They must have been dreaming, because I
have slept so well the whole night.” It was so difficult. I would go to
the university to teach; when I would come home all my things would be
gone!</p><p><br></p><p>He had two personalities. The other personality was really something!
He would store everything in his suitcases and lock them. When he was
good he would be very generous, he would give his things to me. I
enjoyed living with him for a few months because it was such a surprise
– you never knew what was going to happen today. And when he was in his
bad personality, in the neurotic, he was so afraid, that anything... and
he would think the murderer was coming or the police were coming to
catch hold of him. And he would imagine: just a jeep passing by in the
middle of the night</p><p>– he would wake me up. He would say, “Look, the police are reaching,
the jeep has come. Now I will be caught. And I tell you that I am
innocent! And I have not done anything wrong – you are my witness!” Just
the whistle of the police in the night and he would be alerted.</p><p><br></p><p>These people are in deep suffering. They have their own ideas, and
they are so clouded in their ideas that they don’t see the reality.</p><p><br></p><p>Now I don’t think she is aware at all of what she is saying, of what
she is reporting to the newspapers. She says one man, an old man, a
Dutchman – he is none other than the famous author, Amrito – tried to
rape her. Now he will be the last man to think of rape; she is just like
a daughter to him. And such a nice, loving person. But somehow she had
got the idea that there was an old Dutchman in the Encounter group who
wanted to rape her. Now she is going around telling people, the
newspapers. But the idea had got into her, and newspapers are always
ready to exploit anything.</p><p><br></p><p>A man came home to find his wife having a nervous breakdown,
screaming and banging her head on the wall.</p><p><br></p><p>“What is the matter, darling?” said the worried husband. “I am
homesick!” sobbed the distraught woman.</p><p>“But you are at home, darling,” said the husband. “Exactly!” said the
wife, “I am sick of home!”</p><p>When you have your ideas, your own interpretations, things start
appearing like that. And you can always find explanations, excuses; you
can always find arguments. And remember, neurotic people are very
argumentative because they are hung-up in the head.</p><p><br></p><p>So don’t feel angry with Eva Renzi, not at all. And don’t be worried
about what is happening in Germany. It is going to help my work
tremendously! I know my business and how to do it; don’t be worried
about it.</p><p><br></p><p>Now it is all over Germany. EVERYBODY knows my name – this is
something great – and everybody is asking about me, “Who is this man?”
Sannyasins who have come from Germany just a few days ago report that
even taxi-drivers ask, “Are you going to Poona? I am also thinking of
going! What is happening there?”</p><p><br></p><p>Now many people will be coming because of Eva Renzi. And remember,
there is always a balance, otherwise life would collapse. Her negative
statements started creating positive statements. That’s how it always
happens. That’s what I mean when I say I know my business. Now this
director has come to defend me. He does not know me, but he says that if
it has happened to Eva Renzi it is perfectly good; she needed it, she
deserved it! He says all the people who knew her will be happy –
particularly her husband. Now more and more positive statements will be
coming.</p><p><br></p><p>Just create the negative and the positive starts coming. Create the
positive and the negative starts coming. They always balance, otherwise
life would collapse. So never be worried about negative things; it is
always like that.</p><p>Do you know who created Christianity? – not Christ, but the people
who crucified him. If they had not crucified him there would have been
no Christianity, you would never have even heard of Jesus. It is the
people who crucified him. Now crucifixion is such a negativity that the
positive is bound to happen. Now somebody is bound to start worshipping;
then the balance. Life always balances.</p><p><br></p><p>So the poor woman is in suffering but it is good for my work. Nothing
is wrong in it. Those lies that she is telling will be refuted from many
unknown quarters. People will come up on their own, and many people will
come just out of curiosity. Many more lies will follow, and many more
truths to balance them. Now, because she started the thing, many
newspapers have come to Poona. Since she started the ball rolling, many
newspapers, many journalists have come. A few have written against, a
few have written for.</p><p><br></p><p>One journalist seems to be really very inventive. He writes that he
reached to the ashram-gate door at five thirty, early in the morning. He
knocked on the door. A great beauty, a blonde, opened the door – at five
thirty! – and welcomed him with an apple, or something like an apple. He
said, “I don’t know what fruit it was. She gave the fruit to me and she
said, ‘You are welcome in the Garden of the Master. Come in!’ And I
asked, ‘What is this apple?’ and she said, ‘You eat it. It will give you
sexual energy.”’</p><p><br></p><p>Now the taxi-drivers are asking, “Are there such types of fruits in
the garden? We would like to come.” Who would not like to come! Let
these people work. They are helping my work; nothing to be worried
about. I always rejoice!</p><p><br></p><p>The third question:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 3</p><p><br></p><p>WHAT IS YOUR MESSAGE, OSHO? I DON’T UNDERSTAND YOU.</p><p><br></p><p>My message is that there is no message. I am not here to give you a
message, because a message will become knowledge. I am here to impart
something of my being. It is not a message, it is a gift. It is not a
theory, it is not a philosophy. I want you to partake of my being. It
cannot be reduced into a dogma. You cannot go back and tell people what
you have learned here; you will not be able to. If you have learned
anything you will not be able to relate it to anybody, although your
whole being will show it. You will not be able to say it but only to
show it. Your eyes will show it, your face will beam, your whole energy
will have a different vibe.</p><p><br></p><p>I am not functioning here as a teacher. This is not a school. I don’t
teach you a thing. I simply want you to participate with me, in this
mystery that has happened to me. Fall in tune with my energy, vibrate
with me, pulsate with me – and you will know something which is beyond
words, which no message can contain.</p><p><br></p><p>Once the great Master Joshu was asked for his word. Joshu said,
“There is not even half a word.” When he was asked further, “Master, but
are you not here?” he said, “I am not a word.”</p><p>He is right. A Master is not a word, a Master is a door. A Master is
not a message but a medium. A Master is a link, a bridge. Pass through
the door, pass through the bridge, and you will come to</p><p>know exactly what life is all about. If you can dive deep into the
Master you will start feeling the presence of God – but it is not a
message.</p><p><br></p><p>And you say you don’t understand me. I know why you can’t understand
me: because whatsoever I am saying is so simple, that is why. Had it
been complex you would have understood it. You are accustomed to
complexity: the more complex a thing is, the more your intellect starts
working on it. The challenge to the ego...</p><p><br></p><p>My communion with you is so simple, so utterly simple that there is
no challenge for the ego; that is the reason why you can’t understand
me. What I say is simple and absolutely clear. I don’t use any jargon. I
am simply using the language that you use in your day-to-day work, in
your day-to-day life. Maybe that is the reason for your not
understanding me. The obvious is what I say and teach – yes, the obvious
– but the obvious sounds bizarre because you have become so accustomed
to the complexities that the mad mind goes on spinning and weaving
around you.</p><p><br></p><p>And moreover, always keep in mind that what I say is said for no
particular reason. There is no motive behind it. Just as they say ‘art
for art’s sake’, what I am saying to you has no particular reason behind
it, no motive, but a sheer joy of being together with you, a sheer
response to your questions. Not that my answers will solve your
questions; no, not at all. If my answers can solve your questions, then
it becomes a message. My answers will only help you to understand your
questions – and when a question is understood, it dissolves. No question
is ever solved. If you understand a question rightly it dissolves, it is
not solved. It becomes insignificant, trivial and false, like a dry leaf
from the tree. It loses all meaning. I am not going to give you answers,
I am going to take away your questions.</p><p><br></p><p>And when the mind has no question to ask, in that utter silence where
no question is present, you come to know that which is – call it God,
call it Tao, truth, NIRVANA, or what you will.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why I say there is no particular reason in my saying
whatsoever I say to you. There is no particular motive behind it, it is
a simple response to your being. I am only being a mirror, hence there
is no particular need to understand me. Don’t try to understand me.
There is nothing to understand. Just be with me and understanding will
come on its own. And these are two different types of
understandings.</p><p><br></p><p>When you try to understand me you will miss, because while I am
imparting something to you, you are engaged and occupied in
understanding it. You will miss it. Don’t try to understand it, just
listen! Just as I am talking to you without any motive, listen on your
part without any motive – and the meeting is bound to happen. When I am
without motive and you are without motive, what can hinder, what can
obstruct the meeting? Then the meeting is going to happen. And in that
communion is understanding; in that communion is light, clarity,
transparency.</p><p><br></p><p>So rather than trying to understand me, celebrate me, rejoice in me –
and you will understand, and without any effort to understand.</p><p><br></p><p>Nobody ever understands through effort. What effort do you make when
you listen to music? Do you try to understand it? If you try to
understand it, you will miss the whole joy of it. The music has to be
rejoiced in. Do you try to understand a dance? Then you will miss it.
The dance has to be</p><p>celebrated. Do you try to understand the roseflowers and the songs of
the birds in the morning? There is no need! Just be with the roseflower,
just see the bird on the wing. Don’t let anything hinder, and suddenly,
understanding arises. That understanding arises from the heart, from
your intelligence. It is not of the head.</p><p><br></p><p>And then the understanding has a totally different flavor, a totally
different fragrance to it. Then it has beauty – because it comes out of
effortlessness, it comes out of love. If you try to understand me, logic
will be there, mind will be there. If you don’t try to understand me, if
you just listen for the sake of listening, then slowly, slowly something
starts opening in you, arising in you, awakening in you.</p><p><br></p><p>Let me be a provocation, not a message. Let me be an alarm to wake
you up, not a message. If you think in terms of a message you will
create a wall between me and you. Just be here. Just as I am with you,
you be with me – for no particular reason, just for the sheer joy of
this silence, this presence that surrounds me and you, that joins me and
you, this meditativeness, this grace, this moment of sheer beauty and
benediction.</p><p><br></p><p>And your heart will understand. Whether your mind understands or not
is of no significance. The fifth question:</p><p>Question 4</p><p><br></p><p>MORARJI DESAI SAYS THAT STUDENTS SHOULD NOT TAKE PART IN POLITICS.
WHAT DO YOU SAY ABOUT IT?</p><p><br></p><p>Remember always: whatsoever the politicians say, it is always
politics. Whenever a politician reaches to power he always starts
telling the students not to participate in politics – but only when he
is in power. When he is not in power he is all in favor – students
SHOULD participate in politics.</p><p><br></p><p>How has Morarji reached to power? Basically, it was a students’
movement in Gujarat and Bihar; on that tidal wave of the youth movement
he has reached to power. Now he must be afraid; now if students continue
to participate in politics he can be toppled.</p><p><br></p><p>This is something beautiful to be understood: whenever politicians
are out of power they provoke the students. The same politicians, when
they reach to power, they start telling the students, “Please, this is
not your work. You should go to the colleges, to the universities.
Politics has to be avoided. Don’t be distracted by politics!” Because
that is the bridge, that bridge has to be broken. Otherwise others will
be coming. And students cannot be befooled so easily as others can be
befooled. Youth cannot be befooled as easily as others can be befooled
because youth is still not involved in the vested interests of the
society. The older you grow the more your investment is in the status
quo; you cannot go against it. You are married, you have children, you
have a job, you have to look after the family, and there are a thousand
and one responsibilities on you. You would like everything to remain as
it is, you will be afraid of any change. Who knows? – your job is lost,
and what is going to happen to your children?</p><p><br></p><p>Students prove to be the most revolutionary part of the society for
the simple reason that they have no investment; for the simple reason
that they can ask for, demand, change. And of course they are</p><p>young; their eyes can still see a little bit. They can still feel.
And of course they are going to live in the future. The past is not
their world, but the future. The older you grow the less future you have
and the more past. A man of seventy has very little future and a very
long past. And the man who is only twenty has very little past and a
long future; his orientation is the future. And whenever the future is
the orientation there is rebellion, revolution.</p><p><br></p><p>And the people who are in power are always afraid of any kind of
rebellion, of any kind of revolution.</p><p><br></p><p>So remember, when politicians say, “Participate in politics,” then
too it is politics. When they say, “Don’t participate in politics,” then
too it is politics. They always speak politics, whatsoever they say.
Even in their sleep, if they start saying something, it is politics –
don’t believe them! Even in their dreams they remain politicians.</p><p><br></p><p>But they are cunning people, shrewd people: whenever there is a
revolution, whenever there is some change, some movement, and the youth
is stirred, the shrewd politicians simply ride on the wave.</p><p><br></p><p>Now this revolution that happened just one and a half years ago was
created by the youth, and the power went into the hands of the very
rotten old. This is strange – that the stir was of the youth but the
people who came into power are all above seventy, and a few are even
above eighty. One sometimes wonders why dead people can’t get out of
their graves and become prime ministers and presidents... they will
prove to be even better!</p><p><br></p><p>I was reading a story:</p><p><br></p><p>Three old friends met for lunch one day. Well advanced in years, they
met periodically to keep up to date on each other. The youngest of the
three told his news first. His wife had just given him a baby girl – and
he was almost seventy-nine years old!</p><p><br></p><p>The second man spoke. He was eighty-three years of age and his wife
had just had a son. The two fathers were proud as peacocks.</p><p><br></p><p>Then the third man offered some food for thought. “My friends,” he
said, “let me tell you a story. I am eighty-eight. Used to hunt a lot,
but I am too old for that nonsense now. But last week I was strolling in
the park and a cottontail came bounding out of the bushes. True to an
old instinct, I raised my walking cane to shooting position, cried,
‘Bang! Bang!’ and the rabbit rolled over dead!</p><p><br></p><p>“A few minutes later I spied another cottontail. Again I simulated a
rifle with my cane and cried ‘Bang!’ Again the rabbit dropped dead!</p><p><br></p><p>“What necromancy, what strange spell is this? I wondered aloud. Then,
gentlemen, I glanced behind – ten paces to the rear was a young boy
shooting with a real rifle!”</p><p><br></p><p>Morarji Desai should ponder over it: your ‘bang! bang!’ has not done
anything; just the youth of the country have been shooting behind
you.</p><p>But now, naturally, once you have reached to power you become afraid.
But you ask me, “What do you say about it?”</p><p>I also say to you to avoid politics, don’t take part in politics –
not for the same reason, of course. First, I am not a politician.
Second, I am not in power. I have nothing to be afraid of in your taking
part in politics. So, the reason why Morarji Desai says, “Don’t
participate in politics,” is something else. The reason why I say to
you, “Don’t participate in politics,” is totally different. The reason
is: leave politics for the stupid people, the utterly stupid who cannot
do anything else. First try to be a scientist, a poet, a painter, an
architect, a musician, a novelist, a potter, a weaver, a carpenter –
something intelligent, something creative. If you find that you cannot
create anything; when you have looked around and tried everywhere, and
everywhere you get ‘F’, then go into politics – that is the last resort
of the stupid and the scoundrels – never before. First try; there are
beautiful experiences in life. Politics is destructive. It is the most
ugly phenomenon. Leave it to others who cannot do anything else. And
remember, if you don’t leave it to others who cannot do anything else,
those others will become criminals.</p><p><br></p><p>The criminal and the politician are the same type of people. If the
criminal becomes politically successful he is a great leader. If the
politician cannot succeed in being in power he becomes a criminal. They
are destructive people: their whole effort is to dominate others.</p><p><br></p><p>The really creative person is not interested in dominating anybody.
He is so utterly rejoicing in life – he wants to create, he wants to
participate with God. Creativity is prayer. And whenever you create
something, in those moments you are with God, you walk with God, you
live in God. The more creative you are the more divine you are. To me,
creativity is religion. Art is just the entrance to the temple of
religion.</p><p><br></p><p>Create something! When you fail everywhere, then politics. It is not
for the intelligent people, it is for the utterly unintelligent and
stupid. And of course, they also need somewhere, some place to do some
nonsense of their own. They need parliaments to quarrel in and go mad.
Leave it to them!</p><p><br></p><p>I also say to students: Don’t participate in politics unless you have
failed everywhere else. First try other dimensions of life, far richer.
But my reason is totally different.</p><p><br></p><p>And if you become interested in politics too early you will remain
retarded for your whole life. When are you going to read Kalidas and
Shakespeare and Milton and Tennyson and Eliot and Pound? When are you
going to see the great painters, learn their art? When are you going to
meditate in Khajuraho, Konarak? When are you going to dream great dreams
of creating a Taj Mahal or a painting or poetry? When? There is great
literature, great painting, great poetry. Watch your steps.</p><p><br></p><p>Politics seems to be attractive for only one single reason, and that
has to be understood.</p><p><br></p><p>The English word ‘self-consciousness’ has to be understood; that will
help you. It has two meanings. One is the meaning which Buddha preaches
and Gurdjieff preaches and I preach: it means to become conscious of
yourself, become alert. Gurdjieff used the word ‘self-remembering’, and
Buddha uses the words SAMA SMRATI, mindfulness, consciousness.
Krishnamurti uses the word ‘awareness’ – become fully alert and aware.
This is the one meaning of the word ‘self-conscious’. The word is very
ambiguous.</p><p><br></p><p>The other meaning is when you stand on a stage and you become
self-conscious, and you start trembling. The other meaning is
pathological. The first meaning means you are conscious of</p><p>yourself – you are not a robot, you function out of awareness. The
second means that you are aware that OTHERS are conscious of you, that
others are watching you, that you are an object of others’ consciousness
– and you become afraid. So many people watching... if something goes
wrong... and they will laugh and they will think you are a fool or
ridiculous – and you become afraid. Others are watching you; you are an
object. You become conscious of this phenomenon – conscious that others
are conscious of you – then fear arises. But joy too arises – “So many
people watching me” – so you repress your fear. You stand there on the
stage without trembling: “So many people watching me...” The fear is: if
something goes wrong they will think you are a fool. The joy is: “If
nothing goes wrong, and I can perform well, then so many people will
think, ‘Look! What a great man! What a great artist, actor, speaker,
orator!’ If I can succeed in performing something, so many people will
look towards me, upwards at me, and will enhance my ego.”</p><p>The politician lives in this. He wants many people to look up to him
so his ego is enhanced. He is afraid of going within because he knows
there is nothing, emptiness. He does not know who he is. He collects his
information about himself from others’ eyes, from what they say. If they
say “You are a great man” he believes he is a great man. He rides on the
winds. If they say “You are a mahatma” he feels greatly happy, his ego
is fulfilled. He is attaining a kind of identity – now he knows who he
is. But this is not true self-knowledge; others can take it away any
moment. And they always take, because sooner or later they can see that
you have not fulfilled your promises, that your performance has been
bogus.</p><p><br></p><p>You can see Morarji Desai’s great ego eroding by and by. You can see
the same with Jimmy Carter – the smile becoming smaller and smaller,
disappearing – because you cannot fulfill the promises that you have
made to the people. And you always make big promises. Without making big
promises you will not reach to power, so you give fantastic promises
that you know you cannot fulfill – but who cares! Once you are in power,
then we will see. Then we will see how they can take you out of power;
you will cling, and you will have all the powers to cling and the whole
bureaucracy and the whole government machinery will be with you. Once
you are in power who cares about the promises? The leaders forget all
about their promises. And don’t remind them! They feel very hurt and
very annoyed.</p><p>But people start seeing that the promises are not being fulfilled:
“These people have cheated us!” The image starts falling, the person
becomes smaller. That hurts.</p><p><br></p><p>The politician is continuously in search of enhancing his ego. He
needs others’ attention. Millions of people have to feed his ego. The
artist, the mystic, the musician, the dancer – if they are also asking
for others’ attention, then they are politicians. Then they are not real
artists, not real mystics.</p><p><br></p><p>The real mystic, the real artist, is one who knows the other meaning
of self-consciousness: he is simply conscious of himself. He does not
need anybody else’s attention, he is enough unto himself. He can be
silently sitting and enjoying himself; he does not need anybody. His
life is of awareness, he moves with awareness, his each step is full of
light. Hence he never repents, he never feels guilty. Whatsoever he
does, he does with full awareness. All that he can do he does, and
whatsoever happens he accepts – because that is the only thing that
could have happened. He never looks back. He moves ahead and he lives in
the present, but he lives in a very conscious way.</p><p><br></p><p>Self-consciousness in the meaning Buddha gives the word makes you a
creator, and self- consciousness the way a politician needs it makes you
just an egoist.</p><p>I say to you: Don’t participate in politics because that is search
ing for the ego. And to search for the ego is to search for something
poisonous that will destroy your whole life. The politician is the
poorest man in the world, the most empty man, the most hollow, stuffed
with straw and nothing else.</p><p><br></p><p>The last question:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 5</p><p><br></p><p>WHEN CAN A THERAPY BE CALLED ‘FINISHED’?</p><p><br></p><p>Therapy is the need of the divided person. Therapy is the need of the
person who has fallen into fragments. Therapy is complete when you have
become a whole, when you are one piece.</p><p><br></p><p>But no therapy, as it is known in the modern world, brings you to
wholeness. Therapy is, at the most, nothing but a rearrangement – maybe
a little better than before, but you remain fragmentary. It is the same
furniture rearranged in the same room – maybe a little bit more
conveniently – but it doesn’t make you whole, because when a person
becomes whole his life becomes prayer.</p><p><br></p><p>Prayer is the by-product of wholeness. Wholeness makes you holy.
Unless your therapy brings prayer to your heart it is not complete yet.
The basic need is that of prayer.</p><p><br></p><p>Jung is reported to have said – and his observation is absolutely
right – that one half of his patients were in need not of therapy but of
religion. He is also reported to have said – and again he is right –
that all the patients that went to him who were above forty-two didn’t
need therapy, but needed prayer.</p><p><br></p><p>The real need is to have a context in this infinite existence. The
ego makes you separate; prayer dissolves the ego and you become one with
existence again. To become one with existence is to attain to bliss. To
remain separate, there is conflict. To remain separate means you are
fighting with existence, you are not flowing with the river. You may
even be trying to go upstream – and going upstream you are going to be
frustrated, you are going to fail. Flowing with the river – so much so
that you become one with the river, just a part of the river, you don’t
have any will of your own, you are surrendered to the will of the total
– this is prayer. And a therapy is complete, finished, when prayer is
born in your heart.</p><p><br></p><p>But the prayer has to be true. It should not be a formality, it
should not be a repetition, parrotlike. It should arise, it should have
roots in your being.</p><p><br></p><p>Anutosh has sent me a beautiful joke. Meditate over it.</p><p><br></p><p>Every day for six months the kneeling figure, hands clasped in
prayer, had intoned the same pitiful story in the shadow of the back
pews in his local Catholic church.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh Lord, sure I am only a poor simple fellow. Not even the price of
a glass of wine do I have for after mass on Sunday, and I know I am a
terribly wicked fellow. I give the missus a clout now and then, and when
the kids get too much I have to rebuke them with the back of my
hand.</p><p>“But I am not asking for much, just a couple of quid in the old wage
packet – not for myself, mind, just for the housekeeping to keep the old
lady off my back and some sweets for the kids. Maybe the odd drink for
me. I would not abuse it though, Lord. Can you help me? It would make an
awful lot of difference, and I will ask for nothing more, to be sure.
God bless, Hail Mary, Amen!”</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly the door of the church burst open and a smartly dressed West
Indian swaggered down the aisle and took a defiant stance in front of
the altar, and raising his fist shouted, “Hey dere, Lord. Now you listen
here! I dun just got to dis country. I dun got nuttin, and dey ain’t
about to give me no credit, so I dun come to you. I needs a li’l
sugar-mama first. I dun need furs and jewels to dress her in, I needs a
big car to drive her in, and I needs money to spend. So I want a big win
on de horses and den a good investment, and I needs it double quick. So
quit messing around and just get at it. I know you’se can do it Lord, I
just knows<span class=s4></span>”.</p><p><br></p><p>Turning and striding out, he added, “I sure dig you man, I sure dig
you.”</p><p><br></p><p>Some weeks later the kneeling Catholic is still there, mumbling into
his hands, when suddenly the doors burst open and the same West Indian,
arms around a gorgeous girl, bops straight down to the altar and
grinning from ear to ear, laughs, “I knews you could do it, Lord! I done
got a Rolls Royce. I owns de racecourse now. Talk about winning hard, I
got my pants full of money here. Say ‘thank you’ to the Lord, honey.”
“Thank you, Lord,” said the little honey.</p><p><br></p><p>As they walked out he said, “And Lord, any time you want a favour you
just come to me, ’cause I just dig you, man!”</p><p><br></p><p>Shocked and angry, the little Irishman watched them go, then rushed
to the altar and prostrated himself, sobbing. “What have I done that you
don’t hear my suffering and anguish? How come you don’t answer my
prayers? I have been asking for months. I don’t ask much – he is a
foreigner too, and the color of the devil himself! How come you give to
him and not so much as answer me? Ah, Holy Mary, have pity and tell me
what I’m doing so wrong!”</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly the church went dark, a deathly rush descended all around, a
steely blue light appeared above the altar and a voice boomed out:
(three finger-clicks) “I guess I just don’t dig you, man!!”</p><p><br></p><p>Prayer has to be of the heart. It has to arise from your total being.
It has to be true. Only then, and ONLY then, has something happened. God
and you should not be on formal terms. You should dig Him – only then
does He dig you.</p><p><br></p><p>Formality has killed all religion. Be informal, be friendly, be
relaxed with God. And the moment you are relaxed with God, therapy is
finished; you have entered into the world of religion. Therapy is needed
only because people have forgotten how to be religious. Therapy was not
needed in the Buddha’s time; people naturally knew how to be religious.
Therapy is a modern need – people have completely forgotten the ways of
being religious. They are Christians, they are Hindus, they are
Mohammedans, but not religious.</p><p><br></p><p>In my commune I have made it a must that everybody should pass
through therapies, because unless you pass through therapies you will
not be able to connect yourself with prayer. Therapies will help you to
unburden the garbage that has been forced on you by the society.
Therapies will help</p><p>you to cathart all the rubbish that you have repressed within
yourself. Therapies will clean you. And only in a clean, clear heart is
prayer possible. And when prayer arises, the miracle has happened.
Prayer is the greatest miracle there is.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part7>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

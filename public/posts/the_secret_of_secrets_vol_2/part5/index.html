THE FIRST IS THAT, WHEN ONE HAS ENTERED THE STATE OF MEDITATION, THE GODS ARE IN THE VALLEY. MEN ARE HEARD TALKING AS THOUGH AT A DISTANCE OF SEVERAL HUNDRED PACES, EACH ONE QUITE CLEAR. BUT THE SOUNDS ARE ALL LIKE AN ECHO IN A VALLEY. ONE CAN ALWAYS HEAR THEM, BUT NEVER ONESELF. THIS IS CALLED: ‘THE PRESENCE OF THE GODS IN THE VALLEY.’\nAT TIMES THE FOLLOWING CAN BE EXPERIENCED: AS SOON AS ONE IS QUIET, THE LIGHT OF THE EYES BEGINS TO BLAZE UP, SO THAT EVERYTHING BEFORE ONE BECOMES QUITE BRIGHT AS IF ONE WERE IN A CLOUD. IF ONE OPENS ONE’S EYES AND SEEKS THE BODY, IT IS NOT TO BE FOUND ANY MORE. THIS IS CALLED: ‘IN THE EMPTY CHAMBER IT GROWS LIGHT’. INSIDE AND OUTSIDE, EVERYTHING IS EQUALLY LIGHT. THAT IS A VERY FAVORABLE SIGN.\nOR, WHEN ONE SITS IN MEDITATION, THE FLESHLY BODY BECOMES QUITE SHINING LIKE SILK OR JADE. IT SEEMS DIFFICULT TO REMAIN SITTING: ONE FEELS AS IF DRAWN UPWARD. THIS IS CALLED: ‘THE SPIRIT RETURNS AND TOUCHES HEAVEN’. IN TIME, ONE CAN EXPERIENCE IT IN SUCH A WAY THAT ONE REALLY FLOATS UPWARD.\nAND NOW, IT IS ALREADY POSSIBLE TO HAVE ALL THREE OF THESE EXPERIENCES. BUT NOT EVERYTHING CAN BE EXPRESSED. DIFFERENT THINGS APPEAR TO EACH PERSON ACCORDING TO HIS DISPOSITION. IF ONE EXPERIENCES THESE THINGS, IT IS A SIGN OF A GOOD APTITUDE. WITH THESE THINGS IT IS JUST AS IT IS WHEN ONE DRINKS WATER:\nONE CAN TELL FOR ONESELF WHETHER THE WATER IS WARM OR COLD. IN THE SAME WAY A MAN MUST CONVINCE HIMSELF ABOUT THESE EXPERIENCES, THEN ONLY ARE THEY REAL.\nMASTER LU-TSU SAID: WHEN THERE IS A GRADUAL SUCCESS IN PRODUCING THE CIRCULATION OF THE LIGHT, A MAN MUST NOT GIVE UP HIS ORDINARY OCCUPATION IN DOING IT. THE ANCIENTS SAID: WHEN OCCUPATIONS COME TO US, WE MUST ACCEPT THEM; WHEN THINGS COME TO US, WE MUST UNDERSTAND THEM FROM THE GROUND UP. IF THE OCCUPATIONS ARE PROPERLY HANDLED BY CORRECT THOUGHTS, THE LIGHT IS NOT SCATTERED BY OUTSIDE THINGS, BUT CIRCULATES ACCORDING TO ITS OWN LAW. EVEN THE STILL INVISIBLE CIRCULATION OF THE LIGHT GETS STARTED THIS WAY; HOW MUCH MORE, THEN, IS IT THE CASE WITH THE TRUE CIRCULATION OF THE LIGHT WHICH HAS ALREADY MANIFESTED ITSELF CLEARLY.\nWHEN IN ORDINARY LIFE ONE HAS THE ABILITY ALWAYS TO REACT TO THINGS BY REFLEXES ONLY, WITHOUT ANY ADMIXTURE OF A THOUGHT OF OTHERS OR OF ONESELF, THAT IS A CIRCULATION OF THE LIGHT ARISING OUT OF CIRCUMSTANCES. THIS IS THE FIRST SECRET.\nIF EARLY IN THE MORNING, ONE CAN RID ONESELF OF ALL ENTANGLEMENTS AND MEDITATE FROM ONE TO TWO DOUBLE HOURS, AND THEN CAN ORIENTATE ONESELF TOWARDS ALL ACTIVITIES AND OUTSIDE THINGS IN A PURELY OBJECTIVE, REFLEX WAY, AND IF THIS CAN BE CONTINUED WITHOUT ANY INTERRUPTION, THEN AFTER TWO OR THREE MONTHS ALL THE PERFECTED ONES COME FROM HEAVEN AND APPROVE SUCH BEHAVIOR.\nIT WAS A BEAUTIFUL MORNING. It must have been a morning like this. The breeze was cool and full of the sweet smell of the wet earth. The birds were singing and the sun was rising on the horizon. The dewdrops were shining on the grass leaves like pearls.\nIt is always beautiful; all that is needed is eyes to see it. The birds are there, singing every morning, but who is there to listen? And the trees are blooming, but who is there to appreciate? The aesthetic heart is absent, only the calculating mind is functioning. Hence you live in an ugly world.\nI am relating to you an ancient story.\nGautam Buddha’s sannyasins were meditating under the mango trees...\nMorning is the best time to meditate. After the whole night’s rest you are very close to the center of your being. It is easier to move into the center consciously early in the morning than at any other time – because for the whole night you have been there at the center, you have just left it. The world of a thousand and one things has not yet arisen. You are just on the way, moving towards things, moving into the outside world, but the inner center is very close, around the comer. Just a turning of the head, and you will be able to see that which is: truth, God, enlightenment. You will be able to see that into which you had gone when dreams had stopped and sleep was profound, but then you were unconscious.\nDeep sleep rejuvenates because, although unconsciously, you enter into the core of your being – but you still enter. All the tiredness of the outside world is taken away, and all the wounds are healed, and all the dust disappears. You have taken a bath, you have dived deep into your own being.\nThat’s why Patanjali says: Deep, dreamless sleep is almost like SAMADHI – but almost, not exactly SAMADHI. What is the difference? It is very small – or very great – but this much difference is there: in sleep you are unconscious, in SAMADHI you are conscious; but the space is the same.\nSo in the morning when you have just awakened and you are very close to the center... Soon the periphery will take you, will possess you; you will have to go into the world of occupations. Before you go into that external journey, have a look, so that consciously you can see who you are. This is what meditation is all about. Hence, down the ages, the morning, early morning, when the earth is awakening and the trees are awakening and the birds are awakening and the sun is awakening, when the whole atmosphere is full of awakening, you can use this situation. You can ride on this tide of awakening and you can enter into your own being, awake, alert, aware. And your whole life will be transformed. And your whole day will be transformed because then you will have a different orientation.\nThen you can go into the marketplace and still you will remain in contact with your inner core. And that is the greatest secret, the Secret of the Golden Flower.\n... Buddha’s sannyasins were meditating under the mango trees that morning...\nAs you have gathered around me, thousands had gathered around Buddha. There was nothing else to learn other than to meditate.\nBuddhas don’t teach, they only share. They don’t give you a doctrine, they certainly give you a discipline. They don’t give you beliefs, they certainly give you a taste of trust. And just a drop of the taste of trust and life is transmuted. And to connect with an awakened being, the only way is to become a little bit awakened on your own part too, because the like can meet the like. To be with a Buddha is to be a little bit more alert than life generally requires you to be. Life wants you to be automatic, robot-like. When you go to a Master, he requires that you drop your automatism, that you de-automatize yourself, that you become a little more alert, that you don’t go on looking at things but also remember your being.\n... Buddha’s disciples were meditating – such a beautiful morning is not to be missed...\nAnd when birds are praising the morning sun, you have also to praise God. And when trees are swaying in the wind, you have also to participate in this eternal dance, you have also to celebrate. Another day is born – forget the past, die to the past, be born anew.\n... Buddha had a disciple named Subhuti. Buddha was a very fortunate Master: he had TREMENDOUSLY potential disciples. A few of them were really rare beings. Subhuti is one of those rare beings who was just on the verge of Buddhahood. Just one step more and he would be a Buddha. He was coming home, every moment coming home, closer and closer to the center where ego disappears and God is born, where you die and the whole is born, when the part disappears into the whole, when the cosmos takes place and then you are no more a separate entity, trembling,\nafraid of death. Then you are part of this eternal play of existence. He was just on the verge. He was one of the MOST silent of Buddha’s disciples. He was so silent that the scriptures say that he had almost become absent. He would come and nobody would take note of him. He would pass and nobody would become aware that he had passed. He was a very silent breeze...\nOrdinarily you want to be noticed. If you are not noticed, you feel hurt. You want attention. WHO wants attention? Attention is the requirement of the ego, the ego feeds on it. So if attention is not given to you – if you come and nobody notices you, you pass and nobody says, “Good morning. How are you?” as if you had not passed – you will feel wounded. You will start thinking, “So, I am thought to be a nobody, and I will show these people who I am.”\nThe ego always hankers for attention.\n... Subhuti was so silent. his desire for attention had disappeared. And the moment desire for attention disappears, all politics disappears from your being. Then you are religious. Then you are perfectly at home with your nobodiness. Then you live a totally different life. Then you live so silently that you don’t make any fuss, that you don’t make any ripples, that you come and you go as if you had never come and you had never gone. He was, and yet he was not...\nIn fact, the moment you REALLY are, you drop all ideas of your ego. People carry the idea of the ego because they are not. Try to understand this paradox. Those who are not, they brag about themselves. They HAVE to brag, they have to prove to the world, they are constantly performing. They know if they don’t perform they are nobodies. They have to perform, they have to shout, they have to make noise, they have to force others to take note of them. Adolf Hitlers and Genghis Khans and Tamburlaines and all the stupid lot of politicians down the ages – all that they have been doing is to make more and more people take note of them. These are the people who are not.\nThe people who are are so contented with their being; who cares whether anybody takes note or not? They are so much to themselves, enough unto themselves.\nSo this is the paradox: the man who is not tries, pretends that he is much, somebody special, and the man who is pretends not, brags not, becomes a very silent existence.\n... He existed as an absence...\nAnd only in absence does real presence arise; the person disappears but presence arises.\n... He had melted slowly and disappeared as a person...\nAnd when that happens, when that miracle happens, the very absence becomes a radiant presence.\n... Subhuti was also sitting under a tree, not even meditating. Others were meditating, he was simply sitting there doing nothing. That is the HIGHEST form of meditation...\nTo DO meditation is to be just a beginner. The beginner has to DO the meditation. But one who has understood meditation cannot even think in terms of doing, because the moment you do something you are stirred. The moment you do something you are tense. The moment you do something the\nego enters again from the back door – because with the doing comes the doer. Meditation is a state of non-doing. Certainly in the beginning one has to do, but slowly slowly as meditation deepens, understanding arises, doing disappears. Then meditation is being, not doing.\nDoing is part of the world of having. Doing is another aspect of having. You have to do if you want to have; if you want to have you will have to do. And millions of people remain in the world of doing and having.\nBeyond these two there is another world: the world of being – where you don’t have anything and you are not a doer either. All is utterly silent, all is absolutely passive, not even a ripple.\n... So he was not doing meditation, remember. He was just sitting and doing nothing. And then suddenly, flowers began to fall around him. And those were not ordinary flowers, not of this world, not earthly. They were not falling from the trees, they were falling from the sky, from nowhere, out of the blue. He had never seen such beauty and such freshness and such fragrance. Those were the flowers of the beyond, Golden Flowers. He was naturally in awe and wonder. And then he heard the gods whispering to him, “We are praising you for your discourse on emptiness” Now he was\nreally puzzled. “Discourse on emptiness? But I have not spoken of emptiness,” said Subhuti.\n“You have not spoken of emptiness, we have not heard emptiness,” responded the gods. “This is true emptiness.”\nAnd blossoms showered upon Subhuti like rain.\nThis is one of the most beautiful stories I have ever come across. A great meaning is hidden there: if you are silent, if you are utterly silent, existence starts showering on you. Blessings shower on you like rain. If you are silent, if you are in the state of meditation, just being and doing nothing, the whole existence converges upon you with all its grace, with all its beauty and benediction.\nThis is the state Jesus calls the state of beatitude. For the first time you become aware of the splendor of existence. Each moment is an eternity then, and even to breathe is such a joy, such a celebration. Misery disappears the moment you disappear; misery is the shadow of the ego. And blessing is a natural phenomenon: it happens on its own the moment you are empty. The whole existence rushes in, explodes.\nLudwig Wittgenstein has said, “The mystical is not the ‘how’ of the world, but that it exists.”\nJust that it exists is the mystery. There is no need to go anywhere else: the mystery is not hidden, the mystery is all over the place. Just that it exists is the mystery of it! You need not dig deep to find the mystery. Mystery is everywhere, on the surface as much as in the depth. All that is needed is a heart that feels. All that is needed is a being that is available, open. All that is needed is alertness, alertness without any effort and tension. All that is needed is a state of meditation, and then favors from existence start showering like rain.\nThe sutras:\nMaster Lu-tsu said: NOW THERE ARE THREE CONFIRMATORY EXPERIENCES WHICH CAN BE TESTED. THE FIRST IS THAT, WHEN ONE HAS ENTERED THE STATE OF MEDITATION,\nTHE GODS ARE IN THE VALLEY. MEN ARE HEARD TALKING AS THOUGH AT A DISTANCE OF SEVERAL HUNDRED PACES, EACH ONE QUITE CLEAR. BUT THE SOUNDS ARE ALL LIKE AN ECHO IN A VALLEY: ONE CAN ALWAYS HEAR THEM, BUT NEVER ONESELF. THIS IS CALLED: ‘THE PRESENCE OF THE GODS IN THE VALLEY.’\nLu-tsu is talking about three confirmatory signs. The first he calls ‘the gods are in the valley’. Those who are moving – and you all are moving towards meditation – are going to come across these strange but tremendously beautiful spaces. The first sign that meditation has started becoming a crystallized phenomenon in you is ‘the presence of the gods in the valley’.\nWhat does this metaphor mean? It means the moment meditation starts happening in you, the whole existence becomes a valley and you are at the top of a hill. You start rising upwards. The whole world becomes a valley, far away, deep down there, and you are sitting on a sunlit hilltop. Meditation takes you upwards – not physically, but spiritually. And the phenomenon is very clear when it happens; these will be the signs.\nWhen you are moving inwards in the meditation, suddenly you will see a great distance arising between you and the noises around you. You may be sitting in a marketplace and suddenly you will see a gap is arising between you and the noises. Just a moment before those noises were almost identified with you, you were in them; now you are getting away from them. You are there physically, as you had been before; there is no need to go to the mountains – this is the way to find the real mountains of the within, this is the way to find the Himalayas within. You start moving into deep silence, and suddenly all the noises that were so close to you – and such a turmoil was there – start going far away, receding backwards. Everything is as it was before on the outside, nothing has been changed; you are sitting in the same place where you had started meditating. But as meditation deepens this will be felt: you will feel distance arising from outside things.\nMEN ARE HEARD TALKING AS THOUGH AT A DISTANCE OF SEVERAL HUNDRED PACES...\n... As if suddenly the world has gone away from you or you have gone away from the world. But each thought is quite clear. Whatsoever is being said outside is quite clear, in fact, more clear than it was before.\nThis is the magic of meditation. You are not becoming unconscious, because in unconsciousness also you will see that noises are disappearing. For example, if you have been given chloroform you will feel this same phenomenon happening: noises start going away, away, away... and they are gone – but you have fallen unconscious. You cannot hear anything clearly.\nJust the same happens in meditation, but with a difference – the noises start going away from you, but every noise becomes distinctly clear, more clear than it was before, because now a witnessing is arising.\nFirst you were also a noise in all the noises; you were lost in it. Now you are a witness, an observer, and because you are so silent you can see everything distinctly, clearly. Although noises are far away, they are more clear than ever before. Each single note is heard.\nIf in meditation you are listening to music this will happen: first you will see the music is going far away; and the second thing, simultaneously will also be felt: each note is becoming so clear and so\ndistinct as it had never been before. Before, those notes were mixed with each other, overlapping into each other. Now they are all clearcut individuals, atomic. Each single note is separate.\nMEN ARE HEARD TALKING AS THOUGH AT A DISTANCE OF SEVERAL HUNDRED PACES, EACH ONE QUITE CLEAR, BUT THE SOUNDS ARE ALL LIKE AN ECHO IN A VALLEY.\nAnd the third thing will be felt: that they are not heard directly but as if indirectly, as if they are echoes of the real sounds, not the sounds themselves. They become more insubstantial, their substance is lost. They become less material, their matter disappears; they are no more heavy, they are light. You can see their weightlessness – they are like echoes. The whole existence becomes an echo.\nThat is why Hindu mystics call the world MAYA, illusion. Illusion does not mean unreal; it simply means shadow-like, echo-like. It does not mean non-existential, it simply means dream-like. Shadow-like, dream-like, echo-like – that will be the feeling. You cannot feel that these things are real. The whole existence becomes a dream, very clear, distinct, because you are alert; and very dream-like because you are alert. First you were lost in the dream: you were not alert, and you were thinking that this is reality. You were identified with your mind. Now you are no more identified with the mind, a separate entity has arisen in you: the watchfulness, SAKSHI.\nONE CAN ALWAYS HEAR THEM, BUT NEVER ONESELF.\nAnd the fourth thing in it will be felt: you can hear the whole existence around you – people talking, walking, children laughing, somebody crying, a bird call, a car passes by, an aeroplane, the train. You will be able to hear everything. Just one thing: you will not be able to hear yourself, you have completely disappeared. You are an emptiness, you are becoming a Subhuti. You are just not there at all. You cannot feel yourself as an entity. All the noises are there, just your inner noises have disappeared. Ordinarily there are more noises inside you than on the outside. The real turmoil is within you, the real madness is there. And when the outer madness and inner madness both meet together, hell is created.\nThe outer madness is going to continue, because you have not produced it and you cannot destroy it, but you can destroy your inner madness very easily. It is within your capacity. Once the inner is not there the outer madness becomes insubstantial. It loses all reality, it becomes illusory. You cannot find your old voice; there is no thought arising in you, so no sound. This is called ‘the gods are in the valley’.\nYou have become empty, and everything has gone deep down in the valley; only echoes are heard. And when echoes are heard, certainly you are not affected.\nJust the other day a madman tried to rape Anuradha. He was caught before he could do any harm. I asked Anuradha to come to me just to see whether she’s affected by it or not. And I was tremendously happy that she is not affected at all, not at all, not even a trace. That’s the beauty of growing meditation: even if you are murdered you will remain unaffected.\nNow, the effort to rape her was murderous. And let Morarji Desai know that this is the true image of his India; an Indian tried it. And this is not a single case, it has been happening almost regularly. It has become so dangerous for my sannyasins to move outside. This ugly India is not my India. This\nugly India belongs to Moraji Desai and Charan Singh and Advani and company. I simply disown this ugly India.\nBut there is another India: the India of the Buddhas, the eternal India. I am part of it, you are part of it. In fact, anywhere, wherever meditation is happening, that person becomes part of that eternal India. That eternal India is not geographical, it is a spiritual space. And to become part of that eternal India is to become a sannyasin.\nAnd I was happy, tremendously happy, seeing Anuradha: she had remained absolutely unaffected, not a ripple of fear, nothing – as if nothing had happened, as if the attempt was made in a dream.\nThis is how one grows slowly slowly into meditation. All becomes insubstantial. One can see everything.\nShe fought back. She was courageous and brave, she did whatsoever was needed to be done, she didn’t yield – but the inner consciousness remained unaffected.\nTHIS IS CALLED THE PRESENCE OF THE GODS IN THE VALLEY. AT TIMES THE FOLLOWING CAN BE EXPERIENCED: AS SOON AS ONE IS QUIET THE LIGHT OF THE EYES BEGINS TO BLAZE UP, SO THAT EVERYTHING BEFORE ONE BECOMES QUITE BRIGHT AS IF ONE WERE IN A CLOUD. IF ONE OPENS ONE’S EYES AND SEEKS THE BODY, IT IS NOT TO BE FOUND ANY MORE. THIS IS CALLED: ‘IN THE EMPTY CHAMBER IT GROWS LIGHT’. INSIDE AND OUTSIDE, EVERYTHING IS EQUALLY LIGHT. THAT IS A VERY FAVORABLE SIGN.\nNow, the second sign is called: ‘In the empty chamber it grows light’.\nUnless you become empty, you will remain dark, you will remain darkness. ‘In the empty chamber it grows light’: when you are utterly empty, when there is nobody inside you, then light happens. The presence of the ego creates darkness. Darkness and ego are synonymous. No-ego and light are synonymous.\nSo ALL methods of meditations, whatsoever their orientation, finally verge in this empty chamber of your inner being. Just a silent space is left, and in that space you find great light arising, without any source. It is not like the light that you see when the sun rises, because the light that comes from the sun cannot be eternal; in the night it will disappear again. It is not like the light that needs fuel, because when the fuel is finished the light will disappear.\nThis light has a very mysterious quality: it has no source, no cause. It is not caused, hence once it appears it remains, it never disappears. In fact, it is already there; you are just not empty enough to see it.\nAnd when this light starts growing in you these will be the experiences, ‘as soon as one is quiet’. The moment you sit silently and you become quiet, still, unmoving within and without, ‘the light of the eyes begins to blaze up’.\nSuddenly you will see your light is pouring through your eyes. This is an experience that science has not yet become aware of. Science thinks that light gets into the eyes, but never otherwise. Light\ncomes from the outside, gets into the eyes, enters you: this is only half the story. The other half is known only by the mystics and the meditators. This is only one part: the light entering you. There is another part: the light pouring out of your eyes. And when the light starts pouring out of your eyes, ‘the light of the eyes begins to blaze up, so that everything before one becomes quite bright’.\nThen this whole existence brightens up. Then you see that trees are more green than ever, and their greenness has a quality of luminosity in it. Then you see the roses are rosier than ever. The same roses, the same trees, but something from you is pouring into them, revealing them more clearly than ever. Then small things have such beauty: just colored stones are more beautiful to a Buddha than the Kohinoor diamond to Queen Elizabeth. To Queen Elizabeth, even the Kohinoor – the greatest diamond in the world – is not so beautiful as an ordinary stone is to a Buddha. Why? – because Buddha’s eyes can pour light, and in that light ordinary stones become Kohinoors. Ordinary people become Buddhas. To a Buddha, everything is full of Buddhahood. Hence he has said, “The day I became enlightened, the whole existence became enlightened. The trees and the mountains and the rivers and the rocks – all became enlightened.” The whole existence was raised to a higher plenitude.\nIt depends on you how much you can put into existence; only that much will you get. If you don’t put anything into it you won’t get anything out of it. First you have to put into it to get out of it. That’s why creative people know more beauty, more love, more joy than uncreative people – because creative people put something into existence. Existence responds... and responds generously.\nYour eyes are empty: they don’t give anything, they only take. They are hoarders, they don’t share. So whenever you will come across eyes which can share, you will see a tremendously different quality, a tremendous beauty, silence, power, potential. If you can see those eyes which can pour their light into you, your whole heart will be stirred.\nBut even to see that light you will have to be a little more alert than you are. The sun may be rising and it may be morning, but you may be fast asleep. But then no sun is rising for you, and there is no morning; you may be lost in a dark night, in a nightmare. You have to be a little more wakeful, but this happens.\nIn the modern consciousness an experience of this kind has come through psychedelics, a little bit. It is forced, it is violent. It is not natural, you are raping your chemistry. But the experience has happened, and many people have come to meditation through drugs because the drug has made them aware of something they were never aware of.\nWhen you have taken some drug, the world looks more beautiful. Ordinary things look extraordinary. What is happening? The drug is forcing some inner light from your eyes to fall onto things – but it is a forced phenomenon, and dangerous. And after each drug-trip you will fall into a deeper darkness than before. And in the person who has been taking drugs long, you will find his eyes UTTERLY empty because he has been pouring light out of his eyes and he does not know how to create it. He does not know how to make his inner light circulate so that more light is created; he simply pours. So a man who takes drugs, by and by, loses the vitality of his eyes, the youth of his eyes. His eyes become dull, dark, black holes.\nJust the opposite happens through meditation: the more quiet you become, the more light is created – and it is not a forced phenomenon. You have so much that it starts overflowing from your eyes. It\nsimply starts overflowing. Because you have too much it has to be shared, like when the cloud is full of rain it has to rain. You are full of light and more light is coming in, streaming in every moment, and there is no end to it – now you can share. You can share with the trees and with the rocks and with people. You can give to the existence. This is a very favorable sign.\nBut don’t be deceived by drugs. Drugs give you only false experiences, forced experiences, and any forced experience is destructive to your inner ecology, your inner harmony and finally you will be a loser, not a gainer.\nAT TIMES THE FOLLOWING CAN BE EXPERIENCED: AS SOON AS ONE IS QUIET, THE LIGHT OF THE EYES BEGINS TO BLAZE UP.\nYou will see it! Your eyes are becoming aflame. And with the eyes becoming aflame the whole existence is taking a new color, a new depth, a new dimension, as if things are no more three- dimensional but four-dimensional. A new dimension is added: the dimension of luminosity.\n... THE LIGHT OF THE EYES BEGINS TO BLAZE UP, SO THAT EVERYTHING BEFORE ONE BECOMES QUITE BRIGHT, AS IF ONE WERE IN A CLOUD...\n... as if the sun is shining on the cloud and the whole cloud is afire, and you are in the cloud and the cloud is just fire reflecting the sun. One starts living in this cloud of light. One sleeps in it, one walks in it, one sits in it; this cloud continues. This cloud has been seen as the aura. Those who have eyes to see will see around the head of the saints, around their bodies, a light. A subtle aura surrounds them.\nNow even science is agreeing with it, particularly in Russia. Kirlian photography has come to very significant conclusions. One of them is: that everything is surrounded by a subtle aura – we just need eyes to see – and in different states the aura changes. Now these are scientific conclusions. When you are ill you have a different aura – dull, sad, lusterless. If you are going to die within six months your aura disappears. Then your body has no light around it. And if you are happy, joyous, fulfilled, contented, then the aura grows more and more big, becomes more and more bright.\nOf course Kirlian experiments have not been done on any Buddha yet. And it is very difficult to find a Bud\u0026a in Soviet Russia, particularly now. It is unfortunate, because the whole country has fallen into a trap of utter nonsense. The whole country has fallen into the trap of materialism. Never before has any country been ruled by materialists. Materialism has always persisted, but never has a country been ruled by materialists. Never has a country been conditioned to be materialistic like Soviet Russia. Children are taught there is no God, no soul, that man is just a body. There is no question of prayer, no question of meditation, no question of becoming silent.\nIf Kirlian photographers come across a man like Jesus or Buddha or Subhuti, then they will know the miracle. Then they will come across the purest light, the coolest light – which is light, which is life, which is love.\nIF ONE OPENS ONE’S EYES AND SEEKS THE BODY...\nIn this moment, when you are full of light inside and your eyes are afire and the whole existence is aflame with new life, if you open your eyes and try to find your body, you will not find it. In\nthese moments matter disappears. In fact, modern physics says that there is no matter at all; it is an illusion. There is nothing solid in your body. Deep down, modern physics says, your body is constituted of electrons. Electrons mean light-atoms, atoms of light. So when this inner fire burns bright, is REALLY there, and you open your eyes, you will not find your physical body. Not that it is not there; it is there, but you will not see it as you had seen it before. It will be just a cloud of light. You will see the aura; the gestalt has changed. Now you will see something which you had never seen before, and ali that you had seen before has disappeared; it depends on your vision. Because you don’t have a vision to see the spirit, you can only see the body, the physical. To see matter, nothing is needed – no intelligence, no meditativeness, no prayer. To see matter is very gross. To see spirit is very subtle.\nOnce you are capable of seeing the spirit, you will be able to see that matter has disappeared. You cannot see both together. Again let me repeat: that’s why Hindu mystics have called the world illusory, because they have come to a point when they have seen that matter does not exist. And all that exists is God, all that exists is consciousness.\nMatter is just a mistake. You have not seen rightly; that’s how matter arises. It IS consciousness. For example, when I see you I see you as consciousness, not as matter. When I touch you I don’t touch your body, I touch you in your innermost core, I touch your energy. When I look into your eyes I’m not looking into your physical eyes, I’m trying to contact your spiritual eye. It is there. To you, it is not there yet. For me, it is already there. And if you listen to me, and if you try to understand what is being shared with you, soon it will become a reality for you too.\nEither God is or the world is; both are never found together. Those who see the world never see God, and those who have seen God, for them the world has disappeared. The ‘world’ was just a misunderstanding. It is just like you can commit a mistake while counting or doing arithmetic: two plus two, and you can put five; then the whole thing will go wrong. When you go back and you find the mistake and yOu correct it and two plus two becomes four again, the whole thing changes. Exactly like this, matter is a mistake of vision.\nIt is just like Hindu mystics say: it is a rope seen in darkness, and you have thought it is a snake. And because you thought it is a snake you start running. And your heart is pounding, and you are out of breath, and you are trembling, and it is a cool night but you are perspiring. You may even have a heart attack, and for no reason at all! And in the morning, when it is found to have been just a rope, it will look very ridiculous.\nOnce I was staying in a house with a friend. There were so many mice in the house, and rats. It happened that night that a rat must have entered into the bed of my friend when we were asleep. The rat was just going to bite, just going to bite his foot, and he was awakened. He jumped out of the bed, screamed; the rat must have escaped. Nothing was harmed – he was just going to bite – but he became very much afraid. He was afraid that maybe it was a snake. And I said, “You are a fool! There is no snake, nothing” – and we looked around – “and we know that there are so many rats in your house. It must have been a rat.” So he was satisfied; we went to sleep. Everything was perfectly good.\nWe went to the river, we swam in the river, we came back. After lunch a snake was found in the house, and immediately my friend became unconscious – the very idea! And I tried hard, but now he was already unconscious, so what to do?\nFor one and a half hours he remained unconscious, in a kind of coma. Doctors were called, they checked. They said, “There is no poison, nothing. Even the rat has not done any harm, and there is no question of any snake.” But still injections were given to bring him back. Just the idea... but the idea can create a reality.\nWhen you see a rope and you start running, your running is a reality, and your heart pounding is a reality. And you may have a heart attack, you may even die – this is a reality! But the snake was not there; that was just an idea.\nThe mystics say the world is just an idea. You are unnecessarily afraid, unnecessarily running away, unnecessarily worried – it is just an idea, a mistake. There is no world, there is only God.\nThe whole consists only of consciousness.\nIF ONE OPENS ONE’S EYES AND SEEKS THE BODY, IT IS NOT TO BE FOUND ANY MORE. THIS IS CALLED: ‘IN THE EMPTY CHAMBER IT GROWS LIGHT’. INSIDE AND OUTSIDE, EVERYTHING IS EQUALLY LIGHT. THAT IS A VERY FAVORABLE SIGN.\nThese have to be understood because these are going to happen to you too, and the understanding will help. Otherwise one day you open your eyes and you don’t find your body there, you may go crazy. You will certainly feel something has gone wrong: either you are dead or mad. And what has happened to the body? But if you understand these sutras, they will remind you in the right moment. That’s why I am talking on so many scriptures: to make you aware of all that is possible, so when it happens you are not taken aback. You know, you can understand, you have maps already. You can figure out where you are and you can rest in that understanding.\nOR WHEN ONE SITS IN MEDITATION, THE FLESHLY BODY BECOMES QUITE SHINING LIKE SILK OR JADE. IT SEEMS DIFFICULT TO REMAIN SITTING; ONE FEELS AS IS DRAWN UPWARD. THIS IS CALLED: ‘THE SPIRIT RETURNS AND TOUCHES HEAVEN’. IN TIME, ONE CAN EXPERIENCE IT IN SUCH A WAY THAT ONE REALLY FLOATS UPWARD.\nThe third sign: ‘The spirit returns and touches heaven’.\nThis happens very soon; it starts happening in the very early stages. Sitting silently, suddenly you feel you are a little higher than the ground, maybe six inches higher. With great surprise you open your eyes and you find you are sitting on the ground, so you must have been dreaming, you think.\nNo, you have not been dreaming, your physical body remained on the earth. But you have another body, the body of light hidden inside it – call it the astral body, the subtle body, the vital body, any name you want – that body starts rising higher. And from the inside you can feel only that body, because that is your inside. When you open your eyes your material body is sitting on the ground perfectly, in the same way as it was sitting before. Don’t think that you have been hallucinating, not at all. It is a real fact: you had floated a little – but in your second body not in your first body.\nTHE FLESHLY BODY BECOMES QUITE SHINING LIKE SILK OR JADE.\nAnd simultaneously, whenever you will feel that you have risen above the ground – as if gravitation affects you no more, as if a different law has started working on you.I call that law ’the law of\ngrace’. One law is the law of gravitation: it pulls you down. I call the other law the law of grace; it pulls you up. And certainly, sooner or later, science has to discover it, because every law has to be complemented by its opposite. No law can exist in aloneness. Gravitation must have its complementary, just as day has night and summer has winter and man has woman and love has hate and life has death and the negative has the positive. So, exactly in the same way, there MUST be a law which has to compensate, complement from the other extreme. That law I call the law of grace; it pulls you upwards.\nThis experience of your fleshly body becoming quite shining like silk or jade, happens simultaneously whenever you start feeling that it is DIFFICULT TO REMAIN SITTING; ONE FEELS AS IF DRAWN UPWARD. THIS IS CALLED: ‘THE SPIRIT RETURNS AND TOUCHES HEAVEN’.\nNow the upward journey is starting. And remember, the upward and inward are synonymous; outward and downward are synonymous. The more in you go, the more up you go. The deeper you reach upwards, the deeper you reach inwards. They are the same, one dimension, two aspects of the same dimension.\nIN TIME, ONE CAN EXPERIENCE IT IN SUCH A WAY THAT ONE REALLY FLOATS UPWARD.\nAnd that too happens: when this inner body starts rising so high and has tremendous power, then even the physical body can start floating with it. It is possible, but there is no need to make it happen. That is foolish. If it happens one day of its own accord, enjoy it and don’t take much note of it. These confirmatory signs have to be understood, not bragged about. Don’t talk to anybody about them, otherwise the ego will come back and will start exploiting these experiences. And once the ego comes, experiences will disappear. Never talk about them. If they happen just understand them, take note of them, and forget all about them.\nAND NOW, IT IS ALREADY POSSIBLE TO HAVE ALL THREE OF THESE EXPERIENCES. BUT NOT EVERYTHING CAN BE EXPRESSED.\nThese three experiences ARE possible, and even if you have experienced them, you will not be able to express them. And whatsoever is said here is only just symbolic, because the real experience cannot be said. All that is said becomes a lie. Say it, and you have falsified the truth. Truth cannot be said, but still we have to say something. Hence these metaphors have been developed: ‘gods in the valley’, ‘in the empty chamber it grows light’, ‘the spirit returns upwards’, or ‘the spirit returns and touches heaven’. These are just symbols, metaphors to indicate something, but the experience is vast!\nDIFFERENT THINGS APPEAR TO EACH PERSON ACCORDING TO HIS DISPOSITION.\nAnd this too has to be remembered: they all may not happen to you, or may happen in a different order, or may happen in different ways. And there are a thousand and one things too which are possible because people are so different. To somebody these experiences may not happen the way they have been described. For example, to somebody it may not happen that he is rising upward; it may happen that he is becoming bigger, becoming bigger and bigger; the whole room is full of him. And then he goes on becoming bigger and bigger; now the house is inside him. And it is very puzzling. One wants to open one’s eyes and see what is happening – “Am I going mad?” And a\nmoment is possible when one sees that “The whole existence is inside me. I am not outside it. It is not outside me, it is inside me. And the stars are moving within me.”\nOr to somebody it may happen that he becomes smaller and smaller, becomes a molecule, almost invisible, then an atom, and then disappears. That is possible. Patanjali has catalogued all the experiences that are possible. People have different dispositions, different talents, different potentials, so to everybody they are going to happen in a different way. These are just to indicate that things like this happen – don’t think that you are going mad or something is going bizarre.\nWITH THESE THINGS IT IS JUST AS IT IS WHEN ONE DRINKS WATER. ONE CAN TELL FOR ONESELF WHETHER THE WATER IS WARM OR COLD.\nIt is an experience. When you drink water, only you know whether it is cold or warm. And if you are thirsty, only you know whether it is quenching your thirst or creating more. Nobody else sitting outside watching you can know what is happening inside – if the thirst is quenched or made more, if the water is cool or warm – nobody can see from the outside. Even if they can see you drinking water, they cannot experience your experience. People can see you meditating, but they cannot see what is happening inside.\nMany people come here and they ask me for permission to watch people meditating. And I say, “How will you watch?” Nobody has ever been able to watch. You can see people sitting or dancing or singing, but that is not the real thing. Meditation is happening inside them. Nobody can see except them. So if you really want to see, you will have to participate. You will have to become a meditator; that is the only way. You cannot borrow, nobody can inform you. So those who come here as spectators just waste their time. These are things which can be known only through participation.\nIN THE SAME WAY A MAN MUST CONVINCE HIMSELF ABOUT THESE EXPERIENCES, THEN ONLY ARE THEY REAL.\nAnd don’t start believing because Lu-tsu is saying so. Just try to understand him, keep it stored in your memory. There is no need to believe in these things, no need to disbelieve either. Just let them be in your memory so whenever the time is ripe and something starts happening you will be able to understand. These are just giving you maps so you are not lost – because even in the inward journey there are many points from where one can be lost. One can misunderstand, one can become afraid, frightened. One can escape from the inside into the outside world.\nAnd these experiences are NOT frightening, but your interpretation can make them frightening. Just think: one day you open your eyes and you don’t see your body. Your interpretation can be frightening: “This is certainly a sign of madness.” You will stop meditating, you will become afraid of meditation, because who knows now what will happen next time, and where you are moving, where you are going. You will become suspicious of the whole experience. You will think you are becoming neurotic.\nEvery day people come to me with their experiences. When they relate their experiences, I can see their fear, their faces, their eyes – they are afraid. When I say that these are good signs, immediately the climate changes. They start laughing, they are happy. If they can hear me saying that “This is beautiful”, that “I am happy with you” that “You are growing well”, IMMEDIATELY there is a great\nchange. From sadness they jump to great joy. Nothing has changed, their experience is the same; I have just given them a different interpretation. They were frightened because they knew not.\nThese things have not to be believed or disbelieved, but just kept stored in the memory so if the time arises you will be able to interpret rightly – and right interpretations are of GREAT significance. Otherwise the inner journey becomes very difficult. There are many points from where one wants to return and go back into the world and be normal.\nOne starts feeling something abnormal is happening, and ‘abnormal’ is a condemnatory word. And if you talk to other people who have never meditated they will say, “You go to the psychoanalyst or the psychiatrist. Better that you be checked. What nonsense are you talking? – that you become bigger! Have you lost all reason? You say that you go upward and gravitation disappears? Or you become smaller and smaller and you disappear? You are hallucinating, you have become a victim of illusions. You go to the psychiatrist – he will put you right, he will fix you.”\nAnd if you go to the psychoanalyst or the psychiatrist, they ARE going to fix you: they will hammer on your head with their so-called knowledge. They don’t know a thing about meditation, meditation has not entered in their consciousness yet. They don’t know anything about the experiences that happen on the Way, but they know much about mad people. And there is one thing to be taken note of: that there are many experiences which are similar, which happen to a meditator and also happen to a madman; which are so similar that the psychiatrist is BOUND to think that you are going nuts, that something has to be fixed in you. And he will treat you as a madman – he will give you drugs or injections or electro-shocks to bring you back to your normal mind. He may destroy your whole possibility for meditation.\nThis is now a great danger in the West: people learning meditation go back to the West, and if something happens which is not within their comprehension, and they talk to the priest – and the Christian priest knows nothing about meditation – he will send them to the psychiatrist. If they talk to the psychiatrist, he knows only about madmen, he knows nothing about Buddhas. And a few of their experiences are similar; he is bound to interpret that you have fallen below normality, you have to be pulled back. And whatsoever he will do will be destructive, will be harmful to your body, to your mind. The harm carl be so much that never again will you be able to go into meditation – he can create SUCH barriers.\nSo if something happens sometimes, always go to people who meditate. That’s why I am insisting so much to open centers all over the world so sannyasins can meditate, and if something happens they can meet sannyasins, they can go and share their experiences. At least there will be somebody sympathetic. At least there will be somebody who will not condemn you, who will respect your experience, who will accept your experience, who will give you hope and inspiration, who will say, “Good. you go ahead. Much more is going to happen.” A Master is needed only because of this – somebody whom you can trust and who’s simply saying “It is good, and you can go ahead”, and you CAN go ahead. The journey is hazardous.\nMaster Lu-tsu said: WHEN THERE IS A GRADUAL SUCCESS IN PRODUCING THE CIRCULATION OF THE LIGHT, A MAN MUST NOT GIVE UP HIS ORDINARY OCCUPATION IN DOING IT.\nThat’s my insistence too: that a sannyasin should not renounce the world. Your meditation SHOULD grow in the world. It should be part of the day-to-day existence. You should not become an escapist. Why?\nTHE ANCIENTS SAID, ’WHEN OCCUPATIONS COME TO US, WE MUST ACCEPT THEM; WHEN THINGS COME TO US, WE MUST UNDERSTAND THEM FROM THE GROUND UP. IF THE OCCUPATIONS ARE PROPERLY HANDLED BY CORRECT THOUGHTS, THE LIGHT IS NOT SCATTERED BY OUTSIDE THINGS, BUT CIRCULATES ACCORDING TO ITS OWN LAW. EVEN THE STILL INVISIBLE CIRCULATION OF THE LIGHT GETS STARTED THIS WAY; HOW MUCH MORE, THEN, IS IT THE CASE WITH THE TRUE CIRCULATION OF THE LIGHT WHICH HAS ALREADY MANIFESTED ITSELF CLEARLY.\nFirst, whatsoever situation you are in is a God-given situation; don’t reject it. It is an opportunity, an occasion to grow. If you escape from the opportunity, you will not grow. The people who go to the Himalayan caves and start living there and become very much attached to the caves remain ungrownup. They remain childish. They have not become seasoned. If you bring them to the world they will be shattered, they will not be able to bear it.\nJust a few days ago one sannyasin came after three months of living in the Himalayas, and she said, “But now it is difficult to be here. I want to go back.” Now this is not gaining in maturity. Now the Himalayas will become her obsession, and whatsoever she is thinking is her meditation, her silence, is not hers; it is just a by-product of the Himalayan silence. I told her, “You be here for three weeks, and then you tell me what happens to your silence and your meditation. If it disappears, then it has nothing to do with you. And then it is better not to go to the Himalayas. Grow in meditation here! If you can be meditative here in the marketplace, and then you go to the Himalayas, your meditation will be enhanced a thousandfold. It is good as a holiday, but don’t cling there; always come back to the world.”\nYes, it is good once in a while to move into the mountains, it is beautiful, but to become addicted, to start thinking of renouncing the world is utterly wrong – because it is in the storms of the world that integrity arises. It is in the challenges of the world that you crystallize.\nLu-tsu says, “Accept the situation you are in. It must be the right situation for you; that’s why you are in it.” Existence cares for you. It is given to you not without any reason. It is not accidental; NOTHING IS accidental. Whatsoever is your need is given to you. If it were your need to be in the Himalayas, you would have been in the Himalayas. And when the need arises, you will find that either you go to the Himalayas or the Himalayas come to you. It happens... when the disciple is ready, the Master arrives. And when your inner silence is ready, God arrives. And whatsoever is needed on the path is always supplied. Existence cares, mothers.\nSo don’t be worried. Rather, use the opportunity. This challenging world, this constant turmoil on the outside, has to be used. You have to be a witness to it. Watch it. Learn how not to be affected by it. Learn to remain unaffected, untouched by it, like a lotus leaf in water. And then you will be grateful, because it is only by being watchful of all the turmoil that one day suddenly, ‘the gods are in the valley’. You see the marketplace disappearing far away, becoming an echo. This is REAL growth.\nAnd if you can rightly be meditative in the ordinary occupations of life, there is nothing which cannot happen to you. The light will start circulating; you just be watchful.\nMeditate in the morning and then keep close to your center. Go into the world but keep close to your center, go on remembering yourself. Remain conscious of what you are doing.\nWHEN IN ORDINARY LIFE ONE HAS THE ABILITY ALWAYS TO REACT TO THINGS BY REFLEXES ONLY, WITHOUT ANY ADMIXTURE OF A THOUGHT OF OTHERS OR OF ONESELF, THAT IS A CIRCULATION OF THE LIGHT ARISING OUT OF CIRCUMSTANCES. THIS IS THE FIRST SECRET.\nAnd when things arise, act, but don’t get identified in the act. Remain a spectator. Do whatsoever is needful just like a reflex. Do whatsoever is needful, but don’t become a doer, don’t get involved in it. Do it, and be finished with it – like a reflex.\nIF EARLY IN THE MORNING, ONE CAN RID ONESELF OF ALL ENTANGLEMENTS AND MEDITATE FROM ONE TO TWO DOUBLE HOURS, AND THEN CAN ORIENTATE ONESELF TOWARDS ALL ACTIVITIES AND OUTSIDE THINGS IN A PURELY OBJECTIVE REFLEX WAY, AND IF THIS CAN BE CONTINUED WITHOUT ANY INTERRUPTION, THEN AFTER TWO OR THREE MONTHS ALL THE PERFECTED ONES COME FROM HEAVEN AND APPROVE SUCH BEHAVIOR.\nBehave in an objective way. Take note of the situation, and whatsoever is needful, do it. But don’t become attached to the doing, don’t become worried about it, don’t think of the result. Just do the needful and remain alert and aloof and distant and faraway in your center, rooted there. But every early morning, orient yourself towards the inner center so you can remember it your whole day.\nTwo times are the best. The first best time is the early morning: orient yourself to the center so you can live on the circumference but yet with full remembrance of the center. And the second time is before you go to bed: orient yourself again to the center, so in your deep sleep also – even while you are dreaming, while you are unconscious – you can remain more and more, closer and closer to the center. These two times are the best. And if you can meditate these two times, you need not go anywhere else. You need not go to any monastery, to any cave, you need not renounce the world, and one day suddenly you will see blossoms showering on you and gods whispering in your ear.\nThe whole existence celebrates the moment when one soul arrives home. What happened to Subhuti can happen to you. Aspire to it. It is your birthright, it can be claimed.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"9750","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_secret_of_secrets_vol_2/part5/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_secret_of_secrets_vol_2/>The Secret of Secrets, Vol 2</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">5 The spirit returns and touches heaven</h1><div class=post-meta>46 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;9750 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Secret_of_Secrets_Vol_2/part5.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part4>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

TOUCHES HEAVEN’. IN TIME, ONE CAN EXPERIENCE IT IN SUCH A WAY THAT ONE
REALLY FLOATS UPWARD.</p><p><br></p><p>AND NOW, IT IS ALREADY POSSIBLE TO HAVE ALL THREE OF THESE
EXPERIENCES. BUT NOT EVERYTHING CAN BE EXPRESSED. DIFFERENT THINGS
APPEAR TO EACH PERSON ACCORDING TO HIS DISPOSITION. IF ONE EXPERIENCES
THESE THINGS, IT IS A SIGN OF A GOOD APTITUDE. WITH THESE THINGS IT IS
JUST AS IT IS WHEN ONE DRINKS WATER:</p><p>ONE CAN TELL FOR ONESELF WHETHER THE WATER IS WARM OR COLD. IN THE
SAME WAY A MAN MUST CONVINCE HIMSELF ABOUT THESE EXPERIENCES, THEN ONLY
ARE THEY REAL.</p><p><br></p><p>MASTER LU-TSU SAID: WHEN THERE IS A GRADUAL SUCCESS IN PRODUCING THE
CIRCULATION OF THE LIGHT, A MAN MUST NOT GIVE UP HIS ORDINARY OCCUPATION
IN DOING IT. THE ANCIENTS SAID: WHEN OCCUPATIONS COME TO US, WE MUST
ACCEPT THEM; WHEN THINGS COME TO US, WE MUST UNDERSTAND THEM FROM THE
GROUND UP. IF THE OCCUPATIONS ARE PROPERLY HANDLED BY CORRECT THOUGHTS,
THE LIGHT IS NOT SCATTERED BY OUTSIDE THINGS, BUT CIRCULATES ACCORDING
TO ITS OWN LAW. EVEN THE STILL INVISIBLE CIRCULATION OF THE LIGHT GETS
STARTED THIS WAY; HOW MUCH MORE, THEN, IS IT THE CASE WITH THE TRUE
CIRCULATION OF THE LIGHT WHICH HAS ALREADY MANIFESTED ITSELF
CLEARLY.</p><p><br></p><p>WHEN IN ORDINARY LIFE ONE HAS THE ABILITY ALWAYS TO REACT TO THINGS
BY REFLEXES ONLY, WITHOUT ANY ADMIXTURE OF A THOUGHT OF OTHERS OR OF
ONESELF, THAT IS A CIRCULATION OF THE LIGHT ARISING OUT OF
CIRCUMSTANCES. THIS IS THE FIRST SECRET.</p><p><br></p><p>IF EARLY IN THE MORNING, ONE CAN RID ONESELF OF ALL ENTANGLEMENTS AND
MEDITATE FROM ONE TO TWO DOUBLE HOURS, AND THEN CAN ORIENTATE ONESELF
TOWARDS ALL ACTIVITIES AND OUTSIDE THINGS IN A PURELY OBJECTIVE, REFLEX
WAY, AND IF THIS CAN BE CONTINUED WITHOUT ANY INTERRUPTION, THEN AFTER
TWO OR THREE MONTHS ALL THE PERFECTED ONES COME FROM HEAVEN AND APPROVE
SUCH BEHAVIOR.</p><p><br></p><p>IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL MORNING. It must have been a morning like this.
The breeze was cool and full of the sweet smell of the wet earth. The
birds were singing and the sun was rising on the horizon. The dewdrops
were shining on the grass leaves like pearls.</p><p><br></p><p>It is always beautiful; all that is needed is eyes to see it. The
birds are there, singing every morning, but who is there to listen? And
the trees are blooming, but who is there to appreciate? The aesthetic
heart is absent, only the calculating mind is functioning. Hence you
live in an ugly world.</p><p><br></p><p>I am relating to you an ancient story.</p><p><br></p><p>Gautam Buddha’s sannyasins were meditating under the mango
trees...</p><p><br></p><p>Morning is the best time to meditate. After the whole night’s rest
you are very close to the center of your being. It is easier to move
into the center consciously early in the morning than at any other time
– because for the whole night you have been there at the center, you
have just left it. The world of a thousand and one things has not yet
arisen. You are just on the way, moving towards things, moving into the
outside world, but the inner center is very close, around the comer.
Just a turning of the head, and you will be able to see that which is:
truth, God, enlightenment. You will be able to see that into which you
had gone when dreams had stopped and sleep was profound, but then you
were unconscious.</p><p>Deep sleep rejuvenates because, although unconsciously, you enter
into the core of your being – but you still enter. All the tiredness of
the outside world is taken away, and all the wounds are healed, and all
the dust disappears. You have taken a bath, you have dived deep into
your own being.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why Patanjali says: Deep, dreamless sleep is almost like
SAMADHI – but almost, not exactly SAMADHI. What is the difference? It is
very small – or very great – but this much difference is there: in sleep
you are unconscious, in SAMADHI you are conscious; but the space is the
same.</p><p><br></p><p>So in the morning when you have just awakened and you are very close
to the center... Soon the periphery will take you, will possess you; you
will have to go into the world of occupations. Before you go into that
external journey, have a look, so that consciously you can see who you
are. This is what meditation is all about. Hence, down the ages, the
morning, early morning, when the earth is awakening and the trees are
awakening and the birds are awakening and the sun is awakening, when the
whole atmosphere is full of awakening, you can use this situation. You
can ride on this tide of awakening and you can enter into your own
being, awake, alert, aware. And your whole life will be transformed. And
your whole day will be transformed because then you will have a
different orientation.</p><p><br></p><p>Then you can go into the marketplace and still you will remain in
contact with your inner core. And that is the greatest secret, the
Secret of the Golden Flower.</p><p><br></p><p>... Buddha’s sannyasins were meditating under the mango trees that
morning...</p><p><br></p><p>As you have gathered around me, thousands had gathered around Buddha.
There was nothing else to learn other than to meditate.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddhas don’t teach, they only share. They don’t give you a doctrine,
they certainly give you a discipline. They don’t give you beliefs, they
certainly give you a taste of trust. And just a drop of the taste of
trust and life is transmuted. And to connect with an awakened being, the
only way is to become a little bit awakened on your own part too,
because the like can meet the like. To be with a Buddha is to be a
little bit more alert than life generally requires you to be. Life wants
you to be automatic, robot-like. When you go to a Master, he requires
that you drop your automatism, that you de-automatize yourself, that you
become a little more alert, that you don’t go on looking at things but
also remember your being.</p><p><br></p><p>... Buddha’s disciples were meditating – such a beautiful morning is
not to be missed...</p><p><br></p><p>And when birds are praising the morning sun, you have also to praise
God. And when trees are swaying in the wind, you have also to
participate in this eternal dance, you have also to celebrate. Another
day is born – forget the past, die to the past, be born anew.</p><p><br></p><p>... Buddha had a disciple named Subhuti. Buddha was a very fortunate
Master: he had TREMENDOUSLY potential disciples. A few of them were
really rare beings. Subhuti is one of those rare beings who was just on
the verge of Buddhahood. Just one step more and he would be a Buddha. He
was coming home, every moment coming home, closer and closer to the
center where ego disappears and God is born, where you die and the whole
is born, when the part disappears into the whole, when the cosmos takes
place and then you are no more a separate entity, trembling,</p><p>afraid of death. Then you are part of this eternal play of existence.
He was just on the verge. He was one of the MOST silent of Buddha’s
disciples. He was so silent that the scriptures say that he had almost
become absent. He would come and nobody would take note of him. He would
pass and nobody would become aware that he had passed. He was a very
silent breeze...</p><p><br></p><p>Ordinarily you want to be noticed. If you are not noticed, you feel
hurt. You want attention. WHO wants attention? Attention is the
requirement of the ego, the ego feeds on it. So if attention is not
given to you – if you come and nobody notices you, you pass and nobody
says, “Good morning. How are you?” as if you had not passed – you will
feel wounded. You will start thinking, “So, I am thought to be a nobody,
and I will show these people who I am.”</p><p><br></p><p>The ego always hankers for attention.</p><p><br></p><p>... Subhuti was so silent. his desire for attention had disappeared.
And the moment desire for attention disappears, all politics disappears
from your being. Then you are religious. Then you are perfectly at home
with your nobodiness. Then you live a totally different life. Then you
live so silently that you don’t make any fuss, that you don’t make any
ripples, that you come and you go as if you had never come and you had
never gone. He was, and yet he was not...</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, the moment you REALLY are, you drop all ideas of your ego.
People carry the idea of the ego because they are not. Try to understand
this paradox. Those who are not, they brag about themselves. They HAVE
to brag, they have to prove to the world, they are constantly
performing. They know if they don’t perform they are nobodies. They have
to perform, they have to shout, they have to make noise, they have to
force others to take note of them. Adolf Hitlers and Genghis Khans and
Tamburlaines and all the stupid lot of politicians down the ages – all
that they have been doing is to make more and more people take note of
them. These are the people who are not.</p><p><br></p><p>The people who are are so contented with their being; who cares
whether anybody takes note or not? They are so much to themselves,
enough unto themselves.</p><p><br></p><p>So this is the paradox: the man who is not tries, pretends that he is
much, somebody special, and the man who is pretends not, brags not,
becomes a very silent existence.</p><p><br></p><p>... He existed as an absence...</p><p><br></p><p>And only in absence does real presence arise; the person disappears
but presence arises.</p><p><br></p><p>... He had melted slowly and disappeared as a person...</p><p><br></p><p>And when that happens, when that miracle happens, the very absence
becomes a radiant presence.</p><p><br></p><p>... Subhuti was also sitting under a tree, not even meditating.
Others were meditating, he was simply sitting there doing nothing. That
is the HIGHEST form of meditation...</p><p><br></p><p>To DO meditation is to be just a beginner. The beginner has to DO the
meditation. But one who has understood meditation cannot even think in
terms of doing, because the moment you do something you are stirred. The
moment you do something you are tense. The moment you do something
the</p><p>ego enters again from the back door – because with the doing comes
the doer. Meditation is a state of non-doing. Certainly in the beginning
one has to do, but slowly slowly as meditation deepens, understanding
arises, doing disappears. Then meditation is being, not doing.</p><p><br></p><p>Doing is part of the world of having. Doing is another aspect of
having. You have to do if you want to have; if you want to have you will
have to do. And millions of people remain in the world of doing and
having.</p><p><br></p><p>Beyond these two there is another world: the world of being – where
you don’t have anything and you are not a doer either. All is utterly
silent, all is absolutely passive, not even a ripple.</p><p><br></p><p>... So he was not doing meditation, remember. He was just sitting and
doing nothing. And then suddenly, flowers began to fall around him. And
those were not ordinary flowers, not of this world, not earthly. They
were not falling from the trees, they were falling from the sky, from
nowhere, out of the blue. He had never seen such beauty and such
freshness and such fragrance. Those were the flowers of the beyond,
Golden Flowers. He was naturally in awe and wonder. And then he heard
the gods whispering to him, “We are praising you for your discourse on
emptiness<span class=s4></span>” Now he was</p><p>really puzzled. “Discourse on emptiness? But I have not spoken of
emptiness,” said Subhuti.</p><p><br></p><p>“You have not spoken of emptiness, we have not heard emptiness,”
responded the gods. “This is true emptiness.”</p><p><br></p><p>And blossoms showered upon Subhuti like rain.</p><p><br></p><p>This is one of the most beautiful stories I have ever come across. A
great meaning is hidden there: if you are silent, if you are utterly
silent, existence starts showering on you. Blessings shower on you like
rain. If you are silent, if you are in the state of meditation, just
being and doing nothing, the whole existence converges upon you with all
its grace, with all its beauty and benediction.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the state Jesus calls the state of beatitude. For the first
time you become aware of the splendor of existence. Each moment is an
eternity then, and even to breathe is such a joy, such a celebration.
Misery disappears the moment you disappear; misery is the shadow of the
ego. And blessing is a natural phenomenon: it happens on its own the
moment you are empty. The whole existence rushes in, explodes.</p><p><br></p><p>Ludwig Wittgenstein has said, “The mystical is not the ‘how’ of the
world, but that it exists.”</p><p><br></p><p>Just that it exists is the mystery. There is no need to go anywhere
else: the mystery is not hidden, the mystery is all over the place. Just
that it exists is the mystery of it! You need not dig deep to find the
mystery. Mystery is everywhere, on the surface as much as in the depth.
All that is needed is a heart that feels. All that is needed is a being
that is available, open. All that is needed is alertness, alertness
without any effort and tension. All that is needed is a state of
meditation, and then favors from existence start showering like
rain.</p><p><br></p><p>The sutras:</p><p><br></p><p>Master Lu-tsu said: NOW THERE ARE THREE CONFIRMATORY EXPERIENCES
WHICH CAN BE TESTED. THE FIRST IS THAT, WHEN ONE HAS ENTERED THE STATE
OF MEDITATION,</p><p>THE GODS ARE IN THE VALLEY. MEN ARE HEARD TALKING AS THOUGH AT A
DISTANCE OF SEVERAL HUNDRED PACES, EACH ONE QUITE CLEAR. BUT THE SOUNDS
ARE ALL LIKE AN ECHO IN A VALLEY: ONE CAN ALWAYS HEAR THEM, BUT NEVER
ONESELF. THIS IS CALLED: ‘THE PRESENCE OF THE GODS IN THE VALLEY.’</p><p><br></p><p>Lu-tsu is talking about three confirmatory signs. The first he calls
‘the gods are in the valley’. Those who are moving – and you all are
moving towards meditation – are going to come across these strange but
tremendously beautiful spaces. The first sign that meditation has
started becoming a crystallized phenomenon in you is ‘the presence of
the gods in the valley’.</p><p><br></p><p>What does this metaphor mean? It means the moment meditation starts
happening in you, the whole existence becomes a valley and you are at
the top of a hill. You start rising upwards. The whole world becomes a
valley, far away, deep down there, and you are sitting on a sunlit
hilltop. Meditation takes you upwards – not physically, but spiritually.
And the phenomenon is very clear when it happens; these will be the
signs.</p><p><br></p><p>When you are moving inwards in the meditation, suddenly you will see
a great distance arising between you and the noises around you. You may
be sitting in a marketplace and suddenly you will see a gap is arising
between you and the noises. Just a moment before those noises were
almost identified with you, you were in them; now you are getting away
from them. You are there physically, as you had been before; there is no
need to go to the mountains – this is the way to find the real mountains
of the within, this is the way to find the Himalayas within. You start
moving into deep silence, and suddenly all the noises that were so close
to you – and such a turmoil was there – start going far away, receding
backwards. Everything is as it was before on the outside, nothing has
been changed; you are sitting in the same place where you had started
meditating. But as meditation deepens this will be felt: you will feel
distance arising from outside things.</p><p><br></p><p>MEN ARE HEARD TALKING AS THOUGH AT A DISTANCE OF SEVERAL HUNDRED
PACES...</p><p><br></p><p>... As if suddenly the world has gone away from you or you have gone
away from the world. But each thought is quite clear. Whatsoever is
being said outside is quite clear, in fact, more clear than it was
before.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the magic of meditation. You are not becoming unconscious,
because in unconsciousness also you will see that noises are
disappearing. For example, if you have been given chloroform you will
feel this same phenomenon happening: noises start going away, away,
away... and they are gone – but you have fallen unconscious. You cannot
hear anything clearly.</p><p><br></p><p>Just the same happens in meditation, but with a difference – the
noises start going away from you, but every noise becomes distinctly
clear, more clear than it was before, because now a witnessing is
arising.</p><p><br></p><p>First you were also a noise in all the noises; you were lost in it.
Now you are a witness, an observer, and because you are so silent you
can see everything distinctly, clearly. Although noises are far away,
they are more clear than ever before. Each single note is heard.</p><p><br></p><p>If in meditation you are listening to music this will happen: first
you will see the music is going far away; and the second thing,
simultaneously will also be felt: each note is becoming so clear and
so</p><p>distinct as it had never been before. Before, those notes were mixed
with each other, overlapping into each other. Now they are all clearcut
individuals, atomic. Each single note is separate.</p><p><br></p><p>MEN ARE HEARD TALKING AS THOUGH AT A DISTANCE OF SEVERAL HUNDRED
PACES, EACH ONE QUITE CLEAR, BUT THE SOUNDS ARE ALL LIKE AN ECHO IN A
VALLEY.</p><p><br></p><p>And the third thing will be felt: that they are not heard directly
but as if indirectly, as if they are echoes of the real sounds, not the
sounds themselves. They become more insubstantial, their substance is
lost. They become less material, their matter disappears; they are no
more heavy, they are light. You can see their weightlessness – they are
like echoes. The whole existence becomes an echo.</p><p><br></p><p>That is why Hindu mystics call the world MAYA, illusion. Illusion
does not mean unreal; it simply means shadow-like, echo-like. It does
not mean non-existential, it simply means dream-like. Shadow-like,
dream-like, echo-like – that will be the feeling. You cannot feel that
these things are real. The whole existence becomes a dream, very clear,
distinct, because you are alert; and very dream-like because you are
alert. First you were lost in the dream: you were not alert, and you
were thinking that this is reality. You were identified with your mind.
Now you are no more identified with the mind, a separate entity has
arisen in you: the watchfulness, SAKSHI.</p><p><br></p><p>ONE CAN ALWAYS HEAR THEM, BUT NEVER ONESELF.</p><p><br></p><p>And the fourth thing in it will be felt: you can hear the whole
existence around you – people talking, walking, children laughing,
somebody crying, a bird call, a car passes by, an aeroplane, the train.
You will be able to hear everything. Just one thing: you will not be
able to hear yourself, you have completely disappeared. You are an
emptiness, you are becoming a Subhuti. You are just not there at all.
You cannot feel yourself as an entity. All the noises are there, just
your inner noises have disappeared. Ordinarily there are more noises
inside you than on the outside. The real turmoil is within you, the real
madness is there. And when the outer madness and inner madness both meet
together, hell is created.</p><p><br></p><p>The outer madness is going to continue, because you have not produced
it and you cannot destroy it, but you can destroy your inner madness
very easily. It is within your capacity. Once the inner is not there the
outer madness becomes insubstantial. It loses all reality, it becomes
illusory. You cannot find your old voice; there is no thought arising in
you, so no sound. This is called ‘the gods are in the valley’.</p><p><br></p><p>You have become empty, and everything has gone deep down in the
valley; only echoes are heard. And when echoes are heard, certainly you
are not affected.</p><p><br></p><p>Just the other day a madman tried to rape Anuradha. He was caught
before he could do any harm. I asked Anuradha to come to me just to see
whether she’s affected by it or not. And I was tremendously happy that
she is not affected at all, not at all, not even a trace. That’s the
beauty of growing meditation: even if you are murdered you will remain
unaffected.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, the effort to rape her was murderous. And let Morarji Desai know
that this is the true image of his India; an Indian tried it. And this
is not a single case, it has been happening almost regularly. It has
become so dangerous for my sannyasins to move outside. This ugly India
is not my India. This</p><p>ugly India belongs to Moraji Desai and Charan Singh and Advani and
company. I simply disown this ugly India.</p><p><br></p><p>But there is another India: the India of the Buddhas, the eternal
India. I am part of it, you are part of it. In fact, anywhere, wherever
meditation is happening, that person becomes part of that eternal India.
That eternal India is not geographical, it is a spiritual space. And to
become part of that eternal India is to become a sannyasin.</p><p><br></p><p>And I was happy, tremendously happy, seeing Anuradha: she had
remained absolutely unaffected, not a ripple of fear, nothing – as if
nothing had happened, as if the attempt was made in a dream.</p><p><br></p><p>This is how one grows slowly slowly into meditation. All becomes
insubstantial. One can see everything.</p><p><br></p><p>She fought back. She was courageous and brave, she did whatsoever was
needed to be done, she didn’t yield – but the inner consciousness
remained unaffected.</p><p><br></p><p>THIS IS CALLED THE PRESENCE OF THE GODS IN THE VALLEY. AT TIMES THE
FOLLOWING CAN BE EXPERIENCED: AS SOON AS ONE IS QUIET THE LIGHT OF THE
EYES BEGINS TO BLAZE UP, SO THAT EVERYTHING BEFORE ONE BECOMES QUITE
BRIGHT AS IF ONE WERE IN A CLOUD. IF ONE OPENS ONE’S EYES AND SEEKS THE
BODY, IT IS NOT TO BE FOUND ANY MORE. THIS IS CALLED: ‘IN THE EMPTY
CHAMBER IT GROWS LIGHT’. INSIDE AND OUTSIDE, EVERYTHING IS EQUALLY
LIGHT. THAT IS A VERY FAVORABLE SIGN.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, the second sign is called: ‘In the empty chamber it grows
light’.</p><p><br></p><p>Unless you become empty, you will remain dark, you will remain
darkness. ‘In the empty chamber it grows light’: when you are utterly
empty, when there is nobody inside you, then light happens. The presence
of the ego creates darkness. Darkness and ego are synonymous. No-ego and
light are synonymous.</p><p><br></p><p>So ALL methods of meditations, whatsoever their orientation, finally
verge in this empty chamber of your inner being. Just a silent space is
left, and in that space you find great light arising, without any
source. It is not like the light that you see when the sun rises,
because the light that comes from the sun cannot be eternal; in the
night it will disappear again. It is not like the light that needs fuel,
because when the fuel is finished the light will disappear.</p><p><br></p><p>This light has a very mysterious quality: it has no source, no cause.
It is not caused, hence once it appears it remains, it never disappears.
In fact, it is already there; you are just not empty enough to see
it.</p><p><br></p><p>And when this light starts growing in you these will be the
experiences, ‘as soon as one is quiet’. The moment you sit silently and
you become quiet, still, unmoving within and without, ‘the light of the
eyes begins to blaze up’.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly you will see your light is pouring through your eyes. This
is an experience that science has not yet become aware of. Science
thinks that light gets into the eyes, but never otherwise. Light</p><p>comes from the outside, gets into the eyes, enters you: this is only
half the story. The other half is known only by the mystics and the
meditators. This is only one part: the light entering you. There is
another part: the light pouring out of your eyes. And when the light
starts pouring out of your eyes, ‘the light of the eyes begins to blaze
up, so that everything before one becomes quite bright’.</p><p><br></p><p>Then this whole existence brightens up. Then you see that trees are
more green than ever, and their greenness has a quality of luminosity in
it. Then you see the roses are rosier than ever. The same roses, the
same trees, but something from you is pouring into them, revealing them
more clearly than ever. Then small things have such beauty: just colored
stones are more beautiful to a Buddha than the Kohinoor diamond to Queen
Elizabeth. To Queen Elizabeth, even the Kohinoor – the greatest diamond
in the world – is not so beautiful as an ordinary stone is to a Buddha.
Why? – because Buddha’s eyes can pour light, and in that light ordinary
stones become Kohinoors. Ordinary people become Buddhas. To a Buddha,
everything is full of Buddhahood. Hence he has said, “The day I became
enlightened, the whole existence became enlightened. The trees and the
mountains and the rivers and the rocks – all became enlightened.” The
whole existence was raised to a higher plenitude.</p><p><br></p><p>It depends on you how much you can put into existence; only that much
will you get. If you don’t put anything into it you won’t get anything
out of it. First you have to put into it to get out of it. That’s why
creative people know more beauty, more love, more joy than uncreative
people – because creative people put something into existence. Existence
responds... and responds generously.</p><p><br></p><p>Your eyes are empty: they don’t give anything, they only take. They
are hoarders, they don’t share. So whenever you will come across eyes
which can share, you will see a tremendously different quality, a
tremendous beauty, silence, power, potential. If you can see those eyes
which can pour their light into you, your whole heart will be
stirred.</p><p><br></p><p>But even to see that light you will have to be a little more alert
than you are. The sun may be rising and it may be morning, but you may
be fast asleep. But then no sun is rising for you, and there is no
morning; you may be lost in a dark night, in a nightmare. You have to be
a little more wakeful, but this happens.</p><p><br></p><p>In the modern consciousness an experience of this kind has come
through psychedelics, a little bit. It is forced, it is violent. It is
not natural, you are raping your chemistry. But the experience has
happened, and many people have come to meditation through drugs because
the drug has made them aware of something they were never aware of.</p><p><br></p><p>When you have taken some drug, the world looks more beautiful.
Ordinary things look extraordinary. What is happening? The drug is
forcing some inner light from your eyes to fall onto things – but it is
a forced phenomenon, and dangerous. And after each drug-trip you will
fall into a deeper darkness than before. And in the person who has been
taking drugs long, you will find his eyes UTTERLY empty because he has
been pouring light out of his eyes and he does not know how to create
it. He does not know how to make his inner light circulate so that more
light is created; he simply pours. So a man who takes drugs, by and by,
loses the vitality of his eyes, the youth of his eyes. His eyes become
dull, dark, black holes.</p><p><br></p><p>Just the opposite happens through meditation: the more quiet you
become, the more light is created – and it is not a forced phenomenon.
You have so much that it starts overflowing from your eyes. It</p><p>simply starts overflowing. Because you have too much it has to be
shared, like when the cloud is full of rain it has to rain. You are full
of light and more light is coming in, streaming in every moment, and
there is no end to it – now you can share. You can share with the trees
and with the rocks and with people. You can give to the existence. This
is a very favorable sign.</p><p><br></p><p>But don’t be deceived by drugs. Drugs give you only false
experiences, forced experiences, and any forced experience is
destructive to your inner ecology, your inner harmony and finally you
will be a loser, not a gainer.</p><p><br></p><p>AT TIMES THE FOLLOWING CAN BE EXPERIENCED: AS SOON AS ONE IS QUIET,
THE LIGHT OF THE EYES BEGINS TO BLAZE UP.</p><p><br></p><p>You will see it! Your eyes are becoming aflame. And with the eyes
becoming aflame the whole existence is taking a new color, a new depth,
a new dimension, as if things are no more three- dimensional but
four-dimensional. A new dimension is added: the dimension of
luminosity.</p><p><br></p><p>... THE LIGHT OF THE EYES BEGINS TO BLAZE UP, SO THAT EVERYTHING
BEFORE ONE BECOMES QUITE BRIGHT, AS IF ONE WERE IN A CLOUD...</p><p><br></p><p>... as if the sun is shining on the cloud and the whole cloud is
afire, and you are in the cloud and the cloud is just fire reflecting
the sun. One starts living in this cloud of light. One sleeps in it, one
walks in it, one sits in it; this cloud continues. This cloud has been
seen as the aura. Those who have eyes to see will see around the head of
the saints, around their bodies, a light. A subtle aura surrounds
them.</p><p><br></p><p>Now even science is agreeing with it, particularly in Russia. Kirlian
photography has come to very significant conclusions. One of them is:
that everything is surrounded by a subtle aura – we just need eyes to
see – and in different states the aura changes. Now these are scientific
conclusions. When you are ill you have a different aura – dull, sad,
lusterless. If you are going to die within six months your aura
disappears. Then your body has no light around it. And if you are happy,
joyous, fulfilled, contented, then the aura grows more and more big,
becomes more and more bright.</p><p><br></p><p>Of course Kirlian experiments have not been done on any Buddha yet.
And it is very difficult to find a Bud&amp;a in Soviet Russia,
particularly now. It is unfortunate, because the whole country has
fallen into a trap of utter nonsense. The whole country has fallen into
the trap of materialism. Never before has any country been ruled by
materialists. Materialism has always persisted, but never has a country
been ruled by materialists. Never has a country been conditioned to be
materialistic like Soviet Russia. Children are taught there is no God,
no soul, that man is just a body. There is no question of prayer, no
question of meditation, no question of becoming silent.</p><p><br></p><p>If Kirlian photographers come across a man like Jesus or Buddha or
Subhuti, then they will know the miracle. Then they will come across the
purest light, the coolest light – which is light, which is life, which
is love.</p><p><br></p><p>IF ONE OPENS ONE’S EYES AND SEEKS THE BODY...</p><p><br></p><p>In this moment, when you are full of light inside and your eyes are
afire and the whole existence is aflame with new life, if you open your
eyes and try to find your body, you will not find it. In</p><p>these moments matter disappears. In fact, modern physics says that
there is no matter at all; it is an illusion. There is nothing solid in
your body. Deep down, modern physics says, your body is constituted of
electrons. Electrons mean light-atoms, atoms of light. So when this
inner fire burns bright, is REALLY there, and you open your eyes, you
will not find your physical body. Not that it is not there; it is there,
but you will not see it as you had seen it before. It will be just a
cloud of light. You will see the aura; the gestalt has changed. Now you
will see something which you had never seen before, and ali that you had
seen before has disappeared; it depends on your vision. Because you
don’t have a vision to see the spirit, you can only see the body, the
physical. To see matter, nothing is needed – no intelligence, no
meditativeness, no prayer. To see matter is very gross. To see spirit is
very subtle.</p><p>Once you are capable of seeing the spirit, you will be able to see
that matter has disappeared. You cannot see both together. Again let me
repeat: that’s why Hindu mystics have called the world illusory, because
they have come to a point when they have seen that matter does not
exist. And all that exists is God, all that exists is consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>Matter is just a mistake. You have not seen rightly; that’s how
matter arises. It IS consciousness. For example, when I see you I see
you as consciousness, not as matter. When I touch you I don’t touch your
body, I touch you in your innermost core, I touch your energy. When I
look into your eyes I’m not looking into your physical eyes, I’m trying
to contact your spiritual eye. It is there. To you, it is not there yet.
For me, it is already there. And if you listen to me, and if you try to
understand what is being shared with you, soon it will become a reality
for you too.</p><p><br></p><p>Either God is or the world is; both are never found together. Those
who see the world never see God, and those who have seen God, for them
the world has disappeared. The ‘world’ was just a misunderstanding. It
is just like you can commit a mistake while counting or doing
arithmetic: two plus two, and you can put five; then the whole thing
will go wrong. When you go back and you find the mistake and yOu correct
it and two plus two becomes four again, the whole thing changes. Exactly
like this, matter is a mistake of vision.</p><p><br></p><p>It is just like Hindu mystics say: it is a rope seen in darkness, and
you have thought it is a snake. And because you thought it is a snake
you start running. And your heart is pounding, and you are out of
breath, and you are trembling, and it is a cool night but you are
perspiring. You may even have a heart attack, and for no reason at all!
And in the morning, when it is found to have been just a rope, it will
look very ridiculous.</p><p><br></p><p>Once I was staying in a house with a friend. There were so many mice
in the house, and rats. It happened that night that a rat must have
entered into the bed of my friend when we were asleep. The rat was just
going to bite, just going to bite his foot, and he was awakened. He
jumped out of the bed, screamed; the rat must have escaped. Nothing was
harmed – he was just going to bite – but he became very much afraid. He
was afraid that maybe it was a snake. And I said, “You are a fool! There
is no snake, nothing” – and we looked around – “and we know that there
are so many rats in your house. It must have been a rat.” So he was
satisfied; we went to sleep. Everything was perfectly good.</p><p>We went to the river, we swam in the river, we came back. After lunch
a snake was found in the house, and immediately my friend became
unconscious – the very idea! And I tried hard, but now he was already
unconscious, so what to do?</p><p>For one and a half hours he remained unconscious, in a kind of coma.
Doctors were called, they checked. They said, “There is no poison,
nothing. Even the rat has not done any harm, and there is no question of
any snake.” But still injections were given to bring him back. Just the
idea... but the idea can create a reality.</p><p><br></p><p>When you see a rope and you start running, your running is a reality,
and your heart pounding is a reality. And you may have a heart attack,
you may even die – this is a reality! But the snake was not there; that
was just an idea.</p><p><br></p><p>The mystics say the world is just an idea. You are unnecessarily
afraid, unnecessarily running away, unnecessarily worried – it is just
an idea, a mistake. There is no world, there is only God.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole consists only of consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>IF ONE OPENS ONE’S EYES AND SEEKS THE BODY, IT IS NOT TO BE FOUND ANY
MORE. THIS IS CALLED: ‘IN THE EMPTY CHAMBER IT GROWS LIGHT’. INSIDE AND
OUTSIDE, EVERYTHING IS EQUALLY LIGHT. THAT IS A VERY FAVORABLE SIGN.</p><p><br></p><p>These have to be understood because these are going to happen to you
too, and the understanding will help. Otherwise one day you open your
eyes and you don’t find your body there, you may go crazy. You will
certainly feel something has gone wrong: either you are dead or mad. And
what has happened to the body? But if you understand these sutras, they
will remind you in the right moment. That’s why I am talking on so many
scriptures: to make you aware of all that is possible, so when it
happens you are not taken aback. You know, you can understand, you have
maps already. You can figure out where you are and you can rest in that
understanding.</p><p><br></p><p>OR WHEN ONE SITS IN MEDITATION, THE FLESHLY BODY BECOMES QUITE
SHINING LIKE SILK OR JADE. IT SEEMS DIFFICULT TO REMAIN SITTING; ONE
FEELS AS IS DRAWN UPWARD. THIS IS CALLED: ‘THE SPIRIT RETURNS AND
TOUCHES HEAVEN’. IN TIME, ONE CAN EXPERIENCE IT IN SUCH A WAY THAT ONE
REALLY FLOATS UPWARD.</p><p><br></p><p>The third sign: ‘The spirit returns and touches heaven’.</p><p><br></p><p>This happens very soon; it starts happening in the very early stages.
Sitting silently, suddenly you feel you are a little higher than the
ground, maybe six inches higher. With great surprise you open your eyes
and you find you are sitting on the ground, so you must have been
dreaming, you think.</p><p><br></p><p>No, you have not been dreaming, your physical body remained on the
earth. But you have another body, the body of light hidden inside it –
call it the astral body, the subtle body, the vital body, any name you
want – that body starts rising higher. And from the inside you can feel
only that body, because that is your inside. When you open your eyes
your material body is sitting on the ground perfectly, in the same way
as it was sitting before. Don’t think that you have been hallucinating,
not at all. It is a real fact: you had floated a little – but in your
second body not in your first body.</p><p><br></p><p>THE FLESHLY BODY BECOMES QUITE SHINING LIKE SILK OR JADE.</p><p><br></p><p>And simultaneously, whenever you will feel that you have risen above
the ground – as if gravitation affects you no more, as if a different
law has started working on you.<span class=s4></span>I call that law
’the law of</p><p>grace’. One law is the law of gravitation: it pulls you down. I call
the other law the law of grace; it pulls you up. And certainly, sooner
or later, science has to discover it, because every law has to be
complemented by its opposite. No law can exist in aloneness. Gravitation
must have its complementary, just as day has night and summer has winter
and man has woman and love has hate and life has death and the negative
has the positive. So, exactly in the same way, there MUST be a law which
has to compensate, complement from the other extreme. That law I call
the law of grace; it pulls you upwards.</p><p><br></p><p>This experience of your fleshly body becoming quite shining like silk
or jade, happens simultaneously whenever you start feeling that it is
DIFFICULT TO REMAIN SITTING; ONE FEELS AS IF DRAWN UPWARD. THIS IS
CALLED: ‘THE SPIRIT RETURNS AND TOUCHES HEAVEN’.</p><p><br></p><p>Now the upward journey is starting. And remember, the upward and
inward are synonymous; outward and downward are synonymous. The more in
you go, the more up you go. The deeper you reach upwards, the deeper you
reach inwards. They are the same, one dimension, two aspects of the same
dimension.</p><p><br></p><p>IN TIME, ONE CAN EXPERIENCE IT IN SUCH A WAY THAT ONE REALLY FLOATS
UPWARD.</p><p><br></p><p>And that too happens: when this inner body starts rising so high and
has tremendous power, then even the physical body can start floating
with it. It is possible, but there is no need to make it happen. That is
foolish. If it happens one day of its own accord, enjoy it and don’t
take much note of it. These confirmatory signs have to be understood,
not bragged about. Don’t talk to anybody about them, otherwise the ego
will come back and will start exploiting these experiences. And once the
ego comes, experiences will disappear. Never talk about them. If they
happen just understand them, take note of them, and forget all about
them.</p><p><br></p><p>AND NOW, IT IS ALREADY POSSIBLE TO HAVE ALL THREE OF THESE
EXPERIENCES. BUT NOT EVERYTHING CAN BE EXPRESSED.</p><p><br></p><p>These three experiences ARE possible, and even if you have
experienced them, you will not be able to express them. And whatsoever
is said here is only just symbolic, because the real experience cannot
be said. All that is said becomes a lie. Say it, and you have falsified
the truth. Truth cannot be said, but still we have to say something.
Hence these metaphors have been developed: ‘gods in the valley’, ‘in the
empty chamber it grows light’, ‘the spirit returns upwards’, or ‘the
spirit returns and touches heaven’. These are just symbols, metaphors to
indicate something, but the experience is vast!</p><p><br></p><p>DIFFERENT THINGS APPEAR TO EACH PERSON ACCORDING TO HIS
DISPOSITION.</p><p><br></p><p>And this too has to be remembered: they all may not happen to you, or
may happen in a different order, or may happen in different ways. And
there are a thousand and one things too which are possible because
people are so different. To somebody these experiences may not happen
the way they have been described. For example, to somebody it may not
happen that he is rising upward; it may happen that he is becoming
bigger, becoming bigger and bigger; the whole room is full of him. And
then he goes on becoming bigger and bigger; now the house is inside him.
And it is very puzzling. One wants to open one’s eyes and see what is
happening – “Am I going mad?” And a</p><p>moment is possible when one sees that “The whole existence is inside
me. I am not outside it. It is not outside me, it is inside me. And the
stars are moving within me.”</p><p><br></p><p>Or to somebody it may happen that he becomes smaller and smaller,
becomes a molecule, almost invisible, then an atom, and then disappears.
That is possible. Patanjali has catalogued all the experiences that are
possible. People have different dispositions, different talents,
different potentials, so to everybody they are going to happen in a
different way. These are just to indicate that things like this happen –
don’t think that you are going mad or something is going bizarre.</p><p><br></p><p>WITH THESE THINGS IT IS JUST AS IT IS WHEN ONE DRINKS WATER. ONE CAN
TELL FOR ONESELF WHETHER THE WATER IS WARM OR COLD.</p><p><br></p><p>It is an experience. When you drink water, only you know whether it
is cold or warm. And if you are thirsty, only you know whether it is
quenching your thirst or creating more. Nobody else sitting outside
watching you can know what is happening inside – if the thirst is
quenched or made more, if the water is cool or warm – nobody can see
from the outside. Even if they can see you drinking water, they cannot
experience your experience. People can see you meditating, but they
cannot see what is happening inside.</p><p><br></p><p>Many people come here and they ask me for permission to watch people
meditating. And I say, “How will you watch?” Nobody has ever been able
to watch. You can see people sitting or dancing or singing, but that is
not the real thing. Meditation is happening inside them. Nobody can see
except them. So if you really want to see, you will have to participate.
You will have to become a meditator; that is the only way. You cannot
borrow, nobody can inform you. So those who come here as spectators just
waste their time. These are things which can be known only through
participation.</p><p><br></p><p>IN THE SAME WAY A MAN MUST CONVINCE HIMSELF ABOUT THESE EXPERIENCES,
THEN ONLY ARE THEY REAL.</p><p><br></p><p>And don’t start believing because Lu-tsu is saying so. Just try to
understand him, keep it stored in your memory. There is no need to
believe in these things, no need to disbelieve either. Just let them be
in your memory so whenever the time is ripe and something starts
happening you will be able to understand. These are just giving you maps
so you are not lost – because even in the inward journey there are many
points from where one can be lost. One can misunderstand, one can become
afraid, frightened. One can escape from the inside into the outside
world.</p><p><br></p><p>And these experiences are NOT frightening, but your interpretation
can make them frightening. Just think: one day you open your eyes and
you don’t see your body. Your interpretation can be frightening: “This
is certainly a sign of madness.” You will stop meditating, you will
become afraid of meditation, because who knows now what will happen next
time, and where you are moving, where you are going. You will become
suspicious of the whole experience. You will think you are becoming
neurotic.</p><p><br></p><p>Every day people come to me with their experiences. When they relate
their experiences, I can see their fear, their faces, their eyes – they
are afraid. When I say that these are good signs, immediately the
climate changes. They start laughing, they are happy. If they can hear
me saying that “This is beautiful”, that “I am happy with you” that “You
are growing well”, IMMEDIATELY there is a great</p><p>change. From sadness they jump to great joy. Nothing has changed,
their experience is the same; I have just given them a different
interpretation. They were frightened because they knew not.</p><p><br></p><p>These things have not to be believed or disbelieved, but just kept
stored in the memory so if the time arises you will be able to interpret
rightly – and right interpretations are of GREAT significance. Otherwise
the inner journey becomes very difficult. There are many points from
where one wants to return and go back into the world and be normal.</p><p><br></p><p>One starts feeling something abnormal is happening, and ‘abnormal’ is
a condemnatory word. And if you talk to other people who have never
meditated they will say, “You go to the psychoanalyst or the
psychiatrist. Better that you be checked. What nonsense are you talking?
– that you become bigger! Have you lost all reason? You say that you go
upward and gravitation disappears? Or you become smaller and smaller and
you disappear? You are hallucinating, you have become a victim of
illusions. You go to the psychiatrist – he will put you right, he will
fix you.”</p><p><br></p><p>And if you go to the psychoanalyst or the psychiatrist, they ARE
going to fix you: they will hammer on your head with their so-called
knowledge. They don’t know a thing about meditation, meditation has not
entered in their consciousness yet. They don’t know anything about the
experiences that happen on the Way, but they know much about mad people.
And there is one thing to be taken note of: that there are many
experiences which are similar, which happen to a meditator and also
happen to a madman; which are so similar that the psychiatrist is BOUND
to think that you are going nuts, that something has to be fixed in you.
And he will treat you as a madman – he will give you drugs or injections
or electro-shocks to bring you back to your normal mind. He may destroy
your whole possibility for meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>This is now a great danger in the West: people learning meditation go
back to the West, and if something happens which is not within their
comprehension, and they talk to the priest – and the Christian priest
knows nothing about meditation – he will send them to the psychiatrist.
If they talk to the psychiatrist, he knows only about madmen, he knows
nothing about Buddhas. And a few of their experiences are similar; he is
bound to interpret that you have fallen below normality, you have to be
pulled back. And whatsoever he will do will be destructive, will be
harmful to your body, to your mind. The harm carl be so much that never
again will you be able to go into meditation – he can create SUCH
barriers.</p><p><br></p><p>So if something happens sometimes, always go to people who meditate.
That’s why I am insisting so much to open centers all over the world so
sannyasins can meditate, and if something happens they can meet
sannyasins, they can go and share their experiences. At least there will
be somebody sympathetic. At least there will be somebody who will not
condemn you, who will respect your experience, who will accept your
experience, who will give you hope and inspiration, who will say, “Good.
you go ahead. Much more is going to happen.” A Master is needed only
because of this – somebody whom you can trust and who’s simply saying
“It is good, and you can go ahead”, and you CAN go ahead. The journey is
hazardous.</p><p><br></p><p>Master Lu-tsu said: WHEN THERE IS A GRADUAL SUCCESS IN PRODUCING THE
CIRCULATION OF THE LIGHT, A MAN MUST NOT GIVE UP HIS ORDINARY OCCUPATION
IN DOING IT.</p><p>That’s my insistence too: that a sannyasin should not renounce the
world. Your meditation SHOULD grow in the world. It should be part of
the day-to-day existence. You should not become an escapist. Why?</p><p><br></p><p>THE ANCIENTS SAID, ’WHEN OCCUPATIONS COME TO US, WE MUST ACCEPT THEM;
WHEN THINGS COME TO US, WE MUST UNDERSTAND THEM FROM THE GROUND UP. IF
THE OCCUPATIONS ARE PROPERLY HANDLED BY CORRECT THOUGHTS, THE LIGHT IS
NOT SCATTERED BY OUTSIDE THINGS, BUT CIRCULATES ACCORDING TO ITS OWN
LAW. EVEN THE STILL INVISIBLE CIRCULATION OF THE LIGHT GETS STARTED THIS
WAY; HOW MUCH MORE, THEN, IS IT THE CASE WITH THE TRUE CIRCULATION OF
THE LIGHT WHICH HAS ALREADY MANIFESTED ITSELF CLEARLY.</p><p><br></p><p>First, whatsoever situation you are in is a God-given situation;
don’t reject it. It is an opportunity, an occasion to grow. If you
escape from the opportunity, you will not grow. The people who go to the
Himalayan caves and start living there and become very much attached to
the caves remain ungrownup. They remain childish. They have not become
seasoned. If you bring them to the world they will be shattered, they
will not be able to bear it.</p><p><br></p><p>Just a few days ago one sannyasin came after three months of living
in the Himalayas, and she said, “But now it is difficult to be here. I
want to go back.” Now this is not gaining in maturity. Now the Himalayas
will become her obsession, and whatsoever she is thinking is her
meditation, her silence, is not hers; it is just a by-product of the
Himalayan silence. I told her, “You be here for three weeks, and then
you tell me what happens to your silence and your meditation. If it
disappears, then it has nothing to do with you. And then it is better
not to go to the Himalayas. Grow in meditation here! If you can be
meditative here in the marketplace, and then you go to the Himalayas,
your meditation will be enhanced a thousandfold. It is good as a
holiday, but don’t cling there; always come back to the world.”</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, it is good once in a while to move into the mountains, it is
beautiful, but to become addicted, to start thinking of renouncing the
world is utterly wrong – because it is in the storms of the world that
integrity arises. It is in the challenges of the world that you
crystallize.</p><p><br></p><p>Lu-tsu says, “Accept the situation you are in. It must be the right
situation for you; that’s why you are in it.” Existence cares for you.
It is given to you not without any reason. It is not accidental; NOTHING
IS accidental. Whatsoever is your need is given to you. If it were your
need to be in the Himalayas, you would have been in the Himalayas. And
when the need arises, you will find that either you go to the Himalayas
or the Himalayas come to you. It happens... when the disciple is ready,
the Master arrives. And when your inner silence is ready, God arrives.
And whatsoever is needed on the path is always supplied. Existence
cares, mothers.</p><p><br></p><p>So don’t be worried. Rather, use the opportunity. This challenging
world, this constant turmoil on the outside, has to be used. You have to
be a witness to it. Watch it. Learn how not to be affected by it. Learn
to remain unaffected, untouched by it, like a lotus leaf in water. And
then you will be grateful, because it is only by being watchful of all
the turmoil that one day suddenly, ‘the gods are in the valley’. You see
the marketplace disappearing far away, becoming an echo. This is REAL
growth.</p><p>And if you can rightly be meditative in the ordinary occupations of
life, there is nothing which cannot happen to you. The light will start
circulating; you just be watchful.</p><p><br></p><p>Meditate in the morning and then keep close to your center. Go into
the world but keep close to your center, go on remembering yourself.
Remain conscious of what you are doing.</p><p><br></p><p>WHEN IN ORDINARY LIFE ONE HAS THE ABILITY ALWAYS TO REACT TO THINGS
BY REFLEXES ONLY, WITHOUT ANY ADMIXTURE OF A THOUGHT OF OTHERS OR OF
ONESELF, THAT IS A CIRCULATION OF THE LIGHT ARISING OUT OF
CIRCUMSTANCES. THIS IS THE FIRST SECRET.</p><p><br></p><p>And when things arise, act, but don’t get identified in the act.
Remain a spectator. Do whatsoever is needful just like a reflex. Do
whatsoever is needful, but don’t become a doer, don’t get involved in
it. Do it, and be finished with it – like a reflex.</p><p><br></p><p>IF EARLY IN THE MORNING, ONE CAN RID ONESELF OF ALL ENTANGLEMENTS AND
MEDITATE FROM ONE TO TWO DOUBLE HOURS, AND THEN CAN ORIENTATE ONESELF
TOWARDS ALL ACTIVITIES AND OUTSIDE THINGS IN A PURELY OBJECTIVE REFLEX
WAY, AND IF THIS CAN BE CONTINUED WITHOUT ANY INTERRUPTION, THEN AFTER
TWO OR THREE MONTHS ALL THE PERFECTED ONES COME FROM HEAVEN AND APPROVE
SUCH BEHAVIOR.</p><p><br></p><p>Behave in an objective way. Take note of the situation, and
whatsoever is needful, do it. But don’t become attached to the doing,
don’t become worried about it, don’t think of the result. Just do the
needful and remain alert and aloof and distant and faraway in your
center, rooted there. But every early morning, orient yourself towards
the inner center so you can remember it your whole day.</p><p><br></p><p>Two times are the best. The first best time is the early morning:
orient yourself to the center so you can live on the circumference but
yet with full remembrance of the center. And the second time is before
you go to bed: orient yourself again to the center, so in your deep
sleep also – even while you are dreaming, while you are unconscious –
you can remain more and more, closer and closer to the center. These two
times are the best. And if you can meditate these two times, you need
not go anywhere else. You need not go to any monastery, to any cave, you
need not renounce the world, and one day suddenly you will see blossoms
showering on you and gods whispering in your ear.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole existence celebrates the moment when one soul arrives home.
What happened to Subhuti can happen to you. Aspire to it. It is your
birthright, it can be claimed.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part4>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

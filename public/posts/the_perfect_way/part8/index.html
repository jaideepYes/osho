I can feel the depth of your desire, of your thirst to know the truth. I see it in your eyes and feel it in every breath you take. And as your hearts throb for the attainment of truth my heart throbs as well! I am deeply touched by your thirst for knowledge. It is such a delight! It is so beautiful! There is nothing sweeter or more beautiful on earth than the desire to know the truth.\nIn this moment of joy what shall I say to you? What shall I say to you in this moment of your quest, as you await my words? It is only in moments like this that we realize how insignificant and obscure words are – just how meaningless and powerless they really are. When there is nothing particularly worth saying they are able to convey it; when there is something profound to say they are miserably inadequate. This is only natural because the realization of truth, the experience of bliss and the vision of beauty are so subtle and ethereal that no earthly form can be attributed to them. And as soon as one attempts to ascribe a form to them the experiences become dead and meaningless, and then the living experience does not come into our hands alive, it is its corpse that comes. The spirit is left behind and whatever the words refer to is no longer true.\nThen what should I say? Would it have been better not to have said anything, for you not to have heard anything at all? How nice it would have been if we had remained calm and quiet, speechless and silent, and it you could have awakened and seen something in that silence, something that truly is. In that case I would have saved myself from speaking and you from listening and yet the truth would have been conveyed because the eternal truth is within everyone. The music you are searching for resounds and every moment in the depths of your being, and the moments when you are searching for truth, even if they are silent, are transformed into prayer. Both thirsting for god and waiting silently are prayers.\nWhat man is seeking is within his own self. What you have gathered here to ask me about and to know from me is always within you. You have never lost it. Nor can you ever lose it. It is your existence, your being. I is the one treasure that can never be lost because you yourself are that treasure. But we are all looking for it, searching for the very thing that can never be lost. What a contradiction in terms!\nI remember a wonderful sermon but I do not recall when or by whom it was given.\nOne evening there was to be a very big gathering in a temple and so a large number of monks had assembled. After a long wait the speaker arrived. As he stood up to speak someone in the audience asked a question, “What is truth?” An alert and expectant silence filled the room. It was known that the speaker knew the answer and consequently every one of his words was considered to be important. But do you know what he said? He said, and very loudly, “O monks!” The silence resounded with the two words and every eye was on him. All were silent, watchful. But the speaker spoke no more. His speech was over; he had finished his sermon.\nDo you understand what he said? Had he said anything? In my view he had said everything. Whatsoever was worth saying had been covered by his two words. I too want to say the same thing. I will say the same thing. It is the only thing that deserves to be said, that something words cannot convey.\nThen what did he say? He said, “Don’t look for truth anywhere outside. Ask nobody about it. If it exists at all, it exists in you. otherwise it does not exist at all.” So when he was asked about truth he said absolutely nothing about it. He simply called to the congregation. he called to them as you would awaken someone from sleep. This is the only answer to the inquiry about truth.\nTo awaken is to attain truth. There is no other way. You are asleep and therefore you cannot see what is standing by your side, you cannot see what you really are. And in your dreams you wander far and wide in search of it, in search of something that is already there in you, in the seeker himself. You are like musk-deer wandering in search of musk.\nBut no matter how hard you try to find that which lives in you, you will not be able to find it. It cannot be attained by searching. Outside things can be attained by searching but one cannot attain one’s self with this kind of quest. The truth is not found by searching, it is found by waking up. And that is why the speaker called out to the assembly and spoke no further. And for this same reason Mahavira, Buddha, Krishna and Christ have all been calling to you. This is not speaking, but calling. This is not a sermon, but an address, a call.\nI do not intend to speak either, I intend to call. Will you hear me? Will you allow me to disturb your sleep and shatter your dreams? It may well be that your dreams are sweet and gratifying, but it is the sweet and gratifying dreams that are harmful because they will not let you wake up but make the intoxication of sleep all the more intense.\nI want you to witness the joy I am experiencing as the result of my awakening. And so I have decided to call you. I will not speak to you either, I will simply call you. Pardon me if my call disturbs your sleep and disperses the fog of your dreams. I am helpless. Without shattering your dreams nothing can be said about the truth. We are enveloped in sleep and as long as this sleep continues all our actions are useless. So long as you are asleep whatever you know is nothing but dreams.\nThe first thing to do is to awaken from this sleep. Everything else will come later. Nothing is to be done before this. Don’t attach any importance to the thoughts you think or to your actions during this sleep. Just look on them as happenings in a dream. While your own self is unknown to you it is impossible to do anything that is right, in the real sense of that word. Your knowledge, your conduct, everything is bound to be false. \u0026Your faith, your beliefs, your convictions will all be blind. Whatsoever path you follow, it will not lead to the truth. But there is no question of walking a path at present. Do you walk along a path asleep? It is only a dream about walking.\nThe ignorance of the self is the sleep I am talking about to you. It is necessary to awaken from it. In order to wake up from this sleep it is also necessary to understand the factors that stand between you as you are and this awakening. Before knowing religion you should first know what religion isn’t and also understand what you are holding on to as religion. Instead of awakening you this religion is more likely to be like a sleeping pill.\nKarl Marx called religion an opiate, a drug containing opium to put you to sleep. Religion is definitely not an opiate but what is generally mistaken for religion is. Marx was wrong to brand religion as an opiate and you too are wrong. What you have done is mistake an opiate for religion. Therefore, it is essential to know which is religion and which is the opiate.\nLet’s first consider what religion is not and then we will experience what religion is. Thinking about irreligion is enough to see what religion isn’t but for religion thought is not enough. To achieve religion you have to pass through a sadhana.\nFirst of all I want to mention one thing. If you really wish to reach some level in religion or in religious life, you must begin by not taking any belief or idea for granted. If you wish to know the truth do not hold on to any preconceived notions about it. You must approach truth in perfect calm and emptiness, and without any dogmas. Preconceived notions and biases dim and distort your vision. What you know then is not the truth but a projection of your own thinking. That way, truth does not descend in you. On the contrary, you impose yourself on truth.\nHold no theory or particular view about truth. Use your own judgment. Only then will you know what is true. Otherwise you won’t be able to get out of the web of the mind. What you know won’t be knowledge, it will be imagination.\nMan’s imagination has unlimited power and this imagination is the wall between you and the truth. If you make up your mind about God, the truth and the soul beforehand, your mind will stick to that decision and will lead you to believe that you have really known something. But as a matter of fact you have known nothing and are wandering in the realm of imagination. This is not a vision of truth but a dream.\nYou know very well that your mind has an infinite capacity for dreaming. Our desires show us things that do not exist at all. They create mirages, and then that which truly is becomes hidden and that which is not becomes apparent.\nBut you will say that dreaming only happens in sleep. It is true that dreams happen in sleep, but sleep can also be induced and in one sense you can even be asleep while you are awake. Don’t you day dream?\nSo if one continuously has a particular idea of God and, awake or asleep, fills himself with that image, he can most definitely project that image and have a direct vision of it. It is an intensified daydream. There is actually nothing in front of the eyes, but what has been nourished and nurtured behind the eyes has come up before him. This is a projection; this is how dreams are seen.\nAnd visions of truth based on preconceived ideas become possible as well – and in this very fashion. A devotee of Christ has a vision of Christ, a follower of Krishna sees Krishna and someone else’s disciples sees someone else. By no means is this the vision or realization of God or of truth. This is a projection of one’s imagination because there cannot be two truths, two gods. Truth is one and realization is one, and one who would know truth must give up his countless concepts and imaginings. I am not asking you to give up your concepts in favor of one concept in particular, I am asking you to give up all concepts. These very concepts have given birth to many creeds and dogmas, and because of this, innumerable creeds exist but there is no religion.\nTo know the truth all theories about it have to be forsaken. Only those who are in a state beyond all prejudices and partialities, in a state of total innocence and independence can know it. Where there is neither concept, nor notion, nor expectation, is where and where alone the truth can be realized. As a matter of fact, the effort to realize the truth is not the effort to realize the truth but the effort to rid ourselves of the state of dreaming.\nWhat is the realization of truth? It is simply freedom from hallucinations. This freedom is the realization of truth. Since we are lost in dreams, what is always present appears to be absent, despite its continuous presence.\nTruth exists because truth always is. it does not have to be brought from anywhere. It is ever- present. But we are not present. We are lost in the wilderness of our dreams. No, it is not the truth we have to bring to ourselves, we have to bring ourselves to the truth. It is possible, not by seeing dreams and visions about God, but by doing away with all the dreams and visions – and waking up.\nTherefore I say that the truth does not need imagination, but realization. The realization of the mind free from all imagination is the realization of the mind in a state of truth. We see the world when the mind is divided, when it is in a state of duality. We see the truth when the mind is an undivided entity, a unity.\nAll concepts and all beliefs are conjecture and therefore not gateways to the truth. They are obstacles and lead nowhere. On the contrary, they block your path. The path of truth does not lie through them but beyond them.\nPlease don’t adopt any idea or concept, or form any conviction or belief about truth, because the belief you form will become an experience. And that experience is not real but mental, imaginary. These experiences are not spiritual. All beliefs about the truth that are formed in ignorance are false. Do not think about what truth is and what it is like. All such thoughts are blind. It is like a blind man trying to imagine light. Poor thing! How can he conceive what light is! Without eyesight he cannot conceive anything about light. Whatever he may think will be fundamentally wrong. He cannot even imagine darkness accurately, let alone light. One needs eyes to see darkness as well.\nWhat can a man without eyesight do then? I would say to him, “Don’t think about light. Treat your eyes.” It isn’t thinking but treatment that can be helpful. But what do I see? I see him being given\nsermons, I see the philosophy of light being explained to him. But nobody bothers about treatment for the eyes.\nAnd what is more surprising is that those who are sermonizing on the subject of light have never seen the light themselves! They too know about light, but they have not known light. I say this because if they had known light they would have realized the futility of all sermons and would have focused their concern and sympathy on the treatment for blindness. If the eyesight is cured, light is experienced automatically. What is required for sight is always present. If there is sight, there is light.\n“Sight” and “light” are words that can lead in very different directions. Thinking about light leads to philosophy. It is the direction of thinking alone. It does not lead to experience; it is merely thought. There is a lot of walking but no destination is ever reached. There are many conclusions but none that can solve our problems. This is only natural. Even the most perfect thought about water cannot quench one’s thirst the slightest bit. The way to quench one’s thirst is quite different.\nThe path, the sadhana, is not the way of thinking, it is the treatment of sight. I have said that thinking about light is philosophy and now I want to say that vision through sight is religion. You can reach intellectual conclusions by thinking, while a sadhana gives you spiritual vision, spiritual experiences. The former is like thinking about water; the latter, like quenching one’s thirst. The former is a problem; the latter, a solution.\nI ask everyone this question: “Do you want to know light or to know about light?” and you – do you want to know truth or do you want to know about truth? Do you want to know about water or do you want to quench your thirst? Your answer to these questions will decide whether you are thirsty for knowledge or whether you just want to collect information.\nAnd don’t forget that these are opposite directions. One leads to the ultimate dissolution of the ego; the other, to its peak. One makes you innocent while the other makes you complex. Knowledge destroys the ego whereas information pumps it up and inflates it all the more. All collecting, all acquiring fills the ego, and for this reason the ego is always on the lookout for more.\nThoughts are also acquisitions, although quite subtle ones. Thought also feeds the ego. The hypocrisy you find among scholars is neither spontaneous nor accidental, it is the natural outcome of thought.\nThoughts are acquired. They crowd in from the outside world, they are not born within. They are not of the soul but they are its wall sin a way. From outside, information about light can be given to a blind man but the sensation of light has to be produced in him from within. One is acquisition and energy is the difference between information and knowledge. Acquisition comes from outside; energy, from inside.\nBut acquisition gives the illusion of energy. This illusion is quite strong and it nourishes the ego. Egoism is not energy, it is an illusion of energy. It is non-energy in fact, because one tiny spark of truth can destroy it, can evaporate it. It is for this reason that one’s true energy is entirely free of egoism.\nI hope you have been able to follow the distinction between learning and wisdom. It is imperative you understand it. False knowledge is an even greater hindrance on the path of self-realization than ignorance. False knowledge is the impression of “I know” when you really do not know . Such a false impression can easily grow out of the acquisition of others’ thoughts, from learning, from schooling. This false impression also comes out of a knowledge of the scriptures, of a knowledge of words. And because of this knowledge of words men seem to think they have realized the truth.\nWords become part of the memory. They form into questions and each question carries an automatic reply. One’s sense of discrimination is lost in and dominated by the borrowed ideas and, before a man can look for any reply from within, the thick layer of borrowed words and ideas pops out a ready-made answer. In this way we can’t work out the problem, we are robbed of its solution. If a problem is mine it is my solution alone that is required. No borrowed or secondhand solution can be of any help.\nOne can neither borrow life nor the solutions to its problems. The solution to a problem does not come from outside. It is inherent in the problem. The solution evolves out of the problem. If the problem is within, the truth cannot be outside. And the truth cannot be learned therefore. It has to be laid bare. You have to discover it. It isn’t through training but by realization alone that the truth can be known. And this is the fundamental difference between the one who has learned the scriptures and the one who has realized the soul. It is enough to be well versed in the scriptures as far as this world is concerned but not so in the realm of the spirit. In that sphere, it is far less than even the starting point.\nYou can only have information about that is not you, about the world, about the world of matter. Of these things you cannot have knowledge. Whatsoever pertains to outside can only be known from outside. You may be very close to it but it will still be far away. However tiny the distance between us might be, it will never end. It will always be there. So we can only become familiar with things that are non-us but we can never have knowledge about them. We can know about something but the something itself we cannot know.\nThe total elimination of distance is the prerequisite of all knowledge. Only then can you enter your inner being. But what is distant can never be anything but distant. It can only be otherwise if there is no distance in reality. Distance can be eliminated only if it is illusory. If it is real, its elimination is not possible.\nThere is one and only one being not distant from me. It is impossible for this being to be distant from me. I am that being. Yes, it is my own self. Of that being alone, is real knowledge possible. The distance from this being is just an illusion because how can there be any distance from oneself? I alone am the center of my self and it is here I have my inner portal, my inner abode and the abiding throne of perfection. Knowledge of this alone is possible.\nI also want to remind you of another fact: we cannot know the world, we can only make its acquaintance and gather information about it. But of the self, only knowledge is possible. So there can be no information about the self, about atman – only knowledge of the soul is possible. That is why, in the case of objects, in the case of material things, in non-us things, it is enough to be expert in the shastras, in the scriptures, but in the case of the self it is not enough.\nScience is a shastra; religion is not. Science is a shastra; religion is not. Science is information about objects while religion is knowledge of the self. Science is a shastra, a scripture; religion is a sadhana, the path to realization.\nI am not preaching a sermon. That approach is totally fruitless. What is required is not a sermon but treatment. I do not intend to expound on any doctrines pertaining to truth. They are altogether useless. However, what is of value is the method by which one can see truth. This method serves as a treatment for the illness and because of it the eyes open. Then you don’t have to think about light, you see it straightaway. When sight is absent you have to think, but when there is sight, thinking will be out of the question. In blindness, thinking does the work of the eyes, but as soon as sight is restored thinking becomes unnecessary.\nIn my viewpoint, thought is not a sign of knowledge but of ignorance. Knowledge is a state of thoughtlessness. It is not thinking, it is insight. And this insight is not possible through any dogma about truth. Dogmas merely reduce things to intellectual acquisitions and they become parts of the memory. They can never become parts of knowledge.\nDogmas can be taught but they cannot change one’s real personality. Like clothing, they effect a change on the outer level but the inner being remains what it was. The spirit remains untouched by them and the veil, the cover, takes on a new form and a new color. If you are this way, wisdom cannot descend upon you. On the contrary, you will fall into the ditch of hypocrisy.\nThere is a great gulf between a man’s being and knowledge. He is one thing and what he knows is quite another thing. His personality is split in two. There is both conflict and duality between his inner being and his outer shell. And the natural result of this is hypocrisy. Such a man begins to present himself as someone who is not really there in him, and begins to hide the one who is. This acting is irreligious. It not only ruins the lives of others but one’s own life as well. This is self-deception but it passes for being religious.\nThe intellectual teachings of dogmas, of doctrines, can only do this much: they can change the outer wrapping for a spiritual revolution some other approach is necessary. The approach should not be one of doctrine but of sadhana, of walking the path of self-realization. It is not the approach of sermons but of treatment. It is not the approach of thinking about truth but of opening the eyes to truth.\nReligion is the method of opening the eyes. If your eyes open the vision of God becomes easy. But doctrines will not open your eyes. On the contrary, those who are deluded by them forget that their eyes are closed and that the truths they discuss have not been seen by them with their own eyes but by the eyes of others. The truth seen by another is like a meal eaten by another. It has no purpose whatsoever for anyone else.\nThe realization of truth is wholly private and personal and is by no means transferable. It can neither be received nor given. It has to be attained by oneself. It cannot be stolen or accepted in charity. It is not a piece of property, it is one’s own self. Truth is not property, it is one’s own self and it is therefore non-transferable. So far no one has ever given it to anyone. Nor will anybody in the future ever be able to give it to anyone because the moment it is given it ceases to be the truth, it becomes an object. An object can be given or taken. Truth has to be attained within oneself, by oneself. It is\nsubjective. In fact, it is not really to be attained – one has to become it. It is your own being, your own existence.\nSo where does the question of learning truth come in? It must be discovered. Learning only forms layers over the self. All outside teachings only cover truth. Whatever comes from outside can only cover. Covering is the only thing possible from outside. And the garments of thought continue to cover the self more and more. Strip off these garments and be naked. Throw all these garment away. In order to know your self you have to unlearn, not learn. When all the outside guests have gone you will know the one who is not a guest, but the host.\nThe truth cannot be taught but the method of knowing truth can. Today, no one speaks of this method. Although there is a lot of talk about truth, there is no talk about the method of realizing the truth. There can be no greater mistake than this. It is clinging to the body and missing life. As a result of this there are countless religions, but no religion with a capital R.\nThe numerous sects that masquerade under the name of religions are not religion at all. There can only be one religion. There can be no adjective to describe it. It is without any qualifying term. Dharma means dharma – religion means religion. In my language you can’t say “this dharma”, “that dharma”. Where there is “this” and “that” there is no religion.\nThese sects have come into being because of the many doctrines and theories about truth and they will continue to exist as long as people demand theories and doctrines. Doctrines consist of words and sects form around these very words. The words become causes of conflict, feeding animosities and petty hates. These words divide man from man. and how strange it is! The people believe that the very words that divide man from man will unite man with God! That which divides man from man cannot possibly unite him with God, with truth, nor with his self.\nThis splitting up of religion into sects can be traced to various doctrines, to words, to beliefs, to opinions. All of this is based on ignorance and not on knowledge. Truth has no sect. All sects evolve out of doctrines. As soon as a man knows the truth he is free from sects and at that very moment he enters religion – a religion that is neither Hindu nor Jain, Christian nor Mohammedan, but simply religion – unqualified, nothing but light, nothing but consciousness. Religion is truly the realization of one’s self.\nA sect is not religious. What does organization have to do with religion? All organizations are political or social; they are all worldly. They are based on fear of one another and where there is fear there is hatred. They come into existence not out of truth, but for security. Be it a nation, a society or a sect, all are born out of fear, and the satisfaction of what is born out of fear lies in causing fear in others.\nAll sects are exactly like this. They do not intend to make anyone religious, they want to increase their numbers. Numbers are power and guarantees of security. They are both self-protection and the capacity to attack. Sects have been like this all along. They are still like this and will continue to be the same. They haven’t united man and religion, they’ve torn him away from it.\nDharma, religion, is not a social phenomenon, it is purely and simply the most personal transformation. It has nothing to do with others; it is concerned with one’s own self alone. It isn’t\nconcerned with what a man does with others but what he does with himself. Dharma is concerned with how you behave with yourself in your total isolation and loneliness.\nWhat are you in your total isolation? That is what you must know – who you are. Only the knowledge of your being will lead you to religion. There is no other way to lead someone to religion. No temple, no mosque, no church can take me to the place where I am. You don’t have to climb any outside stairs to get there. All temples are outside. All temples are part of samsara, of the world, and you cannot reach the self through their doors. No journey in the outer world can be a pilgrimage to truth, to the holy place. That place is within, where one has the experience of religion and where the mystery, joy and beauty of life are discovered. Without these everything is miserable; everything is useless, meaningless.\nIn order to know the self you have to go inside, not outside. But all man’s senses take him outwards. They all move outside. His eyes look outwards, his hands spread outwards, his legs move outwards and even his mind reflects and echoes external phenomena. And this is why he has erected idols, images of god, and has created temples to truth. It is so his eyes can see God and his feet can make a pilgrimage to truth! We have created this self-deception ourselves; we have taken this cup of poison with our own hands. And now we waste away our lives nad spend them in stupor, brought about by this poison and self-deception.\nTo suit the convenience of our senses we have visualized religion as being outside ourselves and so have directed our sight outwards. But you have to go behind the scenes to know dharma, to know religion. Your knowledge and consciousness of the world comes through the medium of the senses. You cannot possibly know the self by the same route. It is not possible to know the one who knows, to know the one who is knowledge, like another person or an object can be known. The seer, the power to see, cannot be looked at like an ordinary object. Knowledge can neither be transferred nor degraded into an object. And the whole problem is because this simple fact has not been understood. People search for god as if he were an external object. How stupid this is! God is not to be searched for, he is hidden in the seeker himself.\nTruth is within you. It is within me. And it is not that it will be within you tomorrow, it is in you here and now, at this very moment. I am. My being itself is my truth. And whatever I see may not be the truth, it may all be a dream. I see dreams too and while I see them they seem to be true. You may all be a dream for me. It may well be that I am in a dream and you are not present here at all. But the seer cannot be false. He cannot be in a dream because if he were he would not be able to see that it is a dream. A dream cannot see a dream. Untruth cannot know untruth. Seeing a dream requires someone who is not a dream himself. Even to see untruth a true seer is necessary. Therefore I say I am the truth. Truth is my being. I don’t have to go anywhere in search of it.\nYou only have to dig out the truth from within yourself. Just as you dig out a well, you have to dig truth out. There are always a few layers of stones and earth covering the spring of water, but as soon as you remove those layers the spring is freed. In the same way your self is pressed down by layers of other things, of things that belong to non-self. You only have to break through these layers and what you have been searching for through countless past lives is attained.\nSo far you have been unable to attain the truth because you have been searching for it far and wide, while as a matter of fact it has always been very near. It is really the one who is searching. You must\ndig out the well of your soul. And meditation is the means to that end. With the spade of meditation you have to remove the layers of earth, the layers of otherness that have piled up on the self. It is the only remedy, the only treatment. This is what I intend to talk about.\nFirst of all, it is necessary to know what it is that has covered up your own being, your very nature. What is it that hides you from yourself? Can’t you see it? Can’t you see what the covering is? When you go inside what do you find?\nHume has said, “whenever I have gone inside I have been unable to find anything but thoughts.” Hume did not locate any soul, nor will you find yours in this way. Hume saw only the covering layers and came back; he went only as far as the shell and returned. It is only when you break the shell open that you will see what is inside. This is just like a man who goes to a lake and seeing the surface covered with moss and leaves returns to say there is no lake at all. Generally this is what happens. We go inside every day, see the covering of thoughts and return. Thoughts always surround the self and you know nothing but thoughts. Thoughts are your world and he who lives in thoughts alone is a worldly man. To know anything beyond thought is the beginning of becoming religious. To know the state of thoughtlessness, to know what is beyond thought is to enter the domain of religion.\nIt may be that your thoughts are not about this world but are about the soul, about God, and you may be under the illusion that you are religious. I want to smash this illusion of yours. All thoughts are a covering, an outer shell. They are all desires, passions, because they are external, directed outwardly. There can be no thinking about the self. There is knowledge but not thought about the self. Thoughts are a covering, a shell.\nThoughtlessness removes the covering. Thoughtlessness is meditation. When there is no thinking, it is then we come to know the one hidden by our thoughts. When there are no clouds the blue sky comes into view. My friends, there is a sky within you as well. Remove the cloud of thoughts so it can be seen, so it can be known. This is possible. When the mind is at rest and there are no thoughts in it, then in the silence, in that deep thoughtlessness, in the total absence of thought, truth is seen.\nWhat can we do to bring this about? We must do a very simple thing but you will find it very difficult because you have become very complex. What is possible for a new born baby is impossible for you. The child simply looks and does not think. He just sees. And just seeing is wonderful. This is the secret, the key that can unlock the gate of truth.\nI am seeing you. I am just seeing you. Do you follow me? I am just seeing you; I am not thinking. And then an unprecedented calm, a living silence descends upon me and then everything is seen and everything is heard but nothing within is disturbed. There is no reaction inside; there are no thoughts. There is only darshan, only seeing.\nRight-awareness is the method of meditation. You have to see, only to see what is without and what is within. There are objects without, thoughts within. You have to look at them without any purpose whatsoever. There is no purpose, just seeing. You are a witness, a detached witness, and you are simply seeing. This observing, this watchfulness, gradually leads you into peace, into emptiness, into the void, into thoughtlessness. Try it and you will know. As thoughts dissolve, consciousness awakens and comes to life. Just casually stop a while – anywhere, anytime. Just look and listen\nand be a witness to the world and to yourself. Don’t think. Just be a witness and see what happens. Then let this witnessing spread. let is pervade all your physical and mental activities. Allow it to be with you always. If there is witnessing your ego will cease to be and you will see, will realize what you really are. The “I” will die and the self will be attained.\nIn this sadhana of witnessing, in this observing of one’s mental state, an easy transformation, an easy change over, takes place between what is being witnessed and the one that is the witness. As you observe your thoughts you get glimpses of the one that is observing. And then one day the seer appears in all his majesty and glory and all your poverty and wretchedness come to an end.\nThis is not a sadhana one can practice only once in a while and still attain liberation. This is to be practiced continuously, night and day. As one practices witnessing, as one moves more into the state of witnessing, that state becomes more stable and begins to be present all the time. Gradually it begins to be with you all the time, both awake and asleep. It even begins to be present in sleep. And when this happens, when it begins to be present even in sleep you can be certain it has gone deep within, that it has spread its roots far and wide. Today you are asleep even when you are awake. Tomorrow you will be awake even when you are asleep.\nThis witnessing dissolves thoughts by awakening us from our dreams and from our sleep. The waves dissolve in a mind free from thoughts and dreams. The mind becomes calm, waveless, without a tremor, just as the sea is calm when there are no waves, just as the flame of a lamp does not flicker when there are no breezes blowing into the house. It is in such a state that God is known, the one who is the self, who is me, who is truth. And then the gates to the palace of God open.\nThis gate, this entrance, does not lie in the shastras, in words – it lies int he self. That is why I say not to dig elsewhere but to dig within yourself. Don’t go anywhere else. Go into yourself. I have explained to you how to go in.\nFrom your serenity and the sparkle in your eyes I conclude you have understood what I have had to say. But this understanding alone is not enough. It is not understanding but spiritual experience alone that can become the foundation of a life of truth. Walk a bit in the direction I have indicated and see. Just proceed a little in that direction and see. Even if you only walk a little you will have gone a long way because when you move towards the truth, when you near it, you come under the influence of its pull – and then you do not walk at all, you are simply drawn to it.\nAnd finally, remember that a man who keeps walking will reach his destination one day. No step taken in God’s direction is in vain. I bear witness to this truth. How I want you too to realize this truth even for a moment so you can bear witness to it as well! It is so near to you. it is just a matter of your awakening. The sun is already up. You only have to open your eyes to see it.\nI invite you to open your eyes. Will you hear my call and open your eyes? The decision is yours and yours alone. To open or not to open?\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"6938","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_perfect_way/part8/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_perfect_way/>The Perfect Way</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">8 The Fourth Morning</h1><div class=post-meta>33 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;6938 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Perfect_Way/part8.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part7>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

your desire, of your thirst to know the truth. I see it in your eyes and
feel it in every breath you take. And as your hearts throb for the
attainment of truth my heart throbs as well! I am deeply touched by your
thirst for knowledge. It is such a delight! It is so beautiful! There is
nothing sweeter or more beautiful on earth than the desire to know the
truth.</p><p><br></p><p>In this moment of joy what shall I say to you? What shall I say to
you in this moment of your quest, as you await my words? It is only in
moments like this that we realize how insignificant and obscure words
are – just how meaningless and powerless they really are. When there is
nothing particularly worth saying they are able to convey it; when there
is something profound to say they are miserably inadequate. This is only
natural because the realization of truth, the experience of bliss and
the vision of beauty are so subtle and ethereal that no earthly form can
be attributed to them. And as soon as one attempts to ascribe a form to
them the experiences become dead and meaningless, and then the living
experience does not come into our hands alive, it is its corpse that
comes. The spirit is left behind and whatever the words refer to is no
longer true.</p><p><br></p><p>Then what should I say? Would it have been better not to have said
anything, for you not to have heard anything at all? How nice it would
have been if we had remained calm and quiet, speechless and silent, and
it you could have awakened and seen something in that silence, something
that truly is. In that case I would have saved myself from speaking and
you from listening and yet the truth would have been conveyed because
the eternal truth is within everyone. The music you are searching for
resounds and every moment in the depths of your being, and the moments
when you are searching for truth, even if they are silent, are
transformed into prayer. Both thirsting for god and waiting silently are
prayers.</p><p>What man is seeking is within his own self. What you have gathered
here to ask me about and to know from me is always within you. You have
never lost it. Nor can you ever lose it. It is your existence, your
being. I is the one treasure that can never be lost because you yourself
are that treasure. But we are all looking for it, searching for the very
thing that can never be lost. What a contradiction in terms!</p><p><br></p><p>I remember a wonderful sermon but I do not recall when or by whom it
was given.</p><p><br></p><p>One evening there was to be a very big gathering in a temple and so a
large number of monks had assembled. After a long wait the speaker
arrived. As he stood up to speak someone in the audience asked a
question, “What is truth?” An alert and expectant silence filled the
room. It was known that the speaker knew the answer and consequently
every one of his words was considered to be important. But do you know
what he said? He said, and very loudly, “O monks!” The silence resounded
with the two words and every eye was on him. All were silent, watchful.
But the speaker spoke no more. His speech was over; he had finished his
sermon.</p><p><br></p><p>Do you understand what he said? Had he said anything? In my view he
had said everything. Whatsoever was worth saying had been covered by his
two words. I too want to say the same thing. I will say the same thing.
It is the only thing that deserves to be said, that something words
cannot convey.</p><p><br></p><p>Then what did he say? He said, “Don’t look for truth anywhere
outside. Ask nobody about it. If it exists at all, it exists in you.
otherwise it does not exist at all.” So when he was asked about truth he
said absolutely nothing about it. He simply called to the congregation.
he called to them as you would awaken someone from sleep. This is the
only answer to the inquiry about truth.</p><p><br></p><p>To awaken is to attain truth. There is no other way. You are asleep
and therefore you cannot see what is standing by your side, you cannot
see what you really are. And in your dreams you wander far and wide in
search of it, in search of something that is already there in you, in
the seeker himself. You are like musk-deer wandering in search of
musk.</p><p><br></p><p>But no matter how hard you try to find that which lives in you, you
will not be able to find it. It cannot be attained by searching. Outside
things can be attained by searching but one cannot attain one’s self
with this kind of quest. The truth is not found by searching, it is
found by waking up. And that is why the speaker called out to the
assembly and spoke no further. And for this same reason Mahavira,
Buddha, Krishna and Christ have all been calling to you. This is not
speaking, but calling. This is not a sermon, but an address, a call.</p><p><br></p><p>I do not intend to speak either, I intend to call. Will you hear me?
Will you allow me to disturb your sleep and shatter your dreams? It may
well be that your dreams are sweet and gratifying, but it is the sweet
and gratifying dreams that are harmful because they will not let you
wake up but make the intoxication of sleep all the more intense.</p><p><br></p><p>I want you to witness the joy I am experiencing as the result of my
awakening. And so I have decided to call you. I will not speak to you
either, I will simply call you. Pardon me if my call disturbs your sleep
and disperses the fog of your dreams. I am helpless. Without shattering
your dreams nothing can be said about the truth. We are enveloped in
sleep and as long as this sleep continues all our actions are useless.
So long as you are asleep whatever you know is nothing but dreams.</p><p>The first thing to do is to awaken from this sleep. Everything else
will come later. Nothing is to be done before this. Don’t attach any
importance to the thoughts you think or to your actions during this
sleep. Just look on them as happenings in a dream. While your own self
is unknown to you it is impossible to do anything that is right, in the
real sense of that word. Your knowledge, your conduct, everything is
bound to be false. &amp;Your faith, your beliefs, your convictions will
all be blind. Whatsoever path you follow, it will not lead to the truth.
But there is no question of walking a path at present. Do you walk along
a path asleep? It is only a dream about walking.</p><p><br></p><p>The ignorance of the self is the sleep I am talking about to you. It
is necessary to awaken from it. In order to wake up from this sleep it
is also necessary to understand the factors that stand between you as
you are and this awakening. Before knowing religion you should first
know what religion isn’t and also understand what you are holding on to
as religion. Instead of awakening you this religion is more likely to be
like a sleeping pill.</p><p><br></p><p>Karl Marx called religion an opiate, a drug containing opium to put
you to sleep. Religion is definitely not an opiate but what is generally
mistaken for religion is. Marx was wrong to brand religion as an opiate
and you too are wrong. What you have done is mistake an opiate for
religion. Therefore, it is essential to know which is religion and which
is the opiate.</p><p><br></p><p>Let’s first consider what religion is not and then we will experience
what religion is. Thinking about irreligion is enough to see what
religion isn’t but for religion thought is not enough. To achieve
religion you have to pass through a sadhana.</p><p><br></p><p>First of all I want to mention one thing. If you really wish to reach
some level in religion or in religious life, you must begin by not
taking any belief or idea for granted. If you wish to know the truth do
not hold on to any preconceived notions about it. You must approach
truth in perfect calm and emptiness, and without any dogmas.
Preconceived notions and biases dim and distort your vision. What you
know then is not the truth but a projection of your own thinking. That
way, truth does not descend in you. On the contrary, you impose yourself
on truth.</p><p><br></p><p>Hold no theory or particular view about truth. Use your own judgment.
Only then will you know what is true. Otherwise you won’t be able to get
out of the web of the mind. What you know won’t be knowledge, it will be
imagination.</p><p><br></p><p>Man’s imagination has unlimited power and this imagination is the
wall between you and the truth. If you make up your mind about God, the
truth and the soul beforehand, your mind will stick to that decision and
will lead you to believe that you have really known something. But as a
matter of fact you have known nothing and are wandering in the realm of
imagination. This is not a vision of truth but a dream.</p><p><br></p><p>You know very well that your mind has an infinite capacity for
dreaming. Our desires show us things that do not exist at all. They
create mirages, and then that which truly is becomes hidden and that
which is not becomes apparent.</p><p><br></p><p>But you will say that dreaming only happens in sleep. It is true that
dreams happen in sleep, but sleep can also be induced and in one sense
you can even be asleep while you are awake. Don’t you day dream?</p><p>So if one continuously has a particular idea of God and, awake or
asleep, fills himself with that image, he can most definitely project
that image and have a direct vision of it. It is an intensified
daydream. There is actually nothing in front of the eyes, but what has
been nourished and nurtured behind the eyes has come up before him. This
is a projection; this is how dreams are seen.</p><p><br></p><p>And visions of truth based on preconceived ideas become possible as
well – and in this very fashion. A devotee of Christ has a vision of
Christ, a follower of Krishna sees Krishna and someone else’s disciples
sees someone else. By no means is this the vision or realization of God
or of truth. This is a projection of one’s imagination because there
cannot be two truths, two gods. Truth is one and realization is one, and
one who would know truth must give up his countless concepts and
imaginings. I am not asking you to give up your concepts in favor of one
concept in particular, I am asking you to give up all concepts. These
very concepts have given birth to many creeds and dogmas, and because of
this, innumerable creeds exist but there is no religion.</p><p><br></p><p>To know the truth all theories about it have to be forsaken. Only
those who are in a state beyond all prejudices and partialities, in a
state of total innocence and independence can know it. Where there is
neither concept, nor notion, nor expectation, is where and where alone
the truth can be realized. As a matter of fact, the effort to realize
the truth is not the effort to realize the truth but the effort to rid
ourselves of the state of dreaming.</p><p><br></p><p>What is the realization of truth? It is simply freedom from
hallucinations. This freedom is the realization of truth. Since we are
lost in dreams, what is always present appears to be absent, despite its
continuous presence.</p><p><br></p><p>Truth exists because truth always is. it does not have to be brought
from anywhere. It is ever- present. But we are not present. We are lost
in the wilderness of our dreams. No, it is not the truth we have to
bring to ourselves, we have to bring ourselves to the truth. It is
possible, not by seeing dreams and visions about God, but by doing away
with all the dreams and visions – and waking up.</p><p><br></p><p>Therefore I say that the truth does not need imagination, but
realization. The realization of the mind free from all imagination is
the realization of the mind in a state of truth. We see the world when
the mind is divided, when it is in a state of duality. We see the truth
when the mind is an undivided entity, a unity.</p><p><br></p><p>All concepts and all beliefs are conjecture and therefore not
gateways to the truth. They are obstacles and lead nowhere. On the
contrary, they block your path. The path of truth does not lie through
them but beyond them.</p><p><br></p><p>Please don’t adopt any idea or concept, or form any conviction or
belief about truth, because the belief you form will become an
experience. And that experience is not real but mental, imaginary. These
experiences are not spiritual. All beliefs about the truth that are
formed in ignorance are false. Do not think about what truth is and what
it is like. All such thoughts are blind. It is like a blind man trying
to imagine light. Poor thing! How can he conceive what light is! Without
eyesight he cannot conceive anything about light. Whatever he may think
will be fundamentally wrong. He cannot even imagine darkness accurately,
let alone light. One needs eyes to see darkness as well.</p><p><br></p><p>What can a man without eyesight do then? I would say to him, “Don’t
think about light. Treat your eyes.” It isn’t thinking but treatment
that can be helpful. But what do I see? I see him being given</p><p>sermons, I see the philosophy of light being explained to him. But
nobody bothers about treatment for the eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>And what is more surprising is that those who are sermonizing on the
subject of light have never seen the light themselves! They too know
about light, but they have not known light. I say this because if they
had known light they would have realized the futility of all sermons and
would have focused their concern and sympathy on the treatment for
blindness. If the eyesight is cured, light is experienced automatically.
What is required for sight is always present. If there is sight, there
is light.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sight” and “light” are words that can lead in very different
directions. Thinking about light leads to philosophy. It is the
direction of thinking alone. It does not lead to experience; it is
merely thought. There is a lot of walking but no destination is ever
reached. There are many conclusions but none that can solve our
problems. This is only natural. Even the most perfect thought about
water cannot quench one’s thirst the slightest bit. The way to quench
one’s thirst is quite different.</p><p><br></p><p>The path, the sadhana, is not the way of thinking, it is the
treatment of sight. I have said that thinking about light is philosophy
and now I want to say that vision through sight is religion. You can
reach intellectual conclusions by thinking, while a sadhana gives you
spiritual vision, spiritual experiences. The former is like thinking
about water; the latter, like quenching one’s thirst. The former is a
problem; the latter, a solution.</p><p><br></p><p>I ask everyone this question: “Do you want to know light or to know
about light?” and you – do you want to know truth or do you want to know
about truth? Do you want to know about water or do you want to quench
your thirst? Your answer to these questions will decide whether you are
thirsty for knowledge or whether you just want to collect
information.</p><p><br></p><p>And don’t forget that these are opposite directions. One leads to the
ultimate dissolution of the ego; the other, to its peak. One makes you
innocent while the other makes you complex. Knowledge destroys the ego
whereas information pumps it up and inflates it all the more. All
collecting, all acquiring fills the ego, and for this reason the ego is
always on the lookout for more.</p><p><br></p><p>Thoughts are also acquisitions, although quite subtle ones. Thought
also feeds the ego. The hypocrisy you find among scholars is neither
spontaneous nor accidental, it is the natural outcome of thought.</p><p><br></p><p>Thoughts are acquired. They crowd in from the outside world, they are
not born within. They are not of the soul but they are its wall sin a
way. From outside, information about light can be given to a blind man
but the sensation of light has to be produced in him from within. One is
acquisition and energy is the difference between information and
knowledge. Acquisition comes from outside; energy, from inside.</p><p><br></p><p>But acquisition gives the illusion of energy. This illusion is quite
strong and it nourishes the ego. Egoism is not energy, it is an illusion
of energy. It is non-energy in fact, because one tiny spark of truth can
destroy it, can evaporate it. It is for this reason that one’s true
energy is entirely free of egoism.</p><p>I hope you have been able to follow the distinction between learning
and wisdom. It is imperative you understand it. False knowledge is an
even greater hindrance on the path of self-realization than ignorance.
False knowledge is the impression of “I know” when you really do not
know . Such a false impression can easily grow out of the acquisition of
others’ thoughts, from learning, from schooling. This false impression
also comes out of a knowledge of the scriptures, of a knowledge of
words. And because of this knowledge of words men seem to think they
have realized the truth.</p><p><br></p><p>Words become part of the memory. They form into questions and each
question carries an automatic reply. One’s sense of discrimination is
lost in and dominated by the borrowed ideas and, before a man can look
for any reply from within, the thick layer of borrowed words and ideas
pops out a ready-made answer. In this way we can’t work out the problem,
we are robbed of its solution. If a problem is mine it is my solution
alone that is required. No borrowed or secondhand solution can be of any
help.</p><p><br></p><p>One can neither borrow life nor the solutions to its problems. The
solution to a problem does not come from outside. It is inherent in the
problem. The solution evolves out of the problem. If the problem is
within, the truth cannot be outside. And the truth cannot be learned
therefore. It has to be laid bare. You have to discover it. It isn’t
through training but by realization alone that the truth can be known.
And this is the fundamental difference between the one who has learned
the scriptures and the one who has realized the soul. It is enough to be
well versed in the scriptures as far as this world is concerned but not
so in the realm of the spirit. In that sphere, it is far less than even
the starting point.</p><p><br></p><p>You can only have information about that is not you, about the world,
about the world of matter. Of these things you cannot have knowledge.
Whatsoever pertains to outside can only be known from outside. You may
be very close to it but it will still be far away. However tiny the
distance between us might be, it will never end. It will always be
there. So we can only become familiar with things that are non-us but we
can never have knowledge about them. We can know about something but the
something itself we cannot know.</p><p><br></p><p>The total elimination of distance is the prerequisite of all
knowledge. Only then can you enter your inner being. But what is distant
can never be anything but distant. It can only be otherwise if there is
no distance in reality. Distance can be eliminated only if it is
illusory. If it is real, its elimination is not possible.</p><p><br></p><p>There is one and only one being not distant from me. It is impossible
for this being to be distant from me. I am that being. Yes, it is my own
self. Of that being alone, is real knowledge possible. The distance from
this being is just an illusion because how can there be any distance
from oneself? I alone am the center of my self and it is here I have my
inner portal, my inner abode and the abiding throne of perfection.
Knowledge of this alone is possible.</p><p><br></p><p>I also want to remind you of another fact: we cannot know the world,
we can only make its acquaintance and gather information about it. But
of the self, only knowledge is possible. So there can be no information
about the self, about atman – only knowledge of the soul is possible.
That is why, in the case of objects, in the case of material things, in
non-us things, it is enough to be expert in the shastras, in the
scriptures, but in the case of the self it is not enough.</p><p>Science is a shastra; religion is not. Science is a shastra; religion
is not. Science is information about objects while religion is knowledge
of the self. Science is a shastra, a scripture; religion is a sadhana,
the path to realization.</p><p><br></p><p>I am not preaching a sermon. That approach is totally fruitless. What
is required is not a sermon but treatment. I do not intend to expound on
any doctrines pertaining to truth. They are altogether useless. However,
what is of value is the method by which one can see truth. This method
serves as a treatment for the illness and because of it the eyes open.
Then you don’t have to think about light, you see it straightaway. When
sight is absent you have to think, but when there is sight, thinking
will be out of the question. In blindness, thinking does the work of the
eyes, but as soon as sight is restored thinking becomes unnecessary.</p><p><br></p><p>In my viewpoint, thought is not a sign of knowledge but of ignorance.
Knowledge is a state of thoughtlessness. It is not thinking, it is
insight. And this insight is not possible through any dogma about truth.
Dogmas merely reduce things to intellectual acquisitions and they become
parts of the memory. They can never become parts of knowledge.</p><p><br></p><p>Dogmas can be taught but they cannot change one’s real personality.
Like clothing, they effect a change on the outer level but the inner
being remains what it was. The spirit remains untouched by them and the
veil, the cover, takes on a new form and a new color. If you are this
way, wisdom cannot descend upon you. On the contrary, you will fall into
the ditch of hypocrisy.</p><p><br></p><p>There is a great gulf between a man’s being and knowledge. He is one
thing and what he knows is quite another thing. His personality is split
in two. There is both conflict and duality between his inner being and
his outer shell. And the natural result of this is hypocrisy. Such a man
begins to present himself as someone who is not really there in him, and
begins to hide the one who is. This acting is irreligious. It not only
ruins the lives of others but one’s own life as well. This is
self-deception but it passes for being religious.</p><p><br></p><p>The intellectual teachings of dogmas, of doctrines, can only do this
much: they can change the outer wrapping for a spiritual revolution some
other approach is necessary. The approach should not be one of doctrine
but of sadhana, of walking the path of self-realization. It is not the
approach of sermons but of treatment. It is not the approach of thinking
about truth but of opening the eyes to truth.</p><p><br></p><p>Religion is the method of opening the eyes. If your eyes open the
vision of God becomes easy. But doctrines will not open your eyes. On
the contrary, those who are deluded by them forget that their eyes are
closed and that the truths they discuss have not been seen by them with
their own eyes but by the eyes of others. The truth seen by another is
like a meal eaten by another. It has no purpose whatsoever for anyone
else.</p><p><br></p><p>The realization of truth is wholly private and personal and is by no
means transferable. It can neither be received nor given. It has to be
attained by oneself. It cannot be stolen or accepted in charity. It is
not a piece of property, it is one’s own self. Truth is not property, it
is one’s own self and it is therefore non-transferable. So far no one
has ever given it to anyone. Nor will anybody in the future ever be able
to give it to anyone because the moment it is given it ceases to be the
truth, it becomes an object. An object can be given or taken. Truth has
to be attained within oneself, by oneself. It is</p><p>subjective. In fact, it is not really to be attained – one has to
become it. It is your own being, your own existence.</p><p><br></p><p>So where does the question of learning truth come in? It must be
discovered. Learning only forms layers over the self. All outside
teachings only cover truth. Whatever comes from outside can only cover.
Covering is the only thing possible from outside. And the garments of
thought continue to cover the self more and more. Strip off these
garments and be naked. Throw all these garment away. In order to know
your self you have to unlearn, not learn. When all the outside guests
have gone you will know the one who is not a guest, but the host.</p><p><br></p><p>The truth cannot be taught but the method of knowing truth can.
Today, no one speaks of this method. Although there is a lot of talk
about truth, there is no talk about the method of realizing the truth.
There can be no greater mistake than this. It is clinging to the body
and missing life. As a result of this there are countless religions, but
no religion with a capital R.</p><p><br></p><p>The numerous sects that masquerade under the name of religions are
not religion at all. There can only be one religion. There can be no
adjective to describe it. It is without any qualifying term. Dharma
means dharma – religion means religion. In my language you can’t say
“this dharma”, “that dharma”. Where there is “this” and “that” there is
no religion.</p><p><br></p><p>These sects have come into being because of the many doctrines and
theories about truth and they will continue to exist as long as people
demand theories and doctrines. Doctrines consist of words and sects form
around these very words. The words become causes of conflict, feeding
animosities and petty hates. These words divide man from man. and how
strange it is! The people believe that the very words that divide man
from man will unite man with God! That which divides man from man cannot
possibly unite him with God, with truth, nor with his self.</p><p><br></p><p>This splitting up of religion into sects can be traced to various
doctrines, to words, to beliefs, to opinions. All of this is based on
ignorance and not on knowledge. Truth has no sect. All sects evolve out
of doctrines. As soon as a man knows the truth he is free from sects and
at that very moment he enters religion – a religion that is neither
Hindu nor Jain, Christian nor Mohammedan, but simply religion –
unqualified, nothing but light, nothing but consciousness. Religion is
truly the realization of one’s self.</p><p><br></p><p>A sect is not religious. What does organization have to do with
religion? All organizations are political or social; they are all
worldly. They are based on fear of one another and where there is fear
there is hatred. They come into existence not out of truth, but for
security. Be it a nation, a society or a sect, all are born out of fear,
and the satisfaction of what is born out of fear lies in causing fear in
others.</p><p><br></p><p>All sects are exactly like this. They do not intend to make anyone
religious, they want to increase their numbers. Numbers are power and
guarantees of security. They are both self-protection and the capacity
to attack. Sects have been like this all along. They are still like this
and will continue to be the same. They haven’t united man and religion,
they’ve torn him away from it.</p><p><br></p><p>Dharma, religion, is not a social phenomenon, it is purely and simply
the most personal transformation. It has nothing to do with others; it
is concerned with one’s own self alone. It isn’t</p><p>concerned with what a man does with others but what he does with
himself. Dharma is concerned with how you behave with yourself in your
total isolation and loneliness.</p><p><br></p><p>What are you in your total isolation? That is what you must know –
who you are. Only the knowledge of your being will lead you to religion.
There is no other way to lead someone to religion. No temple, no mosque,
no church can take me to the place where I am. You don’t have to climb
any outside stairs to get there. All temples are outside. All temples
are part of samsara, of the world, and you cannot reach the self through
their doors. No journey in the outer world can be a pilgrimage to truth,
to the holy place. That place is within, where one has the experience of
religion and where the mystery, joy and beauty of life are discovered.
Without these everything is miserable; everything is useless,
meaningless.</p><p><br></p><p>In order to know the self you have to go inside, not outside. But all
man’s senses take him outwards. They all move outside. His eyes look
outwards, his hands spread outwards, his legs move outwards and even his
mind reflects and echoes external phenomena. And this is why he has
erected idols, images of god, and has created temples to truth. It is so
his eyes can see God and his feet can make a pilgrimage to truth! We
have created this self-deception ourselves; we have taken this cup of
poison with our own hands. And now we waste away our lives nad spend
them in stupor, brought about by this poison and self-deception.</p><p><br></p><p>To suit the convenience of our senses we have visualized religion as
being outside ourselves and so have directed our sight outwards. But you
have to go behind the scenes to know dharma, to know religion. Your
knowledge and consciousness of the world comes through the medium of the
senses. You cannot possibly know the self by the same route. It is not
possible to know the one who knows, to know the one who is knowledge,
like another person or an object can be known. The seer, the power to
see, cannot be looked at like an ordinary object. Knowledge can neither
be transferred nor degraded into an object. And the whole problem is
because this simple fact has not been understood. People search for god
as if he were an external object. How stupid this is! God is not to be
searched for, he is hidden in the seeker himself.</p><p><br></p><p>Truth is within you. It is within me. And it is not that it will be
within you tomorrow, it is in you here and now, at this very moment. I
am. My being itself is my truth. And whatever I see may not be the
truth, it may all be a dream. I see dreams too and while I see them they
seem to be true. You may all be a dream for me. It may well be that I am
in a dream and you are not present here at all. But the seer cannot be
false. He cannot be in a dream because if he were he would not be able
to see that it is a dream. A dream cannot see a dream. Untruth cannot
know untruth. Seeing a dream requires someone who is not a dream
himself. Even to see untruth a true seer is necessary. Therefore I say I
am the truth. Truth is my being. I don’t have to go anywhere in search
of it.</p><p><br></p><p>You only have to dig out the truth from within yourself. Just as you
dig out a well, you have to dig truth out. There are always a few layers
of stones and earth covering the spring of water, but as soon as you
remove those layers the spring is freed. In the same way your self is
pressed down by layers of other things, of things that belong to
non-self. You only have to break through these layers and what you have
been searching for through countless past lives is attained.</p><p><br></p><p>So far you have been unable to attain the truth because you have been
searching for it far and wide, while as a matter of fact it has always
been very near. It is really the one who is searching. You must</p><p>dig out the well of your soul. And meditation is the means to that
end. With the spade of meditation you have to remove the layers of
earth, the layers of otherness that have piled up on the self. It is the
only remedy, the only treatment. This is what I intend to talk
about.</p><p><br></p><p>First of all, it is necessary to know what it is that has covered up
your own being, your very nature. What is it that hides you from
yourself? Can’t you see it? Can’t you see what the covering is? When you
go inside what do you find?</p><p><br></p><p>Hume has said, “whenever I have gone inside I have been unable to
find anything but thoughts.” Hume did not locate any soul, nor will you
find yours in this way. Hume saw only the covering layers and came back;
he went only as far as the shell and returned. It is only when you break
the shell open that you will see what is inside. This is just like a man
who goes to a lake and seeing the surface covered with moss and leaves
returns to say there is no lake at all. Generally this is what happens.
We go inside every day, see the covering of thoughts and return.
Thoughts always surround the self and you know nothing but thoughts.
Thoughts are your world and he who lives in thoughts alone is a worldly
man. To know anything beyond thought is the beginning of becoming
religious. To know the state of thoughtlessness, to know what is beyond
thought is to enter the domain of religion.</p><p><br></p><p>It may be that your thoughts are not about this world but are about
the soul, about God, and you may be under the illusion that you are
religious. I want to smash this illusion of yours. All thoughts are a
covering, an outer shell. They are all desires, passions, because they
are external, directed outwardly. There can be no thinking about the
self. There is knowledge but not thought about the self. Thoughts are a
covering, a shell.</p><p><br></p><p>Thoughtlessness removes the covering. Thoughtlessness is meditation.
When there is no thinking, it is then we come to know the one hidden by
our thoughts. When there are no clouds the blue sky comes into view. My
friends, there is a sky within you as well. Remove the cloud of thoughts
so it can be seen, so it can be known. This is possible. When the mind
is at rest and there are no thoughts in it, then in the silence, in that
deep thoughtlessness, in the total absence of thought, truth is
seen.</p><p><br></p><p>What can we do to bring this about? We must do a very simple thing
but you will find it very difficult because you have become very
complex. What is possible for a new born baby is impossible for you. The
child simply looks and does not think. He just sees. And just seeing is
wonderful. This is the secret, the key that can unlock the gate of
truth.</p><p><br></p><p>I am seeing you. I am just seeing you. Do you follow me? I am just
seeing you; I am not thinking. And then an unprecedented calm, a living
silence descends upon me and then everything is seen and everything is
heard but nothing within is disturbed. There is no reaction inside;
there are no thoughts. There is only darshan, only seeing.</p><p><br></p><p>Right-awareness is the method of meditation. You have to see, only to
see what is without and what is within. There are objects without,
thoughts within. You have to look at them without any purpose
whatsoever. There is no purpose, just seeing. You are a witness, a
detached witness, and you are simply seeing. This observing, this
watchfulness, gradually leads you into peace, into emptiness, into the
void, into thoughtlessness. Try it and you will know. As thoughts
dissolve, consciousness awakens and comes to life. Just casually stop a
while – anywhere, anytime. Just look and listen</p><p>and be a witness to the world and to yourself. Don’t think. Just be a
witness and see what happens. Then let this witnessing spread. let is
pervade all your physical and mental activities. Allow it to be with you
always. If there is witnessing your ego will cease to be and you will
see, will realize what you really are. The “I” will die and the self
will be attained.</p><p><br></p><p>In this sadhana of witnessing, in this observing of one’s mental
state, an easy transformation, an easy change over, takes place between
what is being witnessed and the one that is the witness. As you observe
your thoughts you get glimpses of the one that is observing. And then
one day the seer appears in all his majesty and glory and all your
poverty and wretchedness come to an end.</p><p><br></p><p>This is not a sadhana one can practice only once in a while and still
attain liberation. This is to be practiced continuously, night and day.
As one practices witnessing, as one moves more into the state of
witnessing, that state becomes more stable and begins to be present all
the time. Gradually it begins to be with you all the time, both awake
and asleep. It even begins to be present in sleep. And when this
happens, when it begins to be present even in sleep you can be certain
it has gone deep within, that it has spread its roots far and wide.
Today you are asleep even when you are awake. Tomorrow you will be awake
even when you are asleep.</p><p><br></p><p>This witnessing dissolves thoughts by awakening us from our dreams
and from our sleep. The waves dissolve in a mind free from thoughts and
dreams. The mind becomes calm, waveless, without a tremor, just as the
sea is calm when there are no waves, just as the flame of a lamp does
not flicker when there are no breezes blowing into the house. It is in
such a state that God is known, the one who is the self, who is me, who
is truth. And then the gates to the palace of God open.</p><p><br></p><p>This gate, this entrance, does not lie in the shastras, in words – it
lies int he self. That is why I say not to dig elsewhere but to dig
within yourself. Don’t go anywhere else. Go into yourself. I have
explained to you how to go in.</p><p><br></p><p>From your serenity and the sparkle in your eyes I conclude you have
understood what I have had to say. But this understanding alone is not
enough. It is not understanding but spiritual experience alone that can
become the foundation of a life of truth. Walk a bit in the direction I
have indicated and see. Just proceed a little in that direction and see.
Even if you only walk a little you will have gone a long way because
when you move towards the truth, when you near it, you come under the
influence of its pull – and then you do not walk at all, you are simply
drawn to it.</p><p><br></p><p>And finally, remember that a man who keeps walking will reach his
destination one day. No step taken in God’s direction is in vain. I bear
witness to this truth. How I want you too to realize this truth even for
a moment so you can bear witness to it as well! It is so near to you. it
is just a matter of your awakening. The sun is already up. You only have
to open your eyes to see it.</p><p><br></p><p>I invite you to open your eyes. Will you hear my call and open your
eyes? The decision is yours and yours alone. To open or not to open?</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part7>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

‌CHAPTER 1
The Ultimate Experience
11 February 1975 am in Buddha Hall
IN HIS SONG OF MAHAMUDRA, TILOPA SAYS:
MAHAMUDRA IS BEYOND ALL WORDS AND SYMBOLS, BUT FOR YOU, NAROPA, EARNEST AND LOYAL, MUST THIS BE SAID:
THE VOID NEEDS NO RELIANCE, MAHAMUDRA RESTS ON NOUGHT. WITHOUT MAKING AN EFFORT, BUT REMAINING LOOSE AND NATURAL, ONE CAN BREAK THE YOKE – THUS GAINING LIBERATION.</description>

‌CHAPTER 10
The Supreme Understanding
20 February 1975 am in Buddha Hall
THE SONG ENDS:
THE SUPREME UNDERSTANDING TRANSCENDS ALL THIS AND THAT. THE SUPREME ACTION EMBRACES GREAT RESOURCEFULNESS WITHOUT ATTACHMENT. THE SUPREME ACCOMPLISHMENT IS TO REALIZE IMMANENCE WITHOUT HOPE. AT FIRST A YOGI FEELS HIS MIND IS TUMBLING LIKE A WATERFALL; IN MID-COURSE, LIKE THE GANGES, IT FLOWS ON SLOW AND GENTLE; IN THE END IT IS A GREAT VAST OCEAN WHERE THE LIGHTS OF SON AND MOTHER MERGE IN ONE.</description>

‌CHAPTER 2
The Root Problem
12 February 1975 am in Buddha Hall
THE SONG CONTINUES:
IF ONE SEES NOUGHT WHEN STARING INTO SPACE; IF WITH THE MIND ONE THEN OBSERVES THE MIND, ONE DESTROYS DISTINCTIONS AND REACHES BUDDHAHOOD.
THE CLOUDS THAT WANDER THROUGH THE SKY HAVE NO ROOTS, NO HOME; NOR DO THE DISTINCTIVE THOUGHTS FLOATING THROUGH THE MIND. ONCE THE SELF-MIND IS SEEN, DISCRIMINATION STOPS.</description>

‌CHAPTER 3
The Nature of Darkness and of Light
13 February 1975 am in Buddha Hall
THE SONG CONTINUES:
THE DARKNESS OF AGES CANNOT SHROUD THE GLOWING SUN; THE LONG KALPAS OF SAMSARA NE’ER CAN HIDE – THE MIND’S BRILLIANT LIGHT.
THOUGH WORDS ARE SPOKEN TO EXPLAIN THE VOID, – THE VOID AS SUCH CAN NEVER BE EXPRESSED. THOUGH WE SAY “THE MIND IS BRIGHT AS LIGHT,” IT IS BEYOND ALL WORDS AND SYMBOLS.</description>

‌CHAPTER 4
Be Like a Hollow Bamboo
14 February 1975 am in Buddha Hall
THE SONG CONTINUES:
DO NOUGHT WITH THE BODY BUT RELAX; SHUT FIRM THE MOUTH AND SILENT REMAIN; EMPTY YOUR MIND AND THINK OF NOUGHT. LIKE A HOLLOW BAMBOO REST AT EASE WITH YOUR BODY. GIVING NOT NOR TAKING, PUT YOUR MIND AT REST. MAHAMUDRA IS LIKE A MIND THAT CLINGS TO NOUGHT.</description>

‌CHAPTER 5
The Innate Truth
15 February 1975 am in Buddha Hall
THE SONG CONTINUES:
THE PRACTICE OF MANTRA AND PARAMITA, INSTRUCTION IN THE SUTRAS AND PRECEPTS, AND TEACHING FROM THE SCHOOLS AND SCRIPTURES, WILL NOT BRING REALIZATION OF THE INNATE TRUTH. FOR IF THE MIND WHEN FILLED WITH SOME DESIRE SHOULD SEEK A GOAL, IT ONLY HIDES THE LIGHT.
HE WHO KEEPS TANTRIC PRECEPTS, YET DISCRIMINATES, BETRAYS THE SPIRIT OF SAMAYA.</description>

‌CHAPTER 6
The Great Teaching
16 February 1975 am in Buddha Hall
THE SONG CONTINUES:
IN MAHAMUDRA ALL ONE’S SINS ARE BURNED; IN MAHAMUDRA ONE IS RELEASED FROM THE PRISON OF THIS WORLD. THIS IS THE DHARMA’S SUPREME TORCH. THOSE WHO DISBELIEVE IT ARE FOOLS, WHO EVER WALLOW IN MISERY AND SORROW.
TO STRIVE FOR LIBERATION ONE SHOULD RELY ON A GURU. WHEN YOUR MIND RECEIVES HIS BLESSING EMANCIPATION IS AT HAND.</description>

‌CHAPTER 7
The Pathless Path
17 February 1975 am in Buddha Hall
THE SONG CONTINUES:
TO TRANSCEND DUALITY IS THE KINGLY VIEW. TO CONQUER DISTRACTIONS IS THE ROYAL PRACTICE. THE PATH OF NO-PRACTICE IS THE WAY OF ALL BUDDHAS. HE WHO TREADS THAT PATH REACHES BUDDHAHOOD.
TRANSIENT IS THIS WORLD, LIKE PHANTOMS AND DREAMS, SUBSTANCE IT HAS NONE. RENOUNCE IT AND FORSAKE YOUR KIN, CUT THE STRINGS OF LUST AND HATRED, AND MEDITATE IN WOODS AND MOUNTAINS.</description>

‌CHAPTER 8
Cut the Root
18 February 1975 am in Buddha Hall
THE SONG CONTINUES:
CUT THE ROOT OF A TREE AND THE LEAVES WILL WITHER; CUT THE ROOT OF YOUR MIND AND SAMSARA FALLS. THE LIGHT OF ANY LAMP DISPELS IN A MOMENT THE DARKNESS OF LONG KALPAS; THE STRONG LIGHT OF THE MIND IN BUT A FLASH WILL BURN THE VEIL OF IGNORANCE.</description>

‌CHAPTER 9
Beyond and Beyond
19 February 1975 am in Buddha Hall
THE SONG CONTINUES:
ONE SHOULD NOT GIVE OR TAKE, BUT REMAIN NATURAL – FOR MAHAMUDRA IS BEYOND ALL ACCEPTANCE AND REJECTION. SINCE ALAYA IS NOT BORN, NO ONE CAN OBSTRUCT OR SOIL IT; STAYING IN THE UNBORN REALM ALL APPEARANCE WILL DISSOLVE INTO DHARMATA, AND SELF-WILL AND PRIDE WILL VANISH INTO NOUGHT.</description>

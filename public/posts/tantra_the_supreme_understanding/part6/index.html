WHEN YOUR MIND RECEIVES HIS BLESSING EMANCIPATION IS AT HAND.\nALAS, ALL THINGS IN THIS WORLD ARE MEANINGLESS, THEY ARE BUT SORROW’S SEEDS. SMALL TEACHINGS LEAD TO ACTS – ONE SHOULD ONLY FOLLOW TEACHINGS THAT ARE GREAT.\nTantra believes, not in gradual development of the soul, but in sudden enlightenment. Yoga believes in gradual development: inch by inch, step by step, you progress towards the final.\nYoga is very arithmetical: for each sin that you have committed you have to balance it by a virtuous act; your account has to be closed completely. Without completing the account with this world, you cannot become enlightened. It is a mathematical conception, scientific, and the mind will say, “Of course, it has to be so. You committed sins – who is going to suffer for them? You committed sins, you have to suffer for them. And only through suffering can you become liberated. Evil have been your acts; you have to balance them, you have to pay for them, and you have to move in good acts. When the balance is complete, then only liberation is possible; otherwise, you will have to be\nthrown again and again to the earth, to be reborn, to move, to grow.” That is the whole philosophy of transmigration, rebirth.\nTantra says just the opposite. Tantra is a very very poetic approach, not arithmetical. And tantra believes in love, not in mathematics; it believes in sudden enlightenment. And it says that small teachings teach you about action; great teachings don’t teach you about how to act, they teach you what to be, how to be.\nActions are millions, and if you have to pay for all the actions, it seems almost impossible that you are ever going to be liberated. Millions of lives you have lived; in each life, millions of acts you have committed. If you are going to pay for all those acts, suffer, and you have to balance each bad act with a good one, it will take again millions of lives for you. And meanwhile, in the complex relationship of life, you will be committing many more actions. So where will this chain end? It seems impossible. Liberation becomes almost impossible – it cannot happen. If this is the way, that inch by inch one has to grow, then growth seems an impossible dream.\nIf you understand the attitude of yoga, you will feel very very hopeless. Tantra is a great hope. Tantra is like an oasis in a world of deserts.\nTantra says this is not the point at all: acts are not the question. You committed them because you were ignorant, they came out of your ignorance. In fact, tantra says you are not responsible for them. If somebody is responsible, then the whole – you may call it God – God may be responsible, but you cannot be responsible. Tantra says that even to take this responsibility is very egoistic. To say, “I will have to balance, I will have to do good acts, I will have to liberate myself inch by inch and step by step,” this too is a very egoistic, ego-centered attitude.\nWhy do you think you are responsible? Even if responsibility has to be somewhere, then it has to be with the divine himself, with the whole. You have not created yourself, you have not given birth to yourself. You have been given birth, you have been created – then the creator must be responsible, not you.\nAnd you committed all your actions in ignorance, you were not aware of what you were doing, you were completely drunk with ignorance. In darkness you were groping, in darkness you came in conflict with others, in darkness you stumbled upon things and something happened. Tantra says the only thing that is needed is light, awareness. Not millions of acts have to be answered; only one thing has to be done and that is: don’t remain ignorant, become aware.\nOnce you become aware, all that belongs to the world of darkness disappears. It will look like a dream, a nightmare. It will not look like a reality. And it has not been a reality, because when you are deep down unconscious, only dreams can exist, not reality. You have been dreaming that you loved. You cannot love. You are not there to love. You still don’t exist, you don’t have any center. How can you love? You only believe that you love, and then your love life and the acts concerned with it... it becomes a dream. When you will awaken out of this dreaming, you will simply say, “How could I have loved? Impossible! I was not there in the first place. I was nonexistential in fact.” Without awareness, what does it mean to say, “I am”? It means nothing.\nYou are fast asleep, so deeply asleep, as if you are not there. A person fast asleep, in a coma in the house – is he really there? There is no distinction to be made. Whether he is there or not makes\nno distinction – he is in a coma. If thieves come and rob the whole house, will you call that man responsible who is lying down in a coma, unconscious? Will he be responsible? Will he be asked and judged: “Thieves came! What were you doing here?” How can you make a man responsible who is in a coma, unconscious?\nTantra says in all your lives you have remained in a coma – you are not responsible. This is the first liberation that tantra gives you. And on the base of it, many things immediately become possible. Then you need not wait for millions of lives – this very moment the door can open. It is not a gradual process, it is a sudden awakening – and it has to be so.\nWhen you are fast asleep and somebody tries to wake you up, is it a gradual process or a sudden thing? Even in ordinary sleep, is it a gradual process or a sudden thing? Even in ordinary sleep, is it a gradual process? Is it like this, that first you become a little awake, then a little more, and then a little more; ten percent, twenty percent, thirty percent, fifty percent; that way does it happen? No. Either you are awake or you are asleep; there are no gradual steps in it. If you have heard the man who is calling your name, you are awake, not ten percent awake. Eyes may be closed, but if you have become aware that somebody is calling you, you are already awake.\nIt is not a gradual process, it is a sudden jump. At one hundred degrees, the water jumps and becomes vapor. Is there any gradual transformation? Does the water first become ten percent, twenty percent, thirty percent? No. Either it is water or it is vapor; there is no middle ground to be divided.\nWhen a person dies, is he dead by and by, in a gradual process? Can you say that he is half-alive and half-dead? What will it mean? How can a person be half-alive? Either he is dead or he is not dead. Half-alive means he is not dead.\nWhen you love a person, do you love ten percent, twenty percent, thirty percent? Either you love or you don’t love. Is there any possibility of dividing your love? There is no possibility.\nLove, life, death, they all happen suddenly.\nWhen a child is born, he is either born or not born. And the same is true about enlightenment, because that is the ultimate birth, ultimate death, ultimate life, ultimate love – everything comes to its ultimate peak in enlightenment. It is a sudden thing.\nTantra says: Don’t focus your attention on the acts, focus your attention on the person who has done the acts. Yoga focuses on the acts. Tantra focuses on the person, on the consciousness, on you.\nIf you are ignorant, tantra says you are bound to commit sin. Even if you try to be virtuous, your virtue will be a sort of sin – because how can an ignorant man, fast asleep, be virtuous? How can virtue arise out of ignorance, unconsciousness? Impossible! Your virtue must be just a mask; behind it will be the real face, the real face of sin.\nYou may talk about love, but you cannot love – you will hate. You can talk about compassion, but compassion must be just a covering of your anger, greed, jealousy. Your love is poisonous. Deep inside in your love is the worm of hate, eating it continuously. Your love is like a wound, it hurts.\nIt is not like a flower, it cannot be. And those who expect love from you are fools, they are asking the impossible. Those who ask from you morality are fools, they are asking the impossible. Your morality is bound to be a sort of immorality.\nLook at your moral persons, your so-called saints. Watch and observe them and you will find their faces are just the faces of hypocrisy, deception. They say something, they do something else. They do something, and they not only hide it from you – they have become so clever in hiding, they hide it from themselves.\nIn ignorance, sin is natural. In enlightenment, virtue is natural. A buddha cannot sin; you cannot do otherwise – you can only sin. Sin and virtue are not your decisions, they are not your acts, they are shadows of your being. If you awaken, then the shadow falls and the shadow is full of light. And the shadow never harms anybody, it cannot harm; it has a flavor of the unknown, of the immortal. It can only shower on you like a blessing; otherwise is not possible. Even if a buddha gets angry with you, it is compassion – it cannot be otherwise. Your compassion is not true; Buddha’s anger cannot be true. Your sin, your natural shadow, whatsoever you do – you can decorate it, you can make a temple on top of it, you can hide it, you can beautify it, but that won’t help – deep inside you will find it there, because it is not a question of what you do, it is a question of what you are.\nLook at the emphasis. If you understand this change of emphasis, and this change of emphasis is a great point, only then you will be able to understand tantra.\nTantra is a great teaching. It doesn’t teach about acts, it teaches only about your being. Who you are is the point – fast asleep, snoring, or awake? Who are you – alert, conscious, or moving in a hypnosis? Are you a sleepwalker? or are you awake, alert, whatsoever you do? Do you do it with self-remembrance? No. It happens – you don’t know why, from where it comes, from what part of the unconscious comes an urge which possesses you, and you have to act.\nThis act, whatsoever the society says about it – moral or immoral, sin or virtue – tantra doesn’t bother about it. Tantra looks at you, at the very center of your being from where it comes. Out of the poison of your ignorance, life cannot come, only death. Out of your darkness, only darkness is born. And that seems to be absolutely natural. So what to do? Should we try to change the acts? Should we try to become more moral, virtuous, respectable? Or should we try to change the being?\nThe being can be changed. There is no need to wait for it for infinite lives. If you have the intensity of understanding, if you bring your total effort, energy, being, to understand it, in that very intensity, a light suddenly burns in you. A flame comes up from your being like lightning, and your whole past and your whole future is suddenly in your vision – you understand what has happened, you understand what is happening, you understand what is going to happen. Suddenly everything has become clear; as if it was dark and somebody brought a light, and suddenly everything is clear.\nTantra believes in burning your inner light. And tantra says that with that light, the past simply becomes irrelevant. It never belonged to you. Of course, it happened, but happened as if in a dream and you were fast asleep. It happened – you did many things, good and bad, but they all happened in unconsciousness, you were not responsible. And suddenly everything of the past is burnt down, a fresh and virgin being comes up – this is sudden enlightenment.\nYoga appeals to people because it looks very businesslike. You can understand Patanjali very easily because it fits with your own mind, the logical mind, the mathematical thinking. Tilopa is difficult to comprehend, but Tilopa is rare. Patanjali’s understanding is common – that’s why there is so much influence of Patanjali all through history.\nPeople like Tilopa have simply disappeared without leaving any trace on the human mind, because they couldn’t find affinity with you. Patanjali may be very very great, but still he belongs to the same dimension. You may be a very very small thinker, and Patanjali may be a great great thinker, but you belong to the same dimension. If you make a little effort you can understand Patanjali; if you make a little effort you can practice Patanjali. Only a little effort is needed, nothing more.\nBut to understand Tilopa you have to enter into a completely unknown dimension. To understand Tilopa you have to move through a chaos. He will destroy all your conceptions, all your mathematics, all your logic, all your philosophy. He will simply destroy you completely. He will not be satisfied unless you are completely destroyed and a new being arises.\nWith Patanjali you will be modified, you will become better and better and better – and the process is infinite, you can go on for many lives becoming better and better and better. With Tilopa, in a second, you can reach to the ultimate. “Better” is not the question because he doesn’t think in degrees.\nIt is just like you are standing on top of a hill: you can take the path of the steps and one by one you go downwards to the valley, or from the valley you go to the hill, but by steps. With Tilopa you simply jump into the abyss, no steps are there; or you simply spread your wings and you start flying. With Patanjali you move in a bullock-cart, very slowly, safe, secure, no fear of any accident, the bullock- cart always in control. You can step down any moment, you can stop at any moment; nothing beyond you, you remain the master. And the dimension is horizontal: a bullock-cart moves from A to B, from B to C, from C to D, but the dimension is the same, the same plane. With Tilopa, the dimension changes: it becomes vertical; it is not from A to B, from B to C; no, it is just like an aircraft, not like a bullock-cart, not moving forward but moving upward. With Tilopa you can transcend time. With Patanjali you move in time. With Tilopa eternity is the dimension.\nYou may not be aware, but within these few ten, twelve years, a miracle has happened, and that is, new spaceships have destroyed the old time concept completely – because a new spaceship can move around the earth, within seconds it can make one circle. You may not be aware of the theoretical problem. It means a spaceship takes off from Poona, it is Sunday; then it goes around the earth – somewhere it must be Monday, somewhere it may still be Saturday; so the spaceship moves from Sunday, goes back into Saturday, jumps forward into Monday, comes back to Poona on Sunday. The whole time concept is lost. It looks absurd! You start on the sixteenth, you move into the seventeenth, and you come back on the same date, the sixteenth. And this can be done in twenty-four hours many times now. What does it mean? It means you can go backwards in time, from Sunday to Saturday, from the sixteenth to the fifteenth. You can go forward into the seventeenth, into Monday, and you can come back on the same date.\nWith speed and a different dimension, vertical, time becomes irrelevant. Time is relevant with a bullock-cart; it is a bullock-cart world. Tilopa is a vertical mind, a vertical consciousness. That is the difference between tantra and yoga: yoga is horizontal, tantra is verti cal; yoga takes millions of lives\nto reach; tantra says: within a second. Tantra says time is irrelevant, you don’t bother about time. Tantra has a technique, a method, which tantra says is a no-method, a no-technique, through which you can suddenly surrender everything and take a jump into the abyss.\nYoga is effort, tantra is effortlessness. With effort, with your tiny energy, and your tiny ego, you fight with the whole. It will take millions of lives. Then too it doesn’t seem possible that you will ever become enlightened. Fighting with the whole is stupid; you are just a part. It is as if a wave is fighting with the ocean, a leaf is fighting with the tree, or your own hand fighting with your body. With whom are you fighting?\nYoga is effort, intense effort. And yoga is a way to fight the current, to move against the current. So whatsoever is natural, yoga has to drop it; and whatsoever is unnatural, yoga has to strive for it. Yoga is the unnatural way: fight with the river and move against the current! Of course, there is challenge and the challenge may be enjoyed. But who enjoys the challenge? Your ego.\nIt is very difficult to find a yogi who is not an egoist; very difficult, rare. If you can find a yogi who is not an egoist, it is a miracle. It is difficult because the whole effort creates the ego, the fight. You may find humble yogis, but if you watch a little deeper, in their humbleness you will find the most subtle ego hidden, the most subtle ego. They will say, “We are just dirt on the ground.” But look in their eyes – they are bragging about their humility. They are saying, “There is nobody more humble than us. We are the humblest people.” But this is what ego means.\nIf you move against nature you will be strengthened in your ego – that is the challenge, that’s why people like challenges. A life without challenges becomes dull because the ego feels hungry. Ego needs food, challenge gives food – so people seek challenges. If there are no challenges, they create them; they create hurdles so that they can fight with the hurdles.\nTantra is the natural way; the loose and the natural is the goal. You need not fight with the current; simply move with it, float with it. The river is going to the sea so why fight? Move with the river, become one with the river, surrender. “Surrender” is the keyword for tantra; “will” is the keyword for yoga. Yoga is the path of will; tantra is the path of surrender.\nThat’s why tantra is the path of love – love is surrender. This is the first thing to understand, then Tilopa’s words will become very very crystal-clear. The different dimension of tantra has to be understood – the vertical dimension, the dimension of surrender, of not fighting, of being loose and natural, relaxed – what Chuang Tzu says, “Easy is right.” With yoga, difficult is right; with tantra, easy is right.\nRelax and be at ease, there is no hurry. The whole itself is taking you on its own accord. You need not make an individual striving, you are not asked to reach before your time, you will reach when the time is ripe – you simply wait. The whole is moving – why are you in a hurry? Why do you want to reach before others?\nThere is a beautiful story about Buddha: He reached the gate of heaven. Of course, the people there were waiting. They opened the door, they welcomed him, but he turned his back towards the door, looked at the samsara, the world – millions of souls on the same path, struggling, in misery, in anguish, striving to reach this gate of heaven and bliss. The doorkeeper said, “You come in please!\nWe have been waiting for you.” And Buddha said, “How can I come when others have not reached? It doesn’t seem to be the right time. How can I enter when the whole has not entered into it? I will have to wait. It is just like my hand has reached into the door, and my feet have not reached yet. I will have to wait. Just the hand cannot enter alone.”\nThis is one of the most profound insights of tantra. Tantra says nobody can become enlightened, in fact, alone. We are parts of each other, we are members of each other; we are a whole. One person may become the peak, may become a very great wave – but it remains connected with the small waves all around. It is not alone, it remains one with the ocean and all the waves there. How can a wave become enlightened alone?\nIt is said, in this beautiful story, that Buddha is still waiting. He has to wait – nobody is an island, we make a continent, we are together. I may have stepped a little further than you, but I cannot be separate. And now I know it deeply, now it is not a story for me – I am waiting for you. Now it is not just a parable, now I know that there is no individual enlightenment. Individuals can step a little ahead, that’s all, but they remain joined together with the whole.\nAnd if an enlightened person is not aware that he is part of others, one with the others, then who will know this? We move as one being, and tantra says, “So don’t be in a hurry, and don’t try, and don’t push others, and don’t try to be first in the queue – be loose and natural. Everything is going towards enlightenment. It is going to happen; don’t create an anguish about it.” If you can understand this, already you are near it; one relaxes. Otherwise, religious people become very very tense; even ordinary worldly people are not so tense as religious people become.\nOrdinary worldly people are for worldly goals; of course, tense, but not so much as religious people because they are tense for the other world, and their world is very far away, invisible, and they are always in doubt whether it is there or not. And then a new misery arises: maybe they are losing this world and the other doesn’t exist. They are always in anguish, mentally very much disturbed. Don’t become that type of religious man.\nTo me a religious man is loose and natural. He is not worried about this world or the other world. He is not worried about it at all, he simply lives and enjoys. This moment is the only moment for him, the next moment will take care of itself. When the next moment comes, he will receive it also enjoying, blissful. A religious man is not goal-oriented. To be goal-oriented is to be worldly. Your goal may be God – it makes no difference.\nTantra is really beautiful. Tantra is the highest understanding, and the greatest principle. If you cannot understand tantra, then yoga is for you. If you can understand tantra, then don’t bother about small teachings. When the great vehicle is there, why bother about small boats?\nIn Buddhism, there are two sects. The names of the sects are very very significant. One sect is known as Hinayana, the small vehicle; it is the path of yoga, a small boat: you alone can sit in it, you cannot have anybody else in it, it is so small. The yogi moves alone. Hinayana means the very small boat. And then there is another sect of Buddhists that is called Mahayana, the great boat, the great vehicle. Millions can enter into it, the whole world can be absorbed into it.\nMahayana is the path of tantra and Hinayana is the path of yoga. Tilopa is a Mahayanist, a man who believes in the great vehicle, the great principle.\nSmall boats are for egoistic people who cannot tolerate anybody else in the boat, who can only be alone, who are great condemners, who look at the other always with condemnation. “You – and trying to reach there? You cannot reach, it is very difficult, only rare persons reach.” They will not allow you to enter in the boat. Mahayana has a deep love for all. Everybody can enter. In fact, no conditions exist.\nPeople come to me and they say, “You give sannyas to everybody and anybody?” Sannyas has not been given that way ever. It is for the first time in the whole history of the world that I give sannyas without any conditions. Sannyas has been always for very egoistic people: the otherworldly, the condemners, the poisoners, who say everything is wrong, everybody is wrong, this whole life is a sin; who have a look always in their eyes of holier-than-you, you are always condemned. Hell is for you. They are great sannyasins; they have renounced the world, the world of sin and dirt and poison, and you are still in it. The great egoists have been the sannyasins.\nFor the first time I have allowed everybody, I have opened the door. In fact I have thrown the door completely. Now it cannot be closed, now anybody and everybody is welcome. Why? – because my attitude is that of tantra, it is not of yoga. I talk on Patanjali also for those who are not able to comprehend tantra; otherwise, my attitude is that of tantra – everybody is welcome. When God welcomes you, who am I...? When the whole world supports you and the existence tolerates you, not only tolerates, gives you energy and life...? Even if you are committing sin, existence never says, “No, no more energy for you. Now you cannot get any more gas. Stop! You are doing too much nonsense.” No. The energy goes on being given. There is never any gas-crisis; the existence goes on supporting you.\nIt happened: A Mohammedan mystic, Junnaid, once asked God about one of his neighbors, “This man is so evil and he is creating so much mischief for the whole village, and people come to me and they say, ‘You ask your God, pray to God, if he can get rid of this man.’” And Junnaid heard in his prayer the voice: “When I am accepting him, who are you to reject him?” And Junnaid has written in his autobiography, “Never again did I ask him such a thing, because it was really foolish of me. If he has given birth to this man, if he is still helping him to be alive, not only alive but flourishing, blooming, then who am I?”\nThe existence gives you life unconditionally. I give you sannyas unconditionally. If the existence hopes about you so infinitely that you cannot destroy its hope, who am I...?\nTantra is for all. It is not for the chosen few. It became a path for the chosen few because everybody won’t understand it, but it is not for the chosen few – it is for all; it is for everybody who is ready to take the jump.\nNow try to understand:\nIN MAHAMUDRA ALL ONE’S SINS ARE BURNED. THEY ARE NOT TO BE BALANCED BY GOOD ACTS. IN MAHAMUDRA ALL ONE’S SINS ARE BURNED.\nWhat is this Mahamudra again and again? What happens? Mahamudra is a state of your being when you are not separate from the total. Mahamudra is like a deep sexual orgasm with the whole.\nWhen two lovers are in deep sexual orgasm, they melt into each other; then the woman is no more the woman, the man is no more the man. They become just like the circle of yin and yang, reach ing into each other, meeting into each other, melting, their own identities forgotten. That’s why love is so beautiful. This state is called mudra, this state of deep orgasmic intercourse is called mudra. And the final state of orgasm with the whole is called Mahamudra, the great orgasm.\nWhat happens in orgasm, in sexual orgasm? You have to understand it because only that will give you the key for the final orgasm. What happens? When two lovers are there... and always remember: two lovers, not wife and husband, because with a wife and husband it almost never happens because wives and husbands become more and more fixed roles, they are not melting and flowing. “Husband” has become a role, “wife” has become a role. They act. The wife has to act as a wife whether she likes it or not; the husband has to act as a husband. It has become a legal thing.\nOnce I asked Mulla Nasruddin, “How many years have you been married, Nasruddin?” He said, “Twenty odd years.”\nSo I asked, “Why do you call them ‘odd’?”\nHe said, “When you will see my wife you will understand.”\nWives and husbands are social phenomena... an institution, it is not a relationship. It is an institution; it is a forced phenomenon – not for love, but other reasons: economic security, safety, children, society, culture, religion, everything else except love.\nOrgasm almost never happens between a wife and a husband – unless they are lovers also. That is possible: you can be a wife or a husband and a lover; you can love your wife. Then it is totally different, but then it is not a marriage at all, it is no more an institution.\nIn the East, because marriage has existed for thousands of years, people have completely forgotten what orgasm is. I have not come across a single Indian woman who knows what orgasm is. Some Western women, just within a few years, twenty-five years, have become aware that orgasm is something worth achieving; otherwise, women have completely forgotten that they have any possibility of orgasm within their bodies.\nThis is one of the most unfortunate things that could have happened to humanity. And when the woman cannot have an orgasm, the man cannot have it really, because an orgasm is a meeting of the two. Only two, when they melt into each other, can have it. It is not that one can have and another may not have – it is not possible. Release is possible, ejaculation is possible; relief is possible, but not orgasm. What is an orgasm?\nOrgasm is a state where your body no more is felt as matter; it vibrates like energy, electricity. It vibrates so deeply, from the very foundation, that you completely forget that it is a material thing. It becomes an electric phenomenon – and it is an electric phenomenon.\nNow physicists say that there is no matter, that all matter is only appearance; deep down, that which exists is electricity, not matter. In orgasm, you come to this deepest layer of your body where matter no more exists, just energy waves; you become a dancing energy, vibrating. No more any boundaries to you – pulsating, but no more substantial. And your beloved also pulsates.\nAnd by and by, if they love each other and they surrender to each other, they surrender to this moment of pulsation, of vibration, of being energy, and they are not scared.Because it is death-\nlike when the body loses boundaries, when the body becomes like a vaporous thing, when the body evaporates substantially and only energy is left, a very subtle rhythm, but you find yourself as if you are not. Only in deep love can one move into it. Love is like death: you die as far as your material image is concerned, you die as far as you think you are a body; you die as a body and you evolve as energy, vital energy.\nAnd when the wife and the husband, or the lovers, or the partners, start vibrating in a rhythm, their beats of their heart and body become together, it becomes a harmony – then orgasm happens, then they are no more two. That is the symbol of yin and yang: yin moving into yang, yang moving into yin; man moving into the woman, the woman moving into the man. Now they are a circle and they vibrate together, they pulsate together. Their hearts are no more separate, their beats are no more separate; they have become a melody, a harmony. It is the greatest music possible; all other musics are just faint things compared to it, shadow things compared to it.\nThis vibration of two as one is orgasm. When the same thing happens, not with another person, but with the whole existence, then it is Mahamudra, then it is the great orgasm. It happens. I would like to tell you how you can try it, so that the Mahamudra becomes possible, the great orgasm.\nIn Indonesia, there is a very rare man, Bapak Subuh. He has come unknowingly to a method known as latihan. He stumbled upon it, but latihan is one of the oldest tantra methods. It is not a new phenomenon; latihan is the first step towards Mahamudra. It is allowing the body to vibrate, allowing the body to become energy, nonsubstantial, nonmaterial; allowing the body to melt and dissolve the boundaries.\nBapak Subuh is a Mohammedan but his movement is known as “Subud.” That word is Buddhist. “Subud” comes from three words: “su,” “bu,” “dha” – “su” means sushila, “bu” means Buddha, “dha” means dharma; Subud means sushila-Buddha-dharma. The meaning is: the law of great virtue derived from Buddha, Buddha’s law of great virtue. This is what Tilopa calls the great teaching.\nLatihan is simple. It is the first step. One has to stand relaxed, loose and natural. It is good if you stand alone and nobody is there to disturb you. Close your room, stand alone. If you can find someone who has already stepped into latihan, his presence can be helpful, his very presence works like a catalytic agent, he becomes the opener. So somebody who is advanced a little already can open you very easily; otherwise, you can open yourself also. A little more time will be needed, that’s all. Otherwise an opener is good.\nIf an opener is standing just by your side, he starts his latihan: you simply stand and his energy starts pulsating with you, his energy starts moving around you, like a fragrance he surrounds you – suddenly you feel the music. Just as when there is a good singer, or somebody is playing on an instrument, you start beating your feet, or you start tapping the chair, or you start pulsating with it\n– just like that, a deep energy inside him moves and the whole room and the quality of the room is changed immediately.\nYou are not to do anything; you are simply to be there, loose and natural, just waiting for something to happen. And if your body starts moving, you have to allow it, you have just to cooperate and allow. The cooperation should not become too direct, it should not become a pushing; it should remain just an allowing. Your body starts moving suddenly, as if you are possessed, as if a great energy from the above has descended on you, as if a cloud has come and has surrounded you – and now you are possessed by that cloud, and the cloud is penetrating within your body, and your body starts taking movements. Your hands are raised, you make subtle movements, you start a small dance, soft gestures; your body is taken up.\nIf you know anything about automatic writing it will be easy to follow what happens in latihan. In automatic writing you take a pencil in your hand, you close your eyes, you wait. Suddenly you feel a jerk in the hand: your hand is possessed, as if something has entered. You are not to do anything, because if you do then it will not be from the beyond; it will be your doing. You have simply to allow. Loose and natural – Tilopa’s words are wonderful; they cannot be improved upon. Loose and natural, you wait with the pencil, with closed eyes; when the jerk comes and the hand starts moving, you have to allow it, that’s all. You have not to resist it; because you can resist. The energy is very subtle, and, in the beginning, not very powerful. If you just stop it, it can be stopped. And the energy is not aggressive; if you don’t allow, it will not come. If you doubt, it will not happen, because with doubt, your hand will be resisting. With doubt, you will not allow, you will fight. So that’s why trust is so meaningful, shraddha. You simply trust and leave your hand; by and by the hand starts moving, now the hand starts making wriggles on the paper – allow it. Then somebody simply asks a question, or you yourself ask a question; let the question be there, loose in the mind, not very persistent, not forcing; just raise the question and wait. And suddenly the answer is written.\nIf ten persons try, at least three persons will be absolutely capable of automatic writing. Thirty percent of people are not aware that they can become so receptive. And this can become a great force in your life. Explanations differ... what happens – that is not important. The deepest explanation that I find true is, your own highest center possesses your lowest center; your own highest peak of consciousness catches hold of your lowest unconscious mind. You ask and your own inner being answers. Nobody else is there, but your inner being, which you don’t know, is very superior to you.\nYour own innermost being is the possibility of your ultimate flowering. It is as if the flower takes possession of the seed and answers. The seed doesn’t know, but the flower... as if your possibility takes possession of your actuality and answers; as if your ultimate potentiality takes possession of whatsoever you are, and answers. Or the future takes possession of the past, the unknown takes possession of the known, the formless takes possession of the form – all metaphors, but I feel you will understand the significance – as if your old age takes possession of your childhood, and answers.\nThe same happens in latihan with the whole body. In automatic writing you only leave your hand loose and natural. In latihan you leave your whole body loose and you wait, and you cooperate, and suddenly you feel an urge. The hand is raising by itself, as if somebody is pulling it by some invisible strings – allow it. And the leg goes moving; you take a turn, you start a small dance; very chaotic,\nwith no rhythm, with no manipulation, but by and by, as you get deeper, it takes its own rhythm. Then it is no longer chaotic, it takes its own order, it becomes a discipline, but not forced by you. This is your highest possibility taking possession of your lowest body and moving it.\nLatihan is the first step. And, by and by, you will feel so beautiful doing it that you will feel a meeting is happening between you and the cosmos. But this is only the first step. That’s why in Subud something is missing. The first step in itself is very beautiful, but it is not the last step. I would like you to complete it. For thirty minutes at least – sixty will be wonderful; by and by from thirty you reach to sixty minutes of latihan dancing.\nIn sixty minutes your body, from pore to pore, from cell to cell, is cleansed; it is a catharsis, you are completely renewed, all the dirt is burned. That’s what Tilopa says: In Mahamudra all one’s sins are burned. The past is thrown into fire. It is a new birth, a rebirth. And you feel energy showering all over you, in and out. And the dance is not only outside. Soon, when you get attuned in it, you will feel an inner dance also. Not only that your body is dancing, inside the energy is dancing; and they both cooperate with each other. And then a pulsation happens, and you feel you are pulsating with the universe – you have found the universal rhythm.\nThirty to sixty minutes is the time: start with thirty, end with sixty. Somewhere in between you will have the right time. And you will come to know: if you feel attuned nearabout forty minutes, then that is your right time; if you feel attuned at twenty minutes, then that is your right time. Then your meditation must go beyond that: if you feel tuned at ten minutes, twenty minutes will do; if you feel tuned at fifteen minutes, thirty minutes will do. Do it double, don’t take any chances, so really you are completely cleaned. And end it with a prayer.\nWhen you are completely cleaned and feeling that your body is refreshed – you have been under a shower of energy, and your whole body is feeling one, undivided; and the substantialness of body is lost, you feel it more like an energy, a movement, a process, not material – now you are ready. Then kneel down on the earth.\nKneeling down is beautiful; just like Sufis kneel down, or Mohammedans do their prayer in the mosque, kneel down like them because that is the best posture for latihan. Then raise both your hands towards the sky with closed eyes, and feel yourself to be like a hollow vessel, hollow bamboo; inside, hollow, just like an earthen pot. Your head is the mouth of the pot, and the energy is falling tremendously on your head as if you are standing under a waterfall. And you will be actually standing – after the latihan you will feel it; it is like a waterfall, not like a shower. When you are ready it falls in greater strength, strong, and your body will start trembling, shaking, like a leaf in a strong wind; or, if you have stood under a waterfall sometime, then you will know. If you have never stood under one, go to a waterfall and stand under it and feel how it feels. That same feeling will come to you after latihan. Feel yourself hollow inside, nothing inside, just emptiness – and the energy is filling you, filling you completely.\nAllow it to fall into you as deeply as possible, so it can reach to your farthest corner of your body and mind and soul. And when you feel it – you are so much filled, and the whole body is shaking – kneel down, put your head down on the earth, and pour the energy into the earth. When you feel the energy is overflowing, pour down into the earth. Take from the sky, give it back to the earth, and you be just a hollow bamboo in between.\nThis has to be done seven times. Take from the sky and pour down into the earth and kiss the earth, and pour down – be empty completely. Pour down as completely as you did for filling, be completely empty. Then raise your hands again, fill again, pour down again. Seven times it has to be done, because each time it penetrates one chakra of the body, one center of the body; each time it goes deeper in you. And if you do less than seven times, then you will feel restless after it because the energy will be hanging somewhere in between.\nNo, it has to penetrate all the seven chakras of your body so that you become completely hollow, a passage. The energy falls from the sky and goes into the earth, you are earthed; you simply pass the energy to the earth, just like electricity. For electricity we have to put an earth wire. The energy comes from the sky and goes into the earth, you become earthed – just a vessel, a hollow bamboo passing the energy. Seven times – more you can do, but not less. And this will be a complete Mahamudra.\nIf you do it every day, soon, within three months somewhere, one day you will feel you are not there. Just the energy is pulsating with the universe – nobody is there, the ego is completely lost, the doer is not. The universe is there, and you are there, the wave pulsating with the ocean – that is Mahamudra. That is the final orgasm, the most blissful state of consciousness that is possible.\nThis is just like two lovers making love, but millionfold, and the same phenomenon multiplied by millions – because now you are making love with the whole universe. That’s why tantra is known as the yoga of sex; tantra is known as the path of love.\nIn Mahamudra all one’s sins are burned: in Mahamudra one is released from the prison of this world. This is the dharma’s supreme torch. Those who disbelieve it are fools, who ever wallow in misery and sorrow.\nAnd Tilopa is perfectly clear. He is absolutely frank. He says, “Those who disbelieve it are fools.”\nWhy call them fools? He does not call them sinners, he does not call them irreligious, he simply calls them fools – because not believing it they are missing the greatest bliss that life can give them. They are simply fools! And it cannot happen unless you trust. Unless you trust so much that you can surrender completely, it cannot happen. All bliss, all moments of bliss, happen only when you surrender. Even death becomes beautiful if you can surrender to it, then what to say about life? If you surrender, of course, life is the greatest blessing, it is a benediction. You are missing the ultimate gift because you cannot trust.\nIf you want to learn anything, learn trust – nothing else is needed. If you are miserable, nothing else will help – learn trust. If you don’t feel any meaning in life and you feel meaninglessness, nothing will help – learn trust. Trust gives meaning because trust makes you capable of allowing the whole to descend upon you.\nTHOSE WHO DISBELIEVE IT ARE FOOLS, WHO EVER WALLOW IN MISERY AND SORROW. TO STRIVE FOR LIBERATION ONE SHOULD RELY ON A GURU. WHEN YOUR MIND RECEIVES HIS BLESSING EMANCIPATION IS AT HAND.\nWhy believe in a guru? Why believe in a master? – because the unknown is very far from you. It is just a dream, a hope at the most, a wish-fulfillment.\nYou listen to me; I may talk about the bliss, but that bliss remains a word. You may desire it, but you don’t know what it is, you don’t know the taste of it. It is very very far away from you. You are deep in misery, in anguish. In your misery and anguish you may start hoping, expecting, desiring bliss, but that will not help – you need a real taste of it. Who will give it to you? Only one who has tasted it: he can become the opener. He can act like a catalytic agent. He will not do anything; just his presence, and from him the unknown flows towards you. He is just like a window. Your doors are closed? – his doors are not closed. Your windows are closed and you have forgotten how to open them? – his windows are not closed. Through his window you can have a look at the sky; through him you can have a glimpse.\nA master, a guru, is nothing but a window. One has to pass through him, one has to have a little taste – then you can also open your own windows; otherwise the whole thing remains verbal. You can read Tilopa, but unless you find Tilopa nothing will happen to you. Your mind may go on, saying, “Maybe this man is mad, in some hallucination, dreaming, a philosopher, thinking, a poet.” But how can this happen? How is it possible for you to be blissful? You have known only misery and suffering, you have known only poison. You cannot believe in elixir; you have not known it so how can you believe it?\nA master is nothing but a personified phenomenon of the total bliss. In him it is there vibrating. If you trust him, his vibrations can reach you. A master is not a teacher, he doesn’t teach you. A master is not concerned with doctrines and principles – a master is a presence. If you trust him, he is available. A master is an availability. Through him you will have the first glimpse of the divine. Then you can go on your own.\nTO STRIVE FOR LIBERATION ONE SHOULD RELY... ON A MASTER,... ON A GURU. WHEN YOUR MIND RECEIVES HIS BLESSING EMANCIPATION IS AT HAND.\nA master cannot give you emancipation, but he can bring you to the very brink of it. He cannot give you the emancipation; that has to be achieved by you, because a thing given by someone can be taken by someone else. Only that which is yours can be yours. A master cannot give you, he can only bless you – but his blessing is a vital phenomenon. Through him you can look into your own future. Through him you can be aware of your own destiny. Through him the farthest peaks come nearer, closer. Through him you start coming up, like a seed trying to sprout towards the sky. His blessing can water your seed.\nIn the East, the blessing of the master is very very significant. The West has remained completely unaware of the phenomenon. The West knows teachers, not masters. Teachers are those who teach you about truth. A master is one who gives you the taste of it. A teacher may be someone who does not know himself, he may have learned from other teachers. Seek a master. Teachers are many, masters are few.\nAnd how will you seek a master? Just move. Whenever you hear a rumor that somebody has become enlightened, go and remain available. Don’t be much of a thinker, be more of a lover – because a master is found through feeling. A teacher is found through thinking: listen to the teacher, his logical appeal will be there, his arguments. Eat the master, drink the master. Listening won’t help because he is a living phenomenon; the energy is there. If you drink and eat him, then only you will become aware of a different quality of being.\nA great receptivity is needed, a great feminine receptivity is needed to find the master. And if you are available and a living master is there, suddenly something clicks. There is nothing to do on your part – you simply be there. It is such a vital energy phenomenon that if you are available something simply clicks, you are caught. It is a love phenomenon. You cannot prove to anybody else, “I have found the master.” There is no proof. Don’t try that because anybody can bring proof against it. You have found it and you know it; you have tasted and you know it. This knowledge is of the heart, of the feeling.\nSays Tilopa:\nTO STRIVE FOR LIBERATION ONE SHOULD RELY ON A GURU. WHEN YOUR MIND RECEIVES HIS BLESSINGS EMANCIPATION IS AT HAND.\nThe very word “guru” is meaningful. The “master” doesn’t carry that significance. The master seems to be someone who has mastered a thing, gone under a long training, has become disciplined, has become a master. “Guru” is totally different.\nThe word “guru” means one who is very very heavy, a heavy cloud just waiting for your thirst to pour down; a flower heavy with perfume just waiting for your nostrils to be there and it will penetrate. The word “guru” means heavy, very heavy – heavy with energy and the unknown, heavy with the divine, heavy like a woman who is pregnant.\nA master is pregnant with God. That’s why in the East we call the guru, God itself. The West cannot understand it because they think “God” means the creator of the world. We don’t bother much about the creator here. We call the guru, God. Why? – because he is pregnant with the divine; he is heavy with the divine. He is ready to pour down; only your thirst, a thirsty earth is needed.\nHe has not mastered anything in fact; he has not gone through any training, he has not disciplined himself. It is not art that he has become a master of – no. He has lived life in its totality; not as a discipline, but natural and loose. He has not forced himself. He has been moving with the winds; he has allowed nature to have its own course. And through millions of experiences of suffering and pain and bliss and happiness he has become mature, he has become ripe. A guru is a ripe fruit just waiting to fall, heavy. If you are ready to receive, he can fall into you.\nA guru is a totally Eastern phenomenon. The West is not yet aware of it. In the West it is difficult to feel. Why go and bow down to a guru? Why put your head at his feet? Looks humiliating. But if you want to receive, you have to bow down. He is heavy, he can pour, but then you have to bow down, otherwise you won’t receive it.\nWhen a disciple with total trust bows down at the feet of his master, something is happening there which is not visible to the eyes. An energy is falling from the master, entering the disciple. Something invisible to the eyes is happening there. If you become aware you can see it also – the aura of the master, his rainbow, pouring himself down into the disciple. You will see it in fact happening.\nThe master is heavy with divine energy. And he has infinite energy now, he can pour it down to infinite disciples. He can work with millions of disciples alone. He is never exhausted because now he is connected with the whole; he has found the source of all. Through him you can also take the\njump into that abyss. Surrender towards God is difficult because you don’t know where God is. He has never given his address to anybody ever. But a guru can be found. If you ask me what a guru is, I will tell you: the guru is the address of God.\nWHEN YOUR MIND RECEIVES HIS BLESSINGS EMANCIPATION IS AT HAND.\nThen you can be certain that you have been accepted. When you can feel the master’s blessings pouring on you, showering on you like flowers, you can be certain emancipation is at hand.\nIt happened: One of Buddha’s disciples, Sariputta, one day bowed down at Buddha’s feet. Suddenly he felt the energy falling on him. He felt a sudden transformation, a mutation of his whole mind, as if he was being destroyed and created again. He cried, “No! Wait a little.” The whole assembly of Buddha’s disciples could not understand what was happening. And he said, “Wait a little – not so soon!”\nBuddha said, “But why?”\nHe said, “Then these feet will be lost to me. Wait a little. Emancipation is at hand and I would like to be with you a little longer. Don’t push me away so soon” – because once the master has blessed and the emancipation is at hand, this is the last thing:one has to say goodbye to the master. Sariputta said, “Wait!”\nSariputta became enlightened later on. Buddha told him, “Now you go. I waited enough. Now you go and spread whatsoever I have given to you, go and give it to others.”\nSariputta had to go, weeping and crying. Somebody asked, “You have become enlightened and you weep and cry?”\nHe said, “Yes, I have become enlightened – but I can throw away the bliss of enlightenment if Buddha allows me to live at his feet.”\nSuch deep gratitude – and then wherever Sariputta lived, every day in the morning he would bow down to the direction where he knew Buddha was moving. And people asked him again and again, “Why do you do this? To whom do you bow down?” He said, “Buddha is moving in the south.”\nWhen the last days of Sariputta came, he inquired, “Where is Buddha right now? – because I would like to die bowing down in that direction.” And he died bowing down in the direction where Buddha was. When the energy is received, when the final benediction comes from the master – the emancipation is at hand – one has to say goodbye.\nIn Zen, when a disciple comes to a master in Japan, he brings his mat. He unrolls his mat before the master, sits on the mat, listens to the master; every day comes, follows whatsoever he says, leaves the mat there – for years together. Then the day he receives the final blessing, he rolls up the mat again, takes the mat back, bows down, leaves the master. That mat is symbolic. Whenever a disciple rolls up the mat again, others know he has received the benediction. Now this is the final goodbye.\nALAS, ALL THINGS IN THIS WORLD ARE MEANINGLESS, THEY ARE BUT SORROW’S SEEDS. SMALL TEACHINGS LEAD TO ACTS – ONE SHOULD ONLY FOLLOW TEACHINGS THAT ARE GREAT.\nTantra is the great teaching. Small teachings tell you what to do, what not to do. They give you ten commandments: “Do this, don’t do that” – small teachings. A great teaching doesn’t give you any commandment. It is not concerned with what you do, it is concerned with what you are. Your being, your center, your consciousness – that is the only thing significant.\nSays Tilopa:\nALAS, ALL THINGS IN THIS WORLD ARE MEANINGLESS, THEY ARE BUT SORROW’S SEEDS. SMALL TEACHINGS LEAD TO ACTS – ONE SHOULD FOLLOW TEACHINGS THAT ARE GREAT.\nIn this world, everything is the seed of sorrow. But a ray of light enters into the world whenever a person becomes enlightened. In this world everything is a seed of sorrow, but a light-ray comes from the above whenever a person becomes enlightened. Follow that ray of light and you can reach to the very source of the light, the sun.\n“And remember,” says Tilopa, “don’t become a victim of small teachings.” Many are. People come to me, they say, “We are vegetarians. Will it lead us to enlightenment?” – a very small teaching. They say, “We don’t eat in the night. Will it lead us to enlightenment?” – a very small teaching. They say, “We believe in celibacy” – a very small teaching. They do many things, but one thing they never touch – that is their being. They manage their character, they try to be as sagely as possible, but the whole thing remains a decoration. A discipline from without is a decoration. It should come from within, it should spread towards the periphery from the center. It should not be forced from the periphery towards the center.\nThe great teaching is: You are already that which you can be – realize this. You are already the goal – be aware of this. This very moment your destiny can be fulfilled. For what are you waiting? Don’t believe in gradual steps – take the jump, be courageous. Only one who is courageous can follow the great teaching of tantra.\nAfraid, scared – afraid of dying, scared of losing yourself, fearful of surrender – you will become a victim of small teachings, because you can manage small teachings. Not to eat this, not to do this, you can manage; you remain in control. The great teaching is to surrender, to surrender your control and let the whole take you away wherever it would like to take. Don’t swim against the current. Leave yourself in the river, become the river – and the river is already going to the sea. This is the great teaching.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"10234","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/tantra_the_supreme_understanding/part6/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/tantra_the_supreme_understanding/>Tantra.

FROM THE PRISON OF THIS WORLD. THIS IS THE DHARMA’S SUPREME TORCH. THOSE
WHO DISBELIEVE IT ARE FOOLS, WHO EVER WALLOW IN MISERY AND SORROW.</p><p><br></p><p>TO STRIVE FOR LIBERATION ONE SHOULD RELY ON A GURU. WHEN YOUR MIND
RECEIVES HIS BLESSING EMANCIPATION IS AT HAND.</p><p><br></p><p>ALAS, ALL THINGS IN THIS WORLD ARE MEANINGLESS, THEY ARE BUT SORROW’S
SEEDS. SMALL TEACHINGS LEAD TO ACTS – ONE SHOULD ONLY FOLLOW TEACHINGS
THAT ARE GREAT.</p><p><br></p><p>Tantra believes, not in gradual development of the soul, but in
sudden enlightenment. Yoga believes in gradual development: inch by
inch, step by step, you progress towards the final.</p><p><br></p><p>Yoga is very arithmetical: for each sin that you have committed you
have to balance it by a virtuous act; your account has to be closed
completely. Without completing the account with this world, you cannot
become enlightened. It is a mathematical conception, scientific, and the
mind will say, “Of course, it has to be so. You committed sins – who is
going to suffer for them? You committed sins, you have to suffer for
them. And only through suffering can you become liberated. Evil have
been your acts; you have to balance them, you have to pay for them, and
you have to move in good acts. When the balance is complete, then only
liberation is possible; otherwise, you will have to be</p><p>thrown again and again to the earth, to be reborn, to move, to grow.”
That is the whole philosophy of transmigration, rebirth.</p><p><br></p><p>Tantra says just the opposite. Tantra is a very very poetic approach,
not arithmetical. And tantra believes in love, not in mathematics; it
believes in sudden enlightenment. And it says that small teachings teach
you about action; great teachings don’t teach you about how to act, they
teach you what to be, how to be.</p><p><br></p><p>Actions are millions, and if you have to pay for all the actions, it
seems almost impossible that you are ever going to be liberated.
Millions of lives you have lived; in each life, millions of acts you
have committed. If you are going to pay for all those acts, suffer, and
you have to balance each bad act with a good one, it will take again
millions of lives for you. And meanwhile, in the complex relationship of
life, you will be committing many more actions. So where will this chain
end? It seems impossible. Liberation becomes almost impossible – it
cannot happen. If this is the way, that inch by inch one has to grow,
then growth seems an impossible dream.</p><p><br></p><p>If you understand the attitude of yoga, you will feel very very
hopeless. Tantra is a great hope. Tantra is like an oasis in a world of
deserts.</p><p><br></p><p>Tantra says this is not the point at all: acts are not the question.
You committed them because you were ignorant, they came out of your
ignorance. In fact, tantra says you are not responsible for them. If
somebody is responsible, then the whole – you may call it God – God may
be responsible, but you cannot be responsible. Tantra says that even to
take this responsibility is very egoistic. To say, “I will have to
balance, I will have to do good acts, I will have to liberate myself
inch by inch and step by step,” this too is a very egoistic,
ego-centered attitude.</p><p><br></p><p>Why do you think you are responsible? Even if responsibility has to
be somewhere, then it has to be with the divine himself, with the whole.
You have not created yourself, you have not given birth to yourself. You
have been given birth, you have been created – then the creator must be
responsible, not you.</p><p><br></p><p>And you committed all your actions in ignorance, you were not aware
of what you were doing, you were completely drunk with ignorance. In
darkness you were groping, in darkness you came in conflict with others,
in darkness you stumbled upon things and something happened. Tantra says
the only thing that is needed is light, awareness. Not millions of acts
have to be answered; only one thing has to be done and that is: don’t
remain ignorant, become aware.</p><p><br></p><p>Once you become aware, all that belongs to the world of darkness
disappears. It will look like a dream, a nightmare. It will not look
like a reality. And it has not been a reality, because when you are deep
down unconscious, only dreams can exist, not reality. You have been
dreaming that you loved. You cannot love. You are not there to love. You
still don’t exist, you don’t have any center. How can you love? You only
believe that you love, and then your love life and the acts concerned
with it... it becomes a dream. When you will awaken out of this
dreaming, you will simply say, “How could I have loved? Impossible! I
was not there in the first place. I was nonexistential in fact.” Without
awareness, what does it mean to say, “I am”? It means nothing.</p><p><br></p><p>You are fast asleep, so deeply asleep, as if you are not there. A
person fast asleep, in a coma in the house – is he really there? There
is no distinction to be made. Whether he is there or not makes</p><p>no distinction – he is in a coma. If thieves come and rob the whole
house, will you call that man responsible who is lying down in a coma,
unconscious? Will he be responsible? Will he be asked and judged:
“Thieves came! What were you doing here?” How can you make a man
responsible who is in a coma, unconscious?</p><p><br></p><p>Tantra says in all your lives you have remained in a coma – you are
not responsible. This is the first liberation that tantra gives you. And
on the base of it, many things immediately become possible. Then you
need not wait for millions of lives – this very moment the door can
open. It is not a gradual process, it is a sudden awakening – and it has
to be so.</p><p><br></p><p>When you are fast asleep and somebody tries to wake you up, is it a
gradual process or a sudden thing? Even in ordinary sleep, is it a
gradual process or a sudden thing? Even in ordinary sleep, is it a
gradual process? Is it like this, that first you become a little awake,
then a little more, and then a little more; ten percent, twenty percent,
thirty percent, fifty percent; that way does it happen? No. Either you
are awake or you are asleep; there are no gradual steps in it. If you
have heard the man who is calling your name, you are awake, not ten
percent awake. Eyes may be closed, but if you have become aware that
somebody is calling you, you are already awake.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not a gradual process, it is a sudden jump. At one hundred
degrees, the water jumps and becomes vapor. Is there any gradual
transformation? Does the water first become ten percent, twenty percent,
thirty percent? No. Either it is water or it is vapor; there is no
middle ground to be divided.</p><p><br></p><p>When a person dies, is he dead by and by, in a gradual process? Can
you say that he is half-alive and half-dead? What will it mean? How can
a person be half-alive? Either he is dead or he is not dead. Half-alive
means he is not dead.</p><p><br></p><p>When you love a person, do you love ten percent, twenty percent,
thirty percent? Either you love or you don’t love. Is there any
possibility of dividing your love? There is no possibility.</p><p><br></p><p>Love, life, death, they all happen suddenly.</p><p><br></p><p>When a child is born, he is either born or not born. And the same is
true about enlightenment, because that is the ultimate birth, ultimate
death, ultimate life, ultimate love – everything comes to its ultimate
peak in enlightenment. It is a sudden thing.</p><p><br></p><p>Tantra says: Don’t focus your attention on the acts, focus your
attention on the person who has done the acts. Yoga focuses on the acts.
Tantra focuses on the person, on the consciousness, on you.</p><p><br></p><p>If you are ignorant, tantra says you are bound to commit sin. Even if
you try to be virtuous, your virtue will be a sort of sin – because how
can an ignorant man, fast asleep, be virtuous? How can virtue arise out
of ignorance, unconsciousness? Impossible! Your virtue must be just a
mask; behind it will be the real face, the real face of sin.</p><p><br></p><p>You may talk about love, but you cannot love – you will hate. You can
talk about compassion, but compassion must be just a covering of your
anger, greed, jealousy. Your love is poisonous. Deep inside in your love
is the worm of hate, eating it continuously. Your love is like a wound,
it hurts.</p><p>It is not like a flower, it cannot be. And those who expect love from
you are fools, they are asking the impossible. Those who ask from you
morality are fools, they are asking the impossible. Your morality is
bound to be a sort of immorality.</p><p><br></p><p>Look at your moral persons, your so-called saints. Watch and observe
them and you will find their faces are just the faces of hypocrisy,
deception. They say something, they do something else. They do
something, and they not only hide it from you – they have become so
clever in hiding, they hide it from themselves.</p><p><br></p><p>In ignorance, sin is natural. In enlightenment, virtue is natural. A
buddha cannot sin; you cannot do otherwise – you can only sin. Sin and
virtue are not your decisions, they are not your acts, they are shadows
of your being. If you awaken, then the shadow falls and the shadow is
full of light. And the shadow never harms anybody, it cannot harm; it
has a flavor of the unknown, of the immortal. It can only shower on you
like a blessing; otherwise is not possible. Even if a buddha gets angry
with you, it is compassion – it cannot be otherwise. Your compassion is
not true; Buddha’s anger cannot be true. Your sin, your natural shadow,
whatsoever you do – you can decorate it, you can make a temple on top of
it, you can hide it, you can beautify it, but that won’t help – deep
inside you will find it there, because it is not a question of what you
do, it is a question of what you are.</p><p><br></p><p>Look at the emphasis. If you understand this change of emphasis, and
this change of emphasis is a great point, only then you will be able to
understand tantra.</p><p><br></p><p>Tantra is a great teaching. It doesn’t teach about acts, it teaches
only about your being. Who you are is the point – fast asleep, snoring,
or awake? Who are you – alert, conscious, or moving in a hypnosis? Are
you a sleepwalker? or are you awake, alert, whatsoever you do? Do you do
it with self-remembrance? No. It happens – you don’t know why, from
where it comes, from what part of the unconscious comes an urge which
possesses you, and you have to act.</p><p><br></p><p>This act, whatsoever the society says about it – moral or immoral,
sin or virtue – tantra doesn’t bother about it. Tantra looks at you, at
the very center of your being from where it comes. Out of the poison of
your ignorance, life cannot come, only death. Out of your darkness, only
darkness is born. And that seems to be absolutely natural. So what to
do? Should we try to change the acts? Should we try to become more
moral, virtuous, respectable? Or should we try to change the being?</p><p><br></p><p>The being can be changed. There is no need to wait for it for
infinite lives. If you have the intensity of understanding, if you bring
your total effort, energy, being, to understand it, in that very
intensity, a light suddenly burns in you. A flame comes up from your
being like lightning, and your whole past and your whole future is
suddenly in your vision – you understand what has happened, you
understand what is happening, you understand what is going to happen.
Suddenly everything has become clear; as if it was dark and somebody
brought a light, and suddenly everything is clear.</p><p><br></p><p>Tantra believes in burning your inner light. And tantra says that
with that light, the past simply becomes irrelevant. It never belonged
to you. Of course, it happened, but happened as if in a dream and you
were fast asleep. It happened – you did many things, good and bad, but
they all happened in unconsciousness, you were not responsible. And
suddenly everything of the past is burnt down, a fresh and virgin being
comes up – this is sudden enlightenment.</p><p>Yoga appeals to people because it looks very businesslike. You can
understand Patanjali very easily because it fits with your own mind, the
logical mind, the mathematical thinking. Tilopa is difficult to
comprehend, but Tilopa is rare. Patanjali’s understanding is common –
that’s why there is so much influence of Patanjali all through
history.</p><p><br></p><p>People like Tilopa have simply disappeared without leaving any trace
on the human mind, because they couldn’t find affinity with you.
Patanjali may be very very great, but still he belongs to the same
dimension. You may be a very very small thinker, and Patanjali may be a
great great thinker, but you belong to the same dimension. If you make a
little effort you can understand Patanjali; if you make a little effort
you can practice Patanjali. Only a little effort is needed, nothing
more.</p><p><br></p><p>But to understand Tilopa you have to enter into a completely unknown
dimension. To understand Tilopa you have to move through a chaos. He
will destroy all your conceptions, all your mathematics, all your logic,
all your philosophy. He will simply destroy you completely. He will not
be satisfied unless you are completely destroyed and a new being
arises.</p><p><br></p><p>With Patanjali you will be modified, you will become better and
better and better – and the process is infinite, you can go on for many
lives becoming better and better and better. With Tilopa, in a second,
you can reach to the ultimate. “Better” is not the question because he
doesn’t think in degrees.</p><p><br></p><p>It is just like you are standing on top of a hill: you can take the
path of the steps and one by one you go downwards to the valley, or from
the valley you go to the hill, but by steps. With Tilopa you simply jump
into the abyss, no steps are there; or you simply spread your wings and
you start flying. With Patanjali you move in a bullock-cart, very
slowly, safe, secure, no fear of any accident, the bullock- cart always
in control. You can step down any moment, you can stop at any moment;
nothing beyond you, you remain the master. And the dimension is
horizontal: a bullock-cart moves from A to B, from B to C, from C to D,
but the dimension is the same, the same plane. With Tilopa, the
dimension changes: it becomes vertical; it is not from A to B, from B to
C; no, it is just like an aircraft, not like a bullock-cart, not moving
forward but moving upward. With Tilopa you can transcend time. With
Patanjali you move in time. With Tilopa eternity is the dimension.</p><p><br></p><p>You may not be aware, but within these few ten, twelve years, a
miracle has happened, and that is, new spaceships have destroyed the old
time concept completely – because a new spaceship can move around the
earth, within seconds it can make one circle. You may not be aware of
the theoretical problem. It means a spaceship takes off from Poona, it
is Sunday; then it goes around the earth – somewhere it must be Monday,
somewhere it may still be Saturday; so the spaceship moves from Sunday,
goes back into Saturday, jumps forward into Monday, comes back to Poona
on Sunday. The whole time concept is lost. It looks absurd! You start on
the sixteenth, you move into the seventeenth, and you come back on the
same date, the sixteenth. And this can be done in twenty-four hours many
times now. What does it mean? It means you can go backwards in time,
from Sunday to Saturday, from the sixteenth to the fifteenth. You can go
forward into the seventeenth, into Monday, and you can come back on the
same date.</p><p><br></p><p>With speed and a different dimension, vertical, time becomes
irrelevant. Time is relevant with a bullock-cart; it is a bullock-cart
world. Tilopa is a vertical mind, a vertical consciousness. That is the
difference between tantra and yoga: yoga is horizontal, tantra is verti
cal; yoga takes millions of lives</p><p>to reach; tantra says: within a second. Tantra says time is
irrelevant, you don’t bother about time. Tantra has a technique, a
method, which tantra says is a no-method, a no-technique, through which
you can suddenly surrender everything and take a jump into the
abyss.</p><p><br></p><p>Yoga is effort, tantra is effortlessness. With effort, with your tiny
energy, and your tiny ego, you fight with the whole. It will take
millions of lives. Then too it doesn’t seem possible that you will ever
become enlightened. Fighting with the whole is stupid; you are just a
part. It is as if a wave is fighting with the ocean, a leaf is fighting
with the tree, or your own hand fighting with your body. With whom are
you fighting?</p><p><br></p><p>Yoga is effort, intense effort. And yoga is a way to fight the
current, to move against the current. So whatsoever is natural, yoga has
to drop it; and whatsoever is unnatural, yoga has to strive for it. Yoga
is the unnatural way: fight with the river and move against the current!
Of course, there is challenge and the challenge may be enjoyed. But who
enjoys the challenge? Your ego.</p><p><br></p><p>It is very difficult to find a yogi who is not an egoist; very
difficult, rare. If you can find a yogi who is not an egoist, it is a
miracle. It is difficult because the whole effort creates the ego, the
fight. You may find humble yogis, but if you watch a little deeper, in
their humbleness you will find the most subtle ego hidden, the most
subtle ego. They will say, “We are just dirt on the ground.” But look in
their eyes – they are bragging about their humility. They are saying,
“There is nobody more humble than us. We are the humblest people.” But
this is what ego means.</p><p><br></p><p>If you move against nature you will be strengthened in your ego –
that is the challenge, that’s why people like challenges. A life without
challenges becomes dull because the ego feels hungry. Ego needs food,
challenge gives food – so people seek challenges. If there are no
challenges, they create them; they create hurdles so that they can fight
with the hurdles.</p><p><br></p><p>Tantra is the natural way; the loose and the natural is the goal. You
need not fight with the current; simply move with it, float with it. The
river is going to the sea so why fight? Move with the river, become one
with the river, surrender. “Surrender” is the keyword for tantra; “will”
is the keyword for yoga. Yoga is the path of will; tantra is the path of
surrender.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why tantra is the path of love – love is surrender. This is
the first thing to understand, then Tilopa’s words will become very very
crystal-clear. The different dimension of tantra has to be understood –
the vertical dimension, the dimension of surrender, of not fighting, of
being loose and natural, relaxed – what Chuang Tzu says, “Easy is
right.” With yoga, difficult is right; with tantra, easy is right.</p><p><br></p><p>Relax and be at ease, there is no hurry. The whole itself is taking
you on its own accord. You need not make an individual striving, you are
not asked to reach before your time, you will reach when the time is
ripe – you simply wait. The whole is moving – why are you in a hurry?
Why do you want to reach before others?</p><p><br></p><p>There is a beautiful story about Buddha: He reached the gate of
heaven. Of course, the people there were waiting. They opened the door,
they welcomed him, but he turned his back towards the door, looked at
the samsara, the world – millions of souls on the same path, struggling,
in misery, in anguish, striving to reach this gate of heaven and bliss.
The doorkeeper said, “You come in please!</p><p>We have been waiting for you.” And Buddha said, “How can I come when
others have not reached? It doesn’t seem to be the right time. How can I
enter when the whole has not entered into it? I will have to wait. It is
just like my hand has reached into the door, and my feet have not
reached yet. I will have to wait. Just the hand cannot enter alone.”</p><p><br></p><p>This is one of the most profound insights of tantra. Tantra says
nobody can become enlightened, in fact, alone. We are parts of each
other, we are members of each other; we are a whole. One person may
become the peak, may become a very great wave – but it remains connected
with the small waves all around. It is not alone, it remains one with
the ocean and all the waves there. How can a wave become enlightened
alone?</p><p><br></p><p>It is said, in this beautiful story, that Buddha is still waiting. He
has to wait – nobody is an island, we make a continent, we are together.
I may have stepped a little further than you, but I cannot be separate.
And now I know it deeply, now it is not a story for me – I am waiting
for you. Now it is not just a parable, now I know that there is no
individual enlightenment. Individuals can step a little ahead, that’s
all, but they remain joined together with the whole.</p><p><br></p><p>And if an enlightened person is not aware that he is part of others,
one with the others, then who will know this? We move as one being, and
tantra says, “So don’t be in a hurry, and don’t try, and don’t push
others, and don’t try to be first in the queue – be loose and natural.
Everything is going towards enlightenment. It is going to happen; don’t
create an anguish about it.” If you can understand this, already you are
near it; one relaxes. Otherwise, religious people become very very
tense; even ordinary worldly people are not so tense as religious people
become.</p><p><br></p><p>Ordinary worldly people are for worldly goals; of course, tense, but
not so much as religious people because they are tense for the other
world, and their world is very far away, invisible, and they are always
in doubt whether it is there or not. And then a new misery arises: maybe
they are losing this world and the other doesn’t exist. They are always
in anguish, mentally very much disturbed. Don’t become that type of
religious man.</p><p><br></p><p>To me a religious man is loose and natural. He is not worried about
this world or the other world. He is not worried about it at all, he
simply lives and enjoys. This moment is the only moment for him, the
next moment will take care of itself. When the next moment comes, he
will receive it also enjoying, blissful. A religious man is not
goal-oriented. To be goal-oriented is to be worldly. Your goal may be
God – it makes no difference.</p><p><br></p><p>Tantra is really beautiful. Tantra is the highest understanding, and
the greatest principle. If you cannot understand tantra, then yoga is
for you. If you can understand tantra, then don’t bother about small
teachings. When the great vehicle is there, why bother about small
boats?</p><p><br></p><p>In Buddhism, there are two sects. The names of the sects are very
very significant. One sect is known as Hinayana, the small vehicle; it
is the path of yoga, a small boat: you alone can sit in it, you cannot
have anybody else in it, it is so small. The yogi moves alone. Hinayana
means the very small boat. And then there is another sect of Buddhists
that is called Mahayana, the great boat, the great vehicle. Millions can
enter into it, the whole world can be absorbed into it.</p><p><br></p><p>Mahayana is the path of tantra and Hinayana is the path of yoga.
Tilopa is a Mahayanist, a man who believes in the great vehicle, the
great principle.</p><p>Small boats are for egoistic people who cannot tolerate anybody else
in the boat, who can only be alone, who are great condemners, who look
at the other always with condemnation. “You – and trying to reach there?
You cannot reach, it is very difficult, only rare persons reach.” They
will not allow you to enter in the boat. Mahayana has a deep love for
all. Everybody can enter. In fact, no conditions exist.</p><p><br></p><p>People come to me and they say, “You give sannyas to everybody and
anybody?” Sannyas has not been given that way ever. It is for the first
time in the whole history of the world that I give sannyas without any
conditions. Sannyas has been always for very egoistic people: the
otherworldly, the condemners, the poisoners, who say everything is
wrong, everybody is wrong, this whole life is a sin; who have a look
always in their eyes of holier-than-you, you are always condemned. Hell
is for you. They are great sannyasins; they have renounced the world,
the world of sin and dirt and poison, and you are still in it. The great
egoists have been the sannyasins.</p><p><br></p><p>For the first time I have allowed everybody, I have opened the door.
In fact I have thrown the door completely. Now it cannot be closed, now
anybody and everybody is welcome. Why? – because my attitude is that of
tantra, it is not of yoga. I talk on Patanjali also for those who are
not able to comprehend tantra; otherwise, my attitude is that of tantra
– everybody is welcome. When God welcomes you, who am I...? When the
whole world supports you and the existence tolerates you, not only
tolerates, gives you energy and life...? Even if you are committing sin,
existence never says, “No, no more energy for you. Now you cannot get
any more gas. Stop! You are doing too much nonsense.” No. The energy
goes on being given. There is never any gas-crisis; the existence goes
on supporting you.</p><p><br></p><p>It happened: A Mohammedan mystic, Junnaid, once asked God about one
of his neighbors, “This man is so evil and he is creating so much
mischief for the whole village, and people come to me and they say, ‘You
ask your God, pray to God, if he can get rid of this man.’” And Junnaid
heard in his prayer the voice: “When I am accepting him, who are you to
reject him?” And Junnaid has written in his autobiography, “Never again
did I ask him such a thing, because it was really foolish of me. If he
has given birth to this man, if he is still helping him to be alive, not
only alive but flourishing, blooming, then who am I?”</p><p><br></p><p>The existence gives you life unconditionally. I give you sannyas
unconditionally. If the existence hopes about you so infinitely that you
cannot destroy its hope, who am I...?</p><p><br></p><p>Tantra is for all. It is not for the chosen few. It became a path for
the chosen few because everybody won’t understand it, but it is not for
the chosen few – it is for all; it is for everybody who is ready to take
the jump.</p><p><br></p><p>Now try to understand:</p><p><br></p><p>IN MAHAMUDRA ALL ONE’S SINS ARE BURNED. THEY ARE NOT TO BE BALANCED
BY GOOD ACTS. IN MAHAMUDRA ALL ONE’S SINS ARE BURNED.</p><p>What is this Mahamudra again and again? What happens? Mahamudra is a
state of your being when you are not separate from the total. Mahamudra
is like a deep sexual orgasm with the whole.</p><p><br></p><p>When two lovers are in deep sexual orgasm, they melt into each other;
then the woman is no more the woman, the man is no more the man. They
become just like the circle of yin and yang, reach ing into each other,
meeting into each other, melting, their own identities forgotten. That’s
why love is so beautiful. This state is called mudra, this state of deep
orgasmic intercourse is called mudra. And the final state of orgasm with
the whole is called Mahamudra, the great orgasm.</p><p><br></p><p>What happens in orgasm, in sexual orgasm? You have to understand it
because only that will give you the key for the final orgasm. What
happens? When two lovers are there... and always remember: two lovers,
not wife and husband, because with a wife and husband it almost never
happens because wives and husbands become more and more fixed roles,
they are not melting and flowing. “Husband” has become a role, “wife”
has become a role. They act. The wife has to act as a wife whether she
likes it or not; the husband has to act as a husband. It has become a
legal thing.</p><p><br></p><p>Once I asked Mulla Nasruddin, “How many years have you been married,
Nasruddin?” He said, “Twenty odd years.”</p><p>So I asked, “Why do you call them ‘odd’?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “When you will see my wife you will understand.”</p><p><br></p><p>Wives and husbands are social phenomena... an institution, it is not
a relationship. It is an institution; it is a forced phenomenon – not
for love, but other reasons: economic security, safety, children,
society, culture, religion, everything else except love.</p><p><br></p><p>Orgasm almost never happens between a wife and a husband – unless
they are lovers also. That is possible: you can be a wife or a husband
and a lover; you can love your wife. Then it is totally different, but
then it is not a marriage at all, it is no more an institution.</p><p><br></p><p>In the East, because marriage has existed for thousands of years,
people have completely forgotten what orgasm is. I have not come across
a single Indian woman who knows what orgasm is. Some Western women, just
within a few years, twenty-five years, have become aware that orgasm is
something worth achieving; otherwise, women have completely forgotten
that they have any possibility of orgasm within their bodies.</p><p><br></p><p>This is one of the most unfortunate things that could have happened
to humanity. And when the woman cannot have an orgasm, the man cannot
have it really, because an orgasm is a meeting of the two. Only two,
when they melt into each other, can have it. It is not that one can have
and another may not have – it is not possible. Release is possible,
ejaculation is possible; relief is possible, but not orgasm. What is an
orgasm?</p><p><br></p><p>Orgasm is a state where your body no more is felt as matter; it
vibrates like energy, electricity. It vibrates so deeply, from the very
foundation, that you completely forget that it is a material thing. It
becomes an electric phenomenon – and it is an electric phenomenon.</p><p>Now physicists say that there is no matter, that all matter is only
appearance; deep down, that which exists is electricity, not matter. In
orgasm, you come to this deepest layer of your body where matter no more
exists, just energy waves; you become a dancing energy, vibrating. No
more any boundaries to you – pulsating, but no more substantial. And
your beloved also pulsates.</p><p><br></p><p>And by and by, if they love each other and they surrender to each
other, they surrender to this moment of pulsation, of vibration, of
being energy, and they are not scared.<span class=s4></span>Because it
is death-</p><p>like when the body loses boundaries, when the body becomes like a
vaporous thing, when the body evaporates substantially and only energy
is left, a very subtle rhythm, but you find yourself as if you are not.
Only in deep love can one move into it. Love is like death: you die as
far as your material image is concerned, you die as far as you think you
are a body; you die as a body and you evolve as energy, vital
energy.</p><p><br></p><p>And when the wife and the husband, or the lovers, or the partners,
start vibrating in a rhythm, their beats of their heart and body become
together, it becomes a harmony – then orgasm happens, then they are no
more two. That is the symbol of yin and yang: yin moving into yang, yang
moving into yin; man moving into the woman, the woman moving into the
man. Now they are a circle and they vibrate together, they pulsate
together. Their hearts are no more separate, their beats are no more
separate; they have become a melody, a harmony. It is the greatest music
possible; all other musics are just faint things compared to it, shadow
things compared to it.</p><p><br></p><p>This vibration of two as one is orgasm. When the same thing happens,
not with another person, but with the whole existence, then it is
Mahamudra, then it is the great orgasm. It happens. I would like to tell
you how you can try it, so that the Mahamudra becomes possible, the
great orgasm.</p><p><br></p><p>In Indonesia, there is a very rare man, Bapak Subuh. He has come
unknowingly to a method known as latihan. He stumbled upon it, but
latihan is one of the oldest tantra methods. It is not a new phenomenon;
latihan is the first step towards Mahamudra. It is allowing the body to
vibrate, allowing the body to become energy, nonsubstantial,
nonmaterial; allowing the body to melt and dissolve the boundaries.</p><p><br></p><p>Bapak Subuh is a Mohammedan but his movement is known as “Subud.”
That word is Buddhist. “Subud” comes from three words: “su,” “bu,” “dha”
– “su” means sushila, “bu” means Buddha, “dha” means dharma; Subud means
sushila-Buddha-dharma. The meaning is: the law of great virtue derived
from Buddha, Buddha’s law of great virtue. This is what Tilopa calls the
great teaching.</p><p><br></p><p>Latihan is simple. It is the first step. One has to stand relaxed,
loose and natural. It is good if you stand alone and nobody is there to
disturb you. Close your room, stand alone. If you can find someone who
has already stepped into latihan, his presence can be helpful, his very
presence works like a catalytic agent, he becomes the opener. So
somebody who is advanced a little already can open you very easily;
otherwise, you can open yourself also. A little more time will be
needed, that’s all. Otherwise an opener is good.</p><p><br></p><p>If an opener is standing just by your side, he starts his latihan:
you simply stand and his energy starts pulsating with you, his energy
starts moving around you, like a fragrance he surrounds you – suddenly
you feel the music. Just as when there is a good singer, or somebody is
playing on an instrument, you start beating your feet, or you start
tapping the chair, or you start pulsating with it</p><p>– just like that, a deep energy inside him moves and the whole room
and the quality of the room is changed immediately.</p><p><br></p><p>You are not to do anything; you are simply to be there, loose and
natural, just waiting for something to happen. And if your body starts
moving, you have to allow it, you have just to cooperate and allow. The
cooperation should not become too direct, it should not become a
pushing; it should remain just an allowing. Your body starts moving
suddenly, as if you are possessed, as if a great energy from the above
has descended on you, as if a cloud has come and has surrounded you –
and now you are possessed by that cloud, and the cloud is penetrating
within your body, and your body starts taking movements. Your hands are
raised, you make subtle movements, you start a small dance, soft
gestures; your body is taken up.</p><p><br></p><p>If you know anything about automatic writing it will be easy to
follow what happens in latihan. In automatic writing you take a pencil
in your hand, you close your eyes, you wait. Suddenly you feel a jerk in
the hand: your hand is possessed, as if something has entered. You are
not to do anything, because if you do then it will not be from the
beyond; it will be your doing. You have simply to allow. Loose and
natural – Tilopa’s words are wonderful; they cannot be improved upon.
Loose and natural, you wait with the pencil, with closed eyes; when the
jerk comes and the hand starts moving, you have to allow it, that’s all.
You have not to resist it; because you can resist. The energy is very
subtle, and, in the beginning, not very powerful. If you just stop it,
it can be stopped. And the energy is not aggressive; if you don’t allow,
it will not come. If you doubt, it will not happen, because with doubt,
your hand will be resisting. With doubt, you will not allow, you will
fight. So that’s why trust is so meaningful, shraddha. You simply trust
and leave your hand; by and by the hand starts moving, now the hand
starts making wriggles on the paper – allow it. Then somebody simply
asks a question, or you yourself ask a question; let the question be
there, loose in the mind, not very persistent, not forcing; just raise
the question and wait. And suddenly the answer is written.</p><p><br></p><p>If ten persons try, at least three persons will be absolutely capable
of automatic writing. Thirty percent of people are not aware that they
can become so receptive. And this can become a great force in your life.
Explanations differ... what happens – that is not important. The deepest
explanation that I find true is, your own highest center possesses your
lowest center; your own highest peak of consciousness catches hold of
your lowest unconscious mind. You ask and your own inner being answers.
Nobody else is there, but your inner being, which you don’t know, is
very superior to you.</p><p><br></p><p>Your own innermost being is the possibility of your ultimate
flowering. It is as if the flower takes possession of the seed and
answers. The seed doesn’t know, but the flower... as if your possibility
takes possession of your actuality and answers; as if your ultimate
potentiality takes possession of whatsoever you are, and answers. Or the
future takes possession of the past, the unknown takes possession of the
known, the formless takes possession of the form – all metaphors, but I
feel you will understand the significance – as if your old age takes
possession of your childhood, and answers.</p><p><br></p><p>The same happens in latihan with the whole body. In automatic writing
you only leave your hand loose and natural. In latihan you leave your
whole body loose and you wait, and you cooperate, and suddenly you feel
an urge. The hand is raising by itself, as if somebody is pulling it by
some invisible strings – allow it. And the leg goes moving; you take a
turn, you start a small dance; very chaotic,</p><p>with no rhythm, with no manipulation, but by and by, as you get
deeper, it takes its own rhythm. Then it is no longer chaotic, it takes
its own order, it becomes a discipline, but not forced by you. This is
your highest possibility taking possession of your lowest body and
moving it.</p><p><br></p><p>Latihan is the first step. And, by and by, you will feel so beautiful
doing it that you will feel a meeting is happening between you and the
cosmos. But this is only the first step. That’s why in Subud something
is missing. The first step in itself is very beautiful, but it is not
the last step. I would like you to complete it. For thirty minutes at
least – sixty will be wonderful; by and by from thirty you reach to
sixty minutes of latihan dancing.</p><p><br></p><p>In sixty minutes your body, from pore to pore, from cell to cell, is
cleansed; it is a catharsis, you are completely renewed, all the dirt is
burned. That’s what Tilopa says: In Mahamudra all one’s sins are burned.
The past is thrown into fire. It is a new birth, a rebirth. And you feel
energy showering all over you, in and out. And the dance is not only
outside. Soon, when you get attuned in it, you will feel an inner dance
also. Not only that your body is dancing, inside the energy is dancing;
and they both cooperate with each other. And then a pulsation happens,
and you feel you are pulsating with the universe – you have found the
universal rhythm.</p><p><br></p><p>Thirty to sixty minutes is the time: start with thirty, end with
sixty. Somewhere in between you will have the right time. And you will
come to know: if you feel attuned nearabout forty minutes, then that is
your right time; if you feel attuned at twenty minutes, then that is
your right time. Then your meditation must go beyond that: if you feel
tuned at ten minutes, twenty minutes will do; if you feel tuned at
fifteen minutes, thirty minutes will do. Do it double, don’t take any
chances, so really you are completely cleaned. And end it with a
prayer.</p><p><br></p><p>When you are completely cleaned and feeling that your body is
refreshed – you have been under a shower of energy, and your whole body
is feeling one, undivided; and the substantialness of body is lost, you
feel it more like an energy, a movement, a process, not material – now
you are ready. Then kneel down on the earth.</p><p><br></p><p>Kneeling down is beautiful; just like Sufis kneel down, or
Mohammedans do their prayer in the mosque, kneel down like them because
that is the best posture for latihan. Then raise both your hands towards
the sky with closed eyes, and feel yourself to be like a hollow vessel,
hollow bamboo; inside, hollow, just like an earthen pot. Your head is
the mouth of the pot, and the energy is falling tremendously on your
head as if you are standing under a waterfall. And you will be actually
standing – after the latihan you will feel it; it is like a waterfall,
not like a shower. When you are ready it falls in greater strength,
strong, and your body will start trembling, shaking, like a leaf in a
strong wind; or, if you have stood under a waterfall sometime, then you
will know. If you have never stood under one, go to a waterfall and
stand under it and feel how it feels. That same feeling will come to you
after latihan. Feel yourself hollow inside, nothing inside, just
emptiness – and the energy is filling you, filling you completely.</p><p><br></p><p>Allow it to fall into you as deeply as possible, so it can reach to
your farthest corner of your body and mind and soul. And when you feel
it – you are so much filled, and the whole body is shaking – kneel down,
put your head down on the earth, and pour the energy into the earth.
When you feel the energy is overflowing, pour down into the earth. Take
from the sky, give it back to the earth, and you be just a hollow bamboo
in between.</p><p>This has to be done seven times. Take from the sky and pour down into
the earth and kiss the earth, and pour down – be empty completely. Pour
down as completely as you did for filling, be completely empty. Then
raise your hands again, fill again, pour down again. Seven times it has
to be done, because each time it penetrates one chakra of the body, one
center of the body; each time it goes deeper in you. And if you do less
than seven times, then you will feel restless after it because the
energy will be hanging somewhere in between.</p><p><br></p><p>No, it has to penetrate all the seven chakras of your body so that
you become completely hollow, a passage. The energy falls from the sky
and goes into the earth, you are earthed; you simply pass the energy to
the earth, just like electricity. For electricity we have to put an
earth wire. The energy comes from the sky and goes into the earth, you
become earthed – just a vessel, a hollow bamboo passing the energy.
Seven times – more you can do, but not less. And this will be a complete
Mahamudra.</p><p><br></p><p>If you do it every day, soon, within three months somewhere, one day
you will feel you are not there. Just the energy is pulsating with the
universe – nobody is there, the ego is completely lost, the doer is not.
The universe is there, and you are there, the wave pulsating with the
ocean – that is Mahamudra. That is the final orgasm, the most blissful
state of consciousness that is possible.</p><p><br></p><p>This is just like two lovers making love, but millionfold, and the
same phenomenon multiplied by millions – because now you are making love
with the whole universe. That’s why tantra is known as the yoga of sex;
tantra is known as the path of love.</p><p><br></p><p>In Mahamudra all one’s sins are burned: in Mahamudra one is released
from the prison of this world. This is the dharma’s supreme torch. Those
who disbelieve it are fools, who ever wallow in misery and sorrow.</p><p><br></p><p>And Tilopa is perfectly clear. He is absolutely frank. He says,
“Those who disbelieve it are fools.”</p><p><br></p><p>Why call them fools? He does not call them sinners, he does not call
them irreligious, he simply calls them fools – because not believing it
they are missing the greatest bliss that life can give them. They are
simply fools! And it cannot happen unless you trust. Unless you trust so
much that you can surrender completely, it cannot happen. All bliss, all
moments of bliss, happen only when you surrender. Even death becomes
beautiful if you can surrender to it, then what to say about life? If
you surrender, of course, life is the greatest blessing, it is a
benediction. You are missing the ultimate gift because you cannot
trust.</p><p><br></p><p>If you want to learn anything, learn trust – nothing else is needed.
If you are miserable, nothing else will help – learn trust. If you don’t
feel any meaning in life and you feel meaninglessness, nothing will help
– learn trust. Trust gives meaning because trust makes you capable of
allowing the whole to descend upon you.</p><p><br></p><p>THOSE WHO DISBELIEVE IT ARE FOOLS, WHO EVER WALLOW IN MISERY AND
SORROW. TO STRIVE FOR LIBERATION ONE SHOULD RELY ON A GURU. WHEN YOUR
MIND RECEIVES HIS BLESSING EMANCIPATION IS AT HAND.</p><p><br></p><p>Why believe in a guru? Why believe in a master? – because the unknown
is very far from you. It is just a dream, a hope at the most, a
wish-fulfillment.</p><p>You listen to me; I may talk about the bliss, but that bliss remains
a word. You may desire it, but you don’t know what it is, you don’t know
the taste of it. It is very very far away from you. You are deep in
misery, in anguish. In your misery and anguish you may start hoping,
expecting, desiring bliss, but that will not help – you need a real
taste of it. Who will give it to you? Only one who has tasted it: he can
become the opener. He can act like a catalytic agent. He will not do
anything; just his presence, and from him the unknown flows towards you.
He is just like a window. Your doors are closed? – his doors are not
closed. Your windows are closed and you have forgotten how to open them?
– his windows are not closed. Through his window you can have a look at
the sky; through him you can have a glimpse.</p><p><br></p><p>A master, a guru, is nothing but a window. One has to pass through
him, one has to have a little taste – then you can also open your own
windows; otherwise the whole thing remains verbal. You can read Tilopa,
but unless you find Tilopa nothing will happen to you. Your mind may go
on, saying, “Maybe this man is mad, in some hallucination, dreaming, a
philosopher, thinking, a poet.” But how can this happen? How is it
possible for you to be blissful? You have known only misery and
suffering, you have known only poison. You cannot believe in elixir; you
have not known it so how can you believe it?</p><p><br></p><p>A master is nothing but a personified phenomenon of the total bliss.
In him it is there vibrating. If you trust him, his vibrations can reach
you. A master is not a teacher, he doesn’t teach you. A master is not
concerned with doctrines and principles – a master is a presence. If you
trust him, he is available. A master is an availability. Through him you
will have the first glimpse of the divine. Then you can go on your
own.</p><p><br></p><p>TO STRIVE FOR LIBERATION ONE SHOULD RELY... ON A MASTER,... ON A
GURU. WHEN YOUR MIND RECEIVES HIS BLESSING EMANCIPATION IS AT HAND.</p><p><br></p><p>A master cannot give you emancipation, but he can bring you to the
very brink of it. He cannot give you the emancipation; that has to be
achieved by you, because a thing given by someone can be taken by
someone else. Only that which is yours can be yours. A master cannot
give you, he can only bless you – but his blessing is a vital
phenomenon. Through him you can look into your own future. Through him
you can be aware of your own destiny. Through him the farthest peaks
come nearer, closer. Through him you start coming up, like a seed trying
to sprout towards the sky. His blessing can water your seed.</p><p><br></p><p>In the East, the blessing of the master is very very significant. The
West has remained completely unaware of the phenomenon. The West knows
teachers, not masters. Teachers are those who teach you about truth. A
master is one who gives you the taste of it. A teacher may be someone
who does not know himself, he may have learned from other teachers. Seek
a master. Teachers are many, masters are few.</p><p><br></p><p>And how will you seek a master? Just move. Whenever you hear a rumor
that somebody has become enlightened, go and remain available. Don’t be
much of a thinker, be more of a lover – because a master is found
through feeling. A teacher is found through thinking: listen to the
teacher, his logical appeal will be there, his arguments. Eat the
master, drink the master. Listening won’t help because he is a living
phenomenon; the energy is there. If you drink and eat him, then only you
will become aware of a different quality of being.</p><p>A great receptivity is needed, a great feminine receptivity is needed
to find the master. And if you are available and a living master is
there, suddenly something clicks. There is nothing to do on your part –
you simply be there. It is such a vital energy phenomenon that if you
are available something simply clicks, you are caught. It is a love
phenomenon. You cannot prove to anybody else, “I have found the master.”
There is no proof. Don’t try that because anybody can bring proof
against it. You have found it and you know it; you have tasted and you
know it. This knowledge is of the heart, of the feeling.</p><p><br></p><p>Says Tilopa:</p><p><br></p><p>TO STRIVE FOR LIBERATION ONE SHOULD RELY ON A GURU. WHEN YOUR MIND
RECEIVES HIS BLESSINGS EMANCIPATION IS AT HAND.</p><p><br></p><p>The very word “guru” is meaningful. The “master” doesn’t carry that
significance. The master seems to be someone who has mastered a thing,
gone under a long training, has become disciplined, has become a master.
“Guru” is totally different.</p><p><br></p><p>The word “guru” means one who is very very heavy, a heavy cloud just
waiting for your thirst to pour down; a flower heavy with perfume just
waiting for your nostrils to be there and it will penetrate. The word
“guru” means heavy, very heavy – heavy with energy and the unknown,
heavy with the divine, heavy like a woman who is pregnant.</p><p><br></p><p>A master is pregnant with God. That’s why in the East we call the
guru, God itself. The West cannot understand it because they think “God”
means the creator of the world. We don’t bother much about the creator
here. We call the guru, God. Why? – because he is pregnant with the
divine; he is heavy with the divine. He is ready to pour down; only your
thirst, a thirsty earth is needed.</p><p><br></p><p>He has not mastered anything in fact; he has not gone through any
training, he has not disciplined himself. It is not art that he has
become a master of – no. He has lived life in its totality; not as a
discipline, but natural and loose. He has not forced himself. He has
been moving with the winds; he has allowed nature to have its own
course. And through millions of experiences of suffering and pain and
bliss and happiness he has become mature, he has become ripe. A guru is
a ripe fruit just waiting to fall, heavy. If you are ready to receive,
he can fall into you.</p><p><br></p><p>A guru is a totally Eastern phenomenon. The West is not yet aware of
it. In the West it is difficult to feel. Why go and bow down to a guru?
Why put your head at his feet? Looks humiliating. But if you want to
receive, you have to bow down. He is heavy, he can pour, but then you
have to bow down, otherwise you won’t receive it.</p><p><br></p><p>When a disciple with total trust bows down at the feet of his master,
something is happening there which is not visible to the eyes. An energy
is falling from the master, entering the disciple. Something invisible
to the eyes is happening there. If you become aware you can see it also
– the aura of the master, his rainbow, pouring himself down into the
disciple. You will see it in fact happening.</p><p><br></p><p>The master is heavy with divine energy. And he has infinite energy
now, he can pour it down to infinite disciples. He can work with
millions of disciples alone. He is never exhausted because now he is
connected with the whole; he has found the source of all. Through him
you can also take the</p><p>jump into that abyss. Surrender towards God is difficult because you
don’t know where God is. He has never given his address to anybody ever.
But a guru can be found. If you ask me what a guru is, I will tell you:
the guru is the address of God.</p><p><br></p><p>WHEN YOUR MIND RECEIVES HIS BLESSINGS EMANCIPATION IS AT HAND.</p><p><br></p><p>Then you can be certain that you have been accepted. When you can
feel the master’s blessings pouring on you, showering on you like
flowers, you can be certain emancipation is at hand.</p><p><br></p><p>It happened: One of Buddha’s disciples, Sariputta, one day bowed down
at Buddha’s feet. Suddenly he felt the energy falling on him. He felt a
sudden transformation, a mutation of his whole mind, as if he was being
destroyed and created again. He cried, “No! Wait a little.” The whole
assembly of Buddha’s disciples could not understand what was happening.
And he said, “Wait a little – not so soon!”</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha said, “But why?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Then these feet will be lost to me. Wait a little.
Emancipation is at hand and I would like to be with you a little longer.
Don’t push me away so soon” – because once the master has blessed and
the emancipation is at hand, this is the last thing:one has to say
goodbye to the master. Sariputta said, “Wait!”</p><p><br></p><p>Sariputta became enlightened later on. Buddha told him, “Now you go.
I waited enough. Now you go and spread whatsoever I have given to you,
go and give it to others.”</p><p><br></p><p>Sariputta had to go, weeping and crying. Somebody asked, “You have
become enlightened and you weep and cry?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Yes, I have become enlightened – but I can throw away the
bliss of enlightenment if Buddha allows me to live at his feet.”</p><p><br></p><p>Such deep gratitude – and then wherever Sariputta lived, every day in
the morning he would bow down to the direction where he knew Buddha was
moving. And people asked him again and again, “Why do you do this? To
whom do you bow down?” He said, “Buddha is moving in the south.”</p><p><br></p><p>When the last days of Sariputta came, he inquired, “Where is Buddha
right now? – because I would like to die bowing down in that direction.”
And he died bowing down in the direction where Buddha was. When the
energy is received, when the final benediction comes from the master –
the emancipation is at hand – one has to say goodbye.</p><p><br></p><p>In Zen, when a disciple comes to a master in Japan, he brings his
mat. He unrolls his mat before the master, sits on the mat, listens to
the master; every day comes, follows whatsoever he says, leaves the mat
there – for years together. Then the day he receives the final blessing,
he rolls up the mat again, takes the mat back, bows down, leaves the
master. That mat is symbolic. Whenever a disciple rolls up the mat
again, others know he has received the benediction. Now this is the
final goodbye.</p><p>ALAS, ALL THINGS IN THIS WORLD ARE MEANINGLESS, THEY ARE BUT SORROW’S
SEEDS. SMALL TEACHINGS LEAD TO ACTS – ONE SHOULD ONLY FOLLOW TEACHINGS
THAT ARE GREAT.</p><p><br></p><p>Tantra is the great teaching. Small teachings tell you what to do,
what not to do. They give you ten commandments: “Do this, don’t do that”
– small teachings. A great teaching doesn’t give you any commandment. It
is not concerned with what you do, it is concerned with what you are.
Your being, your center, your consciousness – that is the only thing
significant.</p><p><br></p><p>Says Tilopa:</p><p><br></p><p>ALAS, ALL THINGS IN THIS WORLD ARE MEANINGLESS, THEY ARE BUT SORROW’S
SEEDS. SMALL TEACHINGS LEAD TO ACTS – ONE SHOULD FOLLOW TEACHINGS THAT
ARE GREAT.</p><p><br></p><p>In this world, everything is the seed of sorrow. But a ray of light
enters into the world whenever a person becomes enlightened. In this
world everything is a seed of sorrow, but a light-ray comes from the
above whenever a person becomes enlightened. Follow that ray of light
and you can reach to the very source of the light, the sun.</p><p><br></p><p>“And remember,” says Tilopa, “don’t become a victim of small
teachings.” Many are. People come to me, they say, “We are vegetarians.
Will it lead us to enlightenment?” – a very small teaching. They say,
“We don’t eat in the night. Will it lead us to enlightenment?” – a very
small teaching. They say, “We believe in celibacy” – a very small
teaching. They do many things, but one thing they never touch – that is
their being. They manage their character, they try to be as sagely as
possible, but the whole thing remains a decoration. A discipline from
without is a decoration. It should come from within, it should spread
towards the periphery from the center. It should not be forced from the
periphery towards the center.</p><p><br></p><p>The great teaching is: You are already that which you can be –
realize this. You are already the goal – be aware of this. This very
moment your destiny can be fulfilled. For what are you waiting? Don’t
believe in gradual steps – take the jump, be courageous. Only one who is
courageous can follow the great teaching of tantra.</p><p><br></p><p>Afraid, scared – afraid of dying, scared of losing yourself, fearful
of surrender – you will become a victim of small teachings, because you
can manage small teachings. Not to eat this, not to do this, you can
manage; you remain in control. The great teaching is to surrender, to
surrender your control and let the whole take you away wherever it would
like to take. Don’t swim against the current. Leave yourself in the
river, become the river – and the river is already going to the sea.
This is the great teaching.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part5>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

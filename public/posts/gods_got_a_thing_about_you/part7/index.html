Existence is constituted of that sound of silence.

There is a sound of silence, and once it is heard then one has heard all. That is the fundamental of existence. Existence is constituted of that sound of silence. The Bible calls it “the word,” “logos,” and the Zen people call it “the sound of one hand clapping.” Now, there is no possibility of one hand clapping and creating a sound. It simply says, indicates, the paradox: when one falls utterly silent inside then a music is heard. That music is not constituted of any sound – it is soundless – still it is music. It is the greatest mystery that one can come to. In the East it is represented by the word “aum.” It does not mean anything. It is simply a symbol for that soundless sound.\nOne has to become more and more quiet, thoughtless, because the music is there but we are so enveloped by the noise of our own minds that we cannot hear it. This constant inner talk has to stop and then suddenly that soundless sound explodes in you. And that is a great ecstatic experience – incomparable, unique; there is nothing like it. And once it has happened, you become it. Then you can live in the marketplace but you are not there. You can act in a thousand and one ways but you remain inactive. You can get involved in every kind of situation yet you are a witness. And that’s the beauty. The most important thing in life is to attain it; then the whole of life is just a drama.\nOne plays but one is not worried. One lives moment to moment and one has no will of one’s own. Then God’s will is fulfilled. That’s what Jesus means when he says: “Thy will be done, thy kingdom come.” But for his kingdom to come we have to disappear utterly as a noisy place. And that’s what meditation is all about. The whole effort here is to bring your mind to such a stop that you can hear your own innermost core – the still, small voice of the heart.\n[The new sannyasin asks: Why is it so difficult to love?]\nBecause we have been brought up not to love. Our whole conditioning is against love, and the conditioning is great – twenty years of conditioning, twenty-five years of conditioning. You will have\nto drop that conditioning, then love will arise. Love is our nature, so even though the conditioning is deep we still hanker for it. It is like a hungry man who has been hypnotized and told in hypnosis for twenty years continuously, “You are not hungry.” That will be the situation for him: he will feel hunger and still his mind will deny it. His mind will say, “You are not hungry... because of those twenty years of conditioning, of constant suggestion, mind-wash.\nAnd the society up to now has existed on the foundation of hate, violence, aggression; it is afraid of love. And once love explodes in the world this so-called society is going to disappear, so there is going to be a great clash.\nFor example a loving person cannot be persuaded to go to war; it is impossible. The different states cannot exist if the person is loving, because where will they find their armies? From where will Adolf Hitler find his Nazis and Mussolini his fascists? From where? It will be impossible. Everybody has to be so starved of love that love goes sour and becomes hate. Then one is just boiling within; everybody is just a volcano, ready to explode at any excuse. That’s why every ten years we need a great war. That is a catharsis: it helps people to relieve themselves of all the anger, all the hatred, that they have accumulated.\nLove is the right direction for your life. If the right direction is not given, then love itself turns into hate. Hate is nothing but love standing on its head, upside down.\nNow just think: if the whole world is loving, the states cannot exist, India cannot exist, Germany cannot exist, England cannot exist, America cannot exist, China, Soviet Russia... none of these can exist, because then people will be so loving that they will see the whole stupidity of war. “Why should we fight? Why should we kill each other? We can make this earth a paradise.”\nAnd the energy that we put into war is tremendous. Almost ninety percent of human energy is being wasted in war. War has been our constant history – chronic. In three thousand years man has fought five thousand wars. The earth seems to be mad! – as if we are here only to fight and kill each other and murder each other.\nNow, this kind of world cannot allow love to grow. It depends on hate. The politician cannot allow love to happen. The priest cannot allow love to happen. If the priest allows love to happen then how will you manage your crusades and holy wars? If love is allowed, love will not know the distinction between a Christian and a Hindu and a Mohammedan. Love will not know the distinction between a Jew and a Jaina. Love knows no distinctions. Churches will start disappearing. Churches can exist only if hate exists.\nNow this is very strange: all the churches talk about love and all the churches create hate in the world. The history of religion is more bloody than the history of anything else. And there is a biological reason also for how it all started, because the question arises: if man is by nature loving, then why did he manage such a kind of society in the very beginning? It was a question of survival. We have forgotten all those days, but five thousand years back man was constantly afraid of being killed by the animals. He was in constant fear. He had to fight back; to survive he had to constantly kill.\nNow all those days are gone – there is no need to kill. In fact, there are not any animals left to kill. Now we are trying to protect them, whatsoever is left. But the old habit persisted. First we\nwere fighting with animals, for centuries, for millennia; then it became an instinct – fighting. Then we started fighting with people, tribes, nations, ideologies, religions. The fight Continues – we only change the labels.\nBut my understanding is that now the future is not going to follow this past. A great revolution is on the way. And this will be the revolution – that man will start loving and will drop all the nonsense that comes as a hindrance to love; and there are a thousand and one kinds of hindrances.\nThis is my problem. Because I teach love the government is against me, the politicians are against me, the priests are against me. And I am not teaching people to murder each other. I am simply teaching people to be more loving. Why are they so against it?\nTheir very foundation is based on hatred. They hide it. They write in big letters: “Love is God” – but behind it are only bayonets, atomic bombs, hydrogen bombs, super bombs – piles upon piles. Man has accumulated so many bombs that we can kill each person seven times. Now this is futile. One person is killed in one go; there is no need to kill him seven times. But just in case one might survive... we will not allow him to. And this goes on! Each country goes on giving the major proportion of its wealth to war – even a country like India which talks about nonviolence, which talks about great ideals, Mahatma Gandhi, et cetera. But seventy percent of the wealth of the country goes into war efforts – and a poor country, starving! But that is not the point: war has to be looked to first. You can die starving, that’s okay, but we have to make bombs!\nThis is an utterly neurotic world in which we are living. So unless you become very alert and drop all the conditionings that your society has given to you, you will not be able to love. And all these groups that are being run here are basically meant for that. So in some groups I even allow fighting. Anger has to be expressed. It has to be vomited out, because if you don’t vomit it out, it will remain in your system, it will poison you. Now that becomes a problem.\nPeople go on asking me, ’Why is violence allowed?” It is not violence – it is catharsis. But society forces you to repress. It is as if you go to the hospital and you say to the doctors, “Why do you take pus out of people?” What can the doctors do? – the pus is there, it has to be taken out. It hurts when the pus is taken out but it has to be taken out, otherwise it will go on growing: it will become cancerous. So anger, violence has to be thrown out. Devices have to be found so all that the society has repressed in you can be taken out again and you are left clean, clear. And then you will suddenly see that the space that is clean starts changing its color, its shape – love arises, wells up. And when love arises it knows no qualifications; it is neither Christian nor Hindu. When love arises it knows no conditions. It is simply love. And that love redeems, liberates.\nJust be here – the taste of love will come to you.\n——– ******** ——–\n[Osho explains that prem sugata means well-gone in love... and that’s the door to the divine, for the face of love is God’s countenance. He walks on earth as love; that’s why you cannot hear his footsteps. He whispers as love; that’s why unless one is very very silent one will not be able to hear him. All that one needs is to be open... ]\n[The new sannyasin says that she’s studying in the Berlin and afraid of people; afraid to be lonely; afraid she will be more of an outsider as a sannyasin.]\nI am with you! And you will never be lonely. My sannyasins are there and Berlin has a big number of sannyasins. Soon we are going to turn on the whole of Germany – just wait. My eyes are on Germany! Don’t be worried at all.\n[She adds: It hurts very much.]\nIt is so for everybody, mm? because you feel that you will be left alone. But you will not be left alone – in fact more and more people will be asking you, “What is sannyas? What are you doing? What has happened to you?” People who have never approached you will be approaching you, and you will feel more at home than ever. Just go and see!\nNow you have something to share, and when a person has something to share, people start coming. You don’t see me around, I never leave my room, yet people go on coming from faraway lands. I don’t know exactly where Germany is because my geography is poor! I can never figure out where is what. I never leave the room but still people go on coming – and more and more will be coming. When you have something to give you are not alone.\nThe really lonely people are those who have nothing to give. Beggars are lonely, emperors are not lonely. When you have nothing to give nobody comes to you. Even if people come to you, soon they start escaping from you because you start exploiting them: you’re like a vacuum and you start sucking them, so nobody wants to come to a person who sucks. People naturally like to come to a person who showers his energy on them.\nJust go and be loving and you will see: many many people are coming; new people, strangers who you would never have expected to be so friendly with you will become friendly. This life is very strange: when you want people to be with you, nobody would like to be with you; when you are able to be alone, people start coming to you. If you need people, people will avoid you, because need means you will suck them. When you don’t need and you are perfectly happy being alone, enough unto yourself, you will suddenly wonder why people have started coming towards you. Because they will see that they can come and share something from you.\nSo just be there, loving, happy, meditating, and soon you will see that people are coming and you will not be alone, never. None of my sannyasins have ever felt anywhere in the world that they are alone. Everybody going for the first time wonders, “What is going to happen there?” because here there are so many sannyasins – you are in a family and everybody understands you and there you will be really an outsider. No. My sannyas is basically a science that makes you rooted in the world. You will never be an outsider, nowhere. Everywhere you will create a homely atmosphere. Love has that secret.\nSo just go with great love and great readiness to share with people. And right now Germany is agog with my name, so don’t be worried at all!\n——– ******** ——–\n[A couple are leaving. The man says: I feel like I am leaving a lover and I feel very sad but I’m still torn to be in the West.]\nNo, I would like you to be there, mm? Right now you have to be there for my work, so don’t think that you are going, think that I am sending you. And it makes a lot of difference. When you are going you may feel sad; when I am sending you there is no question of feeling sad.\nThis is your home, but a few people who can do much work there will be needed. And finally you have to come and be here, but then others will take on the work. Right now, continue to work.…\nFor the time being be there and whatsoever you can do, do it totally so that others can take over the work and then you can work here, mm?\n[The woman says: I feel that I’m pregnant since we’ve been here. Is there any meditation or thing to do that will be helpful for the baby or for us?]\nJust remain as happy and loving as possible. Avoid negativities – that’s what destroys the mind of the child. When the child is in formation he not only follows your body, he follows your mind too, because those are the blueprints. So if you are negative, that negativity starts entering in the build-up of the child from the very beginning. It becomes almost built-in, and then it is a long, arduous journey to drop it. If mothers were a little more careful, no primal scream would be needed. If mothers were a little more careful, psychoanalysis as a profession would disappear.\nPsychoanalysis is doing great business because of mothers, because according to psychoanalysis man’s only problem is the mother. If all the schools of psychoanalysis could be reduced to one single problem, it would be the mother. The mother is really of great significance because for nine months the child will live in the climate of the mother; he will imbibe her mind, her whole mind.\nSo don’t be negative. Be more and more in the yes mood – even sometimes when it looks hard. But that much sacrifice has to be made for the child. If you really want to have a child of some value, of some integrity, of some individuality, and a happy child, then that sacrifice has to be made. That is part of being a mother – that sacrifice. So don’t be negative at all; avoid all negativities. Avoid anger, avoid jealousy, avoid possessiveness, nagging, fighting, avoid these spaces. These you cannot afford – you are creating a new being! The work is of such importance that one cannot be silly and stupid.\nRejoice more and more, pray, dance, sing, listen to great music – not pop music. Listen to classical music, which is soothing and goes very deep into the unconscious, because the child can hear it only from there.\nSit silently as much as you can, enjoy nature. Be with trees, birds, animals, because they are really innocent. They are still part of the garden of Eden – only Adam and Eve have been thrown out. Even the tree of knowledge is still in the garden of Eden; only Adam has been thrown out. So be with nature more, and relax so that the child grows in a relaxed womb, non-tense; otherwise from the very beginning the child starts becoming neurotic.\n(to the man): And help her in these days so that she can be more positive. Don’t provoke her into negativity. Give her more and more time so that she can sit silently, be with the trees, listen to\nthe birds, the music. Avoid any situation in which you think it can become a provocation for her to become negative. Be more loving, rejoice in each other’s silence more, because you are both giving birth to something which is divine. Each child is divine, and when something great is going to happen, a great guest is going to come to your home, you don’t fight. And this may be the greatest guest that will ever come to you, so for these nine months be careful, cautious, watchful.\nBe more loving and less sexual. If sex happens out of being loving, it’s okay – but not for sex’s sake itself. From the very beginning that gives the child a deep-rooted sexuality. Sex is perfectly good in the context of love, as part of love – just as you hold hands and hug each other, as a part of love. One day you make love too but as part of love. It is not sexuality then; it is just a communion. You have not been thinking about sex; it has happened on its own. Playing with each other, being with each other, it has happened. You were not thinking of it, you were not brooding about it.\nIf for these nine months you can avoid sex as sex, that will be a great gift to the child. Then his life will not be so obsessed with sex as people’s lives are. Either they become too indulgent – which is obsession – or they become too repressive, too holy, too saintly; that too is obsession. In the world only these two types of people exist, and both are ill, both are pathological; the sinner and the saint are both pathological.\nA totally different kind, a third kind of human being, is needed. And that third kind of being will have this quality: no obsession with sex this way or that – neither against nor for; he will be exactly in the middle. Out of love sometimes he will move into sex, but then sex has a spiritual quality. It is not for sex itself. Because there will be no obsession with sex indulgence he will never become repressive. And because sex will have a spiritual quality it will give him glimpses of samadhi and he will start moving upwards, very slowly, very gradually, with no fuss about it. Otherwise spirituality makes so much fuss.\nA real spiritual person will not make much fuss; there is no need. He simply enjoys it, so he is not renouncing, he is not doing something great. He does not expect the whole world to give him attention and come and pay homage saying, “You are a great man because you have renounced this and you have renounced that.” He does not renounce anything at all. He enjoys everything and because of his total enjoyment his energy starts becoming more and more delightful, and finally more and more lightful.\nSo just these hints – you have to work them out. Good!\n——– ******** ——–\n[A sannyasin says: When I’m happy, I start dreaming and I can’t stop dreaming. then afterwards I get depressed, I feel I’ve wasted time.\nOsho checks her energy.]\nMake dreaming a meditation. Don’t be worried – it is not bad at all. Enjoy it. Make it a really beautiful trip, as psychedelic as possible, colorful.\nIt is not really dreaming, but you have a certain quality of being a visionary. That is a good quality, and if you help it you will attain much through it. Whenever dreaming starts and you are happy that\nsimply shows that you are a visionary. Otherwise after happiness there is no necessity for dreaming. When you are happy and flowing and together, something deep in you which is always there starts flowering. Visions look like dreams but there is a difference between the two: the dream is an unconscious activity and the vision is a super-conscious activity. Neither is conscious. The dream is below conscious, the vision is above conscious. So both look as if something is going wrong because you are going beyond your limitations of consciousness, but they are totally different.\nYour visionary, if given support, can create a great painter, can create a great poet; it has much potentiality. You can be very creative, and that’s what it needs. It is not to be stopped or prevented; rejoice in it. And soon you will see – if you cooperate, soon you will see that you would like to do something. For example, you may like to paint or you may like to write poetry or something. You may like to dance, sing, but some creativity will come out of it.\nDreaming is never creative. Modern psychology still has no idea of the vision and the quality of being a visionary, but there is really so much difference between the two that it has to be taken note of.\nA dream arises because of repression. You repress sexuality: you will have a sexual dream; you go on a fast and you will have a dream in which you are eating. Dreaming comes out of repression. And visions? They don’t come out of repression, they come out of your potential. Your super-conscious is trying to convey a message to you not to remain confined to your personality where you are right now; much more is possible. You can grow, you can become wider, you can expand.\nSo just allow it and cooperate with it and go with it the whole way. Don’t stop yourself. The farther you go, the better. And then you will not feel sad. It is your interpretation that is making you sad. After the trip you will feel really relaxed, replenished, rejuvenated.\n——– ******** ——–\n[A couple have been running a sannyas centre in the west, and ask if they should work there or be part of the new commune in Poona. The man says he likes to do his own thing.]\nThat’s very good – that’s what my feeling was. Mm, because the way you asked the question shows much about it! So you run the center, make it an ashram. That is my work. Here you will be doing my work, and there you will be doing my work, and if you can do it on your own better, that’s far better, mm? Make it a really big place now so that much can happen there.…\nWe need many ashrams around the world, mm? And you will be able to do perfectly well, so nothing to worry about. Good... good.\n——– ******** ——–\n[A sannyasin keeps thinking about an experience she had when she took sannyas – an experience of seeing a light. It was beautiful but it has never happened again.]\nRemember one thing: if something happens never ask for its repetition; otherwise it will never happen again. If you ask for it to be repeated, it cannot happen; if you forget all about it, it will happen many times. This is one of the fundamental laws.\nWhen you took sannyas and something happened, you were not expecting it; it came out of the blue. You were completely innocent. Now you are knowledgeable; that is the difficulty. That is the difference that is not allowing it to happen again. But this problem arises for every person. When for the first time something of the unknown penetrates you, you were not expecting, you were not asking, you had no idea of it. You were taken aback. You were in a kind of awe... innocent, available. Once it has happened you become knowledgeable; now you know – now you know the beauty of it and the benediction of it. You would like to repeat it, you are greedy for it; now the mind is asking. In that moment there was no mind, hence it happened. Now the mind is there and it won’t allow it to happen.\nSo forget all about it, and not only about this experience. On the spiritual path many experiences will happen, but once they happen, feel grateful to God and forget all about them. Never carry the idea in the mind... not even a lurking desire somewhere in a nook or comer; otherwise the greedy mind will not allow it to happen again. The mind is the barrier. It happened for the first time because there was no mind; now it cannot happen because the mind is asking for it. And it is beyond the mind so the mind cannot do anything about it. It can only feel frustrated.\nWhen you have forgotten it, one day suddenly it will be there again. God always comes suddenly. One has to remain in a state of ignorance... one has to remain in a state of no-knowledge. So just wait!\nThat was just a beginning and you became too attached to it. Much more is to happen – that is nothing, that is just a drop of the ocean. The whole ocean is waiting for you, but you have become so attached to that drop that you want to repeat it. You have been caught by the mind, and the ocean is there. Forget that drop. Many more drops will come, many more rivers will pour into you, many more oceans one day will enter you. But one has to continuously remember not to ask, not to desire. Yes, when it happens, feel grateful, thankful, and then simply forget all about it so you remain clean, you remain innocent.\nIt was something beautiful but much more is on the way.\n——– ******** ——–\n[A sannyasin is leaving to run a center. Help many people towards me, Osho says.]\nYou can do much. You are not yet aware of your own potentiality: you can be of great help to people. But there are a few things which we become aware of only when we start doing; there is no other way to become aware of them.\nMany people have many hidden qualities but because they never use them, they never become aware of them. Psychologists say that people use only five percent of their potential. Even the people who are very very talented – we call them geniuses – they use only fifteen percent of their potential. It is such a sheer wastage. If ninety-five percent of one’s potential is wasted then how can one be really happy? And if one day man can live at the optimum, at one hundred percent, this very earth will be paradise.\nOnly very few people have lived totally, and it is only because of those few people – a Buddha, a Jesus, a Mohammed, here and there – that life still has some joy, some beauty, some celebration...\nonly because of these few people. They are only drops in the ocean, but still if life has any color it is because of those few people. They can be counted on the fingers.

There is a sound of silence, and once it is heard then one has heard
all. That is the fundamental of existence. Existence is constituted of
that sound of silence. The Bible calls it “the word,” “logos,” and the
Zen people call it “the sound of one hand clapping.” Now, there is no
possibility of one hand clapping and creating a sound. It simply says,
indicates, the paradox: when one falls utterly silent inside then a
music is heard. That music is not constituted of any sound – it is
soundless – still it is music. It is the greatest mystery that one can
come to. In the East it is represented by the word “aum.” It does not
mean anything. It is simply a symbol for that soundless sound.</p><p><br></p><p>One has to become more and more quiet, thoughtless, because the music
is there but we are so enveloped by the noise of our own minds that we
cannot hear it. This constant inner talk has to stop and then suddenly
that soundless sound explodes in you. And that is a great ecstatic
experience – incomparable, unique; there is nothing like it. And once it
has happened, you become it. Then you can live in the marketplace but
you are not there. You can act in a thousand and one ways but you remain
inactive. You can get involved in every kind of situation yet you are a
witness. And that’s the beauty. The most important thing in life is to
attain it; then the whole of life is just a drama.</p><p><br></p><p>One plays but one is not worried. One lives moment to moment and one
has no will of one’s own. Then God’s will is fulfilled. That’s what
Jesus means when he says: “Thy will be done, thy kingdom come.” But for
his kingdom to come we have to disappear utterly as a noisy place. And
that’s what meditation is all about. The whole effort here is to bring
your mind to such a stop that you can hear your own innermost core – the
still, small voice of the heart.</p><p><br></p><p>[The new sannyasin asks: Why is it so difficult to love?]</p><p><br></p><p>Because we have been brought up not to love. Our whole conditioning
is against love, and the conditioning is great – twenty years of
conditioning, twenty-five years of conditioning. You will have</p><p>to drop that conditioning, then love will arise. Love is our nature,
so even though the conditioning is deep we still hanker for it. It is
like a hungry man who has been hypnotized and told in hypnosis for
twenty years continuously, “You are not hungry.” That will be the
situation for him: he will feel hunger and still his mind will deny it.
His mind will say, “You are not hungry... because of those twenty years
of conditioning, of constant suggestion, mind-wash.</p><p><br></p><p>And the society up to now has existed on the foundation of hate,
violence, aggression; it is afraid of love. And once love explodes in
the world this so-called society is going to disappear, so there is
going to be a great clash.</p><p><br></p><p>For example a loving person cannot be persuaded to go to war; it is
impossible. The different states cannot exist if the person is loving,
because where will they find their armies? From where will Adolf Hitler
find his Nazis and Mussolini his fascists? From where? It will be
impossible. Everybody has to be so starved of love that love goes sour
and becomes hate. Then one is just boiling within; everybody is just a
volcano, ready to explode at any excuse. That’s why every ten years we
need a great war. That is a catharsis: it helps people to relieve
themselves of all the anger, all the hatred, that they have
accumulated.</p><p><br></p><p>Love is the right direction for your life. If the right direction is
not given, then love itself turns into hate. Hate is nothing but love
standing on its head, upside down.</p><p><br></p><p>Now just think: if the whole world is loving, the states cannot
exist, India cannot exist, Germany cannot exist, England cannot exist,
America cannot exist, China, Soviet Russia... none of these can exist,
because then people will be so loving that they will see the whole
stupidity of war. “Why should we fight? Why should we kill each other?
We can make this earth a paradise.”</p><p><br></p><p>And the energy that we put into war is tremendous. Almost ninety
percent of human energy is being wasted in war. War has been our
constant history – chronic. In three thousand years man has fought five
thousand wars. The earth seems to be mad! – as if we are here only to
fight and kill each other and murder each other.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, this kind of world cannot allow love to grow. It depends on
hate. The politician cannot allow love to happen. The priest cannot
allow love to happen. If the priest allows love to happen then how will
you manage your crusades and holy wars? If love is allowed, love will
not know the distinction between a Christian and a Hindu and a
Mohammedan. Love will not know the distinction between a Jew and a
Jaina. Love knows no distinctions. Churches will start disappearing.
Churches can exist only if hate exists.</p><p><br></p><p>Now this is very strange: all the churches talk about love and all
the churches create hate in the world. The history of religion is more
bloody than the history of anything else. And there is a biological
reason also for how it all started, because the question arises: if man
is by nature loving, then why did he manage such a kind of society in
the very beginning? It was a question of survival. We have forgotten all
those days, but five thousand years back man was constantly afraid of
being killed by the animals. He was in constant fear. He had to fight
back; to survive he had to constantly kill.</p><p><br></p><p>Now all those days are gone – there is no need to kill. In fact,
there are not any animals left to kill. Now we are trying to protect
them, whatsoever is left. But the old habit persisted. First we</p><p>were fighting with animals, for centuries, for millennia; then it
became an instinct – fighting. Then we started fighting with people,
tribes, nations, ideologies, religions. The fight Continues – we only
change the labels.</p><p><br></p><p>But my understanding is that now the future is not going to follow
this past. A great revolution is on the way. And this will be the
revolution – that man will start loving and will drop all the nonsense
that comes as a hindrance to love; and there are a thousand and one
kinds of hindrances.</p><p><br></p><p>This is my problem. Because I teach love the government is against
me, the politicians are against me, the priests are against me. And I am
not teaching people to murder each other. I am simply teaching people to
be more loving. Why are they so against it?</p><p><br></p><p>Their very foundation is based on hatred. They hide it. They write in
big letters: “Love is God” – but behind it are only bayonets, atomic
bombs, hydrogen bombs, super bombs – piles upon piles. Man has
accumulated so many bombs that we can kill each person seven times. Now
this is futile. One person is killed in one go; there is no need to kill
him seven times. But just in case one might survive... we will not allow
him to. And this goes on! Each country goes on giving the major
proportion of its wealth to war – even a country like India which talks
about nonviolence, which talks about great ideals, Mahatma Gandhi, et
cetera. But seventy percent of the wealth of the country goes into war
efforts – and a poor country, starving! But that is not the point: war
has to be looked to first. You can die starving, that’s okay, but we
have to make bombs!</p><p><br></p><p>This is an utterly neurotic world in which we are living. So unless
you become very alert and drop all the conditionings that your society
has given to you, you will not be able to love. And all these groups
that are being run here are basically meant for that. So in some groups
I even allow fighting. Anger has to be expressed. It has to be vomited
out, because if you don’t vomit it out, it will remain in your system,
it will poison you. Now that becomes a problem.</p><p><br></p><p>People go on asking me, ’Why is violence allowed?” It is not violence
– it is catharsis. But society forces you to repress. It is as if you go
to the hospital and you say to the doctors, “Why do you take pus out of
people?” What can the doctors do? – the pus is there, it has to be taken
out. It hurts when the pus is taken out but it has to be taken out,
otherwise it will go on growing: it will become cancerous. So anger,
violence has to be thrown out. Devices have to be found so all that the
society has repressed in you can be taken out again and you are left
clean, clear. And then you will suddenly see that the space that is
clean starts changing its color, its shape – love arises, wells up. And
when love arises it knows no qualifications; it is neither Christian nor
Hindu. When love arises it knows no conditions. It is simply love. And
that love redeems, liberates.</p><p><br></p><p>Just be here – the taste of love will come to you.</p><p><br></p><p>——– ******** ——–</p><p><br></p><p>[Osho explains that prem sugata means well-gone in love... and that’s
the door to the divine, for the face of love is God’s countenance. He
walks on earth as love; that’s why you cannot hear his footsteps. He
whispers as love; that’s why unless one is very very silent one will not
be able to hear him. All that one needs is to be open... ]</p><p>[The new sannyasin says that she’s studying in the Berlin and afraid
of people; afraid to be lonely; afraid she will be more of an outsider
as a sannyasin.]</p><p><br></p><p>I am with you! And you will never be lonely. My sannyasins are there
and Berlin has a big number of sannyasins. Soon we are going to turn on
the whole of Germany – just wait. My eyes are on Germany! Don’t be
worried at all.</p><p><br></p><p>[She adds: It hurts very much.]</p><p><br></p><p>It is so for everybody, mm? because you feel that you will be left
alone. But you will not be left alone – in fact more and more people
will be asking you, “What is sannyas? What are you doing? What has
happened to you?” People who have never approached you will be
approaching you, and you will feel more at home than ever. Just go and
see!</p><p><br></p><p>Now you have something to share, and when a person has something to
share, people start coming. You don’t see me around, I never leave my
room, yet people go on coming from faraway lands. I don’t know exactly
where Germany is because my geography is poor! I can never figure out
where is what. I never leave the room but still people go on coming –
and more and more will be coming. When you have something to give you
are not alone.</p><p><br></p><p>The really lonely people are those who have nothing to give. Beggars
are lonely, emperors are not lonely. When you have nothing to give
nobody comes to you. Even if people come to you, soon they start
escaping from you because you start exploiting them: you’re like a
vacuum and you start sucking them, so nobody wants to come to a person
who sucks. People naturally like to come to a person who showers his
energy on them.</p><p><br></p><p>Just go and be loving and you will see: many many people are coming;
new people, strangers who you would never have expected to be so
friendly with you will become friendly. This life is very strange: when
you want people to be with you, nobody would like to be with you; when
you are able to be alone, people start coming to you. If you need
people, people will avoid you, because need means you will suck them.
When you don’t need and you are perfectly happy being alone, enough unto
yourself, you will suddenly wonder why people have started coming
towards you. Because they will see that they can come and share
something from you.</p><p><br></p><p>So just be there, loving, happy, meditating, and soon you will see
that people are coming and you will not be alone, never. None of my
sannyasins have ever felt anywhere in the world that they are alone.
Everybody going for the first time wonders, “What is going to happen
there?” because here there are so many sannyasins – you are in a family
and everybody understands you and there you will be really an outsider.
No. My sannyas is basically a science that makes you rooted in the
world. You will never be an outsider, nowhere. Everywhere you will
create a homely atmosphere. Love has that secret.</p><p><br></p><p>So just go with great love and great readiness to share with people.
And right now Germany is agog with my name, so don’t be worried at
all!</p><p><br></p><p>——– ******** ——–</p><p>[A couple are leaving. The man says: I feel like I am leaving a lover
and I feel very sad but I’m still torn to be in the West.]</p><p><br></p><p>No, I would like you to be there, mm? Right now you have to be there
for my work, so don’t think that you are going, think that I am sending
you. And it makes a lot of difference. When you are going you may feel
sad; when I am sending you there is no question of feeling sad.</p><p><br></p><p>This is your home, but a few people who can do much work there will
be needed. And finally you have to come and be here, but then others
will take on the work. Right now, continue to work.…</p><p><br></p><p>For the time being be there and whatsoever you can do, do it totally
so that others can take over the work and then you can work here,
mm?</p><p><br></p><p>[The woman says: I feel that I’m pregnant since we’ve been here. Is
there any meditation or thing to do that will be helpful for the baby or
for us?]</p><p><br></p><p>Just remain as happy and loving as possible. Avoid negativities –
that’s what destroys the mind of the child. When the child is in
formation he not only follows your body, he follows your mind too,
because those are the blueprints. So if you are negative, that
negativity starts entering in the build-up of the child from the very
beginning. It becomes almost built-in, and then it is a long, arduous
journey to drop it. If mothers were a little more careful, no primal
scream would be needed. If mothers were a little more careful,
psychoanalysis as a profession would disappear.</p><p><br></p><p>Psychoanalysis is doing great business because of mothers, because
according to psychoanalysis man’s only problem is the mother. If all the
schools of psychoanalysis could be reduced to one single problem, it
would be the mother. The mother is really of great significance because
for nine months the child will live in the climate of the mother; he
will imbibe her mind, her whole mind.</p><p><br></p><p>So don’t be negative. Be more and more in the yes mood – even
sometimes when it looks hard. But that much sacrifice has to be made for
the child. If you really want to have a child of some value, of some
integrity, of some individuality, and a happy child, then that sacrifice
has to be made. That is part of being a mother – that sacrifice. So
don’t be negative at all; avoid all negativities. Avoid anger, avoid
jealousy, avoid possessiveness, nagging, fighting, avoid these spaces.
These you cannot afford – you are creating a new being! The work is of
such importance that one cannot be silly and stupid.</p><p><br></p><p>Rejoice more and more, pray, dance, sing, listen to great music – not
pop music. Listen to classical music, which is soothing and goes very
deep into the unconscious, because the child can hear it only from
there.</p><p><br></p><p>Sit silently as much as you can, enjoy nature. Be with trees, birds,
animals, because they are really innocent. They are still part of the
garden of Eden – only Adam and Eve have been thrown out. Even the tree
of knowledge is still in the garden of Eden; only Adam has been thrown
out. So be with nature more, and relax so that the child grows in a
relaxed womb, non-tense; otherwise from the very beginning the child
starts becoming neurotic.</p><p><br></p><p>(to the man): And help her in these days so that she can be more
positive. Don’t provoke her into negativity. Give her more and more time
so that she can sit silently, be with the trees, listen to</p><p>the birds, the music. Avoid any situation in which you think it can
become a provocation for her to become negative. Be more loving, rejoice
in each other’s silence more, because you are both giving birth to
something which is divine. Each child is divine, and when something
great is going to happen, a great guest is going to come to your home,
you don’t fight. And this may be the greatest guest that will ever come
to you, so for these nine months be careful, cautious, watchful.</p><p><br></p><p>Be more loving and less sexual. If sex happens out of being loving,
it’s okay – but not for sex’s sake itself. From the very beginning that
gives the child a deep-rooted sexuality. Sex is perfectly good in the
context of love, as part of love – just as you hold hands and hug each
other, as a part of love. One day you make love too but as part of love.
It is not sexuality then; it is just a communion. You have not been
thinking about sex; it has happened on its own. Playing with each other,
being with each other, it has happened. You were not thinking of it, you
were not brooding about it.</p><p><br></p><p>If for these nine months you can avoid sex as sex, that will be a
great gift to the child. Then his life will not be so obsessed with sex
as people’s lives are. Either they become too indulgent – which is
obsession – or they become too repressive, too holy, too saintly; that
too is obsession. In the world only these two types of people exist, and
both are ill, both are pathological; the sinner and the saint are both
pathological.</p><p><br></p><p>A totally different kind, a third kind of human being, is needed. And
that third kind of being will have this quality: no obsession with sex
this way or that – neither against nor for; he will be exactly in the
middle. Out of love sometimes he will move into sex, but then sex has a
spiritual quality. It is not for sex itself. Because there will be no
obsession with sex indulgence he will never become repressive. And
because sex will have a spiritual quality it will give him glimpses of
samadhi and he will start moving upwards, very slowly, very gradually,
with no fuss about it. Otherwise spirituality makes so much fuss.</p><p><br></p><p>A real spiritual person will not make much fuss; there is no need. He
simply enjoys it, so he is not renouncing, he is not doing something
great. He does not expect the whole world to give him attention and come
and pay homage saying, “You are a great man because you have renounced
this and you have renounced that.” He does not renounce anything at all.
He enjoys everything and because of his total enjoyment his energy
starts becoming more and more delightful, and finally more and more
lightful.</p><p><br></p><p>So just these hints – you have to work them out. Good!</p><p><br></p><p>——– ******** ——–</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin says: When I’m happy, I start dreaming and I can’t stop
dreaming. then afterwards I get depressed, I feel I’ve wasted time.</p><p><br></p><p>Osho checks her energy.]</p><p><br></p><p>Make dreaming a meditation. Don’t be worried – it is not bad at all.
Enjoy it. Make it a really beautiful trip, as psychedelic as possible,
colorful.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not really dreaming, but you have a certain quality of being a
visionary. That is a good quality, and if you help it you will attain
much through it. Whenever dreaming starts and you are happy that</p><p>simply shows that you are a visionary. Otherwise after happiness
there is no necessity for dreaming. When you are happy and flowing and
together, something deep in you which is always there starts flowering.
Visions look like dreams but there is a difference between the two: the
dream is an unconscious activity and the vision is a super-conscious
activity. Neither is conscious. The dream is below conscious, the vision
is above conscious. So both look as if something is going wrong because
you are going beyond your limitations of consciousness, but they are
totally different.</p><p><br></p><p>Your visionary, if given support, can create a great painter, can
create a great poet; it has much potentiality. You can be very creative,
and that’s what it needs. It is not to be stopped or prevented; rejoice
in it. And soon you will see – if you cooperate, soon you will see that
you would like to do something. For example, you may like to paint or
you may like to write poetry or something. You may like to dance, sing,
but some creativity will come out of it.</p><p><br></p><p>Dreaming is never creative. Modern psychology still has no idea of
the vision and the quality of being a visionary, but there is really so
much difference between the two that it has to be taken note of.</p><p><br></p><p>A dream arises because of repression. You repress sexuality: you will
have a sexual dream; you go on a fast and you will have a dream in which
you are eating. Dreaming comes out of repression. And visions? They
don’t come out of repression, they come out of your potential. Your
super-conscious is trying to convey a message to you not to remain
confined to your personality where you are right now; much more is
possible. You can grow, you can become wider, you can expand.</p><p><br></p><p>So just allow it and cooperate with it and go with it the whole way.
Don’t stop yourself. The farther you go, the better. And then you will
not feel sad. It is your interpretation that is making you sad. After
the trip you will feel really relaxed, replenished, rejuvenated.</p><p><br></p><p>——– ******** ——–</p><p><br></p><p>[A couple have been running a sannyas centre in the west, and ask if
they should work there or be part of the new commune in Poona. The man
says he likes to do his own thing.]</p><p><br></p><p>That’s very good – that’s what my feeling was. Mm, because the way
you asked the question shows much about it! So you run the center, make
it an ashram. That is my work. Here you will be doing my work, and there
you will be doing my work, and if you can do it on your own better,
that’s far better, mm? Make it a really big place now so that much can
happen there.…</p><p><br></p><p>We need many ashrams around the world, mm? And you will be able to do
perfectly well, so nothing to worry about. Good... good.</p><p><br></p><p>——– ******** ——–</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin keeps thinking about an experience she had when she took
sannyas – an experience of seeing a light. It was beautiful but it has
never happened again.]</p><p><br></p><p>Remember one thing: if something happens never ask for its
repetition; otherwise it will never happen again. If you ask for it to
be repeated, it cannot happen; if you forget all about it, it will
happen many times. This is one of the fundamental laws.</p><p>When you took sannyas and something happened, you were not expecting
it; it came out of the blue. You were completely innocent. Now you are
knowledgeable; that is the difficulty. That is the difference that is
not allowing it to happen again. But this problem arises for every
person. When for the first time something of the unknown penetrates you,
you were not expecting, you were not asking, you had no idea of it. You
were taken aback. You were in a kind of awe... innocent, available. Once
it has happened you become knowledgeable; now you know – now you know
the beauty of it and the benediction of it. You would like to repeat it,
you are greedy for it; now the mind is asking. In that moment there was
no mind, hence it happened. Now the mind is there and it won’t allow it
to happen.</p><p><br></p><p>So forget all about it, and not only about this experience. On the
spiritual path many experiences will happen, but once they happen, feel
grateful to God and forget all about them. Never carry the idea in the
mind... not even a lurking desire somewhere in a nook or comer;
otherwise the greedy mind will not allow it to happen again. The mind is
the barrier. It happened for the first time because there was no mind;
now it cannot happen because the mind is asking for it. And it is beyond
the mind so the mind cannot do anything about it. It can only feel
frustrated.</p><p><br></p><p>When you have forgotten it, one day suddenly it will be there again.
God always comes suddenly. One has to remain in a state of ignorance...
one has to remain in a state of no-knowledge. So just wait!</p><p><br></p><p>That was just a beginning and you became too attached to it. Much
more is to happen – that is nothing, that is just a drop of the ocean.
The whole ocean is waiting for you, but you have become so attached to
that drop that you want to repeat it. You have been caught by the mind,
and the ocean is there. Forget that drop. Many more drops will come,
many more rivers will pour into you, many more oceans one day will enter
you. But one has to continuously remember not to ask, not to desire.
Yes, when it happens, feel grateful, thankful, and then simply forget
all about it so you remain clean, you remain innocent.</p><p><br></p><p>It was something beautiful but much more is on the way.</p><p><br></p><p>——– ******** ——–</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin is leaving to run a center. Help many people towards me,
Osho says.]</p><p><br></p><p>You can do much. You are not yet aware of your own potentiality: you
can be of great help to people. But there are a few things which we
become aware of only when we start doing; there is no other way to
become aware of them.</p><p><br></p><p>Many people have many hidden qualities but because they never use
them, they never become aware of them. Psychologists say that people use
only five percent of their potential. Even the people who are very very
talented – we call them geniuses – they use only fifteen percent of
their potential. It is such a sheer wastage. If ninety-five percent of
one’s potential is wasted then how can one be really happy? And if one
day man can live at the optimum, at one hundred percent, this very earth
will be paradise.</p><p><br></p><p>Only very few people have lived totally, and it is only because of
those few people – a Buddha, a Jesus, a Mohammed, here and there – that
life still has some joy, some beauty, some celebration...</p><p>only because of these few people. They are only drops in the ocean,
but still if life has any color it is because of those few people. They
can be counted on the fingers. Just imagine if everybody is living at
the optimum, what kind of life this will be! Angels will long to be born
on earth...</p><p><br></p><p>Help people, and that’s how you will find your Own potential, your
possibilities. Compassion helps one to bloom as nothing else does.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part6>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

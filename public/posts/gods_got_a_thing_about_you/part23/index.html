Simplicity is living a life without any idea about how to live it, without any ideology. Ideology brings complexity into life. Animals are simple, no animal is ever complex because no animal is burdened by any ideology. There is no “should”; the animal simply lives the way it feels. It has no goal to achieve, nowhere to go, but just to live the gift of life that has been given to it.\nSimplicity is animal-like – the same purity, the same innocence. One should not live through “shoulds,” one should drop all “oughts.” The isness of life is enough; nothing else is needed. Life has no goal. It is enough unto itself. Life is not a means to some end. It is the means and it is the end; it is both. And when you are simple, you are naturally natural.\nTo live in nature is to live in God. To live through a certain culture is to go away from God. The more cultured, civilized, cultivated, a person is, the farther away he is from God. To know God one has to be in a state of primalness... just as trees live. Be simple like the animals, be natural like the trees. And if you are simple and natural you are bound to be spontaneous. Then you cannot live out of the past. You have no obsession to be consistent with your past; you are free to live the moment. You are not somehow to make your present consistent with the past.\nThe person who tries to make his present consistent with the past is thought to be the man of character – virtuous, religious. He is not – he is a dead man. If your present has to follow the past, how can you be alive? The present has to have its say, sing its song, dance its dance, unburdened, untethered to the past. There is no necessity to be consistent with the past. The spontaneous man is always inconsistent – bound to be, because each moment has to be decisive on its own. No moment has to be decided by another moment, neither of the past nor of the future.\nThere are two kinds of dead people: one, who is dominated by the past; another, who is dominated\nby the future. But both kill their present, hence both are dead. The spontaneous man knows only one time, and that is this moment; there is no other time for him.\nThese three things are the foundations of sahaja. It is one of the most significant approaches towards life. Sahaja means Tao. So live like animals, live like trees, live like small children, moment to moment. The child is laughing one moment and crying another moment and has no confusion about it, that he is being inconsistent. One moment he says, “I will never see you again” – he is so angry. Another moment he is sitting in your lap and has completely forgotten what he had said just a moment before.\nThis moment-to-momentness makes one free, alive, total.\n——– ******** ——–\nDeva means divine, aggeya means the unknowable. God is not known, has never been known, will never be known. God cannot be reduced to knowledge – God remains love. God is something that happens through the heart and not through the mind; hence the impossibility of knowing. Knowledge is the function of the mind; you cannot love through the mind. And in the same way you cannot know through the heart. The heart loves – the mind knows. God is available only through the heart. You can love God, you can be God, because love leads one to being, but not to knowledge. If you really love you become it.\nThe real lovers lose their separate identities; they become one. Even if their bodies are separate, even though they function as separate individuals, somewhere on a deeper level they are no more separate, they are bridged, as if there is one soul in two bodies, or it will be even better to say: two bodies in one soul. But love never becomes knowledge. That’s why man has loved woman down the ages and has not yet known what a woman is. Woman has loved man for centuries, but has not known exactly what a man is. There is no way of knowing.\nGod is the ultimate love affair. These small love affairs that happen between man and woman, between man and man, woman and woman, are just preparations for the ultimate love affair, just steps to the door of the divine. But each love leads you towards prayer. Prayer is love with God.\nSo God cannot be known... it is an absolute truth that God cannot be known. It is not that God is unknown, because anything that is unknown can become known someday. The moon was unknown; now the moon is known. Science has changed many unknowns into knowns. So God is not only unknown – God is unknowable, cannot be reduced to knowledge ever. Its unknowableness is its intrinsic nature. It is impossible... it is as impossible as seeing through the ears and hearing through the eyes.\nKnowledge relates to the mind. Knowledge means that you are separate from the object known. Knowledge implies separation. Knowledge means that the knower is there, the known is there, and between the two there is a certain kind of relationship happening. Knowledge is a relationship between the two. Love is the experience of becoming one; it is not between the two. Love is not a communication, but a communion. Knowledge is a communication, knowledge is a dialogue. Love is silence. There is no “I,” no “thou.”\nThis is the mystery of existence. It is good and it is immensely beautiful that it cannot be reduced to knowledge, because once something becomes known it becomes mundane. Once something becomes known we cannot have any wonder about it any more. Wonder is killed by knowledge.\nGod means the ultimate mystery of existence; it cannot be killed. One can go on wondering and wondering and wondering and there is no end to it; it keeps man wondering. And wonder has immense beauty because in the moment of wonder you become a child again, in the moment of wonder you are innocent again. When you know, you are no more innocent. Knowledge corrupts you, makes you cunning and clever. You become knowledgeable, it gives you ego. Wonder, and the ego disappears, and with the ego all its trips are gone. You know nothing. In the state of wonder you are in the state of not-knowing, and that not-knowing is immense. Knowledge is always limited, non- knowledge is unlimited. Knowledge can be increased, decreased – innocence cannot be increased, cannot be decreased.\nBy giving you this name I am simply giving you an indication to become more and more ignorant, to become utterly ignorant. When one is ignorant one is full of heart. Then the heart really beats, then one really breathes. And then one is in tune with the source again... one has fallen into nature and its harmony again.\n——– ******** ——–\nDeva means divine, sugita means a song – a divine song. Life should not be taken seriously. The moment one starts taking life seriously one becomes calculative, and to be calculative is to miss all. Life belongs to those people who are non-calculative. Life does not belong to arithmetic – it belongs to art. Life is known only through being sensitive, aesthetic, vulnerable. Life cannot be approached through logic. The door to life is not logic but love. Anything that makes one serious is part of death. Anything that makes one sing, dance, laugh, love, is part of life.\nMillions of people are really dead. They breathe and they go on doing their things day in, day out, but they are not alive – living, but not alive. Their flame is burning very low. They don’t know any inspiration. They don’t know any song bursting through their souls. They have never seen any arousal in their being, they have never moved to any higher plenitudes of consciousness. They only crawl and creep; they never soar high. Yes, they are living but it is a pseudo kind of life.\nLife happens only when you become a song, you become a dance, when you start blooming. Life is life only when there is a great inspiration in you; and remember, inspiration is not excitement. Because people are bored they seek and search for excitement; because people are dead they seek and search for excitement. Anything that excites them makes them feel a little unburdened, but again they are back in their bored state.\nInspiration is a totally different phenomenon. Excitement comes from the outside; inspiration comes from the inside. That is the very meaning of the word “inspiration”: it comes from your inner core, it grows like a tree in you. Excitement is momentary, inspiration is a continuity.\nPeople are bored, hence they search for excitement – any kind of excitement; through sex, through drugs or through traveling, through violence. If they cannot commit violence then at least they can see it on the TV or in the films, or they can read a detective novel. That is a vicarious way of living\nviolence. That’s why whenever there is a war people become very excited. This shows that life is being lived at the very lowest stage. People need constant props from the outside to remain a little excited, otherwise life is dull, meaningless.\nInspiration is an inner flow, an inner song... as if one is constantly humming inside, singing inside, dancing inside. A man who knows the way of inspiration never seeks excitement. There is no need – he is not bored at all, he is living at the maximum. His life is ecstatic; hence there is no need for any excitement.\nThis is the meaning of your name. I would like you to become a divine song, an inner humming, an inner chanting, an inner dance that continues.\nWhatsoever you are doing on the outside, it still continues like an undercurrent; like a small stream it goes on flowing. Slowly slowly you can feel it even while you are engaged in work, occupied, doing things – cooking, cleaning, taking care or whatsoever – but you can feel it constantly. And whenever you have time you can close your eyes and you can listen to it, you can be it.\nAnd this is possible, because I see a song that is just waiting, which needs just a little help, a little persuasion. And that’s my work here: to persuade people to laugh, to love, to live.\n——– ******** ——–\nDeva means divine, prashanti means silence, deep silence – a deep divine silence. Man can cultivate silence but then it is neither deep nor divine. Man can practice a kind of silence. It remains human, practiced, it remains just like an outer layer of your being. Deep down you go on boiling.\nYou can see many people who look silent but deep down they are getting madder and madder every day. They go on repressing: first they repress from others, then slowly slowly they start repressing from themselves. That’s how the unconscious is created. If a person never represses anything he will not have any unconscious mind. The unconscious mind is just a part of the mind that you don’t want to look at, that you are afraid to look at, that you are afraid to accept. All that you have denied goes on accumulating there. It is a kind of basement where you go on throwing all the rubbishy things that you don’t know how to get rid of. You don’t want to keep them there – they are ugly and you don’t want anybody to see them in your house – and you don’t know how to get rid of them, so the only possible way seems to be to hide them somewhere in a dark corner where nobody will see. Slowly slowly you start avoiding that dark corner; you don’t go to that side. You start forgetting about it – you want to forget about it; that’s how the unconscious mind is created. The unconscious mind is a man-created phenomenon.\nIf a man never represses anything – rather than throwing things in the basement he tries to understand them – there will be only consciousness in him and his whole house will be full of light, because through understanding, whatsoever is useless dissolves. Understanding is a fire. Understanding is one of the greatest energies in the world. Just by understanding something totally, it is burnt; it simply evaporates. You need not repress it. You cannot even find it, so how can you repress it?\nAnd if something is valuable, if something is part of your inner nature, then understanding cleanses it, bums that which is not natural to you and cleanses and purifies that which is natural to you.\nUnderstanding is a double-edged sword: it cuts the unessential, the pseudo, and it sharpens the essential and the natural. Understanding is a great miracle, the secret of all magic, of all transformation, of all alchemy.\nSo if somebody represses his tensions he can create a kind of silence which will only be on the surface. But he will know that the enemy is still there and fully alive and will assert itself someday, whenever the time arrives, and will not only assert itself but will assert itself with a vengeance.\nThat’s why you see these things happening: a silent man suddenly murders somebody. One never even thought that he would be a murderer. You had lived with him so long, you had known him – he was so beautiful and so sweet and so gentlemanly – and one day suddenly in the morning newspaper you see he has murdered someone or committed suicide. Seems almost unbelievable, but it is unbelievable because we don’t know his inner story. The inner story is that on the surface he was maintaining a face, a mask, and deep down he was just the opposite. He carried it as far as was humanly possible; then the limit came. Either one goes mad or commits a murder, commits suicide or something like that. That’s not true silence.\nTrue silence is when you don’t cultivate it but on the contrary you start looking into your anguish, anxiety, tensions, thoughts, all of your mad mind... when you look into it deeply, perceptively, sympathetically, lovingly, because you want to understand. It is your mind and you want to understand it, because without understanding it you will never be wise, without understanding it you will never become known to yourself; there is no possibility of self-knowledge. And without self-knowledge all other kinds of knowledge are just futile.\nSo try to understand your mind. Don’t condemn it, don’t repress it. Give it full play... allow it. Bring all that is thrown into the basement back into the consciousness. Allow everything to come to the surface so you can see, watch, observe, analyze, look into, with no prejudice, with no antagonism. Because if you have even a slight antagonism it will not come up, it will hide.\nTo be friendly with one’s mind is one of the greatest steps in self-transformation. And all the religions of the world have been teaching just the opposite. Not Jesus, not Buddha, but the priests and the pundits and the people who have created Christianity and Buddhism and Hinduism – the people who are really politicians in the name of religion – these people have been teaching you to condemn your mind, to repress your mind. They have driven the whole of humanity insane, they have made the whole earth a madhouse.\nMy work here is totally different, diametrically opposite; hence they are all angry with me. If I succeed then there will be no possibility of any priesthood in the future, no possibility of exploiting humanity and driving people mad.\nAnd this is the fundamental law of dissolving all kinds of madnesses: try to understand everything that arises in you with great love, with great caring. And you will be surprised – if you understand it, two things are possible: if it is useless to your growth it will be burnt and nothing will be found, not even a trace; if it is helpful to your growth, beneficial to you, it will be strengthened, nourished, it will start growing.\nThen comes prashanti – then comes real, deep silence and that silence is very alive. It is not the silence of a cemetery, it is the silence of music, it is the silence of a garden. It is the silence which\nthrobs with life. It is a silence that can sing, that can dance. It is a silence that can be creative; in fact it becomes creativity. It is silence that wants to share itself with others, a silence that wants to give itself to others. It is a silence that becomes love.\n——– ******** ——–\nDeva means divine, nutano means new. Life is always new, it is never old; only the mind becomes old. The mind is always old, it is never new. Hence life and mind never meet. One is always old, the other is always new. How can they meet? Where can they meet? The mind cannot be new, life cannot be old; there is no possibility of any bridge between the two. So those who live in the mind cannot be alive, and those who want be alive have to be courageous enough to come out of the mind and live.\nThe mind gives a kind of security, safety, because it moves only in the familiar. It is a very cowardly mechanism, very orthodox. Because it moves in the familiar it feels good – you know everything, you know the whole territory, you are efficient. Life always demands learning: you have to learn moment to moment. You are always in the process of learning with life. Life never gives you a chance to become knowledgeable. It goes on changing so fast that by the time you know something it is already out of date, it is no more relevant. Life has moved ahead. Life creates new questions and the mind goes on repeating old answers.\nTo be a sannyasin means: start inquiring into this phenomenon. Scrutinize your mind and see yourself that it is always old. It is not in its nature to be new. The mind means memory. How can the memory be the new? The mind means the experienced, the mind means that which was yesterday. Yesterday has left a few traces in your memory; that is your mind. And if one lives in the mind, yesterday demands your today also to be like it and your tomorrow also to follow in the same track. Then you go on missing life and slowly slowly you start living in the mind. That’s what madness is: to live in the mind irrespective of life, to live completely in fantasy which is absolutely irrelevant to the reality outside. That’s what madness isl\nTo be sane means to live with the reality as it is. To be sane means not to live through the mind. Use the mind – it has certain utilities, but those utilities are only technological. Use the mind for technological ends but don’t use it for living purposes. It is a good mechanism, like a computer, so when you need some information about the past, consult it, but don’t let it hinder your life. Keep it aside. Live fresh, not through the memory, not through conclusions, not through knowledge. Live utterly nude, innocent, like a child... with open eyes, with no knowledge, with wonder and awe, and you will be surprised because you will confront God immediately.\nTo live without the mind is to know God. To live in the mind is to live without knowing that which surrounds you. The man who lives through the mind is the irreligious man. The religious man is one who lives without the mind, never allows the mind to interfere in his life, keeps his mind aside for other purposes. The mind is a good library, a good Encyclopedia Britannica. Yes, sometimes it is needed – one can consult it. Consult it, thank it, but don’t let it become your master; let it remain your servant. It is a good servant and a very dangerous master.\n——– ******** ——–\n[A sannyasin couple have just arrived. The woman says: I feel like I’m too active all the time. I always go to things and never let them come into me. It’s like I don’t live moment to moment. It’s the trouble between my partner and me.]\nNothing to be worried about – I need a few active people too! Just get involved in the ashram activities; nothing is wrong. You have the energy, that’s why, and if you try to become passive, that will be repressing it. You have to use it in the right, creative way. And it is good – to have more energy is a blessing! It can become a curse if you don’t know where to put it, how to use it; then it can drive you neurotic. If energy is used rightly it becomes creation; if it is not used rightly then it becomes restlessness.\nSo don’t be worried, I need so much energy – so much work has to be done in the world. So don’t make a problem of it – just put it into the work.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"3643","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/gods_got_a_thing_about_you/part23/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/gods_got_a_thing_about_you/>God\'s Got a Thing About you</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">23</h1><div class=post-meta>18 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;3643 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Gods_Got_a_Thing_About_you/part23.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part22>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

Simplicity is living a life without any idea about how to live it,
without any ideology. Ideology brings complexity into life. Animals are
simple, no animal is ever complex because no animal is burdened by any
ideology. There is no “should”; the animal simply lives the way it
feels. It has no goal to achieve, nowhere to go, but just to live the
gift of life that has been given to it.</p><p><br></p><p>Simplicity is animal-like – the same purity, the same innocence. One

thought to be the man of character – virtuous, religious. He is not – he
is a dead man. If your present has to follow the past, how can you be
alive? The present has to have its say, sing its song, dance its dance,
unburdened, untethered to the past. There is no necessity to be
consistent with the past. The spontaneous man is always inconsistent –
bound to be, because each moment has to be decisive on its own. No
moment has to be decided by another moment, neither of the past nor of
the future.</p><p><br></p><p>There are two kinds of dead people: one, who is dominated by the
past; another, who is dominated</p><p>by the future. But both kill their present, hence both are dead. The
spontaneous man knows only one time, and that is this moment; there is
no other time for him.</p><p><br></p><p>These three things are the foundations of sahaja. It is one of the
most significant approaches towards life. Sahaja means Tao. So live like
animals, live like trees, live like small children, moment to moment.
The child is laughing one moment and crying another moment and has no
confusion about it, that he is being inconsistent. One moment he says,
“I will never see you again” – he is so angry. Another moment he is
sitting in your lap and has completely forgotten what he had said just a
moment before.</p><p><br></p><p>This moment-to-momentness makes one free, alive, total.</p><p><br></p><p>——– ******** ——–</p><p><br></p><p>Deva means divine, aggeya means the unknowable. God is not known, has
never been known, will never be known. God cannot be reduced to
knowledge – God remains love. God is something that happens through the
heart and not through the mind; hence the impossibility of knowing.
Knowledge is the function of the mind; you cannot love through the mind.
And in the same way you cannot know through the heart. The heart loves –
the mind knows. God is available only through the heart. You can love
God, you can be God, because love leads one to being, but not to
knowledge. If you really love you become it.</p><p><br></p><p>The real lovers lose their separate identities; they become one. Even
if their bodies are separate, even though they function as separate
individuals, somewhere on a deeper level they are no more separate, they
are bridged, as if there is one soul in two bodies, or it will be even
better to say: two bodies in one soul. But love never becomes knowledge.
That’s why man has loved woman down the ages and has not yet known what
a woman is. Woman has loved man for centuries, but has not known exactly
what a man is. There is no way of knowing.</p><p><br></p><p>God is the ultimate love affair. These small love affairs that happen
between man and woman, between man and man, woman and woman, are just
preparations for the ultimate love affair, just steps to the door of the
divine. But each love leads you towards prayer. Prayer is love with
God.</p><p><br></p><p>So God cannot be known... it is an absolute truth that God cannot be
known. It is not that God is unknown, because anything that is unknown
can become known someday. The moon was unknown; now the moon is known.
Science has changed many unknowns into knowns. So God is not only
unknown – God is unknowable, cannot be reduced to knowledge ever. Its
unknowableness is its intrinsic nature. It is impossible... it is as
impossible as seeing through the ears and hearing through the eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>Knowledge relates to the mind. Knowledge means that you are separate
from the object known. Knowledge implies separation. Knowledge means
that the knower is there, the known is there, and between the two there
is a certain kind of relationship happening. Knowledge is a relationship
between the two. Love is the experience of becoming one; it is not
between the two. Love is not a communication, but a communion. Knowledge
is a communication, knowledge is a dialogue. Love is silence. There is
no “I,” no “thou.”</p><p>This is the mystery of existence. It is good and it is immensely
beautiful that it cannot be reduced to knowledge, because once something
becomes known it becomes mundane. Once something becomes known we cannot
have any wonder about it any more. Wonder is killed by knowledge.</p><p><br></p><p>God means the ultimate mystery of existence; it cannot be killed. One
can go on wondering and wondering and wondering and there is no end to
it; it keeps man wondering. And wonder has immense beauty because in the
moment of wonder you become a child again, in the moment of wonder you
are innocent again. When you know, you are no more innocent. Knowledge
corrupts you, makes you cunning and clever. You become knowledgeable, it
gives you ego. Wonder, and the ego disappears, and with the ego all its
trips are gone. You know nothing. In the state of wonder you are in the
state of not-knowing, and that not-knowing is immense. Knowledge is
always limited, non- knowledge is unlimited. Knowledge can be increased,
decreased – innocence cannot be increased, cannot be decreased.</p><p><br></p><p>By giving you this name I am simply giving you an indication to
become more and more ignorant, to become utterly ignorant. When one is
ignorant one is full of heart. Then the heart really beats, then one
really breathes. And then one is in tune with the source again... one
has fallen into nature and its harmony again.</p><p><br></p><p>——– ******** ——–</p><p><br></p><p>Deva means divine, sugita means a song – a divine song. Life should
not be taken seriously. The moment one starts taking life seriously one
becomes calculative, and to be calculative is to miss all. Life belongs
to those people who are non-calculative. Life does not belong to
arithmetic – it belongs to art. Life is known only through being
sensitive, aesthetic, vulnerable. Life cannot be approached through
logic. The door to life is not logic but love. Anything that makes one
serious is part of death. Anything that makes one sing, dance, laugh,
love, is part of life.</p><p><br></p><p>Millions of people are really dead. They breathe and they go on doing
their things day in, day out, but they are not alive – living, but not
alive. Their flame is burning very low. They don’t know any inspiration.
They don’t know any song bursting through their souls. They have never
seen any arousal in their being, they have never moved to any higher
plenitudes of consciousness. They only crawl and creep; they never soar
high. Yes, they are living but it is a pseudo kind of life.</p><p><br></p><p>Life happens only when you become a song, you become a dance, when
you start blooming. Life is life only when there is a great inspiration
in you; and remember, inspiration is not excitement. Because people are
bored they seek and search for excitement; because people are dead they
seek and search for excitement. Anything that excites them makes them
feel a little unburdened, but again they are back in their bored
state.</p><p><br></p><p>Inspiration is a totally different phenomenon. Excitement comes from
the outside; inspiration comes from the inside. That is the very meaning
of the word “inspiration”: it comes from your inner core, it grows like
a tree in you. Excitement is momentary, inspiration is a continuity.</p><p><br></p><p>People are bored, hence they search for excitement – any kind of
excitement; through sex, through drugs or through traveling, through
violence. If they cannot commit violence then at least they can see it
on the TV or in the films, or they can read a detective novel. That is a
vicarious way of living</p><p>violence. That’s why whenever there is a war people become very
excited. This shows that life is being lived at the very lowest stage.
People need constant props from the outside to remain a little excited,
otherwise life is dull, meaningless.</p><p><br></p><p>Inspiration is an inner flow, an inner song... as if one is
constantly humming inside, singing inside, dancing inside. A man who
knows the way of inspiration never seeks excitement. There is no need –
he is not bored at all, he is living at the maximum. His life is
ecstatic; hence there is no need for any excitement.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the meaning of your name. I would like you to become a divine
song, an inner humming, an inner chanting, an inner dance that
continues.</p><p><br></p><p>Whatsoever you are doing on the outside, it still continues like an
undercurrent; like a small stream it goes on flowing. Slowly slowly you
can feel it even while you are engaged in work, occupied, doing things –
cooking, cleaning, taking care or whatsoever – but you can feel it
constantly. And whenever you have time you can close your eyes and you
can listen to it, you can be it.</p><p><br></p><p>And this is possible, because I see a song that is just waiting,
which needs just a little help, a little persuasion. And that’s my work
here: to persuade people to laugh, to love, to live.</p><p><br></p><p>——– ******** ——–</p><p><br></p><p>Deva means divine, prashanti means silence, deep silence – a deep
divine silence. Man can cultivate silence but then it is neither deep
nor divine. Man can practice a kind of silence. It remains human,
practiced, it remains just like an outer layer of your being. Deep down
you go on boiling.</p><p><br></p><p>You can see many people who look silent but deep down they are
getting madder and madder every day. They go on repressing: first they
repress from others, then slowly slowly they start repressing from
themselves. That’s how the unconscious is created. If a person never
represses anything he will not have any unconscious mind. The
unconscious mind is just a part of the mind that you don’t want to look
at, that you are afraid to look at, that you are afraid to accept. All
that you have denied goes on accumulating there. It is a kind of
basement where you go on throwing all the rubbishy things that you don’t
know how to get rid of. You don’t want to keep them there – they are
ugly and you don’t want anybody to see them in your house – and you
don’t know how to get rid of them, so the only possible way seems to be
to hide them somewhere in a dark corner where nobody will see. Slowly
slowly you start avoiding that dark corner; you don’t go to that side.
You start forgetting about it – you want to forget about it; that’s how
the unconscious mind is created. The unconscious mind is a man-created
phenomenon.</p><p><br></p><p>If a man never represses anything – rather than throwing things in
the basement he tries to understand them – there will be only
consciousness in him and his whole house will be full of light, because
through understanding, whatsoever is useless dissolves. Understanding is
a fire. Understanding is one of the greatest energies in the world. Just
by understanding something totally, it is burnt; it simply evaporates.
You need not repress it. You cannot even find it, so how can you repress
it?</p><p><br></p><p>And if something is valuable, if something is part of your inner
nature, then understanding cleanses it, bums that which is not natural
to you and cleanses and purifies that which is natural to you.</p><p>Understanding is a double-edged sword: it cuts the unessential, the
pseudo, and it sharpens the essential and the natural. Understanding is
a great miracle, the secret of all magic, of all transformation, of all
alchemy.</p><p><br></p><p>So if somebody represses his tensions he can create a kind of silence
which will only be on the surface. But he will know that the enemy is
still there and fully alive and will assert itself someday, whenever the
time arrives, and will not only assert itself but will assert itself
with a vengeance.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why you see these things happening: a silent man suddenly
murders somebody. One never even thought that he would be a murderer.
You had lived with him so long, you had known him – he was so beautiful
and so sweet and so gentlemanly – and one day suddenly in the morning
newspaper you see he has murdered someone or committed suicide. Seems
almost unbelievable, but it is unbelievable because we don’t know his
inner story. The inner story is that on the surface he was maintaining a
face, a mask, and deep down he was just the opposite. He carried it as
far as was humanly possible; then the limit came. Either one goes mad or
commits a murder, commits suicide or something like that. That’s not
true silence.</p><p><br></p><p>True silence is when you don’t cultivate it but on the contrary you
start looking into your anguish, anxiety, tensions, thoughts, all of
your mad mind... when you look into it deeply, perceptively,
sympathetically, lovingly, because you want to understand. It is your
mind and you want to understand it, because without understanding it you
will never be wise, without understanding it you will never become known
to yourself; there is no possibility of self-knowledge. And without
self-knowledge all other kinds of knowledge are just futile.</p><p><br></p><p>So try to understand your mind. Don’t condemn it, don’t repress it.
Give it full play... allow it. Bring all that is thrown into the
basement back into the consciousness. Allow everything to come to the
surface so you can see, watch, observe, analyze, look into, with no
prejudice, with no antagonism. Because if you have even a slight
antagonism it will not come up, it will hide.</p><p><br></p><p>To be friendly with one’s mind is one of the greatest steps in
self-transformation. And all the religions of the world have been
teaching just the opposite. Not Jesus, not Buddha, but the priests and
the pundits and the people who have created Christianity and Buddhism
and Hinduism – the people who are really politicians in the name of
religion – these people have been teaching you to condemn your mind, to
repress your mind. They have driven the whole of humanity insane, they
have made the whole earth a madhouse.</p><p><br></p><p>My work here is totally different, diametrically opposite; hence they
are all angry with me. If I succeed then there will be no possibility of
any priesthood in the future, no possibility of exploiting humanity and
driving people mad.</p><p><br></p><p>And this is the fundamental law of dissolving all kinds of madnesses:
try to understand everything that arises in you with great love, with
great caring. And you will be surprised – if you understand it, two
things are possible: if it is useless to your growth it will be burnt
and nothing will be found, not even a trace; if it is helpful to your
growth, beneficial to you, it will be strengthened, nourished, it will
start growing.</p><p><br></p><p>Then comes prashanti – then comes real, deep silence and that silence
is very alive. It is not the silence of a cemetery, it is the silence of
music, it is the silence of a garden. It is the silence which</p><p>throbs with life. It is a silence that can sing, that can dance. It
is a silence that can be creative; in fact it becomes creativity. It is
silence that wants to share itself with others, a silence that wants to
give itself to others. It is a silence that becomes love.</p><p><br></p><p>——– ******** ——–</p><p><br></p><p>Deva means divine, nutano means new. Life is always new, it is never
old; only the mind becomes old. The mind is always old, it is never new.
Hence life and mind never meet. One is always old, the other is always
new. How can they meet? Where can they meet? The mind cannot be new,
life cannot be old; there is no possibility of any bridge between the
two. So those who live in the mind cannot be alive, and those who want
be alive have to be courageous enough to come out of the mind and
live.</p><p><br></p><p>The mind gives a kind of security, safety, because it moves only in
the familiar. It is a very cowardly mechanism, very orthodox. Because it
moves in the familiar it feels good – you know everything, you know the
whole territory, you are efficient. Life always demands learning: you
have to learn moment to moment. You are always in the process of
learning with life. Life never gives you a chance to become
knowledgeable. It goes on changing so fast that by the time you know
something it is already out of date, it is no more relevant. Life has
moved ahead. Life creates new questions and the mind goes on repeating
old answers.</p><p><br></p><p>To be a sannyasin means: start inquiring into this phenomenon.
Scrutinize your mind and see yourself that it is always old. It is not
in its nature to be new. The mind means memory. How can the memory be
the new? The mind means the experienced, the mind means that which was
yesterday. Yesterday has left a few traces in your memory; that is your
mind. And if one lives in the mind, yesterday demands your today also to
be like it and your tomorrow also to follow in the same track. Then you
go on missing life and slowly slowly you start living in the mind.
That’s what madness is: to live in the mind irrespective of life, to
live completely in fantasy which is absolutely irrelevant to the reality
outside. That’s what madness isl</p><p><br></p><p>To be sane means to live with the reality as it is. To be sane means
not to live through the mind. Use the mind – it has certain utilities,
but those utilities are only technological. Use the mind for
technological ends but don’t use it for living purposes. It is a good
mechanism, like a computer, so when you need some information about the
past, consult it, but don’t let it hinder your life. Keep it aside. Live
fresh, not through the memory, not through conclusions, not through
knowledge. Live utterly nude, innocent, like a child... with open eyes,
with no knowledge, with wonder and awe, and you will be surprised
because you will confront God immediately.</p><p><br></p><p>To live without the mind is to know God. To live in the mind is to
live without knowing that which surrounds you. The man who lives through
the mind is the irreligious man. The religious man is one who lives
without the mind, never allows the mind to interfere in his life, keeps
his mind aside for other purposes. The mind is a good library, a good
Encyclopedia Britannica. Yes, sometimes it is needed – one can consult
it. Consult it, thank it, but don’t let it become your master; let it
remain your servant. It is a good servant and a very dangerous
master.</p><p><br></p><p>——– ******** ——–</p><p>[A sannyasin couple have just arrived. The woman says: I feel like
I’m too active all the time. I always go to things and never let them
come into me. It’s like I don’t live moment to moment. It’s the trouble
between my partner and me.]</p><p><br></p><p>Nothing to be worried about – I need a few active people too! Just
get involved in the ashram activities; nothing is wrong. You have the
energy, that’s why, and if you try to become passive, that will be
repressing it. You have to use it in the right, creative way. And it is
good – to have more energy is a blessing! It can become a curse if you
don’t know where to put it, how to use it; then it can drive you
neurotic. If energy is used rightly it becomes creation; if it is not
used rightly then it becomes restlessness.</p><p><br></p><p>So don’t be worried, I need so much energy – so much work has to be
done in the world. So don’t make a problem of it – just put it into the
work.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part22>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

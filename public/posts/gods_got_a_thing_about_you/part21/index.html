Meaning has disappeared from man’s life. These three hundred years have seen it disappearing slowly slowly. Now man stands utterly devoid of meaning. And he is very hollow, naturally. He feels there is no purpose in life; nothing seems to make sense any more. This is one of the greatest crises that man has ever faced.\nEither man will die and will not be able to survive this crisis or man will have a new orientation, will start living in a new way, with a new style, with a new context. Either man will not prove strong enough to go through this crisis of meaninglessness and will Commit suicide, or he will be able to bring a new meaning. The old is gone. The old was fictitious; it had to go someday. The old meaning that man has lived with for centuries was very childish. It was just as children playing with toys are so happy, but one day they come to know that toys are toys and suddenly they will feel lost.\nThat’s what has happened: man has come of age. All the old toys make no sense any more. In these three hundred years something immensely valuable has happened: the old meaning is dead and the new is not born yet – and we are in the gap.\nSannyas is an effort to give a new meaning to your life, a new way to discover purpose. All the old religions are still beating the old drums. And they know that man cannot feel any attraction again for those old toys, but they are desperate and they don’t know what else to do. They cannot conceive of a new meaning. They cannot live without meaning so all they can conceive is bringing the old meaning back. But it can’t be brought back. Man cannot be thrown back to his childhood again; it is impossible. Life always moves forward. Those dreams are gone, that paradise is lost.\nIt started with Galileo – he was the beginning of a great revolution. He said that the earth is not the center of existence, of the universe; and that was the first blow to the old toys. The earth had always been thought to be the center and the whole universe to be serving the earth. In the name of the\nearth man was at the center, the very center of existence; the whole universe was to serve man. Man had dignity, superiority. He was just a little below the angels: just one step more and he would be an angel; two steps more and he would be a God. Paradise was not far away. Life had a certain context. But Galileo said that the earth is not the center... and he was right. The old toy was taken.\nOnce the earth was no more the center, man was just ordinary. He was no more powerful, he was no more in the higher position, just below the angels; suddenly God was very far away. The universe was big and the earth was so small – the sun is sixty thousand times bigger, and this is a very mediocre sun; then there are other suns, millions of them. Suddenly man was lost. He belonged to a very very mediocre sun and to a very very small planet, earth... almost negligible, of no significance. That was the beginning of a great revolution. Man was dethroned.\nAnd then came Kepler and he said that even the sun is not the center – the sun itself is moving around some bigger sun. The earth was thrown even further away... almost of no value. Then came Darwin and he said that man is not just below the angels, he is just an evolution of the monkey. That was a great blow. Man had always thought of himself as the son of God; now he was nothing more than the son of a monkey, a baboon, a chimpanzee. His own image fell into pieces. This went on and on.…\nThen Marx said that consciousness is just a by-product; in reality there is no soul. Man is only matter. Then Freud said that there is no reason; man lives irrationally, at the mercy of the unconsCious, is not the maSter of his own life. It is impossible to think that he can be the master of existence – he is not even the master of his own body, of his own mind. Nine-tenths of his mind is unconscious, irrational, and he is just a victim. He is just fulfilling a certain program that has been given by blind nature to him. All Buddhas, all Christs, Krishnas, simply disappeared and became myths; they had never existed. And it went on and on.\nNow, the ultimate is B.F. Skinner who says that man has no freedom, no dignity, that we have to drop the whole idea of man’s freedom, dignity, etcetera. All nonsense! And Delgado says that man is just a machine. We have to accept it, we have to be courageous enough to accept it – that man is just a machine, a small electrical instrument.\nIn these three hundred years from Galileo to Delgado, all meaning, all dignity, all purpose has disappeared. Delgado says we should not ask the question, “What is man?” We should only ask what we want to make of him. Man is a machine – we can make anything out of him.\nThis is the situation and in this situation a great insight is needed again which can make life meaningful. Man cannot live by bread alone and man cannot live by science alone either. Man needs religion, but the religion cannot be of the past. It cannot be Christianity, it cannot be Judaism, it cannot be Hinduism – they are all out of date, their days are over. We can take insights from them, we can pick a few points, beautiful insights out of them, but their systems are no more meaningful. Anything that was evolved before Galileo cannot become significant again.\nA new kind of religion and a new kind of consciousness and a new man needs to be given birth to. That’s what sannyas is all about: it is an effort to introduce meaning, not through outer props – that the earth is the center, that man is just below the angels, that God created man in his own image... these are just childish props – but through the recognition that man has the seed to become, to grow.\nMan has the seed of infinity in him, and that seed needs no outer props. It simply needs a meditative energy to surround the seed. Just as a child needs a mother’s womb, the new man needs the womb of meditation. A great meditative energy is needed, and out of that meaning will start entering life again. And this meaning will not be of toys; it will not be based on any ideology; it will be based on your existential experience.\nSo, here, entering into sannyas means you are helping a tremendous movement to bring a new man on the earth. With that enthusiasm, the work has to be done upon yourself. It is not only a question of you; it is a question of a new humanity, the very survival of humanity.\nSo I will give you this name: Deva Artha – divine meaning... and that has to be searched for, explored. It is a beautiful adventure to explore meaning in your life. There is meaning but it is not available on the surface. One has to dive deep, one has to go to the very center. It is not in the sun, it is not in heaven, it is not in the stars; it is in you!\nWe should forget looking for meaning in the outside world. We have to move into the inner. The journey that is extrovert is the journey of science; the journey of introversion is the journey of religion. And man has both: an outer side and an inner side. The outer side cannot exist alone – it needs to have an inner to it. Inevitably the inner is there, but science has completely denied it. It has to be introduced into life again. Not only has it to be introduced; it has to become the very central core. The outer should be in the service of the inner, then meaning arises. When the inner is in the service of the outer, meaning disappears.\n——– ******** ——–\nDeva Layo – “utterly drowned in God”.It happens through love, because love is the only intoxicant\nthat is capable of drowning you utterly. It is only through love that one can evaporate, and only when the ego evaporates does God become available. One has to die for God to be; less than that is not of much help.\nJesus says, “Until you are born again.” That means that a death is a must. And only after that death\nwill a new life start. And that new life will not be ego-oriented, that new life will not be yours – it will be divine. God will live through you, and life is significant only when God lives through you. When you live, you live alone, and it is miserable. When God lives through you it has immense beauty and splendor. Then each moment is a joyous moment. Then the very flavor of life is rejoicing. But one has to do one thing: one has to stake oneself totally, one has to risk.\nThat is the meaning of “layo”: risking oneself totally, drowning oneself totally, becoming intoxicated and mad. Only then do we go beyond the so-called boundaries of the ego. And once we have seen something beyond the boundaries of the ego, we cannot fall back – that is impossible. Just a glimpse of the beyond and one is caught... caught in a tremendous energy and pull. A new law starts functioning as if one starts being pulled upwards – just the complementary law to gravitation, opposite to it but complementary. I call it grace. Gravitation pulls you down towards the earth; grace pulls you up, towards the sky. But for that one thing has to be done: our chains with the earth have to be broken.\nThose chains are the basic constituents of our ego, hence the ego is always afraidof drowning,\nof death, of getting lost. It is afraid of love for the same reason, because love is the beginning of prayer. It is afraid of prayer. And out of fear it denies. It says,\n“There is no God.” It says, “There is no meaning in prayer.” It says, “Meditation is all nonsense.” Out of fear, all these denials.\nI don’t say, “Believe in prayer,” and I don’t say, “Believe in meditation or in God”; I say, “Experiment.’ There is no need to believe. They are truths – just experiment and the truth itself convinces one. There is no need to believe. Belief is needed only when something is untrue. When something is true, belief is pointless. You cannot disbelieve or believe the truth. The truth is – it is self-evident.\nTo be a sannyasin means to go into this great experiment of love, prayer, meditation, God, existence. Not to experiment with existence is to live in a useless way, is to live surrounded by trivia. To experiment with God is to start living truly authentically. The word is not important – one may call it God, one may call it truth or beauty or love or nirvana; it doesn’t matter. One thing is certain, that the circumference is not all; there is a center to it, and one should not leave this earth without knowing the center. Then life is fulfilled.\nAnd that’s my whole effort here, to help you to move towards the center. And the closer you come, the more blissful you become, the more silent you become. The moment you reach the center of your being then all the Buddhas and all the Christs are proved true; you have become a witness to them. Then only is a man really religious – not by belief, but by his own experience!\n——– ******** ——–\n[A sannyasin says: At the first lecture I attended here I had the beginning of a dying experience and I stopped it because of fear. What can I do?]\nYou always stop it, mm? But you will not be able to stop it for long. It will be coming again and again, and each time it is going deeper and each time you are learning to go into it a little bit more; that’s how it happens. Nothing can be done about it; it will take its own course. One day it is going to happen and that day will be of great celebration.\nBut it is happening. Don’t be in a hurry and don’t try to speed it up. Leave it to itself. Naturally, slowly, allow it to happen.…\n——– ******** ——–\n[A sannyasin, arriving to stay forever, says: It feels new – it’s like taking sannyas again.]\nThat’s good! It is always new. It is good... if I always remain new for you, it is good. That means you are discovering me more and more, that the discovery is going on, that the exploration continues. The moment a relationship, any relationship – between two lovers, between the Master and the disciple, between two friends, any relationship – starts getting old and when you start feeling it is the same, you have stopped growing in it. Hence it seems old. It is no more an exploration. You have taken it for granted. You have stopped at a certain point.\nA relationship becomes old only when you stop it. If it remains alive, flowing, it never becomes old. And this relationship that exists between me and you should never become old; there is no need for it to become old. Only then can it help you to grow to the ultimate. God is ever new... so has to be our life. Each moment, look again, allow yourself to be surprised, feel wonder and awe.\nAnd never start feeling that it is going to be the same tomorrow. It is never the same; it is only the mind. Because the mind does not want to learn any more. Learning is hard, arduous. And learning means that you will have to drop your old knowledge; then only can learning continue. The mind is more interested in knowledge than in learning. If it ever learns, it only learns to gather knowledge, but its interest is in knowledge. Knowledge means of the past, old, dead. The mind is interested in the old and the dead because the old and the dead can be manipulated, controlled.\nThe mind is not interested in learning because learning can never be controlled and manipulated. Learning means opening to the future. Learning is always future-oriented, and knowledge past- oriented. Knowledge gives security, safety, and a great feeling of ego, of “I know.” But it makes you feel bored too, because then it is always the same and you are moving in a circle; you are a gramophone record. Security is there but there is boredom too. Safety is there but there is boredom too, and boredom is hell. If one wants to remain alive, interested, exploring, then one has to drop the security that knowledge gives. One has to know the insecurity of Learning, and one has to remain childlike.\nAny relationship in which you can remain childlike will be of tremendous value. And this relationship particularly, between me and you, has to remain always innocent, of Learning, of exploration. Never take it for granted, never make it old.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2660","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/gods_got_a_thing_about_you/part21/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/gods_got_a_thing_about_you/>God\'s Got a Thing About you</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">21</h1><div class=post-meta>13 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2660 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Gods_Got_a_Thing_About_you/part21.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part20>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

disappeared from man’s life. These three hundred years have seen it
disappearing slowly slowly. Now man stands utterly devoid of meaning.
And he is very hollow, naturally. He feels there is no purpose in life;
nothing seems to make sense any more. This is one of the greatest crises

props. It simply needs a meditative energy to surround the seed. Just as
a child needs a mother’s womb, the new man needs the womb of meditation.
A great meditative energy is needed, and out of that meaning will start
entering life again. And this meaning will not be of toys; it will not
be based on any ideology; it will be based on your existential
experience.</p><p><br></p><p>So, here, entering into sannyas means you are helping a tremendous
movement to bring a new man on the earth. With that enthusiasm, the work
has to be done upon yourself. It is not only a question of you; it is a
question of a new humanity, the very survival of humanity.</p><p><br></p><p>So I will give you this name: Deva Artha – divine meaning... and that
has to be searched for, explored. It is a beautiful adventure to explore
meaning in your life. There is meaning but it is not available on the
surface. One has to dive deep, one has to go to the very center. It is
not in the sun, it is not in heaven, it is not in the stars; it is in
you!</p><p><br></p><p>We should forget looking for meaning in the outside world. We have to
move into the inner. The journey that is extrovert is the journey of
science; the journey of introversion is the journey of religion. And man
has both: an outer side and an inner side. The outer side cannot exist
alone – it needs to have an inner to it. Inevitably the inner is there,
but science has completely denied it. It has to be introduced into life
again. Not only has it to be introduced; it has to become the very
central core. The outer should be in the service of the inner, then
meaning arises. When the inner is in the service of the outer, meaning
disappears.</p><p><br></p><p>——– ******** ——–</p><p><br></p><p>Deva Layo – “utterly drowned in God”.<span class=s4></span>It
happens through love, because love is the only intoxicant</p><p>that is capable of drowning you utterly. It is only through love that
one can evaporate, and only when the ego evaporates does God become
available. One has to die for God to be; less than that is not of much
help.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus says, “Until you are born again.<span class=s4></span>” That
means that a death is a must. And only after that death</p><p>will a new life start. And that new life will not be ego-oriented,
that new life will not be yours – it will be divine. God will live
through you, and life is significant only when God lives through you.
When you live, you live alone, and it is miserable. When God lives
through you it has immense beauty and splendor. Then each moment is a
joyous moment. Then the very flavor of life is rejoicing. But one has to
do one thing: one has to stake oneself totally, one has to risk.</p><p><br></p><p>That is the meaning of “layo”: risking oneself totally, drowning
oneself totally, becoming intoxicated and mad. Only then do we go beyond
the so-called boundaries of the ego. And once we have seen something
beyond the boundaries of the ego, we cannot fall back – that is
impossible. Just a glimpse of the beyond and one is caught... caught in
a tremendous energy and pull. A new law starts functioning as if one
starts being pulled upwards – just the complementary law to gravitation,
opposite to it but complementary. I call it grace. Gravitation pulls you
down towards the earth; grace pulls you up, towards the sky. But for
that one thing has to be done: our chains with the earth have to be
broken.</p><p><br></p><p>Those chains are the basic constituents of our ego, hence the ego is
always afraid<span class=s4></span>of drowning,</p><p>of death, of getting lost. It is afraid of love for the same reason,
because love is the beginning of prayer. It is afraid of prayer. And out
of fear it denies. It says,</p><p><br></p><p>“There is no God.” It says, “There is no meaning in prayer.” It says,
“Meditation is all nonsense.” Out of fear, all these denials.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t say, “Believe in prayer,” and I don’t say, “Believe in
meditation or in God”; I say, “Experiment.’ There is no need to believe.
They are truths – just experiment and the truth itself convinces one.
There is no need to believe. Belief is needed only when something is
untrue. When something is true, belief is pointless. You cannot
disbelieve or believe the truth. The truth is – it is self-evident.</p><p><br></p><p>To be a sannyasin means to go into this great experiment of love,
prayer, meditation, God, existence. Not to experiment with existence is
to live in a useless way, is to live surrounded by trivia. To experiment
with God is to start living truly authentically. The word is not
important – one may call it God, one may call it truth or beauty or love
or nirvana; it doesn’t matter. One thing is certain, that the
circumference is not all; there is a center to it, and one should not
leave this earth without knowing the center. Then life is fulfilled.</p><p><br></p><p>And that’s my whole effort here, to help you to move towards the
center. And the closer you come, the more blissful you become, the more
silent you become. The moment you reach the center of your being then
all the Buddhas and all the Christs are proved true; you have become a
witness to them. Then only is a man really religious – not by belief,
but by his own experience!</p><p><br></p><p>——– ******** ——–</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin says: At the first lecture I attended here I had the
beginning of a dying experience and I stopped it because of fear. What
can I do?]</p><p><br></p><p>You always stop it, mm? But you will not be able to stop it for long.
It will be coming again and again, and each time it is going deeper and
each time you are learning to go into it a little bit more; that’s how
it happens. Nothing can be done about it; it will take its own course.
One day it is going to happen and that day will be of great
celebration.</p><p><br></p><p>But it is happening. Don’t be in a hurry and don’t try to speed it
up. Leave it to itself. Naturally, slowly, allow it to happen.…</p><p><br></p><p>——– ******** ——–</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin, arriving to stay forever, says: It feels new – it’s
like taking sannyas again.]</p><p><br></p><p>That’s good! It is always new. It is good... if I always remain new
for you, it is good. That means you are discovering me more and more,
that the discovery is going on, that the exploration continues. The
moment a relationship, any relationship – between two lovers, between
the Master and the disciple, between two friends, any relationship –
starts getting old and when you start feeling it is the same, you have
stopped growing in it. Hence it seems old. It is no more an exploration.
You have taken it for granted. You have stopped at a certain point.</p><p>A relationship becomes old only when you stop it. If it remains
alive, flowing, it never becomes old. And this relationship that exists
between me and you should never become old; there is no need for it to
become old. Only then can it help you to grow to the ultimate. God is
ever new... so has to be our life. Each moment, look again, allow
yourself to be surprised, feel wonder and awe.</p><p><br></p><p>And never start feeling that it is going to be the same tomorrow. It
is never the same; it is only the mind. Because the mind does not want
to learn any more. Learning is hard, arduous. And learning means that
you will have to drop your old knowledge; then only can learning
continue. The mind is more interested in knowledge than in learning. If
it ever learns, it only learns to gather knowledge, but its interest is
in knowledge. Knowledge means of the past, old, dead. The mind is
interested in the old and the dead because the old and the dead can be
manipulated, controlled.</p><p><br></p><p>The mind is not interested in learning because learning can never be
controlled and manipulated. Learning means opening to the future.
Learning is always future-oriented, and knowledge past- oriented.
Knowledge gives security, safety, and a great feeling of ego, of “I
know.” But it makes you feel bored too, because then it is always the
same and you are moving in a circle; you are a gramophone record.
Security is there but there is boredom too. Safety is there but there is
boredom too, and boredom is hell. If one wants to remain alive,
interested, exploring, then one has to drop the security that knowledge
gives. One has to know the insecurity of Learning, and one has to remain
childlike.</p><p><br></p><p>Any relationship in which you can remain childlike will be of
tremendous value. And this relationship particularly, between me and
you, has to remain always innocent, of Learning, of exploration. Never
take it for granted, never make it old.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part20>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

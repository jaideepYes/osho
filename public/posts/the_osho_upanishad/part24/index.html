You see yourself as in reality you are – not the mask but the original face, not the personality but your universal being. The meeting with the enlightened person creates a resonance, a certain vibration that reaches to the very depths of your being. Because you don’t know your self, it seems you have met this enlightened being before – because you don’t know your own enlightenment. It is your self nature. This is one dimension. But there is another dimension also. You have lived many lives, and it is impossible that you have not come across the awakened, the enlightened, the illuminated beings – perhaps many times.\nYou have met these strangers, these outsiders, on different paths, on different crossroads – the quality of enlightenment is the same. So if you loved me deeply enough, all those experiences –\nwhich were momentary, because you never lived with an enlightened being long enough; otherwise you would not be here – just passing moments, but even the shadows, the reflections, are revived again because the taste is the same.\nGautam Buddha is reported to have said, “You can taste the ocean from anywhere. It is always salty.” It does not make any difference whether it is the Atlantic or Pacific. So is the case with enlightenment: it is an ocean of consciousness, and the taste is immensely sweet, fulfilling, enlightening. And the person who is before you is no longer important. What is important is the invisible experience that he is carrying within himself.\nSo if you have passed a Gautam Buddha on a crossroad, or a Mahavira, or a Mahakashyap, or a Kabir, or a Farid – meeting me, all those momentary impressions on your being will be revived again and it will appear as if you have known me before, many many times in many many lives.\nBut the very apparent meaning is not true.\nI was not enlightened before this life. So even if you have met me, you have not met me – it was just an unconscious being like yourself. And you have been meeting thousands of people. I may have been one of those thousands of unconscious people that you came across – that is not significant.\nThe difficulty with enlightenment is that you can be enlightened only in one life, because that is your last life. Once you have become enlightened, you cannot come again into the human body. You are released from the prison, from the pain, from the anguish, from the meaningless, miserable existence. You are no more confined in any form; you enter into a formless universal consciousness. Once enlightened, your death is going to be the last death. In other words, only enlightened people die. The unenlightened ... very difficult – they go on coming back, they never die. Only the enlightened person can afford death; the unenlightened cannot afford it, he is not yet ready.\nLife is a school, and unless you have learned the lesson you will have to come back again and again to the same class. Once you have learned the lesson, passed the examination, then even if you want to come back into the class you will find all doors are closed for you. You have to move higher, to a different level of being.\nWe have moved from one form to another form. Man is the last form. Beyond man is a formless, oceanic consciousness.\nGautam Buddha says, “I will be coming back after twenty-five centuries.” He is simply giving a consolation. In his place I have come! But the taste is the same. He has not lied – in a sense; in a sense he has lied.\nJesus says, “I will be coming back.” Krishna says, “I will be coming back.” No enlightened person can come back.\nThen why are these people saying these things? They know they cannot come back. But people will be becoming enlightened – and enlightenment has no name. Whether it is in the body of Gautam\nBuddha or in the body of Krishna or in the body of Jesus or in the body of anybody else, it is the same phenomenon. So apparently they are lying, but fundamentally they are saying a very profound truth.\nPurna, that’s what you experienced when you first met me.\nYes, you have been meeting me before – in other enlightened people. But if they can say that they will be coming ... and I have to come, then I can say I was there ... just lying backwards. When you met Gautam Buddha you met me. The experience, not the body; not the skeleton but the consciousness.\nI was in Nagpur speaking in a Buddhist conference. I am not a Buddhist ... only Buddhists were invited to speak; I was the only one who was not a Buddhist. The president of the conference, Bhadant Anand Kausalyayan, was a little puzzled. I was just sitting next to him. He whispered in my ear, “Have you become a Buddhist?”\nI said, “I don’t need to be a Buddhist.”\nHe said, “Then why are you here in a Buddhist conference?” I said, “Because I am a buddha.”\nHe said, “My God. Then you should be presiding.”\nI said, “That’s true. Come down. You are only a Buddhist. And I have just come by the way after twenty-five centuries, to see how things are going.”\nBut he could not absorb the shock of my saying that I am the buddha. In the night he came to meet me in the house of a friend, where I was staying. He was a common friend; he was his friend also. And he said, “I had to come, because since the morning I have not been able to drop the idea that a man can say with such authority that he is the buddha. I have been a Buddhist for fifty years, and I don’t have the guts to say that I am a buddha; I am still a Buddhist, trying to follow the principles of Buddha. And you don’t seem to follow any principles at all.”\nI said, “Those principles are for Buddhists. Buddhas make principles, they don’t follow them. And I can say it with authority because Gautam Buddha himself has said that he will be coming after twenty-five centuries. Do you think he was lying?”\nHe said, “No, I cannot think that way.”\n“Do you think he will come exactly in the same body? That body you have burned. Do you think he will be born as a prince? – because now there are no kings. Where are you going to find a beautiful woman like Yashodhara for him to marry?”\nHe said, “My God, in all these details ... naturally they cannot be repeated, because to repeat all those details means to bring that whole century – the kingdoms, the people ... because a single man is not an island, he is connected.”\nNow Buddha was the son of a king, Shuddhodhana. I said, “First you will have to find Shuddhodhana, and what about Shuddhodhana’s father? It is going to be difficult. You will have to find Yashodhara. What about Yashodhara’s father?\n“You will have to manage a son to be born, and on the night the son is born Buddha has to be exactly twenty-nine years old and he has to escape in a golden chariot. Where are you going to find these things? You can do it in a drama, but in reality ... Trust me, I am the buddha – this time born to a different father, this time no Yashodhara, because last time it was enough. One has to learn from experience. This time no children, I cannot tolerate them; they are the nastiest people in the world.”\nHe said, “My God. You have made the thing such that one wants to feel that perhaps you are the Buddha.”\nI said, “It is not a question of feeling. I don’t depend on your feeling. I am the buddha, whether you feel it or not. There were many fools like you in Buddha’s time who never accepted him as the buddha, the enlightened, the awakened. It is up to you to be wise or to be a fool.”\nPurna, you must have come across me many times – not in this body, but you must have come across the same experience. Sometimes a Mohammedan, Farid; a weaver, Kabir; a shoemaker, Raidas. Sometimes a prince, Gautam; sometimes a businessman, Tuladhar. Sometimes a man ... sometimes a woman, like Rabiya al-Adabiya.\nEnlightenment is simply realizing one’s universal self. Whoever realizes it has the same taste – his eyes radiate the same light, his gestures have the same grace, he has the same beauty.\nIf you are receptive, meeting one enlightened person, you have met all the enlightened people who have happened in the whole history of man; not only the past, but even those who will happen in the future.\nIn the enlightened consciousness the past, the present, the future are all dissolved into a single moment.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nIT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DEFEND YOU, AND EQUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO DESERT YOU. I AM OVERWHELMINGLY AWARE OF HOW MUCH I OWE YOU AND HOW DEEPLY I LOVE YOU.\nIt is certainly impossible to defend me – unless you become enlightened. That is the only defense you can provide to the world.\nNo logical, no rational, no intellectual argumentation can defend me; but you can become enlightened, which is far easier. Then you will be my defense – the more souls are aflame, the more I am defended.\nAnd you say, “It is also impossible to desert you.”\nThat too is possible through the same method, enlightenment – you will be able to defend me and you will be able to desert me. Once you are enlightened, I can say goodbye. There is no need to hang around me. Before that, you cannot defend me and you cannot desert me.\nAnd the remaining question is absolutely absurd. You say you owe me so much – all bullshit. You owe nothing to me unless you are enlightened. What do you owe to me? I just enjoy telling stories\n... and you think you owe something to me? I just enjoy gossiping, telling jokes, talking about things which cannot be talked about – just an old habit. You don’t owe anything to me.\nYes, you will owe something to me when you become enlightened – just a thank you. That too need not be said. I will understand it.\nQuestion 3\nOH MY MASTER,\nI KNOW NOTHING, BUT I KNOW ONE THING – THAT YOU LOVE ME. THANK YOU, OSHO.\nJaya, you know that I love you, I know that you love me; and really there is nothing else to say – either from your side or from my side.\nSo we can take the next question. Question 4\nBELOVED OSHO,\nOFTEN MY FELLOW SANNYASINS ASK WHAT I THINK ABOUT A PARTICULAR EVENT THAT TOOK PLACE NEAR YOU, OR HOW I FEEL ABOUT THE ORGANIZATION AROUND YOU.\nBEING HERE WITH YOU, I FIND MYSELF MORE INTERESTED IN THAT EMPTINESS WHICH YOU SPEAK AROUND, THAT SPACE FROM WHERE YOU COME.\nOSHO, WILL YOU SPEAK TO MY FRIENDS ABOUT THE CRAZY EVENTS AND ACTIONS THAT ALWAYS SURROUND YOUR PRESENCE?\nThere are many things to be said about the question.\nFirst, there is no organization around me. I am against organizations because each organization kills the truth.\nThe ancient story is that a little devil came running to the master devil and said, “Master, what are you doing here wasting your time smoking a cigar? There on the earth one man has found the truth. And if the people of the earth come to know about the truth, that will be a calamity to us. Hell will be deserted. There will not be a single newcomer anymore. Something has to be done urgently!”\nBut the old devil went on smoking the Havana cigar. He said, “Calm down, my son. You are new. I have made every arrangement.”\nHe said, “But I am coming exactly from the spot! There is no arrangement!”\nHe said, “You don’t understand. There are already organizers around the man – priests, interpreters, organizers. A church is being made, and they are standing between the man and the masses. Whatever he says, they interpret it before it reaches to the people.\n“This is my old strategy. Try it, and it always succeeds. That’s how I have killed all the religions.”\nTruth has been found many times, but it has never been possible to make it available to the people. The organization becomes a wall – power seekers, hierarchies, bureaucracies. And the man who has found the truth – he is so alone in this crowd of scholars, priests, power seekers, interpreters; he finds himself absolutely helpless. Whatever he says they distort it. Whatever he says, something else reaches to the people.\nThere are others who are writing books, and these books will be worshipped, they will become holy books. Sculptors have arrived; they are making the statue of the man who has found the truth. Nobody is interested in the truth, everybody is interested in his own business. They worship the man, and worshipping is another form of crucifying.\nIf you are cultured, you worship; if you are uncultured, you crucify – but there is no difference between the two.\nThe worshippers say, “You are God incarnate. We will remember you forever. Our children will worship you. There will be temples all over the earth, your statues all over the world.”\nThe scribes are writing books, the writers are making great systems of thought.\nNobody listens to the man. In fact, nobody is there to listen to him. Everybody is there to exploit him.\nThe priest says, “Ask me. He is so far above that without mediators, there is no possibility of any communication.”\nJust recently the pope declared that anybody who confesses to God directly, without the mediation of a Catholic priest, is committing a grave sin. Strange – you cannot confess to God directly, it is a grave sin. First you have to go to the Catholic priest. Everything should move through proper channels; you have to tell the Catholic priest, and he will inform God, and God will inform him what punishment has to be given to you.\nThe old devil said, “You don’t be worried. I have my popes, Ayatolla Khomeiniacs, shankaracharyas, Acharya Tulsi’s – and all kinds of idiots are there. We need not be worried; just take a Havana cigar, relax. You are just new and don’t understand the business yet.”\nSo the first thing: I don’t have any organization. I don’t have any holy book. I don’t have any mediator. I don’t have any interpreter. Whatever you see as organization is not organization, it is simply functional; it is just like the post office.\nNow so many millions of people writing letters to each other ... some kind of arrangement has to be there; somebody has to sort out the letters, where they have to go. But the postmaster has not any authority, nor the postman, nor the postmaster general. Who knows the name of the postmaster general? It is just functional work.\nIn a good world, you will not know the name of the president of your country – it is a functional post. You will not know who is the prime minister – there is no need, it is simply functional. They should be doing their work, and they are needed just the way shoemakers are need, scavengers are needed. The president is not needed more than the plumber; in fact, the plumber is needed more than the president. The president is simply sitting there in the capital doing nothing, and when something goes wrong in your bathroom – which happens almost every day – then the plumber is needed. But nobody honors the plumber; the plumber has no authority, he has no power. And bogus people who are not doing anything have power.\nThat is the miracle of organization: Organization creates useless people, but makes everybody feel that without them the whole society will collapse.\nStalin never took a single holiday in his whole life, and he was one of the men who ruled longest. And when his daughter, Svetlana once asked him ... He must have been in a very good mood, which was rare. Svetlana was married to an Indian. She has told the story to me herself.\nStalin said that he cannot take any holiday because the holiday will make the whole country feel that the country can go perfectly well without him. And the truth is, the country will go perfectly well without him. He has to remain in the chair to make the country feel that without him, everything is going to collapse.\nThe whole bureaucracy makes you feel that without them everything is going to be wrong. This is their way of gaining power. And the people who are interested in power are the people who are the most empty, who are suffering from an inferiority complex. These are the most sick people in the world.\nI don’t have any organization. Just functionally, if only a hundred people can sit here and three hundred people come, then somebody has to prevent the two hundred, give them passes – “You come tomorrow.” But that does not make him powerful, so that you have to have his picture hanging in your house – “This man is no ordinary man; this man passes out tickets, worship him.” He is simply serving you, there is no question of power.\nSecondly, you are not asking your question. You are asking questions that your friends ask you.\nThis is dishonest. You are allowed to ask your question. And I know it is your question, but you don’t have the courage to say that “This is my question.”\nI used to live with a man for three years. He was an astrologer and a palmist. And it was an everyday experience that people will bring their own birth chart and will say, “This is my friend’s birth chart” – because if the man says something ugly nobody wants to hear it. If things are good it is good, if things are bad it is about the friend. But that man was very clever. He would say, “Good. Leave this chart here, and tomorrow bring your friend with you.” Now, it was a difficulty – where to find a friend? And who is going to be with him, to be unnecessarily in trouble?\nI said, “Why do you do that?”\nHe said, “This is an everyday thing. They come about other people, and these are their problems. But a person who has not the courage to say honestly that ‘This is my problem’ will not be able to solve it.”\n“Your friends ask you about the organization.” It is not true. It is your own question. There is no problem; why can’t you say, “I have a question about your organization”?\n“Friends ask about things that happen around You.” Strange. Why don’t those friends come themselves? All those friends have sent one representative.\nThings happen.\nWherever there is silence, a certain magic prevails.\nThe more profound the silence, the deeper is the magic.\nI have seen people changing so dramatically, so unbelievably – one could never have thought before that this man can become so peaceful, so loving; that so many flowers can grow in his consciousness, so that he becomes almost fragrant; that his life becomes a song, a dance, a celebration.\nIt is simply a question of resonance. Great musicians know it. A great musician can play on his sitar, and can keep another sitar in an empty room far away in another corner. And there comes a moment when he is really lost in playing his sitar that the other sitar – which is simply sitting there, nobody is playing it – starts resonating the same tune, vibrating.\nIn the old days that was one of the most important things before a man was called a master musician – if he could create resonance, only then was he a master; otherwise he was just an ordinary musician.\nThere are stories which look fictitious, but they are not – because now we know something scientifically, that they are possible.\nThe Indian classical music has different ragas for different purposes. There are ragas which can create light, fire; just an unlit lamp suddenly becomes aflame. A certain resonance, a certain hit of the vibrations creates the fire, and the flame comes up.\nNow – scientists say, and it has been followed by military experts – whenever soldiers pass on a bridge, their ordinary musical walk is broken. They are ordered not to walk the way they have been trained – thousands of people raising their left legs at the same time, creating the same sound. Because it was found in the first world war that many bridges were broken – and those bridges were able to carry bigger loads; just an army passing ... what happened? Just a certain rhythm of their legs falling on the bridge, and the bridge was gone, and the people were falling from the bridge.\nFirst it was thought to be just an accident, but when it started happening on many bridges then things were looked into. It was found that it is the sound of their musical march that gives a nervous breakdown to the poor bridge.\nYou say, “Crazy things happen around You.” That, too, is said by your friends. I have never seen any crazy thing happening around here. Yes, I have seen crazy people becoming sane; but in a crazy world to be sane looks like being crazy. Just go to a madhouse ...\nIt happened to a friend’s father. He is a special kind of insane person: for six months he is insane, and six months he is absolutely sane; periodically his pendulum moves. While he is sane he is always sick – this infection, that infection, and he is always going to the hospital, to the doctor, and the whole family is troubled. And when the six months pass and he becomes mad, he becomes healthy; in those six months, no infection, no illness. His weight goes higher, he looks radiant.\nAt four o’clock in the morning he wakes up the whole village, “Come on to the river!” He drags people out of their houses; “It is time! Go to the river.” Those six months when he is mad, he keeps the whole village taking a bath at least two times a day – morning and evening. He purchases so many fruits – because he has not to pay, his sons have to pay – and distributes them to everybody. Vegetables, fruits, sweets ... the whole town is happy when he is mad. Only his family is sick, ill – because he goes on taking money from the shop; even the small children of the house guard the shop and shout, “Mommy, father is taking money!”\nAnd he will say, “Shut up! Am I your father, or are you my father? This is my shop.” All that money goes in distributing sweets and fruits and things to anybody, whoever meets him on the way. But he is so happy, and the whole village is so happy. He disappears sometimes in those six months – just by chance he reaches the station, and if the train is there he will sit on it. Once he disappeared. Much searching was done, and he was not found – where he had gone, which train he had caught nobody knew.\nAnd all the ticket collectors and ticket checkers, all know him, so nobody bothers to ask for the ticket. He reached Agra – it is so far away from my village – he was feeling hungry.\nHe went to a shop. There is an Indian food, it is called khaja – it also means “eat it.”\nSo he asked what it was, and the shopkeeper said, “Khaja.” He said, “Okay,” and he started eating it. The shopkeeper said, “What are you doing?” He said, “Exactly what you said.” And he was so robust ... And the shopkeeper said, “This is strange.\nYou ask the name, and you finish the whole thing! You will have to come to the court.” A crowd gathered ... He said, “Listen, I am a stranger. I simply asked this fool what it is; he said khaja. I have eaten it, according to him. I am ready to go to any police station, to any court; such a name should not be given to a sweet.” In the court they found that he was out of his mind. They jailed him. He was sent to Lahore – because in those days Pakistan was not divided; now Lahore is in Pakistan. Lahore had the greatest madhouse of those days. After three, four months, his time was over. He was periodically mad and periodically sane; he became sane. He went to the superintendent and he said, “This is the situation: I go mad for six months, and for six months I am sane. Now my madness is gone. Now I remember it was not right to eat that thing; it is the name of the thing, he was not meaning that I had to eat it. But I was mad; now I am perfectly sane. And now there is great trouble” – because there were at least one thousand mad people in that madhouse. And he said, “When I was mad there was no problem – somebody was pulling my leg, somebody was sitting on my head;\nit was all okay. For mad people nothing is wrong, everything is right. But now that I am sane, it is very difficult to live with these one thousand mad people. Somebody comes and starts pulling my nose – and I am not doing anything to anybody! Somebody is sitting on my head ... and whatsoever they want to do they do. Somebody is taking my shirt, and I have to fight, and you cannot fight because they are all mad. And my trouble is that when I am mad I have energy, and when I am not mad I am a very sick person. Please release me.\nBut the superintendent said, “We cannot do anything against the court. You have to be here for six months.”\nHe said, “You don’t understand. When I was mad, it was okay; but now I am not mad. I am the only person here who is not mad. You just live one day inside the madhouse and you will understand my situation.” But nobody would listen to him. He was telling me, “In those two months of sanity in the insane house I suffered hell. But for four months when I was mad, it was heaven; it was such a joy to be with all those mad people, such a synchronicity – everything was right, nothing was wrong. But for those two months everything was wrong, nothing was right, and I was the only sufferer.”\nHere, nobody goes crazy. My people are the sanest people in the world.\nBut the world is crazy, and my people are few. And the world is big – they have the majority, they have the politicians, they have the governments, they have the churches.\nThey have everything in their hands, and they are not even alert that they are insane. To be in the mind is to be insane; mind is the place of insanity.\nOnly those people are really sane who have transcended the mind, who have gone beyond it into silence where no thoughts, no desires, no emotions, nothing exists. Only in that peace is your real health. And that kind of sanity happens here.\nSo tell your fictitious friends that people are going sane; and if they want to be sane, bring them here. But before you bring them, at least you should go sane.\nMind is crazy.\nThis is the difference between the ordinary psychology and the psychology I teach: the ordinary psychology says that mind can be sane or insane; and I say mind can only be normally insane or abnormally insane, but mind can never be sane.\nSanity is always above mind, beyond mind. And only very few people in the world have been blessed enough to be sane. But the mad crowd has treated them really badly ... poisoning Socrates, who is one of the sanest men possible. But it is the insane people who decide whether to poison him or not. Al-Hillaj Mansoor was killed by the insane people. Sarmad, one of the sanest men, was beheaded in New Delhi. The insane crowd was immensely happy to get rid of these sane people. Where everybody is sad, don’t rejoice; where everybody is miserable, don’t look blissful; where everybody is living in hell, don’t show your heart and the heaven that you have found there – otherwise you will be punished for it. It is a strange world. Here, those who are sane, blissful, blessed, are punished; those who are miserable, mad, are rewarded.\nQuestion 5\nBELOVED OSHO, IN POONA WHEN I FIRST TOOK SANNYAS, I FELT VERY YOUNG AND INNOCENT. I HAD A “YES” FOR EVERYTHING, AND WANTED TO LEARN TO BE A “GOOD” SANNYASIN. WATCHING OTHERS, I WAS LEARNING WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE TO BE A DISCIPLE.\nIN RAJNEESHPURAM, I FELT THAT AS LONG AS I WAS LOVING YOU, WHATEVER I DID THAT FELT APPROPRIATE WAS FINE – THINKING THAT I WAS A DISCIPLE, AND THE IMPORTANT THING WAS TO COME FROM THAT SPACE. OSHO, NOW IT FEELS LIKE THERE IS NO “BEING” YOUR DISCIPLE; THERE IS ONLY A NEVER-ENDING PROCESS OF BECOMING. IT LOOKS AS THOUGH THERE IS NO SITTING BACK, HAVING ALREADY BECOME “OSHO’S SANNYASIN”; THERE IS NOTHING BUT TAKING EACH STEP ONE AFTER ANOTHER, WALKING THIS PATH, THIS ENDLESS PATH.\nWILL YOU PLEASE SPEAK ON THESE CHANGES AND ON THIS JOURNEY WITH YOU?\nNityananda, you have described very accurately each step a disciple has to go through. This is the most important conclusion: that there is no question of just being a disciple, it is always becoming. You cannot come to a full stop; the journey is endless, and this is the beauty of the journey.\nFrom being to becoming is a tremendous quantum leap. If you look around in life, you will never find being anywhere; you will always find becoming.\nThe fallacy of being is created by language, it is the poverty of language. You see a roseflower ... you see it and you say, “What a beautiful flower.” But the flower is continuously flowering, it is never in a state of stopping anywhere.The tree is continuously growing; the word ‘tree’ is not right. In existence there are no nouns, there are only verbs. It will be very difficult to make a language only with verbs, but the truth is, existence has no nouns.\nA tree is in fact treeing, a river in fact is rivering. You are each moment growing – either growing old, the ordinary way of the world; or growing up, the way of my people. Growing old, you have not to do anything – you will grow old, biology will take care of it.\nGrowing up means a conscious alertness – so that the body goes on growing old, but your consciousness goes on growing upwards, growing up. But it is always growing; even in death a conscious being is growing.\nThe whole existence is a great verb, not a noun – not a stone, but a flower. And there is no end anywhere because there has never been any beginning. The very idea of beginning and end is just our mind projection. Otherwise, we are always in the middle – never at the beginning, never at the end, always in the middle – and we will remain always in the middle.\nGautam Buddha loved to say, “My path is the middle path, majjhim nikai” – there is no beginning, no end. We are always in the middle, growing eternally, flowering, blossoming, finding new spaces.\nYou are blessed, Nityananda, to have felt the change from being a disciple to becoming a disciple.\nBecoming is a higher stage.\nIn language it is not so, in existence it is so.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"5554","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_osho_upanishad/part24/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_osho_upanishad/>The Osho Upanishad</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">24 Around me\... something happens</h1><div class=post-meta>27 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;5554 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Osho_Upanishad/part24.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part23>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

WITH AN ANCIENT BELOVED, AS IF I HAD KNOWN YOU FOR A LONG TIME.</p><p><br></p><p>IS IT SO, OR IS EVERY MEETING WITH AN ENLIGHTENED BEING SO MUCH A
REMINDER OF ONE’S OWN INNER SELF THAT IT FEELS AS IF ONE HAS MET
BEFORE?</p><p><br></p><p>Purna, the experience of remembering as if you have been with me
before in the past lives has two dimensions – one, which you mention in
your question itself.</p><p><br></p><p>Each meeting with an enlightened person is meeting with a mirror. You
see yourself as in reality you are – not the mask but the original face,
not the personality but your universal being. The meeting with the
enlightened person creates a resonance, a certain vibration that reaches
to the very depths of your being. Because you don’t know your self, it
seems you have met this enlightened being before – because you don’t
know your own enlightenment. It is your self nature. This is one
dimension. But there is another dimension also. You have lived many
lives, and it is impossible that you have not come across the awakened,
the enlightened, the illuminated beings – perhaps many times.</p><p><br></p><p>You have met these strangers, these outsiders, on different paths, on
different crossroads – the quality of enlightenment is the same. So if
you loved me deeply enough, all those experiences –</p><p>which were momentary, because you never lived with an enlightened
being long enough; otherwise you would not be here – just passing
moments, but even the shadows, the reflections, are revived again
because the taste is the same.</p><p><br></p><p>Gautam Buddha is reported to have said, “You can taste the ocean from
anywhere. It is always salty.” It does not make any difference whether
it is the Atlantic or Pacific. So is the case with enlightenment: it is
an ocean of consciousness, and the taste is immensely sweet, fulfilling,
enlightening. And the person who is before you is no longer important.
What is important is the invisible experience that he is carrying within
himself.</p><p><br></p><p>So if you have passed a Gautam Buddha on a crossroad, or a Mahavira,
or a Mahakashyap, or a Kabir, or a Farid – meeting me, all those
momentary impressions on your being will be revived again and it will
appear as if you have known me before, many many times in many many
lives.</p><p><br></p><p>But the very apparent meaning is not true.</p><p><br></p><p>I was not enlightened before this life. So even if you have met me,
you have not met me – it was just an unconscious being like yourself.
And you have been meeting thousands of people. I may have been one of
those thousands of unconscious people that you came across – that is not
significant.</p><p><br></p><p>The difficulty with enlightenment is that you can be enlightened only
in one life, because that is your last life. Once you have become
enlightened, you cannot come again into the human body. You are released
from the prison, from the pain, from the anguish, from the meaningless,
miserable existence. You are no more confined in any form; you enter
into a formless universal consciousness. Once enlightened, your death is
going to be the last death. In other words, only enlightened people die.
The unenlightened ... very difficult – they go on coming back, they
never die. Only the enlightened person can afford death; the
unenlightened cannot afford it, he is not yet ready.</p><p><br></p><p>Life is a school, and unless you have learned the lesson you will
have to come back again and again to the same class. Once you have
learned the lesson, passed the examination, then even if you want to
come back into the class you will find all doors are closed for you. You
have to move higher, to a different level of being.</p><p><br></p><p>We have moved from one form to another form. Man is the last form.
Beyond man is a formless, oceanic consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>Gautam Buddha says, “I will be coming back after twenty-five
centuries.” He is simply giving a consolation. In his place I have come!
But the taste is the same. He has not lied – in a sense; in a sense he
has lied.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus says, “I will be coming back.” Krishna says, “I will be coming
back.” No enlightened person can come back.</p><p>Then why are these people saying these things? They know they cannot
come back. But people will be becoming enlightened – and enlightenment
has no name. Whether it is in the body of Gautam</p><p>Buddha or in the body of Krishna or in the body of Jesus or in the
body of anybody else, it is the same phenomenon. So apparently they are
lying, but fundamentally they are saying a very profound truth.</p><p><br></p><p>Purna, that’s what you experienced when you first met me.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, you have been meeting me before – in other enlightened people.
But if they can say that they will be coming ... and I have to come,
then I can say I was there ... just lying backwards. When you met Gautam
Buddha you met me. The experience, not the body; not the skeleton but
the consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>I was in Nagpur speaking in a Buddhist conference. I am not a
Buddhist ... only Buddhists were invited to speak; I was the only one
who was not a Buddhist. The president of the conference, Bhadant Anand
Kausalyayan, was a little puzzled. I was just sitting next to him. He
whispered in my ear, “Have you become a Buddhist?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I don’t need to be a Buddhist.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Then why are you here in a Buddhist conference?” I said,
“Because I am a buddha.”</p><p>He said, “My God. Then you should be presiding.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “That’s true. Come down. You are only a Buddhist. And I have
just come by the way after twenty-five centuries, to see how things are
going.”</p><p><br></p><p>But he could not absorb the shock of my saying that I am the buddha.
In the night he came to meet me in the house of a friend, where I was
staying. He was a common friend; he was his friend also. And he said, “I
had to come, because since the morning I have not been able to drop the
idea that a man can say with such authority that he is the buddha. I
have been a Buddhist for fifty years, and I don’t have the guts to say
that I am a buddha; I am still a Buddhist, trying to follow the
principles of Buddha. And you don’t seem to follow any principles at
all.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Those principles are for Buddhists. Buddhas make principles,
they don’t follow them. And I can say it with authority because Gautam
Buddha himself has said that he will be coming after twenty-five
centuries. Do you think he was lying?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “No, I cannot think that way.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you think he will come exactly in the same body? That body you
have burned. Do you think he will be born as a prince? – because now
there are no kings. Where are you going to find a beautiful woman like
Yashodhara for him to marry?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “My God, in all these details ... naturally they cannot be
repeated, because to repeat all those details means to bring that whole
century – the kingdoms, the people ... because a single man is not an
island, he is connected.”</p><p>Now Buddha was the son of a king, Shuddhodhana. I said, “First you
will have to find Shuddhodhana, and what about Shuddhodhana’s father? It
is going to be difficult. You will have to find Yashodhara. What about
Yashodhara’s father?</p><p><br></p><p>“You will have to manage a son to be born, and on the night the son
is born Buddha has to be exactly twenty-nine years old and he has to
escape in a golden chariot. Where are you going to find these things?
You can do it in a drama, but in reality ... Trust me, I am the buddha –
this time born to a different father, this time no Yashodhara, because
last time it was enough. One has to learn from experience. This time no
children, I cannot tolerate them; they are the nastiest people in the
world.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “My God. You have made the thing such that one wants to feel
that perhaps you are the Buddha.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “It is not a question of feeling. I don’t depend on your
feeling. I am the buddha, whether you feel it or not. There were many
fools like you in Buddha’s time who never accepted him as the buddha,
the enlightened, the awakened. It is up to you to be wise or to be a
fool.”</p><p><br></p><p>Purna, you must have come across me many times – not in this body,
but you must have come across the same experience. Sometimes a
Mohammedan, Farid; a weaver, Kabir; a shoemaker, Raidas. Sometimes a
prince, Gautam; sometimes a businessman, Tuladhar. Sometimes a man ...
sometimes a woman, like Rabiya al-Adabiya.</p><p><br></p><p>Enlightenment is simply realizing one’s universal self. Whoever
realizes it has the same taste – his eyes radiate the same light, his
gestures have the same grace, he has the same beauty.</p><p><br></p><p>If you are receptive, meeting one enlightened person, you have met
all the enlightened people who have happened in the whole history of
man; not only the past, but even those who will happen in the
future.</p><p><br></p><p>In the enlightened consciousness the past, the present, the future
are all dissolved into a single moment.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DEFEND YOU, AND EQUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO DESERT YOU.
I AM OVERWHELMINGLY AWARE OF HOW MUCH I OWE YOU AND HOW DEEPLY I LOVE
YOU.</p><p><br></p><p>It is certainly impossible to defend me – unless you become
enlightened. That is the only defense you can provide to the world.</p><p><br></p><p>No logical, no rational, no intellectual argumentation can defend me;
but you can become enlightened, which is far easier. Then you will be my
defense – the more souls are aflame, the more I am defended.</p><p><br></p><p>And you say, “It is also impossible to desert you.”</p><p>That too is possible through the same method, enlightenment – you
will be able to defend me and you will be able to desert me. Once you
are enlightened, I can say goodbye. There is no need to hang around me.
Before that, you cannot defend me and you cannot desert me.</p><p><br></p><p>And the remaining question is absolutely absurd. You say you owe me
so much – all bullshit. You owe nothing to me unless you are
enlightened. What do you owe to me? I just enjoy telling stories</p><p>... and you think you owe something to me? I just enjoy gossiping,
telling jokes, talking about things which cannot be talked about – just
an old habit. You don’t owe anything to me.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, you will owe something to me when you become enlightened – just
a thank you. That too need not be said. I will understand it.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 3</p><p><br></p><p>OH MY MASTER,</p><p><br></p><p>I KNOW NOTHING, BUT I KNOW ONE THING – THAT YOU LOVE ME. THANK YOU,
OSHO.</p><p><br></p><p>Jaya, you know that I love you, I know that you love me; and really
there is nothing else to say – either from your side or from my
side.</p><p><br></p><p>So we can take the next question. Question 4</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>OFTEN MY FELLOW SANNYASINS ASK WHAT I THINK ABOUT A PARTICULAR EVENT
THAT TOOK PLACE NEAR YOU, OR HOW I FEEL ABOUT THE ORGANIZATION AROUND
YOU.</p><p><br></p><p>BEING HERE WITH YOU, I FIND MYSELF MORE INTERESTED IN THAT EMPTINESS
WHICH YOU SPEAK AROUND, THAT SPACE FROM WHERE YOU COME.</p><p><br></p><p>OSHO, WILL YOU SPEAK TO MY FRIENDS ABOUT THE CRAZY EVENTS AND ACTIONS
THAT ALWAYS SURROUND YOUR PRESENCE?</p><p><br></p><p>There are many things to be said about the question.</p><p><br></p><p>First, there is no organization around me. I am against organizations
because each organization kills the truth.</p><p><br></p><p>The ancient story is that a little devil came running to the master
devil and said, “Master, what are you doing here wasting your time
smoking a cigar? There on the earth one man has found the truth. And if
the people of the earth come to know about the truth, that will be a
calamity to us. Hell will be deserted. There will not be a single
newcomer anymore. Something has to be done urgently!”</p><p><br></p><p>But the old devil went on smoking the Havana cigar. He said, “Calm
down, my son. You are new. I have made every arrangement.”</p><p>He said, “But I am coming exactly from the spot! There is no
arrangement!”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “You don’t understand. There are already organizers around
the man – priests, interpreters, organizers. A church is being made, and
they are standing between the man and the masses. Whatever he says, they
interpret it before it reaches to the people.</p><p><br></p><p>“This is my old strategy. Try it, and it always succeeds. That’s how
I have killed all the religions.”</p><p><br></p><p>Truth has been found many times, but it has never been possible to
make it available to the people. The organization becomes a wall – power
seekers, hierarchies, bureaucracies. And the man who has found the truth
– he is so alone in this crowd of scholars, priests, power seekers,
interpreters; he finds himself absolutely helpless. Whatever he says
they distort it. Whatever he says, something else reaches to the
people.</p><p><br></p><p>There are others who are writing books, and these books will be
worshipped, they will become holy books. Sculptors have arrived; they
are making the statue of the man who has found the truth. Nobody is
interested in the truth, everybody is interested in his own business.
They worship the man, and worshipping is another form of crucifying.</p><p><br></p><p>If you are cultured, you worship; if you are uncultured, you crucify
– but there is no difference between the two.</p><p><br></p><p>The worshippers say, “You are God incarnate. We will remember you
forever. Our children will worship you. There will be temples all over
the earth, your statues all over the world.”</p><p><br></p><p>The scribes are writing books, the writers are making great systems
of thought.</p><p><br></p><p>Nobody listens to the man. In fact, nobody is there to listen to him.
Everybody is there to exploit him.</p><p><br></p><p>The priest says, “Ask me. He is so far above that without mediators,
there is no possibility of any communication.”</p><p><br></p><p>Just recently the pope declared that anybody who confesses to God
directly, without the mediation of a Catholic priest, is committing a
grave sin. Strange – you cannot confess to God directly, it is a grave
sin. First you have to go to the Catholic priest. Everything should move
through proper channels; you have to tell the Catholic priest, and he
will inform God, and God will inform him what punishment has to be given
to you.</p><p><br></p><p>The old devil said, “You don’t be worried. I have my popes, Ayatolla
Khomeiniacs, shankaracharyas, Acharya Tulsi’s – and all kinds of idiots
are there. We need not be worried; just take a Havana cigar, relax. You
are just new and don’t understand the business yet.”</p><p><br></p><p>So the first thing: I don’t have any organization. I don’t have any
holy book. I don’t have any mediator. I don’t have any interpreter.
Whatever you see as organization is not organization, it is simply
functional; it is just like the post office.</p><p>Now so many millions of people writing letters to each other ... some
kind of arrangement has to be there; somebody has to sort out the
letters, where they have to go. But the postmaster has not any
authority, nor the postman, nor the postmaster general. Who knows the
name of the postmaster general? It is just functional work.</p><p><br></p><p>In a good world, you will not know the name of the president of your
country – it is a functional post. You will not know who is the prime
minister – there is no need, it is simply functional. They should be
doing their work, and they are needed just the way shoemakers are need,
scavengers are needed. The president is not needed more than the
plumber; in fact, the plumber is needed more than the president. The
president is simply sitting there in the capital doing nothing, and when
something goes wrong in your bathroom – which happens almost every day –
then the plumber is needed. But nobody honors the plumber; the plumber
has no authority, he has no power. And bogus people who are not doing
anything have power.</p><p><br></p><p>That is the miracle of organization: Organization creates useless
people, but makes everybody feel that without them the whole society
will collapse.</p><p><br></p><p>Stalin never took a single holiday in his whole life, and he was one
of the men who ruled longest. And when his daughter, Svetlana once asked
him ... He must have been in a very good mood, which was rare. Svetlana
was married to an Indian. She has told the story to me herself.</p><p><br></p><p>Stalin said that he cannot take any holiday because the holiday will
make the whole country feel that the country can go perfectly well
without him. And the truth is, the country will go perfectly well
without him. He has to remain in the chair to make the country feel that
without him, everything is going to collapse.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole bureaucracy makes you feel that without them everything is
going to be wrong. This is their way of gaining power. And the people
who are interested in power are the people who are the most empty, who
are suffering from an inferiority complex. These are the most sick
people in the world.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t have any organization. Just functionally, if only a hundred
people can sit here and three hundred people come, then somebody has to
prevent the two hundred, give them passes – “You come tomorrow.” But
that does not make him powerful, so that you have to have his picture
hanging in your house – “This man is no ordinary man; this man passes
out tickets, worship him.” He is simply serving you, there is no
question of power.</p><p><br></p><p>Secondly, you are not asking your question. You are asking questions
that your friends ask you.</p><p><br></p><p>This is dishonest. You are allowed to ask your question. And I know
it is your question, but you don’t have the courage to say that “This is
my question.”</p><p><br></p><p>I used to live with a man for three years. He was an astrologer and a
palmist. And it was an everyday experience that people will bring their
own birth chart and will say, “This is my friend’s birth chart” –
because if the man says something ugly nobody wants to hear it. If
things are good it is good, if things are bad it is about the friend.
But that man was very clever. He would say, “Good. Leave this chart
here, and tomorrow bring your friend with you.” Now, it was a difficulty
– where to find a friend? And who is going to be with him, to be
unnecessarily in trouble?</p><p>I said, “Why do you do that?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “This is an everyday thing. They come about other people,
and these are their problems. But a person who has not the courage to
say honestly that ‘This is my problem’ will not be able to solve
it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Your friends ask you about the organization.” It is not true. It is
your own question. There is no problem; why can’t you say, “I have a
question about your organization”?</p><p><br></p><p>“Friends ask about things that happen around You.” Strange. Why don’t
those friends come themselves? All those friends have sent one
representative.</p><p><br></p><p>Things happen.</p><p><br></p><p>Wherever there is silence, a certain magic prevails.</p><p><br></p><p>The more profound the silence, the deeper is the magic.</p><p><br></p><p>I have seen people changing so dramatically, so unbelievably – one
could never have thought before that this man can become so peaceful, so
loving; that so many flowers can grow in his consciousness, so that he
becomes almost fragrant; that his life becomes a song, a dance, a
celebration.</p><p><br></p><p>It is simply a question of resonance. Great musicians know it. A
great musician can play on his sitar, and can keep another sitar in an
empty room far away in another corner. And there comes a moment when he
is really lost in playing his sitar that the other sitar – which is
simply sitting there, nobody is playing it – starts resonating the same
tune, vibrating.</p><p><br></p><p>In the old days that was one of the most important things before a
man was called a master musician – if he could create resonance, only
then was he a master; otherwise he was just an ordinary musician.</p><p><br></p><p>There are stories which look fictitious, but they are not – because
now we know something scientifically, that they are possible.</p><p><br></p><p>The Indian classical music has different ragas for different
purposes. There are ragas which can create light, fire; just an unlit
lamp suddenly becomes aflame. A certain resonance, a certain hit of the
vibrations creates the fire, and the flame comes up.</p><p><br></p><p>Now – scientists say, and it has been followed by military experts –
whenever soldiers pass on a bridge, their ordinary musical walk is
broken. They are ordered not to walk the way they have been trained –
thousands of people raising their left legs at the same time, creating
the same sound. Because it was found in the first world war that many
bridges were broken – and those bridges were able to carry bigger loads;
just an army passing ... what happened? Just a certain rhythm of their
legs falling on the bridge, and the bridge was gone, and the people were
falling from the bridge.</p><p><br></p><p>First it was thought to be just an accident, but when it started
happening on many bridges then things were looked into. It was found
that it is the sound of their musical march that gives a nervous
breakdown to the poor bridge.</p><p>You say, “Crazy things happen around You.” That, too, is said by your
friends. I have never seen any crazy thing happening around here. Yes, I
have seen crazy people becoming sane; but in a crazy world to be sane
looks like being crazy. Just go to a madhouse ...</p><p><br></p><p>It happened to a friend’s father. He is a special kind of insane
person: for six months he is insane, and six months he is absolutely
sane; periodically his pendulum moves. While he is sane he is always
sick – this infection, that infection, and he is always going to the
hospital, to the doctor, and the whole family is troubled. And when the
six months pass and he becomes mad, he becomes healthy; in those six
months, no infection, no illness. His weight goes higher, he looks
radiant.</p><p><br></p><p>At four o’clock in the morning he wakes up the whole village, “Come
on to the river!” He drags people out of their houses; “It is time! Go
to the river.” Those six months when he is mad, he keeps the whole
village taking a bath at least two times a day – morning and evening. He
purchases so many fruits – because he has not to pay, his sons have to
pay – and distributes them to everybody. Vegetables, fruits, sweets ...
the whole town is happy when he is mad. Only his family is sick, ill –
because he goes on taking money from the shop; even the small children
of the house guard the shop and shout, “Mommy, father is taking
money!”</p><p><br></p><p>And he will say, “Shut up! Am I your father, or are you my father?
This is my shop.” All that money goes in distributing sweets and fruits
and things to anybody, whoever meets him on the way. But he is so happy,
and the whole village is so happy. He disappears sometimes in those six
months – just by chance he reaches the station, and if the train is
there he will sit on it. Once he disappeared. Much searching was done,
and he was not found – where he had gone, which train he had caught
nobody knew.</p><p><br></p><p>And all the ticket collectors and ticket checkers, all know him, so
nobody bothers to ask for the ticket. He reached Agra – it is so far
away from my village – he was feeling hungry.</p><p>He went to a shop. There is an Indian food, it is called khaja – it
also means “eat it.”</p><p><br></p><p>So he asked what it was, and the shopkeeper said, “Khaja.” He said,
“Okay,” and he started eating it. The shopkeeper said, “What are you
doing?” He said, “Exactly what you said.” And he was so robust ... And
the shopkeeper said, “This is strange.</p><p><br></p><p>You ask the name, and you finish the whole thing! You will have to
come to the court.” A crowd gathered ... He said, “Listen, I am a
stranger. I simply asked this fool what it is; he said khaja. I have
eaten it, according to him. I am ready to go to any police station, to
any court; such a name should not be given to a sweet.” In the court
they found that he was out of his mind. They jailed him. He was sent to
Lahore – because in those days Pakistan was not divided; now Lahore is
in Pakistan. Lahore had the greatest madhouse of those days. After
three, four months, his time was over. He was periodically mad and
periodically sane; he became sane. He went to the superintendent and he
said, “This is the situation: I go mad for six months, and for six
months I am sane. Now my madness is gone. Now I remember it was not
right to eat that thing; it is the name of the thing, he was not meaning
that I had to eat it. But I was mad; now I am perfectly sane. And now
there is great trouble” – because there were at least one thousand mad
people in that madhouse. And he said, “When I was mad there was no
problem – somebody was pulling my leg, somebody was sitting on my
head;</p><p>it was all okay. For mad people nothing is wrong, everything is
right. But now that I am sane, it is very difficult to live with these
one thousand mad people. Somebody comes and starts pulling my nose – and
I am not doing anything to anybody! Somebody is sitting on my head ...
and whatsoever they want to do they do. Somebody is taking my shirt, and
I have to fight, and you cannot fight because they are all mad. And my
trouble is that when I am mad I have energy, and when I am not mad I am
a very sick person. Please release me.</p><p><br></p><p>But the superintendent said, “We cannot do anything against the
court. You have to be here for six months.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “You don’t understand. When I was mad, it was okay; but now
I am not mad. I am the only person here who is not mad. You just live
one day inside the madhouse and you will understand my situation.” But
nobody would listen to him. He was telling me, “In those two months of
sanity in the insane house I suffered hell. But for four months when I
was mad, it was heaven; it was such a joy to be with all those mad
people, such a synchronicity – everything was right, nothing was wrong.
But for those two months everything was wrong, nothing was right, and I
was the only sufferer.”</p><p><br></p><p>Here, nobody goes crazy. My people are the sanest people in the
world.</p><p><br></p><p>But the world is crazy, and my people are few. And the world is big –
they have the majority, they have the politicians, they have the
governments, they have the churches.</p><p><br></p><p>They have everything in their hands, and they are not even alert that
they are insane. To be in the mind is to be insane; mind is the place of
insanity.</p><p><br></p><p>Only those people are really sane who have transcended the mind, who
have gone beyond it into silence where no thoughts, no desires, no
emotions, nothing exists. Only in that peace is your real health. And
that kind of sanity happens here.</p><p><br></p><p>So tell your fictitious friends that people are going sane; and if
they want to be sane, bring them here. But before you bring them, at
least you should go sane.</p><p><br></p><p>Mind is crazy.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the difference between the ordinary psychology and the
psychology I teach: the ordinary psychology says that mind can be sane
or insane; and I say mind can only be normally insane or abnormally
insane, but mind can never be sane.</p><p><br></p><p>Sanity is always above mind, beyond mind. And only very few people in
the world have been blessed enough to be sane. But the mad crowd has
treated them really badly ... poisoning Socrates, who is one of the
sanest men possible. But it is the insane people who decide whether to
poison him or not. Al-Hillaj Mansoor was killed by the insane people.
Sarmad, one of the sanest men, was beheaded in New Delhi. The insane
crowd was immensely happy to get rid of these sane people. Where
everybody is sad, don’t rejoice; where everybody is miserable, don’t
look blissful; where everybody is living in hell, don’t show your heart
and the heaven that you have found there – otherwise you will be
punished for it. It is a strange world. Here, those who are sane,
blissful, blessed, are punished; those who are miserable, mad, are
rewarded.</p><p>Question 5</p><p><br></p><p>BELOVED OSHO, IN POONA WHEN I FIRST TOOK SANNYAS, I FELT VERY YOUNG
AND INNOCENT. I HAD A “YES” FOR EVERYTHING, AND WANTED TO LEARN TO BE A
“GOOD” SANNYASIN. WATCHING OTHERS, I WAS LEARNING WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE TO
BE A DISCIPLE.</p><p><br></p><p>IN RAJNEESHPURAM, I FELT THAT AS LONG AS I WAS LOVING YOU, WHATEVER I
DID THAT FELT APPROPRIATE WAS FINE – THINKING THAT I WAS A DISCIPLE, AND
THE IMPORTANT THING WAS TO COME FROM THAT SPACE. OSHO, NOW IT FEELS LIKE
THERE IS NO “BEING” YOUR DISCIPLE; THERE IS ONLY A NEVER-ENDING PROCESS
OF BECOMING. IT LOOKS AS THOUGH THERE IS NO SITTING BACK, HAVING ALREADY
BECOME “OSHO’S SANNYASIN”; THERE IS NOTHING BUT TAKING EACH STEP ONE
AFTER ANOTHER, WALKING THIS PATH, THIS ENDLESS PATH.</p><p><br></p><p>WILL YOU PLEASE SPEAK ON THESE CHANGES AND ON THIS JOURNEY WITH
YOU?</p><p><br></p><p>Nityananda, you have described very accurately each step a disciple
has to go through. This is the most important conclusion: that there is
no question of just being a disciple, it is always becoming. You cannot
come to a full stop; the journey is endless, and this is the beauty of
the journey.</p><p><br></p><p>From being to becoming is a tremendous quantum leap. If you look
around in life, you will never find being anywhere; you will always find
becoming.</p><p><br></p><p>The fallacy of being is created by language, it is the poverty of
language. You see a roseflower ... you see it and you say, “What a
beautiful flower.” But the flower is continuously flowering, it is never
in a state of stopping anywhere.The tree is continuously growing; the
word ‘tree’ is not right. In existence there are no nouns, there are
only verbs. It will be very difficult to make a language only with
verbs, but the truth is, existence has no nouns.</p><p><br></p><p>A tree is in fact treeing, a river in fact is rivering. You are each
moment growing – either growing old, the ordinary way of the world; or
growing up, the way of my people. Growing old, you have not to do
anything – you will grow old, biology will take care of it.</p><p><br></p><p>Growing up means a conscious alertness – so that the body goes on
growing old, but your consciousness goes on growing upwards, growing up.
But it is always growing; even in death a conscious being is
growing.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole existence is a great verb, not a noun – not a stone, but a
flower. And there is no end anywhere because there has never been any
beginning. The very idea of beginning and end is just our mind
projection. Otherwise, we are always in the middle – never at the
beginning, never at the end, always in the middle – and we will remain
always in the middle.</p><p><br></p><p>Gautam Buddha loved to say, “My path is the middle path, majjhim
nikai” – there is no beginning, no end. We are always in the middle,
growing eternally, flowering, blossoming, finding new spaces.</p><p><br></p><p>You are blessed, Nityananda, to have felt the change from being a
disciple to becoming a disciple.</p><p>Becoming is a higher stage.</p><p><br></p><p>In language it is not so, in existence it is so.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part23>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

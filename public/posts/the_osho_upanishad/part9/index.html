Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
WHAT ARE THE ROOTS AND WHAT ARE THE WINGS OF A MEDITATOR?
Meditation is a way of settling in oneself, at the innermost core of your being. Once you have found the center of your existence, you will have found both the roots and the wings.
The roots are in existence, making you a more integrated human being, an individual."><meta name=author content="Osho"><link rel=canonical href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_osho_upanishad/part9/><meta name=google-site-verification content="XYZabc"><meta name=yandex-verification content="XYZabc"><meta name=msvalidate.01 content="XYZabc"><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.b609c58d5c11bb90b1a54e04005d74ad1ddf22165eb79f5533967e57df9c3b50.css integrity="sha256-tgnFjVwRu5CxpU4EAF10rR3fIhZet59VM5Z+V9+cO1A=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=mask-icon href=https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_osho_upanishad/part9/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:title" content="9 The way of the Upanishads"><meta property="og:description" content="< Previous | Contents | Next >

Once you have found the center of your existence, you will have found both the roots and the wings.\nThe roots are in existence, making you a more integrated human being, an individual. And the wings are in the fragrance that is released by being in contact with existence. The fragrance consists of freedom, love, compassion, authenticity, sincerity, a sense of humor, and a tremendous feeling of blissfulness.\nThe roots make you an individual, and the wings give you the freedom to love, to be creative, to share unconditionally the joy that you have found.\nThe roots and wings come together.\nThey are two sides of one experience, and that experience is finding the center of your being.\nWe are continuously moving on the circumference, always somewhere else far away from our own being, always directed towards others. When all this is dropped, when all objects are dropped, when\nyou close your eyes to all that is not you – even your mind, your heartbeats are left far behind – only a silence remains.\nIn this silence you will settle slowly into the center of your being, and then the roots will grow on their own accord, and the wings too. You need not worry about them. You cannot do anything about them. They come on their own.\nYou simply fulfill one condition: that is, to be at home – and the whole existence becomes a bliss to you, a benediction.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nWHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ANCIENT UPANISHAD AND THE ONE WHICH IS HAPPENING HERE AND NOW?\nThere is no difference. There cannot be, because it is not a question of time.\nIt may have happened thousands of years before, it may happen thousands of years in the future. The time is irrelevant; the question is of the happening.\nCan you ask the same question, “What is the difference between the ancient lovers and the modern lovers?” Love knows no time. Whether the love was in ancient times or today or in the future, time is simply not relevant. Love is the same.\nAn upanishad is a love affair – a love affair between a master and a disciple, a love affair where the master is ready to share. He is just like a raincloud, ready to shower. And the disciple is ready to receive – open, with no windows closed, holding nothing back – totally available. Whenever a disciple is totally available and the master is overflowing with his ecstasy, the upanishad happens.\nThere is no difference in the ancient upanishad, in this upanishad, or in the future upanishads. An upanishad is a phenomenon which is beyond time, beyond space. Don’t call upanishads ‘ancient’ because that word ‘ancient’ makes them related to time. Don’t call this upanishad ‘modern’ because time has no place as far as the phenomenon of upanishad is concerned. There is no ancient love, there is no modern love.\nAnd neither is it confined to space: it can happen anywhere, any time; the only necessity is that somebody is overflowing with blissfulness and somebody else has the guts to be available to this overflowing bliss, is not afraid.\nPeople are always afraid of unknown things, and this is the most unknown.\nPeople are always afraid of the strange, and this is the strangest experience possible.\nPeople are always afraid of the mysterious, and this is the last word in the world of mysteries. Question 3\nBELOVED OSHO,\nARE THE UPANISHADS AND ZEN THE SAME?\nThey are not.\nThe upanishad is a happening between the master and the disciple, Zen is the happening in the disciple himself. The master may help him, may create devices, show the path – but Zen is basically an individual experience. It is not like love. It happens in your aloneness. It is not a relationship.\nUpanishad is the greatest relationship. It cannot happen if the master is alone. He may be full, overflowing; but it cannot happen because the receiving end is absent. It cannot happen if the disciple is alone, however open, however available – but available to what? Open to what?\nUpanishad is a more human phenomenon than Zen. It is closer to human reality because it is closer to love. It can be understood more easily, because it is very difficult to find a person who has not tasted something of love in some moments. There is some experience which can be used to explain to him what happens when a master and a disciple dissolve into each other.\nSo the first thing: the upanishad is a totally different phenomenon than Zen.\nAnd the second thing: the experience is the same. The paths are different, but finally – whether you have followed Zen and reached alone to the peak, or you have allowed a master to hold your hand in deep trust and reached the peak – it does not matter how you reach the peak. Your vehicles can be different, your means can be different; the peak is the same. The experience of finding oneself and simultaneously finding the whole secret of existence is the same.\nSo on the one hand I say they are totally different. On the other hand, I say they are exactly the same.\nAnd there is no contradiction in these two statements. The paths are different but the ultimate finding is the same.\nZen is an arduous path, a hard and long way. But it is up to you – there are people who love to go the hard way. The simple way does not appeal to them; the hard way is exciting.\nUpanishad is not a hard way. It is a very simple and relaxed experience. It is the shortest way possible to the ultimate reality.\nBut there are different kinds of people in the world; they all need different paths to reach to their fulfillment. These are the two extremes. In this sense, Zen and upanishad are as far away from each other as two points can be; and yet, the final conclusion is always the same. One is a hard way, a long way, but a few people need it.\nOne mystic in Sri Lanka was dying. He declared that the next morning he would be dying. He had thousands of followers; they all gathered. He was old, almost ninety years, and he had been\nteaching these people for sixty years. And the Buddhist teaching is a very hard way. But the mystic, at the point of death said, “I have been teaching you the way I have followed, the way that has helped me to attain to the ultimate. But I now know that there is a shortcut in reaching to the ultimate too – so short that if somebody wants to go with me, stand up! I am leaving.”\nPeople looked at each other, at those about whom they thought, “These are very religious people, perhaps they may stand up. As far as I am concerned there are so many problems.”\nNobody stood up. Only one man raised his hand.\nThe old man said, “Even that is a great consolation to me. But why are you not standing up?”\nHe said, “Because I don’t want to go right now, but I want to know here the shortcut is in case at some time I want to go. Why bother with the hard and long way? That’s why I just raised my hand. I cannot stand up. As far as the hard way is concerned, we know – because for sixty years you have been teaching it. And at the last moment.You are a strange fellow. At least tell us where the short\nway is!”\nThe mystic said, “The short way has a condition: it is only for those who are ready to go right now. I give another chance – stand up!”\nEven that man’s hand went down, and there was utter silence. And everybody was looking at each other.…\nThe old man died.\nPeople want the way to be hard and to be long because this is a good excuse for avoiding – because the way is so long and so hard.life is so short and so many problems, so many responsibilities;\nso much has to be done. The children are growing up, they have to be married, the business is not good – or the business is so good that this is not the moment to meditate.\nUpanishad is the shortest possible way. Neither has the disciple to do anything nor has the master to do anything. Doing is not part of it.\nI have quoted the great Zen poet Basho many times to you: “Sitting silently, doing nothing, the spring comes and the grass grows by itself.” As far as upanishadic methodology is concerned, even doing nothing is not needed. And what are you going to do even if the grass grows by itself? Whether you sit silently or not, it will grow. Whether you sit silently or not, the spring will come. You are unnecessarily taking the credit for the grass growing by itself – because you have been sitting silently, doing nothing! Even when you were not, the grass used to grow; when you will not be here the grass will continue to grow. It has nothing to do with you.\nThe upanishad does not even ask you to sit silently doing nothing. Even doing nothing is a doing.\nThe whole approach of the upanishad is so totally different.the disciple is available, the master is\noverflowing, and something transpires. Nobody is doing it. Nobody can take the credit for it; hence,\nI say the way of the upanishad is the most mysterious way in the whole human consciousness and its evolution.\nZen is mysterious, but yet it can be understood.\nUpanishad is simply mysterious, there is no way of understanding it. You can have it, you can dissolve into it, but there is no question of explanation – only experience.\nAll over the world there have been mystery schools. In Greece, Pythagoras founded mystery schools. In the religion of the Jews, Baal Shem founded a mystery school called Hassidism. In China there is the mystery school of tao, and when Buddhism reached China a new mystery school, a chain of new mystery schools opened, ch’an. The same mystery school, ch’an, reached Japan with the name ‘zen.’ But the word ‘zen’ or ‘ch’an’, or the Buddhist word ‘jhan’ are all different forms of the Sanskrit word ‘dhyan’.\nIn India dhyan has been known for centuries – before Gautam Buddha ever meditated, that mystery school was there.\nThere was the mystery school of tantra. There were the mystery schools of different types of yoga.\nI have gone through all these schools not as a scholar – that is not my approach – but as an experiencer. I can say to you: nothing rises higher than the mystery school of upanishads – because it is the shortest. Nobody is expected to do anything, and yet the miracle happens.\nQuestion 4 BELOVED OSHO,\nWHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RELIGIOUS SCRIPTURES LIKE THE GITA, THE KORAN, THE BIBLE, ETC. AND THE UPANISHADS?\nFirst, THE UPANISHADS are not religious scriptures. They are poetic expressions of those who have known.\nThey are not Hindu, they are not Buddhist, they are not Jaina; they don’t belong to any religion. They are the experiences of individuals sitting at the feet of their master – and when the experience overwhelmed them they danced, they sang, they uttered strange statements. And these were not made by their minds; it was almost as if they were just hollow bamboos. Existence has made them flutes; it was existence itself singing a song.\nThat’s why no upanishad carries the name of its writer.\nThe KORAN belongs to Mohammed, the NEW TESTAMENT belongs to Jesus Christ, the GITA belongs to Krishna, the DHAMMAPADA belongs to Gautam Buddha; ISAVASYA UPANISHAD belongs to no one.\nTremendously courageous people... they have not even signed their names. In fact, it would have been ugly to sign because they were not the writers, they were not the composers, they were not the poets. The poetry was coming from above, from beyond. They were simply vehicles.\nBecause of this... you will be surprised also to know that the whole KORAN consists of Hazrat Mohammed’s statements, the GITA consists totally of Krishna’s statements, but each upanishad consists of many peoples’ expressions – anybody who had reached to that beyond and allowed the beyond to descend through him.\nTHE UPANISHADS have not bothered to collect the words of one person. Each upanishad contains the words of many enlightened people, and without any signatures. Words have never been so golden. Words have never taken such high flights, and yet the people who allowed them to happen have remained anonymous. This is so beautiful, immensely beautiful, because they knew that, “We have nothing to do. We have just been passages. Something has come through us.”\nOne upanishadic rishi, one upanishadic seer – the name, of course, is unknown – is reported to have said, “If there is any mistake in my statement, that is mine. And if there is any truth, I cannot claim that it is mine. The truth belongs to the universe; the mistake belongs to me, I was not such a good vehicle.” These were rare people, unique human beings, the very salt of the earth.\nI would like my sannyasins to become this very salt of the earth again.\nIt is because these are not religious scriptures, that’s why there is no religion following THE UPANISHADS. These are the very few books which contain the greatest quantity of truth and have remained unorganized. There is no organization around them; there cannot be. Because of the very methodology there cannot be a church, there cannot be a pope or a shankaracharya.\nI love someone, but I cannot make an organization of it. And when I leave this body I will leave in heritage my wealth, my house, my land, everything – but I cannot leave my love in heritage.\nThese UPANISHADS are pure love, so there have been no successors, no priests, no followers. These books are the most pure in the whole world, absolutely without any pollution. They have remained just the way they were expressed.\nNobody has fought because of THE UPANISHADS.\nMohammedans have fought because of the KORAN. Hindus have fought because of the GITA. Christians have fought because of the NEW TESTAMENT. Everybody has been fighting for their religious scripture.\nWho cares about the poor UPANISHADS? But it has been fortunate that nobody has bothered about them; they have remained as pure as when they were given birth to, as innocent as ever.\nThe statements in THE UPANISHADS – there are one hundred and twelve upanishads; the statements in THE UPANISHADS cannot be made into dogmas for the simple reason that the statements are not rational, logical. They are contradictory.\nOne upanishad says, “I do not know who created the world.” You cannot make a religion on such a statement: I do not know who created the world. Then what do you know? – because that is going to be the basis of any religion: the belief in God, the belief in creation. But like an innocent child, the upanishadic seer says, “I do not know who created the world.” And this is closer to truth: nobody\nknows who created the world. Nobody knows whether anybody ever created it – it may have been always there. And it seems most scientific that it has always been there and it will remain always there.\nThe whole idea of creation is stupid. But if you drop the idea of creation you have to drop the idea of a creator god. Then you have to drop the idea of the priest and the pope and the prophets and the messiah and the saviors and the reincarnations of God. There is no God. Then from where are reincarnations happening?\nI have heard.… A crazy man had applied to be given a job on a ship. He was interviewed. The captain and the high officials of the ship asked him, “If the ocean is in a turmoil and there is danger to the ship, what are you going to do?”\nHe said, “Simple...”.\nWhenever a situation like that happens, they drop heavy loads by the side of the ship, to keep the ship anchored. Those heavy loads are called anchors.\nSo the man said, “No problem. I will just drop a big anchor.”\nThe captain said, “But if another great turmoil comes – because these things happen in a chain, a great wave – what you are going to do?”\nHe said, “The same – another anchor. And if the third one comes, another anchor, and the fourth one comes, another anchor.”\nThe captain said, “Stop! First tell me, from where are you getting these anchors?”\nThe man said, “You are just as crazy as I am. From where are you getting all these turmoils? From the same place, I go on getting the anchors.”\nOne fallacy, one false statement, one fictitious idea gives birth to another fictitious idea.\nFirst you ask who created the world; immediately God comes in – one anchor. But somebody is bound to ask, “Who created God?” – another anchor; a bigger god created this smaller god. But the questions cannot stop. You have started a fictitious thing; now there is no way to stop. You will have to go on creating bigger gods, and the person will have to go on getting bigger anchors.\nTHE UPANISHADS are not religious scriptures. They don’t give you any belief system. They don’t tell you to believe in anything. They don’t have any god, they don’t have any creation. All that they have is a deep harmony between the master and the disciple. And that harmony brings such peace, such serenity, such tranquility, that all questions disappear – not that you found an answer, no. Just all questions disappear. The question of finding an answer does not arise; you don’t have any question, how can you have an answer?\nSo THE UPANISHADS don’t have any answer for anybody.\nThat’s why people have not taken much note of them, because they don’t have any answer for you. You have questions, you want answers.\nTHE UPANISHADS don’t have any answers. They are ready to take you into a different dimension of existence, to transmute you. It is a change of consciousness. And suddenly all doubts, all questions, everything disappears and what is left behind is just a beautiful peace.\nHence, every upanishad ends with om shanti, shanti, shanti. That word shanti means absolute silence. Beyond that silence there is nothing, and there is no need. It brings total contentment, absolute blissfulness, ultimate ecstasy.\nTHE UPANISHADS are the only free, absolutely free books as far as religious books are concerned. All religious books are imprisoned – Hindus have their prisons, Mohammedans have theirs, Christians have theirs. Nobody has dared to imprison THE UPANISHADS for the simple reason that those UPANISHADS are of no use as far as the priesthood is concerned, creating organization is concerned, exploiting people is concerned, giving false beliefs is concerned. Those UPANISHADS are dangerous; it is better to keep them aside.\nThe moment a book becomes a holy scripture it becomes poisoned. Then it is nothing but a strategy to make more and more slaves.\nTHE UPANISHADS cannot be condemned for doing any ugly thing to humanity. They have given their fragrance, they have blossomed, they have shared their joy – and with such beauty, such clarity – and without any loopholes, so that it is impossible to make them religious scriptures. They are truly religious. They are not scriptures, they are truly spiritual.\nIn the whole of history there are only a very few books which have remained uncontaminated by the cunningness of human mind. THE UPANISHADS are those few books.\nQuestion 5 BELOVED OSHO,\nWHAT IS YOUR BUSINESS?\nMy business is to keep many people in business!\nAll the religions have been teaching people to renounce the world. My business is to help people not to renounce the world. Be in business!\nAll the religions, without exception, are against life. My business is to destroy the conditionings that have been forced upon you against life; to give you a joy in life, to make you love life, sing, dance – because life is a celebration.\nMy business is to create this whole existence into a celebration.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"3488","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_osho_upanishad/part9/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_osho_upanishad/>The Osho Upanishad</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">9 The way of the Upanishads</h1><div class=post-meta>17 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;3488 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Osho_Upanishad/part9.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part8>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

heartbeats are left far behind – only a silence remains.</p><p><br></p><p>In this silence you will settle slowly into the center of your being,
and then the roots will grow on their own accord, and the wings too. You
need not worry about them. You cannot do anything about them. They come
on their own.</p><p><br></p><p>You simply fulfill one condition: that is, to be at home – and the
whole existence becomes a bliss to you, a benediction.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ANCIENT UPANISHAD AND THE ONE
WHICH IS HAPPENING HERE AND NOW?</p><p><br></p><p>There is no difference. There cannot be, because it is not a question
of time.</p><p><br></p><p>It may have happened thousands of years before, it may happen
thousands of years in the future. The time is irrelevant; the question
is of the happening.</p><p><br></p><p>Can you ask the same question, “What is the difference between the
ancient lovers and the modern lovers?” Love knows no time. Whether the
love was in ancient times or today or in the future, time is simply not
relevant. Love is the same.</p><p><br></p><p>An upanishad is a love affair – a love affair between a master and a
disciple, a love affair where the master is ready to share. He is just
like a raincloud, ready to shower. And the disciple is ready to receive
– open, with no windows closed, holding nothing back – totally
available. Whenever a disciple is totally available and the master is
overflowing with his ecstasy, the upanishad happens.</p><p><br></p><p>There is no difference in the ancient upanishad, in this upanishad,
or in the future upanishads. An upanishad is a phenomenon which is
beyond time, beyond space. Don’t call upanishads ‘ancient’ because that
word ‘ancient’ makes them related to time. Don’t call this upanishad
‘modern’ because time has no place as far as the phenomenon of upanishad
is concerned. There is no ancient love, there is no modern love.</p><p><br></p><p>And neither is it confined to space: it can happen anywhere, any
time; the only necessity is that somebody is overflowing with
blissfulness and somebody else has the guts to be available to this
overflowing bliss, is not afraid.</p><p><br></p><p>People are always afraid of unknown things, and this is the most
unknown.</p><p><br></p><p>People are always afraid of the strange, and this is the strangest
experience possible.</p><p>People are always afraid of the mysterious, and this is the last word
in the world of mysteries. Question 3</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>ARE THE UPANISHADS AND ZEN THE SAME?</p><p><br></p><p>They are not.</p><p><br></p><p>The upanishad is a happening between the master and the disciple, Zen
is the happening in the disciple himself. The master may help him, may
create devices, show the path – but Zen is basically an individual
experience. It is not like love. It happens in your aloneness. It is not
a relationship.</p><p><br></p><p>Upanishad is the greatest relationship. It cannot happen if the
master is alone. He may be full, overflowing; but it cannot happen
because the receiving end is absent. It cannot happen if the disciple is
alone, however open, however available – but available to what? Open to
what?</p><p><br></p><p>Upanishad is a more human phenomenon than Zen. It is closer to human
reality because it is closer to love. It can be understood more easily,
because it is very difficult to find a person who has not tasted
something of love in some moments. There is some experience which can be
used to explain to him what happens when a master and a disciple
dissolve into each other.</p><p><br></p><p>So the first thing: the upanishad is a totally different phenomenon
than Zen.</p><p><br></p><p>And the second thing: the experience is the same. The paths are
different, but finally – whether you have followed Zen and reached alone
to the peak, or you have allowed a master to hold your hand in deep
trust and reached the peak – it does not matter how you reach the peak.
Your vehicles can be different, your means can be different; the peak is
the same. The experience of finding oneself and simultaneously finding
the whole secret of existence is the same.</p><p><br></p><p>So on the one hand I say they are totally different. On the other
hand, I say they are exactly the same.</p><p>And there is no contradiction in these two statements. The paths are
different but the ultimate finding is the same.</p><p><br></p><p>Zen is an arduous path, a hard and long way. But it is up to you –
there are people who love to go the hard way. The simple way does not
appeal to them; the hard way is exciting.</p><p><br></p><p>Upanishad is not a hard way. It is a very simple and relaxed
experience. It is the shortest way possible to the ultimate reality.</p><p><br></p><p>But there are different kinds of people in the world; they all need
different paths to reach to their fulfillment. These are the two
extremes. In this sense, Zen and upanishad are as far away from each
other as two points can be; and yet, the final conclusion is always the
same. One is a hard way, a long way, but a few people need it.</p><p><br></p><p>One mystic in Sri Lanka was dying. He declared that the next morning
he would be dying. He had thousands of followers; they all gathered. He
was old, almost ninety years, and he had been</p><p>teaching these people for sixty years. And the Buddhist teaching is a
very hard way. But the mystic, at the point of death said, “I have been
teaching you the way I have followed, the way that has helped me to
attain to the ultimate. But I now know that there is a shortcut in
reaching to the ultimate too – so short that if somebody wants to go
with me, stand up! I am leaving.”</p><p><br></p><p>People looked at each other, at those about whom they thought, “These
are very religious people, perhaps they may stand up. As far as I am
concerned there are so many problems.”</p><p><br></p><p>Nobody stood up. Only one man raised his hand.</p><p><br></p><p>The old man said, “Even that is a great consolation to me. But why
are you not standing up?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Because I don’t want to go right now, but I want to know
here the shortcut is in case at some time I want to go. Why bother with
the hard and long way? That’s why I just raised my hand. I cannot stand
up. As far as the hard way is concerned, we know – because for sixty
years you have been teaching it. And at the last moment.<span class=s4></span>You are a strange fellow. At least tell us where the
short</p><p>way is!”</p><p><br></p><p>The mystic said, “The short way has a condition: it is only for those
who are ready to go right now. I give another chance – stand up!”</p><p><br></p><p>Even that man’s hand went down, and there was utter silence. And
everybody was looking at each other.…</p><p><br></p><p>The old man died.</p><p><br></p><p>People want the way to be hard and to be long because this is a good
excuse for avoiding – because the way is so long and so hard.<span class=s4></span>life is so short and so many problems, so many
responsibilities;</p><p>so much has to be done. The children are growing up, they have to be
married, the business is not good – or the business is so good that this
is not the moment to meditate.</p><p><br></p><p>Upanishad is the shortest possible way. Neither has the disciple to
do anything nor has the master to do anything. Doing is not part of
it.</p><p><br></p><p>I have quoted the great Zen poet Basho many times to you: “Sitting
silently, doing nothing, the spring comes and the grass grows by
itself.” As far as upanishadic methodology is concerned, even doing
nothing is not needed. And what are you going to do even if the grass
grows by itself? Whether you sit silently or not, it will grow. Whether
you sit silently or not, the spring will come. You are unnecessarily
taking the credit for the grass growing by itself – because you have
been sitting silently, doing nothing! Even when you were not, the grass
used to grow; when you will not be here the grass will continue to grow.
It has nothing to do with you.</p><p><br></p><p>The upanishad does not even ask you to sit silently doing nothing.
Even doing nothing is a doing.</p><p>The whole approach of the upanishad is so totally different.<span class=s4></span>the disciple is available, the master is</p><p>overflowing, and something transpires. Nobody is doing it. Nobody can
take the credit for it; hence,</p><p>I say the way of the upanishad is the most mysterious way in the
whole human consciousness and its evolution.</p><p><br></p><p>Zen is mysterious, but yet it can be understood.</p><p><br></p><p>Upanishad is simply mysterious, there is no way of understanding it.
You can have it, you can dissolve into it, but there is no question of
explanation – only experience.</p><p><br></p><p>All over the world there have been mystery schools. In Greece,
Pythagoras founded mystery schools. In the religion of the Jews, Baal
Shem founded a mystery school called Hassidism. In China there is the
mystery school of tao, and when Buddhism reached China a new mystery
school, a chain of new mystery schools opened, ch’an. The same mystery
school, ch’an, reached Japan with the name ‘zen.’ But the word ‘zen’ or
‘ch’an’, or the Buddhist word ‘jhan’ are all different forms of the
Sanskrit word ‘dhyan’.</p><p><br></p><p>In India dhyan has been known for centuries – before Gautam Buddha
ever meditated, that mystery school was there.</p><p><br></p><p>There was the mystery school of tantra. There were the mystery
schools of different types of yoga.</p><p><br></p><p>I have gone through all these schools not as a scholar – that is not
my approach – but as an experiencer. I can say to you: nothing rises
higher than the mystery school of upanishads – because it is the
shortest. Nobody is expected to do anything, and yet the miracle
happens.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 4 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RELIGIOUS SCRIPTURES LIKE THE GITA,
THE KORAN, THE BIBLE, ETC. AND THE UPANISHADS?</p><p><br></p><p>First, THE UPANISHADS are not religious scriptures. They are poetic
expressions of those who have known.</p><p><br></p><p>They are not Hindu, they are not Buddhist, they are not Jaina; they
don’t belong to any religion. They are the experiences of individuals
sitting at the feet of their master – and when the experience
overwhelmed them they danced, they sang, they uttered strange
statements. And these were not made by their minds; it was almost as if
they were just hollow bamboos. Existence has made them flutes; it was
existence itself singing a song.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why no upanishad carries the name of its writer.</p><p><br></p><p>The KORAN belongs to Mohammed, the NEW TESTAMENT belongs to Jesus
Christ, the GITA belongs to Krishna, the DHAMMAPADA belongs to Gautam
Buddha; ISAVASYA UPANISHAD belongs to no one.</p><p><br></p><p>Tremendously courageous people... they have not even signed their
names. In fact, it would have been ugly to sign because they were not
the writers, they were not the composers, they were not the poets. The
poetry was coming from above, from beyond. They were simply
vehicles.</p><p>Because of this... you will be surprised also to know that the whole
KORAN consists of Hazrat Mohammed’s statements, the GITA consists
totally of Krishna’s statements, but each upanishad consists of many
peoples’ expressions – anybody who had reached to that beyond and
allowed the beyond to descend through him.</p><p><br></p><p>THE UPANISHADS have not bothered to collect the words of one person.
Each upanishad contains the words of many enlightened people, and
without any signatures. Words have never been so golden. Words have
never taken such high flights, and yet the people who allowed them to
happen have remained anonymous. This is so beautiful, immensely
beautiful, because they knew that, “We have nothing to do. We have just
been passages. Something has come through us.”</p><p><br></p><p>One upanishadic rishi, one upanishadic seer – the name, of course, is
unknown – is reported to have said, “If there is any mistake in my
statement, that is mine. And if there is any truth, I cannot claim that
it is mine. The truth belongs to the universe; the mistake belongs to
me, I was not such a good vehicle.” These were rare people, unique human
beings, the very salt of the earth.</p><p><br></p><p>I would like my sannyasins to become this very salt of the earth
again.</p><p><br></p><p>It is because these are not religious scriptures, that’s why there is
no religion following THE UPANISHADS. These are the very few books which
contain the greatest quantity of truth and have remained unorganized.
There is no organization around them; there cannot be. Because of the
very methodology there cannot be a church, there cannot be a pope or a
shankaracharya.</p><p><br></p><p>I love someone, but I cannot make an organization of it. And when I
leave this body I will leave in heritage my wealth, my house, my land,
everything – but I cannot leave my love in heritage.</p><p><br></p><p>These UPANISHADS are pure love, so there have been no successors, no
priests, no followers. These books are the most pure in the whole world,
absolutely without any pollution. They have remained just the way they
were expressed.</p><p><br></p><p>Nobody has fought because of THE UPANISHADS.</p><p><br></p><p>Mohammedans have fought because of the KORAN. Hindus have fought
because of the GITA. Christians have fought because of the NEW
TESTAMENT. Everybody has been fighting for their religious
scripture.</p><p><br></p><p>Who cares about the poor UPANISHADS? But it has been fortunate that
nobody has bothered about them; they have remained as pure as when they
were given birth to, as innocent as ever.</p><p><br></p><p>The statements in THE UPANISHADS – there are one hundred and twelve
upanishads; the statements in THE UPANISHADS cannot be made into dogmas
for the simple reason that the statements are not rational, logical.
They are contradictory.</p><p><br></p><p>One upanishad says, “I do not know who created the world.” You cannot
make a religion on such a statement: I do not know who created the
world. Then what do you know? – because that is going to be the basis of
any religion: the belief in God, the belief in creation. But like an
innocent child, the upanishadic seer says, “I do not know who created
the world.” And this is closer to truth: nobody</p><p>knows who created the world. Nobody knows whether anybody ever
created it – it may have been always there. And it seems most scientific
that it has always been there and it will remain always there.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole idea of creation is stupid. But if you drop the idea of
creation you have to drop the idea of a creator god. Then you have to
drop the idea of the priest and the pope and the prophets and the
messiah and the saviors and the reincarnations of God. There is no God.
Then from where are reincarnations happening?</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard.… A crazy man had applied to be given a job on a ship.
He was interviewed. The captain and the high officials of the ship asked
him, “If the ocean is in a turmoil and there is danger to the ship, what
are you going to do?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Simple...”.</p><p><br></p><p>Whenever a situation like that happens, they drop heavy loads by the
side of the ship, to keep the ship anchored. Those heavy loads are
called anchors.</p><p><br></p><p>So the man said, “No problem. I will just drop a big anchor.”</p><p><br></p><p>The captain said, “But if another great turmoil comes – because these
things happen in a chain, a great wave – what you are going to do?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “The same – another anchor. And if the third one comes,
another anchor, and the fourth one comes, another anchor.”</p><p><br></p><p>The captain said, “Stop! First tell me, from where are you getting
these anchors?”</p><p><br></p><p>The man said, “You are just as crazy as I am. From where are you
getting all these turmoils? From the same place, I go on getting the
anchors.”</p><p><br></p><p>One fallacy, one false statement, one fictitious idea gives birth to
another fictitious idea.</p><p><br></p><p>First you ask who created the world; immediately God comes in – one
anchor. But somebody is bound to ask, “Who created God?” – another
anchor; a bigger god created this smaller god. But the questions cannot
stop. You have started a fictitious thing; now there is no way to stop.
You will have to go on creating bigger gods, and the person will have to
go on getting bigger anchors.</p><p><br></p><p>THE UPANISHADS are not religious scriptures. They don’t give you any
belief system. They don’t tell you to believe in anything. They don’t
have any god, they don’t have any creation. All that they have is a deep
harmony between the master and the disciple. And that harmony brings
such peace, such serenity, such tranquility, that all questions
disappear – not that you found an answer, no. Just all questions
disappear. The question of finding an answer does not arise; you don’t
have any question, how can you have an answer?</p><p><br></p><p>So THE UPANISHADS don’t have any answer for anybody.</p><p>That’s why people have not taken much note of them, because they
don’t have any answer for you. You have questions, you want answers.</p><p><br></p><p>THE UPANISHADS don’t have any answers. They are ready to take you
into a different dimension of existence, to transmute you. It is a
change of consciousness. And suddenly all doubts, all questions,
everything disappears and what is left behind is just a beautiful
peace.</p><p><br></p><p>Hence, every upanishad ends with om shanti, shanti, shanti. That word
shanti means absolute silence. Beyond that silence there is nothing, and
there is no need. It brings total contentment, absolute blissfulness,
ultimate ecstasy.</p><p><br></p><p>THE UPANISHADS are the only free, absolutely free books as far as
religious books are concerned. All religious books are imprisoned –
Hindus have their prisons, Mohammedans have theirs, Christians have
theirs. Nobody has dared to imprison THE UPANISHADS for the simple
reason that those UPANISHADS are of no use as far as the priesthood is
concerned, creating organization is concerned, exploiting people is
concerned, giving false beliefs is concerned. Those UPANISHADS are
dangerous; it is better to keep them aside.</p><p><br></p><p>The moment a book becomes a holy scripture it becomes poisoned. Then
it is nothing but a strategy to make more and more slaves.</p><p><br></p><p>THE UPANISHADS cannot be condemned for doing any ugly thing to
humanity. They have given their fragrance, they have blossomed, they
have shared their joy – and with such beauty, such clarity – and without
any loopholes, so that it is impossible to make them religious
scriptures. They are truly religious. They are not scriptures, they are
truly spiritual.</p><p><br></p><p>In the whole of history there are only a very few books which have
remained uncontaminated by the cunningness of human mind. THE UPANISHADS
are those few books.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 5 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>WHAT IS YOUR BUSINESS?</p><p><br></p><p>My business is to keep many people in business!</p><p><br></p><p>All the religions have been teaching people to renounce the world. My
business is to help people not to renounce the world. Be in
business!</p><p><br></p><p>All the religions, without exception, are against life. My business
is to destroy the conditionings that have been forced upon you against
life; to give you a joy in life, to make you love life, sing, dance –
because life is a celebration.</p><p><br></p><p>My business is to create this whole existence into a celebration.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part8>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

I CANNOT HOLD ON TO ANY CONCRETE THOUGHT; EVERYTHING DISAPPEARS AS IF IN A WHITE, LIGHT CLOUD.\nON ONE SIDE IT IS LIKE COMING HOME AFTER ALL THIS INTENSE LONGING, AND ON THE OTHER SIDE THE FEAR OF BECOMING CRAZY COMES UP.\nIS THIS THE FEAR OF LOSING CONTROL, OR THE FIRST STEP OF BECOMING A DISCIPLE AND PART OF A DIVINE MADNESS?\nAM I ON THE RIGHT PATH?\nKavish, the mind is the wrong path, and the no-mind is the right path.\nMind is basically mad, and sanity is possible only, blossoms only, in a state of no-mind. If this is remembered, then nothing else is needed.\nComing close to me, your mind is bound to disappear for the simple reason that I am not a mind. The closer you come to me, the more you will be filled with a silence, serenity, no-mindness.\nIt is also natural that you will feel a little tear, because you have lived your whole life with the mind. And in the world it is being taught to everybody that losing the mind is madness. It is not the whole truth, because no madman ever loses his mind; in fact, the madman is lost in the mind – his mind has become a jungle and he cannot find a way out of it. It is not that he has lost his mind, he is lost in his mind. He is more mind than he ever was before.\nThe madman has more mind than you have. Your mind is not so uncontrollable, not so big, not so vast; it is a normal size, manageable. The madman has lost himself in a vast, unlimited jungle of thoughts, desires, dreams.\nSo the maxim that “losing the mind is madness” is not right; it has to be changed. Losing yourself in the mind is madness. And if you understand this, then the definition of sanity is simple: coming out of the mind into the open, into the silence, where no thought, no desire disturbs you.\nYou are just a pool of silence, not even a ripple on it – this is sanity.\nBut because you have lived your whole life in the mind, the first step out of the mind will look dangerous. You arc going, according to the world, into craziness. According to me, you are going into sanity. And you can be a witness to it, because when you are close to me and the mind disappears... are you saner or more insane than you usually are in your day-to-day life?\nIn the silence of no-mind, how you can be crazy?\nCraziness needs contradictory thoughts, irrelevant thoughts, inconsistent thoughts dragging you in all directions, pulling you into pieces. You are somehow holding yourself together, but you know that if you drop control even for a single moment you will fall into pieces. And it will be impossible to put those pieces together again – who will do it?\nThe mind is afraid.\nBut this is one part of being with a master: without your knowing, you have already come out of the mind for a moment. You have tasted, experienced that there is no fear of going crazy. And the farther you go beyond mind, the more intelligent you become.\nRemember, intelligence is not part of the mind. Intellect is, but intelligence is not; hence, the intellectual is full of mind but in life he behaves very unintelligently. He has a certain expertise, he is trained intellectually to, do a certain thing, his mind is functioning like a computer. But life is not one-dimensional, you cannot exhaust it in one expertise; it is multi-dimensional.\nIt is a well-known fact that the great intellectuals of the world have all been found to be unintelligent outside their field of work. I will give you a few examples...\nKarl Marx was certainly one of the great intellectuals. Now he rules over half of humanity, and perhaps will rule over the whole of humanity one day. He has defeated all – Gautam Buddha, Jesus, Mohammed, Moses. Now communism is the greatest religion in the world, and Marx is their god.\nHis expertise was in economics, particularly the economic divisions of society-the classes, the class struggle. He was tremendously accurate, very factual, very historical, and utterly scientific. He called his philosophy “scientific materialism.”\nHe was a chain smoker, and he used to smoke the costliest and the best cigarettes. And he never worked, he never earned anything; he was talking about capitalism and against capitalism, and he was dependent on a friend who was a capitalist – Friedrich Engels, who was a great industrialist. Engels was supporting him throughout his whole life. And Karl Marx was living exactly the bourgeois life he was against: he was not producing anything, he was not creative, he was not a worker. He was not a member of the proletariat, and he was living luxuriously.\nHis wife was disturbed, his friend was disturbed, his doctor was disturbed – this chain smoking was going to destroy his health. But he was incurable. He could not think without smoking – there was a certain association, because he had always been smoking and thinking. The moment he would stop smoking, the thinking would also stop – they had become associated, entangled in each other. To think, he needed to smoke.\nOne day... his wife could not believe it, he was coming home with big boxes full of very cheap cigarettes. His wife said, “But this is not your brand. This is the cheapest cigarette.”\nHe said, “A great thought occurred to me when I went to purchase the cigarettes. Just as I was standing there, somebody was purchasing this brand of cigarette; I thought, ‘My God, these cigarettes are so cheap that one cigarette of my brand is equal to six cigarettes of this brand. If I start smoking these cigarettes, I can save so much money... and the more I smoke the more I will save money!“’ And he was smoking like crazy. He went into his study and started smoking... he was throwing away half-smoked cigarettes and burning new ones.\nHis wife thought he had gone mad. “How can you save money if you are destroying cigarettes like this?”\nTheoretically, intellectually, he was right you smoke one cigarette and you have saved the cost of five cigarettes. But nothing is actually saved. His friend was called, his doctor... and he wouldn’t listen to them: he said, “You don’t understand economics. It is absolutely rational and logical what I am doing.”\nBut the friend brought his servants together and said, “Take all the cigarettes out of the house – and what nonsense is this economics you are thinking about? You will burn your lungs!”\nKarl Marx said, “In my whole life I have found only one thing by which I could have earned some money, but strange... my wife is against it, my friend is against it, my doctor is against it, the neighbors are against it – even my servants are against it! And nobody understands economics.”\nHe was intellectual, but not intelligent. Intelligence is a totally different affair.\nIt happened after the Russian revolution... What is now the city of Stalingrad was called Petrograd before the revolution. It was named after Peter the Great – “Petrograd.” Just in front of the palace there was a big rock, a very beautiful rock. Lenin, the chief architect of the Russian revolution, wanted to remove that rock because the rock was not allowing modern vehicles, cars, buses, to move on the road; they had to go around and take a longer route. It was perfectly okay when there were no cars, but that rock was not needed at all there in the middle of the road. The rock was very big; engineers were called, all kinds of suggestions were made about what should be done. A\npoor man with his oxcart was standing there, looking and watching what was happening. Finally he laughed, and Lenin asked him, “Why are you laughing?”\nHe said, “I am a poor man; I don’t understand anything about what these great engineers are thinking. But it is a very simple matter... and they seem to be finding it almost impossible to remove it. There is no need to remove it. Just dig a hole around the rock; go on digging the hole and pulling out the mud. The rock will sit deeper in the hole and it won’t be a barrier. You need not be worried how to take it out, there is no need. It can just become part of the road – it is such a beautiful rock. But I am a poor farmer. I may be absolutely wrong, I don’t know. But this is how we work in our fields if some problem arises.”\nLenin has written in his diary, “That day I felt that to be intellectually trained is one thing, and to have intelligence is something else. That poor man had intelligence – no training, no education, but a simple insight.” And that’s what has been done. The rock is still there; it has just been sunk into the road.\nMind, at its best, can be a great intellectual but it can never be a great intelligence. Intelligence needs freshness.\nIntellect can only do that which it has been trained for. It is just like a parrot; it can repeat exactly what you have taught it. It is a computer: First you have to feed it, feed it the information; then the computer has a memory system – it keeps it, and whenever you need it the computer is ready to give you the information back. But don’t ask any question which is new; the computer will not be able to give the answer.\nIt has no intelligence.\nThe same is the situation of the mind. Have you observed it or not?\nIt can give answers which you are educated about, informed about, which you have studied, which in some way are stored in the memory bank of your mind. It can give them back to you whenever you need them. But if something new arises, it may be very small... the mind is absolutely impotent to find an answer for it, because the information is not there in the bank; it is not part of the memory.\nMind is memory, not intelligence.\nIntelligence is when you encounter new things, new problems, and your being mirrors those new problems and finds answers for them. You have never been told about them, you have never studied them. Your memory is absolutely incapable of supplying an answer.\nGreat intellectuals find new problems, are always in difficulty. It is said that one day Albert Einstein, one of the greatest mathematicians of the world, entered a bus to go to the university and gave some money to the conductor. The conductor gave him the ticket and some money back, the change from the money that he had given. He counted the money and he said, “You are cheating me.”\nThe conductor said, “Perhaps... just let me count again.” He counted, and told Albert Einstein, “It seems you don’t know figures; you don’t know how to count. Just keep quiet and sit down.”\nHe told his wife, “It was a very embarrassing situation; the whole bus laughed, It was good that there were. no professors or students; nobody knew that I am Albert Einstein and the conductor is saying, ‘You don’t know figures.’ And I have dealt with the biggest figures in the whole history of man, my whole work is figures. But I thought it was better not to make any fuss about it. You just count this money and see whether he was cheating me or I was wrong.”\nThe wife counted it, and she said, “It is perfectly right. Looking at your ticket, your money and the money you gave him, it is perfectly right. And it seems that you DON’T know how to count! You have become so accustomed to big figures, figures with hundreds of zeros behind them, that just small figures you have forgotten. You should never say anything to anybody; if any such situation arises, keep quiet.”\nOne of my friends, Doctor Ramamanohar Lohia, had gone to see Albert Einstein – Doctor Lohia was educated in Germany. And he reached exactly on time. Albert Einstein’s wife said, “You will have to wait a little. I cannot be sure how long, because he is in his bath and he never likes to be disturbed while he is in his bath. And one never knows how long he will take.”\nDoctor Lohia said, “I can wait.” He thought maybe fifteen minutes, half an hour – what more can one do in a bath? Six hours... the wife gave him breakfast, the wife gave him lunch... and he said, “My God, and he is still in his tub? What is he doing?”\nThe wife said, “In the beginning when we were married, I used to disturb him and that kept him angry the whole day. He would throw things, and he would make all kinds of nuisance and shout. He gets very much disturbed, because he has made all his discoveries about the stars in his tub, in his tub with a bubble bath. He goes on playing with bubbles, soap bubbles... for him, those soap bubbles are stars. And he works out... I don’t know how he works it out, but he works it out – he has written all over the bathroom on the walls. I will show you his bathroom; it is all mathematics.”\nAnd after six hours Albert Einstein came out, and he said, “So you have come? You have come just at the right time. Just as I come out of the bathroom, you are sitting here.”\nDoctor Lohia said, “I have been sitting here for six hours!”\nHe said, “My God! But just forgive me, because when I am in my tub with the soap bubbles then I forget time completely. Then only stars and all the equations about new stars, their distances... you should see my bathroom.”\nAnd Doctor Lohia told me, “They both took me to the bathroom. All the walls had great equations” – beyond his capacity because he was not a mathematician. He said, “You have made the bathroom your lab.”\nHe said, “I have not made it, it has become a lab by itself. These soap bubbles somehow resemble stars.”\nNow, this man is one of the greatest intellects. But he was the cause of an unintelligent thing, an ugly and inhuman thing that happened. He was the cause of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, because he wrote a letter to President Roosevelt of America: “I can make atom bombs. And just that you have atom bombs will be enough, there is no need to drop them. Just having them will be enough for Germany and Japan to surrender.” But this was an unintelligent thing to do.\nRoosevelt allowed him, gave him all the facilities to make atom bombs. He made the atom bombs, and once they were made they were in the hands of the politicians. And he was writing – Roosevelt was no longer president, Truman became president, and he was writing to Truman – “Those bombs should not be used. In the letter, that was my first condition.” And Truman never replied. Who cares? You have done your work, you have been paid for your work. You are not the master of the bombs – the bombs belong to the government.\nAnd Truman dropped those bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki without any reason. Germany had already failed and accepted its failure. And Japan was ready any day... the experts say that at the most, one week or two weeks and Japan was going to surrender. Japan could not stand alone without Germany. And there was no need to destroy two cities of civilians who had nothing to do with the war – children, women, old men, mothers, pregnant women, who have nothing to do with war. And not a small number – each city was more than one hundred thousand people. Two hundred thousand people...\nBut Truman was interested to drop those atom bombs as quickly as possible, because if Japan surrenders then you cannot drop them. Then there is no change – where to experiment? And he wanted to experiment.\nThis was an experiment.\nTwo hundred thousand people died.\nAnd for generations the effect of those two bombs will continue, not only in human beings; in the fish, in the animals, in the trees – everywhere, the radiation will continue.\nAt that time Albert Einstein was crying and saying, “I am an unintelligent man. I could not see a simple thing: that once you give power to the politicians it has gone beyond your hands, you cannot do anything.”\nHis dying words were, “I would like to be born in my next life as a plumber, not as a physicist, because I don’t want to commit such murderous acts again. And it was my foolishness...” Although what he proposed was very intellectual, it was not intelligent: “Just the very show of power is enough.”\nBut politicians are so hungry to show their power that without making it actually felt by the whole world... They will not be able to restrain themselves.\nHave you seen two dogs fighting? Most probably they will bark at each other, jump at each other, and you will see that there is going to be a bloody fight – but nothing happens. They judge and see who is stronger, and once it is accepted by both that one is stronger than the other, there is no need to fight. Then one dog simply puts his tail down, gives the signal: “Stop it. You are the winner, I am the defeated and we can still be good friends.”\nDogs are more intelligent than politicians. This is an intelligent way to see it – “What is the point now? It is so clear that I am weaker than the other; what is the point in unnecessarily getting fractured bones and blood? It can be decided just by shouting and jumping and making the whole show: it is going to happen, now it is going to happen...” But it never happens. One dog understands, and immediately he drops his tail.\nYou must have seen that if you approach a house and the dog is not aware whether you are a friend or a foe, he does both things: he barks at you, and he goes on waving his tail. One never knows which way things turn out – if it turns out to be a friend, barking will stop and he is already waving his tail, “Welcome!” So he is just waiting, intelligently, for the time when the owner of the house comes out. Then he can see whether this man is friendly or not. Before that, he is doing both things.\nNow, dogs are not very intellectual, but they are intelligent. You will find intelligence in all the animals.\nNow they even say that intelligence is in the trees – and it has been found in strange ways. Now, trees are not intellectuals. You don’t see them going to school with books or going to the library. No intellectual work is visible, but intelligence is there. It has been found that one tree the scientists were studying... there was no water near the tree, but there was a pipeline two hundred feet away. And the tree in some way found out, and all its roots went in that direction – and it was a pipeline; it was not that water was available.\nBut those roots tied themselves around the water pipe so tightly that it broke, and they were getting a supply of water from two hundred feet away. And the tree remained green and was giving flowers. And when the scientists were digging, they were surprised: how did the tree roots find out that they had to go towards the north and not towards the south? They went right in the direction of the water, as if there was a subtle intelligence, a sensitivity. And they broke the pipeline and they managed to get the water which was not available from the earth.\nAnd now they have found that trees and plants have intelligence in many ways – such deep intelligence that perhaps we are far behind.\nCertain instruments like cardiograms have been made, which are attached to a tree. and a woodcutter is told to go and cut a branch from the tree, and the woodcutter goes with his axe. As he is coming near the tree, the cardiogram starts showing that the tree is trembling with fear; the graph on the paper starts trembling. It had been going very symmetrically... as the woodcutter comes closer, there is more trembling, more ups and more downs – and the woodcutter has not cut the tree yet.\nIt seems that the very idea in the mind of the wood-cutter is in some way being read by the tree – a certain kind of telepathy, a certain kind of thought reading. And they have tried sending another woodcutter – who is not going to cut, he is told just to pass by the side of the tree with his axe – and the cardiogram remains symmetrical. Because there is no idea in the man to cut the tree; the tree is not worried, there is no fear.\nOur minds are broadcasting every moment whatsoever is in our minds. Trees are getting it. Man seems to be dumb – you don’t know if somebody is coming to kill you or pick your pocket – but the tree knows. A different way of knowing must be...\nThe man who goes beyond mind is not crazy, but enters into a different way of knowing, a different way of understanding the world, a different way of responding to reality – more intelligently, more sensitively, more lovingly, more humanely.\nKavish, don’t be worried about it. This is the first step, and this is the right step. Question 2\nBELOVED OSHO,\nI GOT THE POINT NOW THAT BEING TOTALLY IN THE HEART IS ONLY THE BEGINNING, AND THAT THE JOURNEY IS NEVER-ENDING.\nNOW SOMETIMES I FEEL THAT IN THE OLD POONA STORIES ENLIGHTENMENT WAS MUCH EASIER THAN WHEN YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT IT NOW. IS IT BECAUSE WE TOOK THE FIRST STEP, AND NOW YOU ARE SHOWING US THE NEXT ONE?\nIt is certain that in my earlier teachings to you, enlightenment appeared to be much easier. It had to, because I did not want you to freak out. Now I can trust that even if I say the truth you are not going to escape. Enlightenment is not easy.\nBut how to persuade people? They are so much engaged in futile things, and if you give them a very difficult idea, which becomes prohibitive, they simply say, “We will see. Perhaps in some life some time – and what is the hurry? Eternity is available. The small things that we are engaged in doing right now will not be available for eternity, so let us finish them first.”\nAnd they will go on putting enlightenment as the last item on their list.\nThere is an old, ancient story in India about Kind Yayati. His death came; he was one hundred years old, he had done everything that you can do – conquered lands, had beautiful wives, had one hundred sons from those wives, had all the treasure that one can imagine. But man’s desire is inexhaustible. He said to death, “It is too early; I have not yet completed my experiences on the earth. You will have to give me at least one hundred years more.”\nDeath said, “I can give you one hundred years on one condition: if one of your sons is ready to die in your place. Because anyway I have to take somebody, I cannot go empty-handed. Bureaucracy is bureaucracy, nobody bothers there – just somebody’s body, and the register is marked that ‘Yes, Yayati has died.’ So if one of your sons... and you have one hundred sons...”\nYayati said, “There is no problem, my sons love me so much.”\nHe called his sons... and his sons were not children. Somebody was eighty years old, somebody was seventy-five, somebody was seventy. They themselves were old, but nobody was willing to die. Just the youngest son, who was only seventeen, as yet unmarried, had just come from his gurukula, from his master’s home – he came forward and he said, “You can take me. If this can give my father one hundred years I will be immensely happy.”\nEven death felt tremendous compassion for the boy. Death said, “Can’t you see your ninety-nine brothers? – nobody is willing. They are coming close to their own death. There is not much to lose for the one who is eighty years old – any day his own death is going to come. You are too young, you don’t understand what you are doing. Think twice.”\nHe said, “I have thought about it. Exactly the same reasons that you are giving me... my father has lived one hundred years and is unsatisfied; my ninety-nine brothers have lived and yet none is ready to die. That is enough proof for me that in this life, satisfaction is not possible. At least give me this satisfaction, that I have given to my father what he has given to me; I give it back to him. It is useless, life.”\nUnwillingly, death had to take him away.\nOne hundred years passed and death was back, and Yayati said, “My God, I forgot completely about the fact that after a hundred years you would be back again. Everything is incomplete.”\nAnd this went on happening. When Yayati became one thousand years old... Ten times death came, and every time the youngest son sacrificed himself for the father.\nIt has tremendous implications: The old mind is not ready to die; even if you give it one thousand years to live, it clings to life. only the youngest is bold enough to go into death without entering into the ups and downs, days and nights, summers and winters of life.\nBut after one thousand years when death came, Yayati said, “This time... things are still incomplete, but I have understood that they will remain always incomplete. You can take me. And I am ashamed that I did not understand at all. I have sacrificed my young sons – who were innocent, but more intelligent; they had more insight. They could-see that satisfaction, contentment, completion is not possible here in this life.” – You are engaged in a thousand and one things, and you will have to leave them all incomplete – houses half built, businesses half successful lives... yet asking for a little more time. You will die like a beggar, not like an emperor. You will not embrace death, you will be dragged by death unwillingly, reluctantly.\nHere, if I say to you enlightenment is very difficult, you will put it down at the very bottom of your life. I have to say to people that it is very easy, it is easier than anything else in the world, it is the easiest thing. And once you have become interested in enlightenment then, slowly slowly, I can tell you, “Don’t be stupid.” But I will say it only when the time is ripe.\nIt is the greatest challenge to those who really want to understand themselves and the existence surrounding them. However difficult it may be, it will remain their priority. Everything else is secondary, because nothing else is going to give you the taste of eternal life, of immortal being, of peace that passeth understanding. Nothing else is going to help you come out of the darkness in which you have lived for lives and lives – groping, groaning.\nIt call bring you, in the darkest night of your life, the most beautiful dawn.\nIt is difficult in the proportion in which you demand it: if it is your first priority, it is not that difficult; if it is your last priority, it is very difficult, almost impossible. But you have come a long way, and even\nif I say that it is a journey that never ends you can understand its beauty – you are not going to be afraid of a journey that never ends.\nWhen for the first time railway trains started in London, the first train was going for only eight miles. But all the churches, the bishops and cardinals and the archbishop of England, were condemning the railway train, saying that God never made the railway train; if it was needed for human beings he would have made it himself. Such a clear-cut logic. It is certainly the devil’s trick – and the train also looks like a devil, particularly the old engines look like the devil. And they made people afraid – “Don’t sit in it.”\nThere was no ticket, and lunch was served free. But the bishops were saying to the people, “You don’t know one thing: it will start, but what is the guarantee that it will stop? And if it does not stop, then what? What will you do? Just one lunch – finish! Just for one lunch the whole life is finished.”\nAnd certainly nobody had seen a train stopping. Never had a train started, never had a train stopped; there was no precedent. Nobody could say with any guarantee that it would stop. Even the engineers, the scientists, could not say it with a guarantee; they said, “We know it will stop, but a guarantee? How can we give a guarantee? We have to see.”\nWith great difficulty... Only a few people went, half a dozen in the whole train, daredevils who said, “okay, if it doesn’t stop that will do. If it is going to hell then we will go to hell – but we will see what happens. But lunch we cannot... a free lunch we cannot pass up.”\nSo only half a dozen... And people were trying, their families were trying to convince them, “Come down, don’t go just for one lunch. Don’t kill yourself! Can’t you see the face of the train?” But the train stopped, and there was great rejoicing.\nPeople are afraid of anything that is unending.\nBut those who know should be afraid of things which end. Unending things should be the great attractions.\nSo now I can say you are on an unending journey, where you will have overnight stops but you will never come to an end – no terminus, no Victoria Station.\nQuestion 3 BELOVED OSHO,\nI AM NOTICING THAT THE QUESTIONS YOU ARE ANSWERING ARE ANSWERING MINE. BUT THE QUESTIONS I HAVE BEEN SUBMITTING ARE NOT AS ARTICULATE AND SEEM TO BE LESS CLEAR THAN THOSE YOU ARE ANSWERING.\nNOW IS THE TIME FOR US TO HAVE YOU ANSWER ALL OF OUR QUESTIONS.\nWHAT SURPRISES AND SHOCKS ME IS THAT AT ONE TIME I CONSIDERED MYSELF ARTICULATE. NOW MY QUESTIONS ARE LIKE FLAMES IN MY HEART – WORDLESS, BEAUTIFUL, BURNING.\nOSHO, CAN YOU SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THE NECESSITY FOR A DISCIPLE TO BE ABLE TO ARTICULATE THE QUESTIONS THAT ARE BURNING WITHIN?\nThe disciple who has a burning question but is not articulate enough to put it into words is blessed. It is not something that one should feel sad about. It is something that should make one feel profoundly fortunate because to have a question which you cannot bring into words is to have a real question.\nReal questions cannot be brought into words.\nBut real questions will be answered. Whether you can bring them into words or not, it doesn’t matter.\nIn fact, I am taking care of all those questions which are in your hearts but cannot find a way into language. They are the most important.\nSo whatever questions you ask me, I use them as an excuse to answer many other questions which are not asked.\nBut remember: if you have a – question, it cannot remain unanswered. I am here just for those questions.\nQuestion 4 BELOVED OSHO,\nIN THE MAD GAME OF MASTER AND DISCIPLE, I REMEMBER HEARING YOU SAY IN POONA THAT THE MASTER CHOOSES THE DISCIPLE FIRST – BEFORE THE DISCIPLE FEELS THAT HE HAS CHOSEN THE MASTER.\nOSHO, DOES THE MASTER LEAVE THE DISCIPLE BEFORE THE DISCIPLE CAN BETRAY THE MASTER?\nThat’s true. The unconscious disciple has no choice, either in choosing the master or leaving the master. It is only the conscious master who chooses the disciple, and if he feels that it is not the right time for the disciple, he drops him. But he drops him with such grace that the disciple always thinks that he has dropped the master.\nWhile choosing also, the disciple thinks he has chosen the master. In your sleep you cannot choose who is going to awaken you. In your sleep you can only dream You cannot have any glimpse of reality on either end – choosing a master or leaving a master.\nThe master chooses a disciple seeing some potential, some possibility of flowering. But there are disciples whose pace of growth is so slow that it may take lives for them; then it is better to leave them. Some other gardener will work on them. It is better not to start working on them, because leaving incomplete work is creating a difficulty for the disciple.\nThe master is not going to come back again in the next life. If I cannot complete your work in this life, I will not begin it. Then it is better to leave you tabula rasa; somebody else somewhere in your future life may do the work. He will have his own designs, he will have his own devices.\nZunnun, one Sufi master, used to say to each new disciple that arrived, “Have you ever been a disciple to another master? If you have, then my fee will be double. If you have never been a disciple of any other master then my usual fee will do.”\nPeople were puzzled. They would say, “We thought that since we have learned so much from other masters and now we have come to you... You should not charge a double fee – you should charge half of the fee or no fee at all.”\nBut Zunnun said, “You don’t understand: first I will have to undo whatever the other masters have done, because our designs are different, our devices are differ-ent, so my work is complicated. A person who comes fresh is simpler to work with.”\nSo if I see-that a certain person is not going to develop, that whatever is done he is going to waste time, he is not in an urgency – and I am in an urgency – then it is better to say goodbye to him. But it will be hard on him to make him feel that he has been left out. The better way is to create a situation in which he himself leaves, feeling perfectly good that he has left.\nHe is given a false opportunity to think that he has chosen the master and he is given a false opportunity to feel that he has left the master. But on both occasions it is the master who is basically responsible.\nQuestion 5 BELOVED OSHO,\nWHEREVER YOU ARE, THERE IS A FESTIVITY AND CELEBRATION. WHAT IS THIS WONDERFUL PHENOMENON?\nNarendra, festivity and celebration are our natural states; you have just forgotten them.\nWhen you come to me, you suddenly remember that there is no need to be sad, no need to be miserable, that life wants you to sing and dance, that life is not serious, but playfulness.\nThe ancient seers used to call it leela; that word can only be translated as ‘playfulness’. It is God’s playfulness.\nYou just have to be reminded.\nAnybody who knows it... being close to him, you see your face in his mirror. And suddenly there is a remembrance, and your misery disappears – because your misery is false, your sadness is false. Celebration is your truth. It has nothing to do with me; it is just that in my presence you forget for a moment your false mask of misery. Suddenly you-feel-a joy, a cheerfulness, a fragrance arising in you. It is not mine.\nI am just a reminder, just a mirror. Seeing your face, there is celebration.\nYou cannot see your face without a mirror, that is a difficulty.\nI have heard that Mulla Nasruddin found a mirror on the road. He had never seen a mirror – some traveler passing by the side of the village may have dropped the mirror. He looked in the mirror and said, “My God, this is my father! And this old cheat used to have a photograph of himself and we never knew about it.”\nHe took the mirror home. He did not want to show it to his wife because an unnecessary quarrel would arise – any point was enough – so he went upstairs. The wife was looking out of the corner of her eye... “That old fellow is certainly doing something, the way he has entered.” And as he left the house, she went upstairs. He had hidden it inside a box underneath his clothes, but she found it. No husband can hide anything which the wife cannot find, it has never happened.\nShe looked into the mirror and she said, “My God, in this old age... and he is having a love affair. And with this old woman, rotten!”\nIt is the mirror.\nWithout the mirror you would not have been able to know how you look. The mirror is certainly a great invention.\nThe master is also a mirror – not for this body and this face, but for your original face, for your real being, for your inner flame. And the moment you see it, suddenly you feel all darkness, all misery, all sadness gone, and there is celebration.\nWherever the master is, there is Kaaba, there is Kashi, because there is a possibility to experience your authentic blissfulness.\nSuddenly a song, a dance – you are no more your old self. At least for the moment you are a new being.\nAnd if you go on remembering this, then the need of the master is not. Whenever you remember yourself there will be celebration, there will be Kaaba, there will be Kashi.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"6510","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_osho_upanishad/part30/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_osho_upanishad/>The Osho Upanishad</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">30 The Taste of No-Mind</h1><div class=post-meta>31 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;6510 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Osho_Upanishad/part30.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part29>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

MORE. I CANNOT HOLD ON TO ANY CONCRETE THOUGHT; EVERYTHING DISAPPEARS AS
IF IN A WHITE, LIGHT CLOUD.</p><p><br></p><p>ON ONE SIDE IT IS LIKE COMING HOME AFTER ALL THIS INTENSE LONGING,
AND ON THE OTHER SIDE THE FEAR OF BECOMING CRAZY COMES UP.</p><p><br></p><p>IS THIS THE FEAR OF LOSING CONTROL, OR THE FIRST STEP OF BECOMING A
DISCIPLE AND PART OF A DIVINE MADNESS?</p><p><br></p><p>AM I ON THE RIGHT PATH?</p><p><br></p><p>Kavish, the mind is the wrong path, and the no-mind is the right
path.</p><p><br></p><p>Mind is basically mad, and sanity is possible only, blossoms only, in
a state of no-mind. If this is remembered, then nothing else is
needed.</p><p><br></p><p>Coming close to me, your mind is bound to disappear for the simple
reason that I am not a mind. The closer you come to me, the more you
will be filled with a silence, serenity, no-mindness.</p><p>It is also natural that you will feel a little tear, because you have
lived your whole life with the mind. And in the world it is being taught
to everybody that losing the mind is madness. It is not the whole truth,
because no madman ever loses his mind; in fact, the madman is lost in
the mind – his mind has become a jungle and he cannot find a way out of
it. It is not that he has lost his mind, he is lost in his mind. He is
more mind than he ever was before.</p><p>The madman has more mind than you have. Your mind is not so
uncontrollable, not so big, not so vast; it is a normal size,
manageable. The madman has lost himself in a vast, unlimited jungle of
thoughts, desires, dreams.</p><p><br></p><p>So the maxim that “losing the mind is madness” is not right; it has
to be changed. Losing yourself in the mind is madness. And if you
understand this, then the definition of sanity is simple: coming out of
the mind into the open, into the silence, where no thought, no desire
disturbs you.</p><p><br></p><p>You are just a pool of silence, not even a ripple on it – this is
sanity.</p><p><br></p><p>But because you have lived your whole life in the mind, the first
step out of the mind will look dangerous. You arc going, according to
the world, into craziness. According to me, you are going into sanity.
And you can be a witness to it, because when you are close to me and the
mind disappears... are you saner or more insane than you usually are in
your day-to-day life?</p><p>In the silence of no-mind, how you can be crazy?</p><p><br></p><p>Craziness needs contradictory thoughts, irrelevant thoughts,
inconsistent thoughts dragging you in all directions, pulling you into
pieces. You are somehow holding yourself together, but you know that if
you drop control even for a single moment you will fall into pieces. And
it will be impossible to put those pieces together again – who will do
it?</p><p>The mind is afraid.</p><p><br></p><p>But this is one part of being with a master: without your knowing,
you have already come out of the mind for a moment. You have tasted,
experienced that there is no fear of going crazy. And the farther you go
beyond mind, the more intelligent you become.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember, intelligence is not part of the mind. Intellect is, but
intelligence is not; hence, the intellectual is full of mind but in life
he behaves very unintelligently. He has a certain expertise, he is
trained intellectually to, do a certain thing, his mind is functioning
like a computer. But life is not one-dimensional, you cannot exhaust it
in one expertise; it is multi-dimensional.</p><p><br></p><p>It is a well-known fact that the great intellectuals of the world
have all been found to be unintelligent outside their field of work. I
will give you a few examples...</p><p><br></p><p>Karl Marx was certainly one of the great intellectuals. Now he rules
over half of humanity, and perhaps will rule over the whole of humanity
one day. He has defeated all – Gautam Buddha, Jesus, Mohammed, Moses.
Now communism is the greatest religion in the world, and Marx is their
god.</p><p><br></p><p>His expertise was in economics, particularly the economic divisions
of society-the classes, the class struggle. He was tremendously
accurate, very factual, very historical, and utterly scientific. He
called his philosophy “scientific materialism.”</p><p>He was a chain smoker, and he used to smoke the costliest and the
best cigarettes. And he never worked, he never earned anything; he was
talking about capitalism and against capitalism, and he was dependent on
a friend who was a capitalist – Friedrich Engels, who was a great
industrialist. Engels was supporting him throughout his whole life. And
Karl Marx was living exactly the bourgeois life he was against: he was
not producing anything, he was not creative, he was not a worker. He was
not a member of the proletariat, and he was living luxuriously.</p><p><br></p><p>His wife was disturbed, his friend was disturbed, his doctor was
disturbed – this chain smoking was going to destroy his health. But he
was incurable. He could not think without smoking – there was a certain
association, because he had always been smoking and thinking. The moment
he would stop smoking, the thinking would also stop – they had become
associated, entangled in each other. To think, he needed to smoke.</p><p><br></p><p>One day... his wife could not believe it, he was coming home with big
boxes full of very cheap cigarettes. His wife said, “But this is not
your brand. This is the cheapest cigarette.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “A great thought occurred to me when I went to purchase the
cigarettes. Just as I was standing there, somebody was purchasing this
brand of cigarette; I thought, ‘My God, these cigarettes are so cheap
that one cigarette of my brand is equal to six cigarettes of this brand.
If I start smoking these cigarettes, I can save so much money... and the
more I smoke the more I will save money!“’ And he was smoking like
crazy. He went into his study and started smoking... he was throwing
away half-smoked cigarettes and burning new ones.</p><p><br></p><p>His wife thought he had gone mad. “How can you save money if you are
destroying cigarettes like this?”</p><p><br></p><p>Theoretically, intellectually, he was right you smoke one cigarette
and you have saved the cost of five cigarettes. But nothing is actually
saved. His friend was called, his doctor... and he wouldn’t listen to
them: he said, “You don’t understand economics. It is absolutely
rational and logical what I am doing.”</p><p><br></p><p>But the friend brought his servants together and said, “Take all the
cigarettes out of the house – and what nonsense is this economics you
are thinking about? You will burn your lungs!”</p><p><br></p><p>Karl Marx said, “In my whole life I have found only one thing by
which I could have earned some money, but strange... my wife is against
it, my friend is against it, my doctor is against it, the neighbors are
against it – even my servants are against it! And nobody understands
economics.”</p><p><br></p><p>He was intellectual, but not intelligent. Intelligence is a totally
different affair.</p><p><br></p><p>It happened after the Russian revolution... What is now the city of
Stalingrad was called Petrograd before the revolution. It was named
after Peter the Great – “Petrograd.” Just in front of the palace there
was a big rock, a very beautiful rock. Lenin, the chief architect of the
Russian revolution, wanted to remove that rock because the rock was not
allowing modern vehicles, cars, buses, to move on the road; they had to
go around and take a longer route. It was perfectly okay when there were
no cars, but that rock was not needed at all there in the middle of the
road. The rock was very big; engineers were called, all kinds of
suggestions were made about what should be done. A</p><p>poor man with his oxcart was standing there, looking and watching
what was happening. Finally he laughed, and Lenin asked him, “Why are
you laughing?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I am a poor man; I don’t understand anything about what
these great engineers are thinking. But it is a very simple matter...
and they seem to be finding it almost impossible to remove it. There is
no need to remove it. Just dig a hole around the rock; go on digging the
hole and pulling out the mud. The rock will sit deeper in the hole and
it won’t be a barrier. You need not be worried how to take it out, there
is no need. It can just become part of the road – it is such a beautiful
rock. But I am a poor farmer. I may be absolutely wrong, I don’t know.
But this is how we work in our fields if some problem arises.”</p><p><br></p><p>Lenin has written in his diary, “That day I felt that to be
intellectually trained is one thing, and to have intelligence is
something else. That poor man had intelligence – no training, no
education, but a simple insight.” And that’s what has been done. The
rock is still there; it has just been sunk into the road.</p><p><br></p><p>Mind, at its best, can be a great intellectual but it can never be a
great intelligence. Intelligence needs freshness.</p><p>Intellect can only do that which it has been trained for. It is just
like a parrot; it can repeat exactly what you have taught it. It is a
computer: First you have to feed it, feed it the information; then the
computer has a memory system – it keeps it, and whenever you need it the
computer is ready to give you the information back. But don’t ask any
question which is new; the computer will not be able to give the
answer.</p><p><br></p><p>It has no intelligence.</p><p><br></p><p>The same is the situation of the mind. Have you observed it or
not?</p><p>It can give answers which you are educated about, informed about,
which you have studied, which in some way are stored in the memory bank
of your mind. It can give them back to you whenever you need them. But
if something new arises, it may be very small... the mind is absolutely
impotent to find an answer for it, because the information is not there
in the bank; it is not part of the memory.</p><p><br></p><p>Mind is memory, not intelligence.</p><p><br></p><p>Intelligence is when you encounter new things, new problems, and your
being mirrors those new problems and finds answers for them. You have
never been told about them, you have never studied them. Your memory is
absolutely incapable of supplying an answer.</p><p><br></p><p>Great intellectuals find new problems, are always in difficulty. It
is said that one day Albert Einstein, one of the greatest mathematicians
of the world, entered a bus to go to the university and gave some money
to the conductor. The conductor gave him the ticket and some money back,
the change from the money that he had given. He counted the money and he
said, “You are cheating me.”</p><p>The conductor said, “Perhaps... just let me count again.” He counted,
and told Albert Einstein, “It seems you don’t know figures; you don’t
know how to count. Just keep quiet and sit down.”</p><p><br></p><p>He told his wife, “It was a very embarrassing situation; the whole
bus laughed, It was good that there were. no professors or students;
nobody knew that I am Albert Einstein and the conductor is saying, ‘You
don’t know figures.’ And I have dealt with the biggest figures in the
whole history of man, my whole work is figures. But I thought it was
better not to make any fuss about it. You just count this money and see
whether he was cheating me or I was wrong.”</p><p><br></p><p>The wife counted it, and she said, “It is perfectly right. Looking at
your ticket, your money and the money you gave him, it is perfectly
right. And it seems that you DON’T know how to count! You have become so
accustomed to big figures, figures with hundreds of zeros behind them,
that just small figures you have forgotten. You should never say
anything to anybody; if any such situation arises, keep quiet.”</p><p><br></p><p>One of my friends, Doctor Ramamanohar Lohia, had gone to see Albert
Einstein – Doctor Lohia was educated in Germany. And he reached exactly
on time. Albert Einstein’s wife said, “You will have to wait a little. I
cannot be sure how long, because he is in his bath and he never likes to
be disturbed while he is in his bath. And one never knows how long he
will take.”</p><p><br></p><p>Doctor Lohia said, “I can wait.” He thought maybe fifteen minutes,
half an hour – what more can one do in a bath? Six hours... the wife
gave him breakfast, the wife gave him lunch... and he said, “My God, and
he is still in his tub? What is he doing?”</p><p><br></p><p>The wife said, “In the beginning when we were married, I used to
disturb him and that kept him angry the whole day. He would throw
things, and he would make all kinds of nuisance and shout. He gets very
much disturbed, because he has made all his discoveries about the stars
in his tub, in his tub with a bubble bath. He goes on playing with
bubbles, soap bubbles... for him, those soap bubbles are stars. And he
works out... I don’t know how he works it out, but he works it out – he
has written all over the bathroom on the walls. I will show you his
bathroom; it is all mathematics.”</p><p><br></p><p>And after six hours Albert Einstein came out, and he said, “So you
have come? You have come just at the right time. Just as I come out of
the bathroom, you are sitting here.”</p><p><br></p><p>Doctor Lohia said, “I have been sitting here for six hours!”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “My God! But just forgive me, because when I am in my tub
with the soap bubbles then I forget time completely. Then only stars and
all the equations about new stars, their distances... you should see my
bathroom.”</p><p><br></p><p>And Doctor Lohia told me, “They both took me to the bathroom. All the
walls had great equations” – beyond his capacity because he was not a
mathematician. He said, “You have made the bathroom your lab.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I have not made it, it has become a lab by itself. These
soap bubbles somehow resemble stars.”</p><p>Now, this man is one of the greatest intellects. But he was the cause
of an unintelligent thing, an ugly and inhuman thing that happened. He
was the cause of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, because he wrote a letter to
President Roosevelt of America: “I can make atom bombs. And just that
you have atom bombs will be enough, there is no need to drop them. Just
having them will be enough for Germany and Japan to surrender.” But this
was an unintelligent thing to do.</p><p><br></p><p>Roosevelt allowed him, gave him all the facilities to make atom
bombs. He made the atom bombs, and once they were made they were in the
hands of the politicians. And he was writing – Roosevelt was no longer
president, Truman became president, and he was writing to Truman –
“Those bombs should not be used. In the letter, that was my first
condition.” And Truman never replied. Who cares? You have done your
work, you have been paid for your work. You are not the master of the
bombs – the bombs belong to the government.</p><p><br></p><p>And Truman dropped those bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki without any
reason. Germany had already failed and accepted its failure. And Japan
was ready any day... the experts say that at the most, one week or two
weeks and Japan was going to surrender. Japan could not stand alone
without Germany. And there was no need to destroy two cities of
civilians who had nothing to do with the war – children, women, old men,
mothers, pregnant women, who have nothing to do with war. And not a
small number – each city was more than one hundred thousand people. Two
hundred thousand people...</p><p><br></p><p>But Truman was interested to drop those atom bombs as quickly as
possible, because if Japan surrenders then you cannot drop them. Then
there is no change – where to experiment? And he wanted to
experiment.</p><p><br></p><p>This was an experiment.</p><p><br></p><p>Two hundred thousand people died.</p><p><br></p><p>And for generations the effect of those two bombs will continue, not
only in human beings; in the fish, in the animals, in the trees –
everywhere, the radiation will continue.</p><p><br></p><p>At that time Albert Einstein was crying and saying, “I am an
unintelligent man. I could not see a simple thing: that once you give
power to the politicians it has gone beyond your hands, you cannot do
anything.”</p><p><br></p><p>His dying words were, “I would like to be born in my next life as a
plumber, not as a physicist, because I don’t want to commit such
murderous acts again. And it was my foolishness...” Although what he
proposed was very intellectual, it was not intelligent: “Just the very
show of power is enough.”</p><p><br></p><p>But politicians are so hungry to show their power that without making
it actually felt by the whole world... They will not be able to restrain
themselves.</p><p><br></p><p>Have you seen two dogs fighting? Most probably they will bark at each
other, jump at each other, and you will see that there is going to be a
bloody fight – but nothing happens. They judge and see who is stronger,
and once it is accepted by both that one is stronger than the other,
there is no need to fight. Then one dog simply puts his tail down, gives
the signal: “Stop it. You are the winner, I am the defeated and we can
still be good friends.”</p><p>Dogs are more intelligent than politicians. This is an intelligent
way to see it – “What is the point now? It is so clear that I am weaker
than the other; what is the point in unnecessarily getting fractured
bones and blood? It can be decided just by shouting and jumping and
making the whole show: it is going to happen, now it is going to
happen...” But it never happens. One dog understands, and immediately he
drops his tail.</p><p><br></p><p>You must have seen that if you approach a house and the dog is not
aware whether you are a friend or a foe, he does both things: he barks
at you, and he goes on waving his tail. One never knows which way things
turn out – if it turns out to be a friend, barking will stop and he is
already waving his tail, “Welcome!” So he is just waiting,
intelligently, for the time when the owner of the house comes out. Then
he can see whether this man is friendly or not. Before that, he is doing
both things.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, dogs are not very intellectual, but they are intelligent. You
will find intelligence in all the animals.</p><p><br></p><p>Now they even say that intelligence is in the trees – and it has been
found in strange ways. Now, trees are not intellectuals. You don’t see
them going to school with books or going to the library. No intellectual
work is visible, but intelligence is there. It has been found that one
tree the scientists were studying... there was no water near the tree,
but there was a pipeline two hundred feet away. And the tree in some way
found out, and all its roots went in that direction – and it was a
pipeline; it was not that water was available.</p><p><br></p><p>But those roots tied themselves around the water pipe so tightly that
it broke, and they were getting a supply of water from two hundred feet
away. And the tree remained green and was giving flowers. And when the
scientists were digging, they were surprised: how did the tree roots
find out that they had to go towards the north and not towards the
south? They went right in the direction of the water, as if there was a
subtle intelligence, a sensitivity. And they broke the pipeline and they
managed to get the water which was not available from the earth.</p><p><br></p><p>And now they have found that trees and plants have intelligence in
many ways – such deep intelligence that perhaps we are far behind.</p><p><br></p><p>Certain instruments like cardiograms have been made, which are
attached to a tree. and a woodcutter is told to go and cut a branch from
the tree, and the woodcutter goes with his axe. As he is coming near the
tree, the cardiogram starts showing that the tree is trembling with
fear; the graph on the paper starts trembling. It had been going very
symmetrically... as the woodcutter comes closer, there is more
trembling, more ups and more downs – and the woodcutter has not cut the
tree yet.</p><p><br></p><p>It seems that the very idea in the mind of the wood-cutter is in some
way being read by the tree – a certain kind of telepathy, a certain kind
of thought reading. And they have tried sending another woodcutter – who
is not going to cut, he is told just to pass by the side of the tree
with his axe – and the cardiogram remains symmetrical. Because there is
no idea in the man to cut the tree; the tree is not worried, there is no
fear.</p><p><br></p><p>Our minds are broadcasting every moment whatsoever is in our minds.
Trees are getting it. Man seems to be dumb – you don’t know if somebody
is coming to kill you or pick your pocket – but the tree knows. A
different way of knowing must be...</p><p>The man who goes beyond mind is not crazy, but enters into a
different way of knowing, a different way of understanding the world, a
different way of responding to reality – more intelligently, more
sensitively, more lovingly, more humanely.</p><p><br></p><p>Kavish, don’t be worried about it. This is the first step, and this
is the right step. Question 2</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>I GOT THE POINT NOW THAT BEING TOTALLY IN THE HEART IS ONLY THE
BEGINNING, AND THAT THE JOURNEY IS NEVER-ENDING.</p><p><br></p><p>NOW SOMETIMES I FEEL THAT IN THE OLD POONA STORIES ENLIGHTENMENT WAS
MUCH EASIER THAN WHEN YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT IT NOW. IS IT BECAUSE WE
TOOK THE FIRST STEP, AND NOW YOU ARE SHOWING US THE NEXT ONE?</p><p><br></p><p>It is certain that in my earlier teachings to you, enlightenment
appeared to be much easier. It had to, because I did not want you to
freak out. Now I can trust that even if I say the truth you are not
going to escape. Enlightenment is not easy.</p><p><br></p><p>But how to persuade people? They are so much engaged in futile
things, and if you give them a very difficult idea, which becomes
prohibitive, they simply say, “We will see. Perhaps in some life some
time – and what is the hurry? Eternity is available. The small things
that we are engaged in doing right now will not be available for
eternity, so let us finish them first.”</p><p><br></p><p>And they will go on putting enlightenment as the last item on their
list.</p><p><br></p><p>There is an old, ancient story in India about Kind Yayati. His death
came; he was one hundred years old, he had done everything that you can
do – conquered lands, had beautiful wives, had one hundred sons from
those wives, had all the treasure that one can imagine. But man’s desire
is inexhaustible. He said to death, “It is too early; I have not yet
completed my experiences on the earth. You will have to give me at least
one hundred years more.”</p><p><br></p><p>Death said, “I can give you one hundred years on one condition: if
one of your sons is ready to die in your place. Because anyway I have to
take somebody, I cannot go empty-handed. Bureaucracy is bureaucracy,
nobody bothers there – just somebody’s body, and the register is marked
that ‘Yes, Yayati has died.’ So if one of your sons... and you have one
hundred sons...”</p><p><br></p><p>Yayati said, “There is no problem, my sons love me so much.”</p><p><br></p><p>He called his sons... and his sons were not children. Somebody was
eighty years old, somebody was seventy-five, somebody was seventy. They
themselves were old, but nobody was willing to die. Just the youngest
son, who was only seventeen, as yet unmarried, had just come from his
gurukula, from his master’s home – he came forward and he said, “You can
take me. If this can give my father one hundred years I will be
immensely happy.”</p><p>Even death felt tremendous compassion for the boy. Death said, “Can’t
you see your ninety-nine brothers? – nobody is willing. They are coming
close to their own death. There is not much to lose for the one who is
eighty years old – any day his own death is going to come. You are too
young, you don’t understand what you are doing. Think twice.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I have thought about it. Exactly the same reasons that you
are giving me... my father has lived one hundred years and is
unsatisfied; my ninety-nine brothers have lived and yet none is ready to
die. That is enough proof for me that in this life, satisfaction is not
possible. At least give me this satisfaction, that I have given to my
father what he has given to me; I give it back to him. It is useless,
life.”</p><p><br></p><p>Unwillingly, death had to take him away.</p><p><br></p><p>One hundred years passed and death was back, and Yayati said, “My
God, I forgot completely about the fact that after a hundred years you
would be back again. Everything is incomplete.”</p><p><br></p><p>And this went on happening. When Yayati became one thousand years
old... Ten times death came, and every time the youngest son sacrificed
himself for the father.</p><p><br></p><p>It has tremendous implications: The old mind is not ready to die;
even if you give it one thousand years to live, it clings to life. only
the youngest is bold enough to go into death without entering into the
ups and downs, days and nights, summers and winters of life.</p><p><br></p><p>But after one thousand years when death came, Yayati said, “This
time... things are still incomplete, but I have understood that they
will remain always incomplete. You can take me. And I am ashamed that I
did not understand at all. I have sacrificed my young sons – who were
innocent, but more intelligent; they had more insight. They could-see
that satisfaction, contentment, completion is not possible here in this
life.” – You are engaged in a thousand and one things, and you will have
to leave them all incomplete – houses half built, businesses half
successful lives... yet asking for a little more time. You will die like
a beggar, not like an emperor. You will not embrace death, you will be
dragged by death unwillingly, reluctantly.</p><p><br></p><p>Here, if I say to you enlightenment is very difficult, you will put
it down at the very bottom of your life. I have to say to people that it
is very easy, it is easier than anything else in the world, it is the
easiest thing. And once you have become interested in enlightenment
then, slowly slowly, I can tell you, “Don’t be stupid.” But I will say
it only when the time is ripe.</p><p><br></p><p>It is the greatest challenge to those who really want to understand
themselves and the existence surrounding them. However difficult it may
be, it will remain their priority. Everything else is secondary, because
nothing else is going to give you the taste of eternal life, of immortal
being, of peace that passeth understanding. Nothing else is going to
help you come out of the darkness in which you have lived for lives and
lives – groping, groaning.</p><p><br></p><p>It call bring you, in the darkest night of your life, the most
beautiful dawn.</p><p><br></p><p>It is difficult in the proportion in which you demand it: if it is
your first priority, it is not that difficult; if it is your last
priority, it is very difficult, almost impossible. But you have come a
long way, and even</p><p>if I say that it is a journey that never ends you can understand its
beauty – you are not going to be afraid of a journey that never
ends.</p><p><br></p><p>When for the first time railway trains started in London, the first
train was going for only eight miles. But all the churches, the bishops
and cardinals and the archbishop of England, were condemning the railway
train, saying that God never made the railway train; if it was needed
for human beings he would have made it himself. Such a clear-cut logic.
It is certainly the devil’s trick – and the train also looks like a
devil, particularly the old engines look like the devil. And they made
people afraid – “Don’t sit in it.”</p><p><br></p><p>There was no ticket, and lunch was served free. But the bishops were
saying to the people, “You don’t know one thing: it will start, but what
is the guarantee that it will stop? And if it does not stop, then what?
What will you do? Just one lunch – finish! Just for one lunch the whole
life is finished.”</p><p><br></p><p>And certainly nobody had seen a train stopping. Never had a train
started, never had a train stopped; there was no precedent. Nobody could
say with any guarantee that it would stop. Even the engineers, the
scientists, could not say it with a guarantee; they said, “We know it
will stop, but a guarantee? How can we give a guarantee? We have to
see.”</p><p><br></p><p>With great difficulty... Only a few people went, half a dozen in the
whole train, daredevils who said, “okay, if it doesn’t stop that will
do. If it is going to hell then we will go to hell – but we will see
what happens. But lunch we cannot... a free lunch we cannot pass
up.”</p><p><br></p><p>So only half a dozen... And people were trying, their families were
trying to convince them, “Come down, don’t go just for one lunch. Don’t
kill yourself! Can’t you see the face of the train?” But the train
stopped, and there was great rejoicing.</p><p><br></p><p>People are afraid of anything that is unending.</p><p><br></p><p>But those who know should be afraid of things which end. Unending
things should be the great attractions.</p><p><br></p><p>So now I can say you are on an unending journey, where you will have
overnight stops but you will never come to an end – no terminus, no
Victoria Station.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 3 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>I AM NOTICING THAT THE QUESTIONS YOU ARE ANSWERING ARE ANSWERING
MINE. BUT THE QUESTIONS I HAVE BEEN SUBMITTING ARE NOT AS ARTICULATE AND
SEEM TO BE LESS CLEAR THAN THOSE YOU ARE ANSWERING.</p><p><br></p><p>NOW IS THE TIME FOR US TO HAVE YOU ANSWER ALL OF OUR QUESTIONS.</p><p><br></p><p>WHAT SURPRISES AND SHOCKS ME IS THAT AT ONE TIME I CONSIDERED MYSELF
ARTICULATE. NOW MY QUESTIONS ARE LIKE FLAMES IN MY HEART – WORDLESS,
BEAUTIFUL, BURNING.</p><p>OSHO, CAN YOU SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THE NECESSITY FOR A DISCIPLE TO BE
ABLE TO ARTICULATE THE QUESTIONS THAT ARE BURNING WITHIN?</p><p><br></p><p>The disciple who has a burning question but is not articulate enough
to put it into words is blessed. It is not something that one should
feel sad about. It is something that should make one feel profoundly
fortunate because to have a question which you cannot bring into words
is to have a real question.</p><p><br></p><p>Real questions cannot be brought into words.</p><p><br></p><p>But real questions will be answered. Whether you can bring them into
words or not, it doesn’t matter.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, I am taking care of all those questions which are in your
hearts but cannot find a way into language. They are the most
important.</p><p><br></p><p>So whatever questions you ask me, I use them as an excuse to answer
many other questions which are not asked.</p><p><br></p><p>But remember: if you have a – question, it cannot remain unanswered.
I am here just for those questions.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 4 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>IN THE MAD GAME OF MASTER AND DISCIPLE, I REMEMBER HEARING YOU SAY IN
POONA THAT THE MASTER CHOOSES THE DISCIPLE FIRST – BEFORE THE DISCIPLE
FEELS THAT HE HAS CHOSEN THE MASTER.</p><p><br></p><p>OSHO, DOES THE MASTER LEAVE THE DISCIPLE BEFORE THE DISCIPLE CAN
BETRAY THE MASTER?</p><p><br></p><p>That’s true. The unconscious disciple has no choice, either in
choosing the master or leaving the master. It is only the conscious
master who chooses the disciple, and if he feels that it is not the
right time for the disciple, he drops him. But he drops him with such
grace that the disciple always thinks that he has dropped the
master.</p><p><br></p><p>While choosing also, the disciple thinks he has chosen the master. In
your sleep you cannot choose who is going to awaken you. In your sleep
you can only dream You cannot have any glimpse of reality on either end
– choosing a master or leaving a master.</p><p><br></p><p>The master chooses a disciple seeing some potential, some possibility
of flowering. But there are disciples whose pace of growth is so slow
that it may take lives for them; then it is better to leave them. Some
other gardener will work on them. It is better not to start working on
them, because leaving incomplete work is creating a difficulty for the
disciple.</p><p><br></p><p>The master is not going to come back again in the next life. If I
cannot complete your work in this life, I will not begin it. Then it is
better to leave you tabula rasa; somebody else somewhere in your future
life may do the work. He will have his own designs, he will have his own
devices.</p><p>Zunnun, one Sufi master, used to say to each new disciple that
arrived, “Have you ever been a disciple to another master? If you have,
then my fee will be double. If you have never been a disciple of any
other master then my usual fee will do.”</p><p><br></p><p>People were puzzled. They would say, “We thought that since we have
learned so much from other masters and now we have come to you... You
should not charge a double fee – you should charge half of the fee or no
fee at all.”</p><p><br></p><p>But Zunnun said, “You don’t understand: first I will have to undo
whatever the other masters have done, because our designs are different,
our devices are differ-ent, so my work is complicated. A person who
comes fresh is simpler to work with.”</p><p><br></p><p>So if I see-that a certain person is not going to develop, that
whatever is done he is going to waste time, he is not in an urgency –
and I am in an urgency – then it is better to say goodbye to him. But it
will be hard on him to make him feel that he has been left out. The
better way is to create a situation in which he himself leaves, feeling
perfectly good that he has left.</p><p><br></p><p>He is given a false opportunity to think that he has chosen the
master and he is given a false opportunity to feel that he has left the
master. But on both occasions it is the master who is basically
responsible.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 5 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>WHEREVER YOU ARE, THERE IS A FESTIVITY AND CELEBRATION. WHAT IS THIS
WONDERFUL PHENOMENON?</p><p><br></p><p>Narendra, festivity and celebration are our natural states; you have
just forgotten them.</p><p><br></p><p>When you come to me, you suddenly remember that there is no need to
be sad, no need to be miserable, that life wants you to sing and dance,
that life is not serious, but playfulness.</p><p><br></p><p>The ancient seers used to call it leela; that word can only be
translated as ‘playfulness’. It is God’s playfulness.</p><p>You just have to be reminded.</p><p><br></p><p>Anybody who knows it... being close to him, you see your face in his
mirror. And suddenly there is a remembrance, and your misery disappears
– because your misery is false, your sadness is false. Celebration is
your truth. It has nothing to do with me; it is just that in my presence
you forget for a moment your false mask of misery. Suddenly you-feel-a
joy, a cheerfulness, a fragrance arising in you. It is not mine.</p><p>I am just a reminder, just a mirror. Seeing your face, there is
celebration.</p><p>You cannot see your face without a mirror, that is a difficulty.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard that Mulla Nasruddin found a mirror on the road. He had
never seen a mirror – some traveler passing by the side of the village
may have dropped the mirror. He looked in the mirror and said, “My God,
this is my father! And this old cheat used to have a photograph of
himself and we never knew about it.”</p><p><br></p><p>He took the mirror home. He did not want to show it to his wife
because an unnecessary quarrel would arise – any point was enough – so
he went upstairs. The wife was looking out of the corner of her eye...
“That old fellow is certainly doing something, the way he has entered.”
And as he left the house, she went upstairs. He had hidden it inside a
box underneath his clothes, but she found it. No husband can hide
anything which the wife cannot find, it has never happened.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked into the mirror and she said, “My God, in this old age...
and he is having a love affair. And with this old woman, rotten!”</p><p><br></p><p>It is the mirror.</p><p><br></p><p>Without the mirror you would not have been able to know how you look.
The mirror is certainly a great invention.</p><p>The master is also a mirror – not for this body and this face, but
for your original face, for your real being, for your inner flame. And
the moment you see it, suddenly you feel all darkness, all misery, all
sadness gone, and there is celebration.</p><p><br></p><p>Wherever the master is, there is Kaaba, there is Kashi, because there
is a possibility to experience your authentic blissfulness.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly a song, a dance – you are no more your old self. At least
for the moment you are a new being.</p><p>And if you go on remembering this, then the need of the master is
not. Whenever you remember yourself there will be celebration, there
will be Kaaba, there will be Kashi.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part29>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

I WAS SO CONFUSED ABOUT IT, AND I DIDN’T TRUST TELLING ANY SANNYASIN. I READ THAT YOU SAID IN POONA THAT WE ARE ALL ILL UNTIL WE ARE ENLIGHTENED.\nCAN YOU TALK MORE ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MASTER AND DISCIPLE, BETWEEN DOCTOR AND PATIENT?\nJean-Luc, the confusion is an indication of what I call sickness. Clarity is health.\nHave you ever heard of any madman recognizing that he is mad? If he recognizes it, that will be the beginning of sanity. But no madman ever recognizes that he is mad.\nI am reminded of a few cases.…\nWhen Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru was prime minister of India, there were at least one dozen people in the madhouses of India who thought they were the real Jawaharlal Nehru, and some phony man\nwas ruling the country while they had been forced into the madhouse so that they could not expose the phoniness of the man who had become the prime minister.\nIn Bareilly, India has its biggest madhouse... and Jawaharlal was going to Bareilly. One madman was thought by the doctors to be cured; they thought it would be great – Jawaharlal was going to visit the madhouse and this madman could be released from the madhouse by Jawaharlal himself. This man would rejoice, and it would enhance the prestige of the institution too.\nThe madman was brought to Jawaharlal. The first question he asked was “Who are you?” The doctors were a little nervous. This is not the way to talk to the prime minister of the country.\nBut Jawaharlal said, “My name is Jawaharlal Nehru.”\nAnd the madman had a good laugh. He said, “Don’t be worried. Just three years it will take, and you will be cured just as I am cured. These doctors are great. When I came to this place, I used to think in the same way – that I am Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru. Now you have come –\nstrange coincidence, that I am going out and you are coming in.”\nIt has been happening in many instances throughout the world. During the second world war, Winston Churchill had gone for an evening walk. There used to be a certain fixed time that a horn would go off around the city. Everybody had to go inside the house, lights had to be dimmed, curtains had to be drawn. It was as if London had disappeared. But walking, and worried about the war, Winston Churchill forgot about the time and when he heard the horn he was miles away from his house. And it was a standing order that if anybody was found on the road after the horn stopped he could be shot, no questions would be asked. In a hurry, he knocked at the first door – it was a question of life and death – and a man opened the door. The man said, “Who are you?”\nHe said, “You don’t know me? I am Winston Churchill, prime minister of this country, and you don’t know me?” And that man grabbed Churchill; Churchill said, “What are you doing?”\nHe said, “Come in, because there are three more Winston Churchills here – this is a madhouse. Now all four of you decide who is the real one.”\nChurchill told him, “Listen, I am telling you the truth. I am the real one.”\nHe said, “They all say the same thing, everybody is the real one. And we don’t know any criteria to judge – they are all fat like you, they all smoke cigars. They have been practicing being Winston Churchill for years. When you see them, you yourself will understand that you are not real; they are real.”\nChurchill said, “My God, I have knocked on the wrong door.”\nBut the man was not going to let him go. He said, “Outside is death, inside you can wait. In the morning we will figure out who is the real one.”\nAnd when he saw the three others, he himself had doubts about whether he was the real one or these fellows were. They had the same kind of clothes, cigars of the same type. He introduced himself – “I am Winston Churchill.”\nAll three of them laughed. They said, “This is strange, now there are four. This country is going down the drain, all the prime ministers are inside the madhouse. At least one must be real.”\nWinston Churchill tried, “Can I phone?”\nHe was refused. “That’s what they all ask: ‘Can we phone our secretaries, our ministries, cabinet people?’ This is not allowed. Anything that you want to do, you can do in the morning. If you are really Winston Churchill, they will come. For these three nobody has ever turned up, now we have to wait for you. Just don’t get mixed up.”\nNo madman is ready to accept that he is mad.\nJean-Luc, what is your fear in becoming a sannyasin – because I have said that unless a man becomes enlightened he is not truly healthy because he is not truly whole; he is a confusion? I am not talking about ordinary illnesses. I am talking about the fundamental sickness of the soul, that you have forgotten yourself and you have become identified with things which you are not.\nA few years ago it happened in America: they celebrated Abraham Lincoln’s birthday on a large scale, for one whole year. A special drama was prepared about the life of Abraham Lincoln, and the whole of America was searched to find a man who looked like him. And they did find one man who looked like Abraham Lincoln; he was chosen. For one year he was using exactly the same clothes as Abraham Lincoln, speaking in the same way, walking in the same way. He was trained, because he would be going around the country with the drama for the whole year.\nAbraham Lincoln stuttered a little, so he was taught to stutter. He was also a little lame – walking, one of his legs was a little longer than the other. So great massage, traction was done on the poor man to make one leg a little longer. Obviously he started walking like a lame man, stuttering. Experts in voice training trained him to speak with exactly the voice of Abraham Lincoln. He was made into an exact carbon copy. And for one year continually, every night, he was performing. People loved him, loved his acting, loved it that even Abraham Lincoln could not do better.\nWhen the year was finished he came home walking like Abraham Lincoln, lame, stuttering. At first the family thought he was joking, but he was not joking; it had become fixed in his mind that he WAS Abraham Lincoln. He used the same dress, which was no longer in fashion, and urchins would follow him on the street shouting, “Abraham Lincoln is coming!”\nHe was taken to a psychoanalyst. He entered his office... but it was no longer a part, it was no longer acting. He was so identified that he told the psychoanalyst, “You should be respectful to the president of the country.” The psychoanalyst gave him many sessions, but even in the sessions he was stuttering – and he had never stuttered in his whole life. The voice and everything that he had learned and practiced, and for one year continually had to do.…\nFinally the psychoanalyst called his family and said, “This man cannot be cured, because it is not an illness. He has taken a new identity, and unless he is shot just like Abraham Lincoln he is not going to listen to anybody else. But shooting this poor man will not be a cure; he will be finished, and he will die like Abraham Lincoln. That will be really the proof that what he is saying is absolutely right.”\nYour confusion is your sickness.\nYour mind is your sickness.\nComing to a state of no-mind is health, wholeness.\nThat is what is meant by enlightenment. You are no more identified with the body. Have you ever thought for a single moment... you were a child, you became a young man, you became old – which body is yours? And the first day, when your mother got pregnant, on that day also you had a body. If the picture is shown to you, it will be simply a picture of a small egg – are you going to say that this is Jean-Luc?\nAnd if it is not Jean-Luc, then you cannot be Jean-Luc either because that small egg is the beginning, and then for nine months in the mother’s womb you have passed through all the stages humanity has passed through its evolution. First you have been a fish; that’s what has given the idea to the scientists that life was born in the ocean. But scientists have come to this conclusion only just now. In India, for almost ten thousand years the idea has been prevalent that the first incarnation of God was a fish, matsyavatar.\nStrange that God should choose a fish to be his first incarnation – but ‘God’ simply means life and nothing else; it is just that one is a religious term, the other is a biological term. The scientists would say that life was born in the ocean, but they both agree that the first manifestation of life was that of a fish. And Charles Darwin came with the idea of a monkey but in India, for centuries we have worshipped the monkey-god Hanuman with great respect, because he is our forefather. Now scientists are agreeing, because the last stage in the mother’s womb is that of a monkey – the child looks like a monkey.\nIf all the photographs from the day you become part of your mother’s womb to the day you come out of the womb are presented to you, you will not be able to recognize any of them as your picture, that it is your album.\nEven after birth, if detailed pictures are being kept from his childhood up to the age of seventy, a person will not be able to recognize that at some time, some day he has been identified with all these bodies. He is still there, those bodies are gone.\nMan is not a body. Man is not a mind either. A Hindu has a Hindu mind, a Christian has a Christian mind, a Buddhist has a Buddhist mind. Mind is given to you by the society. What you bring with you is only a brain, and that brain is a tabula rasa, nothing is written on it. You can write Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, communism, or any nonsense. And you are not left in freedom to choose what you would like to be written on your brain. Before you are aware, the society has already filled your mind completely with all kinds of superstitions. You are not a Hindu.…\nIt was always a problem whenever there was census in this country. The officers would come to me with their forms, and in their forms it was to be filled in to what religion I belonged. And I said, “I don’t belong to any religion.”\nThey said, “Then you have to write that you are an atheist.”\nI said, “I don’t belong to atheism either, because if there is no God I am not going to waste my time in denying something which does not exist. A few are worshipping him, a few are denying him – and he does not exist at all. No, I am not an atheist.”\nBut they would say, “This is not right, the form has to be filled in completely.”\nI said, “I am not here to fill in the form. You can take the form incomplete – and anyway I am not going to vote, because it is so difficult to choose which idiot to vote for. I have never voted in my life.”\nThey would take their registers and run away, and they would look again and again at me – “This man seems to be dangerous. He will not fill in the form, and now he says ‘I cannot vote because the problem is how to decide which idiot is less idiotic, it is a very difficult psychological problem. You just take your registers and your forms. I am just myself.’”\nYou are not the body, you are not the mind – these are your sicknesses, your false identities. Enlightenment simply means coming home, coming to the center which you are.\nWhy are you afraid to tell others that you want to become a sannyasin, that you have filled in the form to become a sannyasin? – because they will think you are sick. But the whole of humanity is sick.\nThey will not laugh at you. They will appreciate your courage, that you have accepted your sickness. This is the beginning of dissolving it.\nThe most difficult thing is when a person does not accept his sickness; then you cannot help him. He will throw away the medicine, he will shut the door in the face of the doctor.\nI have heard that Mulla Nasruddin became old, very old – and as people become old they become troublesome, they become more and more a nuisance. Children are a nuisance, but nothing compared to old people, because old people have experience – their nuisance is supported by their experience, reason, logic; they have known the world. They will not let anybody live in peace.\nAnd as people become older they cannot sleep, because the function of sleep is no more there. The child sleeps in the mother’s womb for twenty-four hours a day, because he is growing so much that if he is awake it will be a disturbance to his growth. Nature does not allow him to be awake, but keeps him in a kind of anesthesia, fast asleep so he can grow. Scientists say that in these nine months a child grows as much as he will never grow again. In seventy years of life, he will never again grow with such speed.\nAfter the birth, sleep starts being cut. Then the child is sleeping twenty-two hours, then twenty hours, then eighteen, then sixteen, then fourteen.And then by the age of fourteen he comes to\nthe average of eight hours. But as he goes beyond fifty, again less sleep – because now he has to prepare for death. In the mother’s womb he was preparing for life; his body was growing, his brain was growing. It was a subtle process, a delicate process; it needed complete silence. Now everything is dying.so beyond sixty, people start becoming senile. Then they go on believing in\ntheir old memories, their golden days – the future is dark. By the time they reach seventy, two hours of sleep is enough.\nMulla Nasruddin had reached ninety years. Now he needed no sleep! It would be okay if he kept quiet but he would not. He would wake up everybody, start giving sermons and great advice to everybody. And they told him, “In the day you can do everything.”\nHe said, “In the day you have to do other kinds of work, you have to live life. In the night you are all at home, and there is nothing to do.” So he would gather everybody, wake everybody up and start giving great sermons which were all nonsense. But he was the oldest man in the town, the most respected – what to do with him?\nHis sons, his grandsons were all in agony: “Every night the house becomes a church. Somehow we have to find somebody who can make him sleep.” Many kinds of doctors were tried – allopathic, ayurvedic, homeopathic, naturopathic, yunani; nobody succeeded. Finally they got hold of a hypnotist who said, “Don’t be worried. This is my business, to put people to sleep.”\nNasruddin heard that they were going to bring a hypnotist. He said, “Okay, let him come.”\nThe hypnotist came with his bag. Nasruddin was lying down on the bed. And the hypnotist said, “Listen, it is very easy to sleep. Just relax. I will give suggestions and you have simply to follow. First I will give suggestions to relax the body, each part of the body, so no tension remains. Then I will suggest that you are falling into sleep... deeper, deeper, deeper. Don’t resist.”\nNasruddin followed. His family was surprised, because he was not a man to listen to anybody – perhaps the hypnotist had some power. And he started giving him suggestions. Nasruddin relaxed, and the whole family was very happy; they could see his whole body completely relaxed. And then suggestions for sleep... and even the hypnotist was surprised, because he was not only sleeping, he was snoring. The family was very thankful. His fee was ten rupees, but they gave him twenty rupees and they said, “You are the only one who has been successful.”\nAnd as they went out to take him to his car and came back in, Nasruddin opened one eye and asked, “Has that nut gone or not? Now everybody gather, and the sermon begins: You idiots, you should have given me twenty rupees and I would have been silent the whole night. Just give me twenty rupees each night and I will be silent. Don’t waste money this way. Rather than talking business to me, you are bringing these idiots. I befooled him within seconds – and he believed even the snoring. Who has ever heard that in hypnosis people snore? He does not know even the ABC of hypnosis.”\nEverybody is in confusion, young or old. Sick, sick unto death, but nobody is willing to accept it. On the contrary, he is throwing out the doctors, proving that “I am not sick.”\nAccepting your sickness is the beginning of gaining health. So don’t be worried; tell sannyasins that you are joining them on the path. They will not laugh at you.\nAnd it is not a question of one person; the whole world is in the same situation. Only once in a while a person becomes enlightened. It should not be so, but unfortunately this is the case. Everybody has the potential to be enlightened – but the very first step and you don’t have guts to say that “I am sick, sick of the mind, confused, split, schizophrenic. One moment I am feeling good, another moment I am feeling bad, and I don’t know who I am, still I go on dragging. I don’t know anything of reality, still I have beliefs about everything. All my knowledge is just a burden. My reality is that of a patient.”\nAnd you have put it rightly. What is the relationship between the master and the disciple? – exactly the same as that of the physician and the patient.\nI will tell you a small story.\nGautam Buddha came into a town. That town had a blind man who was a great logician, very rational, and the whole town had tried to tell him that light exists, but nobody could prove it.\nThere is no way to prove light. Either you can see it or you cannot see it, but there is no other proof.\nThe blind man said, “I am ready. I can touch things and I can feel them with my hands. You bring your light and I would like to touch it and feel it.”\nBut light is not something tangible. They said, “No, it cannot be touched or felt.”\nHe said, “I have other ways. I can smell it, I can taste it. I can beat it and hear the sound. But these are my only instruments – my ears, my nose, my tongue, my hands – I am making available to you my whole personality. Should I listen to my own personality, or should I listen to you? I say there is no light; it is simply an invention, an invention of cunning people to deceive simple people like me so that you can prove that I am blind and you have eyes. The whole strategy is that you are not interested in light, you are interested in proving that you have eyes and I don’t have eyes. You want to be higher, superior. Because you cannot be logically, rationally superior to me you have brought in something absurd. Forget all about it, you are all blind. Nobody has seen light because light does not exist.”\nWhen they heard that Buddha had come to the town, the people said, “It is a good opportunity. We should take our logician the blind man to Gautam Buddha; perhaps he can convince him – and we cannot find a better man.”\nThey brought the blind man to Gautam Buddha. They told the whole story that was going on: one blind man was proving them all blind, was proving that there is no light, and they were absolutely incapable of proving the existence of light.\nThe words of Gautam Buddha are worth remembering. He said, “You have brought him to the wrong person. He does not need a philosopher, he needs a physician. It is not a question of convincing him, it is a question of curing his eyes. But don’t be worried, I have my personal physician with me.” One of the emperors of those days had given his own personal physician to Gautam Buddha to take care of him twenty-four hours a day, to be with him like a shadow.\nHe asked the physician, “You take care of this man’s eyes.”\nThe physician looked at the man’s eyes and he said, “It is not a difficult case; just a certain growth is covering his eyes, which can be removed. It may take at the most six months.”\nBuddha left his physician in the village, and after six months the man opened his eyes. All his logic, all his rationality disappeared. He said, “My God, I was telling those simple people that they were cheating me, deceiving me. Light exists – I was blind! Had I accepted the idea of my blindness before, there would have been no need for me to live my whole life in blindness.”\nBuddha had gone far away in six months, but the man came dancing, fell at Buddha’s feet and said to him, “Your compassion is great that you did not argue with me, that you did not try to convince me about the light but gave me a physician.”\nBuddha said, “This is my whole work. There are spiritually blind people all around. And my work is not to convince them about the beauty, the blissfulness, the ecstasy of existence; my work is that of a physician.”\nAnd that is the relationship between a master and a disciple. The disciple comes, openly accepting that “I am sick, I need your help. I am blind, I need my eyes to be cured. I want to see what you have seen. I want to be what you have become.”\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nHOW CAN I BECOME A DISCIPLE?\nWhat is the need to become a disciple? Why should you ask such a question?\nDo you feel your life is meaningless, that you need some meaning? Do you feel your life is empty and you would like fulfillment? Do you feel you are in darkness and you would like to be in the light?\nThe whole thing depends on you.\nIf you are contented as you are, if you are not missing anything as you are, there is no need to be a disciple. Why bother a master, and why go into an unnecessary search? But if you have emptiness, meaninglessness, anxiety, anguish, confusion, darkness; if you feel your whole life is nothing but misery, then to become a disciple is very simple.\nIt simply means to contact someone who is fulfilled, who has no questions left, who is only an answer.\nThe disciple is a question. The master is an answer.\nAnd as far as I am concerned, there are no conditions on the disciple. Nothing is imposed on the disciple; on the contrary, he is helped to drop unnecessary luggage and be as light as possible.\nJust be receptive to someone whom you feel is not miserable, whom you feel lives in ecstasy, radiates blissfulness, in whose presence you feel a silence descending on you. Then open your heart to him. You have nothing to lose except your miseries.\nKarl Marx ends his COMMUNIST MANIFESTO with a tremendously important message, although in a different context – but it is as useful to the disciple as he thought it was useful to the proletariat. He says, “Proletarians of the whole world, unite! And don’t be afraid because you have nothing to lose except your chains.” It may not be correct in the context in which he was talking – because communist revolutions have happened; chains have changed, freedom has not come. First there used to be bourgeois chains, now there are communist chains – which are more up to date, stronger, more difficult to get rid of.\nBut in the context in which I am quoting it, it is tremendously beautiful: a disciple has nothing to lose except his misery. Because you don’t have anything other than misery, but you go on hiding your misery as if you have a treasure.\nAnd you are asking how to be a disciple.\nJust drop your misery at somebody’s feet in whose eyes you see some rays going beyond darkness, indicating a path to blissfulness and benediction.\nQuestion 3 BELOVED OSHO,\nFOR MORE THAN TEN YEARS I HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING YOU FROM PLACE TO PLACE. I CAN’T BELIEVE THAT I AM BACK IN INDIA. AM I BRAINWASHED, ADDICTED, OR WHAT?\nYou are certainly brainwashed.\nI use a dry cleaning machine, I am not old-fashioned. And naturally you are addicted. Who will not be?\nAddiction is not always bad. If you are addicted to beauty, to poetry, to drama, to sculpture, to painting, nobody tells you to drop the addiction. Addiction has to be dropped only when it makes you unconscious. Alcoholics are told to drop the addiction, but here my teaching is of consciousness – be addicted to it more and more.\nAnd what is wrong in being brainwashed? – wash it every day, keep it clean. Do you like cockroaches? When I brainwash people, I find cockroaches. Cockroaches are very special animals. It has been found scientifically that wherever you find man you find cockroaches, and wherever you find cockroaches you find man. They are always together, they are the oldest companions.\nWhat have you got in your brain? So just washing it is perfectly right. But people have given it a very wrong connotation; those are the wrong people.\nChristians are afraid of somebody brainwashing Christians, because then they will not be Christians. Hindus are afraid because then those people will not be Hindus. Mohammedans are afraid, communists are afraid.\nEverybody is afraid of brainwashing. I am in absolute favor of it.\nThere used to be an old saying: “Cleanliness is next to God.” Now there is no God, so there is only cleanliness left.\nCleanliness is God.\nAnd I am not afraid of brainwashing because I am not putting cockroaches in your mind. I am giving you an opportunity to experience a clean mind, and once you know a clean mind you will never allow anybody to throw rubbish and crap into your mind. They are the criminals.\nBrainwashing is not a crime – who has made it dirty? Dirtying other people’s minds is a crime, but all over the world all the religions, all the political leaders, are using your mind as if it is a toilet. These ugly fellows have condemned brainwashing; otherwise, brainwashing is a perfectly good job.\nI am a brainwasher.\nAnd those who come to me should come with the clear conception that they are going to a man who is bound to brainwash, clean their minds of all kinds of cockroaches. Hindu, Mohammedan, Christian – they are all against me for the simple reason that they go on putting in their cockroaches, and I go on washing people’s minds.\nIt is just an up-to-date religious laundry. Question 4\nBELOVED OSHO,\nI EXPERIENCED SO MUCH ENERGY, INSIGHT AND EXPANDED AWARENESS WHEN I WAS A PATIENT OF RAJEN, TEERTHA, AMITABH AND SOMENDRA.\nNOW, EACH OF THEIR REACTIONS TO YOUR COMMENTS SEEM FULL OF THE EGO PROBLEMS THEY EACH POINTED OUT IN ME. IT IS AS IF EACH OF THEM SAW THEIR OWN PROBLEM IN ME, AND I ACCEPTED IT AS A CORRECT INSIGHT INTO MYSELF.\nHOW CAN SUCH BEAUTIFUL MEN, WHO APPEARED TO BE SO FULL OF YOUR GRACE AND SO DEVOTED TO SANNYAS, ALSO BE SO DUMB?\nBodhicitta, it is a simple phenomenon.\nThe people who had allowed me their total receptivity had become my messengers, but their function was not more than that of a postman. When you receive a love letter, don’t start kissing the postman!\nBut Bodhicitta himself is a psychoanalyst and he has developed a few techniques of his own, which may look stupid to you, but in America stupidity and spirituality are synonymous.\nFor example, Bodhicitta has developed a psychological technique called ‘hugging’; so the whole group of twenty or thirty people just go on hugging each other. It is good exercise, particularly in cold countries, but don’t try anything like that here in Bombay. In Bombay only enlightened people can hug each other, and it is very rare to find two enlightened people.\nYou had seen those therapists who were working in the commune in Poona under me – and they were going around the world, because I was not going anywhere. I had prepared them to be just a passage; that’s why you felt that they were so innocent, such beautiful people.\nAnd what has happened to them now? Just something natural.\nThere is a story: In Jagannathpuri every year the chariot of Jagannath, the lord of the world, goes around the city. Millions of people gather to see it.\nOnce it happened, a dog was moving ahead of the chariot and everybody was falling, kissing the earth – and the dog was puffed up; he thought, “My God, I never thought that I am Jagannath, the lord of the world. Millions of people have come, and they are all bowing down to me.”\nThe poor dog was not logically wrong; it was happening. He was not aware that they were touching the earth, doing their deep, respectful bowing down to the Jagannath in the chariot. All that he could see was that they were doing it to him.\nThe therapists who went around the world found sannyasins everywhere receiving them with as much love and respect as if I had come there. They had come as my representatives, they were sent by me. But what happened to those poor fellows? They started thinking that all this respect, all this love was for them. So when the commune was destroyed by the American government and there was a chaos, those few therapists started behaving as if they were enlightened, calling themselves enlightened.\nI have received hundreds of letters saying that, “Osho, we don’t find the same quality in these people as we used to find before. They are the same people, but Your presence is no more with them.”\nEven the participants in their groups have written to me, “Groups are the same, techniques are the same, but You are not there. And now we know that the miracle was not the technique but Your presence.” Their groups are being deserted now; soon they will not find a single sannyasin going to them.\nAnd if they have a little bit of intelligence, they will come back with a deep apology. They have betrayed. They were only mediums, they are not enlightened.\nAnd this is the difference: You can know a technique – but just to know a technique is one thing, to be a master is totally different. That is the difference between a scientist and a technologist. The scientist himself discovers – it is his own discovery, it is his own authority. The technologist simply imitates. He can do perfectly well as far as the objective world is concerned, but as far as the subjective world is concerned it is not possible.\nOnly the master can bring the transformation. The mediums can simply spread his word. The moment they start thinking that the respect and the honor is being given to them, they are no longer mediums. Then a dead technique is in their hands, which is not going to help.\nIt happened in Rome – each year there used to be a great competition of paintings. One year a painting was chosen, but one painter stood up and said, “There is something incomplete in it, it is not perfect. Whoever has done it is a technician but not a painter.”\nHe was asked, “Can you make it perfect?”\nHe came...”Yes, not much is missing, but what is missing is the very soul.” And he simply touched the lips of the painting with his brush. It had been looking sad and now it was smiling. And he said, “Now it is perfect. Whoever has done it should be given the award, but he is only a technician – a perfect technician – but he is not a master, because this smile is the soul of the whole painting.” And because of that smile the whole painting was changed, the whole context was different.\nOne man in America purchased one of Picasso’s paintings for one million dollars, but he was suspicious about whether it was an original or not – because there are so many technicians who are copying great paintings with such perfection that it is impossible to make a distinction unless you are an expert. He took the painting to one of the greatest critics, and the critic said, “You need not be worried about this painting. This painting Picasso has done in front of me, I was staying with him.”\nBut doubt is such a thing... it does not leave so easily.\nThe American then said, “I will pay the fare and whatever expenses. You come with me to Paris, and we have to ask Picasso himself – and you be present. I want to be absolutely certain that it is a Picasso.”\nHe said, “It is absolutely certain, you are unnecessarily wasting money. But there is no question, I am ready.”\nThey reached Paris and they went to see Picasso. The painting was shown to him and the man asked, “Is it an original Picasso?”\nAnd Picasso said, “No.”\nThe critic said, “Are you mad? Have you forgotten that I was staying with you at the time you were painting this?”\nPicasso said, “No, I have not forgotten that. You were staying here when I was painting this, but it is not an original.”\nThe critic said, “What do you mean it is not an original? You painted it!”\nHe said, “You have to understand my definition of originality. I had painted the same painting before. And there was no new idea coming to my mind, so I repainted it. It was only a technical job, there was no mastery – any technician could have done it. Does it matter that the technician is Picasso himself? It is not an original painting, it is a copy. And if you don’t believe me you can go to the museum where the original is hanging.”\nThey went and they could not make out any difference between the two. But one was an original idea and the other was only a carbon copy, done by the same man.\nBodhicitta, the therapists who are behaving in an utterly stupid way will have to return, because whoever has been with me cannot become a part of the world again. And once the sannyasins desert them – they are deserting them – those therapists will find that their idea that the respect was given to them was wrong. But they have to learn it the hard way.\nYou are fortunate. You go on doing your hugging meditation – in America; don’t mention it in India. It works in America, because for hundreds of years Christianity has made people so conditioned, that even to touch somebody is a sin. If you see a beautiful woman and you want just to touch her face because it is so beautiful, you will find yourself in the police station. And you were not asking anything; you would have touched her face, thanked the woman – and her husband – and gone your way. And the husband should be proud that he has such a wife that wherever he goes people come to touch her face.\nChristianity has made touching a sin. People have to be separate, particularly men and woman have to be separate. Even in the church they have to be separate, in the synagogue they have to be separate.\nSo your idea is perfectly good – but in a cold country, where people are not perspiring. Let them do as much hugging as they want and they will feel great. Because touching each other’s body is touching each other’s energy, and if it is a group where friends are together it becomes a loving phenomenon. There is no harm in it.\nBut don’t mention such a thing here.\nHe has opened an institute in Nepal. I was worried about him; this kind of psychotherapy in Nepal or India is not needed. California.If you have got a crazy idea simply go to California – any crazy\nidea and you will find followers, ready-made followers who were just waiting for some crazy idiot to come. And now you have been in the East long enough; you will get a good following in California.\nBut don’t be worried about these therapists. They will disappear just like soap bubbles because there is no reality, of enlightenment.\nQuestion 5 BELOVED OSHO,\nI HEARD YOU ONCE COMPARE THE WORK OF A MASTER TO THAT OF A SURGEON. IN THESE TERMS, BEING WITH YOU AS YOUR DISCIPLE, I HAVE EXPERIENCED YOU CUTTING VERY THOROUGHLY THROUGH WHATEVER MY MASKS ARE.\nHOW CAN YOU ACTUALLY DO NOTHING, AND YET GIVE ME SUCH AN INDIVIDUAL SURGICAL TREATMENT?\n‘Nothing’ is my sword; it is so thin you cannot see it.\nAnd the work is certainly so delicate, it cannot be done with crude instruments. Do you see the sword of ‘nothing’ in my hands?\nIt is there. Question 6\nBELOVED OSHO,\nHOW MUCH LONGER WILL I HAVE TO RUN AFTER YOU?\nIt depends on you.\nYou can run by my side or you can even run ahead of me, but just don’t run away. Question 7\nBELOVED MASTER,\nLIVING IN THE MOMENT, MY MEMORY BECOMES WORSE AND WORSE. DOING NOTHING, MY BODY AND MIND ARE GETTING MORE AND MORE LAZY. CLOSING MY EYES, I SEE NOTHING BUT DARKNESS.\nALL IN ALL, I ENJOY THIS, AND FEEL CONTENTED AND THANKFUL, BUT ONE QUESTION DISTURBS ME: HOW CAN I KNOW THAT THIS IS NOT THE CONTENTMENT OF A DONKEY?\nNiskriya – it is really the work of a donkey, but you are not an ordinary donkey. You are a German donkey!\nWhat do you call a donkey in German – esel. You are an esel.\nBut German donkeys have always done great things – two world wars, and without them the third is impossible. There are donkeys in every country but nobody can compete with a German donkey. There are Indian donkeys – you cannot tell them “Sitting silently, doing nothing” because that’s what they have been doing for centuries, and the grass has not grown yet!\nFor the grass to grow, a German donkey is needed. Because for the Indian donkey it is simply natural, there is nothing special in it; for the German donkey, sitting silently doing nothing seems to be impossible. And because it seems impossible, if he can manage it, the grass will have to grow. So Niskriya, don’t be worried. Be at ease.\nAnd donkeys are not bad people... very philosophical.\nIt is not a coincidence that Germany has produced the greatest philosophers in the world. Donkeys are philosophical, they are continuously thinking. Just watch a donkey. You will never find a donkey UNthinking.\nBut the poor donkey has been condemned almost all over the world for the simple reason that he does not write scriptures, does not give sermons, does not get crucified. He is so utterly simple and lives so silently – as if he is not. In this whole world, so much is going on, but for the donkeys nothing is going on; they live in a timeless moment.\nSo Niskriya, when I say you are a donkey, don’t feel bad about it. Sitting in your room, just think of yourself as esel, and enjoy it. It is far better than insane human beings, far better than all kinds of\nsick souls. Have you ever heard of any donkey going mad, or any donkey going to a psychiatrist, or any donkey committing suicide, or any donkey committing a murder, or any donkey committing a rape? Such innocent people... I support them perfectly. So remember, even if the world condemns them, I am here in total support. Relax, however difficult it is.\nBut if a German decides to relax, he will relax. An Indian decides many times to relax, but he never relaxes.\nI used to stay in a very rich man’s house in Calcutta. His name was Sohanlal Dugad. He was a man of seventy-five or eighty years of age, but he loved me very much and he had taken a promise that I would not stay anywhere else as long as he was alive. I had with me a friend who was a fanatic religious type. He was a celibate, and he was trying to renounce the world and become a monk. And in the night when we were sitting and gossiping, Sohanlal Dugad said, “In my life I have taken three times the vow of brahmacharya, of celibacy.” My friend was very much impressed.\nI said, “You idiot. For brahmacharya, for celibacy, one needs to take the vow only one time. Three times?”\nHe said, “I never thought about it. Yes, that is correct. We should ask what happened with the fourth time!”\nI said, “That is an embarrassing question to ask an old man. He himself would have said that after the third time he recognized the fact that it was beyond his capacity. It is better not to bother about it.” But he insisted.\nNext morning he asked him, and the old man said, “The fourth time? Don’t you think three times is enough? For a fourth time I could not gather the courage – three times failing.”\nThe Indian decides to meditate, to relax, to become a sannyasin. But he is always having good thoughts.…\nYou are fortunate, Niskriya, that you are German. If you decide to relax, it can be depended upon, reliable – and it will not disturb your work, I know.\nHe is a master of his work, he is a great filmmaker in Germany but he decided to close the whole business and just follow me. You might not understand that he has closed a big flourishing business; he was earning immense money, and now he simply takes my pictures and nothing else. This decisiveness is of tremendous value. This decisiveness gives you a spine.\nAnd you must see his work, with what concentration he looks after every minute detail. It takes him four hours every day to set up his camera here, and he must be thinking continually about how to improve – because I go on seeing new improvementsthese new umbrellas have appeared!\nSo many people have been making the films, and they all have been harming my eyes. He is the first man who has thought about my eyes first. That’s why these umbrellasmy eyes are not affected at\nall.\nBut such minute concern, and a decisiveness to do something to its perfection – the same thing can be turned into any dimension. If it becomes spirituality, it will be the same – the same quality, the same determination, the same devotion.\nSo if you are feeling relaxed, it is not against action. One has to understand that relaxation is the very source of energy; it can be converted into action. In the night you go to sleep so that in the morning you are rejuvenated. The night has not been a wastage, the night has helped you to recover the energy that you have used before. Again you are young, again fresh.\nIn meditation, whatever happens is bound to be expressed in creativity. What you are doing is a creative act, and for your creative act you have renounced everything. For your love you have renounced everything. It will be appreciated by people when they come to know of it.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"7591","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_osho_upanishad/part23/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_osho_upanishad/>The Osho Upanishad</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">23 \`Nothing\' is my sword</h1><div class=post-meta>36 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;7591 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Osho_Upanishad/part23.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part22>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

THINKING THAT TAKING SANNYAS WAS RECOGNIZING THAT ONE IS ILL. I WAS SO
CONFUSED ABOUT IT, AND I DIDN’T TRUST TELLING ANY SANNYASIN. I READ THAT
YOU SAID IN POONA THAT WE ARE ALL ILL UNTIL WE ARE ENLIGHTENED.</p><p><br></p><p>CAN YOU TALK MORE ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MASTER AND DISCIPLE,
BETWEEN DOCTOR AND PATIENT?</p><p><br></p><p>Jean-Luc, the confusion is an indication of what I call sickness.
Clarity is health.</p><p>Have you ever heard of any madman recognizing that he is mad? If he
recognizes it, that will be the beginning of sanity. But no madman ever
recognizes that he is mad.</p><p><br></p><p>I am reminded of a few cases.…</p><p><br></p><p>When Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru was prime minister of India, there were
at least one dozen people in the madhouses of India who thought they
were the real Jawaharlal Nehru, and some phony man</p><p>was ruling the country while they had been forced into the madhouse
so that they could not expose the phoniness of the man who had become
the prime minister.</p><p><br></p><p>In Bareilly, India has its biggest madhouse... and Jawaharlal was
going to Bareilly. One madman was thought by the doctors to be cured;
they thought it would be great – Jawaharlal was going to visit the
madhouse and this madman could be released from the madhouse by
Jawaharlal himself. This man would rejoice, and it would enhance the
prestige of the institution too.</p><p><br></p><p>The madman was brought to Jawaharlal. The first question he asked was
“Who are you?” The doctors were a little nervous. This is not the way to
talk to the prime minister of the country.</p><p><br></p><p>But Jawaharlal said, “My name is Jawaharlal Nehru.”</p><p><br></p><p>And the madman had a good laugh. He said, “Don’t be worried. Just
three years it will take, and you will be cured just as I am cured.
These doctors are great. When I came to this place, I used to think in
the same way – that I am Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru. Now you have come
–</p><p><br></p><p>strange coincidence, that I am going out and you are coming in.”</p><p><br></p><p>It has been happening in many instances throughout the world. During
the second world war, Winston Churchill had gone for an evening walk.
There used to be a certain fixed time that a horn would go off around
the city. Everybody had to go inside the house, lights had to be dimmed,
curtains had to be drawn. It was as if London had disappeared. But
walking, and worried about the war, Winston Churchill forgot about the
time and when he heard the horn he was miles away from his house. And it
was a standing order that if anybody was found on the road after the
horn stopped he could be shot, no questions would be asked. In a hurry,
he knocked at the first door – it was a question of life and death – and
a man opened the door. The man said, “Who are you?”</p><p>He said, “You don’t know me? I am Winston Churchill, prime minister
of this country, and you don’t know me?” And that man grabbed Churchill;
Churchill said, “What are you doing?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Come in, because there are three more Winston Churchills
here – this is a madhouse. Now all four of you decide who is the real
one.”</p><p><br></p><p>Churchill told him, “Listen, I am telling you the truth. I am the
real one.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “They all say the same thing, everybody is the real one. And
we don’t know any criteria to judge – they are all fat like you, they
all smoke cigars. They have been practicing being Winston Churchill for
years. When you see them, you yourself will understand that you are not
real; they are real.”</p><p><br></p><p>Churchill said, “My God, I have knocked on the wrong door.”</p><p><br></p><p>But the man was not going to let him go. He said, “Outside is death,
inside you can wait. In the morning we will figure out who is the real
one.”</p><p><br></p><p>And when he saw the three others, he himself had doubts about whether
he was the real one or these fellows were. They had the same kind of
clothes, cigars of the same type. He introduced himself – “I am Winston
Churchill.”</p><p>All three of them laughed. They said, “This is strange, now there are
four. This country is going down the drain, all the prime ministers are
inside the madhouse. At least one must be real.”</p><p><br></p><p>Winston Churchill tried, “Can I phone?”</p><p><br></p><p>He was refused. “That’s what they all ask: ‘Can we phone our
secretaries, our ministries, cabinet people?’ This is not allowed.
Anything that you want to do, you can do in the morning. If you are
really Winston Churchill, they will come. For these three nobody has
ever turned up, now we have to wait for you. Just don’t get mixed
up.”</p><p><br></p><p>No madman is ready to accept that he is mad.</p><p><br></p><p>Jean-Luc, what is your fear in becoming a sannyasin – because I have
said that unless a man becomes enlightened he is not truly healthy
because he is not truly whole; he is a confusion? I am not talking about
ordinary illnesses. I am talking about the fundamental sickness of the
soul, that you have forgotten yourself and you have become identified
with things which you are not.</p><p><br></p><p>A few years ago it happened in America: they celebrated Abraham
Lincoln’s birthday on a large scale, for one whole year. A special drama
was prepared about the life of Abraham Lincoln, and the whole of America
was searched to find a man who looked like him. And they did find one
man who looked like Abraham Lincoln; he was chosen. For one year he was
using exactly the same clothes as Abraham Lincoln, speaking in the same
way, walking in the same way. He was trained, because he would be going
around the country with the drama for the whole year.</p><p><br></p><p>Abraham Lincoln stuttered a little, so he was taught to stutter. He
was also a little lame – walking, one of his legs was a little longer
than the other. So great massage, traction was done on the poor man to
make one leg a little longer. Obviously he started walking like a lame
man, stuttering. Experts in voice training trained him to speak with
exactly the voice of Abraham Lincoln. He was made into an exact carbon
copy. And for one year continually, every night, he was performing.
People loved him, loved his acting, loved it that even Abraham Lincoln
could not do better.</p><p><br></p><p>When the year was finished he came home walking like Abraham Lincoln,
lame, stuttering. At first the family thought he was joking, but he was
not joking; it had become fixed in his mind that he WAS Abraham Lincoln.
He used the same dress, which was no longer in fashion, and urchins
would follow him on the street shouting, “Abraham Lincoln is
coming!”</p><p><br></p><p>He was taken to a psychoanalyst. He entered his office... but it was
no longer a part, it was no longer acting. He was so identified that he
told the psychoanalyst, “You should be respectful to the president of
the country.” The psychoanalyst gave him many sessions, but even in the
sessions he was stuttering – and he had never stuttered in his whole
life. The voice and everything that he had learned and practiced, and
for one year continually had to do.…</p><p><br></p><p>Finally the psychoanalyst called his family and said, “This man
cannot be cured, because it is not an illness. He has taken a new
identity, and unless he is shot just like Abraham Lincoln he is not
going to listen to anybody else. But shooting this poor man will not be
a cure; he will be finished, and he will die like Abraham Lincoln. That
will be really the proof that what he is saying is absolutely
right.”</p><p><br></p><p>Your confusion is your sickness.</p><p>Your mind is your sickness.</p><p><br></p><p>Coming to a state of no-mind is health, wholeness.</p><p><br></p><p>That is what is meant by enlightenment. You are no more identified
with the body. Have you ever thought for a single moment... you were a
child, you became a young man, you became old – which body is yours? And
the first day, when your mother got pregnant, on that day also you had a
body. If the picture is shown to you, it will be simply a picture of a
small egg – are you going to say that this is Jean-Luc?</p><p>And if it is not Jean-Luc, then you cannot be Jean-Luc either because
that small egg is the beginning, and then for nine months in the
mother’s womb you have passed through all the stages humanity has passed
through its evolution. First you have been a fish; that’s what has given
the idea to the scientists that life was born in the ocean. But
scientists have come to this conclusion only just now. In India, for
almost ten thousand years the idea has been prevalent that the first
incarnation of God was a fish, matsyavatar.</p><p>Strange that God should choose a fish to be his first incarnation –
but ‘God’ simply means life and nothing else; it is just that one is a
religious term, the other is a biological term. The scientists would say
that life was born in the ocean, but they both agree that the first
manifestation of life was that of a fish. And Charles Darwin came with
the idea of a monkey but in India, for centuries we have worshipped the
monkey-god Hanuman with great respect, because he is our forefather. Now
scientists are agreeing, because the last stage in the mother’s womb is
that of a monkey – the child looks like a monkey.</p><p>If all the photographs from the day you become part of your mother’s
womb to the day you come out of the womb are presented to you, you will
not be able to recognize any of them as your picture, that it is your
album.</p><p>Even after birth, if detailed pictures are being kept from his
childhood up to the age of seventy, a person will not be able to
recognize that at some time, some day he has been identified with all
these bodies. He is still there, those bodies are gone.</p><p>Man is not a body. Man is not a mind either. A Hindu has a Hindu
mind, a Christian has a Christian mind, a Buddhist has a Buddhist mind.
Mind is given to you by the society. What you bring with you is only a
brain, and that brain is a tabula rasa, nothing is written on it. You
can write Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, communism, or any nonsense. And
you are not left in freedom to choose what you would like to be written
on your brain. Before you are aware, the society has already filled your
mind completely with all kinds of superstitions. You are not a
Hindu.…</p><p>It was always a problem whenever there was census in this country.
The officers would come to me with their forms, and in their forms it
was to be filled in to what religion I belonged. And I said, “I don’t
belong to any religion.”</p><p>They said, “Then you have to write that you are an atheist.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I don’t belong to atheism either, because if there is no God
I am not going to waste my time in denying something which does not
exist. A few are worshipping him, a few are denying him – and he does
not exist at all. No, I am not an atheist.”</p><p>But they would say, “This is not right, the form has to be filled in
completely.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I am not here to fill in the form. You can take the form
incomplete – and anyway I am not going to vote, because it is so
difficult to choose which idiot to vote for. I have never voted in my
life.”</p><p><br></p><p>They would take their registers and run away, and they would look
again and again at me – “This man seems to be dangerous. He will not
fill in the form, and now he says ‘I cannot vote because the problem is
how to decide which idiot is less idiotic, it is a very difficult
psychological problem. You just take your registers and your forms. I am
just myself.’”</p><p><br></p><p>You are not the body, you are not the mind – these are your
sicknesses, your false identities. Enlightenment simply means coming
home, coming to the center which you are.</p><p>Why are you afraid to tell others that you want to become a
sannyasin, that you have filled in the form to become a sannyasin? –
because they will think you are sick. But the whole of humanity is
sick.</p><p><br></p><p>They will not laugh at you. They will appreciate your courage, that
you have accepted your sickness. This is the beginning of dissolving
it.</p><p><br></p><p>The most difficult thing is when a person does not accept his
sickness; then you cannot help him. He will throw away the medicine, he
will shut the door in the face of the doctor.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard that Mulla Nasruddin became old, very old – and as
people become old they become troublesome, they become more and more a
nuisance. Children are a nuisance, but nothing compared to old people,
because old people have experience – their nuisance is supported by
their experience, reason, logic; they have known the world. They will
not let anybody live in peace.</p><p><br></p><p>And as people become older they cannot sleep, because the function of
sleep is no more there. The child sleeps in the mother’s womb for
twenty-four hours a day, because he is growing so much that if he is
awake it will be a disturbance to his growth. Nature does not allow him
to be awake, but keeps him in a kind of anesthesia, fast asleep so he
can grow. Scientists say that in these nine months a child grows as much
as he will never grow again. In seventy years of life, he will never
again grow with such speed.</p><p><br></p><p>After the birth, sleep starts being cut. Then the child is sleeping
twenty-two hours, then twenty hours, then eighteen, then sixteen, then
fourteen.<span class=s4></span>And then by the age of fourteen he
comes to</p><p>the average of eight hours. But as he goes beyond fifty, again less
sleep – because now he has to prepare for death. In the mother’s womb he
was preparing for life; his body was growing, his brain was growing. It
was a subtle process, a delicate process; it needed complete silence.
Now everything is dying.<span class=s4></span>so beyond sixty, people
start becoming senile. Then they go on believing in</p><p>their old memories, their golden days – the future is dark. By the
time they reach seventy, two hours of sleep is enough.</p><p><br></p><p>Mulla Nasruddin had reached ninety years. Now he needed no sleep! It
would be okay if he kept quiet but he would not. He would wake up
everybody, start giving sermons and great advice to everybody. And they
told him, “In the day you can do everything.<span class=s4></span>”</p><p>He said, “In the day you have to do other kinds of work, you have to
live life. In the night you are all at home, and there is nothing to
do.” So he would gather everybody, wake everybody up and start giving
great sermons which were all nonsense. But he was the oldest man in the
town, the most respected – what to do with him?</p><p><br></p><p>His sons, his grandsons were all in agony: “Every night the house
becomes a church. Somehow we have to find somebody who can make him
sleep.” Many kinds of doctors were tried – allopathic, ayurvedic,
homeopathic, naturopathic, yunani; nobody succeeded. Finally they got
hold of a hypnotist who said, “Don’t be worried. This is my business, to
put people to sleep.”</p><p><br></p><p>Nasruddin heard that they were going to bring a hypnotist. He said,
“Okay, let him come.”</p><p><br></p><p>The hypnotist came with his bag. Nasruddin was lying down on the bed.
And the hypnotist said, “Listen, it is very easy to sleep. Just relax. I
will give suggestions and you have simply to follow. First I will give
suggestions to relax the body, each part of the body, so no tension
remains. Then I will suggest that you are falling into sleep... deeper,
deeper, deeper. Don’t resist.”</p><p><br></p><p>Nasruddin followed. His family was surprised, because he was not a
man to listen to anybody – perhaps the hypnotist had some power. And he
started giving him suggestions. Nasruddin relaxed, and the whole family
was very happy; they could see his whole body completely relaxed. And
then suggestions for sleep... and even the hypnotist was surprised,
because he was not only sleeping, he was snoring. The family was very
thankful. His fee was ten rupees, but they gave him twenty rupees and
they said, “You are the only one who has been successful.”</p><p><br></p><p>And as they went out to take him to his car and came back in,
Nasruddin opened one eye and asked, “Has that nut gone or not? Now
everybody gather, and the sermon begins: You idiots, you should have
given me twenty rupees and I would have been silent the whole night.
Just give me twenty rupees each night and I will be silent. Don’t waste
money this way. Rather than talking business to me, you are bringing
these idiots. I befooled him within seconds – and he believed even the
snoring. Who has ever heard that in hypnosis people snore? He does not
know even the ABC of hypnosis.”</p><p><br></p><p>Everybody is in confusion, young or old. Sick, sick unto death, but
nobody is willing to accept it. On the contrary, he is throwing out the
doctors, proving that “I am not sick.”</p><p><br></p><p>Accepting your sickness is the beginning of gaining health. So don’t
be worried; tell sannyasins that you are joining them on the path. They
will not laugh at you.</p><p><br></p><p>And it is not a question of one person; the whole world is in the
same situation. Only once in a while a person becomes enlightened. It
should not be so, but unfortunately this is the case. Everybody has the
potential to be enlightened – but the very first step and you don’t have
guts to say that “I am sick, sick of the mind, confused, split,
schizophrenic. One moment I am feeling good, another moment I am feeling
bad, and I don’t know who I am, still I go on dragging. I don’t know
anything of reality, still I have beliefs about everything. All my
knowledge is just a burden. My reality is that of a patient.”</p><p><br></p><p>And you have put it rightly. What is the relationship between the
master and the disciple? – exactly the same as that of the physician and
the patient.</p><p>I will tell you a small story.</p><p><br></p><p>Gautam Buddha came into a town. That town had a blind man who was a
great logician, very rational, and the whole town had tried to tell him
that light exists, but nobody could prove it.</p><p><br></p><p>There is no way to prove light. Either you can see it or you cannot
see it, but there is no other proof.</p><p><br></p><p>The blind man said, “I am ready. I can touch things and I can feel
them with my hands. You bring your light and I would like to touch it
and feel it.”</p><p><br></p><p>But light is not something tangible. They said, “No, it cannot be
touched or felt.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I have other ways. I can smell it, I can taste it. I can
beat it and hear the sound. But these are my only instruments – my ears,
my nose, my tongue, my hands – I am making available to you my whole
personality. Should I listen to my own personality, or should I listen
to you? I say there is no light; it is simply an invention, an invention
of cunning people to deceive simple people like me so that you can prove
that I am blind and you have eyes. The whole strategy is that you are
not interested in light, you are interested in proving that you have
eyes and I don’t have eyes. You want to be higher, superior. Because you
cannot be logically, rationally superior to me you have brought in
something absurd. Forget all about it, you are all blind. Nobody has
seen light because light does not exist.”</p><p>When they heard that Buddha had come to the town, the people said,
“It is a good opportunity. We should take our logician the blind man to
Gautam Buddha; perhaps he can convince him – and we cannot find a better
man.”</p><p><br></p><p>They brought the blind man to Gautam Buddha. They told the whole
story that was going on: one blind man was proving them all blind, was
proving that there is no light, and they were absolutely incapable of
proving the existence of light.</p><p><br></p><p>The words of Gautam Buddha are worth remembering. He said, “You have
brought him to the wrong person. He does not need a philosopher, he
needs a physician. It is not a question of convincing him, it is a
question of curing his eyes. But don’t be worried, I have my personal
physician with me.” One of the emperors of those days had given his own
personal physician to Gautam Buddha to take care of him twenty-four
hours a day, to be with him like a shadow.</p><p>He asked the physician, “You take care of this man’s eyes.”</p><p><br></p><p>The physician looked at the man’s eyes and he said, “It is not a
difficult case; just a certain growth is covering his eyes, which can be
removed. It may take at the most six months.”</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha left his physician in the village, and after six months the
man opened his eyes. All his logic, all his rationality disappeared. He
said, “My God, I was telling those simple people that they were cheating
me, deceiving me. Light exists – I was blind! Had I accepted the idea of
my blindness before, there would have been no need for me to live my
whole life in blindness.”</p><p>Buddha had gone far away in six months, but the man came dancing,
fell at Buddha’s feet and said to him, “Your compassion is great that
you did not argue with me, that you did not try to convince me about the
light but gave me a physician.”</p><p>Buddha said, “This is my whole work. There are spiritually blind
people all around. And my work is not to convince them about the beauty,
the blissfulness, the ecstasy of existence; my work is that of a
physician.”</p><p><br></p><p>And that is the relationship between a master and a disciple. The
disciple comes, openly accepting that “I am sick, I need your help. I am
blind, I need my eyes to be cured. I want to see what you have seen. I
want to be what you have become.”</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>HOW CAN I BECOME A DISCIPLE?</p><p><br></p><p>What is the need to become a disciple? Why should you ask such a
question?</p><p><br></p><p>Do you feel your life is meaningless, that you need some meaning? Do
you feel your life is empty and you would like fulfillment? Do you feel
you are in darkness and you would like to be in the light?</p><p><br></p><p>The whole thing depends on you.</p><p><br></p><p>If you are contented as you are, if you are not missing anything as
you are, there is no need to be a disciple. Why bother a master, and why
go into an unnecessary search? But if you have emptiness,
meaninglessness, anxiety, anguish, confusion, darkness; if you feel your
whole life is nothing but misery, then to become a disciple is very
simple.</p><p><br></p><p>It simply means to contact someone who is fulfilled, who has no
questions left, who is only an answer.</p><p><br></p><p>The disciple is a question. The master is an answer.</p><p>And as far as I am concerned, there are no conditions on the
disciple. Nothing is imposed on the disciple; on the contrary, he is
helped to drop unnecessary luggage and be as light as possible.</p><p><br></p><p>Just be receptive to someone whom you feel is not miserable, whom you
feel lives in ecstasy, radiates blissfulness, in whose presence you feel
a silence descending on you. Then open your heart to him. You have
nothing to lose except your miseries.</p><p><br></p><p>Karl Marx ends his COMMUNIST MANIFESTO with a tremendously important
message, although in a different context – but it is as useful to the
disciple as he thought it was useful to the proletariat. He says,
“Proletarians of the whole world, unite! And don’t be afraid because you
have nothing to lose except your chains.” It may not be correct in the
context in which he was talking – because communist revolutions have
happened; chains have changed, freedom has not come. First there used to
be bourgeois chains, now there are communist chains – which are more up
to date, stronger, more difficult to get rid of.</p><p>But in the context in which I am quoting it, it is tremendously
beautiful: a disciple has nothing to lose except his misery. Because you
don’t have anything other than misery, but you go on hiding your misery
as if you have a treasure.</p><p><br></p><p>And you are asking how to be a disciple.</p><p><br></p><p>Just drop your misery at somebody’s feet in whose eyes you see some
rays going beyond darkness, indicating a path to blissfulness and
benediction.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 3 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>FOR MORE THAN TEN YEARS I HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING YOU FROM PLACE TO
PLACE. I CAN’T BELIEVE THAT I AM BACK IN INDIA. AM I BRAINWASHED,
ADDICTED, OR WHAT?</p><p><br></p><p>You are certainly brainwashed.</p><p><br></p><p>I use a dry cleaning machine, I am not old-fashioned. And naturally
you are addicted. Who will not be?</p><p><br></p><p>Addiction is not always bad. If you are addicted to beauty, to
poetry, to drama, to sculpture, to painting, nobody tells you to drop
the addiction. Addiction has to be dropped only when it makes you
unconscious. Alcoholics are told to drop the addiction, but here my
teaching is of consciousness – be addicted to it more and more.</p><p><br></p><p>And what is wrong in being brainwashed? – wash it every day, keep it
clean. Do you like cockroaches? When I brainwash people, I find
cockroaches. Cockroaches are very special animals. It has been found
scientifically that wherever you find man you find cockroaches, and
wherever you find cockroaches you find man. They are always together,
they are the oldest companions.</p><p><br></p><p>What have you got in your brain? So just washing it is perfectly
right. But people have given it a very wrong connotation; those are the
wrong people.</p><p><br></p><p>Christians are afraid of somebody brainwashing Christians, because
then they will not be Christians. Hindus are afraid because then those
people will not be Hindus. Mohammedans are afraid, communists are
afraid.</p><p><br></p><p>Everybody is afraid of brainwashing. I am in absolute favor of
it.</p><p>There used to be an old saying: “Cleanliness is next to God.” Now
there is no God, so there is only cleanliness left.</p><p><br></p><p>Cleanliness is God.</p><p>And I am not afraid of brainwashing because I am not putting
cockroaches in your mind. I am giving you an opportunity to experience a
clean mind, and once you know a clean mind you will never allow anybody
to throw rubbish and crap into your mind. They are the criminals.</p><p><br></p><p>Brainwashing is not a crime – who has made it dirty? Dirtying other
people’s minds is a crime, but all over the world all the religions, all
the political leaders, are using your mind as if it is a toilet. These
ugly fellows have condemned brainwashing; otherwise, brainwashing is a
perfectly good job.</p><p><br></p><p>I am a brainwasher.</p><p><br></p><p>And those who come to me should come with the clear conception that
they are going to a man who is bound to brainwash, clean their minds of
all kinds of cockroaches. Hindu, Mohammedan, Christian – they are all
against me for the simple reason that they go on putting in their
cockroaches, and I go on washing people’s minds.</p><p><br></p><p>It is just an up-to-date religious laundry. Question 4</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>I EXPERIENCED SO MUCH ENERGY, INSIGHT AND EXPANDED AWARENESS WHEN I
WAS A PATIENT OF RAJEN, TEERTHA, AMITABH AND SOMENDRA.</p><p><br></p><p>NOW, EACH OF THEIR REACTIONS TO YOUR COMMENTS SEEM FULL OF THE EGO
PROBLEMS THEY EACH POINTED OUT IN ME. IT IS AS IF EACH OF THEM SAW THEIR
OWN PROBLEM IN ME, AND I ACCEPTED IT AS A CORRECT INSIGHT INTO
MYSELF.</p><p><br></p><p>HOW CAN SUCH BEAUTIFUL MEN, WHO APPEARED TO BE SO FULL OF YOUR GRACE
AND SO DEVOTED TO SANNYAS, ALSO BE SO DUMB?</p><p><br></p><p>Bodhicitta, it is a simple phenomenon.</p><p><br></p><p>The people who had allowed me their total receptivity had become my
messengers, but their function was not more than that of a postman. When
you receive a love letter, don’t start kissing the postman!</p><p><br></p><p>But Bodhicitta himself is a psychoanalyst and he has developed a few
techniques of his own, which may look stupid to you, but in America
stupidity and spirituality are synonymous.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, Bodhicitta has developed a psychological technique
called ‘hugging’; so the whole group of twenty or thirty people just go
on hugging each other. It is good exercise, particularly in cold
countries, but don’t try anything like that here in Bombay. In Bombay
only enlightened people can hug each other, and it is very rare to find
two enlightened people.</p><p><br></p><p>You had seen those therapists who were working in the commune in
Poona under me – and they were going around the world, because I was not
going anywhere. I had prepared them to be just a passage; that’s why you
felt that they were so innocent, such beautiful people.</p><p>And what has happened to them now? Just something natural.</p><p><br></p><p>There is a story: In Jagannathpuri every year the chariot of
Jagannath, the lord of the world, goes around the city. Millions of
people gather to see it.</p><p><br></p><p>Once it happened, a dog was moving ahead of the chariot and everybody
was falling, kissing the earth – and the dog was puffed up; he thought,
“My God, I never thought that I am Jagannath, the lord of the world.
Millions of people have come, and they are all bowing down to me.”</p><p><br></p><p>The poor dog was not logically wrong; it was happening. He was not
aware that they were touching the earth, doing their deep, respectful
bowing down to the Jagannath in the chariot. All that he could see was
that they were doing it to him.</p><p><br></p><p>The therapists who went around the world found sannyasins everywhere
receiving them with as much love and respect as if I had come there.
They had come as my representatives, they were sent by me. But what
happened to those poor fellows? They started thinking that all this
respect, all this love was for them. So when the commune was destroyed
by the American government and there was a chaos, those few therapists
started behaving as if they were enlightened, calling themselves
enlightened.</p><p><br></p><p>I have received hundreds of letters saying that, “Osho, we don’t find
the same quality in these people as we used to find before. They are the
same people, but Your presence is no more with them.”</p><p><br></p><p>Even the participants in their groups have written to me, “Groups are
the same, techniques are the same, but You are not there. And now we
know that the miracle was not the technique but Your presence.” Their
groups are being deserted now; soon they will not find a single
sannyasin going to them.</p><p><br></p><p>And if they have a little bit of intelligence, they will come back
with a deep apology. They have betrayed. They were only mediums, they
are not enlightened.</p><p><br></p><p>And this is the difference: You can know a technique – but just to
know a technique is one thing, to be a master is totally different. That
is the difference between a scientist and a technologist. The scientist
himself discovers – it is his own discovery, it is his own authority.
The technologist simply imitates. He can do perfectly well as far as the
objective world is concerned, but as far as the subjective world is
concerned it is not possible.</p><p><br></p><p>Only the master can bring the transformation. The mediums can simply
spread his word. The moment they start thinking that the respect and the
honor is being given to them, they are no longer mediums. Then a dead
technique is in their hands, which is not going to help.</p><p><br></p><p>It happened in Rome – each year there used to be a great competition
of paintings. One year a painting was chosen, but one painter stood up
and said, “There is something incomplete in it, it is not perfect.
Whoever has done it is a technician but not a painter.”</p><p><br></p><p>He was asked, “Can you make it perfect?”</p><p>He came...”Yes, not much is missing, but what is missing is the very
soul.” And he simply touched the lips of the painting with his brush. It
had been looking sad and now it was smiling. And he said, “Now it is
perfect. Whoever has done it should be given the award, but he is only a
technician – a perfect technician – but he is not a master, because this
smile is the soul of the whole painting.” And because of that smile the
whole painting was changed, the whole context was different.</p><p><br></p><p>One man in America purchased one of Picasso’s paintings for one
million dollars, but he was suspicious about whether it was an original
or not – because there are so many technicians who are copying great
paintings with such perfection that it is impossible to make a
distinction unless you are an expert. He took the painting to one of the
greatest critics, and the critic said, “You need not be worried about
this painting. This painting Picasso has done in front of me, I was
staying with him.”</p><p><br></p><p>But doubt is such a thing... it does not leave so easily.</p><p><br></p><p>The American then said, “I will pay the fare and whatever expenses.
You come with me to Paris, and we have to ask Picasso himself – and you
be present. I want to be absolutely certain that it is a Picasso.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “It is absolutely certain, you are unnecessarily wasting
money. But there is no question, I am ready.”</p><p><br></p><p>They reached Paris and they went to see Picasso. The painting was
shown to him and the man asked, “Is it an original Picasso?”</p><p><br></p><p>And Picasso said, “No.”</p><p><br></p><p>The critic said, “Are you mad? Have you forgotten that I was staying
with you at the time you were painting this?”</p><p><br></p><p>Picasso said, “No, I have not forgotten that. You were staying here
when I was painting this, but it is not an original.”</p><p><br></p><p>The critic said, “What do you mean it is not an original? You painted
it!”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “You have to understand my definition of originality. I had
painted the same painting before. And there was no new idea coming to my
mind, so I repainted it. It was only a technical job, there was no
mastery – any technician could have done it. Does it matter that the
technician is Picasso himself? It is not an original painting, it is a
copy. And if you don’t believe me you can go to the museum where the
original is hanging.”</p><p><br></p><p>They went and they could not make out any difference between the two.
But one was an original idea and the other was only a carbon copy, done
by the same man.</p><p><br></p><p>Bodhicitta, the therapists who are behaving in an utterly stupid way
will have to return, because whoever has been with me cannot become a
part of the world again. And once the sannyasins desert them – they are
deserting them – those therapists will find that their idea that the
respect was given to them was wrong. But they have to learn it the hard
way.</p><p>You are fortunate. You go on doing your hugging meditation – in
America; don’t mention it in India. It works in America, because for
hundreds of years Christianity has made people so conditioned, that even
to touch somebody is a sin. If you see a beautiful woman and you want
just to touch her face because it is so beautiful, you will find
yourself in the police station. And you were not asking anything; you
would have touched her face, thanked the woman – and her husband – and
gone your way. And the husband should be proud that he has such a wife
that wherever he goes people come to touch her face.</p><p><br></p><p>Christianity has made touching a sin. People have to be separate,
particularly men and woman have to be separate. Even in the church they
have to be separate, in the synagogue they have to be separate.</p><p><br></p><p>So your idea is perfectly good – but in a cold country, where people
are not perspiring. Let them do as much hugging as they want and they
will feel great. Because touching each other’s body is touching each
other’s energy, and if it is a group where friends are together it
becomes a loving phenomenon. There is no harm in it.</p><p><br></p><p>But don’t mention such a thing here.</p><p><br></p><p>He has opened an institute in Nepal. I was worried about him; this
kind of psychotherapy in Nepal or India is not needed. California.<span class=s4></span>If you have got a crazy idea simply go to California –
any crazy</p><p>idea and you will find followers, ready-made followers who were just
waiting for some crazy idiot to come. And now you have been in the East
long enough; you will get a good following in California.</p><p><br></p><p>But don’t be worried about these therapists. They will disappear just
like soap bubbles because there is no reality, of enlightenment.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 5 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>I HEARD YOU ONCE COMPARE THE WORK OF A MASTER TO THAT OF A SURGEON.
IN THESE TERMS, BEING WITH YOU AS YOUR DISCIPLE, I HAVE EXPERIENCED YOU
CUTTING VERY THOROUGHLY THROUGH WHATEVER MY MASKS ARE.</p><p><br></p><p>HOW CAN YOU ACTUALLY DO NOTHING, AND YET GIVE ME SUCH AN INDIVIDUAL
SURGICAL TREATMENT?</p><p><br></p><p>‘Nothing’ is my sword; it is so thin you cannot see it.</p><p><br></p><p>And the work is certainly so delicate, it cannot be done with crude
instruments. Do you see the sword of ‘nothing’ in my hands?</p><p>It is there. Question 6</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>HOW MUCH LONGER WILL I HAVE TO RUN AFTER YOU?</p><p><br></p><p>It depends on you.</p><p><br></p><p>You can run by my side or you can even run ahead of me, but just
don’t run away. Question 7</p><p>BELOVED MASTER,</p><p><br></p><p>LIVING IN THE MOMENT, MY MEMORY BECOMES WORSE AND WORSE. DOING
NOTHING, MY BODY AND MIND ARE GETTING MORE AND MORE LAZY. CLOSING MY
EYES, I SEE NOTHING BUT DARKNESS.</p><p><br></p><p>ALL IN ALL, I ENJOY THIS, AND FEEL CONTENTED AND THANKFUL, BUT ONE
QUESTION DISTURBS ME: HOW CAN I KNOW THAT THIS IS NOT THE CONTENTMENT OF
A DONKEY?</p><p><br></p><p>Niskriya – it is really the work of a donkey, but you are not an
ordinary donkey. You are a German donkey!</p><p><br></p><p>What do you call a donkey in German – esel. You are an esel.</p><p><br></p><p>But German donkeys have always done great things – two world wars,
and without them the third is impossible. There are donkeys in every
country but nobody can compete with a German donkey. There are Indian
donkeys – you cannot tell them “Sitting silently, doing nothing” because
that’s what they have been doing for centuries, and the grass has not
grown yet!</p><p><br></p><p>For the grass to grow, a German donkey is needed. Because for the
Indian donkey it is simply natural, there is nothing special in it; for
the German donkey, sitting silently doing nothing seems to be
impossible. And because it seems impossible, if he can manage it, the
grass will have to grow. So Niskriya, don’t be worried. Be at ease.</p><p><br></p><p>And donkeys are not bad people... very philosophical.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not a coincidence that Germany has produced the greatest
philosophers in the world. Donkeys are philosophical, they are
continuously thinking. Just watch a donkey. You will never find a donkey
UNthinking.</p><p><br></p><p>But the poor donkey has been condemned almost all over the world for
the simple reason that he does not write scriptures, does not give
sermons, does not get crucified. He is so utterly simple and lives so
silently – as if he is not. In this whole world, so much is going on,
but for the donkeys nothing is going on; they live in a timeless
moment.</p><p><br></p><p>So Niskriya, when I say you are a donkey, don’t feel bad about it.
Sitting in your room, just think of yourself as esel, and enjoy it. It
is far better than insane human beings, far better than all kinds of</p><p>sick souls. Have you ever heard of any donkey going mad, or any
donkey going to a psychiatrist, or any donkey committing suicide, or any
donkey committing a murder, or any donkey committing a rape? Such
innocent people... I support them perfectly. So remember, even if the
world condemns them, I am here in total support. Relax, however
difficult it is.</p><p><br></p><p>But if a German decides to relax, he will relax. An Indian decides
many times to relax, but he never relaxes.</p><p><br></p><p>I used to stay in a very rich man’s house in Calcutta. His name was
Sohanlal Dugad. He was a man of seventy-five or eighty years of age, but
he loved me very much and he had taken a promise that I would not stay
anywhere else as long as he was alive. I had with me a friend who was a
fanatic religious type. He was a celibate, and he was trying to renounce
the world and become a monk. And in the night when we were sitting and
gossiping, Sohanlal Dugad said, “In my life I have taken three times the
vow of brahmacharya, of celibacy.” My friend was very much
impressed.</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “You idiot. For brahmacharya, for celibacy, one needs to take
the vow only one time. Three times?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I never thought about it. Yes, that is correct. We should
ask what happened with the fourth time!”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “That is an embarrassing question to ask an old man. He
himself would have said that after the third time he recognized the fact
that it was beyond his capacity. It is better not to bother about it.”
But he insisted.</p><p><br></p><p>Next morning he asked him, and the old man said, “The fourth time?
Don’t you think three times is enough? For a fourth time I could not
gather the courage – three times failing.<span class=s4></span>”</p><p><br></p><p>The Indian decides to meditate, to relax, to become a sannyasin. But
he is always having good thoughts.…</p><p><br></p><p>You are fortunate, Niskriya, that you are German. If you decide to
relax, it can be depended upon, reliable – and it will not disturb your
work, I know.</p><p><br></p><p>He is a master of his work, he is a great filmmaker in Germany but he
decided to close the whole business and just follow me. You might not
understand that he has closed a big flourishing business; he was earning
immense money, and now he simply takes my pictures and nothing else.
This decisiveness is of tremendous value. This decisiveness gives you a
spine.</p><p><br></p><p>And you must see his work, with what concentration he looks after
every minute detail. It takes him four hours every day to set up his
camera here, and he must be thinking continually about how to improve –
because I go on seeing new improvements<span class=s4></span>these new
umbrellas have appeared!</p><p><br></p><p>So many people have been making the films, and they all have been
harming my eyes. He is the first man who has thought about my eyes
first. That’s why these umbrellas<span class=s4></span>my eyes are not
affected at</p><p>all.</p><p>But such minute concern, and a decisiveness to do something to its
perfection – the same thing can be turned into any dimension. If it
becomes spirituality, it will be the same – the same quality, the same
determination, the same devotion.</p><p><br></p><p>So if you are feeling relaxed, it is not against action. One has to
understand that relaxation is the very source of energy; it can be
converted into action. In the night you go to sleep so that in the
morning you are rejuvenated. The night has not been a wastage, the night
has helped you to recover the energy that you have used before. Again
you are young, again fresh.</p><p><br></p><p>In meditation, whatever happens is bound to be expressed in
creativity. What you are doing is a creative act, and for your creative
act you have renounced everything. For your love you have renounced
everything. It will be appreciated by people when they come to know of
it.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part22>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

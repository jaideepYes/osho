DAYLIGHT DELIGHTS ME,</p><p>SLEEP AT NIGHT GIVES NO REST.</p><p><br></p><p>WHO CAN I TELL ABOUT THIS?</p><p><br></p><p>THE NIGHT IS DARK AND LONG... HOURS GO BY... BECAUSE I AM ALONE, I
SIT UP SUDDENLY, FEAR GOES THROUGH ME.…</p><p><br></p><p>KABIR SAYS: LISTEN, MY FRIEND</p><p><br></p><p>THERE IS ONE THING IN THE WORLD THAT SATISFIES, AND THAT IS A MEETING
WITH THE GUEST.</p><p>MAN is not what he is; man has become what he is not; that’s the root
cause of his misery. He has</p><p>gone astray from his being, he has become too involved in
becoming.</p><p><br></p><p>2</p><p><br></p><p>To become means to become false. To become means to become that which
you are not. To be is already the case. Man has not to become anything
other than he is, he has to relax into his being and know the truth.</p><p><br></p><p>The truth is already given, the truth is not somewhere in the future.
It is not a goal but the source. You are coming from truth. If you can
find the source again you will know what truth is. You are not going
towards truth; all going takes you farther and farther away from
truth.</p><p><br></p><p>You must have heard the name of Radha. Mythologically she is known to
be the most beloved woman of Krishna. He had many lovers; Radha was the
suprememost. But historically there has never been any woman by the name
of Radha, and in the ancient scriptures her name is not mentioned at
all. It is an invention of later mystics, later sages, and it has
tremendous significance; it will be good to understand it.</p><p>In Sanskrit there is a word, DHARA, which means the river moving from
the source towards the ocean. If you reverse the word DHARA it becomes
RADHA. Radha means the river moving towards the origin, not towards the
ocean; radha is a metaphor. And one can be a beloved of God only if one
turns the whole process of life – from being a DHARA one becomes a
RADHA, not moving towards the goal but going deeper and deeper down
towards the source.</p><p><br></p><p>And the source is within you! The goal is without, the source,
within. The source is your very being.</p><p>But mind is aggressive – it wants to explore, it wants to go on
adventures, it wants to know that which is not known, it wants to
demystify existence. It wants to conquer, it is on a journey of
conquest. Mind is masculine, basically masculine, and through the mind
there is no way towards God.</p><p><br></p><p>One has to become feminine. One has to become receptive rather than
being aggressive. One has to learn the art of relaxation rather than
learning the strategies of how to conquer the world and the reality.
Truth is not going to be a conquest, it is going to be a total
surrender. One has to become a host, one has to open up, one has to be
just a receptivity so the wind can come in, the rain can come in, the
sun can come in. And just hidden behind the sun and the rain and the
wind one day comes the Guest. And the Guest does not come from the
outside, it arises within you. God is the Guest. But you have to be a
host first, you have to learn the art of being a host. You have to
become a welcome, you have to become a prayer, you have to become an
invitation, and you have to become a waiting, an infinite waiting. If it
takes ages for Him to come you have to wait, of course with tears in
your eyes but with tremendous trust in the heart.</p><p><br></p><p>Kabir calls God the Guest because he wants the seeker to be the host.
The masculine mind cannot become the host. The masculine mind can only
become an aggressor; it knows how to snatch things away. The masculine
mind is a doer, a great doer, hence the masculine mind gives birth to
science; science is basically male.</p><p><br></p><p>Religion is female, and those who want to enter into the world of
religion have to understand it very deeply because it is very
fundamental. If you miss this point you will miss all. You have to
become feminine. And when I say’feminine’ I don’t mean biologically; it
is not a question of man and woman, it is not a question of physiology –
it is a question of your psychology. You may have the body of a woman
and yet the psychology may be masculine.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what is happening now: many women are turning masculine,
becoming more aggressive. In the name of liberation they are losing
something infinitely valuable. For the mundane they are losing the
contact with the sacred. The woman has always remained in a subtle way
connected with the sacred. The woman has been the contact of mankind
with God, but now she is becoming more and more masculine.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not a question of physiology, biology, remember; you may have
the body of a man and you may have the psychology that I call feminine,
receptive. Buddha is feminine if you look at his psychology, Jesus is
feminine if you look at his psychology.</p><p>Friedrich Nietzsche was the first to point out the fact that Buddha
and Jesus are ‘womanish’. Of course he was criticizing, he was not
appreciating the fact, but he was the first to point it out; he had that
intuitive genius. He used his genius in a very wrong way; he would have
become a Buddha himself, but he used his talents in a destructive way
and released the greatest destructive force on the earth up to now.</p><p><br></p><p>Fascism, nazism are nothing but offshoots of Nietzsche’s mind. He was
very masculine, he appreciated the masculine mind: he appreciated the
soldier not the sannyasin, he appreciated war not love, he appreciated
swords not flowers, he appreciated destruction, murder, conquest. He did
not appreciate the beauty of surrender, trust, love, friendship, no;
those were not his values. He did not appreciate compassion, ecstasy,
celebration, no; those were not his values. Hence he criticized Buddha
and Jesus, more particularly Jesus. When he said Jesus is feminine he
was condemning Jesus.</p><p><br></p><p>I also say Jesus is feminine, but I am not condemning him – I cannot
appreciate him more. To say Jesus and Buddha are feminine is the
greatest appreciation possible, because they have become hosts, they
have become open, vulnerable to existence. They have sent the invitation
and they are simply waiting.</p><p>The way of Buddha is meditation, the way of Jesus is prayer, but
these are simply different names for the same phenomenon. Meditation
means becoming silent, utterly silent, becoming a no-mind, and prayer
also means becoming a deep listening. What you think is prayer is not
prayer. You think saying something to God is prayer? It is not prayer at
all! What can you say to God, what have you to say to God? Real prayer
begins only when you start listening to God, when you become utterly
silent, just a listening; then meditation and prayer come very close.
Meditation is silence and prayer too is silence – just different names
for the same phenomenon.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus and Buddha are feminine, and that’s what Kabir wants you to
understand and to be. Kabir used to say of himself, “I am a woman
married to God, God is my lover. I am fortunate that He has chosen me as
his wife, as his beloved.” He has sung many songs in which he says RAM
KI DULHANIYA – “I am wedded to Rama, I am wedded to God.” Kabir is
giving you tremendously important insights in his simple poetry.</p><p>The first thing to be understood is that becoming is driving you
crazy. You are not to become anything, you are already that. You have to
accept yourself and relax in that acceptance. The person who is trying
to become something is bound to remain tense, naturally: the constant
fear of whether he is going to make it or not, the constant fear of
whether what he is doing is going to lead</p><p><br></p><p>him to the goal or not, whether he has chosen the right path or not,
the constant fear of whether he is doing enough to achieve or not, the
constant fear that there are others who may reach before him. Becoming
creates fear, becoming creates competition, and becoming drives you
crazy, neurotic. Becoming takes you farther and farther away from your
being.</p><p><br></p><p>Do not become... be, just be. Becoming is the root cause of all
confusion, misery and anguish – confusion because in fact you cannot
become that which you are not. The rose can try as much as possible, but
it is going to remain a rose, it can’t become a lotus. The lotus can try
hard, can practise all kinds of yoga exercises, but the lotus is going
to remain a lotus, it can’t become a rose. A rose is a rose and a lotus
is a lotus. But the lotus is beautiful and the rose is beautiful and
there is NO confusion, because the rose is perfectly happy in being a
rose and the lotus is perfectly happy in being a lotus. Only man is
miserable.</p><p><br></p><p>The only being who is miserable on the earth is man, because he is
not happy in being himself; he wants to become something else. We have
been brought up with this poison: “Become!” We have been driven by the
society, by the church, by the parents, by the teachers: “Become!”
Nobody says to us: “Be!” And if you can find a person who says to you,
“Be!” that is the person to listen to, that is the real Master, because
he is giving you the most fundamental thing. Through that vision you
will be able to relax, and in relaxation there is clarity.</p><p><br></p><p>Confusion arises out of the idea of becoming because you become a
duality – that which you are and that which you would like to be. You
become a duality and a great tension, and you have to deny your reality
and you have to impose the unreal upon yourself. You become phony, you
become pseudo, you become split. And what I am saying is not
theoretical; you can look all around – the whole humanity is split
because everybody is trying to become somebody else. Somebody is trying
to become a Christ, somebody else is trying to become a Buddha, somebody
else is trying to become the richest man in the world, somebody is
trying to become the president of a country, but becoming... in the name
of religion also, becoming.</p><p>Then what is the difference between religion and the ordinary worldly
affairs? If the worldly man is trying to become the richest man or the
most powerful man, and the religious man also is trying to become
somebody – a Buddha, a Krishna – then where is the difference? Both are
in the same boat; the name of the boat is becoming.</p><p>The truly religious person is one who drops out of the whole trip of
becoming, who relaxes in his being, who rejoices in his being, who says,
“I am that” – AHAM BRAHMASMI – “I am already that”; ANA’L HAQ – “I am
truth, I am God.” These are just expressions of being. The basic message
is: “I am already that, so I need not try to become.”</p><p>I have heard one of the most beautiful stories about a Hassid Master,
Sosya.</p><p><br></p><p>About seven hundred years ago a great Master and mystic named Sosya,
ripe with years and honors, lay dying. His students and disciples asked
if he was afraid to die.</p><p>“Yes,” he said. “I am afraid to meet my maker.”</p><p>“How can that be? You have lived such an exemplary life. You have led
us out of the wilderness of ignorance like Moses. You have judged
between us wisely, like Solomon.”</p><p><br></p><p>Sosya replied, “When I meet my maker, He will not ask, ‘Have you been
Moses or Solomon?’ He will ask, ‘Have you been Sosya?’” This is one of
the most beautiful stories; meditate over it. Sosya says: “God will not
ask me, ‘Have you been Moses or Solomon?’ He will ask me, ‘Have you been
Sosya?’”</p><p><br></p><p>And remember, God is going to ask you the same thing. He will not ask
you, “Have you been Jesus or Buddha or Kabir?” He will simply ask you,
“Have you been yourself?” – and that is not happening, not to millions
of people. They are all trying to be somebody else, something else;
rejecting their beings they go on rushing towards some idea of becoming.
They remain in confusion because they remain in duality, and they remain
in misery because it is not possible; they are trying the
impossible.</p><p>Remember, misery arises only when you try the impossible, because it
can’t happen in the nature of things and you want it to happen. You want
two plus two to be five: you will be miserable unless you see the point
that two plus two CANNOT be five. You may even believe for a few moments
that they are five, but sooner or later the truth will reveal itself –
they are four. How long can you deceive, and what is the point of
deceiving? You are simply wasting your life.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t try the impossible – and becoming is trying the impossible. You
cannot be anybody other than you are; let this idea sink deep into your
heart. Let me repeat: you cannot be anybody other than you are, there is
no becoming. All becoming is the world. Not to be a part of becoming is
to be a sannyasin.</p><p><br></p><p>Who is a sannyasin? – one who is no more worried about becoming
somebody because he is absolutely attuned with his being, he knows who
he is and he is happy in being that; one who is grateful in being that.
Misery comes whenever you try the impossible, so whenever you are
miserable remember: you must be trying something impossible.</p><p><br></p><p>Bliss is an outcome of simply being the natural. Bliss is not an
achievement, it is a by-product of relaxing with yourself, of simply
being that which you are. Then THIS very moment all misery can
disappear, and THIS very moment there is bliss, and THIS very moment
there is benediction... and the heavens open up and God starts
showering. And suddenly, a great stirring is felt in the heart: one who
has been asleep becomes awake.</p><p>Becoming is your sleep. Being is your Buddhahood, being is your
awakening. And becoming creates anguish because you have to find ways
and means, and everything fails, nothing ever succeeds. Nothing can ever
succeed. Hence great anguish arises: your life, which could have bloomed
in flowers, becomes only a bed of thorns.</p><p><br></p><p>But you are responsible and nobody else; it is your life, it is your
responsibility. You have to take care about your being. And the greatest
thing that can be said to you is: just be yourself. Carry no idea about
how you should be – drop all’hows’, drop all ideas, drop all ideologies,
drop all concepts, images of how you should be. You are already that!
Start enjoying that which you are, and then this very ordinary life
suddenly becomes extraordinary. Then these ordinary days have such
tremendous poetry, then these ordinary moments are full of dance. Then
these ordinary people are no more ordinary people; they turn into gods
and goddesses. The moment you accept your being you accept everybody’s
being.</p><p><br></p><p>Why has this happened at all in the first place? And why only to man?
Why not to the trees and the birds and the animals? Why are the
Himalayan peaks so beautiful, and why are the birds on the wing so
enchanting, and why do the trees have such splendor? Why has this
disappeared from man’s life? There is a reason, and it has to be
understood.</p><p><br></p><p>Man is the only conscious being on the earth; that is his glory and
that is his agony too. It depends on you whether it will be agony or
glory. Consciousness is a double-edged sword. You have been given
something so valuable that you don’t know what to do with it; it is
almost like a sword in the hands of a child. The sword can be used
rightly, can protect, but the sword can harm too. Anything that can
become a blessing can also become a curse; it depends how you use
it.</p><p><br></p><p>Man is the only conscious being, and consciousness has two
possibilities: either it can become God- consciousness – then it is a
benediction, or it can become self-consciousness – then it is a curse.
And we have made it a curse. We have changed our consciousness into
self-consciousness, we have created an ego out of being conscious.
Rather than becoming aware of the organic unity of existence, rather
than becoming aware of the orgasmic joy of existence, rather than
becoming part of the universal, we have used our consciousness in
separating ourselves from the universe, from existence, from life.
Rather than making a bridge out of consciousness we have made a
wall.</p><p>And that’s what we are being taught continuously. Even modern
psychology goes on teaching a very nonsense thing: that ego needs to be
strengthened, that a man needs a strong ego because he has to fight in
the struggle of life; if he has not got a strong ego he will be defeated
by other strong egos. There is a point in it, it is true: if you don’t
have a strong ego you cannot be a politician, if you don’t have a strong
ego you cannot become very rich. You will have to fight tooth and nail
for these things, you will have to fight madly, neurotically,
fanatically. You will have to fight, utterly blind to what is happening.
You have to go on rushing into the crowd, you have to risk everything;
only then can you have much money, much power. But what is the point of
having much money and much power?</p><p><br></p><p>In the first place they are not really needed to be happy, they are
not really needed to be contented. Modern psychology goes on teaching
people to have strong egos. Modern psychology in fact is still not yet
modern, not modern enough; it is still persisting in the old ideology,
the old ideas. It has a very long heritage; it has not been yet able to
disconnect itself from the past. What the priests were saying in the
past, now the psychologist is saying. He is simply repeating the same,
with a new jargon of course, with more scientific terminology, which is
dangerous. The priest is exposed now, the priest no longer has any
power; the power has moved to the psychoanalyst, psychiatrist,
psychologist. The psychologist is the modern priest, and he is doing the
same stupid thing as the priests have been doing down the ages: “Have
strong egos.” The whole of education is based in giving you a strong
ego.</p><p>And the problem is that the more strong an ego you have the more you
are disconnected with existence, because the more you feel you are
separate, the more you ARE separate. And to remain separate from
existence creates fear, creates paranoia.</p><p>Why are people so afraid of death? Do you think they are really
afraid of death? You may not have meditated over it. Nobody is afraid of
death – because how can you be afraid of something which you have not
seen yet? You cannot be afraid of something which is unknown, you can
only be afraid of something which is known. A child is not afraid of
catching hold of a snake, a child is not afraid of</p><p><br></p><p>putting his hand into the fire. Why is he not afraid?because he does
not know! How can he be afraid of the snake? He has no past experience,
no bitter experience. How can he be afraid of the flame? – he has never
been burned before. How can you be afraid of death? You don’t know
anything about death. Who knows? It may be a beautiful rest. Who knows?
It may take you to a higher plane of life. Who knows? It may give you
freedom from your body. Who knows? How can you be afraid of death? No,
nobody is afraid of death; let me say it clearly.</p><p><br></p><p>But you will say everybody IS afraid of death, I know. There is
something else in it: people are NOT afraid of death, they are afraid of
losing their separation, they are afraid of losing their ego. Once you
start feeling separate from existence the fear of death arises because
then death seems to be dangerous. You will no longer be separate; what
will happen to your ego, your personality? And you have cultivated the
personality with such care, with such great effort; you have polished it
your whole life, and death will come and destroy it.</p><p><br></p><p>If you understand, if you see, if you can feel and experience that
you are not separate from existence, that you are one with it, all fear
of death disappears because there is nobody to die inside you. In the
first place there is nobody at all, existence lives through you.</p><p><br></p><p>Saint Paul says, “Not I, but Christ lives through me.” And Christ
says, “Not I, but God lives through me.” They are expressing their
non-separation, they are declaring that they are one with existence.
Once you know that you are one with existence there is no death
possible. For death to be possible first you have to create a private,
personal life; then death becomes possible. YOU MAKE DEATH POSSIBLE by
creating the ego; and the stronger the ego, the more will be the fear of
death. Hence the most egoistic person is very very prone... deep down,
trembling, afraid of death. The less the ego the less the fear of
death.</p><p>That’s why small children are not afraid of death – their egos are
not yet born. Animals are not afraid of death, they simply die; when
death comes they die. When birth comes they are here, when death comes
they are gone.</p><p><br></p><p>A person of true consciousness will come like the wind and will go
like the wind. He will not leave any traces anywhere. He will not
struggle with death, because he will not struggle with life itself. He
will allow life to flow through him and he will allow death also to flow
through him. Life is God’s and death is God’s; life is a manifestation,
death is a rest.</p><p><br></p><p>And remember, if the fear of death disappears then all other fears
disappear automatically, because all other fears are nothing but
by-products of the main, basic fear – the fear of death. Go into any of
your fears and ultimately you will come to the rock-bottom, and that
will be the fear of death. You are afraid of losing money? Go deep into
it and you will find that money somehow gives you a feeling that you are
more protected, that you can resist death more than the poor man; hence
you are afraid of losing money. If you are powerful, politically
powerful, it gives you an appearance, as if you have conquered death.
Because you are so powerful over people’s lives, it creates an illusion
that you are powerful over your life too. It is a SHEER illusion, but it
is maintained by your high post: you are the president, the prime
minister, and millions of people look up to you – you are so important,
how can existence afford to lose you? You are so important, how can life
continue without you? You are so important that you will be needed; that
gives you the feeling. Also, because you are so powerful over people,
you can kill thousands of people.</p><p><br></p><p>Adolf Hitler killed millions of people, and those who have looked
deeply into his mind are all convinced of one fact: that he was very
much afraid of death. He was afraid of death, so much so that he never
allowed anybody to be in his room in the night, not even the woman that
he had fallen in love with once. Nobody was ever allowed to stay in the
same room. He would lock the room, check everything, because while he
was asleep somebody could kill him. Who knows? – the woman he had fallen
in love with may be just a spy. He never allowed anybody to come close
to him, too close, he was so much afraid.</p><p><br></p><p>He got married only three hours before he was going to commit
suicide; there was not even a chance for the honeymoon. In fact that was
his honeymoon – suicide. In the middle of the night the priest was
called to marry him to the woman he had been in a kind of relationship
with – it could not have been of love, because a man like Hitler cannot
love. They were married, and the next thing they did after marriage was
that they killed themselves. Now there was no fear, he could allow the
woman to come close – he was going to commit suicide anyway. All was
lost, the game was lost, the enemy had entered into the capital. He
could hear the bombs exploding just close by; now there was no hope, he
had failed. Now he could get married. For what? For twenty years he had
been waiting, for twenty years the woman had been waiting, but he was so
afraid of bringing anybody too close.</p><p><br></p><p>This man killed millions of people for stupid reasons. He killed
Jews, MILLIONS of Jews, with this stupid idea: that it was because of
the Jews that Germany – the race, the country, the nation – had fallen
low; because of Jews the First World War had been lost. Now these are
all stupid reasons, with no logic, no relevance. Jews had nothing to do
with the First World War, they had nothing to do with the fall of the
German race. Really, they had given the greatest geniuses that Germany
has ever known: Karl Marx was a Jew, Sigmund Freud was a Jew, Albert
Einstein was a Jew. In fact it was the Jews who were the cream, but he
killed millions of Jews.</p><p>Deep down, it seems he was suffering from an inferiority complex. And
deep down he was suffering from so much fear of death that he wanted to
kill to convince himself that “If I kill so many people, if I can kill
millions of people, then I am beyond death. I am so powerful.”</p><p><br></p><p>A man who is afraid of death is dangerous, dangerous to himself and
to others. And the fear arises out of a very fallacious beginning; the
fallacy is that we think we are separate. But consciousness has that
possibility. Man has been given such a potential power of being
conscious that he has to be very careful how he uses it. Remember, if
you move on plain ground there is no danger of falling; if you move in
the mountains, if you go towards the peaks, there is great danger of
falling. The higher you move, the danger becomes</p><p><br></p><p>more and more acute. Man is the only animal who is moving higher, at
the peaks, towards the peaks. Consciousness is the mountain and we have
to be very alert.</p><p><br></p><p>And that is the whole teaching of all the Buddhas and all the
Krishnas and all the Christs, and that is the teaching of Kabir: be
conscious, be so conscious that you don’t create the self, be so alert
that the self is not created at all. Self-consciousness is a dis-ease.
Just consciousness is great freedom, liberation. By being just
conscious, sooner or later you will become God-conscious. By becoming
self- conscious, sooner or later you will lose even that small
consciousness that lingers behind the self like a small tail; that
consciousness will also disappear.</p><p><br></p><p>The ego will make you more and more unconscious. The ego will enclose
you like a prison wall. It will not leave even windows in your being to
look out through. It will make you a monad, a windowless, closed cell;
you will be encapsulated by the ego. It is the ego that is the
problem.</p><p><br></p><p>And hence I repeat again: the male mind is egoistic. You have to
learn the way of the feminine, you have to become egoless, you have to
learn the path of surrender. You have to learn how to melt into
existence, how to become one with the rivers and the mountains and the
clouds, how to feel affinity, attunement, at-onement. And then slowly,
slowly you become a host. The day you are a host, the Guest comes.</p><p>God is not a hypothesis; religion does not propose any hypotheses.
The hypothesis is part of the scientific world. A hypothesis means just
an assumption to explain a few facts which cannot be explained without
it. But a hypothesis is. always temporary: tomorrow we will find a
better hypothesis, then we will discard this one. Hence science goes on
discarding every day; better and better hypotheses are found and older
ones are discarded. Now Newton is discarded because of Einstein, Sooner
or later we will find a better hypothesis to explain the facts of the
world. A hypothesis is just a way of explaining the facts; it is
man-made. Facts are there and the mind wants to fix all those facts into
a certain system because unless they are put into a certain system the
mind feels uneasy, restless. Unless they are systematized, categorized,
the mind feels very restless.</p><p><br></p><p>The mind is a great systematizer, it wants to systematize everything.
Even when there is no system available, it invents one. The hypothesis
is an invention of the mind, but all the time you know that it is only
an assumption. You need not believe in a hypothesis, you only use the
hypothesis.</p><p>God is not a hypothesis.</p><p><br></p><p>Then what is God? God is a hypostasis; it is an experience. It is not
to explain anything, it is the experience of the unexplainable. I call
it hypostasis; it cannot be changed, it is absolute, and it is not a
belief. Those who believe in God, their God is a hypothesis; those who
know God, their God is not a hypothesis but a hypostasis.</p><p><br></p><p>Kabir knows. What he is talking about is not an explanation, what he
is talking about is an experience – he is sharing his joy, he is sharing
something that he has known, he is singing the song about the unsung.
Remember it, that whenever Kabir talks about God it is not a belief; he
knows it, it is his experience. Hc is talking out of his experience,
hence he can be of immense help to you.</p><p><br></p><p>Those who believe cannot be of any help; they themselves don’t know.
If somebody says, “I believe in God,” remember, he cannot be of any help
to you. He himself is ignorant, hence the belief Find a man who says, “I
know God. This is not my belief, but my experience.” And the miracle is:
if you know God, you are God. Knowing God, one becomes God. The old
Upanishads say: Knowing God, one becomes that.</p><p><br></p><p>Kabir is talking as a God-realized man, utterly drunk. His songs are
songs of a drunkard drunk on the divine, small, but of immense beauty.
They may not be great literature – they are not – because he does not
bother about the meter and the grammar and the language. These are not
composed songs, these are outpourings of his joy; a drunkard dancing,
singing. You can’t expect formalities to be fulfilled. These songs are
very small gems. The quantity is not the question, but the quality.</p><p><br></p><p>The original song begins:</p><p><br></p><p>SAI BIN DARD KAREJE HOY...</p><p><br></p><p>Without the beloved my heart aches, without the beloved my heart is
nothing but pain, without the beloved I am living in hell.</p><p>SAI BIN DARD KAREJE HOY...</p><p><br></p><p>Without the beloved we are empty, hollow: negatives. Unless God
enters into our beings, unless God blooms in our beings, we cannot be
REALLY existential, we remain shadows. And it is painful, it aches, it
hurts, it is like a wound.</p><p><br></p><p>WHEN MY FRIEND IS AWAY FROM ME, I AM DEPRESSED; NOTHING IN THE
DAYLIGHT DELIGHTS ME,</p><p>SLEEP AT NIGHT GIVES NO REST. WHO CAN I TELL ABOUT THIS?</p><p>The helplessness of the mystic! On the one hand he has tasted
something of God, he has seen a glimpse; now he hankers for more, now he
does not want to leave that experience, that space, even for a single
moment. But one cannot take hold of that space in one go. The experience
is so tremendous, so huge, so enormous, that you cannot swallow it. You
have slowly, slowly to imbibe it, you have to chew it and digest it.</p><p>God is an ocean – you cannot drink Him. You will have to slowly,
slowly become one with it.</p><p><br></p><p>Kabir knows, he has seen the face of the beloved. Now his heart is
full of pain, the pain of separation. He has known the state of
non-separation, maybe only for a few moments; for a few moments he has
been transported to another world, he has tasted the nectar. Now he is
back in the world, back to the earth, and it is very painful. The world
seems to be pale, utterly meaningless, with no significance. His heart
longs for the beloved, there is only one thirst – again to be in that
vast space, again to be with the Friend.</p><p><br></p><p>WHEN MY FRIEND IS AWAY FROM ME, I AM DEPRESSED; NOTHING IN THE
DAYLIGHT DELIGHTS ME.</p><p><br></p><p>Once you have known God then these so-called days are like nights.
Once you have known God then this life is like death. Once you have
known God then all the joys of this life are nothing but sorrows.
Everything that you had thought before as very sweet turns sour; now you
can compare.</p><p><br></p><p>If you have been to the Himalayan peaks and if you have seen that
virgin silence, the coolness, the smell of the snow, that other-worldly
something which still exists in the Himalayas... It is not so in the
Alps; no other mountains have that, all other mountains are already
polluted by man, all</p><p><br></p><p>other mountains are already destroyed by man. Only the Himalayan
peaks still have something very primitive, primordial, ancient, virgin.
If you have seen that silence, then coming back to the marketplace, the
heart longs... Nobody will be able to understand why you look so sad,
nobody will be able to understand why your eyes are so full of tears,
nobody will be able to understand why you don’t enjoy.</p><p><br></p><p>To the man who has tasted God, the world becomes so futile, so
utterly futile that he is here but he is not here; his heart
continuously longs for God.</p><p>NOTHING IN THE DAYLIGHT DELIGHTS ME, SLEEP AT NIGHT GIVES NO
REST.</p><p><br></p><p>To know God is to know ultimate rest. Your sleep is not much of a
rest. If you have known something of meditation you will understand what
I mean when I say your sleep is not much of a rest. Your sleep is a new
kind of restlessness, that’s all; it is good for a change. In the day
you are restless in one way, in the night you are restless in another
way – good for a change! It is a kind of rest. It is like you have been
doing mathematics for three hours and you are tired, then you go into
the garden and you dig a hole – it is a kind of rest. In fact it is a
new kind of work, but now, tired of mathematics, digging the hole feels
good.</p><p>That’s why in the schools, colleges, universities, we go on changing
subjects; it is a kind of rest: one hour for mathematics, then another
hour for geography, then another hour for history. We go on changing,
because the part of the mind that functions when you are working on
mathematics is not the part which functions when you are studying
literature. There are different parts, different centers in the mind, so
if one center starts functioning, the first center goes to sleep, has a
kind of rest.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s exactly what happens in the night. In the daytime your
conscious mind functions and your unconscious remains hidden. In the
night the conscious mind goes to sleep, the unconscious functions, but
work continues, great work really, much work. Your blood circulates,
work continues; your heart beats, work continues; your breathing
continues, your digestion continues. A thousand and one things are going
on in the body, and a thousand and one things are going on in the mind
too. Dreams upon dreams are coming; and not only that, a part of your
mind prevents everything from the outside, keeps it blocked so it does
not disturb your sleep.</p><p>You want to get up early in the morning, at four o’clock; you fix the
alarm and the alarm goes, but your mind is constantly working. It does
not want you to be disturbed. The mind creates a dream: you start
dreaming that you are passing a church and the church bells are
ringing.… Now this is a way for the mind to protect your sleep. It
misinforms you, misguides you, it changes the alarm into church bells.
Great work is going on! The mind is guarding, seeing what has to be
allowed and what has not to be allowed. And if something cannot be
prevented, at least it can be interpreted in such a way that the sleep
is not disturbed. It is constantly on guard, great work continues the
whole night.</p><p>But if you have known meditation, then a few minutes of meditation
can give you so much rest. Then your whole night will look like
restlessness compared to that rest, because in meditation you are
utterly relaxed, mind is not on guard, you are not focusing on anything.
You are simply open and available, available to all kinds of things –
the birds singing, the airplane passing by, the train, the</p><p><br></p><p>people, the traffic noise. You are available to all. Meditation is
not concentration, meditation is not excluding anything; meditation is
inclusive of all.</p><p><br></p><p>And then there is a great silence amidst all the noise around you,
great rest amidst all the turmoil around you. Once you have known the
rest of meditation even for few minutes, your whole night will look like
restlessness. Comparison will arise. But one who has known God – that
means one who has known SAMADHI, the ultimate peak of meditation... It
is natural, Kabir is right:</p><p><br></p><p>NOTHING IN THE DAYLIGHT DELIGHTS ME, SLEEP AT NIGHT GIVES NO
REST.</p><p>WHO CAN I TELL ABOUT THIS?</p><p><br></p><p>This is one of the greatest problems for the mystics: “Who can I tell
about this, who will understand?”</p><p><br></p><p>I was travelling in this country for fifteen years, day in, day out,
year in, year out, talking to thousands of people. Slowly, slowly I
became aware that I was talking to walls. These people could not
understand what I was saying. They could hear, but they could not
listen. The words reached them but the meaning was left behind. I tried
in every way, but it was impossible. Then I had to decide to stay in one
place and only to talk to those few who really wanted to understand –
and not only to understand, but who were ready to be transformed.</p><p><br></p><p>Many people come here, particularly Indians, and they ask, “Why isn’t
the meeting open to all?” Because it is of no use to them, and they will
be a nuisance here. Their very presence will destroy something immensely
beautiful that is being created. It is open only to those who are
seekers. It is not a public place, it can NEVER be a public place. It is
a mystery school: it is only for those who are ready to go into the
unknown, the unexplainable.</p><p>And this has been my experience: that if I am talking to my
sannyasins I feel a deep rapport, if I am talking to nonsannyasins
something seems to be difficult to communicate. Many non-sannyasins have
asked, “Why can’t we sit in front?” For the simple reason that if you
are in front and I see you, it will be difficult for me to say that
which I would like to say. Just looking at your faces, something becomes
impossible, communication becomes difficult – what to say about
communion? Looking at my sannyasins, looking into their eyes, communion
is possible.</p><p><br></p><p>Kabir is right. He says:</p><p><br></p><p>WHO CAN I TELL ABOUT THIS? KASE KAHUN DUKH HOY.…</p><p>There is great pain in my heart because I have known the bliss of
being with the divine, but to whom can I communicate this? It would help
me if I could communicate.</p><p>Hence a Buddhafield is always needed, SATSANG is needed. A community
is needed where many people are searching together, where you can say
and you can rest assured that you will not be</p><p><br></p><p>misunderstood. A commune is needed where you can share your burdens,
your experiences; you can pour out your heart and you will be
understood, and you will not feel embarrassed.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what is happening here. If a sannyasin comes to another
sannyasin, starts crying, the other understands, the other will not
start asking questions, questions which will be embarrassing to the
person who is crying. He may hug him, he may hold his hand, but he will
not start a great discussion about it: “Don’t be emotional, this is not
good. Be a man, don’t cry!” No, he will understand, he will have all
sympathy, he will support. A commune becomes a support where you can say
things which are not ordinarily said in the outside world, where you can
share experiences which look imaginary, illusory, hallucinatory, where
you can share things which if you go in the outside world and tell
somebody, he will think you are mad.</p><p>KASE KAHUN DUKH HOY..</p><p><br></p><p>Kabir says: I cannot find anybody to whom I can say this – that I
have seen my Lord, that I have been with my Lord, and now I am again
separated. I have known non-separation, those orgasmic moments, those
peaks, and now I am thrown back into the dark valley. Now nothing here
appeals to to me anymore; the beauty here is almost ugliness compared to
the beauty that has arisen in my vision. And the happiness here is just
false, because I have known the authentic joy. And all the celebrations
here are just formal, people are moving in empty gestures. I have seen
the real celebration!</p><p><br></p><p>THE NIGHT IS DARK AND LONG... HOURS GO BY... BECAUSE I AM ALONE, I
SIT UP SUDDENLY, FEAR GOES THROUGH ME.…</p><p><br></p><p>THE NIGHT IS DARK AND LONG.… You don’t know about what night Kabir is
talking. He is not talking about the ordinary night, he is talking about
the night that is known only by those who have seen the light – a very
paradoxical phenomenon. He is talking about the night that happens only
to those who have seen the dawn, who have seen something of the morning,
and again that has disappeared and now the night is darker than ever
before. Great fear arises: “Will I ever be able to attain to that peak
again? Was that real? Or had I only been dreaming?” Great fear grows,
great trembling arises, one is scared to death. And one cannot even
share it. It would have helped if there were a companion with whom it
was possible to share. It would have helped if some consoling words from
the other had come; if the other had told him, “Don’t be worried, it
will happen again. It has happened to me again.” That would have given
confidence. But whom to say it to?</p><p><br></p><p>KASE KAHUN DUKH HOY!</p><p><br></p><p>I am in tremendous pain. But where to go, whom to go to, with whom to
share? ADHI RATIYAN PICHHLE PAHARVA, SAI BINA TARAF RAHI SOY.</p><p><br></p><p>Half the night is gone, waiting, waiting, waiting, and there is no
sign! I cannot hear His footsteps! ADHI RATIYAN PICHHLE PAHARVA, SAI
BINA TARAF RAHI SOY.</p><p><br></p><p>I have waited long, half the night has passed. Now even the last part
of the night is passing and He has not come, and I don’t see any sign,
any indication, any message. And the darkness is becoming darker and
darker; there seems to be no possibility that I will attain to Him
again. In deep despair, in great pain, I have fallen asleep again.</p><p><br></p><p>THE NIGHT IS DARK, AND LONG...</p><p><br></p><p>Remember one thing: that time is relative. If you are in a mood of
rejoicing time goes fast, very fast; if you are in misery, in pain, time
slows down. The clock moves the same, but the psychological experience
of time is very relative.</p><p><br></p><p>You are sitting by the side of a person who is dying – then you will
know how long the night becomes: there seems to be no end to it. You are
with your beloved, after many years you have met, and the night goes so
fast, as if it were just a few moments. You cannot believe how fast it
has gone. It seems the night played a game with you – it went fast –
just not to allow you time enough to be with the beloved.</p><p>Time is relative, not the clock time but psychological time. Those
who have known glimpses of God, for them this world is really difficult
to live in, and the night is very dark and very long. The Christian
mystics have a right word for it; they call it’the dark night of the
soul’.</p><p><br></p><p>... HOURS GO BY... BECAUSE I AM ALONE...</p><p><br></p><p>And you will know real aloneness only when you have seen God. Before
that you have known aloneness – sometimes your friend is not with you,
your wife is not with you, your husband is not with you, your children
are not with you – yes, you have known a certain kind of aloneness,. but
that is nothing compared to the aloneness that you will know when you
have seen God. Then that aloneness is like a knife in the heart. One is
almost crucified.</p><p>I SIT UP SUDDENLY, FEAR GOES THROUGH ME..</p><p><br></p><p>I cannot sleep because He may be coming. Who knows when He will come?
His ways are unpredictable, He comes at very unexpected moments. One has
to be alert and watchful. So I wake up, I sit up suddenly again and
again, and fear goes through me: “He has not come. Has He forgotten me?
Has He lost interest in me?”</p><p>These are the fears of a lover – tremendously magnified, infinitely
magnified, when the lover is nobody except God Himself, nobody other
than God Himself.</p><p><br></p><p>KABIR SAYS: LISTEN, MY FRIEND</p><p>THERE IS ONE THING IN THE WORLD THAT SATISFIES, AND THAT IS A MEETING
WITH THE GUEST.</p><p><br></p><p>Nothing else ever satisfies, Nothing else can ever satisfy. Without
attaining to God, without becoming God, without merging with God, you
are going to remain discontented. Contentment, real contentment, has
only one meaning: that is the meeting with the Guest.</p><p><br></p><p>KAHAT KABIR SUNO BHAI PYARE...</p><p><br></p><p>My dear friends, listen. SAI MILE SUKH HOY.</p><p>There is only one possibility of bliss, and that is when the beloved
has been found. And what is the way to find the beloved? Search is not
the way. Lao Tzu says, “Seek, and you wi]l not find. Do not seek, and
find.” Seeking is not the way, because seeking is again the male mind.
Non-seeking, a passive waiting, just ready, the door open, the house
prepared for the Guest, sitting on the doorstep, waiting...</p><p>This waiting is prayer, this waiting is meditation. This waiting is
what is meant by being a host. The moment you have become a host the
Guest comes, inevitably comes; it has never been otherwise. It is not
that you have to find God; if you are ready, God finds you. And how cam
you find God? – you don’t know His address, you don’t know where He is,
you don’t know His face. Even if you come across Him you will not be
able to recognize Him. Even if you meet Him the meeting is not going to
be any meeting because you will not recognize Him. How can you recognize
Him? You have never seen Him before.</p><p><br></p><p>Man cannot seek God: this is the message of these sutras. God can
seek Man.</p><p>Then what has to be done by man? He should be ready, he should be
available. If a hand comes from the beyond he should not shrink back. If
a voice comes from the beyond he should be ready to listen. If his mind
is noisy he will not be able to listen to it. And if He comes and knocks
on your door, you should be ready to open the door, you should not be
afraid of Him. Yes, when the unknown comes fear arises, and when God
knocks on your door it is a death for you... and a resurrection – but
the resurrection will come later on. First the crucifixion, first you
will have to die.</p><p><br></p><p>Being with God means only one thing: dissolving in Him, just as
rivers come from the mountains and disappear into the ocean. Maybe there
is a moment when the river hesitates. Kahlil Gibran says somewhere: I
have watched rivers falling into the ocean and I think that for a moment
they hesitate, for a moment the fear grips them – the vast ocean, and
the river is going to lose its identity, and forever. Kahlil Gibran
says: I have seen rivers looking back with great nostalgia at all the
mountains that they have crossed, and the plains, and the beautiful
trees on the banks, and the sunrises and the sunsets, and a thousand and
one things. There is great nostalgia for all the memories and a great
desire not to lose one’s identity, but the river cannot go back.</p><p><br></p><p>Man can go back, that is the problem. The river is bound to fall into
the ocean, but man can turn back even from the ultimate door. If fear
grips you and you become too protective of your separate existence, of
your personality, of your ego, if you have really a strong ego, you may
turn back or you may close your doors. You may not listen to the voice
of the beyond.</p><p><br></p><p>And let me tell you, God comes every day and knocks on your doors.
Sometimes He comes as the wind and knocks on your doors, but you don’t
open your doors. And sometimes He comes in the rains, but you don’t go
into the open and you don’t stand under the sky to be soaked by Him. No,
you hide, you open your umbrellas. And you have psychological umbrellas
too, and whenever He comes you avoid, whenever He comes across you, you
escape.</p><p><br></p><p>Kabir says: If you want the Guest, be a host. Welcome Him, receive
Him, embrace Him. And He always comes, continuously comes – every moment
of your life He is coming and searching for you; you go on avoiding. All
that is needed on your part is not a search for God-but availability –
when God comes to be ready to surrender, when the ocean comes to
disappear into it. Slip like a dewdrop... silently, prayerfully.
Dancing, laughing, loving, disappear.</p><p>SAI MILE SUKH HOY KAHAT KABIR SUNO BHAI PYARE.</p><p><br></p><p>My beloved friends, listen. This is all that I have to say, says
Kabir: That there is no other bliss except the meeting with the
Guest.</p><p><br></p><p>C H A P T E R 2</p><p><br></p><p>T h e t i m e h a s c o m e t o b e f r e e</p><p><br></p><p>2 7 A p r i l 1 9 7 9 a m i n B u d dh a H a l l</p><p><br></p><p>The first question:</p><p><br></p><p>OSHO, SOMETHING INSIDE ME CRINGES WITH DISTRUST WHEN I HEAR YOU SAY
‘GOD’, AND I NOTICE THAT I AM RELUCTANT TO EMBRACE THE WORD. LOVE, YES;
DIVINE PRESENCE, YES; THE ULTIMATE, YES; BUT THIS WORD ‘GOD’ BRINGS A
HESITATION TO MY LIPS AND A SHUDDER TO MY BEING. WILL YOU COMMENT ON
THIS CONDITION?</p><p><br></p><p>Charles Harp,</p><p>THERE is a reason in it: in the name of God so much harm has been
done that it is natural. This will happen to any intelligent person. The
word ‘god’ has become very dirty; remaining in the wrong company of the
priests it has lost all its beauty. It has become associated with wrong
people, wrong meanings. Hence it is very natural that a shudder goes
into your being, that a hesitation arises in you, that you cringe with
distrust – but it has nothing to do with the word ‘god’.</p><p><br></p><p>The word ‘god’ in itself is beautiful, the word ‘god’ in itself is
innocent.</p><p><br></p><p>The same has been done in the name of religion, the same has been
done in the name of love. If you look at the history of the word ‘love’,
millions of people have been killed. Christians have been killing in the
name of love, Mohammedans have been killing in the name of religion,
God, brotherhood. And the same has been the case all over the world.</p><p><br></p><p>Now the same is happening in the name of communism. The word is
beautiful, it comes from</p><p>‘commune’. The same is happening in the name of democracy; the word
is beautiful.</p><p><br></p><p>So one thing has to be understood: words in themselves are innocent;
it depends on what you do with them. And if you have used the word ‘god’
wrongly, who can prevent you from using the word ‘love’ in the same way?
Brotherhood, democracy, communism, humanity, peace? In the name of peace
only war happens, and preparation for war. Then one has to understand
one thing: one need not become too conditioned for or against words;
words are neutral.</p><p>The word ‘god’ itself has tremendous beauty. It comes from a Greek
root in which g stands for ‘that’, o stands for ‘which’, d stands
for’is’. God is a code word; it means ‘that which is’. Now it contains
all – the trees and the birds and the clouds and the sun, you and me –
all that has happened, all that is happening, all that will ever
happen.</p><p><br></p><p>God does not mean a person. Yes, it has been used in that way, but
what does that have to do with the poor word ‘god’? The word cannot
prevent people from wrongly using it. It has been used as if there is an
old man, very ancient, sitting in heaven, dominating, controlling – a
great engineer who has created the world. The word itself does not have
any meaning of that kind. It simply means the whole, the total.</p><p><br></p><p>And the whole IS; nobody can deny it, not even the atheist. The
atheist can deny God as a person, but there is no God as a person so the
atheist is fighting with a shadow – just like the theist who is
worshipping a shadow. The theist is stupid, so is the atheist. They are
in the same boat. One is worshipping something which is not, the other
is criticizing, fighting with something which is not. Both are engaged
in an exercise in futility. God means the whole, the total, the all.</p><p>It will be good if you can free the word ‘god’ from the so-called
religious people. The word in itself is beautiful and has to be saved.
Hence I go on using it, knowing that it has been associated with the
wrong people. But it is not the fault of the word ‘god’; it is helpless.
You can use any word wrongly, and almost all beautiful words have been
used wrongly. Only beautiful ones can be wrongly used, remember, because
they can become a camouflage. Hiding behind them, you can do wrong
things more easily. ‘God’ becomes the screen and behind it you can be as
violent as possible – hiding behind a beautiful word: ‘love’ can serve,
‘humanity’ can serve...</p><p>If this is the way, Charles, and you become antagonistic towards
words, then not a single beautiful word will be left for you; all have
been used wrongly. And even if we invent new words, they will be used
wrongly because the people, the great crowd on the earth, are the same.
Its mind is the same.</p><p><br></p><p>Now in Russia nobody believes in God, but they believe in communism.
They will do the same in the name of communism as Christians have done
in the name of God. What is the difference? In Russia nobody believes in
the Bible, but they will sacrifice as many people at the altar of DAS
KAPITAL as have been sacrificed in the name of the Bible. So what is the
difference? Kaaba or Kremlin, there seems to be no difference at
all.</p><p>Now in China nobody believes in Buddha and nobody can commit any more
crimes in the name of Buddha, but now the same crimes are being
committed in the name of communism, Chairman Mao, because the people are
the same. Unless the mind of humanity changes this is going to
happen.</p><p><br></p><p>Hence I don’t drop using the word ‘god’, knowing perfectly well that
you are not alone – there are many people who would like me to drop the
word ‘god’ completely, but then I will have to drop ‘love’ too.</p><p><br></p><p>You say, “LOVE, YES<span class=s5></span>” That simply means that
you are not aware that what has been done in the</p><p>name of love is not less criminal than what has been done in the name
of God. “DIVINE PRESENCE” – you say, “YES” but the same can be done;
“THE ULTIMATE, YES.” These are just synonyms! Life, love, God,
godliness, divine presence, the ultimate, the absolute, truth – they are
all synonyms.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t be too conditioned by the past. This is remaining in a kind of
bondage, Charles. Somebody hearing the word ‘god’ simply falls on his
knees and starts praying, and somebody else cringes. Both are
conditioned, nobody is free. If you shudder, if you hesitate, then the
word ‘god’ has immense power over you, negative of course – but it has
great power, as much power as it has on the people who go to the
churches and the temples. You are conditioned in the negative way, they
are conditioned in the positive way. But conditioning is conditioning;
whether negative or positive it does not make you free.</p><p>Be free! And by being free, free these beautiful words too. Hence I
go on using the word ‘god’. But to me God is synonymous with love, love
is synonymous with life, life is synonymous with existence – these are
synonyms. And we have to claim these beautiful words back from the
priests and the politicians.</p><p><br></p><p>The second question:</p><p><br></p><p>PLEASE OSHO, WHAT IS TIME?</p><p><br></p><p>Mado Maestracci,</p><p><br></p><p>TIME has two meanings. One is chronological time, the clock’s time. I
cannot say much about it. You have to ask a physicist; only he can say
something about it. That is not my dimension of work. If you ask the
physicists, Albert Einstein and others, they will say time is the fourth
dimension of space. But that does not make much sense, the mystery
remains. The mystery remains as mysterious as it was before Albert
Einstein.</p><p><br></p><p>Saint Augustine is reported to have said, “I know what time is if
nobody asks me; if somebody asks</p><p>me then I don’t know.”</p><p>Time is a mysterious quality. Everybody lives in it, everybody feels
it, everybody knows it, and yet it is inexplicable.</p><p>The physicist has come to a certain understanding – that it is the
fourth dimension of space – but that too does not demystify it. In fact
it becomes even more mysterious. We have never thought of space and time
as one; now physicists say that they are not two. They use a single word
for both: spatiotime.</p><p><br></p><p>But that is not my world, science is not my world. There is another
meaning of time, and whenever I use the word ‘time’ I use it in that
other sense – psychological time – which has significance, more
significance than chronological time.</p><p><br></p><p>What is psychological time? Mind is psychological time. Mind is time.
If you don’t have any mind and you are simply silent with no thought
moving within, there is no time for you, not psychological time. The
clock will go on moving, but for you the inner clock stops – time stops,
the world stops. That is my dimension, the dimension of meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>As you go deeper into meditation time disappears. When meditation has
really bloomed there is no time found. It happens simultaneously: when
the mind disappears time disappears. Hence down the ages the mystics
have said that time and mind are nothing but two aspects of the same
coin. Mind cannot live without time and time cannot live without mind.
Time is a way for the mind to exist.</p><p><br></p><p>Mind creates future through desire, through dreaming. The future does
not exist, it is only in imagination, and mind creates the past. The
past also does not exist, it is only in the memory. The past is no more,
the future is not yet, but both exist in the mind. And because of the
past and the future you have the feeling of time.</p><p><br></p><p>Time is not divided into three parts as it is usually divided.
Mystics divide time into two parts: the past and the future. Time has
only two tenses: past, future. And what about the present? Mystics say
the present is timeless because the present is mindless. When you are
utterly in the present, herenow, there is neither mind nor time. You
transcend time and mind both, you enter into eternity. You are beyond
time. You are in a totally different world – transformed, transmuted,
transported.</p><p><br></p><p>When I talk about time I mean this time that is created by the mind.
Mind clings with the past and clings with the future. It is not ready to
renounce the past, it is not ready to die to the past, because it is in
the past that it can have its roots. And it is not ready to renounce
desiring, dreaming, because it is in desiring and dreaming that it can
live. It needs space; it creates a very false space for itself:
tomorrow, which never comes. Mind knows of yesterdays and tomorrows, and
nothing of today.</p><p>Hence all the Buddhas have insisted, “Live in this moment.” To live
in this moment is meditation, to be simply herenow is meditation. Those
who are simply herenow this very moment with me are in meditation. This
is meditation: the cuckoo calling from far away, and the airplane
passing, and the crows and the birds. And all is silent, and there is no
movement in the mind – you are not thinking of the past and you are not
thinking of the future. Time has stopped, the world has stopped.</p><p><br></p><p>Stopping the world is the whole art of meditation. And to live in the
moment is to live in eternity. To taste the moment with no idea, with no
mind, is to taste immortality.</p><p><br></p><p>Time is mind. Time is death. Going beyond time is going beyond mind
and beyond death.</p><p><br></p><p>But if you want to know about chronological time you have to ask a
physicist; that is not my concern. Psychological time is my basic
concern. That’s my whole work here: to help you get out of psychological
time.</p><p>The third question:</p><p><br></p><p>WHAT IS GREED?</p><p><br></p><p>Sandesh,</p><p><br></p><p>GREED is an effort to stuff yourself with something – it may be sex,
it may be food, it may be money, it may be power. Greed is the fear of
inner emptiness. One is afraid of being empty and one wants somehow to
possess more and more things. One wants to go on stuffing things inside
so one can forget one’s emptiness.</p><p><br></p><p>But to forget one’s emptiness is to forget one’s real self. To forget
one’s emptiness is to forget the way to God. To forget one’s emptiness
is the most stupid act in the world that a man is capable of.</p><p>But why do people want to forget? We are carrying an idea given to us
by others that emptiness is death. It is not! It is a false notion
perpetuated by the society. Society has a deep investment in the idea,
because if people are not greedy THIS society cannot exist. If people
are not greedy then who is going to be mad after money, after power?
Then the whole structure of this power-oriented society will collapse.
If people are not greedy, who is going to call Alexander ‘the Great’?
Alexander will be called ‘the ridiculous’ not ‘the Great’, ‘the stupid’
not ‘the Great’. Then who is going to call the people who go on and on
possessing things respectable? Who is going to give them respect? They
will be the laughing-stock! They are mad, they are wasting their lives.
Then who is going to pay respects to the prime ministers and the
presidents of the countries? Then people will think that they are
neurotic.</p><p>And the world will be really beautiful when Adolf Hitler and
Mussolini and Churchill and people like these are thought to be
neurotic, when nobody pays any attention to them. The whole structure of
politics will fall, because the politician is there only to get more and
more attention. The politician is a child, he has not grown up. He wants
everybody to be at his disposal, he wants everybody to look up to him,
he wants everybody to go on being attentive, to pay attention to
him.</p><p>Attention gives one intoxication; it is the greatest drug in the
world. Just think of yourself passing through the whole town and nobody
paying any attention, not even a dog barking at you; everybody ignoring
you, even dogs; nobody taking any note, everybody thinking you are not!
How will you feel? You will feel very bad – nobody saying “Hi! Hello,
good morning. Where are you going? How are you?” – people simply not
looking at you. If you become invisible and you walk around, and nobody
looks at you because nobody can see you, and nobody says “Hello!”,
nobody pays any attention, how are you going to feel? You will feel like
a non-entity, a nobody, reduced to nothingness. It will look like
death.</p><p><br></p><p>Hence people are in search of more and more attention. If you cannot
get attention by being famous then at least you can get attention by
becoming notorious. If you cannot get attention by being a saint you can
get attention by being a murderer.</p><p><br></p><p>And psychologists say that basically many murderers commit murder not
for any reason other than to get attention. When they murder their
photos are on the front pages of newspapers, with their names in block
letters. They are on the TV, on the radio, everywhere; they become
somebody. At</p><p><br></p><p>least for a few days they can enjoy that they are also famous; the
whole world knows about them, they are not non-entities any more.</p><p><br></p><p>Just think of a world where people are not greedy – then the rich
person will be thought neurotic, the politician will be thought
neurotic. Then the people who are constantly hankering for attention
will be thought retarded. And if people are not greedy we will have a
totally different world, more beautiful. There will be fewer possessions
certainly, but more joy, more music, more dance, more love. People may
not have many gadgets in their houses, but people will be more alive.
Right now we go on selling our life energies for gadgets. Gadgets go on
accumulating and the soul goes on disappearing; machines go on growing
and man goes on disappearing.</p><p>When the world is non-greedy, people will be playing on the guitar,
on the flute. People may be sitting silently under trees, meditating.
Yes, people will be doing things but only to the extent that is
absolutely necessary. People will be fulfilling their needs, but needs
are not desires; desires are unnecessary, needs are necessary. And
desires never end. Needs are simple and can be fulfilled, but desires go
on asking for more and more. They-go on desiring for even more of the
same thing that you have. You have one car, the desire says have two;
unless you have a two-car garage you are nobody. You have one house,
desire says have two – at least one in the hills. And when you have two
the desire says have three, one in the hills, one on the seashore, and
so on, so forth.</p><p><br></p><p>Paddy was digging his garden one day, when he saw a little creature
at his feet. He lifted his shovel up to kill it, but to his surprise it
spoke.</p><p><br></p><p>“Paddy, I’m a leprechaun. Spare my life and I will grant ye three
wishes.”</p><p>“Three wishes? Done!” said Paddy, then thought: “Well, I am thirsty
from all this digging. I would like a bottle of cold Guinness.”</p><p>The leprechaun snapped his fingers and Paddy found he was holding a
bottle of Guinness.</p><p><br></p><p>“That there,” said the leprechaun, “is a magic bottle. It will never
empty – it will pour forever.” Paddy took a swig. Lovely. “What are your
next two wishes, Paddy?” asked the leprechaun</p><p>Paddy thought, “I think I would like two more of these, please.”</p><p><br></p><p>Now it is of no use, but that’s how it goes on<span class=s5></span>You have a million dollars – already you have more</p><p>than you can use but you are asking for more, and it is never ending.
Needs are small: yes, you need food, shelter, you need a few things.
Everybody’s needs can be provided for; the world has enough to fulfill
everybody’s needs; but desires... it is impossible. Desires cannot be
fulfilled. And because people are fulfilling their desires millions of
people’s needs are not fulfilled.</p><p>But basically greed is a spiritual problem. You have been taught that
if you don’t have many things you are nobody, and you are also afraid.
So people go on stuffing themselves. It does not help; at the most it
gives you a temporary relief, but sooner or later you start feeling the
emptiness again. Then you fill it again.</p><p>And the inner emptiness is the door to God. But you have been told
that the empty mind is the devil’s mind or the devil’s workshop; that is
absolute nonsense that has been told to people. The empty</p><p><br></p><p>mind is the door to God. How can the empty mind be the devil’s
workshop? It is in the empty mind</p><p>that the devil dies completely. The devil means the mind, the empty
mind means no-mind.</p><p><br></p><p>And greed is one of the most fundamental problems to be encountered.
You have to see why you are greedy: because you want to keep yourself
occupied with things. Possessing more and more you remain occupied,
engaged. You can forget all about your inner world, you can go on saying
to it, “Wait! Let me have this much more, and then I am going to turn
towards you.”</p><p>And it is always death that comes before your desires are fulfilled.
Even if you live for a thousand years your desires are not going to be
fulfilled.</p><p>In India we have a very beautiful story.</p><p><br></p><p>A great king, Yayati, was going to die. Death came It is an ancient
story; in those days things were</p><p>simple and the other world was not so far away. Death came and
knocked on the door. Yayati opened the door and he said, “What? I have
lived for only a hundred years, and here you are – and with no notice!
At least some time should be given. I have not fulfilled my real desires
yet. I have been postponing: tomorrow, tomorrow; and now you are here,
and there will be no tomorrow. This is cruel! Be kind!”</p><p><br></p><p>Death said, “I have to take somebody, I cannot go empty-handed. But
seeing your misery, your old</p><p>age, I will grant you a hundred years more. But then one of your sons
has to go with me.”</p><p><br></p><p>Yayati had one hundred sons – he had one hundred wives – so he said,
“That is simple!”</p><p><br></p><p>It was not so simple as he had thought. He called his hundred sons
and asked one to go. “Save your old father’s life! Many times you have
said, ‘Father, we can die for you.’ Now the time has come to prove
it!”</p><p>But these things are always said; they are polite nothings. The sons
started looking at each other. Somebody was seventy, somebody was
seventy-five, somebody was sixty; they themselves were getting very old.
The youngest was just twenty.</p><p><br></p><p>The youngest son stood up and he said, “I am ready to go.” Nobody
could believe it! His ninety-nine brothers could not believe it; they
thought he was a fool. And he had not lived yet, not at all. He was only
twenty, just on the threshold of the beginning. Even Death felt
compassion.</p><p><br></p><p>Death took the young man aside, whispered in his ear, “Are you a
fool? Your older brothers are not ready, they have lived long.
Seventy-five years somebody has lived – he is not ready. And you are
ready? Your father does not want to die. He is a hundred years old, and
you are only twenty.”</p><p>The young man said something very beautiful, something of tremendous
import. He said, “Seeing this, that my father has lived one hundred
years and he has ALL that one can have, and he is still not satisfied, I
see the futility of life. What is the point? I may live one hundred
years and the situation will be the same. And if it was only my father
then I would have thought, ‘Maybe he is an exception.’ But my brothers –
seventy-five, seventy, sixty-five, sixty – have also lived long. They
have enjoyed every kind of thing; now what else is there to enjoy? They
are getting old and they are not satisfied.</p><p><br></p><p>So one thing is certain: this is not the way to become satisfied.
Hence I am ready, and I am coming with you, not in any despair but in
tremendous understanding. I am coming with you with great cheerfulness
that I have not to pass through this torture, these one hundred years of
torture which my father has had to suffer. He has not yet become able
enough to go with you.”</p><p><br></p><p>And the story continues. One hundred years again passed; they came
and were gone, nothing was noticed. Again Death knocked. When Death
knocked, only then did Yayati become aware again that one hundred years
had passed. He said, “But I am not ready!”</p><p><br></p><p>And this went on happening, and each time a son went with Death, and
for one thousand years Yayati lived. This is really a symbolic story.
After one thousand years Death came, and Death said, “What do you think
now?”</p><p><br></p><p>Yayati said, “I am coming. Enough is enough! I have seen that nothing
can ever be fulfilled here. Desires go on growing; you fulfill one
desire and ten others arise. It is a process ad infinitum. Now I am
coming willingly, and now I can say that my first son who went with you
and was only twenty years old had intelligence. I was stupid. It took
one thousand years for me to see it and he could see it when he was only
twenty. That is intelligence!”</p><p>If you are intelligent you will see the futility of greed. If you are
intelligent you will start living rather than preparing to live. Greed
is preparing to live. And you can go on preparing, and the time to live
will never come. If you are intelligent you will not miss today for
tomorrow. You will not sacrifice this moment for another moment, you
will live this moment in its totality. You will squeeze the whole juice
out of this moment.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus says to his disciples, “Think not of the morrow.” He is simply
saying, “Don’t be greedy” – because whenever you think of the morrow you
become greedy. It is greed that thinks of the morrow. Jesus says to his
disciples: Look at the lily flowers in the field. What is their secret?
Why are they so beautiful? Even Solomon attired in all his grandeur was
not so beautiful. What is their secret? Their secret is simple: they
think not of the morrow, they live in the moment. This moment is all and
all. There is nothing behind, nothing ahead. They enjoy this moment with
their total being.</p><p>Greed means postponing your life for tomorrow.</p><p><br></p><p>Try to see your greed. It can take so many forms: it can be worldly,
it can be other-worldly. Beware! It may take the form of: “This life is
not worth living so I will prepare for another life. This earth is not
worth living on, I will prepare for paradise.” But this is greed!</p><p><br></p><p>Of your so-called saints ninety-nine percent are greedy people, far
more greedy than the people you will find in the marketplace. The greed
of the people who live in the marketplace is not that great, their greed
is very ordinary. They are asking for more money– that is very ordinary.
Your saints, your mahatmas say, “This is temporary. We ask for something
permanent, we want something eternal. We will sacrifice the temporal for
the eternal.” There is a great motivation; out of the corner of their
eyes they are waiting for paradise. There they will enjoy and there they
will show these fools who were rushing in the marketplace, “Look, we had
told you before, we had warned you. Now you have to suffer in hell, and
we will enjoy all the heavenly joys.” But this is greed, and wherever
greed is, there is no heaven. Greed is hell; it may be worldly, it may
be otherworldly.</p><p><br></p><p>See the stupidity of greed. I am not saying “Renounce” – watch my
words – I am saying see the stupidity of greed. In that very seeing it
disappears, and your energy is free. Your consciousness is no longer
entangled, entrapped, by things – money, power, prestige. Your
consciousness is free. And the freedom of consciousness is the greatest
rejoicing.</p><p><br></p><p>The fourth question:</p><p><br></p><p>WHY DON’T I FEEL THAT I AM MYSELF?</p><p><br></p><p>Gayatri,</p><p><br></p><p>BECAUSE you are not yet. Your feeling is indicative of a truth:
nobody is himself. Everybody is wearing a mask, everybody is pretending
to be somebody else. Your smile is painted, your face is not yours. You
are simply fulfilling others’ expectations. Your parents wanted you to
be this way, that’s why you are this way. Your teachers wanted you to be
like this, that’s why you are like this. Your society demands that you
are of a certain type and you simply fulfill it. You are a slave, you
are not your own being.</p><p><br></p><p>And so many demands have been made on you that you don’t have only
one mask, you have many, because in twenty-four hours’ time you have to
change many times. When you go to the office and you see the boss you
have to wear a different mask – smiling, wagging your tail. And when you
are facing your servant you have a totally different mask; now you
expect him to smile and wag his tail. You take revenge; what the boss
has done to you, you will do to your servant. He will go home and do the
same to his wife, and the wife will do the same to the kid, and the kid
will do the same to his toy... and this goes on and on. With the friend
you have one mask, with the stranger another; with the wife one and with
your girlfriend another.</p><p>And you have become so skillful that the masks slip and change of
their own accord. It has become almost an automatic process, and very
smooth. This is what your personality is.</p><p><br></p><p>Hence Gayatri, it is true that you don’t feel that you are your own
self This is the beginning of a great revolution in your life.</p><p>People think they are themselves. They are deceiving themselves or
they are living in an illusion. This is good to know, that “I am not
myself”, because this is the beginning. If you become very aware that
you are not yourself then sooner or later you will have to drop all
falsities. Then sooner or later you will have to assert your true
being.</p><p>An Irishman went for a job at a building site. The foreman told him,
“You can start at 7.30 a.m. on Monday morning.”</p><p><br></p><p>Paddy went back to his flat and told his mates, “You must get me up
at 7.00 a.m. on Monday morning, because oi start me new job at 7.30 a.m.
and oi mustn’t be late on the first morning.”</p><p>Monday morning arrived and before his mates woke him up, they painted
his hands and his face black.</p><p><br></p><p>“Paddy, get up. It’s 7.00 a.m.” He woke up, had his breakfast and
walked across the town to the</p><p>building site. The foreman went over to him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, what can I do for you?”</p><p>The Irishman said, “You gave me a job and told me to start this
morning.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I’m sorry, sir, there must be some mistake. I’ve only got one man
starting this morning, and he’s Irish.” The Irishman left the building
site and walked home slowly; as he walked past a shop window, he turned
and saw his face was black.</p><p><br></p><p>“By Jaasus, dave woke de wrong bloody man up!”</p><p><br></p><p>This is the situation. You are not yourself. You go on doing things –
getting married, giving birth to children, bringing up children – and
you are not yourself. You will do all the functions of your life and die
– and you never lived, you never allowed yourself to live! Somebody else
lived in your place, and somebody else will die. You came here and you
didn’t use the opportunity of life. You simply passed through without
being at all enriched by life, by love, by the thousand and one
experiences that life consists of.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, Gayatri, if the feeling is arising that “I am not myself”, don’t
be worried. This will create great worry in you; you will start feeling
shaky. Don’t be worried! This is a blessing! You are NOT yourself: this
is a truth that is dawning on you.</p><p>Now start searching for whip you are. You are NOT your faces. Now
begin the search for the original face, the face that you had before you
were born and the face that you will again have when you are dead.
Between the two, birth and death, you have many faces which are not
yours.</p><p><br></p><p>Now the time has come to get out of others’ expectations. Don’t go on
fulfilling others’ expectations; that is a very subtle slavery. The
mother wants you to do this, the father wants you to do that, the
society wants this... and everybody wants, everybody is making demands
on you. And nobody leaves you alone and nobody wants you to do the thing
that you would like to do. Now the time has come: do your own thing –
get out of all this bondage.</p><p>This is what sannyas is all about: a declaration of freedom, a
declaration that “I am going to be myself whatsoever the cost and
whatsoever the consequences.” And you will not be a loser, that I can
promise you; you will not be a loser, you will be infinitely enriched.
You are not here to fulfill others’ expectations, you are here to live
your authentic life.</p><p>And the others who are expecting are not aware of what they are doing
to you: they are simply expecting things which were expected from them.
Their parents had expected certain things; they followed, they remained
slaves. And they have given birth to you – now they are expecting the
same things from you.</p><p><br></p><p>You will give birth to children. Remember, don’t enforce any
expectation on them. Help them to be free, love them, but don’t give
your ideas to them. Love them, but don’t give your religions to them.
Love them, help them to become more aware so they can choose their
religion, their idea,</p><p><br></p><p>whatsoever they want to be. Help them to become strong, more
conscious. Don’t give them any conscience, any character. Give them more
consciousness, every opportunity to become more alert. And trust life,
don’t be so afraid. And don’t prepare everything for them; otherwise
they will never grow any backbone, they will remain spineless. Don’t
protect them too much. Yes, protect them when there is danger, but not
too much. Give them enough rope so they can learn to walk on their own
feet. Leave them sometimes alone, don’t be constantly after them. Give
them some space where they can feel themselves. Don’t overcrowd them,
don’t impinge on them.</p><p><br></p><p>Get out of the interference of others. Yes, it will be difficult
because others are not going to leave you so easily; nobody wants to
leave his slave so easily. And they will talk about love, and they will
say, “I love you, so you have to follow me.” Love never asks that; this
is not love.</p><p>Love says, “Be a light unto yourself.” If it is true love it always
gives you freedom. And it trusts that the inner life that you have, the
inner light that you have, will lead you, will guide you. And even if
you sometimes go astray it is good, because one learns only by trial and
error; there is no other way. You cannot be protected from committing
errors. If you are protected from committing errors you will never
learn; you will always remain stupid, retarded – and that is the
situation of millions of people in the world.</p><p><br></p><p>The average mental age of humanity is only twelve years. This is a
very sad situation, it is very unfortunate. A seventy-year-old person,
and the mental age of twelve? It can be just the other way too; the
seventy-year-old person can have the mental age of seven hundred years
too. That’s how it should be.</p><p><br></p><p>Somebody asked Emerson, “How old are you?” And he was sixty, but he
said, “Three hundred and sixty years old.”</p><p>The questioner could not believe his ears. He said, “Please, repeat
it again.”</p><p>And Emerson repeated it slowly. He said, “Three hundred and sixty,
that is my actual age.” And the man said, “Are you kidding? You don’t
look more than sixty.”</p><p>Emerson said, “Chronologically I am sixty, but I have lived so much
in these sixty years – six times more than people usually live – hence I
count my age to be three hundred and sixty years.”</p><p>Don’t die a retarded person. And don’t sacrifice yourself for
beautiful names: love, duty, service,</p><p>society. Your first duty is towards your being. Fulfill that first,
and then all else will be fulfilled.</p><p><br></p><p>My own observation is that a person who loves himself deeply becomes
so blissful that his whole life becomes a prayer, a service, compassion.
Only a blissful person can have compassion, and only a blissful person
can have love. The person who goes on following others remaining so
miserable deep down, so crippled – how can he love, how can he be
compassionate? Yes, he can go through empty motions of love, duty, but
that is not going to fulfill him or the person he is dutiful to. It is
not going to fulfill anybody.</p><p><br></p><p>Look at the situation! The whole of humanity pretends to love, and
still there is no love. You don’t feel the fragrance of love, you don’t
see the joy of love. And everybody is a lover! If so many millions</p><p><br></p><p>of people were loving the world would become a paradise. But it is
not; it is a hell! And the reason is that nobody is courageous enough to
be free from the expectations of others.</p><p><br></p><p>Be free, Gayatri! The time has come to be free. You need not hurt
anybody. By being free I don’t mean being angry with others or fighting
with others or reacting negatively. That again is not freedom. If you
react, others will go on controlling you in a negative way.</p><p>For example, your mother has been teaching you that cleanliness is
next to God, and now you want to be free – so uncleanliness becomes next
to God. Your mother was teaching you every day, to take a cold shower
first thing in the morning; and now you have forgotten completely what
it feels like to have a shower. For years you have not taken a bath!
This is not freedom, this is reaction: your mother is still controlling
you in a negative way. She is still dominant; you are fighting with
her.</p><p><br></p><p>Freedom simply means that you start living intelligently on your own,
neither according to your mother nor against her. If you are against her
you can never be free. Don’t be against anybody and don’t be for
anybody, simply live out of your own simple intelligence. Yes, many
times you will commit errors; that’s perfectly okay because that’s how
one learns. Many times you will go astray; that’s absolutely right. By
going astray you will learn how to come back to the right track. And
when you come back to the right track, what joy, what rejoicing, what
celebration!</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t react, be rebellious. Reaction is not rebellion. Rebellion is
not at all concerned with others, for or against. Rebellion is something
that arises in you that is not concerned with others. And reaction does
not arise in you; it is concerned with others; first you were obedient,
now you are disobedient.</p><p>Don’t be obedient, don’t be disobedient – be intelligent! And soon
you will be able to discover your own original face, and that is how one
should be.</p><p>The fifth question:</p><p><br></p><p>OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>THE WHOLE OF EXISTENCE,</p><p><br></p><p>THE BIRDS, BEASTS, FLOWERS AND AIR CALL FOR OUR STILLNESS, OUR
MEDITATION.</p><p>ALL EXCEPT ONE SMALL INSECT, THIS WINGED PARASITE</p><p>THIS BUZZING DISTURBER THIS MOSQUITO.</p><p>IS HE THE DEVIL?</p><p><br></p><p>Abhinandan,</p><p><br></p><p>MOSQUITOES are ancient meditators who have fallen, hence they are
against anybody succeeding in meditation; they are very jealous. So
whenever you meditate they are there to disturb, to distract.</p><p><br></p><p>And this is nothing new, this has always been so. In al the ancient
scriptures it is mentioned, in Jain scriptures particularly so, because
the Jain monk lives naked. Just think of a naked Jain monk; and India,
and mosquitoes! Mahavir had to give specific instructions on what
attitude to take about mosquitoes. He had told his disciples that when
mosquitoes attack, accept. This is the ultimate distraction: if you can
win this then there is no other difficulty, no greater difficulty. And
when he says, he knows! – to live naked in India is a difficult
thing.</p><p>Once I stayed in Sarnath where Buddha delivered his first sermon,
where Buddha turned the wheel of DHAMMA... the MOST important sermon,
which became the beginning of a new tradition. I was staying with a
Buddhist monk.</p><p><br></p><p>I have seen mosquitoes, but nothing to be compared with Sarnath
mosquitoes. Poona mosquitoes are just nothing! You should feel very
happy about it! You are fortunate that I am not in Sarnath. The
mosquitoes were really that big!</p><p>Even in the daytime we used to sit under the mosquito nets. In one
mosquito net, in one bed, would sit the Buddhist monk, in the other I
would sit, and we would talk.</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I am never going to come again” – because he was asking me
to come again and stay. I</p><p>said, “Never, never! This is my first and last time.”</p><p>He said, “That reminds me that down the ages Buddhist monks have been
laughing and joking about why Buddha never came again to Sarnath. He
came only once; he delivered the first sermon, and escaped!” He went
many times to other places. He must have gone at least thirty times to
Shravasti, he must have gone at least forty times to Rajgiri, and so on
and so forth. Each place that he visited, he visited again and again.
But Sarnath, only once; he never went back again to that place.</p><p><br></p><p>“And,” the monk said, “it is because of these mosquitoes. And you
also say that you will never come again.”</p><p>I said to him, “At least in one thing I will follow Buddha! I cannot
follow in other things – I have to be</p><p>a’light unto myself’ – but about this thing let him be the
light!”</p><p><br></p><p>I know it is difficult, very difficult, but you will have to learn.
Don’t be distracted. That does not mean that you allow the mosquitoes to
exploit you. Protect yourself in every possible way, but with no
anxiety, no irritation. Protect yourself, avoid the mosquitoes, throw
them away, shake them off, but with no irritation. They are doing THEIR
thing, and. that much has to be accepted. They are not particularly
against you. Somebody must be having his breakfast or lunch or dinner...
so be polite. You have every right to protect yourself, but no need to
be irritated. Irritation will disturb the meditation not the mosquito.
You can shake the mosquito off very meditatively, attentively, fully
alert, with no irritation. Try it!</p><p><br></p><p>The real problem never comes from the outside, the real problem
always comes from inner irritation. For example, dogs are barking
outside and you are meditating. Now, immediately you are angry –</p><p><br></p><p>these stupid dogs! But they are not in any way disturbing your
meditation, they are simply enjoying their life! They must have seen a
policeman or a postman or a sannyasin! Dogs are very much against
uniforms, very anti-uniform; the moment they see a uniform they start
barking. They don’t believe in uniforms, and they are entitled to have
their own belief – but they are not particularly trying to disturb
you.</p><p><br></p><p>Once I stayed in a resthouse where a politician was also staying. He
was a chief minister of a state. And just as you see mosquitoes here...
Somebody else has written that they have disappeared from all over the
city and they have come to the ashram. They are not so much in the town
as they are here in the ashram. In fact they cannot get such juicy food
anywhere else!</p><p>Exactly the same was the case with that resthouse. All the dogs of
the town somehow had gathered there. Such a great fight was going on. I
fell asleep, and the politician could not. So he came, he shook me awake
and he said, “I feel envious of you! How can you sleep when there is so
much disturbance? And I have gone thrice outside and thrown stones at
the dogs. They go away for a moment, I come in, and they are back. I
don’t think that I can sleep the whole night.”</p><p>I said, “If I can sleep, you can also sleep.” He said, “What is the
secret?”</p><p>I said, “The secret is simple: you lie down and listen to the dogs as
if they are singing a lullaby.” He said, “Lullaby? And dogs?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Try! You can’t lose anything in trying it. Why be against
them? Just the idea that ‘I cannot sleep because dogs are barking,’ is
the root cause of your disturbance, not the dogs and their barking –
your idea. You drop that idea, you accept the barking. You listen
attentively; you listen as if you are listening to music.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said again, “Music?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “You have to drop it! Otherwise get lost and don’t disturb
me! I have to sleep.”</p><p><br></p><p>Finding no other way, he said, “Okay, so I will try.” After fifteen
minutes he was snoring. I went in and shook him. He said, “What are you
doing?” He said, “This is too much! Somehow I managed to sleep, and now
you have awakened me again!”</p><p>I said, “I have come to ask – does it work?” He said, “It works. And
please, don’t come again. Let me try again. Somehow I had managed it; it
was very difficult to think of it as music, to think of it as a lullaby,
to think of dogs as friends, it was very difficult – but finding no
other way I said, ‘Okay, let us try’. And it worked!”</p><p><br></p><p>And in the morning he told me, “I will keep this secret. It can work
in many situations. It can work in all</p><p>situations.”</p><p>Mosquitoes are doing their thing. You have to protect yourself, you
have to do your own thing, but</p><p>don’t get irritated. Just irritation is the problem. And then if you
cannot get irritated, if you are not</p><p><br></p><p>distracted by all the nuisance that mosquitoes are creating around
you, you will even feel grateful to them: they have given you a secret
key.</p><p><br></p><p>If you are not distracted by the mosquitoes, then nothing can
distract you. Then you have come to a very stable state of
meditation.</p><p>The sixth question:</p><p><br></p><p>YOU OFTEN SPEAK OF BECOMING A BUDDHA. BUT SHANKARA OFTEN SAID THAT
BUDDHA ONLY BROUGHT HIS DISCIPLES TO COSMIC CONSCIOUSNESS, WHILE THERE
ARE STILL HIGHER STATES OF CONSCIOUSNESS, SUCH AS UNITY CONSCIOUSNESS
AND BRAHMA CONSCIOUSNESS.</p><p>PLEASE WILL YOU COMMENT ON THIS AND, IF YOU KNOW, TELL US ABOUT THE
PATHS WHICH LEAD TO THESE STATES.</p><p><br></p><p>Zoli Korlbeek,</p><p><br></p><p>BUDDHA has not talked about cosmic consciousness at all. He talks
about ultimate no-selfness beyond which there is nothing, beyond which
there cannot be anything. He talks about the total disappearance of the
ego.</p><p><br></p><p>All other states belong to the ego: “I have attained this, I have
attained that, I have attained that – cosmic consciousness and unity
consciousness and Brahma consciousness.…” Who is attaining these things?
There must be some identity, some ‘I’, howsoever subtle.</p><p>Shankara remains confined to the self. He goes on refining it,
polishing it, but he never goes beyond the self.</p><p>Buddha goes to no-self. Now no-self cannot have many states. No-self
is simply no-self – utter nothingness. How can nothingness have states?
It is impossible, because two nothingnesses cannot be different. Nobody
has gone beyond Buddha. What Shankara is talking about is far lower.</p><p><br></p><p>And there are ways to attain to. cosmic consciousness and unity
consciousness and Brahma consciousness, but they are nothing but new
illusions. Even when you say and think, “I have become one with God”,
you are there. Who is feeling that “I have become one with God”? Even to
declare “AHAM BRAHMASMI, I am the ultimate!”, needs something of the ‘I’
there to declare it; maybe the last tail end – the elephant is gone but
the tail is still there. And the tail is enough to bring the whole
elephant back at any time.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha is the ultimate beyond which nobody has ever gone. Shankara is
still groping far behind. Shankara is a great philosopher; Buddha is not
a philosopher at all. Shankara is a great logician; Buddha is not a
logician at all, Buddha is a pure, existential mystic. Hence Buddha
never talks about all this jargon: cosmic consciousness, unity
consciousness, Brahma consciousness – you can create as many as you
want.</p><p><br></p><p>If you are really interested in such nonsense then there is a sect in
India, Radha Swami Sampraday. They talk about fourteen states, and they
have a map, and only THEIR Master has attained to the fourteenth. Buddha
et cetera are somewhere on the third, fourth, fifth; Krishna, Christ are
somewhere on the second; Shankara et cetera are just somewhere on the
seventh. The fourteenth they call the Land of Truth, SATCHKAND; that
space of truth has been attained only by THEIR Master, Radha Swami. Now
these games can be played.</p><p><br></p><p>Once a Radha Swami follower came to me and he said, “Do you know
anything about the</p><p>fourteenth?”</p><p>I said, “Who cares about the fourteenth? no you know about the
fifteenth?”</p><p>He said, “Fifteenth? Never heard of it!” “I have attained to the
fifteenth! And I know your guru – he is</p><p>just lagging behind.”</p><p><br></p><p>And he was asking me the secret of the fifteenth! All foolish talk!
But this is how the ego works.</p><p><br></p><p>Now you seem to be a Shankara-freak; in India there are many.
Shankara has impressed many because he is really clever at logical
argumentation; but logical argumentation is just meaningless as far as
existential experience is concerned.</p><p>Shankara used to say that the world is illusion, and he used to prove
it. And it can be proved logically because logically it is very
difficult to prove that it is real. Who knows? – you may be simply
dreaming that you are listening to me, that I am here talking to you.
Sometimes in a dream you have listened to me, and in the dream it looks
so real. So who knows? – maybe now you are dreaming and it is looking so
real. How can it be proved that I am really here and you are really
there? In fact there is no way to prove it, it may be a dream.</p><p><br></p><p>Chuang Tzu says that he dreamed in the night that he had become a
butterfly, and since then he has been very confused – confused because
now in the morning, he thinks it may be just that the butterfly had
fallen asleep and was dreaming that she was Chuang Tzu. Now who is
right: Chuang Tzu dreaming that he has become a butterfly, or Butterfly
dreaming that she has become a Chuang Tzu? Now what is true? If Chuang
Tzu can become a butterfly in the dream, why can’t a butterfly sitting
on the foliage in the shade in the afternoon dream and think that she
has become a Chuang Tzu? What is wrong about it? It can happen in both
ways! It is difficult to prove that the world is real. Hence Shankara
was proving that the world is illusory. All is illusory, only God is
true.</p><p><br></p><p>But one strange man – nobody knows who he was, must have been of
great insight – disturbed him very much. One day Shankara was coming
from the Ganges early in the morning, as was his habit. He took his
usual bath of purification in the Ganges, in Varanasi. It was still
dark, he was coming up the stairs, and one untouchable, one SUDRA
touched him. Now he was very angry and he said, “You have destroyed my
bath. I will have to go again and take a bath. And you should know how
to behave. Is this the way? Can’t you see a BRAHMIN?”</p><p>And the SUDRA, the untouchable started laughing. He said, “But last
night I heard you arguing with</p><p>great intelligence, with great acumen, that the world is illusory. So
I thought that if the whole</p><p><br></p><p>world is illusory then these untouchables must be illusory. How can
an illusory untouchable touch you in the first place? Secondly, how can
an illusory person destroy your purity? Who has touched whom? If the
body is illusory, then your body is also illusory. Two illusions
touching each other cannot be different. Or do you think your soul is
pure and my soul is impure? If the soul also can be impure then there is
no way of making it pure. What do you think – have I touched your body
or your soul? Who has become impure? And just last night I heard your
argumentation. It was great! And I become so convinced, that’s why I
have come.”</p><p>Shankara was at a loss, touched the feet of the man and said, “Excuse
me. It has been only logic it</p><p>seems. I have not yet experienced.”</p><p><br></p><p>He was a great philosopher, the greatest that India has produced. But
remember one thing: he is nowhere close to Buddha, and cannot be. In
fact whatsoever he was saying was all borrowed from Buddha, hence he has
been known as a hidden Buddhist. Whatsoever he has been saying, he has
only changed the words and terminology, but he is talking about the same
things. And that is one of the arguments of those who are against
Shankara: that he is just a PRACHCHHANNA BUDDHA, a hidden Buddhist –
using Hindu terminology instead of Buddhist terminology, that’s all.</p><p><br></p><p>Zoli, don’t be too much bothered with Shankara – unless you are
interested in philosophy, then it is okay. Then you can read Shankara
and you can read Nagarjuna and you can read Nimbarka, and you can read
so many more in the West.</p><p><br></p><p>But if you are really interested in transformation then Buddha will
be of great help, Lao Tzu will be of great help, Jesus will be of great
help. If you are really interested in transformation, then listen to
those who have reached the ultimate peak. Shankara was also trying, and
he has said a few beautiful things, but nothing to be compared to
Buddha.</p><p><br></p><p>And this is all nonsense, this cosmic consciousness, unity
consciousness, Brahma consciousness. These are clever strategies to
befool the masses.</p><p>Buddha talks only of ANATTA, no-self, ultimate emptiness, absolute
death of the ego. And when you have disappeared there is nothing more to
happen. To whom is it going to happen? When you are no more, all has
happened. All happening disappears. That state where nothing happens any
more is called NIRVANA.</p><p>NIRVANA IS a beautiful word. It means utter cessation; literally it
means blowing out the candle. Just as you blow out a candle and suddenly
the light disappears and is nowhere found, in deep meditation the small
flame of the ego dissappears. You blow it out, and there is utter
nothingness left: no experiencer, no experienced. That is NIRVANA. There
is no more and nothing beyond it.</p><p>The last question:</p><p><br></p><p>COME ON, OSHO, BE A SPORT AND TELL US THAT JUICY JOKE!</p><p><br></p><p>Okay, Maneesha!</p><p><br></p><p>ONE day, while studying the alphabet, the teacher looked at her
second grade class and said, “Who can tell me a word that starts with
the letter A?”</p><p><br></p><p>All the children raised their hands, but teacher wouldn’t call on
Johnny Badmouth because she knew he’d say ‘asshole’ or some other bad
word. Instead she called on Billy.</p><p>“Apple.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Very good,” replied teacher, “and who can tell me a word that starts
with the letter B?”</p><p>Many children raised their hands, but she refused to call on Johnny
Badmouth because she knew</p><p>he’d say ‘bastard’ or some other dirty word. She called on Mary.
“Boat.”</p><p>“Very good.”</p><p>And so on through the entire alphabet, each time ignoring Johnny
Badmouth. “And who can tell me a word that starts with the letter R?”
The children raised their hands. The teacher racked her brains, but
couldn’t think of a single dirty word that started with the letter R,
and decided to call on Johnny.</p><p><br></p><p>“Rats,” said Johnny, and raised his hands to demonstrate. “BIG
FUCKING RATS!”</p><p><br></p><p>CH APT E R 3</p><p><br></p><p>Li ve i n t h e i s !</p><p><br></p><p>2 8 A p r i l 1 9 7 9 a m i n B u d dh a H a l l</p><p><br></p><p>The first question:</p><p><br></p><p>OSHO, WHEN SUCH INCREDIBLE HAPPINESS DESCENDS, WHY DO I FEEL SO
UNWORTHY?</p><p>Abhiyana,</p><p><br></p><p>IT’S natural, because that which descends has nothing to do with your
effort. It is a grace, it is a gift from God. And the gift is so big, so
huge, so enormous... it is natural to be overwhelmed. It is like a
flood, as if the ocean has descended into the dewdrop.</p><p>How can one feel worthy? You have not earned it. It has nothing to do
with your effort, your doing, your practising. It has simply come to you
for no reason at all. Hence one feels dumb,. lost, in such an awe that
breathing stops, that the heart beats no more. The whole world
stops.</p><p><br></p><p>Whenever it happens to anybody, the same is the experience – the
feeling of great unworthiness. But it is beautiful! It will give you a
depth in humbleness; slowly, slowly the ego will be eroded. And sooner
or later you will find that with your effort, with your worth, only
small things are possible. All great things HAPPEN, they cannot be done
– and they happen for no reason at all, remember it.</p><p>The beauty of the sunset, the song of a bird, a small lonely flower,
the moon... there is no reason for it at all. Nobody can answer why it
is there: why the rose is so beautiful, and why this existence</p><p><br></p><p>exists at all, and why the universe moves with such tremendous grace,
harmony. There is no reason at all!</p><p><br></p><p>Hence I say it is a mystery, and it remains a mystery even for those
who have gone deeply into it, who have become dissolved into it. It is
never demystified.</p><p>But you are fortunate, Abhiyana, that those moments have started
happening. Don’t be shy to receive them, don’t be embarrassed. It is
natural in the beginning to feel unworthy. Slowly, slowly that grace
will transform you. Those moments will come more and more; they will
become natural. They will become a shadow to you: where you will be,
they will be there. Waking, asleep, you will find that grace surrounding
you. That grace will be without and within. That grace will become a
luminous point within your heart, and the flame will go on burning.</p><p><br></p><p>But remember, don’t become too much worried about your unworthiness.
If you become too much worried about your unworthiness those moments
will start disappearing, because your focus has changed. Rather than
feeling unworthy and becoming focused on it, feel the compassion of God
and become focused on it. Remember, these are two different gestalts;
both are possible.</p><p><br></p><p>The unintelligent will become too much concerned about his
unworthiness and will start denying those moments: “How can those
moments happen when I am so unworthy? It must be my imagination, it must
be a trick of the mind. I must be going crazy!” And you will become
convinced by your own logic that those moments are not true. You have to
prove them untrue because you are so focused on your unworthiness. If
they are true, then you are not unworthy.</p><p>And your society has been teaching you that you are unworthy. You
have been told that you are of no use, you are utterly worthless. You
are nothing but dust – dust unto dust. You are more worthless than dirt:
that’s what has been told to you in so many ways; it has become a
deeprooted idea in you. If you pay too much attention to it, the only
possibility is that you will deny those moments.</p><p>And I know many people who have denied when the mysterious has
knocked on their doors, just because they cannot leave the idea of their
unworthiness. Then the only possibility is to deny those moments, call
them imaginary, hallucinations, dreams, deceptions; something must have
gone wrong in your head, you are going berserk; forget all about them
because they remind you of your unworthiness. Don’t become focused on
it, be focused on the compassion of God.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why all the religions emphasize: God is compassionate – RAHIM,
RAHMAN! – God is compassion. This is just to give you an alternative
gestalt so you become focused on His compassion, not on your
unworthiness. You may be unworthy – that is irrelevant – but God is
compassionate. You may be a sinner – that is irrelevant – God is
compassionate. He gives for no reason at all; He is simply a giver, He
knows only giving. And He does not give conditionally, He gives
unconditionally.</p><p>Jesus tells a parable again and again.</p><p><br></p><p>A rich man called forth a few laborers to work in his garden in the
morning. The fruits were becoming ripe and they had to be collected
soon. But by the afternoon it was felt that the laborers were not
enough; more were needed, so more laborers were called. By the evening
it was felt that even those</p><p><br></p><p>laborers were not enough; a few more were needed, and they were
called. And when the third group of laborers went the sun was almost
setting.</p><p><br></p><p>Then it was night, all the laborers were called, and the rich man
gave exactly the same amount to everybody. Those who had come in the
morning and those who had come in the afternoon and those who had just
come and had not worked at all were also given the same amount of money.
Naturally, the people who had been working the whole day in the hot sun
complained; they were angry. They said, “This is unjust! These people
have just come! They have not done anything at all, and they receive the
same amount of money? And a few people have come in the middle of the
day, they have done only half the work, and they also receive the same
amount of money as we have received? This is unfair!”</p><p>The wealthy man laughed and he said, “Answer me one question: is what
I have given to you not</p><p>enough for the labor that you have done?”</p><p><br></p><p>They said, “It is more than enough, but what about the others?”</p><p><br></p><p>And the rich man said, “You need not worry about others. I give them
not because they have worked, I give them because I have too much to
give. I am burdened! Can’t I give my money to anybody, to whomsoever I
want to give? Can’t I throw my money to the winds? You have received
your worth. You have received because you worked, they are receiving
because I have so much to give.”</p><p><br></p><p>This is a very strange parable; except for Jesus, nobody has told
such a thing. Jesus is saying that those who are working hard, those who
are cultivating culture, virtue, character, those who are practising
austerities, the doers, they will receive: they will receive according
to what they have done. But lovers will also receive, who have not
cultivated any virtue, who have not cultivated any austerity, who have
simply lived and rejoiced, who have simply prayed, who are not great
saints, who may even be known as sinners in the world. They will also
receive, and the SAME amount, because God is compassion.</p><p>This is something of immense value that Jesus has said. He has opened
the doors of grace for people.</p><p>That’s what is happening to you, Abhiyana – not because you have done
anything special to attain it, but because God has so much He goes on
showering on anybody who is receptive.</p><p>And my work here is to help you to become receptive. My function here
is not to teach you how to attain to God, but to teach you how to
receive god when He comes. And He comes... and He comes every day, and
He comes every moment. You are just not in a receptive mood, hence you
go on missing. It is not according to your saintliness that you will
receive Him; it is according to your emptiness, receptivity,
humbleness.</p><p><br></p><p>You cannot earn God. It is always a gift, and whenever it comes you
will feel unworthy. And it is good to feel unworthy; don’t become
focused on it, don’t become obsessed by it. Feeling unworthy, emphasize
God’s compassion. Feeling unworthy, see the beauty: that the gift is
unconditional, that you cannot claim it yet it has been given to
you.</p><p><br></p><p>You have heard Jesus’ famous statement: Knock, and the doors shall be
opened unto you. Ask, and it shall be given. Seek, and ye shall
find.</p><p><br></p><p>Once Rabiya, a woman Sufi mystic, was passing, and she saw Hassan,
another Sufi, praying in the mosque with great fervor, tears rolling
down his cheeks, hands raised to the sky. He was crying and weeping and
saying to God, “Come, open the door! Let me in!”</p><p>This was very usual with Hassan, almost an everyday ritual, five
times a day. And he was doing it very sincerely. It was not just a
ritual, not a mere ritual; his heart was in it. He was a man of great
qualities. And Rabiya had heard him many times, and whenever she heard
him she smiled, laughed, and went on her way.</p><p>But that day she went close to Hassan and shook him. Hassan looked at
her, and Rabiya said, “How long are you going to do it? I tell you, the
doors are open! You need not ask Him again and again, ‘When will you
open the doors?’ Don’t be foolish! Enough is enough! I have heard enough
of all this nonsense! The doors are open – just open your eyes and
see!”</p><p><br></p><p>Rabiya’s statement goes far deeper than Jesus’ statement. Jesus says,
“Knock, and the doors shall be opened.” Rabiya says, “Open your eyes –
the doors are already open!”</p><p><br></p><p>And I am saying to you: God is already coming, God HAS come. He is
standing at your doors. Open your doors, open your eyes, just open your
heart!</p><p><br></p><p>And certainly, when God’s energy showers on you, how can you feel you
are worthy? Impossible! The gift is so big, as if somebody has given a
Kohinoor diamond to a beggar. He cannot believe it; he will think it
must be an artificial thing, or maybe somebody is kidding: “I am a
beggar! Who can give me the Kohinoor diamond? Impossible! Maybe I am
dreaming, maybe I have gone mad. This is an ordinary stone – I am
projecting!”</p><p>That’s what happens to everybody when God comes in. But don’t become
focused on it, become focused on God’s overflowing energy.</p><p><br></p><p>God IS overflowing energy, God is overflowing joy! God is
SATCHITANANDA – overflowing truth, overflowing consciousness,
overflowing bliss. Just whenever you are ready, receptive, it is going
to happen. It could have happened at any time; no time was the wrong
time, no time was an unripe time. It could not happen for just one
single reason: because you were not open. And if you become obsessed
with your unworthiness you will become closed again.</p><p>It is natural, Abhiyana – but look at the compassion, look at the
friendliness of existence. Look at its acceptance of you, whoever you
are, wherever you are. It makes no difference between the saints and the
sinners. God is available to everybody.</p><p><br></p><p>The second question:</p><p><br></p><p>OSHO, WHY DO I GO ON FORGETTING MYSELF?</p><p><br></p><p>Gyan Deva,</p><p><br></p><p>IT IS an ancient habit; for many, many lives you have practised it.
You have put so much energy into it, into forgetting yourself. You
remember money, you remember others, you remember the world. To remember
all these things – all these things which Taoists call ‘the ten thousand
and one things’<span class=s5></span>If</p><p>you want to remember these ten thousand and one things, you will have
to forget yourself, because your eyes will be focused on things, on
people, on the world, and of course you will fall in the shadow.</p><p><br></p><p>It is a long, long habit – just a habit. You are there; you can turn
in. But turning in seems to be difficult because your neck has become
paralyzed. For how many lives have you remained in this forgetfulness?
Now suddenly, you want to remember.</p><p>At the most, for one or two seconds you can remember; again you will
forget. But those one or two seconds open the doors of hope. Don’t be
worried: if you can remember only for a single moment, that’s enough,
the key is with you. You are never given more than a single moment at a
single time; you are never given two moments together. If you can
remember for a single moment, that’s enough, the key is there; now you
can work it out. After this moment is gone another moment will be given
to you, and you know how to be alert, aware, in a single moment – be
alert and aware in that.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember, you will forget many times, but don’t feel repentant.
Otherwise one starts feeling guilty and creating complexities which
don’t help, which in reality hinder. If you forget, so what! For
millions of lives you have been forgetting – accept it. And the moment
you remember that you have forgotten, it is good that you have
remembered again. Remember, you will forget again. When you forget,
forget, when you remember, remember, but don’t make much of a problem
out of it. Slowly, remembering more and more, by and by, gradually, the
forgetfulness, the habit, will be broken.</p><p>Mrs. McMahon went berserk one afternoon. She broke every dish and cup
and reduced her usually</p><p>spotless kitchen to shambles. The police arrived and took her to the
city’s mental institution.</p><p><br></p><p>The head psychiatrist sent for her husband.</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you know any reason,” asked the shrink, “why your wife should
suddenly lose her mind?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am just as surprised as you are,” answered Mr. McMahon. “I can’t
imagine what got into her. She has always been such a quiet,
hard-working woman. Why, she has not been out of the kitchen in twenty
years!”</p><p><br></p><p>How many lives have you not been out of the kitchen? How many lives
have you remained in a state of forgetfulness, in a state of
unconsciousness? Now suddenly you try to be aware – the weight of the
past is too much, the chains of the past are too heavy. But they WILL be
broken; all that is needed is perseverance and patience.</p><p><br></p><p>And you have to be very, very intelligent about it. Otherwise, my
observation is, people try to remember and when they cannot they start
feeling very guilty. That too is part of your habit: if you cannot do
something you immediately start feeling guilty. And if you feel guilty
it will be more difficult to remember. If you feel frustrated; sooner or
later you will stop the very effort of remembering.</p><p><br></p><p>Be intelligent. Seeing that for many lives you have not remembered
yourself, it is natural that you forget. Even if you can remember for a
few moments, feel grateful, feel thankful – you are.doing the
impossible!</p><p><br></p><p>A little intelligence is needed. Otherwise rather than the so-called
religious people becoming religious, they become simply guilt-ridden,
they become repentant, they start feeling about themselves as if they
are condemned, as if they are not the chosen ones; as if God has thrown
them into the dark night and has forgotten them; as if it may have
happened to a Buddha or a Kabir or a Krishna or a Zarathustra, but it is
not going to happen to them. “They were special people; that’s why it
happened to them. They were already born enlightened; that’s why it
happened to them: it can’t happen to me, I am an ordinary person.”</p><p>Just to avoid remembering, people have created all kinds of theories.
Hindus say Krishna is an incarnation of God. Christians say Jesus is the
only-begotten son of God – mind you, the only- begotten. And all others
are bastards? The Jains say Mahavir is a TEERTHANKARA, very special, not
an ordinary soul, not even an ordinary body. Mahavir does not perspire,
he is not an ordinary human being. He does not defecate or urinate, no;
he is not an ordinary being, he is very special, his body is special.
Jesus is born out of a virgin mother – he is not an ordinary mortal,
even his birth is special, and so on, so forth.</p><p><br></p><p>Every religion has created these theories, and on the surface it
looks as if you are paying great respects to Mahavir, Krishna, Buddha.
You are not! In fact you are simply trying to avoid remembering
yourself. You are saying, “They are special and we are not, so they can
remember, they can realize, they can become enlightened. We cannot!”
This is a very political strategy, but very unintelligent. This is how
you are preventing yourself from becoming enlightened.</p><p>Nobody is special, or everybody is special. Nobody is an incarnation
of God, or everybody is an incarnation of God. Choose either, but don’t
make a few people special. That is the trick, and that is a very stupid
trick. Because of it you have not remembered yet who you are. Be a
little more intelligent. You have not remembered up to now because you
have not decided to remember, that’s all. Now decide to remember.</p><p>Gyan Deva, this decision to remember is going to create many, many
problems for you. Forgetfulness is easy, habitual, has become second
nature. Now you are going against your habits; the habits will create
every kind of hindrance, obstacle. Only for moments will you be able to
pull yourself out of your habits, and they will drag you back again into
the old mire. But don’t be worried: if it is possible to remember even
for a single moment, it is possible to remember; that one moment is
enough proof. And that one moment will give you such joy and such
freedom that you cannot relapse back into forgetfulness forever.</p><p><br></p><p>But don’t make much fuss about it. If you forget, it is natural,
accept it. If you remember, that is something great to rejoice in.
Rather than repenting for forgetfulness, rejoice in being able to
remember. Just a little intelligence... The Irish paratroop trainees
were flying out for their first parachute jump after several weeks’
training.</p><p><br></p><p>“Remember, lads,” said the instructor. “Yell ‘Geronimo’, jump out,
count to eight, and then pull your</p><p>ripcord.”</p><p><br></p><p>The door opened at 1O,OOO feet, all the lads jumped out one by one,
and Paddy went last. The instructor shut the door, and the plane flew
down and landed. The instructor got out and saw Paddy, frantically
clutching the plane’s wing.</p><p><br></p><p>“What the hell do you think you’re doing?” yelled the instructor.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sorry, sir,” said Paddy, “but I forgot the name of that bleeding
Indian!”</p><p><br></p><p>That Geronimo! It is not the name of any’bloody Indian’; it is just
an exclamation...’alleluia!’ And it is irrelevant too. The whole point
is that after counting to eight you pull your ripcord. And counting to
eight is also not to be followed literally – you can count to ten, you
can count to six; that will do.</p><p>Don’t become too unintelligent in what you are doing, particularly
when you are moving towards inward consciousness. Remember, everything
is just a formal support; anything can be of help.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, you are sitting here. You can just remember, and you can
use these words: ‘I am here’... and feel it’I am here’; not just the
words, but the existential feel...’I am here’... and a sudden
remembering, a witnessing. Repeat it whenever you want to remember: ‘I
am here’. And then slowly slowly, when you are capable of remembering ‘I
am here’ and it has become a feel in you – not just words in.the head,
but in the guts you can feel ‘I am here’ – then drop the word ‘here’.
Then simply say, ‘I am’, and that will do – and that will do far better.
Just ‘I am’, and a great remembrance, and a great light, and a great
rooted feeling in existence. But don’t become attached to the words.
When you have become capable of remembering ‘I am’, drop the ‘I’. Then
simply use the word ‘am’. Whenever you want to remember, just say’am’ –
but that too has to be dropped finally. These are not mantras to be
repeated, these are just simple devices. Then drop ‘am’ too, then simply
remember without using any word. You can give just a small shrug, a
nudge, and remember. Then even the nudge should be dropped.</p><p>ALL devices have to be dropped, because the human tendency is to
become more attached to the device than to the purpose.</p><p>You say, Gyan Deva, “WHY DO I GO ON FORGETTING MYSELF?”</p><p><br></p><p>Because you have been living in forgetfulness for many lives. This
may be your first chance to remember. There are people who have tried to
remember in their past lives; when they come it is easier for them,
because nothing is ever lost. If you have meditated in the past lives,
all that you have done in those meditations will remain part of your
being,.and whenever you meditate again that energy will become
available.</p><p><br></p><p>But a few people are meditating for the first time; then it is a
little more difficult, but not impossible. Take the challenge! Never
feel repentant. Just rejoice in the positive that happens to you and
never be worried about the negative. Accept the negative as it is and
rejoice in the positive, and the positive will go on growing and the
negative will be reduced of its own accord.</p><p><br></p><p>The third question:</p><p><br></p><p>OSHO, I LIVE IN THE WORLD OF THE CONDITIONAL – COULD, SHOULD, WOULD,
MAY, MIGHT AND IS, ARE MY DREAM OPERATIVES, WHICH ONLY MY MIND
ACCOMPLISHES, USUALLY IN THE PAST TENSE. WHY AM I SO SECURE IN THIS
ILLUSION?</p><p><br></p><p>Bhagawati,</p><p><br></p><p>ONE can be secure only in an illusion, because security is the
greatest illusion there is. Life is insecure. Love is insecure. To be is
to be in insecurity. To be is to be in constant danger. Only the dead
are secure because they cannot die any more; nothing can ever happen to
them now.</p><p>The more alive you are the more insecure you are. Hence many people
have decided not to be alive, because a kind of deadness gives security,
protection, armor. Many people have decided not to look into reality,
because reality IS insecure. I cannot do anything, you cannot do
anything about it – it is how it is. Reality is insecure; one never
knows what is going to happen in the next moment. I may be here, I may
not be here; you may be here, you may not be here. The next breath may
come in, may not come. The person who loves you may simply forget all
about you tomorrow. That’s how life is.</p><p><br></p><p>So we have created illusions to hide ourselves behind the illusions,
so we need not see the insecurity of life. Marriage is an illusion, love
is a reality. Love is insecure! Nobody knows whether it is going to be
there tomorrow or not. It is like a breeze: when it comes it comes, when
it is gone it is gone. You cannot manipulate it, you cannot control it,
you cannot predict it.</p><p><br></p><p>But the mind is very much afraid: if tomorrow your woman leaves you,
what are you going to do? How will you ever be able to live without her?
You have become so dependent on her, you cannot conceive of yourself
without her. So you make some arrangements: close the doors, close the
windows, lock everything, so she cannot escape. That’s what marriage is:
making legal locks so you cannot easily escape. You can go to the
police, you can go to the court, you can harass the woman to come
back.</p><p><br></p><p>But when you close all the doors and all the windows, the woman is no
longer the same as she was when she was under the sky, under the stars;
she is no longer the same. The bird on the wing is a totally different
phenomenon from the bird in the cage. The bird in the cage is no more
the same bird, because it no longer has the same sky, the same freedom.
It is imprisoned, its soul is killed. It only appears alive – its wings
are cut. It only appears that it is; now it will only vegetate.</p><p>Without freedom there is no life. But one thing is good about the
cage: it has security. Now the bird need not be worried about food;
tomorrow morning he is going to be fed as usual. He need not worry about
enemies, predators; nobody can attack him. The bird may think he is not
caged but protected. He may think these iron bars are not enemies but
friends; he may start loving them. Even if one day you want to make him
free, he may not like the very idea; he may resist. He may not go even
if you open the door. He will say, “I am not going. How can I leave my
security?” He has forgotten all the joy of freedom; now he only
remembers the comfort and the convenience of security.</p><p><br></p><p>Marriage is a cage, love is the open sky. We have destroyed love and
created the illusion of marriage. It is ugly. Two persons together out
of love is one thing, and two persons together because of the law is
totally different. Their souls are no more together, only their bodies
are tethered together.</p><p><br></p><p>Because they cannot escape, because the escape seems to be costly –
and the children are there, and all the comforts of family life and the
home – they decide to remain slaves. They decide NOT to live but just to
exist. And then, of course, people have many kinds of illusions of the
past, of the future.</p><p>Bhagawati, you are not alone in it; every human being is in the same
boat. Because we cannot live in the present...</p><p><br></p><p>It is dangerous to live in the present because to live in the present
means to be authentic. We live in the past, we live in the future. Past
and future are very easy, comfortable, no danger. You can manipulate
your past, you can control it. You can order your past, your past is
very obedient. It is non-existential, it exists only in your memory; you
can arrange it again and again.</p><p>Hence one of the greatest psychological insights is that up to now no
autobiography has been written. Millions have been written, but they are
all untrue. To write an autobiography seems to be almost impossible,
because you always go on arranging your memories. When you look back, it
is not the real past that you are looking at. It is no longer there,
just your memory of it.</p><p><br></p><p>And in the memory also you choose. First you choose while you are
experiencing something; a thousand and one things are happening every
day, but you choose only a few, scientists say only two percent.
Ninety-eight percent is not chosen, only two percent. All that feels
good to you, ego- enhancing, gratifying, you choose. All that seems like
suffering, pain, all that hurts, you don’t choose.</p><p><br></p><p>Your memory is a choice first, and then each time you remember it
your experiences are growing, and your experiences go on being reflected
in your memories. You go on giving them new colors, you go on painting
them again and again, so many coats that by the time you write your
autobiography... and people write autobiographies only when they know
that they are dead. When they know that now nothing more is going to
happen, then they write autobiographies.</p><p>When a person is alive, how can he write his autobiography? When he
thinks that everything is finished: “I have lived, the full point has
come; now there is nothing else to happen,” then he writes. Now he looks
back, paints all the memories as he wants them to be. All
autobiographies are fiction.</p><p><br></p><p>My suggestion to the librarians is: all autobiographies should be
counted as fiction and should be categorized as fiction. They are
fiction and nothing else. You magnify things which you would like, and
unconsciously you add many things which have never happened. And I am
not saying that you are cheating knowingly, no; you may believe. Just
start telling a lie, and after ten years you will be suspicious about
whether it was a lie or a truth.</p><p>A journalist died; he knocked on the doors of heaven. Saint Peter
opened the door and said, “Sorry, are you a journalist?” – because it is
very difficult to miss a journalist: he looks like one from his very
face, from his eyes.</p><p>And the man said, “Yes, but how did you recognize it?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “It is very difficult to miss a journalist. But I am sorry,
we don’t have any place for journalists any more in heaven, the quota is
full. We have only one dozen journalists; even those are just useless
because nothing ever happens in heaven, nothing worth reporting, nothing
like news.”</p><p><br></p><p>You know the definition of news that George Bernard Shaw has given?
“When a man bites a dog it is</p><p>news, not when a dog bites a man.” That is not news, that is
nothing!</p><p><br></p><p>“In heaven news does not happen; no newspaper is published. Even
those twelve journalists are just useless, so what do we need you for?
You go to hell! – and there is news and news and news. Nothing else ever
happens there, everything is news. And there are many, many papers, and
great is their circulation. You go there, you will have a good job.”</p><p><br></p><p>But the journalist said, “No, I cannot go. Can’t you manage in some
way? If you give me twenty-four hours’ time I can convince some other
journalist to go to hell, and in his vacant place you can allow me
in.”</p><p>Peter said, “That’s okay – twenty-four hours are given. You go
in.”</p><p><br></p><p>The journalist entered with all his journalistic acumen, skill. He
started a rumor; to whomsoever he came across he said, “Have you heard?
A big newspaper is going to be started in hell and all the posts are
vacant – the chief editor and the assistant chief editor, and other
assistants,” and this and that, whomsoever he met he told that. After
twenty-four hours, when he got back, Saint Peter would not open the
door. He said, “You cannot go out, you have to stay in”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “But what is the matter?”</p><p>Saint Peter said, “All the twelve have left. Now at least just for
the name’s sake we should have one</p><p>journalist. You be in!”</p><p><br></p><p>The journalist said, “I can’t stay now any more. Let me go! There
must be something in the news. How can twelve persons believe if there
is nothing in it? It can’t be just a rumor! There must be some truth in
it – maybe a fragment, but there must be some truth in it. I cannot
remain any longer. Open the door, let me go!”</p><p>If you start a lie, sooner or later you will believe in it. In fact
before others believe in it you will believe in it, and after ten years
it will be difficult to tell whether it was a lie. After ten years it
will be difficult to tell whether you had dreamed about it or you had
really lived the thing. Your dreams and your life will become mixed into
each other.</p><p>It is very difficult to write an autobiography. It has not yet been
done, and I don’t think it can ever be done. Those who can write, they
don’t write. A Buddha can write, but he says he has no autobiography to
write. He says, “I was never born.” He says, “I have never uttered a
single word.” He says, “I never became enlightened because I was never
unenlightened.” He says, “I never died because nothing ever dies. So
what autobiography? There is no self, so what AUTObiography? There is no
ego, there is no center, so what about the circumference? No
circumference is possible.”</p><p><br></p><p>A Buddha can write but he will not write, and others who write are
bound to write fictions.</p><p><br></p><p>You go on living in the past; it is very comfortable. You are the
master – about your past you are the master; you can do anything you
want to do with the past. And about the future also you are the master:
you can become the President of America, of India– in the future. You
can do anything that you want, and everybody does something.</p><p><br></p><p>Just sitting silently, you start imagining that passing by the side
of the road you have found a bag full of money. And not only that, you
start planning how to use that money; you start purchasing things. You
are the master.</p><p>The past and the future give you the idea that you are a king. The
present takes all illusions away, the present simply reveals your naked
truth. And the present reveals the insecurity that life is, because life
implies death. And everything that is implies that it cannot be forever,
everything that is is going to be non-existential sooner or later. The
flower that has bloomed in the morning is beautiful; by the evening it
will be gone, the petals will wither away and tomorrow you will not find
even a trace of it. That’s how real life is: changing, moving, dynamic,
nothing static, nothing permanent, always in a flux.</p><p>Bhagawati, that’s why not only you but everybody starts living in the
past and the future: to avoid the</p><p>present and its danger.</p><p>Friedrich Nietzsche is right: he says, “Live dangerously.” In fact
there is no other way to live; one can only live dangerously. The other
way is of avoiding life, not of living.</p><p>And that’s what sannyas is all about. It is to accept the insecurity
of life, it is to accept death, it is to accept that everything can
disappear at any moment. Your love, your friendship, you, everything is
only for the moment. The next moment the petals will wither away, all
will be gone.</p><p>Knowing this and yet rejoicing, knowing this and yet dancing, knowing
this and yet having a song on your lips, knowing this and yet having joy
in your eyes – that’s what sannyas is all about. In fact, this
insecurity is beautiful. This insecurity has a blessing in it, because
if everything were secure there would be no life at all. If everything
were secure there would be rocks and rocks – no flowers, no birds, no
people. If everything were secure there might be notes, mathematics,
science, but no poetry, no music, no dance. The world would be a dead
world, phony, plastic.</p><p><br></p><p>The real world has to be in a constant danger. That danger adds to
its beauty, that danger gives a depth, that danger makes it
challenging.</p><p>Bhagawati, come out of your security and your illusions. You</p><p><br></p><p>say, “I LIVE IN THE WORLD OF THE CONDITIONAL.”</p><p><br></p><p>The world of the conditional is the world of the mind. The true world
is unconditional. You cannot make any conditions on the truth, and truth
never makes any conditions on you. Neither can you make conditions on
God, nor does God ever make any conditions on you. All is given
unconditionally. You say, “I LIVE IN THE WORLD OF THE CONDITIONAL.”</p><p><br></p><p>That means you don’t live, you only pretend.</p><p><br></p><p>You say, “I LIVE IN COULD, SHOULD, WOULD, MAY, MIGHT AND IF.”</p><p>These are the words which belong to the world of death, not to the
world of life. Life simply is, it knows nothing of should, could, would.
Life simply is, it knows nothing of may, might. Life simply is, it knows
nothing of ifs and buts.</p><p><br></p><p>Live that which is, and WHATSOEVER it is. Yes, sometimes it hurts,
and hurts very much. Sometimes it brings great agonies, but those
agonies are the stepping stones to ecstasies, and those hurts are
nothing but birth pain. You have to accept the day and the night, birth
and death, summer and winter. You have to accept all that life is. You
cannot reject anything, you cannot make conditions on it. Your
conditions won’t make any difference, they will only drown you in your
own illusions.</p><p><br></p><p>Live in the is! The word ‘ought’ is a mind construction, avoid it.
You say, ” WHY AM I SO SECURE IN THIS ILLUSION?”</p><p>One can be secure only in illusions; there is no question of why. If
you find somebody who is secure, you can be certain he must be living in
illusions.</p><p><br></p><p>But insecurity has tremendous beauty; you have not tasted of it. You
have become too much accustomed to the dirty pool of water, stagnant,
stinking. You have forgotten the beauty of a river, constantly flowing
from the known to the unknown, from the limited to the unlimited. I have
to revive your memory of it. It is a remembering, because one day you
knew it.</p><p><br></p><p>When the child is born he knows nothing of security; he knows nothing
of the past, nothing of the future. He simply lives in the is; we drive
him out of the is. That’s what we call the process of civilizing a
child, that’s what we call education: driving him out of the is, taking
him out of life’s naturalness and making him arbitrary and artificial.
By the age of three or four a child becomes part of society; he loses
all contact with God and reality.</p><p><br></p><p>So you knew once what it means to be in insecurity. All that I need
is to remind you, to provoke that remembrance in you. And once you have
again tasted it you will drop all your illusions and you will start
moving into the unknown with all its insecurity.</p><p>And not that you will feel frightened – you will feel thrilled! You
will feel that insecurity is not something wrong but is the root of all
adventure. Insecurity is not something against you but is the very
possibility of your existence. It sharpens your intelligence, it keeps
you alive, alert. It keeps you always mystified, it keeps you in a state
of constant surprise.</p><p>Insecurity is beautiful. And the day you know insecurity is
beautiful, you have known the wisdom of insecurity, and you have
understood the very core of sannyas.</p><p><br></p><p>The fourth question:</p><p>OSHO, I AM A STAUNCH CATHOLIC. NOBODY CAN SHAKE MY BELIEFS, BUT WHY
DO I FEEL A LITTLE FRIGHTENED HERE?</p><p><br></p><p>Alexander,</p><p>YOU have fallen in wrong company! Escape from here as fast as
possible, because you are already shaken.</p><p><br></p><p>A belief has no roots; it is just an imposed phenomenon. Howsoever
staunchly you believe in it, it makes no difference. In fact, the more
you are afraid of losing it, the more staunchly you believe in it.
Whenever somebody says, “This is my strong belief”, know well that he is
afraid. Otherwise what does it mean? Why should he brag about his
staunchness? If he knows, he knows.</p><p><br></p><p>You know that the sun has risen, that it is day. You don’t say, “I
strongly believe that this is sunrise,” you simply say, “I know this is
sunrise.” You don’t say, “I strongly believe, nobody can shake my
belief.” If you say it people will think you are crazy. If you say it
people will think you must be blind; you are not seeing the sun, you
have only heard about it. Others must have told you and you are saying,
“I believe strongly.” Just to protect yourself you create a great armor
around yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>But a real experience needs no protection. The real experience needs
no bragging about being staunch. One simply knows or one knows not;
things are very simple.</p><p>You say, “I AM A STAUNCH CATHOLIC.”</p><p><br></p><p>It is just accidental that you were born in a Catholic house. If you
were born and brought up by a Hindu you would have been a staunch Hindu.
And if you were born in Soviet Russia and you were brought up by a
communist you would have been a staunch communist. Staunchness would
have remained the same, otherwise everything would have been different.
That staunchness simply shows that you are not intelligent.</p><p>An intelligent person does not believe; he tries to know, he
enquires. An intelligent person is neither Catholic nor Protestant; an
intelligent person is neither Hindu nor Mohammedan. An intelligent
person says, “I don’t know yet, so how can I claim what is right and
what is wrong? How can I say that the Bible is right and the Koran is
wrong, or vice versa?” The intelligent person is bound to say only one
thing, that “I don’t know, and I cannot carry any prejudice if I really
want to know.” He remains unprejudiced, open.</p><p><br></p><p>By being a Catholic you are closed, by being a Jain you are closed,
by being a Buddhist you are closed. You are not an enquirer, you are not
a seeker. You don’t love truth, you love security. Belief g ives you
secu rity.</p><p><br></p><p>And if you want to know the truth you have to begin with agnosticism,
you have to begin from the state of not knowing. Every true enquiry
starts only in not-knowing. One has to be clearly aware that “I don’t
know. But I have to seek, I have to search, I have to find, and I should
start without any a priori conception.”</p><p>That’s why you are becoming a little afraid, frightened. You may not
have landed in such a society before – these people are dangerous! Don’t
tell me later on that I didn’t give you the warning!</p><p><br></p><p>Alexander, please escape You don’t seem to be much of an Alexander
either, and certainly you are</p><p>not in good company.</p><p>Have you heard this story about Ferrara the Flyer during World War
II?</p><p><br></p><p>He’d never shot down a British plane and everybody in the squadron
kidded him about it.</p><p><br></p><p>One day while on patrol Ferrara spotted five British transport
planes. He zipped into their formation and shot down all five. Now he
couldn’t wait to tell his fellow pilots. Ferrara landed quickly, jumped
out of his plane and rushed over to a colonel standing beside a map
table. “I just-a shoot down fivea British-a transports!” shouted the
proud Italian.</p><p><br></p><p>“I say, bad luck, old chap!” replied the officer.</p><p><br></p><p>You are in a wrong place, old chap. You should not have landed
here!</p><p><br></p><p>You say, “NOBODY CAN SHAKE MY BELIEFS.”</p><p><br></p><p>But why do you say it? Why in the first place does the idea come to
your mind? I have not asked, nobody has asked. “Nobody can shake my
beliefs...” You are already shaking inside, I can see you trembling! And
it is natural, because you know that you don’t know, that those beliefs
are just borrowed by you from others. The priests have told you and you
have believed. You have believed because you were not really interested
in truth, so you said, “Okay.” You were not really caring enough about
truth so you said okay.</p><p>People are so uncaring about truth that they say, “Whatsoever you
say, it must be right. Who cares? I</p><p>am not interested enough to bother.”</p><p><br></p><p>That’s the situation in the world: a few are Christians, a few are
Hindus, a few are Mohammedans. If you look deeply into them you will see
that they don’t care whether God is or is not, they don’t care what
truth is. They have simply accepted the belief that the people around
them believe. It is formal, a social security. It feels good to be part
of the crowd, it feels good that others think that you are religious.
You are not religious!</p><p>It is not easy to be religious. It is one of the most dangerous
adventures of life, to be religious. It means dropping all the beliefs
and going into the unknown without any maps.</p><p>It is good if you allow us to destroy your beliefs. It is good and
will be healthy for you if you don’t</p><p>cling to your beliefs. And something seems to have started.</p><p>You say, “BUT WHY DO I FEEL A LITTLE FRIGHTENED HERE?”</p><p>You have started becoming alert that your Catholicism is phony. There
has been only one Christian, and he was crucified on the cross. Since
then there have not been any Christians.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, be a Christ, don’t be a Christian. Don’t disrespect yourself
by being a Christian. You are meant to be a Christ! You are meant to be
a Buddha, not to be a Buddhist. What is a Buddhist compared to being a
Buddha? – just a believer, not a seeker, not an enquirer. Go on the
voyage... the sea is calling you. Go alone, and go without maps and
without scriptures. And if you can drop all your scriptures and maps and
ideologies on THIS bank, the other bank is not far away.</p><p>The man who is utterly empty of knowledge is immediately worthy of
receiving from God the ultimate gift of knowing. Only those who renounce
knowledge become capable of knowing.</p><p>The fifth question:</p><p>OSHO, WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHEN YOU SAY, “MEDITATE OVER IT”? PLEASE
EXPLAIN IT IN</p><p>RELATION TO MY PROBLEM OF JEALOUSY?</p><p><br></p><p>Veetgyan,</p><p><br></p><p>WHEN I say meditate over it, I don’t mean think it over, I don’t mean
concentrate on it, I don’t mean contemplate it. When I say meditate over
it, I mean watch, be a witness. Whatsoever the problem – anger,
sexuality, jealousy, greed, ego – whatsoever the problem is, the
medicine is the same.</p><p><br></p><p>If you suffer from jealousy, just watch how it arises in you, how it
grabs you, how it surrounds you, clouds you, how it tries to manipulate
you, how it drags you into paths where you never wanted to go in the
first place, how finally it creates great frustration in you, how it
destroys your energy, dissipates your energy and leaves you very
negatively depressed, frustrated. Just watch the whole thing.</p><p><br></p><p>And remember not to condemn, because if you condemn you have started
thinking. I am not saying condemn it. Just see the facticity of it,
without condemnation, without appreciation, without any judgement for or
against. Just watch, aloof, distant, as if you have nothing to do with
it. Be very scientific in watching.</p><p><br></p><p>One of the most important scientific contributions to the world is
non -judgemental observation. When a scientist is experimenting he
simply experiments without any judgement, without any conclusion. If he
has a conclusion already in his mind, that means he is not a scientist;
his conclusion will influence the experiment.</p><p><br></p><p>One man has written a book.… In America people are very superstitious
and afraid of the number thirteen. Even in the hotels you will not find
room number thirteen. After twelve comes fourteen, because nobody stays,
nobody wants to stay, in the thirteenth room. You will not even find the
thirteenth floor – the whole floor is missing! After the twelfth, they
have the fourteenth, because who will want to stay on the thirteenth
floor?</p><p>One man has written a book, has collected thousands of facts – that
this is not a superstition, this is a truth. He has collected
information about all the people who have committed suicide on the date
the thirteenth. Of course millions of people murder, commit suicide, on
the thirteenth, as much as on the twelfth, as much as on the fourteenth,
but he collects only about the thirteenth. And many people commit
suicide from the thirteenth floor, and many people commit suicide in
room number thirteen. And many things happen – in the world things are
continuously happening. This man had brought his thesis to show me, and
I told him, “You have really done a great job!”</p><p>He said, “I have been working at it for almost five years.” He has
gathered millions of facts! He said, “Now who can say that this is
superstition?”</p><p>I said, “You do one thing more – it will take five years again – now
you try to find out about number</p><p>twelve!”</p><p>He already had a conclusion: the thirteenth number was wrong,
something was evil about it; with that idea he had chosen.</p><p><br></p><p>And I said, “Do one thing more – after you are finished with number
twelve, then for five years more you will have to do another experiment:
find out how many good things happen on number thirteen. Room number
thirteen, the thirteenth storey of the hotel, the thirteenth day of the
month – find out how many good things happen. Only then can your
conclusion be of any scientific value. You are already prejudiced.”</p><p><br></p><p>A Hindu psychologist, Doctor Banaji, came to see me once. He said, “I
am trying to scientifically prove that rebirth is a fact and not a
hypothesis.”</p><p>I asked him, “Doctor Banaji, you say you are trying to scientifically
prove it?” He said, “Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “But if you are trying to prove something scientifically, you
should not have any conclusion beforehand. You have already accepted the
Hindu idea of rebirth. You are working as a Hindu, not as a
scientist.”</p><p><br></p><p>He was so angry, because he had come to me for support for his
belief. I said, “I am not saying anything against your belief; I am not
saying whether rebirth is a fact or not. All I am saying is this: don’t
bring science into it. If you bring science into it, then the
fundamental law of science is: be an unprejudiced, non -judgemental
observer, without any a priori conclusion.”</p><p><br></p><p>A priori conclusions make you believers, not scientists.</p><p><br></p><p>When I say meditate over it, I mean watch. Be a scientist in your
inner world. Let your mind be your lab, and you observe – with no
condemnation, remember. Don’t say, “Jealousy is bad.” Who knows? Don’t
say, “Anger is bad.” Who knows? Yes, you have heard, you have been told,
but that is what others say, this is not your experience. And you have
to be very existential, experiential: unless your experiment proves it,
you are not to say yes or no to anything. You have to be utterly non -
judgemental. And then watching jealousy or anger or sex is a
miracle.</p><p>What happens when you watch without any judgement? You start seeing
through and through. Jealousy becomes transparent: you see the stupidity
of it, you see the foolishness of it. Not that you have already decided
that it is stupid; if you have decided you will miss the whole point.
Remember it: I am not saying decide it is stupid, it is foolish. If you
decide, you miss the whole point.</p><p><br></p><p>You simply go without any decision, just to see what exactly it is.
What is this jealousy? What is this energy called jealousy? And watch it
as you watch a rose flower – just look into it. When there is no
conclusion your eyes are clear; the clarity is attained only by those
who have no conclusions. Watch, look into it, and it will become
transparent, and you WILL come to know that it is stupid. And knowing
its stupidity, it drops of its own accord. You don’t need to drop
it.</p><p>Mrs. Weissman had her portrait painted. When it was finished, the
artist presented it to her. “How do</p><p>you like it?” he asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s nice,” answered Mrs. Weissman, “but I want you should add a
gold bracelet on each wrist; a pearl necklace, ruby earrings, an emerald
tiara, and on each finger I want you to put a twenty-carat diamond
ring!”</p><p><br></p><p>“But,” said the bewildered artist, “why do you want to ruin a good
picture with all those gaudy trinkets?”</p><p><br></p><p>“My husband is running around with a young chippie,” explained Mrs.
Weissman, “and when I die, I want her to go crazy looking for the
jewelry.”</p><p>Just look into your jealousy and you will see how it drives you
crazy! Seeing it, sanity arises – just seeing it!</p><p>I am not saying renounce jealousy. Those who say renounce jealousy
don’t understand a thing. I am saying: look, watch, meditate, and if it
is stupid it will drop – because how can you carry anything stupid with
yourself? But its stupidity has to be your own experience. If it is not
your own, then you will only repress, you will condemn. You will not
look into it. You will throw it into the basement of your unconscious
and there it will boil, and there it will grow. And the growth is more
dangerous because it will be growing underground. It will become a
cancerous growth, it will spread all over your life. And you will wait
simply for the opportunity: it will explode sooner or later. Any day it
will explode, and it will destroy you.</p><p><br></p><p>Paddy and his two friends, an Englishman and a Scotsman, got
sentenced to five years in jail, but were told that they could have one
thing with them that they badly wanted. The Englishman had a big blonde,
the Scotsman had bottles of whisky, and Paddy chose packets and packets
of cigarettes. Five years came and they were all let out, one by one.
The Englishman came out with his blonde, looking absolutely knackered,
the Scotsman came out staggering all over, and hiccupping. And last of
all out came Paddy, of course, looking very frustrated. And do you know
what his first words were? “Have you got a light, anybody?”</p><p><br></p><p>CHAPTER 4</p><p><br></p><p>The guest waits for you to die</p><p><br></p><p>2 9 A p r i l 1 9 7 9 a m i n B u d d h a H a l l</p><p>MY BODY AND MY MIND ARE IN DEPRESSION BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT WITH
ME.</p><p>HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU AND WANT YOU IN MY HOUSE! WHEN I HEAR PEOPLE

NEVER MET.</p><p>THEN WHAT IS THIS LOVE OF MINE?</p><p><br></p><p>I DON’T REALLY CARE ABOUT FOOD, I DON’T REALLY CARE ABOUT SLEEP,</p><p>I AM RESTLESS INDOORS AND OUTDOORS. THE BRIDE WANTS HER LOVER</p><p><br></p><p>AS MUCH AS A THIRSTY MAN WANTS WATER. AND HOW WILL I FIND SOMEONE</p><p>WHO WILL TAKE A MESSAGE TO THE GUEST FROM ME? HOW RESTLESS KABIR IS
ALL THE TIME!</p><p><br></p><p>HOW MUCH HE WANTS TO SEE THE GUEST!</p><p><br></p><p>ARISTOTLE defines man as the rational animal; no definition can be
more false than this. Man is the most irrational animal, because man is
not conscious yet. Reason is possible only as a by-product of
consciousness. Man is asleep, man is dreaming. How can he be rational?
He has no eyes to see, he has no awareness to know, he is utterly
confused.</p><p>Man is a confusion, confusion between the body and the soul,
confusion between the material and the spiritual, confusion between
logic and love. Out of this confusion there is no possibility of knowing
God. Out of this confusion you can go on crying and praying, but your
prayer will never reach to the divine, your crying is futile. Out of
this confusion you will not be able to see the light. This confusion has
to be dropped.</p><p>One has to become intensely aware or intensely loving. These are the
only two keys which can bring man out of the state he is in: either
intense awareness – that is the path of meditation – or intense, total
love – that is the path of devotion.</p><p><br></p><p>Kabir is a devotee: he is on the path of love. He will talk of love
again and again, but what he means by love has to be understood well. By
love he means an intense desire to disappear into the whole. It is not
the love you know of, that you talk about; it is a totally different
phenomenon. Your love is an effort to dominate the other; it is a
strategy to possess the other, to exploit the other. Kabir is not
talking about that love. You cannot possess God, you can only be
possessed by God.</p><p>To love God means to surrender, to trust, to be ready to die into
Him, because dying in God is the beginning of a new life; it is
resurrection. Love has to become such an intense flame that it bums you
out, that you are not left behind, that you are consumed in it. If you
are not, the Guest comes.</p><p><br></p><p>This paradox has to be understood: the Guest cannot come if the host
is very much there; the Guest can come only when the host is not there
at all. In fact, that’s what it really means to be a host: absent,
utterly absent, with no ego, with no idea of ‘I’ within you; just an
utter, pure emptiness, then you are a host. When the host is not there,
then you are really a host. And then not even a split second is lost and
the Guest comes.</p><p><br></p><p>The Guest does not come from the outside, hence there is no time gap.
The dying of the host is the resurrection of the Guest. You are the
host, you are the Guest! If you live with the I you remain a host,
unacquainted with the Guest. If you drop the I, you are the Guest.</p><p>But before man can attain to such intensity, either of awareness or
of love – the real thing is intensity; neither does awareness matter nor
love; what matters is intensity, total intensity – before that total</p><p><br></p><p>intensity can happen you have to be perfectly conscious of your
unconsciousness. Man is so unconscious that he is not even conscious of
his unconsciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>Just the other day Mulla Nasrudin was telling me: “I had eighteen
bottles of whisky in my cellar and was told by my wife to empty the
contents of each and every bottle down the sink, or else. I said I would
and proceeded with the unpleasant task. I withdrew the cork from the
first bottle and poured the contents down the sink with the exception of
one glass which I drank. I extracted the cork from the second bottle and
I did likewise with it with the exception of one glass, which I drank. I
then withdrew the cork from the third bottle and poured the whisky down
the sink which I drank. I pulled the cork from the fourth bottle down
the sink and poured the bottle from the cork of the next and drank one
sink out of it and threw the rest down the glass. I pulled the sink out
of the next glass and poured the cork down the bottle. Then I corked the
sink with the glass, bottled the drink and drank the pour. When I had
everything emptied, I steadied the house with me hand, counted the
glasses, corks, bottles and sinks with the other, which were 29, and as
the house came by, I counted them again and finally had all the houses
in one bottle, which I drank. I’m not under the affluence of oncohol, as
some tinkle peep I am, I’m not half as thunk as you might drink. I fool
so feelish I don’t know who is me, and the drunker I stand here the
longer I get. Ah me!”</p><p><br></p><p>This is precisely the situation man is in. One is not aware of who
one is, one is not aware of from where one is, one is not aware of where
one is going. One is not aware of why one is at all, why this whole
existence is. One simply goes on like a robot, doing things, managing
somehow.</p><p>From birth to death man is a long sleep, sometimes dreaming with eyes
closed, sometimes dreaming with eyes open, but dreaming all the same,
all the time.</p><p><br></p><p>This situation cannot allow you to invite the Guest. In this
situation you cannot know what God is, because God is nothing but the
name of the totality. You don’t even know yourself, how can you know the
total? Even the small part of your being – you are just a tiny being
compared to this great, vast existence, you are just a dewdrop compared
to the ocean of existence – and you don’t know even the dewdrop, and you
start enquiring about the ocean.</p><p>Hence all philosophy is foolish. Philosophy is bound to be foolish
because it enquires about the ocean without knowing the dewdrop.
Religion is very sane: it starts by enquiring into the dewdrop.</p><p>The first and the most fundamental question of religion is not God
but ‘Who am I?’ One who starts with this question, ‘Who am I?’, is
moving in the right direction. But remember, this question should not be
just an intellectual enquiry. You should not ask this question with the
expectation that somebody else is going to answer it; nobody can answer
it for you. You cannot borrow the answer from any source, the Bible, the
Veda, the Koran. No Buddha can be of any help as far as the answer is
concerned.</p><p><br></p><p>Then what is the purpose of the Buddhas? – to make it clear to you
that your question is unanswerable, that your question has to become an
inner quest. You should not look out for the answer, you should look in
for the answer. The question is hiding the answer in itself – if you go
deep down into the question you will find the answer.</p><p>The answer has to become your own realization. It cannot be through
the scriptures, it cannot be through the sermons of those who are
awakened. It can only be through your own awakening,</p><p><br></p><p>through your own enlightenment; there is no other way, there is no
shortcut. There is no way to get the answer cheaply. You will have to
dive deep into your being, you will have to risk.</p><p><br></p><p>Why do I call it a risk? The greatest risk is to dive deep within
oneself, because when you dive deep within yourself you come across
abysmal emptiness, and it frightens. And there are only two possible
ways: either to be superstitious and just go into it with all your
superstitions... you will miss. The superstitious person can never
become religious. He believes, but his belief is blind, and if your
belief is blind you cannot open your eyes. If you begin with blindness
you will end with blindness.</p><p>The other possibility is doubt – one is superstition, blind belief,
the other is doubt. If you doubt, you cannot dive; if you believe, you
dive but in vain. And these seem to be the immediately available
alternatives; the third is not so immediately clear.</p><p><br></p><p>The third is an intelligent trust. Again a paradox! You have always
thought of trust as needing no intelligence; you have always thought of
intelligence as sceptical. You have never thought of the beautiful
synthesis, the harmony, of intelligence and trust. When intelligence and
trust meet. when you dive deep but fully aware – fully aware of the risk
– when you dive into your being risking all, gambling, but knowing,
knowing perfectly that you may simply be entering into something from
which there may be no return – you may be dying and there may be no
resurrection – not even a perhaps in the mind; risking without motive,
risking intelligently, seeing that the life outside is futile – you have
seen it, you have lived it, you have been through it, and enough is
enough – you are ready to risk the inner journey intelligently. But
remember, I say intelligently; love has not to be blind.</p><p><br></p><p>Ordinarily that’s what your love is: it is emotional blindness; it is
sentimentality, it is not intelligence.</p><p>And unless love has the quality of intelligence it is not love – not
the love that Kabir is talking about. There are two stories to be
pondered over.…</p><p>There is this guy from India and he is walking along a cliff, falls
off, grabs the branch and pleads, “Is there anyone up there? Help
me!”</p><p>God answers true to form, “Trust me – let go!”</p><p><br></p><p>The guy does, and immediately falls to his death on the rocks
below.</p><p><br></p><p>God speaks again through the clouds, “That will teach you, you stupid
Indian!”</p><p><br></p><p>And the second story.…</p><p><br></p><p>A Jew is walking along a cliff, falls off, grabs the branch and
pleads, “Is there anyone up there? Help</p><p>me!”</p><p><br></p><p>God answers, “Trust me – let go!”</p><p><br></p><p>The Jew thinks for a minute, then with eyes uplifted to the sky,
says, “Is there anyone ELSE up there?”</p><p><br></p><p>These are the two alternatives, simple alternatives, available:
either blindly believe – but remember, God is not available to blind,
superstitious people – or blindly doubt God is not available to them
either. God is available to intelligent enquirers.</p><p><br></p><p>What is intelligent enquiry? The first requirement is to be a little
more conscious than you are. Whatsoever you are doing, bring the quality
of consciousness into it. Walking, remember ‘I am walking.’ Not that you
have to repeat these words, ‘I am walking’, just remain alert that you
are walking. Drinking water, remember you are drinking. Remember it is
cool, remember it is quenching the thirst, not afterwards, not when the
thirst is quenched, not when it has become a past thing but when it is
on the way, when the process is happening, when really the thirst is
being quenched; not when it has become a noun but when it is a verb,
still alive, vibrating. Feel the coolness of the water in your throat,
the quenching of the thirst – not afterwards, let me repeat, not even a
split second later.</p><p><br></p><p>Eating, working, taking a bath, whatsoever you are doing, bring the
quality of awareness so that awareness becomes soaked into your being.
Then only will you be able to become a conscious lover, because love is
one of the deepest phenomena. Unless you are aware, conscious in your
ordinary life, you will not be conscious in your love. And conscious
love is prayer.</p><p><br></p><p>If love is not conscious it remains lust, and lust can never have
anything of prayer in it. Lust is unconscious, love is conscious.</p><p>The lush staggered into the heart of Lover’s Lane, blundered into the
parked convertibles and caused a minor commotion. Just then a young man
appeared from the shadows, breathing heavily.</p><p>“Wow!’ he exclaimed,”what a dynamo! A woman like that would kill you
in no time flat – she’d burn a guy up!”</p><p><br></p><p>“So what?” slobbered the drunk.</p><p><br></p><p>“I’m bushed, pal,” said the fellow, “want to take over for me a
while? I gotta rest up.”</p><p>“Glad to, buddy, ol’ pal,” mumbled the drunk, as he blundered his way
to a parked car nearby. He had no sooner made himself comfortable than a
police car drove up and a flashlight flooded the darkened convertible
with its strong beam. “C’mon you two, break it up,” snarled the Law.</p><p><br></p><p>“But offisher,” protested the lush, “this is my wife!” “Sorry mister,
didn’t know it was your wife.” “Neither did I until the lights went
on!”</p><p><br></p><p>You don’t know what you are doing. You call your lust love, you call
your desire to possess love, you call your exploitation love. You use
the other person and you call it caring. You don’t know what you are
doing; you can’t know, unless you start becoming aware and alert about
small things first. One has to learn swimming in shallow water.</p><p><br></p><p>When you have gone for a morning walk, try to remember. Be mindful,
alert. Whatsoever is happening, don’t exclude anything: the distant call
of the bird, be aware of it... and the car that has passed by... and a
child crying in some house. Be alert to everything, inclusive of all.
Just be alert.</p><p><br></p><p>It will be difficult – only once in a while will you be alert and
again you will become unconscious; the unconscious is such an old,
ancient habit. But slowly, slowly a part of you will be freed. In the
beginning it will be only the tip of the iceberg, but that is the
beginning of a great revolution in your life. And then you can start
moving your light of awareness onto deeper things.</p><p><br></p><p>And love is the deepest. When love and consciousness meet, prayer
arises. These songs of Kabir are his prayer.</p><p><br></p><p>Kabir says:</p><p><br></p><p>MY BODY AND MY MIND ARE IN DEPRESSION BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT WITH
ME.</p><p>Man without God is a corpse, man with God is a celebration. Minus God
or plus God – these are the only two ways to live your life. Minus God
you are nothing but misery, plus God you are nothing but bliss. Minus
God you are a negative, black hole. Minus God you only pretend to live,
you cannot live. How can there be life minus God? God is life! Yes, you
go through all the empty motions, gestures, you ACT as if you are alive;
deep down you know you are not alive, life has not yet happened to you.
Birth has happened but not life.</p><p>Life happens only when God has happened. Then a man is twice-born. In
the East we call him DWIJA, twiceborn. Then a man really becomes a
Brahmin, not by birth; nobody can be a Brahmin by birth.</p><p><br></p><p>The word ‘brahmin’ does not mean a caste; it means one who has known
the Brahma, one who has known God, one who has become one with God. A
Brahmin is never born, a Brahmin is resurrected. One has to die first to
all that one thinks one is; then one is reborn, twice-born.</p><p><br></p><p>With God, your life really begins. You start pulsating on a new
plane, radiating joy. Your life takes the color of the rainbow; you are
all the colors, the whole spectrum. Your life becomes music, ALL THE
NOTES; you become an orchestra. Each moment it goes on deeper, becomes
more and more sweet. You start having a love affair with existence for
the first time.</p><p>The world remains the same and yet not the same. The trees are
greener than they had ever been before, and the roses are rosier. And
the people are no longer ordinary people: each person represents a facet
of God, a face of God.</p><p>Knowing God, your life starts soaring high for the first time, you
have wings. Minus God you are just crawling in the mud, plus God you can
fly to the sun. The flight Of the alone to the alone becomes
possible.</p><p><br></p><p>Kabir says:</p><p><br></p><p>BALAM AVO HAMARE GEH RE...</p><p><br></p><p>Oh my beloved, when are you going to enter into my house, into my
being?</p><p><br></p><p>... TUM BIN DUKHIYA DEH RE...</p><p><br></p><p>Without you, my body aches,</p><p><br></p><p>my body is nothing but pain, my body is nothing but agony. Without
you I live in agony.</p><p>How much longer do I have to live this way? How much longer do I have
to call you forth?</p><p>MY BODY AND MY MIND ARE IN DEPRESSION BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT WITH
ME.</p><p><br></p><p>And I know why I am in such despair, in such anguish. I know
perfectly well it is not because I don’t have much money, no. It is not
because I am not politically powerful, no. It is not because I am not
very respected, no. I have come to find the basic thing: it is because
you are not with me.</p><p><br></p><p>Have you come upon this basic fundamental of life? People go on
thinking they will be happy if they have a little more money; or if they
are more respectable, more famous, more known; or if they have more
power, more prestige. People go on thinking that this is missing, that
is missing, and even when they get those things they don’t see; they
again start thinking of something else. You were thinking that if you
had one million rupees you would be happy; now you have, but you don’t
see the futility of it. By the time you have one million, you start
thinking that unless you have ten million you are not going to be happy.
What is one million, after all? – unless it is ten.… And remember, this
is going to happen again when you have ten million.</p><p><br></p><p>Your desires go on projecting into the future. The desiring mind
never ends desiring. You can provide each and every thing that it
desires, but it can always find more to desire; the more is always
there. The desire for more is the basic root of the mind.</p><p>Look back at many things you had thought: if you had this woman, this
man, you would be happy. Now you have that woman, that man – are you
happy? No, now you are thinking, “Some other woman, some other man,” and
the same will be repeated.</p><p><br></p><p>To go on repeating this vicious circle is what I mean by stupidity;
you are not intelligent then.</p><p><br></p><p>Kabir is showing his intelligence. He says: I have come to know, only
one thing is missing in my life, and that is you – God is missing. I am
minus you; that’s my misery. And I am just pain and nothing else, pain
all over. My body is pain, my mind is pain, I am aching all over. This
is just agony!</p><p><br></p><p>Without God there can be no ecstasy.</p><p><br></p><p>HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU AND WANT YOU IN MY HOUSE!</p><p><br></p><p>Can’t you see how much I love you and want you in my house, in my
temple, in my heart? What is missing? he is asking. Is not my love
enough yet? Is there something wrong with my love? Is my love still
lukewarm, not intense enough, not boiling at a hundred degrees? You just
tell me!</p><p>WHEN I HEAR PEOPLE DESCRIBE ME AS YOUR BRIDE I LOOK SIDEWAYS
ASHAMED.</p><p>And I am very much ashamed, because people have already started
talking about me as your bride.</p><p><br></p><p>People have started saying about me</p><p><br></p><p>that I am married to God.</p><p><br></p><p>People have started saying about me that I have reached the beloved,
that I have found the beloved.</p><p><br></p><p>I feel very ashamed.</p><p>Yes, glimpses have happened;</p><p><br></p><p>I have seen you from a faraway distance...</p><p><br></p><p>... just as you can see the Himalayan peaks from thousands of miles
away on a clear day. In the sunlight you can see those virgin peaks and
the snow-from thousands of miles away. Just like that, I have seen a few
glimpses of you, but I have not yet melted in you and I have not yet
found you in my heart. In the depths we have not met, only on the
circumference. Yes, a few meetings have happened; those meetings can
only be called acquaintances. I am introduced to you, you are introduced
to me, that’s true... and people have started describing me as your
bride.</p><p><br></p><p>SAB KOI KAHE TUMHARI NARI, MOKO LAGAT LAJ RE...</p><p><br></p><p>Everybody is talking, the news has reached to many that Kabir has
attained.</p><p><br></p><p>Kabir is very authentic and very true. He says: Only a few glimpses
have happened; this is not attainment. In fact I have never been in more
misery than I am now. When I had not seen your face at all, I was far
happier because I was far more unconscious. Before I had ever seen you I
had no</p><p><br></p><p>idea that you are, hence there was no misery. I was not missing you
at all. Since I have seen your face from far away, since a few glimpses
have entered into my being, since like lightning, sometimes you have
happened in my dark night of the soul, the darkness is far more dark
than ever before. Now I know the anguish because I have seen the joy.
Now I know the agony because I have felt the ecstasy. Now I know where I
am – utterly useless is my existence without you.</p><p><br></p><p>And people have started talking of me as your bride; I look sideways
ashamed. I cannot deny that I am your bride. From my side that is true,
but it has not happened from your side yet. From my side I am ready, but
you have not accepted me, you have not shown any indication that you
have accepted me. I cannot say that the people are wrong; the marriage
has happened at least as far as I am concerned. I am married to you, I
cannot live without you. I will wait for you for infinity. I cannot fall
into the trap of the world again; even if I have to wait forever and
ever, I will wait. From my side I am married to you, wedded to you, but
what about you? You have not yet entered into my heart. What is
missing?</p><p>That’s how real prayer arises: it simply asks, “You must be ready to
come, but something is missing in me. I desire, but my desire must not
be pure. I love, but there must be a shadow of lust in it.”</p><p><br></p><p>WHEN I HEAR PEOPLE DESCRIBE ME AS YOUR BRIDE I LOOK SIDEWAYS
ASHAMED,</p><p>BECAUSE I KNOW THAT FAR INSIDE US WE HAVE NEVER MET.</p><p>Saying that needs courage, and for a man like Kabir... he was already
known as one of the enlightened. Thousands had come to him, hundreds
were his followers. It needs courage to say it so truly: that deep down,
far inside us, we have never met. Circumferences have overlapped, yes,
there has been a certain kind of meeting, but at the centers no meeting
has happened yet. There has not been an orgasmic unity yet, we have not
made love to each other yet. I have not penetrated you, you have not
penetrated me; we are poles apart. And people are talking, and I feel
ashamed.</p><p><br></p><p>Then what is this love of mine? Why is this meeting in the depth not
happening? Then what is this love of mine, you tell me!</p><p>This is how a devotee prays.</p><p><br></p><p>Prayer is a dialogue, a dialogue with the whole. No answer comes from
the other side. The devotee goes on asking, enquiring, praying,
demanding, complaining, thanking – no answer ever comes. It looks like a
monologue to the outsider; if you see a devotee of the caliber of Kabir
it will look like a monologue: “With whom is he talking? has he gone
mad?” – because there is nobody else.</p><p><br></p><p>But as far as Kabir is concerned it is a dialogue, it is not a
monologue. Response may not come, the beloved may remain silent, but His
silence is so tangible and His presence is so tangible, he can touch it.
He may not say a single word but He is there; now there is no missing
about it.</p><p><br></p><p>Kabir knows God is, he has seen the glimpses. Kabir knows that God
loves him, he has seen those few moments of joy too.</p><p><br></p><p>But when you know, and sometimes light happens in your darkness,
great desire, great longing, arises to end this night completely, to
reach to the dawn.</p><p>THEN WHAT IS THIS LOVE OF MINE?</p><p><br></p><p>If there is something wrong with me, you tell me. If there is
something missing, I will try hard. I will cleanse my heart if it is not
ready to receive you. I will prepare, I will learn the art of being a
host – you just tell me what is missing.</p><p>I DON’T REALLY CARE ABOUT FOOD, I</p><p><br></p><p>DON’T REALLY CARE ABOUT SLEEP,</p><p><br></p><p>I AM RESTLESS INDOORS AND OUTDOORS.</p><p><br></p><p>The devotee knows a totally different kind of restlessness than you
have known. Your restlessness is very mundane, superficial. You are
restless for money, power, this and that – a better house, more money in
the bank, a little more of a prestigious life so you can brag that you
are somebody – but you don’t know the restlessness of a devotee. He
cannot say it to anybody, he cannot show it to anybody, nobody will ever
understand. He will be thought crazy, he will be thought mad.</p><p><br></p><p>And his restlessness is not on the surface. On the surface Kabir will
be found utterly calm and quiet, but his heart is burning, his heart is
on fire. Only those who know what love is, what devotion is, will
understand the pain, the suffering of Kabir. On the surface, those who
don’t know about the heart will see Kabir so quiet, so silent, so still,
and deep down he is carrying a storm.</p><p><br></p><p>I AM RESTLESS INDOORS AND OUTDOORS.</p><p>I don’t care about food and I don’t care about sleep. My whole
concern is you, my whole concentration is you. Day in, day out, I only
think about you. I simply wait at the door and wait for you. The wind
comes and knocks on the door; I rush to the door to open – maybe He has
come? Dry leaves move on the street with the wind, I rush – maybe these
are the sounds of his footsteps?</p><p><br></p><p>I cannot sleep, Kabir says, I cannot eat. I am so full of you that
there is no space left in me for anything else. Still something is
missing. What is that?</p><p><br></p><p>THE BRIDE WANTS HER LOVER</p><p><br></p><p>AS MUCH AS A THIRSTY MAN WANTS WATER.</p><p>Just like a fish thrown on the bank, I am thirsty for you, dying for
you, but still you have not arrived. And you cannot be wrong so I must
be wrong. It seems that still my thirst is not enough, my longing is not
intense. I have not yet prayed and called you. It seems my host is still
unworthy of receiving you.</p><p><br></p><p>AND HOW WILL I FIND SOMEONE WHO WILL TAKE A MESSAGE TO THE GUEST FROM
ME?</p><p><br></p><p>And I go on calling and you don’t answer, and sometimes the doubt
arises whether my words reach to you, whether you hear me, whether you
care about me. Yes, suspicions arise, doubts arise. There are moments
when I start losing hope, when hopelessness settles into me, when the
despair is so much that I start thinking that if there were somebody to
take the message to you...</p><p><br></p><p>Kabir is saying: Where can I find a Master who can become a bridge
between me and you, whom I can tell, and trust that the message will be
delivered to you, who can answer on my behalf? Where can I find a
Master?</p><p><br></p><p>The story of Kabir is of tremendous beauty. It is said that he was
born into a Mohammedan family. Nothing is absolutely certain, but he was
abandoned by the parents and he was brought up by a Hindu family. But
the suspicion was there always that he was born a Mohammedan, brought up
by a Hindu. He had knocked on many so-called gurus’ doors and they would
not accept him because he was a Mohammedan, or even if he was not, at
least his birth was suspicious, uncertain. He must have been an illegal
child, maybe – why was he abandoned? The parents had simply thrown the
child on the bank of the river. Somebody found him and brought him up.
Nobody would accept him. His name also shows that he was a Mohammedan;
Kabir is one of the names of God given by the Sufis.</p><p><br></p><p>Sufis have a hundred names for God – ninety-nine can verbally be
communicated, the hundredth cannot be communicated verbally; that is
understood only in deep silence between the Master and the disciple. Out
of those ninety-nine names, one is Kabir. Kabir literally means ‘the
great, the vast, the infinite’. Kabir is not a Hindu name,
certainly.</p><p>His name was Mohammedan, his birth suspicious – who would accept him?
And the so-called Masters were afraid; he was rejected.</p><p>Then he played a trick. He wanted to become a disciple of the great
Ramananda, a very famous Master, but he was afraid to go to him – maybe
he would not accept him, just as others had not accepted him. And once
he had rejected, then it would be very difficult to make his no into a
yes, so he played a trick.</p><p><br></p><p>Ramananda used to go to the Ganges in Varanasi to take his morning
bath, early, when it was dark and the sun had not risen yet. Kabir went
there, slept on a step where he knew Ramananda would pass. It was dark
and Ramananda’s feet touched Kabir – Kabir clung to the feet. Ramananda
said, “Hey Ram! My God! Who are you, and what are you doing here?”</p><p><br></p><p>Kabir said, “Forget all about it. But you have given me the mantra
‘Hey Ram’. You have initiated me, now I am your disciple.”</p><p>This is how he got initiated into disciplehood. It was only later on,
when the sun rose, that Ramananda became aware that it was Kabir.
Everybody knew about him, that he was knocking on every door asking to
be initiated. Ordinarily it is the Masters who create devices to
initiate the</p><p><br></p><p>disciples, but in Kabir’s case it was Kabir the disciple who created
a device to be initiated by the Master. Now Ramananda could not go back
on his word. He said, “That’s true, this is your mantra – hey Ram, oh
God – and you are my disciple.”</p><p><br></p><p>He says: It is very difficult to find a Master. AND HOW WILL I FIND
SOMEONE</p><p>WHO WILL TAKE A MESSAGE TO THE GUEST FROM ME?</p><p>This song must have been sung before he met Ramananda. HOW RESTLESS
KABIR IS ALL THE TIME!</p><p><br></p><p>HOW MUCH HE WANTS TO SEE THE GUEST!</p><p>HAI KOI AISA PAR-UPAKARI. PIVSON KAHE SUNAY RE...</p><p><br></p><p>The original is:</p><p><br></p><p>Is there anybody in the whole world</p><p><br></p><p>who has any compassion on this poor man?</p><p><br></p><p>Because I have a message to be delivered to my beloved. Is there
somebody compassionate enough in the world who can deliver my message to
God?</p><p><br></p><p>... PIVSON KAHE SUNAY RE...</p><p><br></p><p>One who can go to the beloved, one who knows the way, one who knows
the beloved, one who knows His address. I don’t know His address, I
don’t know His way,</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t know His house, where He resides. I go on calling for
Him,</p><p>not knowing in what direction to call, not knowing with what name to
call. Is there somebody in the world</p><p><br></p><p>who is compassionate enough</p><p><br></p><p>to take my message to my beloved?</p><p>just to tell Him, “There is a madman</p><p><br></p><p>dying in deep love for you,”</p><p><br></p><p>and if there is any fault, just tell me, and I will drop it.</p><p><br></p><p>I am ready to risk all,</p><p><br></p><p>but I don’t know what to drop.</p><p><br></p><p>HOW RESTLESS KABIR IS ALL THE TIME!</p><p><br></p><p>Cannot someone go and say to God how restless I am? My heart is
burning,</p><p>I am constantly crying and weeping.</p><p><br></p><p>AB TO BEHAL KABIR BHAYO HAI, BIN DEKHE JIV JAYE RE...</p><p><br></p><p>Now the situation is such: Trust me, says Kabir. Now things have come
to such a point –</p><p>if you don’t show up I will die.</p><p>I cannot remain alive any more without you.</p><p><br></p><p>... BIN DEKHE JIV JAYE RE...</p><p>If I cannot see you, I cannot live any more. I am finished! Either
you come or I am going to die. I am breathing my last.</p><p>AB TO BEHAL KABIR BHAYO...</p><p>Kabir has come to such a state</p><p><br></p><p>where only death seems to be possible. Either you appear, or I
disappear.</p><p><br></p><p>And this is the point where the Guest appears, this is the point
where the meeting happens. In fact to call it a meeting is not right,
because a meeting needs two, and THIS meeting happens only when you are
not.</p><p><br></p><p>In another song Kabir sings – it must have been composed after the
meeting; he says: In the beginning I used to seek and search for
you,</p><p><br></p><p>and I was at a loss, I was continuously frustrated.</p><p><br></p><p>I used to seek and search for you and there was no sign of you.</p><p>Now you seek and search for me, and you will not find me
anywhere.</p><p>HERAT HERAT HE SAKHI, RAHYA KABIR HERAI...</p><p><br></p><p>Seeking and seeking, searching and searching for the beloved... a
moment came,</p><p>the beloved was not found but the seeker disappeared. And the moment
the seeker disappeared,</p><p>the sought was found,</p><p>because it is the seeker that is hiding the sought.</p><p><br></p><p>The seeker is the last citadel of the ego, the very last citadel of
the ego, where the ego hides. It becomes the seeker, the great seeker;
it becomes the devotee. The ego can take any form, remember, and the
subtlest form is that of a devotee, a humble devotee, a surrendered
devotee.</p><p>Beware of the subtle ways of the ego! It has to die totally. One has
to come to a point where one finds oneself not, where one is just utter
nothingness; that is the point of the meeting. When you are not, God
is.</p><p><br></p><p>HOW RESTLESS KABIR IS ALL THE TIME! HOW MUCH HE WANTS TO SEE THE
GUEST!</p><p>This longing to see the Guest, this desire to see the Guest, brings
you a long way. But finally, ultimately, even this desire has to be
dropped.</p><p><br></p><p>There is a very famous story about another mystic, a contemporary of
Kabir, Sheikh Farid.</p><p><br></p><p>Farid was going to the river to take his bath. A young man asked him,
“Can you tell me how to find God?”</p><p>Farid looked at the young man with very penetrating eyes, and he
looked for a long time, and the young man started feeling frightened.
And then Farid said, “You come along with me to the river. First take a
bath, and if I get an opportunity I will answer it while we are taking
the bath, or if not then later on.”</p><p><br></p><p>The young man was puzzled: “What does he mean? I have asked a simple
question – how to find God? – and he is talking in puzzles. Bathing in
the river, if he gets the opportunity he will answer. Why can’t he
answer right now?”</p><p><br></p><p>But knowing that the ways of the mystics are mysterious, strange, and
the man looked very magnetic, and the way he had looked into his eyes...
he FELT like going with him. He was a little afraid, scared, but still
the attraction was so much that he followed. He said, “Let us take the
risk – what can he do?”</p><p><br></p><p>They both went into the river, and when the young man dived into the
river Farid caught hold of him under the water and wouldn’t allow him to
come out of the water; he forced his head deeper and deeper. Farid was a
strong man and the young man must not have been very strong, because
strong people don’t ask such questions, such philosophical questions:
How to find God? What is God? These enquiries are philosophical; fragile
people ask them. Really strong people start the journey rather than
asking here and there; rather than becoming philosophical they become
religious.</p><p><br></p><p>The young man was dying, but when you are dying, suddenly a great
energy arises in you. When it is such a risk, you cannot afford to be
half-hearted. His whole energy became available to him, which had never
before been available.</p><p>You know only the first layer of your energy, which is very ordinary;
it is enough for day-to-day work, then it’s exhausted. You need sleep to
become refreshed again. The second layer is the emergency layer; it
arises only when you are in an emergency. For example, if somebody is
with a bayonet, or a lion is following you in the forest, then you will
run! No Olympic runner can compete with you – and you don’t know how to
run but it will come, it will happen. When life is in danger the second
layer is available. And when life is really in danger, totally in
danger, absolutely in danger...</p><p><br></p><p>And so was the case with the young man. Farid was a strong man and he
was not leaving him, he was forcing him down and down. The third layer
became available; the third layer is inexhaustible. The third layer is
already joined with existence, it is rooted in existence.</p><p><br></p><p>Farid felt – when the first layer was exhausted he felt the young man
was becoming stronger. Suddenly there was a great strength; it was
difficult even for Farid to keep him down. And soon Farid became aware
that now the third layer had become available. And the young man threw
Farid as if Farid were just a toy. He came out, was very angry,
obviously, and he said, “Are you mad or something? I had asked a
religious question and you were going to kill me! Are you a murderer?
And people think that you are a great sage!”</p><p><br></p><p>Farid said, “We can discuss these things later on. Right now, lest
you forget, let me ask the question:</p><p>what happened when I went on forcing you down and down into the
water?” He said, “What happened?”</p><p>Farid asked, “Were there many thoughts in your head?” He said, “Many
thoughts? There was only one thought – how to get out!”</p><p>“Was it a thought or was it a feeling?” Farid asked.</p><p><br></p><p>And he said, “It was a feeling, you are right, it was not a thought.
I was not verbalizing it; it was not in</p><p>my head, it was in my heart. It was just a feel – now I am
verbalizing it.” “And how long did it stay?”</p><p>And the young man said, “You are again right. A moment came when that
too disappeared: there was no thought, no feeling. But something was
happening, I don’t know what, from where. I was not doing it, it was
happening – a great uprush of energy from some unknown source. Now I can
look backwards, I can formulate it, but at that very moment I was
conscious, ABSOLUTELY conscious. I have never been so conscious, because
I have never been in such danger before. I was alert, absolutely alert,
but still there was no thought, no feeling, not even a desire to save
myself. In fact there was no me. I had disappeared, but something was
happening beyond me, something transcendental.”</p><p>Farid said, “Now you know the answer – this is the way to find God.
When you are not, the transcendental descends in you. Now you can go.
Never ask anybody again, you know the key: let God become such a
problem, such a quest, as if your life is at stake.”</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what happened to Kabir. He says:</p><p><br></p><p>AB TO BEHAL KABIR BHAYO...</p><p><br></p><p>Now the moment is approaching closer and closer</p><p>when I know my death is becoming an absolute certainty. Either you or
death!</p><p><br></p><p>Now it is a question of either/or.</p><p>All other alternatives have disappeared.</p><p><br></p><p>Everything has become narrowed down to two things: death or God...
death or God.</p><p><br></p><p>AB TO BEHAL KABIR BHAYO HAI, BIN DEKHE JIV JAYE RE...</p><p><br></p><p>If you don’t appear I will be gone,</p><p>and then it will be too late for you to come.</p><p><br></p><p>And then you will repent</p><p>that one who had prayed his whole life, one who had devoted his all
to you, one who was so surrendered,</p><p><br></p><p>one who was so deep in trust,</p><p><br></p><p>died, and you didn’t appear.</p><p>The song ends at this point, because beyond this nothing can be said.
Kabir died and God appeared. The host disappeared and the Guest came in.
The Guest waits for you to die.</p><p>That is the meaning of the Christian symbol of the cross. Jesus says
to his disciples: If you want to follow me, you will have to carry your
own crosses on your own shoulders. Each one has to carry his own cross,
each one has to prepare for his own ultimate death – I don’t mean
physical death, remember. Physical death has happened to you many times;
millions of times you have died physically. That is not true death
because the mind continues, enters into another womb, starts another
game; again the whole story is repeated. You go on moving in circles;
that is not true death.</p><p>The true death is known only by the devotee who comes to a point when
he CANNOT live without God, it is impossible to live without God. When
this impossibility arises, that one cannot live without God... this is
what Jesus means, by ‘carrying your own cross’. Of course, nobody else
can carry it for you. This death is so deep that nobody can help you.
This death is so much of the interior that nobody can approach it from
the outside. You cannot be murdered, you can only commit suicide – about
THIS death, about THIS internal disappearance, about THIS subjective
annihilation, cessation.</p><p>Kabir died, Kabir disappeared... and the Guest was always there; it
was only the presence of Kabir that was preventing it.</p><p>One of the greatest poets that India has given birth to in this
century was Rabindranath Tagore. He has written a memoir of tremendous
beauty and significance.</p><p>He was staying in a boat on a river; he loved his boat and the river.
It was a full moon night. In the small cabin of his boat he was
pondering over one of the ancientmost questions that all the poets have
pondered over: what is beauty? He was looking into books, ancient and
modern; he had a great library in his cabin all about aesthetics: what
is beauty? That had been his lifelong concern – what is beauty? –
because he had the feeling that God is beauty – not truth, but
beauty.</p><p>Truth looks dry, truth looks logical. The very word connotes some
head-trip; truth seems to belong to the head. Hence Rabindranath used to
say that God is not truth but beauty. Beauty is a feel, it is not a
logical phenomenon; it is of the heart. It is closer to love than
logic.</p><p><br></p><p>This had been his lifelong meditation: what is beauty? And on that
night also he had been thinking about it, looking into books, finding
out definitions. Half the night passed. He was completely oblivious to
the full moon, he was completely oblivious to the silence outside, the
absolutely silent river and the full moon and the beauty of the full
moon. And the whole river was transformed into silver... and the silent
trees meditating on the banks, and only once in a while a distant call
of a cuckoo. But he was completely oblivious to it all.</p><p><br></p><p>Then feeling tired, exhausted, he closed the books, blew out a small
candle, and suddenly a great revelation happened. As he blew out the
small candle, from the windows, from the doors, from every side, the
moonlight entered in, started dancing in the cabin. That sudden change –
the candle was burning and the moon had not been coming in... The moment
the candle was blown out the moonlight entered in. For a moment
Rabindranath was in such awe that he says, “I knew in that moment what
beauty is. I cannot say to anybody, I cannot define it yet, but in that
moment I knew what beauty is. The utter silence, the distant call of the
cuckoo, suddenly the entering of the moonlight<span class=s5></span>”</p><p><br></p><p>He went out it was sheer beauty. The whole existence was celebrating!
The river was just silver,</p><p>the whole sky opened with just a few white clouds floating.</p><p><br></p><p>He wrote in his notebook, “How foolish I am! I was looking in the
books for the definition of beauty,</p><p>and beauty was standing at my door! And a small candle prevented the
great moon from entering!”</p><p>He wrote in his diary, “Exactly like that, in that night I felt this
small ego and its pale light preventing the Guest, God.”</p><p>Blow this candle out, blow it out! Let there be no ego, and suddenly,
from every nook and corner, the Guest enters in – and you know what
beauty is, and you know what God is.</p><p><br></p><p>That is exactly what must have happened to Kabir. He does not say in
this song. In another song somewhere he says:</p><p>There was a day when I used to go on religious pilgrimages in search
of God.</p><p>I went to Kashi, I went to Mathura, I went to this temple and to
that.</p><p><br></p><p>I went to every place, wherever I heard God is, and I never found Him
anywhere.</p><p>Then one day, Kabir disappeared.</p><p><br></p><p>Since then, God comes following me wherever I go</p><p><br></p><p>calling, “Kabir, Kabir! Where are you going?”</p><p><br></p><p>And I don’t care! He follows me like a shadow, and how can I care,
because I am no more. He goes on calling, “Kabir, Kabir!”</p><p><br></p><p>First I used to call Him and He never answered –</p><p><br></p><p>why should I answer now?</p><p><br></p><p>Tit for tat!</p><p>Meditate over these beautiful songs of Kabir. They are very precious,
more so because Kabir is not a learned man at all. He says:</p><p><br></p><p>MASI KAGAD CHHUYO NAHIN –</p><p>“I have never touched paper and ink.”</p><p><br></p><p>And that is exactly so: he could not write, he could not read. He had
no idea of the Vedas and the Koran and the Bible, but what he says
contains all the Vedas and all the Korans and all the Bibles. Not
knowing a single word of the Upanishads, his poetry contains all of
them. He is not a learned man but he is a wise man; not knowledgeable,
but he knows. And he has come the hard way.</p><p><br></p><p>I n fact there is no other way – no cheap way, no shortcut.</p><p><br></p><p>If you meditate on him, slowly, slowly a great desire, a flame of
longing in your heart, will arise, because you will also be able to see
that nothing in the world can ever satisfy you except the Guest.</p><p>Minus God you are a corpse, plus God you are a celebration.</p><p><br></p><p>CHAPTER 5</p><p><br></p><p>A play with the devil</p><p><br></p><p>3 0 A p r i l 1 9 7 9 a m i n B u d d h a H a l l</p><p><br></p><p>The first question:</p><p>YOU, THE FOUNTAIN OF LOVE, OUR SOURCE IS IN THEE.

man has lived an absolutely loveless life. All the societies and the
cultures and the religions that have existed on the earth have</p><p><br></p><p>talked about love, but lived a very loveless existence. Much talk
about love has happened in the past, but the structure that societies
have created is basically against love. The society is geared for war,
and a society that is geared for war can only talk about love but cannot
live it.</p><p><br></p><p>We have come now to the peak of this ugly, stupid structure of
hatred. We have come to the point where either man is to change totally
or will have to die.</p><p>The new man can be born only with a new heart, with a new soul – and
the flavor of that soul will be love, and the poetry of that heart will
be love. A society that lives lovelessly is competitive, ambitious,
obsessed with money, power, prestige. A society that lives without love
lives through beliefs. Beliefs divide people, and all divisions breed
war. A society that lives without love lives a very lusterless
existence, because without love there is no splendor in life, no
significance. Without love no song arises in the heart of man.</p><p>We have come to the point or we are coming to it, approaching it
every day: by the end of this century man will have to choose either
total destruction or a revolution – a revolution not political, not
social, but a revolution of the heart. A turning-point is coming closer
every day; you have to be prepared for it.</p><p><br></p><p>Sannyas has to become a herald for a new world, the first ray of the
dawn. Man is reaching towards total war; all preparations are there to
commit a global suicide. This is what your history has brought you to.
All the Alexanders and all the Napoleons and all the Stalins and all the
Hitlers and all the Maos have been working for centuries and centuries;
now their dream is going to be fulfilled: we can destroy this whole
earth within seconds. Destruction has reached its peak; unless
creativity also reaches to its peak man cannot be saved.</p><p><br></p><p>And to me, love is nothing but the birth of creativity in you. By
love I mean an overflowing heart. Love to me is not only a relationship.
The relationship that we call love is a faraway, distant echo of the
real thing.</p><p>The real thing is not a relationship but a state; one is not in love
but one IS love. Whenever I talk about love remember this: I am talking
about the state of love. Yes, relationship is perfectly good, but the
relationship is going to be false if you have not attained to the state
of love. Then the relationship is not only a pretension, it is a
dangerous pretension, because it can go on befooling you; it can go on
giving you the sense that you know what love is, and you don’t know.
Love basically is a state of being; one is not in love, one IS love.</p><p><br></p><p>And that love arises not by falling in love with somebody. That love
arises by going in – not by falling but by rising, soaring upwards,
higher than you. It is a kind of surpassing. A man is love when his
being is silent; it is the song of silence. A Buddha is love, a Jesus is
love – not in love with a particular person, but simply love. Their very
climate is love. It is not addressed to anybody in particular, it is
spreading in all directions. Whosoever comes close to a Buddha will feel
it, will be showered by it, will be bathed in it. And it is
unconditionally so.</p><p><br></p><p>Love makes no conditions, no ifs, no buts. Love never says, “Fulfill
these requirements, then I will love you.” Love is like breathing: when
it happens you are simply love. It does not matter who comes close to
you, the sinner or the saint. Whosoever comes close to you starts
feeling the vibe of love, is rejoiced. Love is unconditional giving –
but only those are capable of giving who HAVE.</p><p><br></p><p>One of the most mysterious things about man is that he goes on giving
things which he doesn’t have. You go on giving love and you don’t have
it in the first place, and you go on asking love from others who don’t
have it in the first place. Beggars begging from beggars!</p><p><br></p><p>Love first has to happen in the deepest core of your being. It is the
quality of being alone, happily alone, joyously alone. It is the quality
of being a no-mind, of being silent. Contentless consciousness is the
space, the context in which love arises in you.</p><p><br></p><p>And when it arises in you it is so much, it is unbearable. Its
pleasure is so unbearable that it becomes almost pain. It is heavy like
the clouds which are full of rain; they HAVE to shower, they HAVE to
rain, they HAVE to unburden themselves. When love arises in the silent
heart, it has to be shared, it has to be given; you are helpless.</p><p><br></p><p>And the person you give your love to is not obliged to you in any
way. In fact, you are obliged to the person because he helped you
unburden, he shared something that was too much in you. And the
economics of love is: the more you give, the more you have, because in
your silent being you are joined with the oceanic, the divine source of
all. And you can go on sharing... more and more goes on flowing in you,
it goes on welling up.</p><p>Gyan Nirmal, yes, you are right, love is the only hope of the world.
And we are coming close to that turning point: either total war or total
love. And this is a question of either/or, there is no third
alternative. There is nothing like a compromise now, you cannot be in
the middle. Man has to choose. And it is a question of life and death:
war is death, love is life.</p><p><br></p><p>By creating you here, by creating sannyasins here, I am creating a
new kind of space. This is the beginning of a totally new man. Hence the
old traditions will be unable to understand what is happening here; they
don’t have any criterion. The experiment is so new! Yes, once in a while
men like Buddha, Kabir, Krishna, Christ, Zarathustra, have happened in
the past, but only individuals. Now only individuals won’t do; only a
Buddha here and there won’t be of much help. The world has gone too much
into hate. The world is so full of hate that it is almost like an ocean
of hatred, and a Buddha will be just a spoonful of sugar – it won’t
change the taste of the ocean. We will need THOUSANDS of Buddhas.</p><p><br></p><p>Hence I am not interested in Christians, I am interested only in
Christs. I am not interested in Jains, I am interested only in Mahavirs.
I am not interested in Buddhists, I am interested only in Buddhas. My
effort here is not to create a following, not to create believers, but
to create individuals, lovers, meditators who can stand on their own,
and each one can become a light. And we will need... the night is going
to become darker and darker every day... we will need millions of lights
around the world, millions of people who are capable of love,
unconditionally, without asking anything in return, and who are so
silent and who are so blissful that wherever they are they will be able
to dissipate darkness.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes Gyan Nirmal, love is the hope of the world, the only hope. The
second question:</p><p><br></p><p>OSHO, WHILE DREAMING, SOMETHING IS CONSTANTLY TELLING ME THAT I HAVE
TO DIE. I REMEMBER NO OTHER DREAMS. WHAT IS HAPPENING?</p><p><br></p><p>Anand Sunno,</p><p>MEDITATE first over this small anecdote.…</p><p><br></p><p>The young man had been keeping company with a girl for over two
years, but still had given no indication of serious intentions.</p><p>“I had a strange dream last night,” he remarked one day. “I dreamt I
proposed to you. I wonder what that is a sign of?”</p><p><br></p><p>“It is a sign that you have got more sense asleep than awake.”</p><p><br></p><p>And that’s exactly my answer to you, Sunno: you have got more sense
asleep than awake.</p><p>In fact, the whole movement of psychoanalysis is based on this
understanding: that people are more intelligent while dreaming than
while they are awake. Why has this strange thing happened? People should
be more intelligent when they are awake rather than when they are
dreaming. There is a reason: the society has impressed your waking mind;
it has not yet been able to impress your dreaming mind. The society has
destroyed your waking mind, distorted it, polluted it, disfigured it. It
is almost unrecognizable now from what it could have been naturally. So
much has been pruned, cut, so much has been repressed, so much has been
imposed from the outside, that you don’t know what you would have been
if society had not interfered with you so much.</p><p><br></p><p>But your unconscious, your dreaming mind is still out of the grabbing
society. It will not be for long, remember! There are people who are
working to grab your unconscious mind too. Particularly in Russia they
have been experimenting for at least twenty years on how to influence
your dreaming, sleeping mind, and they HAVE succeeded. They have
succeeded enough for you to be alert, to beware.</p><p>Now in Soviet Russia they have found that a person can be taught even
while he is asleep and dreaming. Earphones are put on the person, and in
a very, very silent way, so that his sleep is not disturbed, in a
subliminal way, messages are given. He continues to sleep yet his mind
goes on receiving messages. You can teach new languages, mathematics,
history, philosophy, anything, and he will remember in the morning. In
fact, it seems to work far better than ordinary schooling, because in
ordinary schooling you have to go on repeating the same thing again and
again; when it is repeated too much, only then does it go a little
deeper. But when you are asleep the depth of your mind is available.</p><p><br></p><p>It is okay if you teach mathematics and science and history – but
politicians cannot stop there. They will teach communism, fascism – it
is bound to happen; they will teach Gandhism – it is bound to happen.
They will teach Christianity, Hinduism, Islam – it is bound to happen.
Once the politician has got the means to influence your sleeping mind he
cannot leave you alone.</p><p>At least right now you are free to dream; soon the danger is that you
will not even be free to dream. The government will go on influencing
your dreams; it will allow you only to dream certain dreams,</p><p><br></p><p>it will create dreams in you. In a communist country you cannot dream
a capitalist dream – even in a</p><p>dream you cannot have a car of your own, that won’t be allowed.</p><p><br></p><p>And if your unconscious becomes available to the politicians, man is
utterly destroyed. It should not be allowed! This is far more dangerous
than atomic bombs, because the atom and the hydrogen bomb can only
destroy your body, but these new techniques of Behaviorist psychology
can destroy you in your psychology. Right now at least you have some
privacy. Politicians are not even willing to give you that much privacy;
they want to interfere, they want to poke into your dreams. But up to
now it has not happened much; they have succeeded in experimentation,
but it has not yet been used on a wide scale.</p><p>Sunno, you say, “WHILE DREAMING, SOMETHING IS CONSTANTLY TELLING ME
THAT I HAVE TO</p><p>DIE.” That is the voice of your inner being. It has nothing to do
with your physical death, it has</p><p>something to do with your psychological death. It has something to do
with the death of the ego.</p><p><br></p><p>It happens to every meditator: the more you meditate the more your
inner voice says, “Let the ego die.” The more you meditate, the more you
become aware that a certain death is going to happen. And you know only
one kind of death, so naturally you misinterpret; you think, “I am going
to die.” You are not going to die, only the ‘I’, the ego, the
personality is going to die, is going to disappear. Your dream is giving
you a very significant message.</p><p>And you say, “I REMEMBER NO OTHER DREAMS. WHAT IS HAPPEN ING?”</p><p><br></p><p>Then this dream is not an ordinary dream, it is something
extraordinary. It is not just the rubbish of the mind. Ninety-nine
percent of your dreams consist of the rubbish, rubbish that you gather
in the day, rubbish that you go on chewing over in the night. It is the
reflection of your day, it has nothing special in it.</p><p>That’s why psychoanalysis takes so many years – to find a gem in the
rubbish takes time. The rubbish is really so much that it takes two
years, three years for the psychoanalyst to find something significant,
to sort it out, to figure out where you are, what you are.</p><p>But in meditation it can happen very quickly, because in meditation
you go directly. You don’t search in</p><p>the rubbish, you simply dive deep into your being to where the
diamond is, where the Lotus Paradise is.</p><p><br></p><p>Sunno, you are hearing something of your inner voice. It is not
really a dream, it is far more true than any truth that you have yet
known. It is the voice of your soul, it is God speaking to you. Listen,
follow – help the ego to die. Become absolutely non-existent as far as
the ego is concerned.</p><p>And in the death of the ego love is born, God is born, light is born.
In the death of the ego you are transformed; all misery disappears as if
it had never existed. Your life right now is a nightmare. When the ego
dies nightmares disappear and a great sweetness arises in your being,
and a subtle joy, for no reason at all. You cannot explain it to
anybody, you cannot explain it to yourself either. It is unexplainable,
mysterious. But who cares for the explanation? When you are bathed, when
you are in rejoicing, when the being is in a dance, who cares?</p><p><br></p><p>People ask why only when they are in suffering. You ask why when you
are ill, you never ask why when you are healthy. You never ask your
physician, “Why am I healthy?” You certainly ask when you are ill, “Why
am I ill? Why this headache, why this stomach-ache?” But when you are
perfectly healthy you don’t go to the physician to ask, “Why am I
healthy?” Health is natural, so is bliss; misery is unnatural. Misery is
pathology, illness, dis-ease.</p><p><br></p><p>Let the ego die, Sunno. The time has come, and your inner voice is
saying, “Don’t cling to it. Let go!”</p><p><br></p><p>The third question:</p><p>OSHO, IF I SHOULD MEET BHAGWAN SHREE RAJNEESH WALKING DOWN THE ROAD,
SHOULD I KILL HIM?</p><p><br></p><p>Barry Letts,</p><p><br></p><p>CERTAINLY! You know, that s why I never walk down the road!</p><p><br></p><p>But you don’t understand; you have asked the question, but you don’t
understand the meaning of it at all. This is a message only for the
disciples, and you are not yet a disciple, you are not yet a
sannyasin.</p><p>This is a Zen way of saying something of immense value. It is a Zen
saying: If you meet the Buddha on the Way, kill him! But Buddha is dead,
has been dead for twenty-five centuries. Where can you meet him, on what
way? And how can you... can you kill one who has been dead for
twenty-five centuries?</p><p><br></p><p>It has a totally different meaning: it is a message to the disciple
who LOVES Buddha, who loves Buddha so much that there is a possibility
that Buddha may become his last barrier – because of his love, because
he is a disciple, because he is a sannyasin, because he meditates, goes
deeper and deeper into his being and will feel more and more grateful
towards Buddha.</p><p>And at the last moment even the Master has to be left behind... at
the last moment. At the very last you have to say goodbye to the Master
too. This is something inner, remember; it has nothing to do with the
outer. This is something inner. All thoughts disappear, then only one
thought remains – the thought of your Master.</p><p>And it is very difficult to say goodbye. You owe so much to the
Master – he has been your source, your transformation; he has been your
nourishment, your life; he has brought you along the long way. And now
to say goodbye to the person who has been your guide, your friend? And
now to say goodbye to him who has been a constant companion in the dark
night of the soul; when the dawn is coming to say goodbye to him? It
seems impossible! And the disciple, at the last moment, starts clinging
to the idea of the Master.</p><p><br></p><p>But that becomes a barrier. The Master will himself give him a push,
and if you don’t listen to the push</p><p>then he will give you a kick in the pants! – because you have to go,
you have to go into the unknown.</p><p><br></p><p>The Master himself says – I say to you – “If you meet me on the Way,
kill me.” But what way is implied? You will not meet me on M.G. Road!
What way? If you go inwards, on the inner Way, on the inward journey, at
the last check-post I am waiting for you.</p><p><br></p><p>And it will be difficult to say goodbye, it has always been difficult
to say goodbye. Hence the statement to just KILL the Master, so there is
no need even to say goodbye; kill the Master so there is no need to look
back; kill the Master so you can now be left TOTALLY alone, with not
even the shadow of the Master with you. And this is done in great
gratefulness, in great gratitude.</p><p><br></p><p>But Barry Letts, this is not for you. First become a sannyasin, a
disciple, start moving inwards; only then can you meet me. You have not
yet even met me outwardly, how can you meet me inwardly? You have not
yet come closer to me, how can you be in a state of clinging to me? You
are far away, you are distant, you are avoiding. You have not even said
good morning so what is the point of saying goodbye?</p><p>First become a disciple. Move on the inward Way, let me help you to
the ultimate point, and then certainly if you meet me on the inner Way,
kill me.</p><p>But it happens that people understand only according to THEIR idea.
You have not understood this Zen koan. And remember again, it is not
that the disciple kills the Master in anger. He kills him in gratitude.
In fact he kills him because the Master orders him to kill him; he
simply followed the commandment – crying, weeping, with tears in his
eyes. And even when he has killed, the gratitude remains.</p><p>You know the story of the famous Zen Master, Ikkyu? He was staying in
a temple on a very cold night. There were many wooden Buddhas in the
temple, so he brought two, three Buddhas and made a good fire, and
enjoyed.</p><p><br></p><p>In the middle of the night, with the fire and the crackling of the
wood and the smoke, the priest awoke: “What is happening? What is going
on?” He saw this monk who was a stranger, who had asked for shelter and
was given shelter, and what had he done? Three Buddhas gone! Naturally
he was in a rage. He said, “Are you mad or something? You have burnt
three Buddhas!”</p><p><br></p><p>Ikkyu took his staff and started searching. Now there was nothing
left, just ashes; he was searching for something in the ashes. And the
priest asked, “What are you searching for?”</p><p>He said, “For Buddha’s bones.”</p><p><br></p><p>In India, in the East, the bones are called flowers, symbolically. So
he said, “I am searching for the flowers, for the bones of Buddha.”</p><p>Now it was the priest’s turn to laugh. He said, “You are really mad!
How can you find flowers, bones, in</p><p>the wooden Buddhas?”</p><p><br></p><p>Ikkyu said, “Then you too are not as stupid as you look. Then bring a
few more Buddhas, because the night is long and it is too cold. If you
know that these are only wooden Buddhas, then what is the fear? We can
enjoy! My Buddha inside is feeling cold. And what do you think – should
I care about the living Buddha or the wooden Buddha?”</p><p><br></p><p>It was too dangerous to keep this man inside the temple, and the
priest had to go to sleep too, so he said, “You please get out,
otherwise you may burn other Buddhas. You simply get out! I don’t want
anything of this nonsense!”</p><p><br></p><p>He threw him out into the cold night. When he was being thrown out
Ikkyu again said, “What are you doing? Throwing a Buddha, a living
Buddha, out on such a cold night to protect the wooden Buddhas?”</p><p><br></p><p>But the priest wouldn’t listen, he closed the doors in his face. And
in the morning when the priest went out of the temple he saw another
miracle happening. Just by the side of the road there was a milestone.
Ikkyu had gathered a few flowers from the roadside. He had offered the
flowers to the milestone, was bowing down and was saying, “BUDDHAM
SHARANAM GACHCHHAMI, SANGHAM SHARANAM GACHCHHAMI, DHAMMAM SHARANAM
GACHCHHAMI :” I take shelter at the feet of the Buddha, I take shelter
in your commune, my Lord, I take shelter in the DHAMMA, the Law that you
have taught to us.”</p><p>The priest said, “What are you doing? In the night you burnt a
Buddha, and now you are worshipping</p><p>the milestone as a Buddha?”</p><p><br></p><p>And Ikkyu said, “If you have gratitude you can show it anywhere. If
you don’t have it even thousands of</p><p>wooden Buddhas cannot create it.” If you have gratitude you can show
it anywhere<span class=s5></span>Now this is the</p><p>man of Zen.</p><p><br></p><p>Barry Letts, if you understand Ikkyu then you will understand this
statement. On the one hand he burned, on the other hand he
worshipped.</p><p>The Masters who were telling their disciples, “If you meet the Buddha
on the Way, kill him!” were worshipping the Buddha every day, morning,
afternoon, evening. They were prostrating themselves before the Buddha.
And many times it had been asked by the disciples, “Sir, you say ‘If you
meet the Buddha on the Way, kill him!’ Then why do you worship?”</p><p><br></p><p>And he would say, “Because he is the only Master in the world Buddha
is the only Master in the</p><p>world who helps you to get rid of him too; hence the gratitude.”</p><p><br></p><p>You have not understood the statement. These statements have a very
different meaning than is apparent. To understand these statements you
will have to become a little grown-up. As far as these statements are
concerned, you are like children.</p><p><br></p><p>A teacher explained to her class that the four basic elements of
successful fiction were religion, royalty, sex and mystery. Then she
assigned her class to write their first novel. After about five minutes
little Peter walked up to the teacher’s desk and said, “Teacher, I have
finished.”</p><p>“In five minutes?” asked the teacher. “Are you sure you included the
four basic elements, religion,</p><p>royalty, sex, and mystery?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, I did,” said the boy. “I will read it to you:‘Holy Moses!’ said
the princess, ‘Pregnant again? wonder who done it this time<span class=s5></span>“’</p><p><br></p><p>The novel was finished, and all the four basic elements were there:
“HOLY Moses!” said the</p><p>PRINCESS. “PREGNANT again? I WONDER who done it this time<span class=s5></span>”</p><p><br></p><p>To understand these great statements you will need a little more
grown-up mind.</p><p>Yes certainly, Barry Letts, if you meet me on the Way, kill me. But
first please, be on the Way –</p><p>where I am waiting for you, to be killed by you!</p><p><br></p><p>But you don’t know another thing which is not really ever said. This
statement is only half of it; the other half, the first half, is
missing. Before you can ever kill me, I will kill you. That’s how you
will enter the Way!</p><p>The fourth question:</p><p><br></p><p>OSHO, MY WISE SHIATSU TEACHER AT HOME TOLD US, “YOU CANNOT FIGHT
AGAINST THE DEVIL, YOU CAN ONLY PLAY WITH HIM.” I FEEL THAT THIS COULD
HELP ME BUT I DO NOT UNDERSTAND IT COMPLETELY. WOULD YOU SPEAK ABOUT
IT?</p><p><br></p><p>Christiane,</p><p><br></p><p>IT IS a beautiful statement and of great significance. You cannot
fight against the devil, because if you fight with the devil you take
the devil very seriously, and to take the devil very seriously is to
believe in him. The devil is created by your seriousness about him, your
seriousness is his nourishment. It is by your being serious about him
that you pay respects, that you feed him. And the more serious you
become about him, the more frightened you are; the more frightened you
are the more he will scare you. The devil has not to be taken seriously
at all, and if you fight you cannot avoid taking him seriously.</p><p>And how are you going to fight with the devil? Where will you find
him? You will find him within yourself – you will condemn some part of
your being as the devil and you will fight with it. And that is like
your right hand fighting with your left hand, condemning, condemning the
left as the devil. And that’s how people think: right is right and left
is wrong.</p><p><br></p><p>The left hand is as much you as your right hand. You will divide
yourself: your head will start fighting with your heart, your mind will
start fighting with your body. You will become fragmentary, you will
become divided, and there will be a great civil war within you. You will
condemn sex, you will condemn anger, greed, and you will condemn a
thousand and one things, but they are part of you. The more you condemn
them the more power you give to them, because whenever you condemn
something you become focused on it – and to be attentive to something is
to give power to it. Whenever you become too attentive towards something
you become hypnotized by it.</p><p>The person who is against sex becomes obsessed with it. He
CONTINUOUSLY thinks about it because he has to be alert, on guard;
otherwise the enemy will defeat him. And for twenty-four hours on guard
against whom? – against your own energy! So you are split; and to be
split is to be in misery, and to be split is to be poor because the
energy dissipates. And to be in inner conflict is to be in anguish,
agony. Bliss means to be integrated.</p><p><br></p><p>Where is the devil? It is some condemned part of you. And you cannot
cut it out because it is so deeply a part of you that there is no
possibility of separating it from your self. So you can go on fighting,
but you will never win.</p><p><br></p><p>The statement is beautiful: you cannot fight against the devil, you
can only play with him.</p><p><br></p><p>And that’s what I am teaching you here: be playful, non-serious. Yes,
even with sex, anger, greed, everything that has been condemned down the
ages, be playful with it. And then the miracle happens: if you are
playful the devil starts evaporating, because it is seriousness that
gives him shape and form and solidity. When you become playful about
him, when you are not on guard, when you are not fighting, he is being
starved; and when you are playful you take the very earth from
underneath his feet.</p><p><br></p><p>Try to be playful with anything and you will see the miracle
happening. Be playful with sex and soon you will be beyond sex. That’s
the whole secret of Tantra: just be playful about it, don’t take it so
seriously, it is nothing to be worried about. It is not a problem to be
solved, it is your energy to be understood – and not only understood but
re-absorbed.</p><p><br></p><p>If you can absorb your own sexual energy you will be far richer than
you are, stronger than you are. If you can absorb your anger into
yourself, your greed into yourself, you will no longer be a
schizophrenic; your whole pathology will disappear. You will be whole
and healthy, and you will have a totally different feeling of
well-being. You will be surrounded by sunlight. You will be sunlit! And
wherever you go you will carry peace – very tangible, very substantial –
around you, because there will be no conflict in you.</p><p><br></p><p>Being playful is one of the great secrets of inner
transformation.</p><p>Christiane, learn to be playful. If all seriousness disappears from
your life, you are religious.</p><p><br></p><p>But this is not what is ordinarily understood by a religious person.
A religious person becomes very, very serious. He looks at you as if you
are sinners condemned to go to hell, doomed. He walks erect, with great
pride. You can see in his eyes that he knows that he is ‘holier than
thou’, higher than thou, that he is saved and you are condemned. And of
course he becomes very serious; his going to the church, to the temple,
his prayer, his ritual, all are very serious affairs. He does not take
it non-seriously, playfully. And you cannot know what prayer is if you
don’t know what playfulness is.</p><p><br></p><p>Real religion teaches you playfulness – sincerity of course, but
seriousness no, authenticity of course, but seriousness no.</p><p>You have come to the right place, Christiane, that’s what we are
doing here. This whole space that is being created here is that of
playfulness. People are working, but the work has no seriousness about
it, no tension about it. They are enjoying it; that is prayer, that is
worship. They are continuously working – nowhere else can you find so
much work going on, and with such non-seriousness, with such
playfulness.</p><p><br></p><p>Just a few days ago I told you that there are three hundred people
working. It was wrong – about information I am not very reliable, even
about my own ashram, because I never go out I am afraid... somebody may
kill me, because fools are everywhere!</p><p><br></p><p>It is perfectly okay with Buddha if you kill him, because he is
already dead!</p><p><br></p><p>Laxmi told me that there are not three hundred, but seven hundred
people working, and one hundred are waiting because there is no space
for them to work. How can there be space in such a small, six- acre
piece of land? Seven hundred people working – per acre there are more
than a hundred! But you don’t feel crowded... because there are no
serious people around. Otherwise one serious person is enough to make
the place crowded. A hundred playful persons don’t make a crowd; they
remain individuals, they don’t create a crowd. And you can see the joy
and the celebrating mood.</p><p><br></p><p>This I call true religion – playfulness, lovingness, cheerfulness.
The fifth question:</p><p>OSHO, HOW LONG DOES THIS STUPID SEX CONTINUE TO HAUNT ONE? I AM
GETTING ON SIXTY AND IT IS STILL THERE.</p><p>Sukh Deva,</p><p><br></p><p>SEX has nothing to do with age; you can be six hundred and it will
still be there. It has something to do with awareness, not with age.
Remember, just by growing old you don’t grow up. You may be sixty
physiologically, and you may be just nearabout twelve, thirteen, or at
the most fourteen psychologically, hence this hang-up. A person who is
psychologically fourteen is bound to be haunted by sex, and people are
stuck at somewhere near thirteen, fourteen.</p><p>The average mental age of humanity is twelve. It is unbelievable that
people get stuck so early. What happens, and why at just nearabout
twelve, thirteen, fourteen? – because that is the time when sex ripens
in you, and no society wants you to go beyond that point. Every society
wants you to remain sexually starved, because a sexually starved person
is very useful for the society – for this ill society. A sexually
starved person can be channelized in any direction very easily because
he is boiling within. You can make him go after money: then money will
be his sex, then his whole sexual energy which is starved will move
towards money. Then money will be his beloved, his God, and for his
whole life he will run after money. And naturally, sex will haunt him
because money cannot satisfy it. You can gather as much money as you
want, but how can it satisfy your basic urge? The society has diverted
your urge, has given you a diversion; it has given you a toy.</p><p><br></p><p>And that’s how we start from the very beginning: the child is crying,
he wants milk, and he is given a pacifier! And the poor child starts
sucking the pacifier and thinks that it is the mother’s breast. How mean
can we be? This is sheer meanness! You are being very political with the
poor child, diplomatic, cunning. The poor child has no understanding yet
to make a distinction between the pacifier and the breast; he has been
deceived. Now if later on this child one day disrespects his mother,
hates his mother, there is no wonder in it.</p><p><br></p><p>You can go to any psychoanalyst and ask him, “What is the fundamental
problem of every person?” and you will be surprised to know that he will
not give you some name: neurosis, psychosis, schizophrenia, hysteria, et
cetera, et cetera. If you ask him, “What is the fundamental problem
of</p><p><br></p><p>every psychologically disturbed person?” he will say, “the mother.”
But why the mother? – because she was the first one who started
deceiving the child. She was the first acquaintance of the child with
the world, and he cannot trust anybody now. He cannot even trust his own
mother, how can he trust anybody else? And when the child was crying and
he wanted to be hugged... because a child needs warmth as much as milk,
it is a very deep physiological need of the child.</p><p><br></p><p>Now it is a proven scientific fact that if a child is given all
nourishment but no warmth of the body, he will shrink and die. Or even
if he survives he will remain retarded, unhealthy for his whole life;
something will be missing in him. He not only needs mother’s milk, he
needs the warmth of the mother’s bosom, the warmth of the mother’s body.
That warmth is now understood to be absolutely fundamental, absolutely
necessary.</p><p>But when the child is crying he cannot say, “Mum, I want to be
hugged,” because he has no language yet. But by crying he is saying,
“Hug me, kiss me, caress me, let me come close to you.” And he is given
a teddy bear, or he is given some toy to be engaged with. He is being
deceived from the very beginning: he wants something, he gets something
else. That’s how we go on distorting.</p><p><br></p><p>By the time a child is coming to sexual maturity we start giving him
ambitions. We start telling him, “Come first in the university, come
first in school – come first! Wherever you are, whatsoever you are
doing, you have to be the first.” We start a great desire in his mind to
be first anywhere he is; this is giving a new direction to his sexual
energy.</p><p><br></p><p>The society is trying to divert his natural energies. We start
telling him, “Unless you have a big car, a big house, much money in the
bank, you are a failure.” He starts running after big things. He may not
need a big house. In fact a smaller house may be far more beautiful
because it can be kept more clean, and his needs are not that much that
he should have a big house of many, many rooms. But the idea has been
implanted in his mind that “Unless you have a big house, very imposing,
you are a failure.” Now the big house becomes his symbol of fulfillment,
money in the bank becomes his symbol of fulfillment</p><p>– but only symbols, empty. Deep down he is unfulfilled, deep down he
is hankering. The deep consciousness is continuously telling him, “Be
natural, let your natural energies flow in a natural, spontaneous
way.”</p><p>You ask me, Sukh Deva, “HOW LONG DOES THIS STUPID SEX CONTINUE TO
HAUNT ONE?”</p><p><br></p><p>Why do you call it stupid? You are angry at it. Sex is not stupid –
you may be stupid! Sex is simply sex. You can be stupid with it, you can
be intelligent with it; that is something about you, not about sex. And
if you call it names, if you condemn, it will persist. You will be
sixty, you will be seventy, you will be eighty – it won’t make any
difference. In fact, the more weak your body will become, the more the
repressed sex will explode on your conscious-</p><p>The big burly rapist broke into a Texas homestead when all the men
were out on a cattle drive and raped all ten women living there – all
except an eighty-five-year-old great granma.</p><p><br></p><p>The victims lay around groaning in a state of chaos. The rapist lay
in the corner exhausted and naked.</p><p>Old granny took her spectacles off her nose, put them on the nose of
the rapist and cried, “Look around, big fella, and see if you missed
anybody!”</p><p><br></p><p>Sukh Deva, it will persist; don’t call it stupid. You are being
stupid with it.</p><p><br></p><p>Accept it. It is a natural desire, a natural energy, the very
fountain-source of all life. Yes, there are things beyond it, beautiful
spaces beyond it. Sex brings joy and sex brings misery too. They are
mixed with sex because sex is a mixture of the sky and the earth, body
and soul; hence it brings both – it gives you wings one moment, it cuts
your wings another moment. One moment it is a great ecstasy, another
moment you have fallen into a deep agony. One moment you are on the
peak, the sunlit peak, another moment you are groaning in a dark valley.
Sex is both.</p><p><br></p><p>But one has to learn the valleys and the peaks. And one has to learn
by one’s own experience, not by what others say, not by what I say. Your
own experience of sex will make you free of it. I am not saying be free
of it; and don’t try to be free of it, otherwise you will never be free
of it.</p><p><br></p><p>What I am saying is simply: freedom from sex is a consequence, a
by-product. You cannot achieve it directly, it comes indirectly. You
live it with deep playfulness, meditativeness, as a gift of God, and
slowly slowly, seeing the peaks and the valleys again and again, a third
point will arise in your being: the witness who witnesses the peak, who
witnesses the valley. Slowly, slowly neither peaks are important nor
valleys are important. Your consciousness has gone through a revolution,
you have become more centered in the witnessing soul. That witnessing is
BRAHMACHARYA, that witnessing brings real celibacy. It is not against
sex, it is beyond sex.</p><p>Otherwise, it will go on haunting you to the very last moment. You
will be dying and you will not be thinking of God, you will be thinking
of sex. That’s why the moment you die, immediately you are born – not
even minutes are lost, because you die with the idea of sex in your
head. Here you immediately leave this body, and the desire to’ enter
into another body arises, because sex can be fulfilled r only through
the body.</p><p>Down in sunny Mexico there lived an old aunt with four very pretty
nieces.</p><p><br></p><p>One day Pancho Villa and his gang of revolutionary bandits broke into
their house. Accosting them</p><p>on the patio the brigand said, “This place is in our possession and
you are in our power.”</p><p>“We are helpless!” one of the girls exclaimed, “and we must submit,
but please spare poor old aunt.” “Shut up!” snapped the aunt, “War is
war!”</p><p><br></p><p>It has nothing to do with age, it-has something to do with gaining a
higher awareness, a deeper awareness.</p><p>Become a witness, Sukh Deva, and don’t call it stupid. Become
intelligent, see, watch, observe. Whatsoever is given to you must have a
reason, a rhyme in it. Whatsoever you have got must have something of
the beyond in it. You are only able to see the lower part of the ladder
because your eyes are not open and your being is not conscious; hence
you see only the lower part of the ladder, sex. The higher part of the
ladder is SAMADHI. If you can see the whole ladder, all the rungs of it,
you will be surprised: that sex is the door to SAMADHI.</p><p><br></p><p>The very idea of SAMADHI was born because of those few rare people
who were able to attain to total orgasmic joy through sex. They became
aware that there is something in sex which is not</p><p><br></p><p>sexual at all. In a deep orgasmic state time disappears, mind
disappears, ego disappears. Now these things have nothing to do with
sex. And because these three things disappear, great joy arises. That
arising of joy has nothing to do with sex either: it is because sex
helped, became a context for the disappearance of the ego, mind and
time.</p><p><br></p><p>The first experimenters – their names are lost, it must have been
thousands of years before – the first tantrikas, the first people who
attained to SAMADHI through sex, they watched, meditated, and they saw
one thing: sex is only a physiological triggering of a certain process
which can be triggered without sex too, which can be triggered only by
meditation. There is no need to go into sex. Once they had known that
the process could be triggered by other means also – by Yoga methods, by
Tao methods, by Tantra methods, by Sufi methods – once they knew that
the same state could be attained, of no ego, no mind, no time, without
going into sex, they had found the key. But the key was found only
through groping in sex.</p><p><br></p><p>Sex has been the very source of religion, and the sexual experience
has been the first experience of SAMADHI. Don’t call it stupid, please.
Go into it lovingly, playfully, meditatively. Try to understand, because
liberation comes through understanding and in no other way.</p><p><br></p><p>The sixth question:</p><p>OSHO, SHOULD ONE NOT LISTEN TO AND FOLLOW THE WISE ADVICE OF ONE’S
PARENTS,</p><p>TEACHERS AND WELL-WISHERS?</p><p><br></p><p>Prem Deva,</p><p><br></p><p>LISTEN, but don’t follow. Listen well, but follow your own insight,
don’t follow others’ advice. Listen certainly, very meditatively, try to
understand what they are wanting to convey to you. They may REALLY be
well-wishers, but if you start following blindly you will never attain
to your own intelligence. You will remain dependent on crutches, you
will always look up to others to tell you what to do, what not to do.
You will always need leaders – which is a very unhealthy state, to need
leaders.</p><p>Listen, because people have great experiences, and if they are
sharing, willing to share, it will be foolish on your part not to
listen. Sharing their experience may give you great insight – it will
help you to become more aware – but don’t follow.</p><p><br></p><p>People follow literally and then they become just blind. When others
are giving you all that you need, what is the need to have your own
eyes? And when others are chewing for you, what is the need to chew on
your own? Slowly, slowly you become more and more weak, more and more
impoverished, more and more starved.</p><p>A man who had recently opened a shop had a large notice overhead
which read FRESH FISH SOLD HERE. Along came a friend and said, “Why have
you got ‘HERE’ on the board?” So he cut out the word ‘HERE’. Then
another friend came along and said, “‘SOLD’? Of course it is sold. You
are not giving it away, are you?” So out came the word ‘SOLD’.</p><p><br></p><p>A third came along and said, “‘FRESH FISH’? It has to be fresh. Who
will buy stale fish from you?</p><p>Cut out the word FRESH.</p><p><br></p><p>The shopkeeper obliged. Now only the word ‘FISH’ remained on the
board when a fourth man arrived and said, “‘FISH’? Fancy having that up!
You can smell it a mile away.” The shopkeeper erased this last word on
the board.</p><p>A fifth man arrived and said, “What’s the idea of hanging a blank
board over the shop?” The</p><p>shopkeeper removed the board.</p><p>A sixth man came on the scene and said, “You have opened such a big
shop. Can’t you hang a</p><p>board on it with a notice saying, ‘FRESH FISH SOLD HERE?’”</p><p><br></p><p>Now if you go on listening to people you will become more and more
confused; that’s how you have become confused. Your confusion is this:
that you have been listening to many kinds of people and they are all
giving different advice. And I am not saying that they are not
well-wishers; they are well- wishers, but not very conscious
well-wishers, otherwise they would not give you advice. They would give
you an insight, not advice. They would not tell you what to do and what
not to do. They would help you to become more aware so that you can see
yourself what has to be done and what has not to be done.</p><p>The real friend is one who does not advise you, but helps you to
become more alert, more aware, more conscious of life – its problems,
its challenges, its mysteries, and helps you to go on your own voyage,
gives you courage to experiment, gives you courage to seek and search,
gives you courage to commit many mistakes... because one who is not
ready to commit mistakes will never learn anything at all.</p><p>Commit as many mistakes as you can, but don’t commit the same mistake
twice because that makes you stupid. Commit new mistakes, invent new
mistakes, and you will be learning all the time, and your intelligence
will be growing all the time. Your intelligence needs sharpening.</p><p><br></p><p>The real friends help you to sharpen your intelligence. They don’t
give you fixed advice, because fixed advice is of no use. What is true
today may not be true tomorrow, and what is right in one situation may
be wrong in another. And situations are changing all the time, so what
you need is not a fixed pattern of living but a way of seeing, so
wherever you are, in whatsoever situation you find yourself, you know
how to behave spontaneously, how to depend on your own being.</p><p><br></p><p>The seventh question:</p><p>OSHO, I SIMPLY CAN’T BELIEVE IN GOD. WHAT SHOULD I DO?</p><p><br></p><p>Krishna Kant,</p><p><br></p><p>I HAVE not been telling you to believe in God. Why should you be
worried about it? If you can’t believe, you can’t believe – forget all
about it! Now it is God’s problem that Krishna Kant does not</p><p><br></p><p>believe in Him; if He is anxious, worried, He will take care. But why
are you worried? Deep down somewhere you must be wanting to believe,
otherwise why the question at all? I am not telling you to believe in
God; there is no need.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha attained to the ultimate without believing in God, why can’t
you? Mahavir attained to truth, to enlightenment, without believing in
any God, why can’t you?</p><p>In that sense Eastern religions are far more rich than the Western
religions. Judaism, Christianity, Islam, all the three religions that
were born outside of India, are in that way a little poor,
unsophisticated, crude. Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, the three religions
that were born in India, have a tremendous sophistication about them.
They don’t make such unnecessary demands on you.</p><p>Buddhism is the ultimate in sophistication. Buddha says there is no
need to believe in God, there is no need even to believe in the soul.
There is no need to believe at all. Belief is not a necessity in being
religious. Then what is necessary? Meditation is necessary, not belief.
And one can meditate without belief because meditation is a scientific
method.</p><p><br></p><p>It happens many times: an atheist comes to me and he asks, “Can I
also meditate?” – because the idea has become prevalent that unless you
believe in God you cannot meditate. Now that is a very foolish notion.
Meditation has nothing to do with God. In fact the truth is that if you
believe in God, it will be difficult to meditate. Your very belief will
become a disturbance.</p><p><br></p><p>The person who does not believe in anything can simply move beyond
thoughts; the person who believes clings to thinking, because his belief
is a thought. Belief is part of the mind! If you believe too much in God
you cannot leave the mind, because leaving the mind will mean,
obviously, leaving your belief The man who cannot believe is in a better
situation.</p><p><br></p><p>Krishna Kant, you should be happy that you cannot believe in God. So
far, so good! Now meditate.</p><p><br></p><p>And remember, the English word ‘meditate’ gives a wrong connotation.
In English there is no word really which can translate the word DHYANA.
From DHYANA the word arose in China, CH’AN, and that CH’AN moved to
Japan and became Zen, but the root is DHYANA.</p><p><br></p><p>When we use the word ‘meditation’ it gives a feeling that you are
meditating UPON something. To meditate means... on what? You have to
have some object. And that is the problem. DHYANA simply means it is not
a question of focusing, concentrating on something; rather, it is
dropping all contents of the mind and just being. Meditation in the
sense of DHYANA needs no object; it is an objectless, contentless state
of consciousness. You go on dropping – NETI, NETI, neither this nor
that– you go on rejecting all thoughts, good and bad. When all thoughts
are eliminated what is left? – that is you, and that is God.</p><p>But what you call it does not matter. You can call it God if the word
appeals to you; if it doesn’t appeal to you you can call it NIRVANA, YOU
can call it Tao, or whatever. But don’t be worried about it, that you
can’t believe in God. It is good. This is my approach: if somebody says,
“I believe in God,” I say, “It is good. Now let us start from there,
that will do.” If somebody says, “I don’t believe in God,” I say, “It is
good. Now let us start from there.”</p><p><br></p><p>You have to start from the point where you are. And all points are
good, because all points are on the circumference and from every point
on the circumference the center is available. So move towards the
center, don’t be worried about where you are.</p><p><br></p><p>One afternoon Mulla Nasrudin was getting a haircut in a barber’s
shop. He noticed a price list on the wall of the shop and on the list
was, “SINGE – Rs 5”. He asked the barber why it cost so much.</p><p>“Every hair on your head,” said the barber, “is a little hollow tube,
open at the ends, so the body’s energy sort of bleeds out of it. After
you get a haircut it is a good idea to get a singe because it closes up
the hole at the end of each hair and seals in the energy. Otherwise the
hair and your whole body just keep getting weaker and weaker every time
you get it cut.”</p><p>“Now, wait a minute,” said the Mulla, “what about the hair on my
chin? I shave it every day and cut off</p><p>the ends and it just keeps getting thicker and stronger. How do you
explain that?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Easy!” said the barber. “You just ain’t the kind of a fella this
story was made up to tell to!” These are all just stories. If it
appeals, good, if it doesn’t appeal, very good!</p><p><br></p><p>Krishna Kant, forget about God. There is no need to believe; you need
not do anything about it. Don’t waste your time with God. Just because
of this word so many people go on wasting time. Somebody is trying to
prove, somebody is trying to disprove, great treatises are being
written. As many books are written about God as about anything else –
millions of books, libraries are full. Don’t be wasting your time. If
you can’t believe then that story is not for you. But we have other
stories too, so why be worried? For Godless people too there is a
way.</p><p><br></p><p>And my way is for all. Whosoever comes is accepted. The Hindu, the
Mohammedan, the Christian, the Jain, the Sikh, the Buddhist, the Parsee
– whosoever comes is accepted. I love all kinds of stories!</p><p>Any kind of beginning is good, but begin. Don’t remain stuck where
you are, move towards the center. Meditate, and that will bring you
home. And then you can call it whatsoever you like; that is none of my
business what you call it. You can give it any name of your own
fancy.</p><p><br></p><p>The last question:</p><p>OSHO, SHOULD CHILDREN BE TOLD ALL THE FACTS OF LIFE, IRRESPECTIVE OF
THEIR AGE?</p><p><br></p><p>Govinddas,</p><p>IT HAS always been a problem down the ages – what to tell children
and what not to tell. Parents have been very much concerned. In the past
the strategy was not to tell about the facts of life, to avoid it as far
as possible, because people were very much afraid about the facts of
life.</p><p><br></p><p>The very phrase ‘facts of life’ is a euphemism; it simply hides a
simple thing. Not to say anything about sex, even to avoid the word
‘sex’ they have made this metaphor, ‘facts of life’. What facts of life?
– it is just not to say anything about sex.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole past of humanity has lived with that deception, but the
children discover sooner or later. And in fact they discover sooner than
later, and they discover in a very wrong way. Because no right person is
ready to tell them, they have to do their work on their own. They
collect, they become peeping Toms – and you are responsible for reducing
them to peeping Toms. They collect from all wrong sources, from ugly
people. They will carry those wrong notions their whole lives, and you
are the cause of it. Their whole sex life may be affected by that wrong
information that they have gathered.</p><p>Now there is as much wrong information prevalent in the world about
sex as is possible. Even in this twentieth century people are living
with immense ignorance about sex, even people who you would think should
know better. Even your doctor does not really know what sex is, does not
know its complexity. He should know, but even doctors live very
superstitiously; they also know things from the marketplace. In no
medical college is sex taught as a separate subject – such an immense,
powerful subject and yet nothing is taught about it. Yes, the physiology
of sex is known by the physician, but the physiology is not all; there
are deeper layers: there is psychology, there is spirituality. There is
a psychology to sex and there is a spirituality to sex; the physiology
is only the surface. Much research has been done there, and in this
century we know more than ever before, but the knowledge is not becoming
prevalent.</p><p><br></p><p>People are afraid, because their parents were afraid and that fear
has become infectious. And you are afraid, Govinddas, and you don’t want
to tell your children about it.</p><p>You have to tell your children about it, you owe it to them. And you
have to be truthful. Don’t shirk</p><p>from truth – in the long run truth always pays – and don’t lie. “Mom,
do we get our food from God?”</p><p>“Yes, we do, Barbara.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And at Christmas time does Santa bring all our presents?” “That’s
right.”</p><p>“And on my birthday the good fairy brings presents?” “Hmm...”</p><p>“And did the stork bring little brother?” “True.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then what the heck does Pop hang around here for?”</p><p><br></p><p>It is better to be truthful! But I am not saying to jump upon your
children and start being truthful whether they want it or not. Now that
is happening – the other extreme – particularly in the West, because the
psychologists go on saying that the truth has to be told. People go on
telling the truth whether the children are enquiring about it or not.
That too is wrong. Wait! If the child enquires, be truthful; if he does
not enquire there is no need, he is not interested yet.</p><p><br></p><p>At the dinner table the old man almost choked when his little
eight-year-old boy asked, “Daddy, where do I come from?”</p><p>Reddening, Pop said, “Well, I guess the time has come for you and I
to have a man-to-man talk. After dinner I will tell you about the birds
and the bees.”</p><p>The kid said, “What birds and bees? Little Frankie down the block
told me he came from Chicago. All I</p><p>want to know is where I come from!”</p><p><br></p><p>So wait a little. They themselves will ask, you are not to be in such
a hurry. And remember, whatsoever is the case, be truthful, howsoever
hard it seems to you. It will be hard for you because truth was not told
to you by your parents; for centuries it has not been told. Everybody
gathers it from rumors, nobody ever tells it to his own children. People
feel embarrassed, afraid that the children may discover.</p><p>Drop all these fears, and don’t try in any way to deceive the
children. It can be dangerous.</p><p><br></p><p>The six-year-old Luigino comes back from school where he has learned
three new words without knowing their meaning, so he asks his mother,
“Mom, what do prick, puss and balls mean?”</p><p><br></p><p>The mother, extremely embarrassed, answers, “Well, dear, prick means
cheese, puss means chair, and balls mean boots.”</p><p>After a few days the grandmother, a pious, prudish country lady,
visits her daughter and nephew. She rings the bell and Luigino opens the
door. The old woman hugs the child and Luigino, proud of his new
vocabulary, says, “Granny, you must be tired. Sit down on this puss.”
The woman almost faints, but Luigino goes on without hesitating. “And if
you are hungry eat this piece of prick.”</p><p><br></p><p>Shocked and horrified the grandmother finally asks, “Luigino, where
is your mum?” “Ah, she is in the room polishing daddy’s balls!”</p><p><br></p><p>CHAPTER 6</p><p><br></p><p>I am a l iving l ight</p><p><br></p><p>1 M a y 1 9 7 9 a m i n B u d d h a H a l l</p><p><br></p><p>The first question:</p><p>OSHO, WHAT IS FEAR MADE OF? IT IS ALWAYS THERE BEHIND A CORNER, BUT
WHEN I TURN TO FACE IT, IT IS ONLY A SHADOW. IF IT IS NON-SUBSTANTIAL,
HOW DOES IT MANAGE TO HAVE SUCH A POWER OVER ME?</p><p><br></p><p>Anand Hamid,</p><p>FEAR is as non-substantial as your shadow, but it is. The shadow also
exists – non-substantial, negative, but not non-existential – and
sometimes the shadow can have a great impact on you. In a jungle when
the night is approaching you can be frightened of your own shadow. In a
lonely place, on a lonely path, you can start running because of your
own shadow. Your running will be real, your escaping will be real, but
the cause will be non-substantial.</p><p>You can run away from a rope thinking that it is a snake; if you come
back and you look closely and you observe, you will laugh at the whole
stupidity of it.</p><p>But people are afraid to come to places where fear exists. People are
more afraid of fear than of anything else, because the very existence of
fear shakes your foundations. The shaking of the foundations is very
real, remember. The fear is like a dream, a nightmare, but after a
nightmare when you are awake the after-effects still persist, the
hangover persists. Your breathing has changed, you are perspiring, your
body is still trembling, you are hot. Now you know that it was just a
nightmare,</p><p><br></p><p>a dream, non-substantial, but even this knowing will take time to
penetrate to the very core of your being. Meanwhile the effect of the
non-substantial dream will continue. Fear is a nightmare.</p><p><br></p><p>You ask me, “WHAT IS FEAR MADE OF?” Fear is made of ignorance of
one’s own self. There is only one fear; it manifests in many ways, a
thousand and one can be the manifestations, but basically fear is one,
and that is that “Deep inside, I may not be.” And in a way it is true
that you are not.</p><p>God is, you are not. The host is not, the Guest is. And because you
are suspicious – and your suspicion is very valid – you don’t look in.
You go on pretending that you are; you know that if you look in you are
not. This is a deep, tacit understanding. It is not intellectual, it is
existential, it is in your very guts, the feel that “I may not be. It is
better not to look in. Go on looking out.” At least it keeps you
befooled, it keeps the illusion intact that “I am”. But because this
feeling of ‘I amness’ is false, it creates fear; anything can destroy
it, any deep encounter can shatter it. It can be shattered by love, it
can be shattered by meeting a Master, it can be shattered by a great
disease, it can be shattered by seeing someone die. It can be shattered
in many ways, it is very fragile. You are managing it somehow by not
looking in.</p><p>Mulla Nasrudin was traveling on a train. The ticket collector came;
he asked for the ticket. He looked in all his pockets, in all his
suitcases, and the ticket was not found. And he was perspiring, and he
was becoming more and more frightened. And then the ticket collector
said, “Sir, but you have not looked in one of your pockets. Why don’t
you look in it?”</p><p><br></p><p>Mulla Nasrudin said, “Please don’t talk about that pocket. I am not
going to look in it. That is my only hope! If I look in that pocket and
it is not found, then it is not, then it is ABSOLUTELY not. I cannot
look in that pocket. Mind you, I will look in everything else; that
pocket is my safety, I can still hope that it may be in that pocket. I
have left it deliberately and I am not going to touch it. Whether I find
the ticket or not, I am not going to look in THAT particular
pocket.”</p><p><br></p><p>This is the situation about the ego too. You don’t look in, that is
your only hope: “Who knows? Maybe it is.” But if you look, your tacit
feeling says it is not.</p><p>This false ego which you have created by not looking in, by
continuously looking out, is the root cause of fear. You will be afraid
of all those spaces in which you have to look. You will be afraid of
beauty because beauty simply throws you in. A beautiful sunset, and all
those luminous colors in the clouds, and you will be afraid to look at
it because such great beauty is bound to throw you in. Such great beauty
stops thinking: for a moment the mind is in such awe, it forgets how to
think, how to go on spinning and weaving. The inner talk comes to a
stop, a halt, and you are suddenly in.</p><p><br></p><p>People are afraid of great music, people are afraid of great poetry,
people are afraid of deep intimacy. People’s love affairs are just
hit-and-run affairs. They don’t go deep into each other’s being because
going deep into each other’s being, the fear is there – because the
other’s pool of being will reflect you. In that pool, in that mirror of
the other’s being, if you are not found, if the mirror remains empty, if
it reflects nothing, then what?</p><p>People are afraid of love. They only pretend, they only go on playing
games in the name of love. They are afraid of meditation; even in the
name of meditation, at the most, they go on doing new ways of thinking.
That’s what Maharishi Mahesh Yogi’s Transcendental Meditation is – it is
neither</p><p><br></p><p>meditation nor transcendental. It is simply chanting a mantra, and
chanting a mantra is nothing but a process of thought, concentrated
thought. It is again a new device, a device not to meditate. People are
repeating Christian prayers, Mohammedan prayers, Hindu prayers, all ways
to avoid meditation. These are not meditations, remember. Mind is so
cunning that in-the name of meditation it has created many
pseudo-phenomena.</p><p><br></p><p>Meditation is when you are not doing anything at all, when the mind
is not functioning at all. That non- functioning of the mind is
meditation – no chanting, no mantra, no image, no concentration. One
just simply is. In that isness the ego disappears, and with the ego the
shadow of the ego disappears. That shadow is fear.</p><p>Fear is one of the most important problems, Hamid. Each human being
has to go through it and has to come to a certain understanding about
it. The ego gives you the fear that one day you may have to die. You go
on deceiving yourself that death happens only to others, and in a way
you are right: some neighbor dies, some acquaintance dies, some friend
dies, your wife dies, your mother dies – it always happens to somebody
else, never to you. You can hide behind this fact: maybe you are an
exception, you are not going to die. The ego is trying to protect
you.</p><p><br></p><p>But each time somebody dies, something in you becomes shaky. Each
death is a small death to you. Never send somebody to ask for whom the
bell tolls, it tolls for thee. Each death is your death. Even when a dry
leaf falls from the tree, it is your death. Hence we go on protecting
ourselves.</p><p>Somebody is dying and we talk about the immortality of the soul, and
the leaf is falling from the tree and we say “Nothing to be worried
about. Soon the spring will come and the tree will have another foliage.
This is only a change, only the garments are being changed.”</p><p><br></p><p>People believe in the immortality of the soul not because they know
but because they are afraid. The more cowardly a person is, the more is
the possibility that he will believe in the immortality of the soul –
not that he is religious, he is simply cowardly. The belief in the
immortality of the soul has nothing to do with religion. The religious
person knows that “I am not”, and then whatsoever is left is immortal –
but it has nothing to do with ‘me’. This ‘me’ is not immortal, this ‘I’
is not immortal. This ‘I’ is very temporary; it is manufactured by
us.</p><p><br></p><p>Fear is the shadow of ‘I’, and because the ‘I’ is always alert
somewhere deep down that “I will have to disappear in death”.… The basic
fear is of death; all other fears only reflect the basic one. And the
beauty is that death is as nonexistential as ego, and between these two
non-existentials – the ego and death – the bridge is fear.</p><p>Fear is very impotent, it has no power. You say, “If IT IS
NON-SUBSTANTIAL, THEN HOW DOES IT MANAGE TO HAVE SUCH A POWER OVER ME?”
YOU want to believe in it – that’s its power. You are not ready to take
a plunge into your inner depth and to face your inner emptiness – that
is its power. Otherwise it is impotent, utterly impotent. Nothing is
ever born out of fear. Love gives birth, love is creative; fear is
impotent.</p><p>Mr. and Mrs. Smith were brought before the bar of justice. “I would
like to divorce this character,” said the wife.</p><p><br></p><p>“I would like to get rid of this battle axe,” screamed the
husband.</p><p><br></p><p>Judge: “How many children do you have?” Wife: “Three children.”</p><p><br></p><p>Judge: “Why don’t you stay married one more year and have another
child, then you will have four. You can each take two and you will both
be satisfied.”</p><p>Husband: “Yeah, but supposing we have twins?”</p><p><br></p><p>Wife: “Ha! Look at my little twin-maker. If I depended on him, I
wouldn’t have these three either!”</p><p><br></p><p>Fear is utterly impotent. It has never created anything. It cannot
create; it is not. But it can destroy your whole life, it can surround
you like a dark, dark cloud, it can exploit all your energies. It will
not allow you to move into any deep experience of beauty, poetry, love,
joy, celebration, meditation. No, it will keep you just on the surface
because it can exist only on the surface. It is a ripple on the
surface.</p><p><br></p><p>Hamid, go in, look in, and if it is empty, so what?then that’s our
nature, then that’s what we are. Why should one be worried about
emptiness? Emptiness is as beautiful as the sky. Your inner being is
nothing but the inner sky. The sky is empty, but it is the empty sky
that holds all, the whole existence, the sun, the moon, the stars, the
earth, the planets. It is the empty sky that gives space to all that is.
It is the empty sky that is the background of all that exists. Things
come and go and the sky remains the same.</p><p><br></p><p>In exactly the same way, you have an inner sky; it is also empty.
Clouds come and go, planets are born and disappear, stars arise and die,
and the inner sky remains the same, untouched, untarnished, unscarred.
We call that inner sky SAKSHIN, the witness – and that is the whole goal
of meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>Go in, enjoy the inner sky. Remember, whatsoever you can see, you are
not it. You can see thoughts, then you are not thoughts; you can see
your feelings, then you are not your feelings; you can see your dreams,
desires, memories, imaginations, projections, then you are not them. Go
on eliminating all that you can see. Then one day the tremendous moment
arrives, the most significant moment of one’s life, when there is
nothing left to be rejected. All the seen has disappeared and only the
seer is there. That seer is the empty sky.</p><p><br></p><p>To know it is to be fearless, and to know it is to be full of love.
To know it is to be God, is to be immortal.</p><p><br></p><p>The second question:</p><p><br></p><p>BELOVED OSHO, WHAT IS LOVE?</p><p>Swami Anand Tallis,</p><p><br></p><p>LOVE is the radiance, the fragrance of knowing oneself, of being
oneself.</p><p><br></p><p>Anand Tallis is very young – he is only nine – but he is far ahead of
his age. His mental age must be almost double that, nearabout eighteen,
hence the question.</p><p>Love is overflowing joy. Love is when you have seen who you are; then
there is nothing left except to share your being with others. Love is
when you have seen that you are not separate from existence. Love is
when you have felt an organic, orgasmic unity with all that is.</p><p><br></p><p>Love is not a relationship, Tallis. Love is a state of being; it has
nothing to do with anybody else. One is not in love, one is love. And of
course when one is love, one is in love – but that is an outcome, a by-
product, that is not the source. The source is that one is love.</p><p><br></p><p>And who can be love? Certainly, if you are not aware of who you are,
you cannot be love. You will be fear. Fear is just the opposite of love.
Remember, hate is not the opposite of love, as people think; hate is
love standing upside down, it is not the opposite of love. The real
opposite of love is fear. In love one expands, in fear one shrinks. In
fear one becomes closed, in love one opens. In fear one doubts, in love
one trusts. In fear one is left lonely, in love one disappears; hence
there is no question of loneliness at all. When one is not, how can one
be lonely? Then these trees and the birds and the clouds and the sun and
the stars are still within you. Love is when you have known your inner
sky.</p><p>And Tallis, this is the right moment, the right age, to enter into
the world of love. This is the time when parents, the society, the state
and the church go on poisoning children and making them afraid. This is
the time when fear is created by the exploiters. This is the time when
society reduces small children to slaves; and one can be reduced to a
slave only if great fear is created.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the time also – if the society is sane and is not dominated
by stupid politicians and priests, if the society is not pathological –
when the society will help the children to become more and more loving,
will help the children to know more about beauty, about music, about
poetry, about dance, about meditation. This is the time when the child
can simply take a plunge without any difficulties. Later on it will
become more and more difficult, because as you grow old, fears also grow
older and stronger. As you grow old the ego becomes more strengthened.
As you grow old your capacity to learn decreases. As you grow old you
become more and more cowardly, afraid of the unknown.</p><p>The young child is free of fear; children are born without any fear.
If the society can help and support them to remain without fear, can
help them to climb the trees and the mountains, and swim the oceans and
the rivers, if the society can help them in every possible way to become
adventurers, adventurers of the unknown, and if the society can create a
great enquiry instead of giving them dead beliefs, then the children
will turn into great lovers, lovers of life – and that is true religion.
There is no higher religion than love.</p><p><br></p><p>Tallis, meditate, dance, sing, and go deeper and deeper into
yourself. Listen to the birds more attentively. Look at the flowers with
awe, wonder. Don’t become knowledgeable, don’t go on labelling things.
That’s what knowledgeability is– the great art of labelling everything,
categorizing everything. From this age, start playing guitar or learn to
play the flute. Meet people, mix with people, with as many people as
possible, because each person expresses a different facet of God. Learn
from</p><p><br></p><p>people. Don’t be afraid, this existence is not your enemy. This
existence mothers you, this existence is ready to support you in every
possible way. Trust, and you will start feeling a new upsurge of energy
in you; that energy is love. That energy wants to bless the whole
existence, because in that energy one feels blessed. And when you feel
blessed what else can you do except bless the whole existence?</p><p><br></p><p>Love is a deep desire to bless the whole existence. The third
question:</p><p>OSHO, WHY ARE SO MANY PEOPLE ATTRACTED TOWARDS YOU FROM ALL PARTS OF
THE WORLD?</p><p>Niranjan,</p><p><br></p><p>DON’T know! I am also surprised; it should not be so. The government
is against me, the society is against me, all the religions are against
me, and still people go on coming. All kinds of barriers are created,
still people go on coming.</p><p><br></p><p>Something mysterious is happening, something which cannot be
explained. Something is transpiring which is elusive. That’s why those
who come as observers or spectators or journalists cannot catch hold of
it. So they collect rumors in the town from people who never come here,
and they go on reporting. Almost all over the world, in almost all the
languages, there are rumors and rumors. This is very strange! The people
have not experienced what is happening here, they have not been
participants, and yet they think they have understood.</p><p><br></p><p>There are things which can be understood only when you participate.
You cannot know what love is if you see two lovers hugging each other.
If you watch from the outside, scientifically, you will know that two
persons are hugging. But where is love? What is love? The meeting of the
bones and the meeting of the flesh is not love. Two persons kissing...
you cannot explain it through chemistry, that would be destroying the
whole truth of it. Chemistry cannot explain it.</p><p>People come here: unless they are participants – and not only
participants in order to report, because then they are not participants
at all.… Then deep down they are outside. They are taking notes,
invisible notes about what they are going to report. They are not drunk
with the wine that is available here.</p><p>This is a place for drunkards. This is a place for people who are
crazy for God. This is a place of love. You can see people dancing and
you will shrug your shoulders: “So what? How can dance be meditation?” –
because you see only the gestures, you don’t see the dancer disappearing
within. And you CANNOT see. When the dancer disappears and only the
dance remains, it is meditation. If the dancer is there then it is only
dance, not meditation. When the singer disappears and only the song
remains, it is meditation. When the musician is not found and only music
remains, then it is meditation. But how are you going to find it from
the outside? It is impossible.</p><p><br></p><p>Niranjan, you will have to become a participant. The only way to know
what wine can do to you is to drink it.</p><p><br></p><p>Many years ago in a rural district a farmer was helping at his wife’s
delivery by holding the kerosene lamp. When the doctor had produced not
one, but three fine babies, the farmer ran away.</p><p>“Come back with that lamp,” said the doctor. “I think there is
another.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I will not!” answered the farmer. “I think it is the light that is
attracting them!”</p><p>So I don’t know what is happening! Maybe it is because of the light
that people go on coming from every corner of the world. And the lamp
that I am holding is not such that I can hide it; I cannot even escape.
It cannot be put out – it is something that is beyond me, it is
something that surpasses me. I am as much surprised by it as you are. I
am as much intrigued by it as you are, so I cannot give you an exact
answer as to why people are attracted. You will have to feel it
yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>You have also come here. Now get deeper, deeper into me and into the
space that is being created here. That is the only way to know, there is
no other.</p><p><br></p><p>The fourth question:</p><p><br></p><p>THANK YOU, OSHO. I STILL DON’T KNOW WHAT TO DROP, BUT THANK YOU.</p><p><br></p><p>Chaitanya Kabir,</p><p><br></p><p>THIS is beautiful. This is how it should be. In fact there is nothing
to drop. Just the understanding that the ego is not something to be
dropped, just the seeing that it is not, is the dropping. The seeing is
the dropping. The understanding is the liberation.</p><p>Jesus says, “Truth liberates,” but I would like to tell you, truth
liberates only when it is your own. Jesus’ truth cannot liberate you. My
truth cannot liberate you, only your own truth. Liberation cannot come
from the outside, liberation has to arise within you.</p><p><br></p><p>And this is good, Kabir, that you say, “I STILL DON’T KNOW WHAT TO
DROP, BUT THANK YOU,” because you have started seeing. And the moment
you start seeing you will not find anything to drop. The deeper you go
into the ego the more non-substantial you find it. And once you have
looked through and through, you simply laugh at the whole thing. It is
so ridiculous, because it is not there! And how long it has tortured
you; and for how many lives it has been a hell to you; how many miseries
it has created for you! Incalculable has been the harm – by something
which is not in the first place.</p><p><br></p><p>The ego is a misunderstanding, so when you understand, the
misunderstanding disappears. It is as if you have been calculating and
you have put two plus two is five, and the whole calculation goes wrong.
Then suddenly you look, you find the error, you see where you had gone
wrong – two plus two is not five, two plus two is four.</p><p><br></p><p>You need not drop anything, there is nothing to drop. Simply seeing
the error, the error disappears. Ego is a misunderstanding.</p><p><br></p><p>Two young lovers were strolling along a garden path. The boy felt
exceptionally romantic. “Some moon in the sky, eh, honey?” he
remarked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, dear,” she agreed, “some moon in the sky.”</p><p>He steered her towards a part of the path where roses were blooming.
“Some roses out there, eh, honey?” he nudged.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, dear,” she admitted, “some roses out there.”</p><p><br></p><p>By this time the dew was already shining on the grass and in his
exuberance, the boy could not help remark, “Some dew on the grass, eh,
honey?”</p><p>“Yeah, some do on the grass,” she snapped. “But I don’t, so be on
your way.”</p><p><br></p><p>The ego is a very simple misunderstanding. It is just a fault in
calculation, just a linguistic fallacy – just as your name is only part
of the utilitarian world. A name has to be given; without a name it will
be difficult to manage in ordinary life, but you know perfectly well
that a name is not a reality. Still, if somebody insults you by
insulting your name you will be offended, although when you came into
the world you had no name. Your parents called you Rama so you became
Rama; they called you Chris, you became Chris. They could have called
you something else, but now if somebody says something against Rama or
Chris you are offended, you go mad. You are ready to kill or be killed –
for a name which is only a utility, not a reality.</p><p>So is the case with the ‘I’: it is also a utility. One has to call
oneself something, otherwise things become very difficult. If you all
start using the third person, if you all start calling yourselves he or
she, it will become very difficult. Things will become more complicated,
it won’t help anybody. It is only to be understood. Even when people
become enlightened they go on using the word ‘I’, but then it is only a
word. Still they go on using their names, but now they are only
labels.</p><p><br></p><p>You cannot insult Buddha by insulting his name, because he knows he
is not it. You cannot insult Buddha by insulting his personality,
because he knows he is not it either. In fact you cannot insult him
because he knows he is always the witness, and the witness cannot be
insulted. That is the miracle, because when you are insulting, the
witness is witnessing the insult. You cannot insult the witness: he will
always be the witness, you cannot reduce him into anything else. It
always escapes any traps you put upon it, it is never found in those
traps, it simply disappears. It is always standing out, always standing
out; you cannot put it into a prison.</p><p>Chaitanya Kabir, there is nothing to drop. One just has to see it,
that there is nothing to drop. And there is nothing to gain either. All
is as it should be. And I am happy that that understanding is arising in
you – hence your thankfulness.</p><p><br></p><p>The fifth question:</p><p><br></p><p>OSHO, WHY CAN’T I UNDERSTAND YOU?</p><p><br></p><p>Maria,</p><p><br></p><p>THERE is no need to understand ME at all. What is needed is to
understand yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>How is it going to help you if you understand me? And what will you
understand in understanding me? You will understand what I say, you will
collect it, you will become more knowledgeable, and that is not going to
help. In fact it can even become a great hindrance. All knowledge
becomes a hindrance to wisdom.</p><p>I am here not to make you understand ME, I am here to help you to
understand yourself. You have to watch your own actions, your
relationships, your moods more closely: how you are when you are alone,
how you are when you are with people, how you behave, how you react,
whether your reactions are past-oriented, fixed patterns of thought or
you are spontaneous, responsible. Watch all these things, go on watching
your own mind, heart. That’s what has to be understood, that is the book
to be opened. You are the unopened book.</p><p><br></p><p>And millions of people die as unopened books, their pages uncut.
Please don’t die as an unopened book. Read: go deep into your being. You
are carrying all the Vedas and all the Bibles and all the Korans in you.
You are carrying all that has happened to humanity or can ever happen to
humanity. You represent in a tiny drop, in a dewdrop, all the oceans,
past, present, future. In your small flowering will be represented all
the flowers.</p><p>You are not to be worried about what I say. How can you understand it
in the first place? I speak from my heights using the same language that
you use, because there is no other language, but I give those words
different meanings, twists and turns. When you listen to those words you
listen according to your own mind, according to your own conditioning.
How can you understand me?</p><p>You can love me, but you cannot understand me. But if you love me, a
great understanding will arise. And that will not arise through
understanding my words, but by understanding your own being. The deeper
your understanding about yourself, the deeper will be your penetration
into my words.</p><p><br></p><p>And then there are different kinds of people: a Buddha is one type,
Jesus is a totally different type. A man who can easily understand Jesus
may not be able to understand Buddha easily, may find it almost
impossible.</p><p><br></p><p>You are here; you may not find it easy to understand me. That is one
of the reasons why I am speaking on so many enlightened Masters – so
that I can use different languages, so that I can become helpful to
different types of people. One who can understand Tilopa may not be able
to understand Kabir, and one who can understand Kabir may not be able to
understand Saraha. I will speak on different Masters; different Masters
are just different excuses to approach different types of people. And
all types of people have gathered around me.</p><p>This is happening for the first time, remember; this has not happened
before. This is utterly unique. Thousands had gathered around Buddha,
but they were of a single type, the type for which Buddha</p><p><br></p><p>had appeal. Thousands had gathered around Mahavir, the type for which
Mahavir had appeal. And Mahavir and Buddha were both contemporaries –
and the people who had gathered with Mahavir remained with Mahavir and
the people who had gathered with Buddha remained with Buddha, and they
could never understand each other’s Master. The followers of Mahavir
could not understand what Buddha was talking about, it all looked like
nonsense to them: There is no self? What more nonsensical statement
could there be?</p><p><br></p><p>Self, supreme self, is the center of Mahavir’s thinking. And when
Mahavir uses the words ‘Supreme self’ with a capital S, he means exactly
the same thing as when Buddha uses the words ‘no-self’. The supreme self
is not the ego. In the supreme self there is no idea of ‘I’, that’s why
Buddha calls it no-self When there is no ‘I’ why call it self? Supreme
self will make the ‘I’ look even bigger.</p><p>These are different people; different is their language, although
they are expressing the same truth. Around Jesus there was a certain
kind of people, but only one type. With me it is a totally different
phenomenon. Here there are Christians, and Mohammedans, and Buddhists,
and Jains, and Hindus, and Parsees, and Sikhs, and Jews, and all kinds
of people. This is a world gathering.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha lived in a small place, just in a small province, Bihar. The
province was named because of Buddha. ‘Bihar’ means ‘wandering of the
Enlightened One’, the place of his wanderings. He wandered in a small
place.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus was never heard of beyond his small country. His country was of
almost no importance. It became important only because of him, and only
later on. Otherwise it was just an unimportant country, a desert.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard...</p><p>Two Jews were talking, and they said, “Our whole misery, this whole
hell that we have suffered down</p><p>the ages, can be put on the shoulders of Moses. He was
responsible.”</p><p><br></p><p>The other said, “I cannot understand. Why, why was Moses responsible
for all our misery? He did all he</p><p>could to help us.”</p><p><br></p><p>But the other was adamant. He said, “No! While leading us from Egypt,
if he had moved to the left</p><p>rather than to the right, all the oil would have been ours! But he
led us into a desert land.”</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus was born in a very, very unimportant country. His name was not
heard of beyond the small province where he moved. While he was alive
not much was known about him, only a few Jews had gathered around him.
So was the case with Mohammed.</p><p><br></p><p>With me it is a totally different phenomenon. Almost all kinds of
people have arrived here. This is a world gathering, this is a universal
brotherhood – for the first time. Hence I am speaking on all the
enlightened Masters. These are just excuses so that I can be available
to all kinds and all types.</p><p>Maria, if you cannot understand me right now while I am speaking on
Kabir, wait, soon I will be speaking on Buddha, maybe at that time you
will find it more close to your heart. And then I will be speaking on
somebody else. Maybe it is Zen that rings bells in your heart, or
Sufism, or Hassidism,</p><p><br></p><p>but I am going to speak on all possible Ways. If you can wait, sooner
or later you will find that something is fitting with you.</p><p><br></p><p>You cannot change your type, the type is unchangeable. The type
changes only when you go beyond it; but then you disappear. Then a pure
consciousness remains neither introvert nor extrovert, neither male nor
female, neither of the head nor of the heart.</p><p>The bus was crowded and a lanky mountaineer was sitting in a seat
next to a pretty girl whose short skirt kept creeping up over her knees.
She fought a constant, though losing battle with it. She kept pulling it
down, but as soon as she let go, it began to slide up again. In
desperation she gave it one hard yank, then looked up to meet the eyes
of her traveling companion.</p><p>“Don’t rip your calico, sister,” he advised her. “My weakness is
liquor.”</p><p><br></p><p>There are types; people have different characteristics.</p><p><br></p><p>If these talks are not getting to your heart, if you are feeling a
little at a loss, don’t be worried. Try to make the best that you can,
and be silently patient. I go on speaking every day; one never knows
when is the right moment for a certain person. It is a question of type,
and also of mood. In a certain positive mood you simply understand, with
no effort. In a negative mood you make all the efforts and still you
fail. A certain morning you are feeling in such harmony, such deep
well-being, that your eyes are clear; the mind is not noisy, you are in
a state of melody, and then something strikes home, suddenly goes in
like an arrow and penetrates the being. And one never knows when that
moment will come. So I go on talking to you every morning, I go on
shooting arrows in the dark. I know you are there – somebody is bound to
be hit. Your time, your moment, will also come. Be a little more
patient.</p><p><br></p><p>The sixth question:</p><p><br></p><p>OSHO, I HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO YOU FOR YEARS TO FIND OUT THE RIGHT
WAY TO GOD, BUT THE MORE I LISTEN, THE MORE CONFUSED I BECOME. WHAT IS
WRONG WITH ME?</p><p>Satya Prakash,</p><p><br></p><p>THERE is no right way to God. There are ways and ways, but there is
no RIGHT way to God. There are ways, but don’t seek THE way. The search
for THE way creates fanatics. And all ways are His, so don’t be too
worried about the RIGHT way.</p><p>And how can you decide what is right? You don’t know anything about
what is right and what is</p><p>wrong. If you already knew what was right there would be no need to
search.</p><p><br></p><p>You must be carrying a certain idea in your head. You must be
carrying an a priori criterion, a conclusion given by others to you, and
you must be judging according to that criterion. That’s why you go on
missing me. And rather than a clarity happening to you, you are becoming
more and more confused.</p><p><br></p><p>My own observation is that people who come with a conclusion already
with them always become confused when they listen to me, because there
is a constant struggle between what I am saying and their conclusion.
Between these two they are crushed.</p><p><br></p><p>People who come here without any conclusion immediately start
attaining to clarity.</p><p><br></p><p>So that is what is wrong with you: you must be carrying a hidden
conclusion – Hindu, Christian, Buddhist, Jain. In a way you have already
arrived, deep down in your heart you think you know. Now the only
question is to find somebody who can support your conclusion. You are
not in search of a Master, you are in search of somebody who can
strengthen your ego, who can strengthen your knowledge, who can supply
you with more information supportive to what you already believe.</p><p>And because I don’t support any knowledge – I destroy all kinds of
knowledge, I go on pulling away brick by brick all that you know slowly,
slowly, until one day you find the whole earth beneath your feet has
disappeared – hence the confusion. Listening to me, you have become
attached to me too, and you are not yet detached from your old
conclusions. Hence you are pulled apart in two directions, opposite
directions, and because of those opposite directions you are in a
confusion.</p><p><br></p><p>Either you have to drop listening to me or you have to drop your
conclusions. If you drop listening to me you will have a kind of
certainty, not clarity but certainty; a kind of certainty – the stupid
kind. Because you don’t know much, you can think that you know enough. A
little knowledge is dangerous because it can give you the feeling that
you have arrived.</p><p><br></p><p>An intelligent person knows that one is always arriving but never
arrives, that life remains a pilgrimage, an eternal pilgrimage. One is
approaching closer and closer to God every day, but this is an eternal
process. One cannot say one day that “I have arrived.” When somebody
says “I have arrived”, he is simply saying that all his resources are
finished, that he is no more interested in the pilgrimage, that he is no
more interested in the journey, that he is tired, that he is weary, that
he wants to settle.</p><p><br></p><p>The real seeker goes on and on. And the joy of the journey is so
infinite, who bothers to arrive? And the most stupid person is one who
has not even taken a single step on the way and still has the idea that
he knows what is right and what is wrong.</p><p>If you drop listening to me you will have a kind of certainty: the
certainty that ignorance gives, the certainty that false knowledge,
borrowed knowledge gives, the certainty that will make you more and more
stupid, more and more unintelligent.</p><p><br></p><p>Or you can drop your conclusions and come along with me. All the
certainty that you have will disappear. I cannot promise you any
certainty. I can promise you only infinite uncertainty, but clarity will
arise, your mind will be unclouded. And in that clarity is truth, in
that clarity you are able to see what life is. You may not be able to
come to any conclusion – because life is vast and cannot be reduced to
any conclusion – but you will be able to enjoy the bliss of existence.
You may not be able to make a theory out of it, a system of thought out
of it, but great poetry will arise in you, and great dance and great
love and great compassion. Your life will become a rejoicing.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t promise any philosophy of life, I only promise a new way, a
new style of life.</p><p><br></p><p>You say, “I HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO YOU FOR YEARS TO FIND OUT THE
RIGHT WAY TO</p><p>GOD.” You seem to have arrived at right and wrong about almost
everything, even about God. How do you know that God is? What certainty
have you got about God? You have already decided that God is; now you
are searching for the way?</p><p>God is not a hypothesis. You cannot start with God, you can start
only with an open heart, an enquiry into what is. You cannot call it
God, you can simply call it an enquiry into whatsoever is: “I don’t know
what it is, God or no God, but I want to enquire.” Then you don’t seek a
way to God, then you seek a totally different thing. You sc ck methods
of enquiry, not ways to God. And I can teach you methods of enquiry.</p><p><br></p><p>Meditation, all kinds of meditations, are methods of enquiry, not
ways to God. Yes, if you go on enquiring, one day God is revealed, but
that is not for you to decide in the beginning. It happens one day when
your heart is really clear, with no clouds in your inner sky. That which
is revealed is called by a few people, God; by a few others, no-God; by
a few, truth; by a few others, beauty; by a few, paradise; by a few
others, NIRVANA. And there have been many who have not called it
anything at all, they have remained completely silent about it.</p><p><br></p><p>One of the greatest philosophers of this age, Ludwig Wittgenstein,
says – one of his most important aphorisms “That which cannot be said
should not be said.” Many have followed this dictum down the ages.
Buddha has not said anything for or against God. He must have been asked
thousands of times, but he would never say anything about it.</p><p><br></p><p>Whenever I come across somebody asking Buddha about God in the
Buddhist scriptures I always remember a small anecdote.…</p><p>A husband came home very late in the night. The night was almost
gone, it was three o’clock in the morning. He entered his wife’s room,
and was very much shocked, because his wife was in the bed with some
stranger. Before he could say anything – because he was so shocked that
for a moment he could not find the right words – the wife asked, “Where
have you been? Why are you so late?”</p><p><br></p><p>And the husband asked, “First tell me, who is this man in the bed?”
And the wife said, “Don’t change the subject!”</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha always changes the subject – whenever you ask about God he
talks about something else, immediately. He simply by-passes the
subject. Why? – because he does not want to say yes or no. His respect
of the ultimate is so deep that to say yes would be wrong, to say no
would be wrong, because yes gives a limitation as much as no gives a
limitation. No word can be unlimited, each word becomes a limitation. He
never defines, because all definitions limit. He is so respectful of the
ultimate, towards the ultimate, that he simply does not talk about it.
He will not even say this much, that “Nothing can be said about it.”</p><p>Once he was asked, “If you don’t want to say anything about God, why
don’t you say at least that nothing can be said about it? – because
that’s what the seers of the Upanishads have been saying: ‘Nothing can
be said about it. God is ANIRVACHANIYA, unspeakable, indefinable,
ineffable.’ Why can’t you say this much, that nothing can be said about
Him?”</p><p><br></p><p>And Buddha said, “Even to say that would be saying something about
Him.”</p><p><br></p><p>You see the delicate point? Even to say that would be saying
something about Him. If nothing can be said about Him you have said
something already, you have given a definition already. If you say He is
indefinable, then this is your definition. If you say He is unspeakable,
you have spoken. There has been a long tradition of many mystics who
have simply kept quiet, who have not uttered a single word.</p><p>But you have come here, Satya Prakash, with a certain idea,
conclusion. You already believe in God, now you are searching for the
way. Your name makes me suspect that you may belong to one of the most
fanatical religious sects that has developed in this country in the last
century, Arya Samaj, because this name, Satya Prakash, is usually used
by she Arya Samajis, the followers of Dayananda. It is one of the most
fanatical sects that has evolved in this liberal country. It is almost
as fanatical as the Mohammedans.</p><p><br></p><p>Now in the Indian parliament a bill is going to come named ‘Freedom
for Religion’ or ‘Freedom of Religion’. It is supported by Arya Samajis
all over the country; they are the only supporters of it. The name is
just the opposite of what it really means to do: if it becomes a law
then it will become impossible for anybody in India to change his
religion.</p><p><br></p><p>It is called ‘Freedom of Religion’, and it will destroy all freedom
of choice. It is basically against the Christians who convert Hindus; no
conversion should be allowed. Christians are against it; they are
demonstrating all over the country, making resolutions that it should
not be made a law. Only Christians are against it, and only Arya Samajis
are for it, and nobody else is saying anything else – and both are in
the same boat. Arya Samajis are interested that no Hindu should ever go
out of the Hindu fold, and the Christians are interested that as many
Hindus as they can convert into Christians, they should convert, by fair
or foul means.</p><p>Satya Prakash, you may be an Arya Samaji. And my experience of
different religious people is that the Arya Samajis seem to be the most
closed;Jains, Buddhists, Hindus, Sikhs are not so closed. Arya Samaj is
a reaction against the Mohammedans and the Christians. In fact Arya
Samaj should not be counted as an Indian religion at all; it is a
reaction against Christianity and Mohammedanism, and reactions always
reflect the original source. It is like the Christians and like the
Mohammedans: very closed, adamant, stubborn.</p><p><br></p><p>If you are not an Arya Samaji, very good. If you are, please drop
that. Then only can you understand what I am saying to you, and only
then will it not be confusing. Otherwise, you will become crazy.</p><p><br></p><p>You say, “WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME?”</p><p>This is wrong with you: that you are listening with all kinds of
prejudices. Listen with no mind, listen neither for nor against. I am
not saying to believe whatsoever I say, no, not at all. There is no need
to believe, there is no need to disbelieve either; simply listen. Why
can’t you simply listen?</p><p><br></p><p>And there is a beauty in truth. If you listen silently without a for
or against, if truth is uttered, it immediately stirs your heart. A
dance arises in your being, you start feeling in deep sympathy. And
finally you become so deeply attuned with it that there comes no time to
think about whether to</p><p><br></p><p>believe in it or not. If it is not truth then no bell rings in your
heart, you remain unaffected by it, but no decision is needed on the
part of the mind.</p><p><br></p><p>And one thing more: my whole effort here IS to confuse you, because
unless I confuse you I cannot create clarity. You are settled, you are
certain. I have to shake you, shock you, I have to confuse you; only
then will you start seeking and searching for new planes of clarity.</p><p>So in a way this is good, this is not wrong. It is good that you are
confused. Something IS happening –</p><p>your foundations are being shaken.</p><p>They were seated on adjoining stools in a dimly-lighted cocktail
lounge. “Honey,” he said, “what about</p><p>forgetting your inhibitions and spending a quiet week-end with me in
Atlantic City?”</p><p><br></p><p>“See here,” she answered, “after an exhaustive perusal of the corpus
of documented evidence garnered by research on heterosexuality as
applied to contemporary sociological mores, and in view of the innate
predisposition to the more exotic manifestations of concupiscence
evident in your demeanor, a categorical negative is my answer.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But honey,” he said, “I just don’t get it.” “That’s what I mean,”
she answered.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what I mean! If you are confused, it is a good sign, it shows
intelligence. Only an intelligent person can be confused. A stupid
person cannot be confused; you cannot shake him, you cannot shock him.
He is ABSOLUTELY certain. Remember, only fools are absolutely
certain.</p><p>Mulla Nasrudin was saying to one of his disciples, “Never be
absolutely certain because only fools are absolutely certain.”</p><p><br></p><p>And the disciple asked, “Mulla, are you absolutely certain about it?”
And he said, “Yes!”</p><p><br></p><p>An intelligent person is always available to hesitation. The more
intelligent you are, the more easily you become available to
hesitations, because each hesitation is a new beginning, a new search, a
new enquiry.</p><p>But if you have come here not to be confused, if you have come here
to gain more certainty – not clarity but certainty – if you have come
here to attain to more knowledge so that you can become more wise, so
that you can attain to God more easily, more certainly, so that not only
in this life but in the afterlife also you have a guarantee, an
insurance, if you have come to find a certain catechism, certain
principles, fixed theories, dogmas, then you have come to a wrong
place.</p><p><br></p><p>I am not a scripture, I am a living light. You can learn how to see
by being with me, but I will not give you commandments. And commandments
never help anyway, because life goes on changing and principles are
always out-of-date.</p><p><br></p><p>A devoted husband commissioned a Frenchman to paint his wife’s
portrait. She was quite nervous during the first sitting and said to the
painter, “I realize I am not young any more. I would like a good
likeness, but please paint me with sympathy.”</p><p><br></p><p>When the portrait was completed, the husband gave a party and invited
a hundred friends to the unveiling. As the cover was removed, there was
a beautiful likeness of his wife, but a gasp of horror shook the
audience, for the picture showed a man’s hand reaching into the lady’s
bosom.</p><p><br></p><p>“How dare you insult my wife like this?” shouted the irate
husband.</p><p>“Insult your wife!” exclaimed the painter. “How can you accuse me of
that when I did everything I could to please her? She requested me to
paint her with sympathy and when I looked up the word ‘sympathy’ in your
dictionary. it said. ‘A fellow feeling in your bosom’.”</p><p><br></p><p>C H A P T E R 7</p><p><br></p><p>T h e g o d wh o m I l o ve i s i n s i d e</p><p><br></p><p>2 M a y 1 9 7 9 a m i n B u d d h a H a l l</p><p><br></p><p>INSIDE THIS CLAY JUG THERE ARE CANYONS AND PINE MOUNTAINS, AND THE

before: though we know not just when, or why, or how, or where.</p><p><br></p><p>Men have left G O D not for other gods, they say, but for no god; and
this has never happened before that men both deny gods and worship gods,
professing first Reason,</p><p><br></p><p>And then Money, and Power, and what they call Life, or Race, or
Dialectic,</p><p>The Church disowned, the tower overthrown, the bells upturned, and
what have we to do</p><p>but stand with empty hands and palms turned upwards</p><p><br></p><p>In an age which advances progressively backwards?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, something has happened that has never happened before: for the
first time in the evolution of human consciousness man stands alienated
from God. Man stands separated from existence. Man stands lonely, with
no companion, in great darkness, with no light to lead him, guide him.
Man has never been in such despair, man has never been in such a state
of homelessness.</p><p>T.S. Eliot is right: “Something has happened that has never happened
before.” And why has it happened? How has it happened? It is difficult
to pinpoint it but not difficult to understand it in a vague way. These
things are not very tangible and they don’t happen in a certain moment.
they</p><p><br></p><p>happen so gradually, so slowly, that one never becomes really aware
of when, where, how; but a few things can be understood.</p><p><br></p><p>Man had always lived with nature. To live with nature is to live with
God in an indirect way, because nature reflects God in a thousand and
one ways. The growing trees and the faraway call of the cuckoo and the
winds in the pine trees and the rivers moving towards the ocean and the
proud mountains standing in the sun and the starry night, and it is
impossible not to be reminded of some invisible hands. It is impossible
not to see that existence is not dead but alive. The ocean heaves,
breathes; the whole existence is a growing phenomenon. It is not dead,
it cannot be dead. Everything is growing.</p><p>Because of this growing experience man has remained constantly aware
of some invisible, mysterious force behind it all. That force is called
God. God is not a person, let me repeat, but just a presence. Still when
you go deep into the Himalayas, you again start feeling a kind of
reverence, awe, wonder. Again you start feeling something that was very
easily available to the primitive man.</p><p><br></p><p>The civilized man has lost something because now we we live in the
man-made world where it is almost impossible to find any signature of
God. How can you find God on asphalt roads? They don’t grow, they don’t
breathe. How can you find God in cement structures? They are not alive!
How can you find God in machines, in technology?although it is great,
even the greatest machine cannot give you the sense of the mysterious,
of the miraculous. Even facing the greatest machine you cannot feel awe,
you cannot feel reverence, you cannot feel like falling on your knees
and praying. And if you cannot feel like falling on your knees and
praying once in a while, how can God remain a part of your being? How
can you remain alert, aware of the divine?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, “... something has happened that has never happened before:
though we know not just when, or why, or how, or where.” It is difficult
to pinpoint the exact date and time when God died – at least in our
consciousness – when God disappeared from our world. And with Him
disappeared all poetry, and with Him disappeared all dance. With Him
disappeared all that is beautiful and sacred. With Him disappeared all
for which one can live and die; now we don’t have anything worth living
or worth dying for. We are simply dragging our existence, burdened,
seeing no point in it all, just carrying on somehow because the other
alternative is suicide – that too seems pointless. To live seems
pointless, to die seems pointless.</p><p>Man is facing a tremendous flood of meaninglessness for the first
time. Everything seems to be utterly insignificant, and the reason is
simple: without God there can be no significance, without God there can
be no grandeur, without God there can be no splendor. Life can have
meaning only in the context of something that surpasses life. The
meaning always comes from the context; now man stands without a context.
The meaning comes only when you can look upwards to something bigger
than you, something greater than you. When you feel related with
something greater, holier, your life has meaning. When you feel
unrelated, uprooted, how can you feel meaning?</p><p><br></p><p>The first thing is that man has left nature and has created an
artificial world of his own. That has been the most shattering
phenomenon which has disrupted man, unbridged man from God and all that
is implied in God: meaning, significance, majesty, love, prayer,
meditation, all that is valuable, precious. Man has never been such a
beggar as he is today.</p><p><br></p><p>And the irony is, man has never been so rich, so affluent as he is
today. Both things have happened together: the inner has become poorer
and poorer and the outer has become richer and richer. We have more
money than any other society before, we have more medical facilities
than any other society before, we have in every way more power than any
other society ever had before, and still no society has ever felt such
meaninglessness, no society has ever felt such a great suicidal desire,
longing.</p><p>Secondly, we have cultivated reason too much and we have become
lopsided. God is a fee]ing, God is not a thinking. You cannot think
about God because God is not an object to think about. Science thinks,
religion feels. Science functions from the head, religion from the
heart. And because we have become too much obsessed with the head – our
whole education, our whole civilization, is obsessed with the head
because the head has made all kinds of technological advances – we think
that’s all.</p><p>What can the heart give to us? Yes, it cannot give you great
technology, it cannot give you great industry, it cannot give you money.
It can give you joy, it can give you celebration. It can give you a
tremendous feeling for beauty, for music, for poetry. It can guide you
into the world of love, and ultimately into the world of prayer, but
those things are not commodities. You cannot grow your bank balance
through the heart; and you cannot fight great wars, and you cannot make
atom bombs and hydrogen bombs, and you cannot destroy people through the
heart. The heart knows only how to create and the head knows only how to
destroy. The head is destructive, and our whole education has become
trapped in the head.</p><p>Our universities, our colleges, our schools, are all destroying
humanity. They think they are serving but they are simply befooling
themselves. Unless man becomes balanced, unless the heart and the head
both grow, man will remain in misery and the misery will go on growing.
As we become more and more hung up in the head, as we become more and
more oblivious to the existence of the heart, we will become more and
more miserable. We ARE creating hell on the earth and we will create
more and more of it. Paradise belongs to the heart.</p><p>That is the second thing that has happened: the heart is completely
forgotten, nobody understands that language any more. We understand
logic, we don’t understand love. We understand mathematics, we don’t
understand music. We become more and more accustomed to the ways of the
world and nobody seems to have the guts to move into the unknown paths,
the unknown labyrinths of love, of the heart. We have become very much
attuned to the world of prose, and poetry has simply become
non-existential.</p><p>The poet has died, and the poet is the bridge between the scientist
and the mystic. The bridge has disappeared. On one hand stands the
scientist – very powerful, tremendously powerful, ready to destroy the
whole earth, the whole of life – and on the other hand, far and few
between stand a few mystics – a Buddha, a Jesus, a Zarathustra, a Kabir.
They are utterly powerless in the sense that we understand power, and
immensely powerful in a totally different sense – but we don’t know that
language at all. And the poet has died; that has been the greatest
calamity. The poet is disappearing.</p><p>And by poet I mean the painter, the sculptor. All that is creative in
man is becoming reduced to producing more and more commodities. The
creative is losing its grip and the productive is becoming the goal of
life.</p><p><br></p><p>God can be approached only through the creative. Why? – because He is
the creator. If you want to know God you will have to have something
similar, because only the same can meet the same. You will have to learn
a little rhythm of creativity. When the musician is really in a creative
mood, in a creative space, he disappears; God starts playing on his
flute. Suddenly his flute is no longer in his own hands, it is in
Krishna’s hands. And then the flute brings something from the beyond,
something virgin, something utterly new. When the painter disappears
then his hands are just instruments for God.</p><p><br></p><p>God is the creativity, so if you really want to enter into the world
of God you will have to learn the ways of creativity – and that has
disappeared. Instead of creativity we value productivity: we talk about
how to produce more. Production can give you things but cannot give you
values. Production can make you rich outwardly but it will impoverish
you inwardly. Production is not creation. Production is very mediocre;
any stupid person can do it, one simply needs to learn the knack of
it.</p><p>Creativity is intelligence. The deeper you go in creativity the more
meditative you become.</p><p><br></p><p>And the poet has died, the poet exists no more. And what exists in
the name of poetry is almost prose. What exists in the name of painting
is more or less insane. You can see Picasso, Dali and others – it is
pathological! Picasso is a genius, but ill, pathological. His painting
is nothing but a catharsis; it helps him, it is a kind of vomiting. When
you have something wrong with your stomach the vomiting relieves you. It
helped Picasso; if he had been prevented from painting he would have
gone mad. Painting was good for him, it saved him from becoming insane,
it released his insanity onto the canvas. But what about others who will
be purchasing those paintings, hanging them in their bedrooms and
looking at them? They will start becoming ill at ease.</p><p><br></p><p>It is a totally different creativity I am talking about. A Taj
Mahal... just watching it on a full moon night, and great meditation is
bound to arise in you. Or the temples of Khajuraho, Konarak, Puri – just
meditating on them and you will be surprised that all your sexuality is
transformed into love. They are miracles of creativity. They were not
created by pathological people, they were created by those who had
attained.</p><p>The great cathedrals of Europe – they are the longings of the earth
to reach to the sky. Just seeing those great creations, a great song is
bound to arise in your heart, or a great silence is bound to descend on
you. Man has lost the poetic, the creative urge, or it has been killed.
We are too interested in commodities, in gadgets, in making more and
more things. Production is concerned with quantity, and creation is
concerned with quality. The quality has disappeared and with the
quality, God has disappeared – because God is the ultimate quality of
creation.</p><p><br></p><p>You will have to bring the heart back. You will have to be aware
again of nature. You will have to learn to watch roses, lotuses again.
You will have to make a few contacts with the trees and the rocks and
the rivers. You will have to start a dialogue with the stars again.
Otherwise God cannot be brought back to humanity, and without God
humanity is doomed, is lost.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, T. S. Eliot is right: “... something has happened that has never
happened before: though we</p><p>know not just when, or why, or how, or where. Men have left G O D not
for other gods...”</p><p>That was very usual in the past; people used to move from one god to
another. That was really very significant, it was an evolution. The God
of Moses is less sophisticated than the God of Jesus,</p><p><br></p><p>naturally; there are thousands of years between these two enlightened
persons. Moses was as enlightened as Jesus, but Moses had to talk the
language which could be understood by HIS people, and those people were
very primitive. Hence Moses spoke in the language of law, commandments:
do this, don’t do that. Law was his central emphasis.</p><p><br></p><p>By the time Jesus arrived man had evolved. Jesus talked about love,
not about law. Love was his law. Now love is a higher value than law,
certainly holier than law. Law is mundane. The God of the Jews was a
jealous God... because we make our God in our own image. The God of the
Jews was a very angry God; for small reasons he would destroy cities. A
person just commits a sin – and what is sin in the ancient concept? He
just disobeys a certain commandment – and God can destroy the whole
town! It was a very angry, violent God.</p><p>It was not really the God that was violent and angry, it was the
people. Their eyes were full of violence and anger, they could not see
the real God.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember this: God is always the same. It was exactly the same when
Moses was alive, it was exactly the same when Jesus was alive, it is
exactly the same when we are alive; it will remain the same. God is
always the same, but our eyes change.</p><p>Jesus could see God as love, as compassion. God was growing because
man was growing. And man was changing one god for another, for a higher
conception of God. Man has always been changing gods, and that’s
perfectly right. When we change, how can our rudimentary ideas of God
remain the same? When our eyes change everything changes.</p><p><br></p><p>There is a very beautiful story.…</p><p><br></p><p>There was a great saint, Ramdas. Thousands of years after Rama walked
on the earth, Ramdas was reciting his story again – after thousands of
years. The way he used to tell the story of Rama was so enchanting, so
magnetic, so charismatic, that it is said that Hanuman, the absolute
devotee of Rama, who had seen everything with his own eyes, used to come
to listen to Ramdas, of course, in disguise. He would sit in the crowd
and listen, and he enjoyed it very much.</p><p><br></p><p>Sometimes it happens that when you are involved in the action itself
you can’t see the whole thing, the perspective cannot be that big. You
are involved in the thing, you are doing your thing, and there are a
thousand and one things going on; you cannot be watchful of all.</p><p>Now the story was finished, completed. Ramdas was telling his
disciples the story of Rama, and Hanuman was very happy, utterly glad to
come, to listen. Many things that he had only heard through rumors he
was listening to again from an authentic source.</p><p><br></p><p>But one day a problem arose. Ramdas was describing when Rama’s wife,
Sita, was stolen by Ramana. He kept her on Sri Lanka in a beautiful
garden; the garden was full of white flowers. Ramdas was telling that
part of the story – that Ramana kept Sita in a beautiful garden which
was full of white flowers.</p><p><br></p><p>Now this was too much, because Hanuman had visited Sita in the garden
and he had not seen a single white flower; he had seen red flowers. So
he stood up. He forgot that he should not interfere,</p><p><br></p><p>that he was not expected to be there at all. He stood up and he said,
“Please, everything is okay, but this information you got wrong. You
change it! There was not a single white flower, all the flowers were
red, BLOODY RED.”</p><p><br></p><p>Ramdas said, “You sit silently! Who are you to correct me?”</p><p><br></p><p>In anger, Hanuman threw his blanket. He was a monkey god, so with his
tail and everything he appeared out of the blanket, and he said, “You
ask me who I am? I am the Hanuman about whom you are talking! And I was
the man who went to the garden, and you never went, you were never
there. And after thousands of years you are telling the story, and you
have got some nerve! You are telling me to keep quiet! I cannot keep
quiet! Change the story! The flowers were red, absolutely red!”</p><p>But Ramdas said, “Don’t be stupid! In the first place you are not
expected here. In the second place,</p><p>you may have gone, but I cannot change the story. I know for sure
that the flowers were white.”</p><p><br></p><p>Now this was too much. Hanuman was an eye-witness, and this man,
after five thousand years, was writing a story, and he seemed to be much
too stubborn. Not only that, he called Hanuman stupid!</p><p>He said, “You be silent! Don’t be monkeyish! I know who you are – you
just keep quiet!” Hanuman said, “I cannot allow this. You will have to
come with me. I will take you to Rama. Only</p><p>Rama can decide now – and this has to be decided.”</p><p><br></p><p>So Hanuman took Ramdas on his shoulders, flew back to heaven, reached
Rama, really angry, and said, “Look at this man! After five thousand
years he is writing a story. About everything else I have not objected
because I was not an eye-witness. And I love his story; he is a
beautiful story-teller. But about things which I was involved in he is
not ready even to listen to me. You tell him to change his story. The
flowers were all red, and he goes on insisting that they were white. Not
only that, he calls me stupid, and he tells me ‘Be quiet, and don’t
disturb and don’t interfere!’ And I say again, the flowers were red!
What do you say?”</p><p>Rama said, “Hanuman, Ramdas is right, the flowers were white. But you
were so angry because my wife was stolen, your eyes were full of blood;
hence you saw the flowers as red. You should not interfere. When persons
like Ramdas say something, it cannot be changed. It is not a question of
time – five thousand or fifty thousand years, it doesn’t make any
difference. For a man like Ramdas there is no time. He has entered into
eternity, all time has disappeared. When he is telling the story he is
not only telling the story, he is SEEING it too. For him there is no
question of time. It is not something of the past.”</p><p><br></p><p>This was too much! Hanuman said, “You also were not present there!
And this is being partial, unjust. It is unfair! I was present there!
You had not gone into the garden, so who are you? Ask Sita; she was
there, and I hope that she will not be unfair.”</p><p>And Sita started laughing and said, “Hanuman, you simply apologize.
The flowers were white; you were just so angry that you could not see
the white flowers. You imposed your anger, you were so blood-thirsty!
You just apologize to Ramdas. And make it a point that in the first
place you need</p><p><br></p><p>not go, and if you go then keep hiding and don’t interfere. Nothing
can be changed. Whatsoever Ramdas is saying is right, because he has a
more aloof, distant witnessing than you can ever have. You were too much
involved in it.”</p><p><br></p><p>That’s how it has been. When Moses talked about God, he talked about
the God which the Jews of HIS time could have understood. When Jesus
talked about God, of course, three thousand years had passed, man had
grown, had come of age; it was possible to talk about love. At least a
few people could understand him – not many, but a few. Hence he was
crucified; because the many could not understand yet.</p><p>In the past people have been changing their god.</p><p><br></p><p>One of the Indian incarnations of God is Parashuram. He killed
millions of people, his whole life was that of a killer. Another
incarnation of God is Buddha. He was absolutely non-violent; he would
not kill even an ant. Between the time of Parashuram and Buddha much
water had flowed down the Ganges. Buddha brings a new concept of God, a
new vision. It is the same God, but he gives you new eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>In the past people had been changing gods: “Men have left God not for
other gods...” But in the present day something else has happened: “Man
has not left God for other gods” – that would have been okay – “they
say, but for no god.” Man has dropped the whole idea of God, the whole
idea of a divine presence in existence, the whole idea of any meaning,
the whole idea that existence is alive, conscious: And now we are
standing empty and we are feeling empty.</p><p><br></p><p>But man cannot remain empty; it is difficult to remain empty. Just as
nature abhors a vacuum, so is it the case with the inner nature too. So
a new phenomenon is happening: “Men both deny gods and worship gods.”
They have created their own gods. They don’t worship God the Father and
the Holy Ghost and Jesus Christ any more; they have changed that old
trinity. They worship Karl Marx, Frederich Engels, V.I. Lenin – a new
trinity. Now this is very ordinary; to worship Karl Marx or Engels or
Lenin is to worship something very ordinary. And remember, whatsoever
you worship you will become, because your worship is your longing deep
down.</p><p>“Professing first Reason...” – and because man cannot remain empty
for long, he replaced it first with reason; reason became God, the head
became God. Anything that is proved by reason is truth, anything that is
not proved by reason is untruth. Now this is nonsense! Reason is
limited, it cannot prove many things.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, it cannot prove the beauty of a rose, but the beauty
exists; reason is impotent to prove it. Reason cannot prove the
existence of love, but love exists; reason is inadequate to prove it. If
you ask reason about music it will say it is only noise. It may be
arranged in such a way that it gives you an illusion of melody, but
there is no melody, only noise; it cannot see the melody. Reason is
blind. Yes, it has certain qualities, but only certain qualities. The
whole of existence is not available to it.</p><p><br></p><p>And then money became God; millions of people worship money as God.
And you will be surprised to know that this country, India, which goes
on bragging about its spirituality, which goes on bragging that it is
destined to lead the whole of humanity towards spirituality, worships
money more than any</p><p><br></p><p>other country. It actually worships! There is a festival, the
Festival of Lights, Diwali, when people worship money-notes, coins; they
actually worship! – money is God. In other countries they may not
actually be worshipping, but the worship is there unconsciously.</p><p><br></p><p>And power has become a god. The politician has become the MOST
important person in the world. The dirtiest politician is thought to be
something superhuman. We have denied God, but how can we deny our
emptiness? We have rejected God, and we had to stuff – something in the
empty space, so we stuff it with political power, with money, with
reason, with race, with dialectics – if you cannot find anything else,
then dialectical materialism, the philosophy of communism, fascism,
nazism.</p><p>Man cannot live without religion. Man cannot live without God. If the
true God is not available man is bound to create home-made gods.</p><p><br></p><p>“The Church disowned, the tower overthrown, the bells upturned, and
what have we to do but stand</p><p>with empty hands and palms turned upwards in an age which advances
progressively backwards?”</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, T.S. Eliot is right.</p><p><br></p><p>With this background try to understand Kabir’s sutras. They are of
tremendous beauty.</p><p><br></p><p>INSIDE THIS CLAY JUG THERE ARE CANYONS AND PINE MOUNTAINS, AND THE

become pure consciousness, the difference between the inside and the
outside will disappear. Then the inside will be the outside and the
outside will be the inside, because the only thing that separates you
from the outer is the glass wall of your thoughts. Once this is not
there a miracle happens: you find the whole existence inside you. You

the inner and outer meet and merge into each other and become one. This
small body is not so small as you think, it is a temple of God.</p><p>INSIDE THIS CLAY JUG...</p><p>If you look at it from the outside it is nothing but clay, it is
nothing but dust. Says Omar Khayyam, “..; Dust unto dust” – but man is
not only dust. The idea has been a very persistent idea. Do you know
that the word ‘human’ comes from HUMUS? HUMUS means dust, the earth,
clay. The word ‘Adam’ also comes from the same root; Adam means the
earth. Man is made of clay if you look from the outside; if you watch
him scientifically he is clay.</p><p>It is like watching poetry scientifically: then you will find words
but not poetry. Poetry is something between the words, in the gaps, and
between the lines, in the intervals. You need a totally different kind
of sensitivity to understand poetry. Just the words are not poetry; the
words are language, grammar. And what are words? – just different
combinations of the alphabet. Where is the poetry? If you dissect the
poetry, even the greatest poetry – of a Kalidas, Milton or Rabindranath
– if you dissect it, what will you find? Only words! And if you dissect
words, then just the alphabet.</p><p>It happened, a great spiritual preacher invited Mark Twain to one of
his sermons. They were friends, but Mark Twain had never gone to listen
to him. And the preacher wanted him to listen; he wanted him to know his
art of preaching. He wanted to be appreciated by Mark Twain. When he
insisted again and again, one day Mark Twain went with him. He had
prepared his best sermon. He talked beautifully, he made people drunk.
But he was very much puzzled and embarrassed too, because Mark Twain was
just sitting in front of him absolutely uninfluenced, unimpressed.</p><p>The sermon finished. When they were returning, driving back home, for
a few moments the preacher could not even gather courage to ask Mark
Twain, “What do you think?” And Mark Twain didn’t say a single word.
Finally, when Mark Twain was getting down from the carriage, the
preacher gathered courage and he said, “At least you owe me a few words.
How did you like my sermon? Even you did not like it, you can say so.
But don’t keep so silent – it hurts!”</p><p>Mark Twain said, “There was no question of liking or disliking it.
You are a thief! Just last night I was reading something in which each
single word that you uttered this morning is written. You are a thief
and nothing else!”</p><p>The priest was shocked. He said, “This is impossible, because I have
not stolen from anywhere. You</p><p>give me the book!”</p><p><br></p><p>And Mark Twain said, “Tomorrow morning I will send the book to
you.”</p><p>And do you know what happened? – the following morning Mark Twain
sent him a big dictionary, and</p><p>he said, “You can see: each single word that you have spoken in this
book.”</p><p>Poetry is not only words, poetry is something totally different. The
words only create the space for the poetry to become visible. The words
only create a context for the poetry to descend from the beyond.</p><p><br></p><p>Man’s body is not just clay, it is clay plus God. If you Look from
the outside it is clay, if you start looking from he inside it is the

WATER.</p><p><br></p><p>The original is far more beautiful, and the reason is the same as I
have been talking about. The original is poetry, and it is very
difficult to translate poetry from one language to another. Prose can be
translated easily. Poetry cannot be translated, never adequately;
something goes on missing because each language has its own nuances, its
own flavor. You cannot bring that flavor and nuance to another
language.</p><p>The original is:</p><p><br></p><p>IS GHAT ANTAR PARAS MOTI, ISEE MEN PARKHANHARA</p><p><br></p><p>IS GHAT ANTAR ANAHAD GARJE, ISEE MEN UTHAT FUHARA KAHAT KABIR SUNO
BHAI SADHO, ISEE MEN SAI HAMARA.</p><p><br></p><p>PARAS is a specific symbol in Eastern alchemy. Just as in the West
alchemists have been searching down the ages for the secret of
transforming the base metals into higher metals, into gold; they have
been searching for ways and means, chemical ways, to transform the lower
into the higher, the non- precious into the precious. In the East also
the same search has been there, but they have a different metaphor for
it. They call it PARAS. PARAS is a stone, a miracle stone. If any base
metal is touched by PARAS it immediately becomes gold. No other
chemistry, no other chemical processes are needed, just the touch of the
PARAS. It is a metaphor; it in fact stands for the Master. Just the
touch of the Master, just the touch of his energy, immediately
transforms the ignorant into the wise one, immediately transforms the
darkness into light, death into immortality. PARAS IS a metaphor for the
Master.</p><p><br></p><p>IS GHAT ANTAR PARAS MOTI...</p><p>Within you exists the miracle stone. If you know how to use it
everything will become gold, everything will be transformed into
diamonds.</p><p><br></p><p>... ISEE MEN PARKHANHARA...</p><p><br></p><p>And the one who can recognize this miracle stone is also resent in
you. You are not to ask somebody else. Your own witnessing self, your
own pure consciousness, is the one who knows already where the precious
stone is hidden in you. You just have to discard the garbage of the
mind, the garbage that has been given to you by the society. You have to
be just alone in yourself. When the mind drops all contents given by the
society, the witness arises in you.</p><p><br></p><p>... ISGHAT ANTAR ANAKAD GARJE..</p><p><br></p><p>And deep within you there is a music which is not created by anybody,
which is not created by hands, which is not produced on any instrument.
There is a special name for it; it is called ANAHAD. When you play on a
guitar it is called AHAD, because you strike on the strings with your
fingers.</p><p>AHAD means striking. It is created out of conflict, there is a little
aggression in it, there is struggle. The musician is struggling to
create music on the instrument, there is a kind of fight. But in the
innermost recess of your being there is neither instrument nor musician,
but music is there, without the musician and without the instrument.</p><p><br></p><p>Zen people call it ‘the sound of one hand clapping’. The Christian
mystics call it ‘the soundless sound’. It is a silence and yet it is
musical silence.</p><p><br></p><p>Again, these words of T.S. Eliot will be significant:</p><p>At the still point of the turning world. Neither flesh nor
fleshless;</p><p>Neither from nor towards; at the still point where the dance is.</p><p>But neither arrest nor movement. And do not call it fixity,</p><p>Where past and future are gathered Except for</p><p><br></p><p>the still point,</p><p><br></p><p>There would be no dance, and there is only the dance.</p><p><br></p><p>The still point... There is a point within you where nothing ever
moves – no movement from or to, no stirring, no sound created by any
instrument. Nobody is there, just stillness, but that stillness is the
dance and that stillness is the music. It is called ANAHAD.</p><p>... IS GHAT ANTAR ANAHAD GARJE, ISEE MEN UTHAT FUHARA...</p><p>And the moment you have heard that music, a great fountain bursts
forth, of joy, of bliss. You become a rejoicing, you become a dance
yourself, you become a song yourself. Then your life is religious –</p><p><br></p><p>not like the so-called saints, sad, pious and ugly. The really
religious person is one whose mer wells have started flowing, who has
become a fountain of joy, of song and dance and celebration.</p><p><br></p><p>AND THE MUSIC FROM THE STRINGS NO ONE TOUCHES, AND THE SOURCE OF ALL
WATER.</p><p><br></p><p>IF YOU WANT THE TRUTH, I WILL TELL YOU THE TRUTH:</p><p>FRIEND, LISTEN: THE GOD WHOM I LOVE IS INSIDE. Kabir</p><p><br></p><p>says: If you WANT the truth...</p><p><br></p><p>Truth cannot be imposed upon you, it cannot be forced upon you.
Unless you desire and long for it, unless you spread your hands, unless
you are.ready to receive it with great longing, intensity, unless
longing becomes a fire in you, it cannot be given to you. No Master can
give it to you, but you can take it. If your fire is enough it will be
transferred to you. It is a transmission beyond scriptures.</p><p><br></p><p>“If you want the truth,” Kabir says, “I will tell you the truth. I am
ready to tell you, I am ready to share my truth, my experience with you.
But friend, you will have to listen. Just hearing won’t do, you will
have to listen.”</p><p>Listening is totally different from hearing. Hearing, anybody who is
not deaf can do. Listening is a rare art, one of the last arts.
Listening means not only hearing with the ears but hearing from the
heart, in utter silence, in absolute peace, with no resistance. One has
to be vulnerable to listen, and one has to be in deep love to listen.
One has to be in utter surrender to listen.</p><p><br></p><p>FRIEND, LISTEN: THE GOD WHOM I LOVE IS INSIDE.</p><p><br></p><p>Kabir says: I have found Him within myself. I searched for Him
everywhere, and all search was nothing but frustration. Then I looked
within and He was there, laughing, smiling at all my stupid search. It
was so ridiculous that I was searching for the one who is already
present within me.</p><p><br></p><p>... KAHAT KABIR SUNO BHAI SADHO, ISEE MEN SAI HAMARA.</p><p><br></p><p>In this ordinary body of clay, God resides. Hence don’t be against
the body; notwithstanding what your foolish saints go on saying to you,
don’t be against the body. Love it, respect it, it is the temple of God.
It may be clay in the eyes of the scientist, but in the eyes of the
mystic God has chosen it to be His abode.</p><p><br></p><p>WHY SHOULD WE TWO EVER WANT TO PART? MOHI-TOHI LAGI KAISE CHUTE..</p><p><br></p><p>The original says: We have fallen in such love that now it cannot be
broken. We have fallen into each other so deeply that we cannot be
separated. No sword can cut us apart, it is impossible.</p><p><br></p><p>MOHI-TOHI LAGI KAISE CHUTE..</p><p><br></p><p>Now even if somebody wants and tries to separate us, it is
impossible. Even YOU cannot separate us. I am no more, only you are.
Whom can you separate from whom?</p><p><br></p><p>WHY SHOULD WE TWO EVER WANT TO PART?</p><p>The translation misses, it misses the point. It is not a question of
“Why should we two ever want to part?” No, even if we want, there is no
possibility of parting. The mystic, once he knows that God is within,
has gone beyond the point of parting. There is no possibility of any
divorce any more. He is REALLY married. And the marriage is not formal,
the marriage is like a welding. He is welded with God – not only wedded
but welded. He has become one, just like the river disappears into the
ocean – how can you separate it?Just as the milk becomes one with the
water – how can you separate it?</p><p><br></p><p>JUST AS THE LEAF OF THE WATER RHUBARB LIVES FLOATING ON THE
WATER,</p><p><br></p><p>WE LIVE AS THE GREAT ONE AND LITTLE ONE.</p><p><br></p><p>JAISE KAMALPATRA JAL BASA, AISE TUM SAHIB HAM DASA...</p><p><br></p><p>The lotus leaf has been a symbol of great importance. Down the ages
it is impossible to find a mystic who has never talked about it. All the
Buddhas have talked about it; they had to talk about it because it
represents something so significant that it cannot be ignored. It
represents the very essence of sannyas.</p><p><br></p><p>The lotus leaf has one thing of great importance about it: it lives
in water, it floats on water, but the water cannot touch it. In the
night dewdrops gather on the lotus leaf, but they remain separate; just
like pearls, separate. They cannot touch the lotus leaf. The lotus leaf
remains untouched in the water, remains in the water and yet aloof,
distant, faraway.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s how the mystic lives, the sannyasin has to live: in the world
and yet not of the world.</p><p><br></p><p>JAISE KAMALPATRA JAL BASA, AISE TUM SAHIB HAM DASA...</p><p><br></p><p>Kabir says: I am living in this world, but this world is not my
Master. YOU are my Master. I am living in this world because this is
what you want me to do; I am simply following your orders. I am living
in this world because I am just a slave of your love, I am just a shadow
to you. I have no interest in the world: I am not after money, I am not
after power, I am not after prestige. But if you want me to be in the
marketplace then it is perfectly okay. If you want me anywhere, I am
ready to go there.</p><p><br></p><p>There is a story in Buddha’s life:</p><p>One day one of Buddha’s sannyasins was passing through a street where
he had gone to beg. The most beautiful woman of that town, the
prostitute of the town, fell in love with the monk. She came down out of
her house and requested the monk to come and reside with her. And soon
the rainy season was coming so the prostitute said, “Why don’t you stay
with me during the rainy season? – because monks have to stay somewhere.
For four months, during the rainy season, monks don’t move, so you will
have to stay somewhere, you will have to find some shelter – why not
with me?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Perfectly okay. I will just have to ask my Master, ask his
permission. If he says yes, tomorrow morning I will be present at your
door.”</p><p><br></p><p>The prostitute could not believe the way the monk said it so simply,
as if there was no problem! He said, “Perfectly okay. I have to stay
somewhere. I was going to ask somebody to give me shelter for four
months, and this is a gift from you! I just have to ask my Master; it is
just a formal request because that is the way. I have to tell him that a
certain woman has requested that I stay with her. Can I stay with
her?”</p><p>Other monks heard about this, and of course they were jealous. It was
impossible to tolerate. This was too much! But they waited – they waited
because they thought Buddha would absolutely say no, categorically would
say no. A sannyasin, and staying with a prostitute?!</p><p><br></p><p>And when the monk asked Buddha, Buddha looked at the monk and said,
“Perfectly right! You can stay with her.”</p><p>Now others stood up and they said, “This is not fair! And do you see
the risk? This is a young man, and that woman is almost a magician. Even
great kings are trapped by her, and this young man is almost innocent.
She is not interested in giving him shelter, she has become lustful
towards his beautiful body. And you say yes?”</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha said, “You wait! We will decide who is right after four
months. Let him go and let him stay with the woman.”</p><p><br></p><p>Those four months looked very long for the other monks. It was really
difficult to wait, and they knew that Buddha was going to be proved
wrong – for four months living with that woman? She could not leave this
monk, she would seduce him; it was absolutely certain.</p><p><br></p><p>And after four months the monk came back and touched Budha’s feet.
The others said, “Now tell the</p><p>truth – what happened?”</p><p><br></p><p>And the monk said, “Just wait a few minutes, because the woman is
coming and it will be better to hear it from the horse’s mouth
herself.”</p><p>And the woman went and she touched Buddha’s feet, and she asked to be
initiated into sannyas. Buddha said, “Why?”</p><p>She said, “I tried to seduce him, but I failed. He seduced me! He
seduced me into sannyas! For four months I tried every possible way, but
he remained like a lotus leaf. I would dance naked around him and he
would meditate! I have never failed in my life, this is the first time.
For the first time I am impressed by a man, for the first time I have
encountered a man! Up to now I had seen only slaves. They may have been
great kings but they all touched the dust of my feet. This is the only
man I have seen who remained like a lotus leaf I tried every possible
way – good food, beautiful room, beautiful clothes, beautiful bed, every
possible comfort for him – and he would never say no! – but I failed. I
could not distract him. And he used to laugh at me. I would dance my
most cherished dances and I would start throwing my clothes away,
waiting, now some lust might arise in his eyes – but never!</p><p><br></p><p>He would laugh and giggle, and he would say,‘What are you doing? And
it is too cold, you may catch cold!’ He has transformed me. Now I would
like to become the same, a lotus leaf.”</p><p><br></p><p>JAISE KAMALPATRA JAL BASA, AISE TUM SAHIB HAM DASA...</p><p>You are my Master, I am your shadow; wherever you go I go. If you
take me into the world, perfectly okay. If you take me out of the world,
perfectly okay. I can only say yes. Every dance is your dance. Who am I
to say no?</p><p><br></p><p>This is the ultimate meaning of sannyas: not renunciation but
rejoicing.</p><p><br></p><p>John says in the ACTS – it is the last night before Jesus is to
depart from his disciples – “He gathered us all together, and said:
Before I am delivered up unto them let us sing a hymn to the Father, and
so go forth to that which lieth before us. He bade us therefore make as
it were a ring, holding one another’s hands, and himself standing in the
midst said: Answer Amen unto me.…</p><p><br></p><p>Glory be to thee, Father.</p><p><br></p><p>And we, going about in a ring, answered him: Amen. Glory be to thee,
Word: Glory be to thee, Grace. Amen. Glory be to thee, Spirit: Glory be
to thee,</p><p><br></p><p>Holy One. Amen.</p><p>We praise thee, O Father; we give thanks to thee, O Light, wherein
darkness dwelleth not. Amen.</p><p><br></p><p>The word ‘amen’ means, “Yes God, yes! If you want us to die, yes! If
crucifixion is your will, yes! Thy</p><p>kingdom come, thy will be done.”</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what Kabir is saying. He is saying: I am just a shadow to you.
Wherever you go I will go. I have</p><p>no desire of my own. How can I have any desire of my own? I am not,
you are. AS THE OWL OPENS HIS EYES ALL NIGHT TO THE MOON,</p><p>WE LIVE AS THE GREAT ONE AND LITTLE ONE.</p><p><br></p><p>JAISE CHAKOR TAKAT NIS CHANDA, AISE TUM SAHIB HAM BANDA...</p><p><br></p><p>CHAKOR is a poetic metaphor. CHAKOR is a water bird, not exactly an
owl; you can call him a water- owl. It is not found in the West, hence
there is no word for it in the English language. CHAKOR is a bird which
is very fascinated by the moon. When the full moon is in the sky he
cannot sleep the whole night. He goes on looking at the moon, the whole
night he is focused on the moan. It may not be exactly true, it may be
just poetically true. Maybe CHAKOR has some other reason – maybe his
neck is made in such a way that he cannot look anywhere else! But he has
become a</p><p><br></p><p>poetic metaphor of significance: that is the way the lover looks at
the beloved, the devotee looks at the deity, the disciple looks at the
Master.</p><p><br></p><p>JAISE CHAKOR TAKAT NIS CHANDA...</p><p>Just like the CHAKOR who goes on looking at the moon the whole
night... ... AISE TUM SAHIB HAM BANDA...</p><p><br></p><p>... just like that I go on looking at you.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, when you have recognized Him within you, wherever you look

it is going to go to the very end. There is no possibility of its being
annihilated; it is the eternal love.</p><p><br></p><p>God is the eternal goal. Consciously or unconsciously, we are
searching for Him. And the day we stop searching for Him we become
miserable, our life becomes darkened, we lose the star that was keeping
us moving. Our life becomes stagnant, it is no more a flow. And when
there is no God there is no glow either.</p><p><br></p><p>HERE IS KABIR’S IDEA: AS THE RIVER GIVES ITSELF INTO THE OCEAN,</p><p><br></p><p>WHAT IS INSIDE ME MOVES INSIDE YOU.</p><p><br></p><p>KAHE KABIR HAMARA MAN LAGA, JAISE SARITA SINDH SAMAI.</p><p>Just as the river moves into the ocean and becomes the ocean, exactly
like that something has happened within me.</p><p><br></p><p>KAHE KABIR HAMARA MAN LAGA, JAISE SARITA SINDH SAMAI.</p><p>My own being has disappeared, my own private existence is no more
there. I have become just a part of you, a part of the total. I have
become an organic unity with you.</p><p><br></p><p>And the moment you become an organic unity with God your life becomes
an orgasmic joy, joy and joy and joy! Your whole life becomes a sheer
blissfulness from this end to the other end.</p><p><br></p><p>Sydney Carter says:</p><p><br></p><p>They cut me down and I leap up high; I am the life that’ll never,
never die. I’ll live in you if you’ll live in me; I am the Lord of the
Dance, said he.</p><p><br></p><p>I danced in the morning when the world was begun, And I danced in the
stars and the moon and the sun,</p><p>And I came down from heaven and I danced on the earth;</p><p><br></p><p>At Bethlehem I had my birth. Dance then wherever you may be; I am the
Lord of the Dance, said he.</p><p>And I’ll lead you all, wherever you may be. I’ll</p><p><br></p><p>lead you all in the dance, said he.…</p><p><br></p><p>The invitation from God is constantly there:</p><p><br></p><p>“And I’ll lead you all wherever you may be, I’ll lead you all in the
dance, said he.”</p><p><br></p><p>Those who are ready to accept the invitation, those who are ready to
open the door when God knocks on the door, those who are ready to let
Him in, their lives become a dance, a dance of utter beauty. You can
also rejoice. You can miss if you are stubborn, if you are closed, if
you are not available.</p><p><br></p><p>You are free to be miserable, remember. Misery is your own choice.
You have chosen it that way, hence you are miserable. You can drop it

gestalt.</p><p>Don’t be a separate entity. In fact you are not; it is only an
illusion that you think that you are</p><p>separate. You are not to lose anything but your illusion of
separation, and the dance begins.</p><p><br></p><p>And unless the dance begins, life remains futile. And He is always

the day I disappeared was the greatest day. The day I died was the
beginning of real life.</p><p>One has to be ready to die, only then does eternal life become
available. It is yours, and just for the</p><p>asking. Gather courage, and don’t go on missing the dance of

VERY</p><p>STERNLY, “WHY DON’T YOU GO AWAY?</p><p>NOW WHENEVER I AM IN FRONT OF YOU, AND AT OTHER TIMES ALSO, I FEEL ME
SO STRONGLY... I WISH I WOULD GO AWAY.</p><p><br></p><p>Yoga Pratima,</p><p><br></p><p>YOU are just holding on to something which is no more there. You are
clinging to a shadow. You are. just clinging to a memory. And that is
the case with many of my sannyasins – their egos are gone, just the
traces, footprints, past memories are there. And they go on clinging to
those past memories, thinking these are their egos.</p><p>It takes time to recognize the fact that “I am no more.” Sometimes it
can take years to understand</p><p>that the ego has been left somewhere on the path long before.</p><p><br></p><p>And Pratima, about you I can say it absolutely: that it is only a
shadow that is torturing you. The ego HAS disappeared, but you have not
yet been able... alert... The ego has disappeared in deep love with
me.</p><h2 style=padding-top:4pt;padding-left:6pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=c-h-a-p-t-e-r-8-.-y-o-u-a-r-e-m-y-g-o-l-d-e-n-c-o-r-n-f-i-e-l-d>C H
A P T E R 8 . Y O U A R E M Y G O L D E N C O R N F I E L D</h2><p><br></p><p>The ego disappears in two ways. When it disappears because of
meditation one immediately becomes aware that it is gone, because
meditation means awareness and nothing else, so there is no gap. On the
path of awareness the disappearance of the ego and the recognition is
instantaneous, simultaneous.</p><p>But on the path of love ego disappears and the recognition comes only
later on. The path of love is the path of the drunkard. He is utterly
drunk, so how can he recognize what has happened or what is happening?
And when you are in love so much goes on happening that even to take
note of it all becomes more and more difficult. And when deeper things
happen, it really takes time for them to reach to your recognition.</p><p><br></p><p>Meditation is the way of the head. Recognition also is part of the
head-function, so meditation happens, immediately recognition happens.
Love happens in the heart, and there is a great distance between love
and logic, the heart and the head.</p><p>Pratima, in the heart you are no more; the head is still clinging to
an old idea. The bird has left the cage long before You are drowning in
me more and more every day.</p><p><br></p><p>Dad was pretending to be asleep. “Maybe the kids will go away” he
thought, “if I play possum.” But they persisted in their efforts to try
and rouse him from his delicious sleep. Finally his little daughter
tried to open one of his eyelids, looked intently in, and reported to
her brothers, “He is still in there!”</p><p><br></p><p>I have looked into you, Pratima, and I say you are not there. It will
be difficult to believe what I am saying, because how can you believe it
unless it becomes your own recognition? But my saying it will help; it
will help the recognition to happen sooner than otherwise. The news has
started travelling from the heart.</p><p>Physiologically the heart and the head are very close – maybe the
distance is not more than eighteen inches – but spiritually the head and
the heart, these two points, are FARTHEST apart. Even stars are closer
to you than your own heart. This is the greatest distance that exists in
existence, between the heart and the head, between love and logic,
between intuition and intellect. Recognition happens in the intellect
and love happens in the world of intuition.</p><p>And Pratima, you are in love. Your path is that of love. Don’t be
worried at all – you are gone and gone forever. You cannot return even
if you want to return. And this is so with many of my sannyasins who are
in deep love with me, who are following on the path with tremendous
drunkenness, who have abandoned themselves, whose trust is total – but
they will also need time. But who cares about the recognition? The real
thing is the realization, not the recognition!</p><p>On the path of love it is always the Master who makes the disciple
aware that “It has happened! Now don’t worry about it. It is already
dawn and the night is gone.” It is always the Master who reminds, who
helps the disciple to recognize.</p><p>But not on the path of awareness; there is no need. The disciple
himself becomes alert; alertness is. his whole work.</p><p>The second question:</p><p>OSHO, LISTENING TO YOU THIS MORNING SPEAK ON THE DIFFERENT PATHS FOR
DIFFERENT PEOPLE, IT STRUCK ME AS STRANGE THAT OTHER THE YEARS THE
ENTIRE PERSONAL COLLECTION OF MY TAPES HAS BEEN OF YOUR TALKS ON
MEDITATION, SUCH AS DHAMMAPADA, THE HEART SUTRA, YOGA SUTRAS, SHIVA
SUTRAS, HAKIM SANAI, AND THE LATEST ON ATISHA. EVEN DURING THE THREE
GREAT CELEBRATIONS AT THE ASHRAM I HAVE PREFERRED TO SIT SILENTLY RATHER
THAN TO SING AND DANCE. THOUGH NEITHER OF THESE IS DELIBERATELY DONE, IT
HAS JUST HAPPENED THIS WAY. I SOMETIMES WONDER IF I AM CAUGHT IN THE
ATTRACTION OF THE OPPOSITE. WOULD YOU PLEASE COMMENT?</p><p>Ajit Saraswati,</p><p><br></p><p>YOU are not caught in the opposite: meditation is your path,
awareness is going to be your key, the master key. Go totally with it,
and don’t be worried about the lovers. Many times many things will make
you jealous too, because those who follow the path of love, they will
dance, they will sing, they will laugh, they will celebrate. A thousand
and one flowers will bloom on their path – their eyes will sparkle, will
become candles; their lives will become more and more juicy.</p><p>On the path of awareness these things don’t happen at all. Yes, a
totally different kind of beauty happens – the beauty of the desert, the
silence of the desert. And remember, the desert also has its own beauty;
all that is needed is one who can understand that beauty. There are no
trees, no greenery, just infinite expanses of sands and sands, and the
patterns that the wind makes on the sands, and the starry night in the
desert, and the silence, UTTER silence.</p><p><br></p><p>You cannot find that silence in a garden. The birds will go on
chirping and the wind will go on blowing through the pine trees, and the
fountains and the streams; and much goes on because it is a dance. In
the desert it is all stillness. Those who can appreciate the beauty of
the garden may not be able to appreciate the beauty of the desert; those
who can feel the beauty of the desert may sometimes feel jealous of
those who are living in the gardens.</p><p>It is an ancient phenomenon: the follower on the path of awareness
has always felt suspicious; many times doubts arise in him. That’s what
is happening to Ajit. The doubt is natural because the lover shows so
many things that prove that something is happening, and the meditator
simply starts disappearing into his own being, into his own interiority.
No flower manifests, no song bursts forth; he becomes more and more
aloof, distant. Others may even start thinking that he has become sad or
serious.</p><p><br></p><p>Vivek always reminds me, “What is happening to Ajit Saraswati? Why
does he look serious? He does not even laugh at the jokes, very rarely,
and that too with effort, as if just not to feel out of company.” Vivek
reminds me because her path is of love; she cannot understand. It is
impossible for the lover to understand that there can be any beauty in
the desert, in being simply, utterly alone. But both have their own
beauties.</p><p><br></p><p>Ajit Saraswati, you need not worry, you are not attracted by the
opposite. Meditation is your path.</p><p>On the path of the lover you would feel strange, that wouldn’t suit
with you. And this is not only in</p><p><br></p><p>this life that you are following the path of meditation; for many
lives you have been following it, on and off. But this time I think it
is going to remain on! There is every possibility that this may be your
last life. Enjoy it deeply! Enjoy this stillness, silence – which MAY
appear to others as seriousness, even as sadness. Don’t be confused by
it, don’t be shaken by it.</p><p><br></p><p>The third question:</p><p><br></p><p>OSHO, WHY AM I STILL SO SCARED OF EXPOSING MYSELF?</p><p><br></p><p>Deva Gita,</p><p><br></p><p>WHO is not? To expose oneself creates great fear. It is natural,
because to expose oneself means to expose all the rubbish that you carry
in your mind, the garbage which has been piling up for centuries, for
many, many lives. To expose oneself means to expose all one’s
weaknesses, limitations, faults. To expose oneself ultimately means to
expose one’s vulnerability. Death To expose oneself means</p><p>to expose one’s emptiness.</p><p><br></p><p>Behind all this garbage of the mind and the noise of the mind there
is a dimension of utter emptiness. One is hollow without God, one is
just emptiness and nothing without God. One wants to hide this
nakedness, this emptiness, this ugliness. One covers it with beautiful
flowers, one decorates those covers. One at least pretends that one is
something, somebody. And this is not something that is personal to you;
this is universal, this is the case with everybody.</p><p>Nobody can open himself like a book. Fear grips: “What will people
think about me?” From your very childhood you have been taught to wear
masks, beautiful masks. There is no need to have a beautiful face, just
a beautiful mask will do; and the mask is cheap. To transform your face
is arduous, to paint your face is very simple.</p><p>Now suddenly to expose your real face gives you a shivering in the
deepest core of your being. A trembling arises: will people like it?
will people accept you? will people still love you, respect you? Who
knows? – because they have loved your mask, they have respected your
character, they have glorified your garments. Now the fear arises: “If I
suddenly become naked are they still going to love me, respect me,
appreciate me, or will they all escape away from me? They may turn their
backs, I may be left alone.”</p><p><br></p><p>Hence people go on pretending. Out of fear is the pretension, out of
fear arises all pseudoness. One needs to be fearless to be
authentic.</p><p>And one of the fundamental laws of life is this: whatsoever you hide
goes on growing, and whatsoever you expose, if it is wrong it
disappears, evaporates in the sun, and if it is right it is nourished.
Just the opposite happens when you hide something: the right starts
dying because it is not nourished. It needs the wind and the rain and
the sun. It needs the whole of nature available to it. It can grow only
with truth, it feeds on truth. Stop giving it its nourishment and it
starts getting thinner and thinner.</p><p><br></p><p>And people are starving their reality and fattening their unreality.
Your unreal faces feed upon lies, so you have to go on inventing more
and more lies. To support one lie you will have to lie one hundred times
more, because a lie can be supported only by bigger lies. So when you
hide behind facades the real starts dying and the unreal thrives,
becomes fatter and fatter. If you expose yourself the unreal will die,
is bound to die, because the unreal cannot remain in the open. It can
remain only in secrecy, it can remain only in darkness, it can only
remain in the tunnels of your unconscious. If you bring it to
consciousness it starts evaporating.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s the whole secret of the success of psychoanalysis. It is a
simple secret, but the WHOLE secret of psychoanalysis: the psychoanalyst
helps to bring up all that is inside your unconscious, in the darker
realms of your being, to the level of the conscious. He brings it to the
surface where you can see it, others can see it, and a miracle happens:
even your seeing it is the beginning of its death. And if you can relate
it to somebody else – that’s what you do in psychoanalysis, you expose
yourself to your psychoanalyst – even exposing to a single person is
enough to bring great changes in your being. But to expose to a
psychoanalyst is limited: you have exposed only to one person, in deep
privacy, with the condition that he is not going to make it public. That
is part of the profession of the physician, psychoanalyst, therapist,
that is part of his oath: that he will not tell it to anybody, it will
be kept secret. So it is a very limited exposure, but still it helps.
And it is a professional exposure; still it helps. It takes years,
that’s why; that which can be done within days takes years in
psychoanalysis – four years, five years – and even then psychoanalysis
is never complete. The world has not yet known a single case of total
psychoanalysis, of the process completed, terminated, finished, no, not
yet. Not even your psychoanalysts are completely psychoanalyzed –
because the exposure itself is very limited and with conditions. The
psychoanalyst listens to you as if he is not listening, because he is
not to tell it to anybody. But even then it helps, it helps tremendously
to unburden.</p><p><br></p><p>If you can expose yourself religiously – not in privacy, not to the
professional, but simply in all your relationships – that’s what sannyas
is all about. It is self-psychoanalysis. It is twenty-four hour
psychoanalysis, day in, day out. It is psychoanalysis in all kinds of
situations: with the wife, with the friend, with the relative, with the
enemy, with the stranger, with the boss, with the servant. For twenty-
four hours you are relating.</p><p>If you go on exposing yourself... In the beginning it is going to be
really very scary, but soon you will start gaining strength because once
the truth is exposed it becomes stronger and the untruth dies. And with
the truth becoming stronger you become rooted, YOU become centered. You
start becoming an individual; the personality disappears and
individuality appears.</p><p><br></p><p>Personality is bogus, individuality is substantial. Personality is
just a facade, individuality is your truth. Personality is imposed from
the outside; it is a persona, a mask. Individuality is your reality – it
is as God has made you. Personality is social sophistication, social
polishing. Individuality is raw, wild, strong, with tremendous
power.</p><p><br></p><p>Only in the beginning, Gita, will the fear be there. Hence the need
for a Master, so that in the beginning he can hold your hand, so that in
the beginning he can support you, so that in the beginning he can take
you a few steps with him. The Master is not a psychoanalyst; he is that
and far more. The psychoanalyst is a professional, the Master is not a
professional. It is not his profession to help people, it is his
vocation. It is his love, it is his compassion. And because it is his
compassion he takes you only as far as you need him. The moment he
starts feeling that you</p><p><br></p><p>can go on your own he starts slipping his hand out of your hands.
Although you would like to go on clinging, he cannot allow that.</p><p><br></p><p>Once you are ready, courageous, daring, once you have tasted the
freedom of truth, the freedom of exposing your reality, you can go on
your own. You can be a light unto yourself.</p><p>But the fear is natural because from the very childhood you have been
taught falsities, and you have become so much identified with the false
that to drop it almost looks like committing suicide. And the fear
arises because a great identity crisis arises.</p><p>For fifty years, sixty years, you have been a certain kind of person.
Now Gita must be reaching sixty. For sixty years you have been a certain
kind of person. Now at this last phase of your life, dropping that
identity and starting to learn about yourself from ABC is frightening.
Death is coming closer and closer every day – is this the time to start
a new lesson? Who knows if you will be able to complete it or not? Who
knows? You may lose your old identity and you may not have time enough,
energy enough, courage enough to attain to a new identity. So are you
going to die without an identity? Are you going to live in the last
phase of your life without an identity? That will be a kind of madness,
to live without an identity; the heart sinks, the heart shrinks. One
thinks, “Now it is okay to go on for a few days more. It is better to
live with the old, the familiar, the secure, the convenient.” You have
become skillful about it. And it has been a great investment: you have
put sixty years of your life into it. Somehow you have managed, somehow
you have created an idea of who you are, and now I tell you to drop that
idea because you are not THAT! No idea is needed to know yourself. In
fact, all ideas have to be dropped, only then can you know who you
are.</p><p><br></p><p>Fear is natural. Don’t condemn it, and don’t feel that it is
something wrong. It is just part of this whole social upbringing. We
have to accept it and go beyond it; without condemning it we have to go
beyond it.</p><p><br></p><p>Expose, slowly, slowly – there is no need to take jumps that you
cannot manage; go by steps, gradually. But soon you will learn the taste
of the truth, and you will be surprised that all those sixty years have
been a sheer wastage. Your old identity will be lost, you will have a
totally new conception. It will not really be an identity but a new
vision, a new way of seeing things, a new perspective. You will not be
able to say ‘I’ again with something behind it; you will use the word
because it is useful, but you will know all the time that the word
carries no meaning, no substance, no existential substance at all; that
behind this ‘I’ is hidden an ocean, infinite, vast, divine.</p><p>You will never attain to another identity; your old identity will be
gone, and for the first time you will start feeling yourself as a wave
in the ocean of God. That is not an identity because you are not in it.
You have disappeared, God has overwhelmed you.</p><p>If you can risk the false, the truth can be yours. And it is worth
it, because you risk only the false and you gain the truth. You risk
nothing and you gain all.</p><p><br></p><p>My work here is to somehow persuade you, seduce you this way or that,
to drop the old identity. Many, many fears will come: many things that
you have done in the past, and you have been able to hide them, and you
have succeeded. Now again opening the closed chapters for no reason at
all, the closed chambers, and releasing the ghosts of the past...</p><p><br></p><p>You may not have been faithful to your husband once in a while, but
you have been able to manage a certain face of sincerity, faithfulness.
Now unnecessarily exposing yourself is bound to create fear. You may not
have been faithful, now what is the point of exposing it? Or you may
have been faithful in action but not in thought, but what is the point
in exposing it? The mind will say, “There is no need! There are so many
problems already, why create new problems?”</p><p><br></p><p>You may have succeeded in telling many lies and circulating those
lies as true. You may have succeeded, and those lies are almost truths
for others now, and even for you. Now going back and looking again – it
is very, very natural to be afraid, not to look back, not to go into all
those nightmares.</p><p>Harry constantly irritated his friends with his eternal optimism. No
matter how bad the situation was he would always say, “It could have
been worse!”</p><p><br></p><p>To cure him of this annoying habit his friends decided to invent a
situation so completely black, so dreadful, that even Harry would find
no hope in it.</p><p>Approaching him at the club bar one day one of them said, “Harry, did
you hear what happened to George? He came home last night, found his
wife in bed with another man, shot them both, then turned the gun on
himself.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Terrible!” said Harry, “but it could have been worse.”</p><p><br></p><p>“How in hell,” asked the dumbfounded friend, “could it possibly have
been worse?” “Well,” said Harry, “if it had happened the night before, I
would be dead now!”</p><p><br></p><p>It is better to keep quiet, the mind says; it is better not to bring
all the old ghosts, not to release them. It is better to go on sitting
on them. For sixty years you have been able to manage a certain
demeanor, a certain gracefulness, a certain personality – polished,
civilized, respectable – now to suddenly expose it for no reason at all?
Have you gone mad? The mind will say you have waited so long, you can
wait a little more.</p><p><br></p><p>Little Siddhartha writes me again and again, “Osho, now I want to
become part of the ashram.” I have been telling him to just wait a
little more, a little more, a little more, but he is persistent. After
one month or two he asks for a darshan, and the only question he asks
is, “When am I going to come into the ashram?”</p><p>Three or four days ago, again he wrote a letter asking, “Now it is
time! When am I going to be in the ashram?” So I said to Laxmi, “Now
tell him within four or five days. Make any arrangement and let him come
in.”</p><p>Laxmi told him, “Just wait four or five days.” He said, “Why four or
five days? Osho always says ‘Do it now!’ Why four or five days? Why
wait? Why can’t I come right now? Osho’s insistence is always on the
right now, here!”</p><p><br></p><p>Laxmi told him that the room had to be prepared, the room had to be
painted – “You will find it very difficult right now.” So he said,
“Okay. If I can wait for so long, I can wait for four or five days
more.</p><p><br></p><p>Okay, I will wait. It is only a question of four or five days more,
so I CAN wait. And I have waited so</p><p>long.”</p><p><br></p><p>After sixty years of life the idea simply arises in the mind, “You
have waited so long, why can’t you wait for a few days more? Why create
any disturbance? Why create any ripples unnecessarily?” Things have
settled, everybody respects you – your children respect you, your
husband respects you, your society respects you. It has been a hard
struggle – it has been a struggle with the outside, it has been a
struggle with the inside. Somehow you have repressed all that is wild in
you: you have repressed sex, anger, greed, jealousy; you have repressed
all that the society condemns. You have somehow managed a beautiful
character. Now why, in the last phase of your life, expose it? For what?
What are you going to gain out of it?</p><p>Mind will give all these cunning reasonings; these are
rationalizations.</p><p><br></p><p>If you have lived for sixty years in a false way, enough is enough!
It is time now to drop that whole falsity. What can people take away
from you now? Sooner or later you will be dead, and all respect and all
character and everything will be gone; soon you will be forgotten. A few
people will remember you for a few days, then they will die; then even
your memory will be gone from the earth.</p><p><br></p><p>How many millions of people have lived on the earth? Nobody even
knows their names now. In their own time they must have bragged about
their character, personality, strength, truth, courage, religiousness,
saintliness, this and that. Now nobody even knows their names.</p><p><br></p><p>When a person dies, almost ninety-nine percent of his life
disappears; one percent lingers a little bit as memory in the few people
who had known him. Yes, they will remember him once in a while; that is
all that is left. Then THESE people will die and even that memory will
disappear. Within a few years a person disappears so totally, as if he
had never been there in the first place.</p><p>Now what have you to lose, Gita? You have nothing to lose and you
have everything to gain. You are fortunate that in the last phase of
your life you have come in contact with this energy-field. You are
fortunate that in the evening of your life a door is opening, and the
person who comes back home even in the evening should not be thought
lost.</p><p>That is a proverb in India: Even in the evening when the sun is
setting, if somebody comes back home he is not thought to be lost. He
has arrived, finally he has arrived.</p><p>Life has gone down the drain; now don’t miss this last phase. And the
last is the most important phase, because it will bring death. And if
you can die as truth you will not be born again. If you can die with all
the falsities dropped, with all false identities disconnected from you,
renounced, if you can die utterly naked before God, absolutely naked
before God like a small child before his parents, your death will be the
most beautiful experience that you have ever experienced.</p><p><br></p><p>Those who have known death, they say that life is nothing compared to
death. Life has extension – seventy years, eighty years – it is spread
out over eighty years. Hence it cannot have that intensity which death
can have, and ONLY death can have, because death happens in a split
second. Over eighty years you live and in a split second you die. Death
has intensity, not extension but intensity. It has depth.</p><p><br></p><p>Life is a long way to live – you can postpone for tomorrow and you
can live in a lukewarm way – but death is so total. If you can die
consciously... And you can die consciously only if you expose yourself
totally, so all that the unconscious is carrying is poured out, all that
the unconscious is repressing is released, so the unconscious becomes
empty and there is nothing to hide; you can expose yourself in the
moment of death totally and you can die consciously.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember, a person who has ANY repression cannot die consciously;
repression creates the unconscious. The more repressed you are the
bigger unconscious you have. What actually is the unconscious? It is
that part of your mind that you don’t want to see, it is that part of
your mind that you bypass, it is that part of your house where you never
go, the basement. You go on throwing all kinds of things in it and you
never go into it.</p><p>The unconscious is not a natural phenomenon. The more man becomes
civilized the more the unconscious becomes bigger. The uncivilized
people have very small unconscious minds. You will be surprised to know
that the aboriginals, the very primitive people who still exist in some
parts of the world... In India, in some deep forests, in the hills,
there are still people who are as primitive as you can find anywhere
else; they are at least five thousand years behind.</p><p><br></p><p>One of the most important things about these people – I have’ lived
with them – is they don’t dream. It is tremendously important. It is
very rare that a primitive dreams, because he has no unconscious. He
lives his life so naturally, so truthfully. He represses nothing. When
you don’t repress anything you cannot create dreams.</p><p><br></p><p>A dream is the boiling unconscious. The whole day you go on
repressing, and in the night, when you fall asleep – when the repressor
falls asleep – all that is repressed starts surfacing. That’s what your
dreaming is. And if your dreams are nightmares that simply means you are
REALLY repressing. Your repression is dangerous. You are repressing
neurotic things inside your unconscious, and the deeper they go the more
damage they do.</p><p>I have lived with the primitives; I have noted many things in them,
but the most important is that they don’t dream. If you ask them, “What
was your dream last night?” they say, “What dream? We slept well.” Yes,
once in a while somebody dreams, only once in a while, and the person
who dreams has a totally different kind of dream than you. His dream is
not the dream that Freud, Jung and Adler study. His dream is intuitive,
his dream is a prediction of the future, his dream is a foreshadowing of
something that is going to happen.</p><p><br></p><p>So in a primitive society the dreamer becomes the seer. He becomes
the SHAMAN; he becomes a tremendously important person because he can
dream. In a civilized society the psychoanalyst becomes very important
because he can analyze dreams, he can interpret dreams. In a primitive
society the dreamer becomes the most important person – he becomes the
religious head of the commune, because his dreams become predictions,
his dreams always prove true. He does not dream about the past because
he never represses it. If he dreams at all he dreams about the future,
that which has not happened yet and is going to happen. And his dreams
are almost always true.</p><p>Now his dreams have to be understood in a totally different way.
Modern psychoanalysis will not be able to understand his dreams; it is
too obsessed with the civilized man, his unconscious. The primitive man
has no unconscious.</p><p><br></p><p>And the same happens to a Buddha: his unconscious disappears because
he goes on exposing, pouring out whatsoever is in his being. He never
represses it, he never creates the unconscious.</p><p><br></p><p>The unconscious is a creation of civilization: the more civilized you
are the more unconscious you are. If you become absolutely civilized you
will be robots, you will be absolutely unconscious. That’s what is
happening. That calamity is happening all over the world; it has to be
stopped. And the only way to stop it is to help people to pour out their
unconscious in meditations.</p><p><br></p><p>Gita, expose yourself That will be unburdening. And I am here – don’t
be worried and don’t be afraid. I am coming with you. I will keep
company with you to the point where you don’t need me. I will only leave
you in the unknown when I see that now you can walk on your own. And
then there will be no fear.</p><p>But don’t miss this opportunity. This time, die consciously. But you
have to start right now to live consciously; only then can you die
consciously: Even if you can live consciously for a few years, that will
be enough. Even a few months or even a few days and if intensity is
great even a few minutes are enough to live consciously; then one
becomes capable of dying consciously. And to die consciously is to be
resurrected into a totally different dimension, the dimension of the
divine.</p><p><br></p><p>I would like all of my sannyasins to die so deeply that they are
never born again, so that they can disappear into the cosmos, become
part of the whole.</p><p>The fourth question:</p><p><br></p><p>OSHO, EACH MORNING AT DISCOURSE I FEEL YOU ARE BECKONING ME WITH YOUR
EYES TO WALK ACROSS THE WATER TO YOU. COURAGE ARISES AND I STEP FROM MY
BOAT. EXHILARATED, I TAKE A FEW STEPS, BUT I BECOME AFRAID AND BEGIN TO
SINK. WHAT IS THIS?</p><p>Anand Pragyan.</p><p><br></p><p>I AM certainly beckoning you continuously to come</p><p>across, but who has told you to walk on the water? Why should you
step out of your boat? Use the boat and just come across!</p><p><br></p><p>Once a man went to Ramakrishna. Ramakrishna was sitting on the bank
of the Ganges. The man was a very famous yogi of those days. He had gone
there to brag about himself – and that’s what these so- called yogis go
on doing. He said, “Ramakrishna, what are you doing sitting here? Let us
go for a walk on the Ganges.”</p><p>Ramakrishna asked him, “How many years did it take for you to walk on
water?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Eighteen years practising in the Himalayas, hard work,
fasting, yoga postures. It has been</p><p>difficult, very difficult. It was almost impossible, and many times I
wanted to drop the whole project,</p><p><br></p><p>but somehow I persisted. Now I have the SIDDHI, the power – I can
walk on the water. Can’t you walk on the water?”</p><p><br></p><p>Ramakrishna said, “I am not so foolish. When I want to go to the
other bank I give the ferryman only two paise, and that’s enough! Your
eighteen years are worth just two paise. Get lost! I am not interested
in it.”</p><p>Only fools are interested in miracles. Another story...</p><p>One day Hassan, a Sufi mystic, went to Rabiya, the great Sufi woman.
He had just learned how to walk on water, so he told Rabiya, “Let us go
and walk on water and have a little spiritual discourse, discussion.”
That spiritual discussion was just an excuse; he wanted to show Rabiya
that he could walk on the water.</p><p><br></p><p>Rabiya said, “On the water? That does not appeal to me. Let us go to
the clouds! We will sit on the</p><p>clouds and have spiritual discourse.”</p><p><br></p><p>Hassan said, “But I don’t know how to go to the clouds and sit on the
clouds.”</p><p>Rabiya said, “Neither do I! But what is the point? Why can’t we have
a religious discourse here? Why go</p><p>to the water or to the clouds?”</p><p><br></p><p>All great mystics have been against miracles, and all fools are
interested in miracles.</p><p>Pragyan, use your boat! Certainly you have to come to the other
shore, but there is no need to get out of your boat. You have
misunderstood my calling you.</p><p><br></p><p>A group of tourists were standing at a vantage point overlooking an
awesome panorama of the Grand Canyon, when one of them could be heard
saying, “You know, there is a tremendous updraught that happens here
every afternoon caused by the warm air rushing up the canyon. A person
can actually float upon it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You don’t say!” replied his friend.</p><p>“Why yes, watch this!” as he stepped from the edge of the cliff and
floated away and back easily. “Wow!” said a person standing by, “I will
try that!” And he stepped off and went plummetting to the</p><p>bottom of the Canyon out of sight.</p><p><br></p><p>Said one person to the first, “You can be really mean sometimes,
Superman.”</p><p>And I cannot be mean to you!</p><p><br></p><p>Please Pragyan, don’t get out of your boat. If you sink it is
natural, it is not your fault. That’s how it</p><p>should be. Use the boat! What is the boat made for?</p><p><br></p><p>I am not for any stupid miracles, I am totally for the natural. Use
the boat, use all natural means. God is available only through nature,
not through the cunning devices of man.</p><p><br></p><p>You say, “OSHO, EACH MORNING AT DISCOURSE I FEEL YOU ARE BECKONING ME
WITH YOUR EYES TO WALK ACROSS THE WATER TO YOU. COURAGE ARISES AND I
STEP FROM MY BOAT. EXHILARATED, I TAKE A FEW STEPS, BUT I BECOME AFRAID
AND BEGIN TO SINK. WHAT IS THIS?”</p><p>Stupidity, just pure stupidity! Next time courage arises, don’t do
it! Don’t you have oars? Use them,</p><p>use the boat.</p><p><br></p><p>There are two kinds of foolish people in the world: one, who would
not like to use the boat, who would like to walk on the water; and the
other, who will use the boat and when they have reached to the other
shore they will not leave the boat. Just out of gratitude, they will
carry the boat on their heads for their whole lives.</p><p><br></p><p>I go on beckoning you, but you have to understand rightly. Just a
little misunderstanding, just a little misinterpretation, and you will
be moving astray. That’s where I am totally different, and you can see
the difference.</p><p><br></p><p>The same story is there in Jesus: Jesus calls; he is walking on
water. I don’t know that these stories are true; these stories must have
been invented by the priests. Priests are the greatest cunning,
inventive people in the world. I cannot think that a man like Jesus can
be so mean as to walk on water. Why should he?</p><p><br></p><p>These stories have been invented to convert the foolish people,
because they are interested only in such things. But the story is that
Jesus walked on the water. Thomas saw him coming; he was sitting in the
boat. Great enthusiasm arose in him – just like you, Pragyan, great
courage – and he said, “If the Master can do it. why can’t I?” So he
asked Jesus, “Can I come and follow you?” He said, “Certainly, come and
follow me.” And Thomas walked just two, three steps, then great doubt
arose in him and he started sinking. Jesus somehow had to save him, and
told him, “Don’t be a doubting Thomas.” Since then there has been the
phrase ‘doubting Thomas’.</p><p>If I had been in Jesus’ place, in the first place I would not have
walked on water. In the second place, if</p><p>by chance I had walked, I would have stopped Thomas: “Be in the boat,
don’t be too courageous.”</p><p><br></p><p>Intelligent people are always courageous, but not vice versa;
courageous people are not necessarily intelligent. I would have told
him, “Wait! There is no need to walk on the water. Follow ME into the
dimension of the unknown, but there is no need to walk on the water;
that is not a prerequisite for it.” I would have stopped him then and
there rather than allowing him to walk a few steps and sink, and then
saving him. I would not have liked all this trouble at all.</p><p><br></p><p>So Pragyan, next time this courage hits you, wait, close your eyes,
take your oars, use the boat.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t misunderstand me. I would like you to trust, but very
intelligently. Trust is the ultimate essence of intelligence; it is not
blind faith. I am not against your doubt. You have to use your doubt in
purifying your intelligence. You have to use your doubt in sharpening
your intelligence. That is the</p><p><br></p><p>function of doubt – to sharpen intelligence. Once intelligence is
sharpened doubt disappears, trust arises. Doubt is not against trust; in
fact doubt is a servant, it serves trust.</p><p><br></p><p>So I am not here to tell you to faithfully believe in me. Trust
intelligently.</p><p>But people have their own understanding. I say one thing – they
understand something else.</p><p><br></p><p>Charlie was taking his out-of-town pal for a stroll through the city.
The friend observed a good-looking girl and asked Charlie if he knew
her.</p><p>“Yes, that is Betty – twenty dollars.” “How about that one?”</p><p><br></p><p>“That is Dolores – forty dollars.”</p><p>“Here comes one that is really first class. Do you know her?” “That
is Gloria – eighty dollars.”</p><p><br></p><p>“My God! Aren’t there any nice, respectable girls in this town?” “Of
course there are, but you couldn’t afford their price!”</p><p><br></p><p>People have their own understanding. It is not much of an
understanding, but that’s what they have got, and they go on
interpreting through it. He says, “Of course there are, but you could
not afford their rates.”</p><p>A man was discussing his problems with his next door neighbor. “That
selfish wife of mine,” he was saying, “you know what she did? She has
rationed me, cut me down to a miserable once-a-week!”</p><p>“Don’t feel too sorry for yourself,” said the next door neighbor. “I
know at least ten fellows living in our</p><p>block she has completely cut off.”</p><p><br></p><p>I am saying things which have to be meditated upon. Don’t come to
conclusions in a hasty, hurried</p><p>way, because I am saying things which are really paradoxical. This is
a paradox.</p><p><br></p><p>You have been told down the ages, “Believe, don’t doubt.” I am saying
something totally different:</p><p>doubt, and doubt totally, so that your intelligence arises. And then
trust arises of its own accord.</p><p><br></p><p>Nobody has ever said this to you, hence the world has remained blind,
hence the people have remained just sheep. It has been good – good
business for the priests, good business for the politicians, good
business for the so-called leaders – because people are at a loss, they
need leaders. In worldly matters, in other-worldly matters, they need
leaders. In worldly matters the politician becomes their leader, and in
other-worldly matters, the priest.</p><p>And the priests and the politicians have been in a conspiracy: don’t
allow people to become intelligent. Once they become intelligent they
will not need any leader and they will not need any priest. They will
learn how to walk on their own.</p><p><br></p><p>My approach is totally new: use doubt as a sharpener. I am not
against doubt, I am all for it. Doubt very scientifically. And why am I
not against doubt? – because I know if you really doubt it is bound to
make your intelligence more and more clear. It is bound to give you more
and more clarity. Belief confuses, doubt clarifies.</p><p><br></p><p>And there comes a point when doubt cannot doubt anymore. My trust in
truth is so much that I can tell you to doubt, because I know that if
you go on doubting a moment is bound to come when doubt dies of its own
accord. When you see the truth, how can doubt exist? Then trust
arises.</p><p><br></p><p>Trust is through knowing, not through believing. Don’t believe me.
Trust me certainly, but don’t believe me. And if you want to trust me
you will have to go on a long pilgrimage of doubt, of sharpening your
intelligence. That’s why I go on talking to you, creating a thousand and
one doubts in you. I don’t allow you to settle anywhere. You would like
to settle very soon, because who wants to travel for ever and ever? One
wants to make a house and settle. I say one thing one day, and just the
opposite another day. I create doubt continuously, because my trust in
truth is so tremendous that I know no doubt can disturb it. If you go on
doubting, even doubt will bring you to truth.</p><p>All doors bring you to God, even the door of doubt. Sincerity is
needed and intensity is needed and totality is needed.</p><p><br></p><p>The fifth question:</p><p>BELOVED OSHO, IN THE OLD DAYS YOU USED TO HAMMER US FIERCELY. I
REMEMBER CLUTCHING AT THE TILES OF THE FLOOR IN DESPAIR AFTER LECTURE
WHEN YOU HAD ONCE AGAIN SHOUTED AT US, “YOU STUPID DISCIPLES!” NOW YOU
COME INTO LECTURE LOOKING AROUND HAPPILY, LIKE A FARMER LOOKING ON HIS
GOLDEN CORNFIELDS. ARE YOU HAPPY WITH US?</p><p><br></p><p>Hari Chetana,</p><p><br></p><p>I absolutely happy with you. I am one of the most fortunate Masters
in the world, because a great many intelligent, alive, loving people
have gathered around me. The VERY CREAM of the modern mind has gathered
around me. I am tremendously happy, yes, just like a farmer when he
looks on his golden cornfields.</p><p><br></p><p>You are my golden cornfield. The crop is becoming more and more ripe
every day. Many are blossoming, many are coming to fruit. Many are
growing – in love, in awareness, in trust, in EVERY possible way. I am
tremendously happy that you are here with me.</p><p>It very rarely happens. Jesus was not so fortunate: he had only a few
disciples, and those too were not very intelligent people either. They
were asking REALLY stupid questions, even to the very end.</p><p><br></p><p>The night Jesus invited them to say goodbye, to dine and drink with
him and dance with him – because this was the last night, he would be
caught that night and the next day he might be killed – do you know what
the disciples were asking? One disciple asked, “Lord, now that you are
leaving</p><p><br></p><p>us, please tell us one thing. We know perfectly well that in the
kingdom of God you will be by the right side of God, you will be his
right hand. And who amongst us will be by your side? And what will be
our number and position?”</p><p><br></p><p>The Master is going to die and the disciples are talking politics! –
“Who will be the first after you, and the second, and the third?” The
Master is going to die and the disciples are feeling jealous of each
other, competitive. They are thinking of the other world also in terms
of this world. Jesus must have cried deep down in his heart.… These are
the people on whom he had wasted his life, for whom he was ready to
die.</p><p>And then he was caught, and then one disciple started following him.
Others fled! Out of the twelve, one deceived him, Judas; he sold him for
thirty silver coins.</p><p><br></p><p>When I read that the man who hanged Z. A. Bhutto of Pakistan got
twenty-five rupees for hanging him, suddenly I remembered Jesus: he was
sold for thirty rupees. The price has fallen down; now you get five
rupees less! In fact, the price has fallen too much, because thirty
rupees of pure silver in those days and twenty-five paper notes of this
day... the difference is not only of five rupees, the difference is much
more. Thirty rupees of those days must be equivalent to almost one
thousand rupees of today.</p><p><br></p><p>But what kind of humanity is this? What kind of civilization and what
progress do we go on talking about? Jesus was killed by Jews. The man
who hanged Bhutto was a Christian; in a Mohammedan country, they could
not find anybody else to hang Bhutto. A Christian! How can a Christian
do such a thing? And how can he still remain a Christian? He is a
professional. This is what they have been doing for many
generations.</p><p>One of the great Indian martyrs, Sardar Bhagat Singh, was hanged by
the father of this man. And a very strange coincidence: Bhagat Singh, a
revolutionary, one of the greatest revolutionaries that India has
produced in these hundred years, was hanged by this man’s father in the
same place where Z. A. Bhutto killed one of his enemies. Now there is no
more jail, the jail has disappeared, has been demolished. Instead of the
jail, a highway passes through the place.</p><p>Z. A. Bhutto killed one of his political opponents in the exact same
place where Bhagat Singh was once hanged. And this opponent was the man
who was the witness against Sardar Bhagat Singh, and instrumental in his
being hanged. And now Bhutto is hanged by the son of the man who hanged
Bhagat Singh.</p><p><br></p><p>History goes on spinning in a very mysterious way, weaving strange
patterns. Life certainly is more strange than fiction.</p><p><br></p><p>The night Jesus was being taken away one disciple betrayed him for
only thirty rupees. For just thirty rupees, one can sell a man like
Jesus? And seeing the danger, the remaining ten fled immediately. What
kind of disciples were they? Only one remained, and that one also was
not following Jesus but was hiding in the crowd. Just out of curiosity
he had remained. And Jesus said, “Escape, because before the sunrise,
before the cock crows, you will have betrayed me thrice!”</p><p>But the man thought in his heart, “No! Judas can betray you, others
can flee, but I am not made of</p><p>that stuff. I cannot deny you, I cannot renounce you. I will be true
to you to the very last.”</p><p><br></p><p>And it happened exactly the way Jesus had said: before the sunrise,
the man had denied him thrice, because the crowd that was taking Jesus,
making him a prisoner, became suspicious of this man many times. They
were carrying torches, and this man looked a little like a stranger.
They asked, “Who are you? Are you a follower of Jesus?” And he said,
“No.” And when he had said no thrice, Jesus looked back and he said,
“Remember, now.”</p><p><br></p><p>At the time of crucifixion not a single disciple was there, they had
all escaped.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus was not very fortunate. Buddha was far more fortunate. But I am
even more fortunate than Buddha, because Buddha had only one kind of
people around him. My disciples are multidimensional; they come from
every nook and comer of the world. This is a universal brotherhood. This
is for the first time that religion is taking off – from local
limitations, becoming airborne. This is for the first time that religion
is losing racial associations, national associations – Indian, Chinese,
Japanese, German, Hindu, Mohammedan, Christian, Buddhist. We are
creating a kind of religiousness without any name; a nameless religion
can only be true to a nameless God.</p><p>Yes, Hari Chetana, I am tremendously happy. The moment I look at you
my heart dances with immense joy. And this is only the beginning. Many,
many more are going to come, they are on the way. You are just heralding
the coming of millions more. Hence your responsibility is great, because
you will be preparing the way; the others who will come will learn from
you. The others will learn love, awareness, discipline, spontaneity,
individuality, freedom, all of these dimensions, from you.</p><p>The new commune will have at least ten thousand sannyasins resident,
and thousands and thousands will come and go. You are also fortunate
because you will be the first bricks: out of you this great temple is
going to be created, you will be in the foundation. Remember that
responsibility, and remember that such a responsibility comes only as a
benediction.</p><p><br></p><p>The last question:</p><p>OSHO, I AM SUSPICIOUS ABOUT MY FATHER. I DON’T THINK THAT HE IS MY
FATHER. CAN</p><p>YOU HELP ME GET RID OF THIS DOUBT?</p><p><br></p><p>Christopher,</p><p>THIS is a really difficult question! In the first place, it matters
not. It is irrelevant whether A is your father or B is your father. How
does it matter? Christopher is Christopher, you are that which you are.
From where your first cell came, from where, from what source, makes no
difference now.</p><p><br></p><p>Sooner or later it will be impossible to decide who is whose father,
because there are going to be just semen banks, like there are blood
banks. People will donate their semen to the banks, and the doctors will
decide the right type for a particular woman.</p><p><br></p><p>Why are you so worried about it? But such things sometimes become
obsessions. Even if you come to know, even if I say that “This man is
your father” – for example, if I say Paritosh, old Paritosh is your
father, then what? Are you going to believe me? Then you will start
doubting me, so it is better that you doubt your father! Or you may
start doubting poor Paritosh, who has nothing to do with it!</p><p><br></p><p>Only your mother can answer. Even your father cannot answer, because
even your father may not be right. Ask your mother.</p><p><br></p><p>A youngster went to his father and said, “Dad, I would like to marry
Susy.” “Don’t marry her, son,” said the old man. “When I was a kid I
sowed my wild oats, and well, you know how it is.”</p><p>About a week later the boy came to his father again and said, “Dad, I
am in love with Mildred and I want to marry her.”</p><p>The old salesman said, “She is your half-sister, son. You can’t marry
her.” “How about Mabel?” the kid asked a couple of weeks later. “She is
your half-sister too,” said dad.</p><p>The youngster, who was anxious to get married, went to his mom and
complained, “Pop says I</p><p>should not marry Susy, Mildred or Mabel because they are my
half-sisters. What do I do?”</p><p>Mom put her arms around her boy and consoled, “You can marry any one
of them you like – he is not</p><p>your father!”</p><p>So it is a very difficult thing unless your mother is truthful about
it; nobody can give you a guarantee. But I have heard about one machine
that IBM has produced. I don’t know whether it is true or not, but</p><p>you can enquire.</p><p><br></p><p>A woman, having heard how fantastic the IBM machines are, enters the
IBM saleas room to look around.</p><p>“You can ask the machine any question you like and it will give you
the correct answer,” explains the</p><p>salesman.</p><p>The woman writes the question, “Where is my father?” and puts it into
the machine. The answer comes back, “Your father is fishing off the west
coast of Florida.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ridiculous!” exclaims the woman. “My father has been dead twenty
years.”</p><p><br></p><p>“The machine never makes a mistake,” the salesman proclaims. “There
is simply a misunderstanding. Rephrase your question and ask it
again.”</p><p>The woman writes down for the machine, “Where is my mother’s
husband?”</p><p>The IBM machine answers, “He has been dead twenty years, but your
father is fishing off the west coast of Florida.”</p><p><br></p><p>But please don’t ask such questions of me, I am not an IBM machine –
neither am I your mother!</p><p><br></p><p>C H A P T E R 9</p><p><br></p><p>G o d i s b o r n a g a i n</p><p><br></p><p>4 M a y 1 9 7 9 a m i n B u d d h a H a l l</p><p><br></p><p>The first question:</p><p><br></p><p>OSHO, CAN YOU TELL ME, IF YOU KNOW, WHAT IS BEST FOR ME? IF YOU CAN,
WHAT IS?</p><p>Miguel Terc,</p><p><br></p><p>THE best thing is never to be born, but that you have already missed.
The second best thing is to die as soon as possible; that’s a little bit
difficult. I don’t mean the physical death; that is not difficult. To
commit suicide is the easiest thing in the world, the most cowardly. It
needs no guts. But to commit psychological suicide needs great courage –
to be and yet not to be, to drop the ego.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, there are a few people who even manage to do the first. Lao Tzu
must have been one of those few people who were born and yet not born,
who came into the world utterly egoless. Hence the story that Lao Tzu
lived in his mother’s womb for eighty-two years. Until he became ripe,
until he became capable of existing in the world without the ego, he
resisted the temptation to come out of the womb. He allowed himself,
permitted himself, to be born only when there was no possibility of any
ego arising. What Buddha attained under the Bodhi tree, Lao Tzu must
have attained in the mother’s womb.</p><p>Yes, there is a way to be aware even in the mother’s womb. Then a
person is born, but is born without the ego; Jesus must have come that
way. A few have managed the second too: the second means to go on dying
to all the yesterdays.</p><p><br></p><p>The ego is nothing but the cumulative effect of all the yesterdays.
If you can die to all the yesterdays, even to the moment that has passed
and is no more, you remain without the ego. You are there in utter
radiance, in great splendor, but there is no idea of ‘I’. A pure amness,
just fragrance of being, but no center... then one exists in God and God
exists in one.</p><p><br></p><p>The second is also very difficult. One needs to be so utterly alert
that the moment the moment passes by, one has slipped out of it. One
does not go on lingering with the past, one does not go on clinging to
the memories. There is no nostalgia, no looking back. It does not mean
looking ahead, because looking ahead is another way of looking back. It
does not mean beginning a life in the future, projecting a life into the
future, because the future is nothing but a reflection of the past. What
you can desire in the future is bound to be nothing but a repetition of
the past, modified, refined, more sophisticated, more polished but still
the same. But there cannot be any qualitative difference; maybe some
quantitative differences are there. The future is nothing but the
projection of the past.</p><p><br></p><p>So I am not saying drop the past so that you can live in the future.
That is the past coming back through the back door again. If you drop
the yesterdays, you will have to drop the tomorrows too. When all
yesterdays and all tomorrows have disappeared, then what is left? – this
moment, this purity, this silence, thisness! Buddha calls it TATHATA,
suchness. There is nothing else to desire, there is no should, no ought,
there is nowhere to go. One is utterly contented in this moment; one is
relaxed, calm and quiet. All desires have disappeared because they can
exist only through the past and through the future. And when there is no
desire, how can there be mind? Mind is desiring. And when there is no
mind how can there be an ego? Ego is the center of the false mind. This
is the second best.</p><p><br></p><p>The third best is to love, because love is a sweet way to die, to
disappear. The SWEETEST way to die is love. It helps you to drop the
ego, and with no effort. And it helps you to drop the ego with such
grace, with such joy, that if you cannot drop the ego through love then
it will be very difficult to drop it at all.</p><p>In love, the other is available; the other is an excuse to drop the
ego. And the beauty of the other, and the caressing warmth of the other,
the protection, the shelter! – it is easy to die because love gives one
courage, courage to do the impossible. And love gives one a kind of
drunkenness. In that drunkenness it is easy to take the jump, the
quantum leap.</p><p>Love makes one mad. That madness is higher than what you call sanity,
because your sanity remains crawling in the dark holes of the earth, and
love opens its wings towards the sun. Love dares, is adventurous. Love
is ready to die, because in love one FEELS that even if one dies, one
cannot die. Love gives the feel of immortality.</p><p>And the path of love is full of flowers – the birds are singing, and
the trees are green, and it is very sunny. The easiest is the third.</p><p><br></p><p>But for a few people it is very difficult: the very idea of drowning
oneself in the other makes them very much scared. The very presence of
the other makes them shrink in. The very presence of the other and they
become closed. If you are of that type, Miguel, then the fourth way is
for you: to meditate.</p><p><br></p><p>That too is a way of dying – a little more dry than the third, a
little more alone than the third, not so sweet, certainly, even a little
bitter... but a few people like bitter tastes – coffee, cocoa. Likes
differ, so if you like something bitter, spicy, something hard... There
are people who are intrigued only by the harder course; the easy is not
a challenge to them, the easy has no appeal for them. The harder the
task, the more they rise to it. They are challenged only by the arduous,
the difficult, the impossible; the impossible is their passion. For them
is the way of meditation. Be alone – doing nothing, sitting silently,
the spring comes and the grass grows by itself.</p><p>In love there is a song, a dialogue, a meeting, a merger. In
meditation one simply evaporates. In</p><p>one’s aloneness slowly, slowly one evaporates, and one day nothing is
found, the ego has died. These are the four possibilities.</p><p>Miguel, you ask me, “CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT IS BEST FOR ME?” These four
things.</p><p><br></p><p>But the basic note is the same, and that is: learn to die, because
that is the only way to learn to live. Let the ego die and your life
starts taking the flavor of the divine. Death becomes the door to the
divine – death of the ego.</p><p>And the fifth – which is not really the fifth but a combination of
all these four, a symphony, an orchestra – I call it sannyas. It
combines all that is beautiful in all the four, it is multi-dimensional.
All these four are one-dimensional, sannyas is multi-dimensional. It
teaches you how to be born and yet never to be born. It teaches you how
to die and yet to live immensely. It teaches you how to fall in love and
yet go on rising up. It teaches you how to disappear in love and yet
remain aloof, unpossessed, non-possessive. It teaches you how to be with
the other and yet remain free and let the other be free. It teaches you
how to meditate and be alone and yet not let your aloneness become an
escape, to be alone and yet be in the world. It teaches you how to be a
lotus leaf in the lake, in the water, and yet untouched by it.</p><p>Sannyas is the synthesis of all these four dimensions; it is the very
crescendo, the cream of them all. Many religions have concentrated on
the first, particularly the Indian religions; their emphasis is on</p><p>how not to be born. Hence in India all the religious people go on
praying, “God, help us NOT to be</p><p>born again. We don’t want to get back into this wheel of life and
death.” All Indian religions are basically rooted in one concept: how to
be free from this vicious circle of birth and death, how to go beyond
birth and death, how not to be born, how to enter into eternity and
never come back into the turmoil of time.</p><p>The Christian, the Mohammedan, the Jew – their emphasis is on the
second: to die as soon as possible, to surrender to God. Prayer is their
way. Prayer means dying, dying and disappearing as a person, becoming
part of the universal, a surrender, a trust in God. The whole emphasis
is on how to surrender your ego, sacrifice your ego, at the altar of the
divine.</p><p>The third, to love as a method of dying, has been chosen by all the
devotees of the world. The Vaishnavas in India and the Sufis of Islam
and the Hassidic mystics of Judaism have all chosen the third: love,
love intensely, love totally, love withholding nothing back and you will
attain, because love kills the ego.</p><p><br></p><p>The fourth, to be aware, to be meditative, has been chosen by
Buddhism, Jainism, Zen, Taoism.</p><p><br></p><p>My effort here, Miguel, is to create a symphony of all the religions.
Here, Sufis and Hassids and the people of Zen and Taoism are meeting and
merging. I am creating an ocean in which rivers from different
mountains, bringing different flavors, bringing different fragrances,
are meeting and merging and creating something absolutely new that has
never happened before – a universal religiousness. I don’t give it any
name.</p><p><br></p><p>Miguel, if you listen to my suggestion, become a sannyasin. And the
only way to know what it is is to be a participant.</p><p>Miguel is a journalist from South America. It will be very difficult
for him to participate; the whole training of a journalist is to
observe, to be a spectator, to watch with a critical eye, and to find
out whatsoever he can find which is negative. If he cannot find the
negative, then invent, project, because only the negative becomes news.
The positive has no news value, only the negative, only something
sensational. People are interested only in the wrong.</p><p>If you murder somebody it is news, but if you help somebody you can
go on helping your whole life; it will never become news. If you love it
is not news, but if you hate and you destroy, it becomes news. Buddhas
are really not counted in your history books.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why it still remains a problem whether men like Jesus, Buddha,
Krishna, Lao Tzu, ever existed, or whether they are only just mythology.
Nobody is suspicious about Alexander the Great, and Napoleon, and
Tamurlaine, and Genghis Khan, and Nadir Shah; nobody is suspicious about
them. They have left so many destructive proofs, you cannot deny them.
History is full of the fools; from Tamurlaine to Adolf Hitler they are
the major part of history, because they create news. History is ancient
news. That which is in the newspaper today will become part of history
tomorrow, and that which is history today had been in the news
yesterday.</p><p>But somehow the Buddhas are left out of the account. Why? What must
the reason be? The reason is that these people were not destructive:
they never killed, they never conquered, they never possessed anybody.
They lived so silently, they lived so blissfully, they never created a
ripple.</p><p>Once I was talking to the Prime Minister of India; and I asked, “What
are the qualifications? How do you choose your cabinet colleagues?”</p><p>And the Prime Minister said, “Whosoever has a nuisance value,
whosoever can create more nuisance, has to be chosen.” That is the
qualification! If he is left out of the cabinet he will create trouble.
He has to be taken into the cabinet, he has to be made a minister so he
does not create trouble.</p><p>Troublemakers become powerful. Troublemakers become heads of state,
troublemakers create news.</p><p><br></p><p>Miguel is a journalist. If his training has gone too deep it will be
really difficult for him to participate here. But there are a few things
you can know only by participation. If you don’t dance you will not know
what it is. You can see somebody else dancing, but it is one thing to
see a dancer and</p><p><br></p><p>it is totally another thing to BE a dancer. Seeing a dancer from the
outside, you are simply seeing physical gestures. Being a dancer from
the inside, you will know the real feel of it.</p><p><br></p><p>Somebody can tell you that he has a headache and you can understand
that he is in pain. But from the outside, if you have never known a
headache, will you be able to understand what exactly his agony is? You
will never be able to understand it. It is something interior; you have
to participate.</p><p>Even suffering cannot be known from the outside – suffering, which is
gross. What to say about bliss? What to say about peace, serenity? They
are the highest peaks, the Everests of human consciousness. Even dark
valleys cannot be known from the outside; you have to go into them, you
have to disappear into them.</p><p>So if you are really interested, if the question is not just for the
question’s sake, then be a participant. Fall en rapport with me. Put
your mind aside – that’s what I mean by death – put your ego aside.
Enter into this buddhafield as a small child, innocent, knowing nothing.
Function from the state of not- knowing – that’s what I mean by death –
function from the state of innocence, and tremendous are the
possibilities: you can also bloom, as other flowers are blooming in my
garden.</p><p><br></p><p>The second question:</p><p><br></p><p>OSHO, IS GOD REALLY DEAD?</p><p>Shivananda,</p><p><br></p><p>FRIEDRICH Nietzsche killed God, and Sigmund Freud buried the corpse.
God’s death is no longer</p><p>new and no longer news either. Now the new idea is that death is
God.</p><p>And that’s what I am teaching you here: forget about God; let us
learn death, the art of dying. And if</p><p>you know how to die you will know what God is.</p><p><br></p><p>The old God is certainly dead, and it is good that the old God is
dead. The old God was getting heavier and heavier on the human heart. It
was becoming like a rock. It was not helping growth, it was hindering.
The old idea was very childish. It was created by the primitive people;
it was their need, it was perfectly suitable for them.</p><p><br></p><p>Just go five thousand years back, in the days of the Vedas... and it
is cloudy, and there is thunder and lightning, and you are sitting in
your cave – with no clothes on, of course – shivering, trembling: you
will create a kind of God, the God that is born out of fear. The cave
man was constantly in fear: wild animals were roaming all around, no
security, no medicine, no protection, no shelter, no light, no fire.
Just think of the plight of that man – danger all around, insecurity,
darkness. It was natural for that man to create a God as a consolation;
it was his illusion. Hence he created a God in the heavens. If you pray
to Him He will help you, He will protect you. If you don’t pray, if you
don’t obey Him, He will punish you. That was a childish concept,
perfectly suitable for the people who created it. But then it persisted.
Times changed, caves disappeared, the whole life became totally
different. Man was more secure, more sheltered, more safe. How could he
go on carrying that old idea? Sooner or later a man was needed to
declare that THAT God was dead.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what Nietzsche did. He has done a great service to humanity;
he declared something which needed to be declared. He was a courageous
man to declare it, and he risked much because he was the first man to
declare that God is dead.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember, there were people before him who had said there was no God;
that is totally different. There has been Charavaka in India and
Epicurus in Greece, and many more all over the world, a few courageous,
intelligent people, who have always denied the existence of God. But to
deny the existence of God is one thing, and to declare that God is dead
is totally different. Hence Charavaka never went mad, Epicurus never
went mad.</p><p>Nietzsche went mad. To declare that God is dead... He was the first
man to encounter this fact – that the old God had become irrelevant and
the new was not on the horizon. The old was gone and the new had not
come – and the gap! That gap was maddening, as if somebody had taken the
earth from underneath your feet and you were falling into an abysmal
darkness. You cannot find any bottom anywhere, you go on falling and
falling.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what happened to Friedrich Nietzsche; he went mad. The day he
declared “God is dead”, the whole edifice that had been used as a
protection up to then was shattered. To say God does not exist is one
thing; then there is no question.…</p><p><br></p><p>A few people had the idea that “God is” because they felt protected
with God, and a few started feeling afraid of God because he could
punish. Those who wanted to feel more natural, rather than feeling
security in God started feeling fear – because if you are natural then
you will be in hell. Just to avoid that fear many declared that there
was no God. See the point: the person who believes in God and the person
who disbelieves in God may not be different people. Their psychologies
may be exactly the same, they may be two sides of the same coin. One
declares God is because he feels alone, afraid without him. The other
declares there is no God because with the presence of God he feels
afraid. He is there, constantly watching, and He is the judge; and he is
afraid of being judged.</p><p>Remember, those who were ascetic people, who were ready to deny their
nature, were very happy to believe in God. And the people who were more
natural, more normal, were happy to believe that there was no God. The
reason is the same: the natural person will feel afraid because the
natural person will have sex, will have anger, will have jealousy. And
God is going to punish him; if God is there then punishment is certain.
It is better to say that there is no God; at least for the time being he
can feel relieved. And the person who can repress his sex, his
jealousies, his anger, would like to declare that God is, because all
his investment is in God’s existence. God’s existence is very necessary
for his asceticsm.</p><p><br></p><p>The pathological people declare that God is and the natural people
declare that there is no God. And because natural people have been very
few – the society does not allow natural people to exist – hence the
majority declare God is. But the majority also only declare God is on
the surface; deep down they all become hypocrites, because to deny
nature is not easy, it is a rare feat. Only a few people can deny it.
Really mad, insane people are needed to deny nature.</p><p>Then what is the natural person supposed to do? – he is supposed to
become a hypocrite. He should go to the church and the temple and on the
surface, formally, declare that God is, and go on living his natural
way. He will become a dual personality.</p><p><br></p><p>Nietzsche’s declaration is very original, he is a pioneer. He said,
“God is dead” – not that God is not; God has been up to now, but now God
is no more. He took away all the shelter, security, safety. He left man
alone. And naturally he suffered, he himself went mad; he could not
tolerate the absence of God. He had declared something of immense
importance, but-it was difficult even for him to absorb it. The truth of
it was so much; he was not yet ready.</p><p><br></p><p>You ask me, Shivananda, “Is GOD REALLY DEAD?”</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, the old God is dead. The God that used to sit on a golden throne
in the seventh heaven is dead. The God that you used to believe in in
your childhood IS dead. The God of your conceptions is dead.</p><p>Recently a new jet plane was invented that goes nine hundred miles an
hour. The test pilot was testing it on the maiden flight and noticed a
button he hadn’t used before. He pressed it and the plane zoomed miles
upward at a fantastic rate.</p><p><br></p><p>He breathed in sharply and whispered, “Oh, my God!” and a voice
answered, “Yes?”</p><p>That God that used to say “Yes!” from high above is no more there.
But it is good that the old God is dead; man needs a new conception, a
new perceptivity. God will not be back, godliness will be back. God will
not come back as a person again – man has passed that phase, man has
come of age. Now we will have to think in terms of godliness, not of
God; not of personality, but of presence.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what happened to Gautam Buddha. H. G. Wells has written a
tremendously significant statement about Gautam Buddha that he was the
most godless man, and yet the most godly. Godless in the sense that he
never believed in any childish conception of God, he never believed in
God as a person. But he was the most godly; he believed in the quality
of godliness. Now in that way God will not be a father figure but an
experience of love. Now God will be synonymous with love, now God will
be synonymous with meditation, awareness. Now God need not be
worshipped. God will not be the deity in the temple any more, God will
be your inner consciousness, your inner witnessing, your subjectivity.
God will be synonymous with life itself.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, a new God is being born. He has already arrived. It will take
time for humanity to understand it.</p><p><br></p><p>Nietzsche declared, “God is dead.” I declare: God is born again! –
but certainly with a new face. Nietzsche would not be able to recognize
it. Only a man like Gautam Buddha will be able to recognize it, or a man
like Kabir, or a man like Rinzai. Only those who have loved tremendously
and meditated tremendously, only those who have died as egos, will be
able to understand this new God – not as a person but as a quality, not
as something in particular which can be pinpointed, but as something
diffused, permeating the whole of existence.</p><p><br></p><p>God is the green in the trees and the red and the gold. God is the
song of the bird. God is the white cloud floating in the sky. God is the
starry night. God is when two persons meet and hug each other. God is
when two lovers melt and merge into each other. God is in all
experiences of beauty, joy, celebration. God is in every orgasmic
experience.</p><p>Now this is a totally different conception of God: you cannot worship
it, you can experience it. You can BE it, but you cannot be the
worshipper.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why my sannyasins are not worshippers. My sannyasins are
experiencers. Their God is not something outside, their God is something
INSIDE. The inside of things is God. The inside of this whole universe
is God.</p><p><br></p><p>And if you can experience your own interiority, Shivananda, you will
know God is not dead. God cannot be dead! Yes, concepts change because
man changes, but God is eternity, God is this totality – how can God be
dead? If God is really dead then Nietzsche cannot be alive, then trees
cannot bloom any more, then the earth will not be there, then the sun
will not shine, then the stars will simply disappear. Then there will be
only darkness and emptiness.</p><p>But all is as it has always been; God as an old concept is gone.
Prepare the way for the new God to</p><p>arrive! And that’s what sannyas is all about.</p><p><br></p><p>I am not initiating you into any traditional sannyas, I am not
helping you enter into any traditional way. I don’t represent the past,
I represent the approaching dawn that is very close by. It only needs a
little love in your hearts, a little awareness in your beings, and you
will become aware.</p><p>This time God is going to be born in you. You have to be a little
more innocent, more virgin. You have to become the womb.</p><p><br></p><p>And as man grows, again and again new concepts will be coming. They
simply show the growth of man. God is always there, but we grow, our
concepts grow, our vision becomes more clear. Naturally old concepts
have to be discarded, thrown to the junkyard.</p><p>All the old Gods are dead – the Hindu Gods and the Mohammedan Gods
and the Christian Gods. All the old Gods are dead, and those who are
still worshipping in the ancient temples and mosques are simply
following a dead routine. God has disappeared from there. Now God needs
new people, new mediums to become vehicles for Him. He needs a totally
new human being, a new man.</p><p>Shivananda, become part of this great experiment! My whole experiment
is to bring the new God into the world, to help the beyond penetrate
into the earth. What Nietzsche has done has to be undone.</p><p>The third question:</p><p><br></p><p>OSHO, I LAUGHED LIKE EVERYONE ELSE WHEN YOU HUMOROUSLY REPLIED TO THE
QUESTION, “IF I SEE YOU WALKING ALONG THE ROAD, SHOULD I KILL YOU?” YET,
MY HEART EXPERIENCED FLUTTERS OF FEAR BECAUSE I PERCEIVED FANATICS IN
THIS TOWN AND ALL OVER THE WORLD WHO WOULD LIKE TO KILL YOU. I SEE SO
MANY ANGRY PEOPLE WHO DRINK THE HEMLOCK OF HATE AND SCOFF AT THE NECTAR
OF LOVE. ARE THESE FEELINGS OF FANTASY, REALITY OR PARANOIA?</p><p><br></p><p>Deva Curtis,</p><p>THE feelings that arose in your heart are not of fantasy, are not of
paranoia; they are real. There are fanatics, the world is full of them.
They would like to kill me. They killed Jesus, they killed Socrates,</p><p><br></p><p>they killed Al Hillaj Mansoor. Those same fanatics are still there,
but there is no need to be afraid of them because in a way, unknowingly,
they help the work.</p><p>Just think, if Jesus had not been killed, there would have been no
Christianity at all. It is the murderers who helped to create
Christianity. In fact, George Gurdjieff used to say humorously that it
was Jesus’ own plan – that he managed that they kill him, that he wanted
to be killed so that his message could spread. George Gurdjieff used to
say that Judas was not the enemy of Jesus; he did not betray, he simply
followed his orders. He was the most close disciple, and the most
intelligent of all Jesus’ disciples, the most educated, the most
sophisticated. Gurdjieff used to say that Jesus ORDERED Judas: “If you
really love me, and if your surrender is total, then now go and hand me
over to the enemies.”</p><p>This is a beautiful story that Gurdjieff invented; it has some truth
in it. The truth is that the people who murdered Jesus played into his
hands. He may not have planned it, but it worked out perfectly well in
his favor.</p><p>Just think: there have been many Sufi mystics of the same caliber as
Mansoor, but the world knows only Mansoor’s name, nobody else’s.
Bahauddin is not known so much, Junaid is not known so much, Hassan is
not known so much, Junon is not known so much. And they were of the same
height and the same quality, the same enlightenment. But Mansoor has
become the greatest name; without Mansoor there would be no Sufism at
all. Mansoor has become the central focus for a simple reason: he was
killed.</p><p>There were many great philosophers of the same calibre as Socrates,
but because he was poisoned his name cannot be effaced. As long as
humanity exists, as long as there will be any intelligence available
anywhere, he will be remembered. Now to look back, retrospectively, it
does not seem a bad thing that he was poisoned and killed. Anyway, he
was going to die, he was an old man; he could have lived one year, two
years, four years at the most.</p><p>The court had asked Socrates, “If you leave Athens you can save your
life, we can leave you free. But</p><p>then you will not be entitled to enter back into Athens.”</p><p>Socrates said, “No, I will not compromise just for life’s sake –
because sooner or later I am going to die, so why compromise for
something which is going to happen anyway? So how does it make any
difference? It is better to be killed than for it to be known later on
that I compromised, that I was a coward.”</p><p>The court proposed another thing; the court said, “Then one thing
more – we would like to help you in every possible way. The pressure is
much, so we have to kill you, but we can give you one more option: you
can live in Athens if you insist on living in Athens, but then stop
talking about truth.”</p><p>He said, “That is impossible. That’s my business! If I live, I will
talk about truth. Life and spreading truth are synonymous to me. What is
the point of living if I cannot even talk about truth? If I cannot
commune, if I cannot initiate people into the world of truth, what is
the point of living at all? You please kill me and be finished with the
whole thing! I am not going to compromise.”</p><p>And he did well. If he had compromised nobody would have ever heard
about him. It would have been more calculating to compromise, he could
have saved himself, but he was ready to die. He chose death. Why? –
because in a very mysterious way death becomes a seal.</p><p><br></p><p>So don’t be worried, Curtis, about those fanatics. If they kill me
they will be helping my work.</p><p><br></p><p>Death is bound to come one day, and the best way is not to die in the
bed. Almost ninety-nine percent of people do that. And people like me
have been known to find better ways of dying.</p><p>A Zen Master was dying. In the last moment he opened his eyes and
asked his disciples who had gathered – thousands of disciples; he was a
great Master – he asked, “Can somebody suggest how to die? Because
people just go on dying on the bed. I would like to try something
new!”</p><p><br></p><p>They were shocked! What kind of question was he asking? Who had ever
heard of people enquiring about how to die? People don’t even ask how to
live! People go on living without asking how to live, and here is a man
who cannot even die without asking how to die. He wants to make it a
little celebration, something special.</p><p><br></p><p>Seeing that the disciples were silent, he himself suggested, “Have
you ever heard about anybody dying in a sitting posture, Buddha – like,
in PADMASAN?”</p><p>One man said, “Yes, I know of a Zen Master who died sitting in the
lotus posture.”</p><p><br></p><p>Then the old man said, “That won’t do! If somebody has already done
it, it is not worth repeating. Have you heard of anybody dying standing,
like Mahavira?” Mahavira used to stand while meditating. That is unique,
very unique; people don’t ordinarily meditate standing. That’s why you
will find thousands of Mahavira’s statues in India standing. Of Buddha,
you will never find a single statue standing; he is always sitting. The
sitting posture has always been used as a meditation posture, but
Mahavira was of his own type.</p><p>Somebody said, “Yes, we have heard – we have not seen but we have
heard: in ancient days one</p><p>Zen Master had died standing.”</p><p><br></p><p>The old man said, “Then that won’t do. Find out something soon,
because death is coming close by! Have you ever heard,” he asked, “of
somebody dying standing on his head?”</p><p><br></p><p>Now nobody had ever heard, nobody had ever even dreamt of anybody
dying standing on his head, in</p><p>SHIRSHASAN, the headstand. They said, “No, we have not heard, we have
not even thought of it!” The old man said, “Then that’s perfectly
right!” He stood on his head.</p><p>Now it was a problem to decide whether he had died or not. And the
disciples were afraid also to disturb him now that he was standing on
his head. They tried...”breathing seems to have almost disappeared. But
how can a man go on standing on his head if he is dead? He will fall!
What to do now? And there is no precedent!” Otherwise you know what to
do when a man dies, what has to be done. But nobody had ever heard of
anybody dying standing on his head, so there was no precedent: “Now what
has to be done?”</p><p><br></p><p>Somebody remembered that he had an old sister who was a nun; she
lived in a monastery closeby;</p><p>she was older than him. So they ran and they asked the old nun. She
said. “I am coming. That old</p><p><br></p><p>fool! Is this the way to die? I will teach him a lesson! And he has
always been a nuisance, I tell you.” The old woman said, “Even in his
life he was doing eccentric things. Now is this a way to die?”</p><p><br></p><p>She was not worried about death! She came and shouted at the old man,
“This is not right! And doing</p><p>such a stupid thing, and creating trouble for your disciples! Is it
right for you? Get up and be normal!”</p><p><br></p><p>So the old man laughed, got up, lay down on the bed and he said,
“Okay, then I will die in a normal way” – and died!</p><p>Don’t take death too seriously! Nothing is serious, neither life nor
death, because nothing matters in the ultimate sense. Life and death are
just episodes in the eternity of time, just soap bubbles – life and
death both.</p><p><br></p><p>So Curtis, I can understand your apprehension, your love for me, but
don’t be worried. Neither life nor</p><p>death have any significance.</p><p><br></p><p>The only thing that is significant is: while I am here if I can
impart some truth to you, if I can impart something that I have seen, if
I can impart my perspective to you, if I can help you to see a little
bit of reality through my eyes. If I can help you just a few steps into
the unknown, then you will be able to go on your own. Everything else is
irrelevant.</p><p><br></p><p>And remember, even if I am gone and your love is immense for me, I
will go on helping you. Connections are not disconnected by death. Death
simply makes no difference for the lovers. Death does not exist for the
lovers. If you have trust, if you have love for me, death doesn’t mean
anything at all; we will go on communing the same way. Everything will
go on being the same, nothing will change at all.</p><p>The fourth question:</p><p><br></p><p>OSHO, ARE THE CHILDREN REALLY AS INTELLIGENT AS YOU SAY THEY ARE,
BEFORE THE SOCIETY STARTS DESTROYING THEM?</p><p>Dheeren,</p><p><br></p><p>A CHILD is pure intelligence because a child is yet uncontaminated. A
child is a clean slate, nothing is written on him. A child is absolute
emptiness, TABULA RASA.</p><p><br></p><p>The society will start writing immediately that you are a Christian,
Catholic, Hindu, Mohammedan, Communist. The society will immediately
start writing the Bhagavad Gita, Koran, Bible. The society cannot wait.
The society is very much afraid that if the child’s intelligence is left
intact, then he will never be a slave. He will never be a part of any
slavery, of any structure of domination. He will neither dominate nor be
dominated. He will neither possess nor be possessed. He will be pure
rebellion.</p><p><br></p><p>His innocence has to be corrupted immediately. His wings have to be
cut, he has to be given crutches to lean upon so he never learns how to
walk on his own feet, so he remains always in a kind of dependence.</p><p>First they are dependent on the parents, and parents enjoy it very
much. Whenever children are dependent parents feel very good. Their life
starts having some meaning: they know that they are helping some new
people to grow up, some beautiful people to grow up. They are not
meaningless. They have a vicarious enjoyment of being creative. It is
not true creativity, but at least they can say that they are doing
something, they are occupied. They can forget their own problems in the
anxiety of bringing up the children. And the more the children are
dependent on them, the more happy they feel. Although on the surface
they go on saying they would like their children to be independent, but
that is only on the surface. A really independent child hurts the
parents. They don’t like the independent child, because the independent
child has no need of them.</p><p>That is one of the big problems the older generation is facing today:
the new children are not dependent on them. And because they are not
dependent you cannot force things upon them, you cannot tell them what
to do and what not to do. You cannot be their masters. The old
generation is suffering very much. For the first time in human history
the old generation is feeling utterly empty, meaningless, because their
whole occupation is gone, and their joy in that they are bringing up
children is shattered. In fact they are feeling guilty, afraid, that
they may be destroying the children. Who knows? – whatsoever they are
doing may not be the right thing.</p><p>Parents destroy the intelligence of the children because that is the
only way to enslave them; then the teachers, school, college,
university.… Nobody wants a rebel, and intelligence is rebellion. Nobody
wants to be questioned, nobody wants his authority to be questioned, and
intelligence is questioning. Intelligence is pure doubt. Yes, one day
out of this pure doubt arises trust, but not AGAINST doubt; it arises
only THROUGH doubt.</p><p>Trust comes out of doubt as a child comes out of the mother’s womb.
Doubt is the mother of trust. The real trust comes only through doubt,
questioning, enquiring. And the false trust, which we know as belief,
comes by killing the doubt, by destroying questioning, by destroying all
quest, enquiry, search, by giving people ready-made truths.</p><p>The politician is not interested in children’s intelligence, because
leaders are leaders only because people are stupid. Just think: if this
country were intelligent, can you believe a man like Morarji Desai would
be the Prime Minister of the country? It would be impossible. It is
ridiculous! But people are so stupid; they will find stupid leaders.
People are so unintelligent that they will be ready to fall into the
trap of anybody who can pretend to lead them.</p><p>Children are born with pure intelligence, and we have not yet been
able to respect it. Children are the most exploited class in the world,
even more than women. After women’s lib sooner or later there is going
to be children’s lib; it is far more necessary. Man has enslaved woman,
and man and woman both have enslaved the children. And because the child
is very helpless, naturally he HAS to depend on you. It is very mean of
you to exploit the child’s helplessness. But hitherto parents have been
mean. And I am not saying that deliberately or consciously they have
been so, but almost unconsciously, not knowing what they are doing.
That’s why the world is in such a misery, the world is in such a mess.
Unconsciously, unknowingly, every generation goes on destroying the
other generation.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the first generation which is trying to escape out of the
trap and this is the beginning of a totally new history.</p><p><br></p><p>But children certainly are utterly intelligent. You just watch
children, look into their eyes, look at the way they respond.</p><p>Little Papo seemed to be enjoying himself thoroughly at the zoo with
his father. As they were looking at the lions, however, a troubled look
came over the boy’s face and his father asked him what the matter
was.</p><p>“I was just wondering daddy... in case a lion breaks loose and eats
you, what number bus do I take</p><p>home?”</p><p><br></p><p>You just watch children, be more observant.</p><p>A teacher asked her class of small children to make a crayon picture
of the Old Testament story which they like best.</p><p>One small boy depicted a man driving an old car. In the back seat
were two passengers, both scantily dressed.</p><p>“It is a nice picture,” said the teacher. “But what story does it
tell?”</p><p><br></p><p>The young artist seemed surprised at the question. “Well,” he
exclaimed. “Doesn’t it say in the Bible</p><p>that God drove Adam and Eve out of the Garden of Eden?”</p><p>No proofs are needed! You just look around – children are everywhere.
Just watch! Another story I have heard.…</p><p><br></p><p>In another school the teacher had asked the children the same
question: to make some pictures of any story that they like. And a child
made an airplane instead of a car. The airplane had four windows. From
one window God the Father was looking out, from the other, the Holy
Ghost, from the third, Jesus Christ. But the teacher was puzzled, and
the teacher asked, “These three I can understand, but who is this
fourth?”</p><p><br></p><p>And the child said, “Pontius the Pilot!”</p><p><br></p><p>But nobody watches children. In fact, everybody thinks they are just
a nuisance. They should not be heard, they should only be seen: that has
been the dictum down the ages. Who cares what they ask? Who cares what
they say? Who listens?</p><p>A child came running home panting and breathing hard, and told his
mother, “Listen to what happened! A tiger chased me from the school up
to the house! Somehow I managed; I had to run so hard!”</p><p>The mother said, “Listen, I have told you millions of times not to
exaggerate – MILLIONS OF TIMES</p><p>not to exaggerate! And here you go again! You found a tiger in the
street? Where is the tiger?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “You can look out of the window, he is standing there.” A
small dog!</p><p><br></p><p>The mother looked and said, “This is a tiger? You know perfectly well
that-this is a dog! You go up</p><p>and pray to God, and ask for forgiveness!”</p><p><br></p><p>So the child went back. After a few minutes he came back. And the
mother said, “You prayed? You asked God?”</p><p>He said, “Yes! I said,‘God forgive me! It was totally wrong of me to
think of that little dog as a tiger.’ And God said,‘Don’t be worried!
When I first saw him, I also thought that he was a tiger!“’</p><p><br></p><p>Children have IMMENSE intelligence but down the ages they have not
been allowed.</p><p><br></p><p>We have to create a new kind of education in which nothing is imposed
on the children, but where they are helped to strengthen their natural,
God-given intelligence. They are not to be stuffed with information
which is in fact almost useless. Ninety-eight percent of the information
that we go on throwing into children’s minds is just stupid, foolish.
But because of that load, that baggage, the child will never be free of
the burden.</p><p>I have been a professor in the university, and I have been a student
from primary school to university. My own observation is that
ninety-eight percent of the information that we go on throwing on
children is utterly futile; it is not needed at all. And not only is it
futile, it is harmful, positively harmful.</p><p><br></p><p>Children are to be helped to be more inventive, not repetitive which
is what our education is based on right now. Our whole educational
system is geared to repetition. If a child can repeat better than
others, then he is thought to be more intelligent. In fact he only has a
better memory, not better intelligence. It almost always happens that
the man of a very good memory may not have very good intelligence, and
vice versa.</p><p>Albert Einstein didn’t have a very good memory. Newton, Edison, and
so many more great inventors,</p><p>were really very forgetful of things.</p><p><br></p><p>Once it happened that Edison even forgot his own name. Now that
should be the last thing; can you imagine forgetting your own name? Even
in sleep people don’t forget it. If all three thousand of you go to
sleep and I suddenly come and call “Rama!” nobody else will listen, but
Rama will say, “Don’t disturb me, let me sleep! Somehow I have managed a
little bit, fighting with the mosquitoes, and now you are here, calling
me.” Nobody else will listen, but Rama, even in his sleep, knows that
this IS HIS name.</p><p><br></p><p>Edison once forgot his own name. He was standing in a queue during
the First World War days. He had gone to take his ration, and when his
number came and the man on the counter asked, “Who is Thomas Alva
Edison?” he looked here and there.</p><p>Somebody in the queue said, “If I am not wrong, I think YOU are
Thomas Alva Edison.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “You must be right! I was also a little suspicious. The name
appears to be familiar, but I</p><p>was thinking that maybe it is someone’s name that I am familiar with,
maybe some friend’s name.”</p><p><br></p><p>But our whole education system is geared around memory, not
intelligence. Stuff more and more information in the memory, make the
man a machine! Our universities are factories where men are reduced to
machines. Twenty-five years are wasted – one third of your life – in
making you a machine! And then it becomes really difficult to unwind you
again, to make you a man again.</p><p><br></p><p>That is my trouble, my work here. You come as machines, very uptight,
full of memories, information, knowledgeability, absolutely in the head,
hung-up there. You have lost all contact with your heart and your being.
To pull you down towards the heart and then towards the being is really
a difficult task.</p><p>But in a better world this will not be needed. Education should help
people to become more and more intelligent, not more and more
repetitive. Right now it is repetition: you cram whatsoever nonsense is
told to you, and then you vomit it in the examination papers – and the
better you vomit the more marks you get. There is only one thing that
you have to remember: to be exactly repetitive. Don’t add anything,
don’t delete anything, don’t be inventive, don’t be original.</p><p><br></p><p>Originality is killed, repetitiveness praised. And intelligence can
grow only in the atmosphere where originality is praised. Efficiency
should not be the goal, but originality.</p><p>It was a school in the farming district and one morning Johnny came
late.</p><p><br></p><p>“Johnny, why are you late today?” teacher asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“This morning I had to bring the bull out to the cow, teacher.”
“That’s no excuse,” said the lady. “Couldn’t your father do that?” “No
teacher,” said Johnny. “You got to have the bull.”</p><p><br></p><p>Meditate over it – you missed it! And the last question...</p><p>Right, you got it! The last question:</p><p>OSHO, WHY SHOULD THERE BE A PRESS OFFICE IN THE ASHRAM?</p><p>Puna Deva, WHY NOT?</p><p><br></p><p>You know I am an ancient Jew – I answer a question with another
question; that is an ancient Jewish habit.</p><p><br></p><p>Once Adolf Hitler asked a rabbi, “I don’t understand. Whenever
anything is asked of you Jews, why do you always answer with another
question?”</p><p>And the rabbi said, “Why not?”</p><p><br></p><p>I am a modern man – in fact a little ahead of my time! I am going to
use every possible means to spread the truth: newspapers, video, tape
recorders, films, radio, television, satellite transmission,
everything.</p><p>Buddha had to go to every village. You didn’t ask him, “Why do you go
on walking from one village to another village?” That is a primitive way
of spreading the message. For forty-two years he was travelling and
travelling. Now to do that would be foolish.</p><p><br></p><p>I can be in my room, and I can fill the whole earth with my message.
It would be very unintelligent to go on walking from one village to
another village. Buddha was helpless. If I had been there in Buddha’s
time, I would have done the same. If Buddha were here now he would do
the same.</p><p><br></p><p>The Press Office creates a question in many people’s minds. They
think truth need not be declared. It needs to be declared! Jesus said to
his disciples, “Go in every direction and shout from the housetops! Only
then will people hear, because people are deaf.”</p><p>I will not tell you to go and shout from every housetop; better means
are available. Man has invented great technology. Everybody else is
using that technology, but when it is used for truth, questions start
arising. If you use it for business, good, if you use it for politics,
good, if you use it for evil, perfectly right, but if you use it for
God, then questions start arising.</p><p>I am going to use all kinds of media.</p><p><br></p><p>A new and rather young lady teacher had joined the school and one day
she found written on the blackboard the words: “Johnny Jones is a
passionate bastard. He can kiss and cuddle better than any boy in the
class.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Who wrote this?” she demanded, and after a while, found that Johnny
Jones had written it himself. “Right,” she said, “you can stay behind
after class.”</p><p>When he eventually reappeared, several of the other boys clustered
round him and asked, “What happened, Johnny? Did she cane you?”</p><p>“Oh no, nothing like that,” replied Johnny who was rather a big boy
for his age, “but it pays to advertise.”</p><p><br></p><p>It ALWAYS pays to advertise.</p><p>And this is not a new thing either.…</p><p><br></p><p>Krishna Prem had been with Moses too! He is an ancient pilgrim, he is
not only with me for the first time.</p><p><br></p><p>Moses, standing on the shores of the Red Sea with his press agent,
announces, “I am now going to raise my hand and the sea will part so my
people can walk across safely. Then I will lower my hand and the sea
will come together again.”</p><p>Elated, Krishna Prem, his press agent, screamed, “Baby, you pull that
one off and I’ll get you two full pages in the Old Testament!”</p><p><br></p><p>C H A P T E R <span class=s6>1 0</span></p><p><br></p><p>W hy no t wa ke u p t hi s m or ni ng ?</p><p><br></p><p>5 M a y 1 9 7 9 a m i n B u d d h a H a l l</p><p>MY INSIDE, LISTEN TO ME, THE GREATEST SPIRIT, THE TEACHER, IS

Wandering, wandering,</p><p>I am Life.</p><p><br></p><p>I have no name,</p><p><br></p><p>I am as the fresh breeze of the mountains.</p><p>Truth has no name, and truth is not confined in any system of
thought. Truth is not a theory, a theology, a philosophy. Truth is the
experience of that which is. Truth is not intellectual or emotional;
truth is existential.</p><p><br></p><p>These are the three layers of human consciousness. The first is the
intellectual: it theorizes, it spins and weaves beautiful words, but
with no meaning at all. It is a very cunning part, very deceptive. It
can make you believe in words as if they have some substance. It talks
about God, truth, freedom, love, meditation, but it only talks; it is
just words and words and words. Those words are empty shells; if you
look deep down into them they are hollow.</p><p>This part goes on decorating; it uses big jargon to hide its inner
emptiness. And our whole education – social, religious, cultural –
consists only of words. It only cultivates the intellectual part of our
being, which is the most superficial. Through the intellect you cannot
reach to the divine, through the, intellect you will be lost in the
jungle of words. That’s how millions of people are lost. Between you and
God the greatest barrier is your so-called intellect. Remember, your
intellect is not intelligence. Intelligence is a totally different
matter.</p><p><br></p><p>Intellect is a pseudo coin; it pretends to be intelligence but it is
not. And because you don’t know the real you are easily deceived by the
unreal, by the pseudo. Beware of the intellectual layer of your being,
which is the most developed; that is the danger. The most superficial is
the most cultivated. The most superficial is the most nourished. From
the school to the university, the superficial is being nourished,
strengthened. And slowly, slowly you get caught up in it, you become
entrapped. Then people think about love; they don’t feel, they only
think.</p><p><br></p><p>Krishnamurti relates an incident which happened when he was
travelling in a car. The car accidentally knocked down a poor animal,
but two persons inside the car did not notice what had happened because
they were engrossed in a conversation on how to be aware!</p><p><br></p><p>This is the situation of the majority of humanity.</p><p>God is present everywhere. Wherever you turn, He is Open your eyes,
He is, close your eyes and He is</p><p>– because nothing else exists. God means isness.</p><p><br></p><p>Anything that participates in existence is divine. But you don’t see;
you go on talking about God, discussing. You have become so clever in
hair-splitting, in logic-chopping. You have become so full of rubbish,
which you call knowledge, because you can repeat the Vedas, the Koran,
the Bible, like parrots.</p><p><br></p><p>You have to be aware of this dangerous layer that surrounds you like
a hard shell.</p><p><br></p><p>Krishnamurti is right when he says, “I have no name<span class=s5></span>”</p><p><br></p><p>The word ‘God’ is not God, and the word ‘love’ is not love either. If
you become too much engrossed in the word ‘god’ you will go on missing
God forever. If you become too much intrigued by the word ‘love’ then
you can go to the library, you can consult all the books – and there are
millions written about love by people who don’t know anything about love
– you can collect great information about love, but to know about love
is not to know love. Knowing love is a totally different dimension.</p><p><br></p><p>Knowledge about love is very simple; you can become a walking
encyclopaedia. You can know all the theories of love without ever
testing any theory in your experience, without ever living a single
moment of love, without any taste of what love is.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am as the fresh breeze of the mountains<span class=s5></span>”</p><p>God is neither old nor new, or, God is the most ancient, and as fresh
as the dewdrops in the early morning sun – because only God is. God is
non-temporal; it does not belong to the dimension of time. Hence you
cannot call it old or new – it is fresh, virgin. You need not go into
the scriptures. You certainly have to go into the breeze that is passing
through the pine trees, you certainly have to go into the fragrance that
is being released by the flowers. Now...! You have to go into THIS
moment with your total being, you have to relax herenow, and all the
scriptures will be revealed to you. The Vedas and the Gitas and the
Korans will be sung in your deepest core of being. Then you will know
that all the scriptures are true; but first your own inner scripture has
to be known, understood.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have no shelter,</p><p><br></p><p>I am as the wandering waters.”</p><p><br></p><p>God is life – hence God is movement, hence God is constant change;
that is the paradox of existence. It is something that never changes and
yet constantly changes. At the innermost core everything remains the
same, but on the circumference nothing is ever the same. God is change
and no-change. God is eternity and flux.</p><p><br></p><p>If you look at the world, you look at the manifest God, which is
constant change – it is like a river moving and moving – but if you look
at the unmanifest, then God is always the same. God is both. This world
is not separate from God. You need not go in search of Him anywhere
else; He is hidden here, He is playing hide-and-seek here.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have no sanctuary Like the dark gods;</p><p><br></p><p>Nor am I in the shadow of deep temples. I have no sacred books; Nor
am I well- seasoned in tradition.”</p><p><br></p><p>Religion has nothing to do with tradition or sacred books, religion
has something to do with existential experience. Your first layer is
intellectual – that has nothing to do with religion. You have to bypass
it, you have to take a jump out of it.</p><p><br></p><p>Your second layer is emotional, the layer of feeling, where
intuitions arise, visions are revealed, dreams of the unknown descend;
where poetry is born, and the dance, and the song. It is closer to God.
The intellectual layer is perfectly good for the mundane world, for the
marketplace. It is calculation, mathematics; it can become science,
technology. It has its uses – use it, but don’t be used by it. The
second layer is closer to God; it is the layer of feeling.</p><p>The first layer is masculine, the second layer is feminine. The first
layer is aggressive, the second layer is receptive. The first layer
believes in action, the second layer is a tremendous passivity. It is
like a womb. It is an open door, it is a deep welcome. The first goes in
search for truth in a very aggressive way; it thinks in terms of
conquering.</p><p><br></p><p>Even a man like Bertrand Russell writes a book, CONQUEST OF NATURE.
Bertrand Russell remained confined to the first layer. He had the
intrinsic capacity to go far deeper into reality, but he remained
concerned with words, logic, mathematics. He thought in terms of
conquering nature: how the part could conquer the whole, how the drop
could conquer the ocean, how the leaf could conquer the tree. It is
utter nonsense! The very idea of conquest is ugly, but that’s how the
male part of your being thinks. It is aggressive, it is violent, it is
destructive, it is coercive, it is possessive, it is imperialistic.</p><p><br></p><p>The second layer is intuitive: that of feeling, that of dreaming. The
second layer is poetic, aesthetic, of deep sensitivity. It is totally
different, its approach is different – it does not analyze. The first
part believes in analysis, the second part synthesizes.</p><p>Sigmund Freud remained with the first part, Assagioli moved to the
second. Hence Sigmund Freud could create psychoanalysis, Assagioli could
introduce a totally new concept, of psychosynthesis. But Sigmund Freud
will look more scientific, obviously, more logical, rational. Assagioli
will look like a visionary, a poet, but Assagioli goes deeper.</p><p>Poetry always goes deeper than prose. Singing always goes deeper than
syllogism.</p><p><br></p><p>Become aware of the second layer in you, help it to revive. The
society has repressed it, the society does not want it to function. The
society is afraid of the second layer because the second layer is
irrational, uncontrollable, unpredictable, because the second layer
cannot be reduced to mechanical manipulations. The first layer is easily
available for the politician, for the priest to dominate. It is easily
available for the educators, the pedagogues to condition, to hypnotize.
The second is not available. The second is so deep that the hands of the
priest and the politicians and the pedagogues cannot reach to it.</p><p><br></p><p>You will have to help your second layer to become more prominent. The
emphasis has to shift from the first to the second. And the second is
not the last, the second is only the door. The third is the last.</p><p><br></p><p>The third layer is that of being.</p><p>The first is intellectual, the second is emotional, the third is
existential. With the first you think, with the second you feel, with
the third YOU ARE. With the third, thinking disappears, feeling
disappears. Only a kind of witnessing remains, a pure consciousness, an
awareness. That’s what meditation is all about.</p><p><br></p><p>All sacred scriptures are in the head, and all your rituals,
religions, are in the head. Your rituals, your religions, your
theologies, don’t even reach to the second. If you want to reach to the
second you will have to learn from the painters and the poets and the
singers, musicians, dancers. You will have to go into the world of art.
But if you want to go to the third – and without going to the third you
will never know what God is – you will have to go into a deep communion
with a Master.</p><p><br></p><p>Only a mystic can make you attuned with your own innermost being.
Only one who is in at-onement with his own being can infect you.
Religion is something like a contagious disease. It is not disease, it
is health, ultimate health, but health can become as contagious as any
illness can ever become.</p><p>Religion has to be learned only in the vicinity of a Master. It
cannot be learned from traditions, from scriptures. You will need
somebody alive so that you can be in love, somebody alive who can by his
presence trigger a process in your being. It cannot be taught, it can
only be caught.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am not in the incense</p><p><br></p><p>Mounting on high altars,</p><p>Nor in the pomp of ceremonies.</p><p><br></p><p>I am neither in the graven image,</p><p><br></p><p>Nor in the rich chant of a melodious voice. I am not bound by
theories,</p><p><br></p><p>Nor corrupted by beliefs.</p><p><br></p><p>I am not held in the bondage of religions, Nor in the pious agony of
their priests. I am not entrapped by philosophies, Nor held in the power
of their sects. I am neither low nor high,</p><p><br></p><p>I am the worshipper and the worshipped.”</p><p><br></p><p>That statement is of tremendous value: I am the worshipper and the
worshipped. You are the seeker and the sought, you are the devotee and
the deity, you are the temple and the Master of the temple. You need not
go anywhere. If you need go anywhere it is only inwards, into your own
interiority.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am neither low nor high,</p><p><br></p><p>I am the worshipper and the worshipped. I am free.</p><p>My song is the song of the river Calling for the open seas,
Wandering, wandering,</p><p>I am Life.”</p><p><br></p><p>These words as an introduction will help you to understand Kabir.
Kabir says:</p><p><br></p><p>MY INSIDE, LISTEN TO ME, THE GREATEST SPIRIT, THE TEACHER, IS
NEAR,</p><p><br></p><p>WAKE U P, WAKE U P!</p><p>The original is:</p><p><br></p><p>PARMATMA GURU NIKAT VIRAJE, JAG JAG MAN MERE.…</p><p>Your real Master, your God, is very close by. You need not go to
Kaaba or to Kashi in search of him. He is so close by that even to say
that he is close by is not right, because closeness also shows a little
distance. He is exactly you! God asleep – that’s what you are. If you
awake you need not go anywhere else.</p><p>The difference between you and a Buddha is not the difference of any
physical distance, is not the difference of any quantitative changes.
The distance is only of one thing, otherwise you are exactly the same:
you are asleep, he is awake. Open your eyes and you are a Buddha, be
awake and you are a Buddha.</p><p>PARAMATMA GURU NIKAT VIRAJE...</p><p><br></p><p>For whom are you searching? He is just within you, and He is the real
Master. The outer Master only functions as a mirror; he simply shows you
who you are. He does not impose anything upon you, he only reflects.</p><p><br></p><p>The pseudo Master imposes things upon you. He teaches you this and
that, he conditions you, makes you a Hindu or a Mohammedan or a
Christian, creates great greed in you for the other world, for heavenly
pleasures, makes you afraid of hell. He is using a very psychological
strategy.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what the most materialistic school of psychologists goes on
teaching, the school of the behaviorists – Watson, Skinner, Pavlov.
Their whole teaching is that man can be conditioned only by two things,
and those two things are fear of punishment and greed for reward –
punishment and reward. That’s how they go on working on rats, and when
they succeed in conditioning a rat they think the same can be done with
man. They don’t give you more respect than they give to the rats. And in
a way they are right; about ninety-nine percent of you they are right.
They are not right only when a person is awake; they are not right about
a Buddha. Otherwise humanity works almost like rats, there is not much
difference. The rats function through punishment and reward, and that’s
how man functions.</p><p><br></p><p>The false Master simply makes you afraid of hell, greedy for heaven,
and through this strategy he exploits you. The real Master does not make
you afraid and does not make you greedy either. Then what is the
function of a real Master?</p><p>The function of the real Master is to be a pure mirror so you can see
your own face, so that you can recognize your own face. Once you have
seen your own heart throbbing in the mirror, your own being reflected,
you will become aware of the inner Master.</p><p><br></p><p>The function of the outer Master is to make you aware of the inner
Master. Once that is done then the outer mirror is no longer needed. You
may remain grateful to it because it helped you, you may remain thankful
to it for ever and ever, but it is no longer needed. The real Master
works hard so that he is no longer needed. His success will simply make
him unneeded.</p><p><br></p><p>The false Master works in such a way that he is always needed, that
without him you cannot move a single inch. He makes you dependent on
him. He does not give you awareness, eyes to see, to function; he gives
you ready-made formulas. And of course life goes on changing, and those
formulas become out-of-date every day.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard...</p><p><br></p><p>A certain rich man was suspicious that his secretary was fooling
around. He asked her but she was</p><p>very adamant, stubborn. Not only that, she became very angry and she
said, “I am a virgin!” The boss said, “Then you produce a certificate
from a medical man.”</p><p>She managed somehow – she bribed the doctor, got a certificate that
she was a virgin, and brought the certificate to the boss. He looked at
the certificate, and then looked at the secretary and said, “But it is
dated yesterday!”</p><p><br></p><p>Twenty-four hours have passed... who knows? One can lose one’s
virginity within seconds.</p><p><br></p><p>And that’s how it happens in your life: whenever fixed, ready-made
answers are given to you, they are dated, they are always lagging
behind. If you ask me how to behave in a certain situation and I give
you a particular answer, you will always be in trouble and dependent on
me, because the same situation is never going to happen again – never
exactly the same – and the answer is never going to fit any particular
situation. You will always be a misfit. Your whole life will become a
great misery of trying to fix square pegs into round holes. Your whole
life will be a long, long story of frustration, and you will be worried
about why it is not working.</p><p><br></p><p>You can see Hindus, Mohammedans, Christians, Jains, Buddhists –
nothing seems to be working. Their lives are a proof! What more proof is
needed? What Mahavir said is now twenty-five centuries old; how can it
fit in this world? But people are still trying, they don’t take any note
that twenty-five centuries have passed.</p><p><br></p><p>Mahavir had said not to eat in the night. He was not aware that one
day there would be electricity. He had said it so that insects,
mosquitoes and anything else, are not eaten. People used to eat in the
dark; they still do in India. In villages, they eat in the dark. The
people are so poor that they cannot even afford a kerosene lamp. Mahavir
was not aware; how could he have been? But still the Jain goes on
insisting that he cannot eat in the night. Now, there is no problem at
all.</p><p>Once I was staying at the home of a very religious Jain, a very rich
man and a very beautiful man too, in Calcutta. He has an absolutely
centrally air-conditioned palace, soundproofed, but he will not eat in
the night. I said, “Why? No mosquito can enter, no insects can enter.
Why not?” Just because Mahavir had said... When people become too much
obsessed with principles, this happens.</p><p><br></p><p>The real Master never gives you principles, he gives you only
insights. He gives you understanding, not commandments. He simply makes
you more aware so whatsoever the situation is you can always respond to
the situation on your own. You need not follow a certain fixed
principle. He makes you more fluid, more flexible, because life goes on
changing and if you are very very inflexible you will suffer.</p><p>PARMATMA GURU NIKAT VIRAJE, JAG JAG MAN MERE.…</p><p>Kabir says: The only thing worth doing is to wake up my mind. The
God, the REAL guru, is inside.</p><p><br></p><p>The word ‘guru’ is untranslatable. Neither does the word ‘teacher’
nor the word ‘Master’ have that beauty. In fact, the phenomenon of the
guru is so deeply Indian that no other language of any country is
capable of translating it. It is something intrinsically Eastern. The
word ‘guru’ is made of two words, ‘gu’ and ‘ru’. ‘Gu’ means darkness,
‘ru’ means one who dispels it. Guru literally means ‘the light’. And you
have the light within you, yes! If you come across a Buddha or a Jesus
or a Krishna or a Mahavir, it will be of tremendous help to you in
finding your inner guru, because seeing Buddha, suddenly a great
enthusiasm and hope will arise in you: “If it can happen to Buddha” –
who is just like you, the same body, the same blood, bone, marrow – “if
it can happen to this man, why not to me?” The hope is the beginning.
Meeting with the Master on the outside is the beginning of a great hope,
a great aspiration.</p><p><br></p><p>And this can happen only if you meet a living Master. It cannot
happen just by reading about Buddha, because who knows whether this man
was really historical or not? And the way the story is being; told is
such that nobody can believe that he was historical.</p><p><br></p><p>The followers always go on creating more and more unnecessary stories
about their Masters. Maybe they do it with good intentions, but even
good intentions coming out of unconscious people are of no use; they are
harmful. Maybe they want to impress people so people can become more
attracted, but what really happens is just the opposite.</p><p><br></p><p>Now the Buddhist story is that when Buddha was born, the mother was
standing, was walking in a garden. Buddha was born while the mother was
walking. And not only that, the first thing that he did was that he
himself walked seven steps. The first thing the child did – he walked
seven steps! Not only that, the second thing that he did after the
seventh step was that he declared, looking at the sky, “I am the
awakened one, I am the great Buddha! Nobody has ever been like me and
nobody will ever be like me.”</p><p><br></p><p>Now these stupid stories naturally make intelligent people
suspicious. And one thing is absolutely certain: that Buddha is not like
us, so maybe, perhaps, he became enlightened, but he gives no hope to
us. Jesus is born of a virgin mother – nonsense, patent nonsense! But
how can you become enlightened? You are not born of a virgin mother.
Krishna is born as God, he is an incarnation of God; YOU are not an
incarnation of God.</p><p>Rather than these stories creating a hope in you, they create a kind
of hopelessness.</p><p><br></p><p>You need living Masters who have not yet become myths. You need
living Masters who are just like you and yet different, just like you
but with something plus, something mysterious surrounding them in every
other way the same as you, but only in one respect different: they have
a certain understanding which is missing in you, they have a certain
luminosity which is missing in you, they have a certain grace, a certain
climate which is missing with you. But in every other way they are
exactly like you: they fall ill, they need food, they become thirsty,
they are tired, they have to go to sleep; they are just exactly like you
in every possible way. Then great hope arises: maybe the ‘one plus’
thing that has happened to them is also latent in you and can become
manifest.</p><p><br></p><p>The outer Master is simply a mirror so that you can see your face, so
that you can see that you also have-the same face, the same possibility,
the same potential. And once this has settled in your heart, that “I
have also the same potential, the same seed”, a great journey has
started. You will never be the same again. Looking into the eyes of a
living Master, something synchronizes in you, something is triggered in
your being, a process has already started.</p><p><br></p><p>MY INSIDE, LISTEN TO ME, THE GREATEST SPIRIT, THE TEACHER, IS
NEAR,</p><p>WAKE U P, WAKE U P!</p><p><br></p><p>But we have been asleep so long, for millions of years, for millions
of lives, that sleep has become a deep-rooted habit, almost our nature.
So it is possible that you may even be with a living Master and</p><p><br></p><p>miss, because the mind goes on creating new ways to go on sleeping,
new rationalizations. The mind will say, “Now I have found the guru, I
have found the Master. Now what more is needed? It is enough. Now by his
blessings I will become enlightened one day.”</p><p><br></p><p>Now this is a trick of the mind. Blessings are of immense help, but
only blessings will not make you enlightened. Otherwise one Master would
make the whole earth enlightened, because his heart is not miserly about
blessings. He can bless the whole world – he blesses the whole world –
but just his blessings won’t do.</p><p><br></p><p>But the mind can give you these ideas – that there is no need for you
to wake up. The mind always thinks in its own old patterns.</p><p>A teacher was checking her children’s knowledge of proverbs.</p><p><br></p><p>“Cleanliness is next to what?” she asked. “Impossible!” a small boy
replied with great feeling.</p><p><br></p><p>Now the boy knows that the most difficult thing is cleanliness, just
next to impossible. His response comes out of his experience.</p><p><br></p><p>When you are with a living Master your responses are bound to come
from your own experience. There is every possibility you may distort.
The Master may mirror your real face, but you may close your eyes, you
may start dreaming about your face, you may project something else.</p><p><br></p><p>“What did you learn in school today?” a mother asked her young
son.</p><p>He replied, “We learned that one and one, the son of a bitch makes
two. Two and two, the son of a</p><p>bitch makes four. Four and four, the son of a bitch makes eight.”</p><p><br></p><p>The mother was shocked. She went to school and complained to the
teacher, “How could you teach your class such a terrible thing?”</p><p>“Madam,” said the teacher, “I taught them ‘one and one, the sum of
which makes two’.”</p><p><br></p><p>The real Master can also be misunderstood, misinterpreted. He may
reflect your face, but you may go on seeing something else. You have
been asleep so long that you will need to be shocked again and
again.</p><p><br></p><p>Hence a constant companionship with the Master is needed; it can’t be
a hit-and-run affair. A few people come here and they say, “We have come
here for three days. Is something possible?” They don’t see the
absurdity of it. They don’t see how long they have been asleep; they
want to be awakened within three days. In fact, by the way they say that
they are here for three days, it seems as if they are obliging me by
being here for three days. Even if in three lives you become awakened,
that would be too early.</p><p><br></p><p>And yes, still I say it can happen in a single moment – it depends on
you.</p><p>The story is that two soldiers, utterly drunk, met in a training
camp. “Where you from?” inquired one.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mobile, Alabama!” replied the second.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mobile?” exclaimed the first. “Why, I am from Mobile!” “What street
do you live on in Mobile?” asked the second. “Main Street and Elm
Avenue,” replied the first.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s where I live too!” said the second southern lad. “I live at
1195 Main Street.” “Me too. Say, are you married?” asked the first
soldier.</p><p>“Sure am,” replied the other. “Married a gal whose name was Daisy
MacLee.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So did I!” ejaculated the first soldier. Then he paused for a
moment. “Hey,” he drawled, “you reckon</p><p>that we could be husbands-in-law?”</p><p><br></p><p>The fact is that there were not two soldiers, only one was standing
before a mirror. But when you are utterly drunk everything is possible.
When you are utterly drunk, it takes constant hammering from the Master.
And the truth is not far away...</p><p>MY INSIDE, LISTEN TO ME, THE GREATEST SPIRIT, THE TEACHER, IS
NEAR,</p><p><br></p><p>WAKE U P, WAKE U P! RUN TO HIS FEET –</p><p>HE IS STANDING CLOSE TO YOUR HEAD RIGHT NOW.</p><p><br></p><p>The original is:</p><p><br></p><p>DHAYA KE PITAM CHARANAN LAGE, SAI KHADA SIR TERE.…</p><p><br></p><p>The original has some beauty in it:</p><p><br></p><p>DHAYA KE PITAM CHARANAN LAGE...</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t waste time, not even a single moment. Run, fall at the feet of
the beloved. He has been standing there for so long, waiting and waiting
for you. For lives and lives God has been waiting for you; His patience
is infinite. There are only two things that are infinite: God’s patience
and man’s stupidity!</p><p><br></p><p>If you are fortunate enough to be in the presence of a Master, look
into his eyes and RUSH inwards.</p><p>Don’t waste time!</p><p><br></p><p>DHAYA KE PITAM CHARANAN LAGE...</p><p><br></p><p>The beloved is within you, the worshipper is the worshipped. The
beloved is within you; you just need to go to the very core of your
being. Descend from the head to the heart, and from the heart to the
being. Move from thinking to feeling and from feeling to being. Just be!
and that is the meeting with the beloved. And the meeting has already
been happening, you are just not aware, you are just unconscious.</p><p><br></p><p>RUN TO HIS FEET –</p><p><br></p><p>HE IS STANDING CLOSE TO YOUR HEAD RIGHT NOW.</p><p>And without finding Him you will remain dissatisfied, discontented.
Whatsoever you do, everything is doomed to fail. Except God, nothing
succeeds. They say, “Nothing succeeds like success,” and I say to you:
Nothing fails like success. Once you succeed in your so-called worldly
matters – money, power, prestige, respectability – then you will know
that all has failed. The money is there and so is your inner poverty; it
has not changed even an iota. In fact because of the richness now you
will become more and more aware of your inner poverty; in contrast, you
will be able to see it more.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why poor people look a little more satisfied than the rich –
not that the poor people are satisfied, not that poverty has something
spiritual about it, not that poverty has to be preached. Enough of all
those stupid things that have been told to people down the ages! But the
poor person looks a little satisfied for a totally different reason. The
reason is, he has nothing to compare himself with, he has no contrast.
He is a white line drawn on a white board. The rich man is a white line
drawn on a blackboard... the contrast.</p><p><br></p><p>The richer a country gets, the more frustrated it becomes. Indians
brag very much; they think their satisfaction, their so-called
contentment, has something to do with spirituality. It has nothing to do
with spirituality at all! It is a simple psychological fact: you are so
poor you cannot afford even to be discontented. Only rich people can
afford to be discontented. Only rich people really become aware of
discontentment.</p><p><br></p><p>But one thing is certain: whatsoever you attain – you can become
rich, you can become respectable, you can become virtuous, you can
become a so-called saint, a mahatma, worshipped by thousands of people –
but if you have not attained the inner beloved you will remain poor, you
will remain in misery deep down, you will remain in darkness.</p><p><br></p><p>No one is ever satisfied. Poor men wish they were rich, rich men wish
they were handsome, bachelors wish they were married, and married men
wish they were dead, and so on and so forth, it goes and it goes.…</p><p>Have you ever come across a person who is really contented? If you
come across a person who is really contented, then be with him, then
imbibe as much of the vibes of his being as possible, because that is
the only way to find your inner beloved. The person who is contented
must have found him.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddhas are surrounded by tremendous contentment, a great silence,
almost tangible; you can.touch it, you can feel its texture. Buddhas are
surrounded by great grace; if you are not closed you will be overwhelmed
by it. Buddhas are just pure love; if your hearts are open and beating,
if you</p><p><br></p><p>are still alive, then IMMEDIATELY a great dance will arise in your
being. You will start celebrating IMMEDIATELY, because seeing the Buddha
you will become immediately aware of the inner Buddha that has been
asleep so long. But so what? Even if you have been asleep for millions
of lives it makes no difference, you can wake up right now, this very
moment.</p><p><br></p><p>YOU HAVE SLEPT FOR MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF YEARS</p><p><br></p><p>– says Kabir –</p><p><br></p><p>WHY NOT WAKE UP THIS MORNING? JUGAN JUGAN TOHI SOBAT BITA AJAHU NA
JAG SABERE?...</p><p><br></p><p>... Don’t be foolish any more! The time has come, THIS IS the
time!</p><p><br></p><p>Buddhas always speak of this moment. AJAHU NA JAG SABERE?...</p><p>... The morning has come. THIS is the morning for which you have been
waiting for so long, THIS is the moment! Buddhas know only one time,
that is now, and only one place, that is here. Their time is always now
and their space is always here. They don’t talk about the yesterdays and
they don’t talk about the tomorrows.</p><p>AJAHU NA JAG SABERE?...</p><p><br></p><p>... The morning has come, and you are still asleep? Are you not going
to wake up? Are you not going to wake up and see the sun rising? You
have missed so long, so long, but forget all about it; you can still
wake up, it is still early. Whenever you wake up, it is early.…</p><p><br></p><p>But the weight of the old habits is not easy to throw away. You
listen, you may even feel a little understanding arising, but still your
investment is in the sleep. You have been dreaming such beautiful dreams
in your sleep, and now suddenly Kabir comes, and he says, “Wake up!” You
would like to awake, but not right now – and the insistence of the
Masters is RIGHT NOW. They don’t want to wait, they start shaking you.
You feel angry, naturally. All the great Buddhas of the world have
created great anger in people against them for a simple reason: they
disturb your sleep, and who wants to be disturbed? and particularly in
the early morning when it is cold, and you would like to have a turnover
and pull the blanket and tuck yourself in again just a little more, and
you are having such a beautiful dream. Particularly in the early
morning, people have beautiful dreams. You have become the president of
America or something, and here comes Kabir and says, “Wake up!”</p><p>AJAHU NA JAG SABERE?...</p><p><br></p><p>... The morning has come. And what are you doing here? You would like
to tell him, “Shut up! Is</p><p>this the moment to wake me up? It has been a hard, hard struggle for
me to become the president</p><p><br></p><p>of America. Somehow I have managed, now here you come. Where had you
been before?” The</p><p>weight of the dreams, of the sleep, of all the investments is
great.</p><p><br></p><p>A man arrived at the Pearly Gates, and on being asked his name
replied, “Charlie Graball.”</p><p>“I don’t think we have any notice of your coming,” he was informed.
“What was your occupation in earthly life?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Scrap metal merchant,” the visitor said. “Oh,” said the angel, “I
will go and enquire.”</p><p><br></p><p>When he returned Charlie Graball had disappeared. So had the Pearly
Gates.</p><p>Old habits...! A scrap metal merchant... even at the gate of heaven!
Who cares about heaven? When you can escape with the gate, who bothers
about heaven?</p><p><br></p><p>And this is the reason why people go on finding new excuses to go on
sleeping. You cannot believe how much you have invested in your sleep.
And the most cunning thing that the mind can do is to make you convinced
that you are not asleep at all, that you are already awake: “Kabir must
be talking to somebody else.”</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what happens when I am talking here – you always think that I
must be talking about other people. I am talking about you! Sometimes it
happens that when I go on Looking for two, three seconds at one person,
he starts looking here and there: I must be looking at somebody else –
because nobody can think that he is Charlie Graball, no. It is always
somebody else. This is one of the MOST powerful strategies of the mind
to keep you asleep.</p><p>Gurdjieff used to tell a story again and again:</p><p><br></p><p>There was once a magician who had many sheep. Every day one fat sheep
was to be killed for him, and of course – sheep are not so foolish as
man! – they became alert. One thing was certain, that everybody was to
be killed one day or other. They started escaping into the hills, into
the forest. The magician was at a loss as to what to do; the sheep were
becoming aware about their destiny.</p><p>Then he invented a strategy: he gathered all the sheep, hypnotized
them, and told every sheep different things. For example, he told a few,
“You are exceptional, you are not ordinary. What happens to others is
never going to happen to you.” Since that day those sheep stopped
escaping. You could have killed another sheep in front of them, but they
were not afraid any more because they knew they were exceptional.</p><p>Just watch your mind deep down – you all have that idea, that “I am
exceptional.”</p><p><br></p><p>One Arabian proverb says that when God creates a man and sends him
into the world, before He drops him, He always whispers one thing in his
ear: “You are unique, exceptional.” He goes on playing that joke, and
every person carries that deep down in his heart, that “I am
exceptional.” That’s why you go on seeing people dying, but you never
think, “I am going to die.” It is always somebody else who dies, it is
never I– “I am exceptional.”</p><p><br></p><h2 style=padding-left:6pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=to-a-few-other-sheep-that-he-hypnotized-he-told-you-are-lions-you-are-not-sheep-at-all.-and>.
. . <span class=p>To a few other sheep that he hypnotized, he told,
“You are lions, you are not sheep at all.” And</span></h2><p>since that day they stopped escaping; they started roaring like
lions.</p><p><br></p><p>To a few other sheep he told, “You are not sheep, you are men. You
are here to keep all the other sheep imprisoned. You are to help me, you
are my friends.” Since that day those sheep became detectives against
their own friends. They would inform the magician that a certain sheep
was trying to escape.</p><p>To a few others he even told, “You are magicians – not only men but
magicians. You can do miracles!</p><p>You are immortal!”</p><p><br></p><p>Once he had done these strategies no sheep were escaping, and every
day they were butchered.</p><p><br></p><p>And every day YOU are butchered. Every day somebody dies, somebody is
killed, somebody is murdered, somebody commits suicide. Every day it is
going on, but somehow, deep down, you go on believing you are
exceptional. When somebody goes mad you think, “Poor fellow.” You don’t
think that you can also go mad... because the difference between you and
mad people is not much; it is very nominal, very minimal, only of
degrees. Maybe you are at ninety-nine degrees and he is at a hundred and
one; just one degree more and you cross the boundary, and you are mad.
Just one day before that other person was also as normal as you are –
now he is mad. Today you are normal, tomorrow you can be mad. But in our
deep sleep we have auto-hypnotized ourselves. This auto-hypnosis is what
is meant by sleep, metaphysical sleep.</p><p><br></p><p>JUGAN JUGAN TOHI SOBAT BITA, AJAHU NA JAG SABERE?...</p><p><br></p><p>... How long have you remained auto-hypnotized, in a deep
metaphysical slumber? And the dawn</p><p>has come. Now wake up! It is time! Now don’t postpone any more, you
have postponed enough.</p><p><br></p><p>WHY NOT WAKE UP THIS MORNING?</p><p><br></p><p>THERE IS A FLAG NO ONE SEES BLOWING IN THE ‘GAGAN,’</p><p><br></p><p>IN THE SKY-TEMPLE.</p><p><br></p><p>A BLUE CLOTH HAS BEEN STRETCHED UP,</p><p><br></p><p>IT IS DECORATED WITH THE MOON AND MANY JEWELS. GAGAN MATH GAIB NISAN
URE</p><p><br></p><p>CHANDRAHAR CHANDVA JAHAN TANGE, MUKATA-MANIK MARHE...</p><p><br></p><p>... If you wake up, you will be surprised that you are living in such
a tremendously beautiful world. But how can you know the beauty of it if
you are asleep? You are not aware of the splendor that is showering all
around. You are not aware of the glories of life, of the benediction
that life is. How</p><p><br></p><p>can you be aware of it? You are so deeply asleep, you are dreaming
your private dreams, utterly unaware that the whole existence is a
constant celebration.</p><p><br></p><p>THERE IS A FLAG NO ONE SEES BLOWING IN THE SKY-TEMPLE. A BLUE CLOTH
HAS BEEN STRETCHED UP, IT IS DECORATED WITH THE MOON AND MANY
JEWELS.</p><p>It is a very mysterious existence. You cannot conceive more mystery,
more miracles, more splendor, more beauty. It is the ultimate in all
that one can imagine, but we are missing it. It is like a man who is
asleep in the garden and cannot see the rose blooming and cannot hear
the distant call of a lonely bird, and cannot see a bird on the wing,
cannot see the sun and the moon and the stars. He is fast asleep. The
fragrance from the roses comes to his nostrils but he cannot be aware of
it; the fragrance of the wet earth, but he is unaware; the dewdrops
shining like pearls in the morning sun, but he is unaware of it, he is
fast asleep. This is our situation.</p><p><br></p><p>WHY NOT WAKE UP THIS MORNING? AJAHU NA JAG SABERE?...</p><p><br></p><p>... The morning is knocking on the door, the sun is rising, the call
has come, and you go on sleeping?</p><p><br></p><p>This is the Master’s work: to go on hammering his disciples, to go on
hammering; in some moment maybe... the disciple will wake up. There are
moments when you are more vulnerable; there are moments when you are
very hard, impossible to penetrate. There are moments when you are more
flexible, more feminine. Hence the Master goes on hammering every day.
He goes on, without taking any note of whether you listen or not. He
knows one thing: that ultimately everybody has to listen. Finally,
everybody HAS to listen.</p><p>THE SUN AND THE MOON CAN BE SEEN IN THAT PLACE;</p><p><br></p><p>WHEN LOOKING AT THAT, BRING YOUR MIND DOWN TO SILENCE. MAHIMA TASU
DEKH MAN THIR KAR, RAVI-SASI JOT JARE.</p><p>Says Kabir: If you can do only one thing, if you can attain to
silence, you will know the splendor of God.</p><p><br></p><p>MAHIMA TASU DEKH...</p><p>You can see that splendor, you can see that infinite beauty. That joy
is yours. Just do one thing: become silent. It is another way of saying
wake up – because the mind remains asleep because of so many thoughts.
Sleep simply means a continuous thought process inside you, a procession
of thoughts, a continuous traffic. And it is always rush hour there: day
in, day out, thousands of thoughts and desires and imaginations and
projections and memories go on rushing in a crowd. You are always
surrounded by a big crowd; this is your sleep.</p><p><br></p><p>This inner talk has to stop. You can call it being awake, you can
call it. being silent – it is the same thing. To be silent is the way to
be awake, or, to be awake is the way to be silent; both methods have
been used.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha uses the method of being silent so that you can be aware.
Krishnamurti uses the method of being aware so that you can be silent.
They both are two aspects of the same coin; if you have one you will
have the other automatically.</p><p><br></p><p>MAHIMA TASU DEKH MAN THIR KAR..</p><p>... Stop this constant traffic of the mind, stop this thought
process. Then you can see the infinite beauty.</p><p><br></p><p>... RAVI-SASI JOT JARE...</p><p>... You will see the sun and the moon and the stars inside yourself
The whole sky is yours. Even the sky is not the limit – you are all. If
you are ready to die as a drop you will become the ocean.</p><p>I WILL TELL YOU THE TRUTH:</p><p><br></p><p>THE MAN WHO HAS DRUNK FROM THAT LIQUID WANDERS AROUND LIKE SOMEONE
INSANE.</p><p>This world is almost a madhouse. To be sane here will look like
becoming insane.</p><p><br></p><p>H.G. Wells has written a story:</p><p><br></p><p>There is a valley somewhere in Mexico where a small tribe lives,
hidden deep in the mountains. They are all blind. A fly is found in that
valley; once a person is bitten by that fly he becomes blind. Every
child is born with eyes, but it is difficult to avoid that fly. It is
very common, every house is full of those flies. So one day, two days,
three days, at the most a week or two weeks; if a child is very
fortunate then one month, two months, three months, but sooner or later
he is going to be bitten by the fly and he will become blind. By the
time he becomes a little conscious he finds himself blind. So the whole
community is blind.</p><p><br></p><p>A man comes from another community to visit, to see. He had heard
rumors. He could not believe that the whole community was blind. He saw,
but he could not believe his eyes. He fell in love with a blind girl of
that community, but the community wouldn’t allow them to be married
because it had never happened, there was no precedent. And they could
not believe that he had eyes, and of course they were in the majority.
They thought he was mad. Nobody had ever heard about eyes – what was he
talking about? Rainbows and colors and the sun and moon... he must be
mad, utterly mad! Who had ever heard about these things?</p><p>But he was in such love, and the girl was in such love, that finally
the community conceded, but with a condition. They said, “We have never
married our girls to another community, never before. This is happening
for the first time. We will allow you to marry our girl, but with a
condition: we will have to</p><p><br></p><p>destroy your so-called eyes. We cannot allow our girl to be married
to a madman. If you are ready to</p><p>be blind, as you think we are, then only can you marry the girl.”</p><p><br></p><p>Their logic was right – if they had never heard of anybody having
eyes, how could they believe? Kahlil Gibran also writes a similar
story:</p><p><br></p><p>A magician came into the town, chanted a few mantras, threw something
into the well of the town,</p><p>and said, “Whosoever will drink the water of this well will go
mad.”</p><p><br></p><p>Now there were only two wells in the town: one was for the common
people and one was inside the palace for the king and the queen and his
ministers. Of course by the evening the whole town became mad; they had
to drink the water. The king was very happy, the queen was very happy,
that they had a special well. Otherwise they would also have gone
mad.</p><p>But by the evening their happiness started disappearing. In fact they
became very much frightened and scared, because a rumor went around the
town that “Our king has gone mad.” The king’s guards, the policemen, the
army, everybody had gone mad. But now they were the majority. Only the
king and the queen and his prime minister, these three persons were
left. Now it was very dangerous; there was no protection and the whole
town was convinced that these three people had gone mad. The king asked
the old prime minister, “Now what to do?”</p><p>He said, “I will keep these people engaged, I will talk to them. You
and your wife go out through the back door and drink from that well, and
later on I will go and drink. This is the only way.”</p><p><br></p><p>The king and the queen went through the back door, they drank from
the well. Of course then they didn’t come through the back door, they
went dancing to the front door. The people had never seen them in such a
state; they were rejoiced! That night there was a great celebration in
the town. They thanked God, that “Our queen and our king are again
sane.”</p><p><br></p><p>This is the situation: the whole world is insane, hence the man of
God LOOKS insane. The whole world is neurotic; not to be neurotic here,
just to be healthy and whole, is very dangerous. Hence you crucify
Jesus, you kill Mansoor. That’s why thousands of people are against me:
for the simple reason that they ARE neurotic – but they are in the
majority. They have drunk from the well, the contaminated well; now
anybody who is not mad like them is a danger to their security, is a
danger to their sanity, is a question mark. His presence is irritating,
he has to be destroyed.</p><p><br></p><p>Kabir says:</p><p><br></p><p>I WILL TELL YOU THE TRUTH.</p><p><br></p><p>I will not tell you to wake up without telling the truth. He is
saying, “Let me tell you the truth: if you decide to wake up one thing
is certain – you will be thought mad. You have to take that risk.
Otherwise go on sleeping, go on dreaming, remain part of the mad crowd.
Please don’t blame me later on.”</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why Kabir says:</p><p><br></p><p>I WILL TELL YOU THE TRUTH.</p><p><br></p><p>If you decide to wake up... Maybe listening to Kabir or to Buddha or
to me, you start deciding to wake up. The truth has to be told
beforehand, before you decide to wake up.</p><p>THE MAN WHO HAS DRUNK FROM THAT LIQUID WANDERS AROUND LIKE SOMEONE
INSANE.</p><p><br></p><p>You have to risk your so-called sanity. It is insanity! but you will
have to risk it, and you will have to be ready to accept the world of
the few sanest people. But they are very few – Mansoor and Jesus and
Buddha and Kabir and Farid and Nanak. They are very few, they can be
counted on the fingers. If you</p><p>wake up you will become part of that small, fortunate minority, but
you will be thought insane by the people.</p><p>KAHE KABIR PIYE JOI JAN, MANA FIRAT MARE.</p><p><br></p><p>Not only that you will live like a madman in the world, you will also
die like a madman. But it is worth it; the risk is worth taking. It is
better to be mad like Kabir than to be sane like Morarji Desai. It is
better to be mad like Jesus than to be sane like Pontius Pilate. It is a
great decision; guts are needed, great courage is needed.</p><p><br></p><p>Sannyas – initiation into the world of truth – is not for the
cowards. Cowards can go on rationalizing, cowards can go on sleeping,
dreaming. Cowards can even start dreaming that they are awake, but they
will not risk. They will remain part of the mob, of the insane crowd.
And of course their lives will remain of misery, of pain, of agony.</p><p>If you want to be ecstatic, risk – risk all. Only by risking all does
one attain the all. Blessed are those who are drunk with God. Blessed
are those who are mad for God. Blessed are those who are no more part of
the insane crowd but have learned a new way of insanity – the way of the
Buddhas.</p><p>KAHE KABIR PIYE JOI JAN...</p><p><br></p><p>It is very rare that somebody decides, because it is very rare to be
so courageous, so brave.… MANA FIRAT MARE.</p><p>Then he lives like a madman, in utter ecstasy, in absolute
benediction, and he dies in utter ecstasy, in an absolute benediction.
Life can be a celebration and death too, but you will need to risk.</p><p><br></p><p>And that’s what my whole effort here is: to seduce you into risking
all for God. Remember, you have slept enough and you have not found
anything, you have dreamt enough and your hands are empty, you have
thought enough and where have you arrived? Now wake up.</p><p>Friend, now wake up!</p><p><br></p><p>CH APT E R <span class=s6>1 1</span></p><p><br></p><p>Le t yo ur a lo ne n e ss b ec om e a d a nc e</p><p><br></p><p>6 M a y 1 9 7 9 a m i n B u d d h a H a l l</p><p><br></p><p>The first question:</p><p><br></p><p>OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>NEVER BELONGED,</p><p>NEVER BEEN ON THE ‘INSIDE’,</p><p><br></p><p>NEVER FELT’AT ONE’ WITH ANOTHER,</p><p><br></p><p>WHY SUCH A LONER ALL MY LIFE?</p><p><br></p><p>Prem Madhura,</p><p><br></p><p>LIFE is a mystery, but you can reduce it to a problem. And once you
make a mystery a problem you will be in difficulty, because there can be
no solution to it. A mystery remains a mystery; it is insoluble – that’s
why it is called a mystery. Life is not a problem.</p><p>And that is one of the most basic mistakes we all go on committing:
we immediately put a question mark. And if you put a question mark on a
mystery, you will be searching for the answer your whole life and you
will not find it, and naturally it brings great frustration.</p><p><br></p><p>My observation of you, Madhura, is that you are a born meditator.
Rather than making it a problem, rejoice! Not to belong is one of the
greatest experiences of life. To be utterly an outsider, never feeling
to be a part anywhere, is a great experience of transcendence.</p><p><br></p><p>An American tourist went to see a Sufi Master. For many years he had
heard about him, had fallen in deep love with his words, his message.
Finally he decided to go to see him. When he entered his room he was
surprised – it was an utterly empty room! The Master was sitting; there
was no furniture at all! The American could not conceive of a living
space without any furniture. He immediately asked, “Where is your
furniture, sir?”</p><p>And the old Sufi laughed and he said, “And where is yours?”</p><p><br></p><p>And the American said, “Of course I am a tourist here. I cannot go on
carrying my furniture!”</p><p><br></p><p>And the old man said, “So am I a tourist for only just a few days,
and then I will be gone, just as you</p><p>will be gone.”</p><p>This world is just a pilgrimage – of great significance, but not a
place to belong to, not a place to become part of Remain a lotus leaf,
as Kabir says.</p><p><br></p><p>Madhura, this is one of the calamities that has happened to the human
mind: we make a problem out of everything. Now this should be something
of immense joy to you. Don’t call yourself a’loner’. You are using a
wrong word, because the very word connotes some condemnation. You are
alone, and the word ‘alone’ has great beauty. You are not even lonely.
To be lonely means you are in need of the other; to be alone means you
are utterly rooted in yourself, centered in yourself. You are enough
unto yourself</p><p>You have not yet accepted this gift of God, hence you are
unnecessarily suffering. And this is my observation: millions of people
go on suffering unnecessarily.</p><p><br></p><p>Look at it from another perspective. I am not giving you an answer, I
never give any answers. I simply give you new perspectives to see, new
angles.</p><p>Think of yourself as a born meditator who is capable of being alone,
who is strong enough to be alone, who is so centered and rooted that the
other is not needed at all. Yes, one can relate with the other, but it
never becomes a relationship. To relate is perfectly good. Two persons
who are both alone can relate, two persons who are both alone cannot be
in relationship.</p><p><br></p><p>Relationship is the need of those who cannot be alone. Two lonely
persons fall into a relationship. Two alone persons relate, communicate,
commune, and yet they remain alone. Their aloneness remains
uncontaminated; their aloneness remains virgin, pure. They are like
peaks, Himalayan peaks, high in the sky above the clouds. No two peaks
ever meet, yet there is a kind of communion through the wind and through
the rain and through the rivers and through the sun and through the
stars. Yes, there is a communion; much dialogue goes on. They whisper to
each other, but their aloneness remains absolute, they never
compromise.</p><p>Be like an alone peak high in the sky. Why should you hanker to
belong? You are not a thing! Things belong!</p><p><br></p><p>You say, “NEVER BELONGED, NEVER BEEN ON THE INSIDE.”</p><p><br></p><p>There is no need! To be an insider in this world is to get lost. The
worldly is the insider; a Buddha is bound to remain an outsider. All
Buddhas are outsiders. Even if they are in the crowd they are alone.
Even if they are in the marketplace they are not there. Even if they
relate they remain separate. There is a kind of subtle distance that is
always there.</p><p>And that distance is freedom, that distance is great joy, that
distance is your own space. And you call yourself a loner? You must be
comparing yourself with others: “They are having so many relationships,
they are having love affairs. They belong to each other, they are
insiders – and I am a loner. Why?” You must be creating anguish
unnecessarily.</p><p>My approach always is: whatsoever God has given to you must be a
subtle necessity of your soul, otherwise it would not have been given in
the first place.</p><p><br></p><p>Think more of aloneness. Celebrate aloneness, celebrate your pure
space, and great song will arise in your heart. And it will be a song of
awareness, it will be a song of meditation. It will be a song of an
alone bird calling in the distance – not calling to somebody in
particular, but just calling because the heart is full and wants to
call, because the cloud is full and wants to rain, because the flower is
full and the petals open and the fragrance is released... unaddressed.
Let your aloneness become a dance.</p><p>And Madhura is a dancer. And I am utterly happy with you, Madhura. If
you stop creating problems for yourself... I don’t see that there are
real problems. The only problem is, people go on creating problems!
Problems are never solved, they are only dissolved.</p><p><br></p><p>I am giving you a perspective, a vision. Dissolve your problem!
Accept it as a gift of God, with great gratitude, and live it. And you
will be surprised: what a precious gift, and you have not even
appreciated it yet. What a precious gift, and it is lying there in your
heart, unappreciated.</p><p>Dance your aloneness, sing your aloneness, live your aloneness!</p><p><br></p><p>And I am not saying don’t love. In fact, only a person who is capable
of being alone is capable of love. Lonely persons cannot love. Their
need is so much that they cling – how can they love? Lonely persons
cannot love, they can only exploit. Lonely persons pretend to love; deep
down they want to get love. They don’t have it to give, they have
nothing to give. Only a person who knows how to be alone AND joyous is
so full of love that he can share it. He can share it with
strangers.</p><p><br></p><p>And all are strangers, remember. Your husband, your wife, your
children, all are strangers. Never forget it! You don’t know your
husband, you don’t know your wife. You don’t know even your child; the
child that you have carried in your womb for nine months is a
stranger.</p><p>This whole life is a strange land; we come from some unknown. source.
Suddenly we are here, and one day suddenly we are gone, back to the
original source. This is a few days’ journey; make it as joyous as
possible. But we do just the opposite – we make it as miserable as
possible. We put our whole energies into making it more and more
miserable.</p><p><br></p><p>The second question:</p><p>WHAT IS CREATIVITY? DOES IT CORRESPOND MORE TO THE PATH OF AWARENESS
OR TO THE PATH OF LOVE? OR IS IT A CHILD OF BOTH?</p><p>Anand Kirti,</p><p><br></p><p>CREATIVITY is when you are not, because creativity is the fragrance
of the creator. It is the presence of God in you. Creativity belongs to
the creator, not to you. No man can ever be creative. Yes, man can
compose, construct, but can never be a creator.</p><p><br></p><p>When man disappears, when man becomes utterly absent, a new kind of
presence enters his being – the presence of God. Then there is
creativity. When God is inside you His light that starts falling around
you is creativity. The climate that arises around you because of the
presence of God within you is creativity.</p><p><br></p><p>It has nothing to do with awareness or love, although the creative
person is both. The creative person is aware, the creative person is
loving, but the creative person is neither a meditator nor a lover –
loving yes, but there is no lover; meditativeness yes, but there is no
meditator.</p><p>And when there is nobody inside you, that very nobodiness brings
creativity. It springs, it wells up, you become full of it. Whatsoever
you touch becomes gold. It is not your touch, remember; the miracle is
always God’s. It has nothing to do with the path of love or with the
path of awareness. The path of love and the path of awareness bring you
to God because they help you to disappear.</p><p>When God is there, then creativity is simply a consequence of His
presence, just His presence. You can attain to His presence through love
or awareness, it doesn’t matter. How you annihilate yourself is
irrelevant; the only thing is that you should be annihilated, that you
should not be. Do it through love, that will do. How you commit suicide
does not matter, with what kind of poison. Whether you jump from a
cliff, or you lie down in front of a railway train, or you shoot
yourself, or you hang yourself, it doesn’t matter. All that matters is
that you should have committed the suicide of the ego: through love,
through awareness; through Yoga, through Tantra, Taoism, Zen, Sufism,
Hassidism. It doesn’t matter; these are different ways of committing
suicide. I don’t mean the physical, I mean the metaphysical. Once you
are not there, all that is left is God.</p><p>You ask me, “DOES IT CORRESPOND MORE TO THE PATH OF AWARENESS OR TO
THE PATH OF LOVE? OR IS IT A CHILD OF BOTH?”</p><p><br></p><p>It has nothing to do with the path. Creativity is possible only when
the goal is achieved; it is a by- product of the goal. And don’t start
thinking in terms of a cross-breeding; cross-breeding is dangerous. You
are thinking, “Or is it a child of both?”</p><p>Just the other day I was reading...</p><p><br></p><p>A farmer was very fond of cross-breeding. First he crossed a chicken
with a goose and got a ‘choose’. Then he crossed a pheasant with an
eagle and got ‘pheagle’. Then he crossed a road with a bicycle and got
killed.</p><p><br></p><p>Beware of cross-breeding.</p><p><br></p><p>If you feel at home with love, it will do; or if you feel at home
with awareness it will do. Just remember one thing: that somehow, manage
to disappear.</p><p>There are people who need not even go on any path, love or
meditation. Just the sheer intelligence is enough, just seeing the point
is enough. Just seeing, “How can I be? I cannot exist alone, separate. I
cannot exist as an island. I am continuously connected with the whole. I
am breathing from every pore of my body; even if for a few seconds the
breathing stops, I will be no more.”</p><p><br></p><p>You are continuously eating, drinking. What are you eating? – the
universe, that’s what you are eating. What are you breathing? – the
universe, that’s what you are breathing. What are you drinking? – the
universe, that’s what you are drinking. Continuously, the universe is
going in and passing out. You are just a passage. The breath comes in,
refreshes you, rejuvenates you, goes out, another breath comes in We are
in a continuous relationship with existence. In fact, to say it is a
relationship</p><p>is not right: we are one with existence.</p><p>If one is REALLY intelligent, then neither love nor meditation – just
intelligence is enough. Just to see the point that we are one with
existence, hence there is nobody separate, and the ego is gone. And the
going of the ego is the coming of God. In fact, God is always there;
just because of the ego you cannot see Him.</p><p><br></p><p>And to see yourself as divine, as part of this immense existence, is
the beginning of creativity.</p><p><br></p><p>And this is not only the experience of the mystics. Of course this is
the experience of all the mystics of the world: you can ask Kabir or
Eckhart, you can ask Farid or Mansoor, you can ask Lieh Tzu or Rinzai.
You can ask different kinds of mystics, born in different times, to
different races, in different countries, unaware of each other’s
existence, and they will all say one thing: “The moment I disappeared,
God came in. Or maybe He was already there; just my presence was not
allowing Him to express Himself, to become manifest. I was obstructing
the way.”</p><p><br></p><p>But this is not only the experience of the mystics. Even the poets,
the musicians, the painters, have a few glimpses of it – of course only
glimpses, then they fall back to the ordinary world. They rise to the
sacred for a few moments.</p><p><br></p><p>Whenever Rabindranath would have the visitation, would have
creativity arising in him, he would not eat, he would not drink, he
would not sleep for days together. He would lock himself in his room, he
would not come out. He would come out only when the glimpse had
disappeared.</p><p>And those who saw him coming out after three, four days of remaining
in some other world all noted one fact: he looked so different, so
fragile, so unearthly, so light, as if not made of matter, so subtle,
nothing gross in him, his eyes so clear and so deep and his whole being
so transparent. But after a few hours he would be back again, settled in
the gross body, would be his old self again.</p><p><br></p><p>People used to ask him, “What happens when you close yourself in?” He
would say, “I close myself in, I lock myself in, so that nobody disturbs
me, because I am no more here. Any disturbance can be a very shattering
experience. I am so fragile that I would not like to be disturbed. Even
a little</p><p><br></p><p>sound is enough to bring me back to the earth, and those are the
moments when I am flying high,</p><p>when great poetry arises in me.”</p><p><br></p><p>That’s how GITANJALI was born, the book for which he got the Nobel
Prize. Many, many people have been given the Nobel Prize, I have seen
almost all the books for which a Nobel Prize has been given, but there
is no comparison with Rabindranath’s GITANJALI. ‘Gitanjali’ means
‘offering of songs’. It has some totally different quality, not of this
world. It echoes something of the Upanishads. It has some reflections of
Buddha, Jesus, Zarathustra, Lao Tzu. But Rabindranath was not a mystic,
he was only a poet.</p><p>A poet is one who becomes a mystic once in a while, who enters into
the world of the mystic once in a while but comes back because he has
not yet become capable of remaining there forever. He cannot abide
there, he can only have a visit. The poet is very close to the
mystic.</p><p><br></p><p>These three words have to be remembered. The scientist is the
farthest from the mystic because he lives with the gross matter, he
works with the gross matter. The poet is closer to the mystic. The
scientist functions from the head, the poet from the heart, and the
mystic lives in the being. When you are in the being, creativity is
simply your nature.</p><p><br></p><p>You ask me, ” WHAT IS CREATIVITY?”</p><p><br></p><p>For the mystic, his very existence is creativity. He walks, and that
is creativity. He talks, and that is creativity. He remains silent, and
that is creativity. Buddha, sitting in silence, is far more creative
than Rabindranath writing poetry, far more creative than Picasso doing
his painting, far more creative than Moore working on his sculpture...
just sitting silently!</p><p><br></p><p>So creativity has nothing to do with creating something, creativity
is simply the presence of God. Those who are fortunate enough to come in
contact with a buddha’s silence will be transformed; they will know what
creativity is. He has not done a thing and miracles have happened. He
has not uttered a word and the message has been heard. He has not moved,
but he has transformed you. He has not even touched you, and you are no
longer the same.</p><p>At the ultimate peak of being a mystic, creativity is just a climate.
Lower than that is the poet; then creativity brings great songs,
sculpture, architecture, poetry, music, painting. And even the
scientist, the lowest in this categorization – lowest because he works
with the lowest form of existence, matter – even the scientist, when he
is creative, has a few glimpses like the mystic.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, Albert Einstein: he has said many times that “All my
insights happened when I was not</p><p>working at all, in fact when I was not. All my great insights came to
me from some unknown source.”</p><p><br></p><p>The great scientist, Eddington, has said, “When I started working as
a scientist I used to think of the world as matter, as only matter. But
the more deeply I went into it, the more a few things started happening
to me which are incomprehensible in terms of science, mathematics,
calculation, measurement. And those things have revealed one thing to
me: now I can say that the world resembles more a thought than a
thing.”</p><p>All the great scientists... I am not talking about the technicians:
they are lower than the scientists, the fourth category, the last, the
SUDRAS, the untouchables. I am not talking about the technician.</p><p><br></p><p>The technician has no flight, no insight, no visitation from the
beyond. He simply knows how to do a certain thing, he is an adept in
‘how-toism’. He turns everything into a method. The technician is not a
scientist.</p><p><br></p><p>The scientist is one who very rarely, but still, reaches to the peaks
of the mystic. The poet is a visitor there more often, and the mystic
remains there. For the mystic creativity is a climate, for the poet it
is great activity, for the scientist even moreso: it is materialization
of something which is immaterial, great work. It took almost twenty
years for Albert Einstein to formulate the Theory of RelativitY – GREAT
work. The insight happens in a split second, but then you have to work
it out, you have to prove it through experimentation.</p><p><br></p><p>The poet needs no proofs; you never ask for proof The scientist is
asked for proofs, experimental proofs, and the experiments may take
years. Sometimes it has happened that the insight is there but the
experimentation has taken years and years. Still a few of Albert
Einstein’s theories are not yet proved by experimentation. They are just
theories, with every possibility of being proved true, but with no way
to prove them this way or that, for or against. Still no experiment is
possible.</p><p>For example, Albert Einstein said that time is such a relative
phenomenon that if a passenger leaves the earth on a spaceship at the
speed of light – the speed of light is immense,’almost inconceivable:
one hundred and eighty-six thousand miles per second... if a spaceship
leaves the earth at that speed, then the person who is moving in that
spaceship will never age. If he is young, twenty-five years old, he will
remain twenty-five years old. Even if he comes back after twenty-five
years, all his friends on the earth will be fifty years old, he will
simply be twenty-five, because at that speed time stops.</p><p><br></p><p>Now this is simply a theory, an insight; we have not yet been able to
devise a spaceship which can move with that speed. But scientists say
that theoretically it seems right – but only theoretically. Now how did
Einstein arrive at it? – because there is no possibility for
experimentation. Obviously, it is not the conclusion of an experiment;
you cannot do any experiment. No spaceship is there which moves with
such speed. In fact, it may never be possible to have such a spaceship;
there are difficulties.</p><p><br></p><p>The most difficult thing is: whenever a thing moves at that speed it
turns into light. At that speed the heat is so much that no spaceship
can move at that speed, because the heat would burn it out. Just the
friction – one hundred and eighty-six thousand miles per second – the
very friction would be enough, and the spaceship and the passengers
would all be reduced to light, they would burn out. But maybe some day
we can find something which does not burn out, which remains intact, and
the passenger can move at that speed.</p><p><br></p><p>Then scientists think that Einstein is right: at that speed, time
stops. And if time stops you cannot age, so it is possible that a man
may leave on a spaceship, and when he comes back his children will be
older than him, or even his grandchildren will be older than him. If he
comes after eighty years, all his children will be gone, his children’s
children will be older than him, and he will have remained exactly at
the same age, with no change, with no difference, as if not a single
moment had passed.</p><p>Now this is a pure theory; they call it ‘pure physics’. How did
Einstein arrive at it? It is an insight, it is</p><p>a mystical experience. Albert Einstein had a few mystical
experiences. All his other theories</p><p><br></p><p>were also conceived in the same way; they have all been proved right,
slowly slowly, by experiments. Maybe this too is right.</p><p><br></p><p>Even the scientist comes to truth only when he is not, the poet comes
to beauty when he is not, and the mystic comes to God when he is not.
The scientist can only be approximately true, because the moments are
very rare and very fleeting. The poet can be a little more sure, on a
more firm ground, because the moments come often. But the mystic is
absolutely certain, hence his declarations.</p><p><br></p><p>The Upanishads say AHAM BRAHMASMI, I am God! Al Hillaj Mansoor
declares ANA EL HAQ! I am the Truth! These are not conclusions, these
are not arrived at through thought processes. These are intuitions,
experiences of the ultimate revelation. Mansoor had become one with
truth; he was no more separate.</p><p><br></p><p>So creativity has three layers; the ultimate is the mystic: he lives
in a climate of creativity. The poet, once in a while, brings some
treasures from the beyond; the scientist, also very rarely, but whenever
he can visit the ultimate he brings something precious to the world. But
one thing is certain – mystic, scientist or poet, whatsoever comes into
this world comes from the beyond.</p><p>To bring the beyond is creativity. To bring the beyond into the known
is creativity. To help God to be manifested in some form is
creativity.</p><p><br></p><p>The third question:</p><p><br></p><p>OSHO, WHAT IS HISTORY?</p><p><br></p><p>Asutosh,</p><p>HISTORY is time, hence all that is really significant is not included
in it, because all that is really significant is beyond time.</p><p>Buddha’s enlightenment under the Bodhi Tree... it is not a historical
fact; there is no way to prove that it really happened. It is such an
interior experience that you have to take it on trust. Buddha says it
happened: you can believe it, you can disbelieve it. If you disbelieve,
there is no way for Buddha to prove it. If you disbelieve it, only you
prevent your own enlightenment, that’s all. If you trust Buddha, a door
opens for you. In trusting you can hope that if it has happened to
Buddha it can happen to you too. Belief and disbelief have nothing to do
with Buddha’s experience, but they have something to do with you and
your future.</p><p>But history cannot prove that something happened that morning;
history has no record of it. It happened beyond time, hence history
cannot record it. It is unrepeatable, and history only records that
which is repeatable. History is nothing but the record of the
repetitious human stupidity. History is the record of all that is stupid
in the human mind. Genghis Khan, Tamurlaine, Nadir Shah, Alexander,
Adolf Hitler, these people are repeatable; Buddhas are not repeatable, a
Buddha happens only once.</p><p><br></p><p>Tamurlaine will have many, many incarnations, sometimes as Adolf
Hitler, sometimes as Ivan the Terrrible, sometimes as Josef Stalin and
sometimes as Mao Tse Tung; he will have MANY incarnations. Buddha will
never come again. He has gone beyond, gone to the further shore. Jesus
will not come again; Jesus cannot be repeated. These people are
unique.</p><p><br></p><p>History takes no note of the unique; history only takes note of the
common, the average, and the average is the lowest. History is nothing
but a vicious circle. It is a wheel: it goes on moving, the same spokes
go on coming up again and again and again.</p><p><br></p><p>Just the other day I was reading a parable by James Thurber, THE LAST
FLOWER. Meditate over it.</p><p><br></p><p>World War XII, as everybody knows, brought about the collapse of
civilization. Towns, cities, and villages disappeared from the earth.
All the groves and forests were destroyed and all the gardens and all
the works of art. Men, women and children became lower than the lower
animals. Discouraged and disillusioned, dogs deserted their fallen
masters. Emboldened by the pitiful condition of the former Lords of the
earth, rabbits descended upon them.</p><p>Books, paintings, and music disappeared from the earth, and human
beings just sat around, doing nothing. Years and years went by. Even the
few generals who were left forgot what the last war had decided. Boys
and girls grew up to stare at each other blankly, for love had passed
from the earth.</p><p><br></p><p>One day a young girl who had never seen a flower chanced to come upon
the last one in the world. She told the other human beings that the last
flower was dying. The only one who paid any attention to her was a young
man she found wandering about. Together the young man and the girl
nurtured the flower and it began to live again. One day a bee visited
the flower and a hummingbird. Before long there were two flowers, and
then four, and then a great many. Groves and forests flourished
again.</p><p>The young girl began to take an interest in how she looked. The young
man discovered that touching the girl was pleasurable. Love was reborn
into the world. Their children grew up, strong and healthy and learned
to run and laugh. Dogs came out of their exile. The young man
discovered, by putting one stone upon another, how to build a shelter.
Pretty soon everybody was building shelters. Towns, cities, and villages
sprang up. Song came back into the world and troubadours and jugglers
and tailors and cobblers and painters and poets and sculptors and
wheelwrights and soldiers and lieutenants and captains and generals and
major-generals and liberators. Some people went one place to live, and
some another.</p><p><br></p><p>Before long, those who went to live in the valleys wished they had
gone to live in the hills and those who had gone to live in the hills
wished they had gone to live in the valleys.</p><p>The liberators, under the guidance of God, set fire to the
discontent, so presently the world was at war again. This time the
destruction was so complete... that nothing at all was left in the world
except one man and one woman and one flower.</p><p><br></p><p>But that’s enough, that will do; that one flower will do. Again
everything will come back.</p><p><br></p><p>History is a wheel. It is a vicious circle, it goes on moving in the
same rut. Many, many times man has become very civilized, and many, many
times all civilization has disappeared from the earth. This is not for
the first time that we have discovered science. Ancient records tell
something else, a totally different story.</p><p><br></p><p>There is every possibility that the great continent of Atlantis was
drowned not by a natural calamity but by atomic explosion. In Hindu
scriptures particularly, great proofs are available that man had
discovered all the technology that we have discovered. It is a
rediscovery, it is not a discovery. The great war that is known as
Mahabharata had almost all the weapons that we have now. Ancient Indian
scriptures have stories about airplanes, atomic bombs, hydrogen bombs
and things like that.</p><p><br></p><p>Now we are again coming to a point where a total destruction will
happen. But a flower will be left and that will do, and again the whole
story begins from ABC. Many times it has happened. This is not the first
world that we are living in: many worlds have come and disappeared, many
civilizations have come and disappeared. Many civilizations have reached
the same peak of affluence, technology, knowhow. History is a
repetition.</p><p>One has to learn how to get out of history and out of time. One has
to learn how to get out of this wheel. One has to learn how to slip out
of the very process of time, and that’s what meditation is all
about.</p><p><br></p><p>The greatest contribution of the East to the world is nothing but
meditation, because it teaches you how to get out of the mind. Mind is
time, and time is history. When you get out of mind you get out of
history and out of time. And when you are out of mind, time and history,
where are you? You are in the whole, in the cosmic. You are in that
orgasmic, organic unity called God.</p><p><br></p><p>God is not part of history, God runs parallel to history. Hence those
who want to know God will have to unlearn history. History has made you
Christians, Hindus, Mohammedans, Indians, Germans, Chinese. History has
conditioned you. History has given you particular minds, ideas,
ideologies. You have to get out of all that, history has to be
forgotten. History is past, and the past is heavy. And if the past is
too much in the mind, you will go on repeating it in the future. What
else will you do? The past goes on repeating itself through you. Get out
of it!</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t ask what is history, ask how to get out of it!how not to be a
Hindu, because that is being part of a certain history. Ask how not to
be a Christian. Ask how not to be an Indian, an American. Ask how to
just be, without any adjective.</p><p><br></p><p>And that’s my whole effort here: to help you come out of your bondage
of the past.</p><p>A sannyasin is one who drops the bondage of history. And he says, “I
am simply a part of this whole. I am not part of human history, I am
part of the cosmic eternity.” And becoming part of cosmic eternity, you
are freed from all bondage and from all misery.</p><p><br></p><p>And more and more people are needed in the world who are free of
history, free of the past. Then only can we create a new world where
wars can cease, where more and more people can bloom in love, where more
and more people can become lotuses of celebration.</p><p><br></p><p>Enough of history! It should be stopped. There is no need to teach
all that nonsense and garbage, but we go on teaching the students. We go
on telling them more and more about the past. And the more we tell them
about the past, the more they become conditioned by it, and naturally
they will repeat it.</p><p><br></p><p>There is no need to tell them about the past; past is past, gone is
gone. They need something totally different: they need to be introduced
to the present. They need to be made aware of this moment. They need a
taste of now, not of then. They need to drink something from here, not
from there.</p><p><br></p><p>It will be a great blessing to the world if history simply disappears
from the schools, colleges, universities, and rather than teaching
history we teach how to get out of time, how to cease being a mind, how
to become a no-mind, because the no-mind is the door to God.</p><p>God has no history, history has no God in it. The fourth
question:</p><p>OSHO, DO YOU THINK THAT IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO BE HONEST, INTELLIGENT,
RELIGIOUS, AND YET BE IN POLITICS?</p><p><br></p><p>Surya Kant,</p><p><br></p><p>IT IS impossible. It is ABSOLUTELY impossible, CATEGORICALLY
impossible. If you are intelligent, why should you be in politics? It is
for the stupid, for the mediocre.</p><p><br></p><p>The intelligent person will have much more important things to do.
The intelligent person will not be interested in dominating others. His
whole interest will be in knowing himself To dominate the other is a way
of escaping from one’s own inner meaninglessness, inner emptiness, inner
hollowness. It is an escape from oneself. The intelligent person iS not
an escapist.</p><p>Politics is an escape, a GREAT escape. It keeps you so occupied, day
in, day out, that you cannot find even a few minutes for yourself. Even
when you sleep you think politics; it continues in your dreams. To be a
politician is a twenty-four hour job. You cannot relax because if you
relax you will be left behind. It is a tooth-and-nail struggle, it is a
cut-throat competition. It is pure violence.</p><p>Why should an intelligent person be in politics? And how can an
honest person ever be in politics? Honesty does not pay in politics. And
even if sometimes a politician is honest, he is honest only if it pays,
not for honesty’s sake. The proverb that ‘honesty is the best policy’
must have been invented by a politician. Even honesty becomes a policy!
How can honesty be a policy?</p><p>Honesty is religion, not a policy. Honesty is your heart, not a
policy. It is not that you are honest to gain something; you are honest
for the sheer joy of being honest. You are honest even if you have to
lose everything; it is worth losing everything. Honesty can never be a
policy, but politics makes everything a policy. An honest person and in
politics? Impossible!</p><p><br></p><p>“I hope I’ll be able to count upon your support,” the candidate said
to one merchant he called on.</p><p>“I’m afraid not,” was the reply. “You see, I’ve already promised my
support to your opponent.” The politician laughed. “In politics,” he
stated, “promising and doing are two different things.”.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, in that case,” declared the merchant affably, “I’ll be happy
to give you my promise.” In</p><p><br></p><p>politics and honesty? Never has it been heard of!</p><p><br></p><p>The politician named Strange lay on his deathbed. His lawyer was
summoned.</p><p><br></p><p>“As an epitaph, on my tombstone,” he gasped, “I only want to have the
words, ’Here lies an honest</p><p>politician’.”</p><p>The lawyer protested, “How will people know who’s buried under that
stone?”</p><p>The old man nodded wisely. “Don’t worry,” he advised. “Folks will
take one look at those words and they’ll all say, ‘That’s strange!’”</p><p><br></p><p>Strange was the name of the politician.…</p><p>Honesty needs guts. It needs you to expose yourself as you are. It
needs the courage to be naked. The politician cannot do that. He has to
wear masks, he cannot be naked. He has to fulfill the expectations of
the masses, so whatsoever you want he pretends to be that. Whatsoever
you want, he is ready-to promise it. He goes on promising contradictory
things to different people; his promise means nothing. He goes on
pretending different games and different roles.</p><p><br></p><p>If he goes to the Mohammedans he starts reciting the Koran. If he
goes to the Hindus he quotes the Gita. If he goes to the Christians he
pretends to be a lover of the Bible. And all this is just pseudo:
neither does he love the Gita nor the Vedas nor the Bible nor the Koran
– he loves only his ego, and he is ready to do anything, whatsoever is
required, to fulfill his ego. And you know it, and the whole world knows
it.</p><p>And the whole world complains about these politicians, but somehow
man is so stupid that if he gets out from the clutches of one
politician, immediately he enters into the cage of another. People go on
complaining, but still they go on falling victims to the same type of
people – not a bit of difference.</p><p><br></p><p>Man has to be freed from his stupid mind; only then will he be free
of the politicians. Hence politicians don’t want you to be intelligent.
They are very much against creating intelligence in people. For
thousands of years they did not allow people to be educated because that
was dangerous. Now they allow people to be educated, but the education
is such that it does not make you intelligent. On the contrary, it makes
you less intelligent.</p><p>When the child enters the school he is far more intelligent than when
he comes back from the university. Those twenty years will destroy much
that was immensely valuable. The real diamonds will be lost and he will
carry just words, jargon, theories, knowledge. He will have sold his
intelligence and he will have brought home just dead knowledge, dead
weight, dead wood, and he will live with that knowledge his whole life.
Still, we don’t have an educational system which helps people to become
intelligent.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why all over the world in all the universities there is great
ferment, great rebellion. It is a good sign: it simply indicates that
the young people of the world are becoming more and more alert that what
is called education is not education but a kind of conditioning, a
hypnosis. The older generation tries to mould the mind of the new
generation. The teacher is just an agent of the older generation. The
teacher is respected by the older generation because he is the agent: he
corrupts the minds of the new, but the corruption is done with such
skill that you will not become aware unless you are really alert,
watchful.</p><p><br></p><p>People go on complaining, but they go on doing the same thing
again.</p><p>Four friends met in a Moscow park. The first man heaved a sigh. The
second also sighed. So did the third.</p><p><br></p><p>The fourth said impatiently, “Oh, do stop talking !”</p><p><br></p><p>Now, in Moscow you cannot talk, but you can sigh. That is a way now:
you cannot say but you feel, you understand, what is being done to you.
The whole country, the whole Russian mind, is conditioned by the
politicians, so much so that nothing else is even made available.</p><p>I receive many letters from Russia. My books are being smuggled into
Russia. People are reading, the books are moving from hand to hand, but
underground. People cannot even write letters to me directly from Russia
because they will never reach. First the Russian government, and then
Morarjibhai Desai – it is impossible to reach! Every letter is opened,
every letter is delayed, and one never knows how many never reach. But a
few letters have reached because Russians have given them to tourists to
mail them somewhere in London or Paris, so that from London or Paris
they can reach. They reach to me, but I cannot answer them – they will
never receive those answers. People want to come.</p><p><br></p><p>One woman wrote from Russia that she is even ready to marry an Indian
if that can help her to come to India and to be a sannyasin – any
Indian! But in Russia that too is very difficult. They won’t allow you
to leave even if you marry. One of my friends married a Russian woman
but he could not bring her to India. She remained in Russia, he remained
in India. He has died now; the woman and the children are still
there.</p><p>The same is the case in China now. But the difference is only of
degrees; the difference is not qualitative. In the so-called democratic
countries it may not be so much, but t is exactly the same.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember, politics is against all kinds of expansion of
consciousness, because if people really become conscious they will not
follow stupid leaders. They will not need any leadership at alL they
will be a light unto themselves.</p><p>You ask me, “IS IT POSSIBLE TO BE HONEST, INTELLIGENT, RELIGIOUS, AND
YET IN POLITICS?”</p><p>Why should a religious person be in politics? For what? Politics is a
power-trip. The religious person is simply dissolving himself The
religious person is going in the opposite direction, where the ego has
to be dissolved utterly. It is not a power-trip, it is just the
opposite. Yes, when the religious person has disappeared great power
descends, but it is not your power, it is God’s power.</p><p><br></p><p>The politician is for his own power; he wants to be powerful. He
wants to command armies, nations. Deep down he is suffering from an
inferiority complex. Deep down he knows his worthlessness. He wants to
prove to himself and to others that he is not worthless, that he is
great. Politics is a kind of d isease.</p><p><br></p><p>Some day in the future, when people have become a little more alert
and aware, politics will be thought of as neurosis, just as now you
think many things are incomprehensible. For example, five thousand years
ago magic ruled the whole world, the magician was the most important
person in any community. Now where is the magician? Who bothers about
the magician? Maybe once in a while he can give an entertainment to a
party or in a club or in a hotel – just entertainment. Otherwise, what
is his power? Once he was very powerful; he still is in primitive
societies. In African tribal communes he is still very powerful – people
believe that he has power. Now we know that he has no power; he has
power only because people believe he has power. His power is not in him
but in people’s beliefs. Now the magician is gone.</p><p><br></p><p>Then the priest became very powerful; even kings were not so powerful
as the priest. Now where is the priest? What is his power now? – no
power at all! He has become part of the past.</p><p>Let me tell you, sooner or later the politician will go the same way
– down the drain – as the magician has gone, as the priest has gone, as
the kings have gone. So is it going to be the case with the politician.
As human consciousness grows bigger and bigger, brighter and brighter,
all these illnesses that are hanging around us – hangovers of the past!
– will disappear.</p><p><br></p><p>The new man will not know much about politics. The new man will not
be nationalistic. The new man will not believe in states, the new man
will believe in a universal brotherhood. Yes, there will be a kind of
government, international government, but its use will be functional
just like the post office. You don’t think much about the postmaster...
or do you? Even the postmaster-general, who cares? – he is just a
functionary. So should the case be with the prime minister and the
president. Yes, a certain kind of order is needed in society because
there are so many people. A certain kind of government will be needed
and a few people will have to do the work, but it is nothing to brag
about.</p><p><br></p><p>Politics is finished. It is only a past relic, an antique relic, soon
to be preserved in the museums. The future does not belong to
politics.</p><p>The future belongs to a totally different kind of man – a man who
will know how to love, not how to possess; a man who will know how not
to be powerful, a man who will know egolessness; a man who will be
capable of dropping all games and living an authentic life of deep
meditation, of great love, of poetry.</p><p><br></p><p>The last question:</p><p>OSHO, A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO WHEN I FIRST CAME TO LISTEN TO YOU, I
FELT A ONENESS WITH YOU. I HAVE ATTENDED MANY OF YOUR MORNING
DISCOURSES.</p><p><br></p><p>I WAS A BIT SAD WHEN ONE DAY I HEARD YOU SAYING THAT YOUR ENERGIES,
GRACES AND BLESSINGS ARE AVAILABLE ONLY FOR YOUR SANNYASINS. STILL ON
THE 27TH APRIL,</p><p><br></p><p>I ATTENDED ONE OF YOUR ENERGY DARSHANS, STEALING ENERGY FROM YOU.
WHAT IS IT THAT MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR A CATHOLIC PRIEST TO TAKE YOUR
SANNYAS? OR CAN ONE BE BOTH A PRIEST AND YOUR SANNYASIN? OR ARE YOU
THINKING OF FORMING A GROUP OF ANONYMOUS SANNYASINS?</p><p><br></p><p>Joy Cheriyan,</p><p><br></p><p>FROM my side there is no problem at all – you can be a sannyasin. It
does not matter whether you are a Catholic priest or a Catholic thief! I
don’t prevent even Catholic thieves, so what to say about the Catholic
priest? To me, it is all the same!</p><p><br></p><p>I give sannyas unconditionally. There is no condition attached to it,
no strings attached. I don’t even ask who you are, what your profession
is, what religion, what nationality. Those are irrevelant things.
Somebody has to be a businessman, somebody has to be a policeman; just
like that, you are a Catholic priest. It is a profession.</p><p>From my side there is no problem: Cheriyan, you can become a
sannyasin. And deep down your heart is ready for it. How can I say no to
you? I never say no to anybody. If your heart is ready, then become a
sannyasin and go on doing whatsoever you are doing.</p><p><br></p><p>But the problem may come from the Catholics; for that I cannot
guarantee anything. They may not allow you, they will be afraid. I am
not afraid! I give sannyas to you because I know that if you become a
sannyasin, if this light enters into your being, then the darkness,
whatsoever its name – Catholic, Protestant, Hindu, Mohammedan – will go.
But the darkness will be afraid, the darkness will not allow you to take
the light in.</p><p>But if you are not courageous you can go on stealing. Don’t be
worried, that too is perfectly good.</p><p>Sooner or later, when you have stolen enough light, the darkness will
be gone.</p><p><br></p><p>There are different kinds of people: sometimes a few things are
sweeter when they are stolen – like kisses, et cetera. The stolen kiss
has more sweetness. Maybe, if that is your way, perfectly good! The
whole point is that the light should reach to your heart.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, by becoming a sannyasin you will become a real Catholic for
the first time. Catholicism is a quality: to be Catholic means to be
liberal, to be understanding, to be humble. To be a Catholic in reality
has nothing to do with the Vatican. It has something to do with a new
quality in your heart: the openness, the vulnerability, the capacity to
accept even those who are opposed to you, the capacity to love the
enemy. That is what the real spirit of being a Catholic is. By becoming
my sannyasin you will be entering into the real Catholic spirit.
Certainly you will be in difficulty with your church, but that risk has
always been there.</p><p>When Jesus started his work he was getting into trouble with HIS
church, the Jewish church. He was getting into trouble with the rabbis.
It was those rabbis who killed Jesus, but it was good that Jesus
tried.</p><p>And it will be good, Cheriyan, if you also try. What can be taken
away? Yes, I know a Catholic priest enjoys many privileges which are not
available to other priests – material privileges. But if you are</p><p><br></p><p>satisfied with them, then it is okay. You are not satisfied with
them, that’s why you are here; your</p><p>being here is enough proof.</p><p><br></p><p>But I am not saying to leave your priesthood If your church can
allow, you can be a sannyasin and a priest both. In fact I would like
you to remain a priest and a sannyasin both, so that you can seduce a
few more Catholics!</p><p>You also ask, “OR ARE YOU THINKING OF FORMING A GROUP OF ANONYMOUS
SAN NYAS I NS?”</p><p>I am not thinking to form a group of anonymous sannyasins, but that
group is also forming itself. There are many who would like to be
sannyasins but are not courageous enough. I am not thinking to form it,
because the anonymous sannyasin simply shows that he is not courageous
enough to declare to the world that he belongs to me, that he is hiding
a fact, that he is afraid of facing the world. That is a kind of
cunningness; that is a dual personality. In the heart you will be with
me and on the outside you will not be with me. That duality will create
a split in you. On the outside you will have to speak against me; it
will hurt you, and you will become two persons. And to be divided is to
be in misery. And if you are cunning, even if you are here you will not
be able to get as much nourishment as would have been easily possible
for you to get if you had been a little less cunning, a little more
sincere and honest.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, Cheriyan, you can steal a little bit of light, but there is no
need to steal because I am ready to offer it to you. I can give to you
in abundance. All that is needed is courage on your part to receive
it.</p><p><br></p><p>And remember, these are rare opportunities. There were many who
missed Jesus, there were many who missed Buddha, and there will be many
who will miss me. I hope that you will not be one of them.</p><p>Maggie was bemoaning her hard luck to her friend Tilly. The story she
told was a real heartbreaker.</p><p><br></p><p>It seems Maggie was coming home late from work and when she was only
a few blocks from her home a shiny new Cadillac convertible drew up
alongside her. In it was one of the handsomest young men Maggie had ever
seen. He whistled at Maggie. “Baby, would you mind my company tonight?”
he asked.</p><p>Maggie drew herself up. “On your way, mister,” she snapped. The</p><p><br></p><p>young man stopped the car and got out. He seemed contrite.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t take offence,” he said to Maggie. “You see, I just broke up
with my girl. I’m lonesome. I want to go out to dinner, to a nightclub,
to dance. And you looked so pretty, so sweet, I just couldn’t resist
asking you.”</p><p><br></p><p>Maggie didn’t trust herself. The guy was too goodlooking, the
situation too attractive. Maggie didn’t</p><p>think it was okay.</p><p><br></p><p>“Tell you what,” she said to the young man, “would you still want to
date me tomorrow?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sure,” replied the young man.</p><p><br></p><p>“Take my phone number. Call me tomorrow. I’ll tell you then.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You’ve got a date,” said the guy. Maggie gave him the phone number.
The guy hopped back into his car. “Look real nice for me,” he said and
pressed something into her hand. Then he drove away.</p><p>“You see,” Maggie told her friend Tilly, “when I opened my hand, I
saw he’d put a hundred dollar bill into it.”</p><p>“So what’s there to cry about?” asked the puzzled Tilly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Because,” sobbed Maggie, “I gave him the wrong phone number!”</p><p><br></p><p>Cheriyan, if you are with me anonymously, one day or other you will
repent – because you will be giving me your wrong phone number.</p><p>Be true! If your heart is beating faster with me, if a flame is
arising in your being, of love, of surrender, of trust, then go with it.
Then risk all! Then whatsoever happens will be good, you will never
repent.</p><p><br></p><p>Many times it happens that we unnecessarily go on missing some
opportunity. And this is so today! Tomorrow your heart may not beat,
tomorrow you may become hardened. Your mood may change, the situation
may not be the same. The connection may be broken, the bridge may be
lost. I may not be here, you may not be here. Who knows what happens
tomorrow? Never postpone!</p><p><br></p><p>As far as I am concerned you are perfectly accepted, respectfully,
lovingly. You can remain a Catholic priest – nothing is wrong in it –
and yet be a sannyasin... because to be a sannyasin is something so deep
that nothing can destroy it. Your being a Catholic priest is something
imposed by others on you. Your being a sannyasin will be your own
longing, it will be your own desire.</p><p>And whenever something arises in your heart as your own longing,
never deny it, because to deny it is to deny God. To deny it is to deny
your whole life. To deny it is to remain unfulfilled.</p><p><br></p><p>C H A P T E R <span class=s9>12</span></p><p><br></p><p>A l l o w h i m t o r e a c h y o u</p><p><br></p><p>7 M a y 1 9 7 9 a m i n B u d d h a H a l l</p><p><br></p><p>The first question:</p><p>OSHO, FOR ME, YOU ARE ALL THE MASTERS THAT HAVE BEEN BEFORE AND ALL
THE MASTERS THAT WILL COME. MORE AND MORE A STRANGE KNOWING GROWS THAT
ONLY DEATH IS THE DOOR TO THIS PERFECT UNION WITH ‘I DON’T KNOW WHAT’.
LOVING THE MASTER – LOVE – ONLY GIVES US GLIMPSES OF WHAT DEATH CAN MAKE
US SEE. IS THIS NOT SO?</p><p><br></p><p>Prem Puneeta,</p><p>LOVE is a small death, and death is great love. They are not two
things. Love is a small wave in the ocean of death. Hence people are
afraid of love too, as much as they are afraid of death.</p><p><br></p><p>People only pretend the game of love, they don’t go into it. They
keep a distance from any deep commitment, from any total involvement,
because if you really go very close in the world of love, the flame of
love is going to burn your ego.</p><p>People love – at least they pretend, they believe that they love –
because life without love is meaningless. If they don’t love life is
meaningless; if they really love the ego disappears. Hence they make a
compromise: they go only so far. They don’t go to the deepest core of
it, they only touch the surface. They cannot remain without it; without
it they are utterly futile. Then life is a</p><p><br></p><p>desert with no significance, no song. Then life is utterly futile –
you only vegetate, you don’t really love, you don’t really live. Loving
and living are synonymous.</p><p><br></p><p>So people have to at least play the game of love; that keeps them
involved. But they don’t really go into it. They keep out of it, because
if they really go into it then the ego disappears. Then they are no
more, then God is.</p><p>The experience of orgasm, of deep orgasmic joy, is the first
experience of God. God comes when two lovers meet and merge into each
other. When two are no more two, when that union happens, God penetrates
you. Then the beyond comes to the earth, the sky meets the earth.</p><p><br></p><p>But rarely are you in an orgasmic unity; rarely are you so much in
tune with the other that you are ready to sacrifice your ego. In fact,
you go on doing the contrary: your love is also an ornament for your
ego; your love is also a new treasure to strengthen the ego, to gratify
the ego. Rather than destroying it, your games about love go on
nourishing</p><p><br></p><p>But Puneeta, your insight is absolutely right: love can only give you
glimpses. If you allow the ego to disappear, love will make you
available to something of the unknown. Love will teach you how to die;
love is the first lesson of death. Death is the crescendo of love, the
highest peak. Those who know how to love know how to die. Their death is
not an end; it is a beginning, it is a birth, it is moving into the
divine. It is transcending the human and entering the superhuman. It is
transcending the mortal and entering into the immortal. Death is a
portal, a door.</p><p><br></p><p>But death is a door only if you have learned the lesson through love.
Love is the school that prepares you for death. Love and life are
synonymous: if you love you live. If you love and live you become
capable of dying.</p><p>Millions of people die, but without being capable of dying. They die
in unconsciousness. Then death simply takes them back into another body;
then death simply helps them to enter into another womb. And the whole
wheel starts moving again, the same repetitive wheel.</p><p><br></p><p>Those who die consciously... And love makes you utterly conscious.
Love makes you alert, because love is light. It dispels all darkness,
all unconsciousness. It becomes a lamp inside you. And if you have that
lamp, death has a totally different quality: it is not death at all; it
is life abundant, it is life infinite, it is life divine, it is life
eternal.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, Puneeta, you are right: “LOVING THE MASTER – LOVE ONLY GIVES US
GLIMPSES OF</p><p>WHAT DEATH CAN MAKE US SEE. IS THIS NOT SO?”</p><p>It is so, but it is only love that will prepare you. The greater the
love, the greater is the preparation. Hence one has to remain grateful
forever towards all that love has contributed – and not only the love
for the Master. Even loving a tree or a rock or an animal or your woman,
your man, your child, even these loves prepare you for the great love
that happens between the disciple and the Master. All your loves are
involved in it, implied in it.</p><p><br></p><p>Love towards the Master is the whole spectrum of love. The way you
have loved your woman will be there, the way you have loved your man
will be there, the way you have loved your mother will</p><p><br></p><p>be there, and the way you have loved your child will be there. The
way you have loved music, the way you have loved poetry, painting,
dancing, all your loves, the whole multiplicity of loves, all the
dimensions of love, will join together. Between the Master and the
disciple, love comes to its whole spectrum. It becomes the whole
rainbow, all the seven colors. And that love will prepare you for the
ultimate quantum leap, death.</p><p><br></p><p>In the ancient scriptures, the Master is defined as death. You will
be surprised: ancient scriptures say ACHARYO MRITYU, the Master is
death. If you have known the Master, you are coming closer and closer to
death. Coming very close to the Master is coming closer to the ultimate
death. One day the disciple and the Master both disappear.</p><p>The Master has already disappeared. The Master is the person who has
attained to nothingness. The Master is one who is already dead, who is
no more, who is just an absolute emptiness. If you come close to the
Master... And that’s what disciplehood means: coming closer and closer
to somebody who is no more. And of course, to come closer to somebody
who is no more is going to destroy your ego utterly. One day, through
the Master, you taste your first experience of death.</p><p>Hence people avoid living Masters, because living Masters are nothing
but death. People love dead Masters because they cannot do anything to
you. It is beautiful to worship Buddha, it is very, very convenient to
worship Jesus, it is difficult to come close to me. It was difficult to
come close to Buddha too when he was alive. Remember the paradox: when
Buddha is alive he is death, hence the fear. When Buddha is dead then
there is no problem – you can worship, you can hold the statue of Buddha
close to your heart. Now the Buddha is just a toy, he is in your hands.
He cannot destroy your ego; in fact, your ego will use him. Even Buddha,
Jesus, Krishna, are used by the ego to become stronger.</p><p><br></p><p>Only a living Master is fire enough, flame enough, to bum you
totally, utterly, absolutely. SATSANG, to be with the Master, is the
ultimate in love and the beginning of death.</p><p>Puneeta, your insight is beautiful, a gift of your meditativeness, of
your love for me, of your love for the commune. Go on moving in the same
direction. Don’t go astray. Many fears will arise. Many times the mind
will say, “Go back! It is too dangerous.” Don’t listen to the mind,
listen to the heart. The heart knows what is right, the heart feels what
is right.</p><p>It is a feeling; that’s why you don’t know: “I don’t know for what,
towards what.” The movement is happening. You cannot know it, but you
can feel; the feeling is there. And one day the feeling becomes
knowing.</p><p><br></p><p>When feeling becomes knowing, one has become enlightened. Knowledge
is not real knowing. When feeling becomes knowing one is enlightened.
The moment feeling becomes knowing, there is no distinction between
being and knowing, that is called wisdom. Then your heart starts pouring
not only your joy, not only your songs, but your wisdom too. That’s how
all the great scriptures were born.</p><p><br></p><p>Mohammed was an ignorant person, illiterate, but when it happened –
this knowing, this feeling, this being happened – when he managed to die
in the love of God, this illiterate, ignorant person started pouring
immensely beautiful verses. The Koran has tremendous beauty, simplicity
and beauty both</p><p><br></p><p>together. It is not complex. It has the beauty of the roses, the
stars. It has the music of the birds, and the wind passing through the
pine trees, and the sound of running water. And it came out of a man who
never knew how to read, how to write, who had no knowledge but who had a
heart. In fact, because he had no knowledge it was easy for him to feel,
and it was easy for him to dive deep into feeling, so deep that he
touched the very rock-bottom of being.</p><p>And this is how Jesus speaks. His prose is not prose, it is poetry.
There is no comparison. Jesus’ statements have such poetry in them, they
are incomparable; so are Buddha’s. They are all unique in their own
ways. They are peaks, different peaks reaching beyond the clouds. But
one thing is exactly the same: they are rooted in the same experience.
The experience is not of knowledge; the experience first is of feeling
and then is of being.</p><p>Go on moving in the same direction, unafraid. That’s why I am here
with you – to help you. That’s what sannyas is all about, Puneeta. When
dangers arise and when your mind may start thinking of escaping, I have
to keep you, I have to hold you. I have to go on pushing you, I have to
go on persuading you. And if you can listen, and if you can gather
courage, and if you can go through this dark night of the soul, the dawn
is not far away. In fact, when the night is the darkest, the dawn is the
closest.</p><p>The second question:</p><p><br></p><p>OSHO, IT APPEARS THAT ALMOST ALWAYS A PATTERN OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR
FOLLOWS THIS: WE SEARCH FOR FOOD, SHELTER, CLOTHING; THEN MONEY, POWER
AND PRESTIGE, AND HAVING ATTAINED THESE, WE THEN SEARCH FOR GOD. WOULD
IT NOT MAKE MATTERS MUCH SIMPLER TO SOMEHOW IMPRESS UPON OUR YOUNG ONES
TO BEGIN WITH GOD?</p><p><br></p><p>Zareen,</p><p>THERE is a hierarchy of needs, and you cannot bypass any step. If you
bypass any step you will have to come back to it again. Life has an
intrinsic logic in it. Each step has its own place, and you cannot miss
a single step. Otherwise the chain will be broken and your life will
become discontinuous, your life will become a chaos.</p><p><br></p><p>There is a hierarchy of needs: body, mind, soul, God.</p><p>First the bodily needs have to be fulfilled. If they are not
fulfilled you will not have higher needs arising – impossible. The
hungry person cannot think of music. If you start playing on the guitar
before a hungry person, there is every possibility that he may retaliate
in anger. He may throw your guitar, he may break your guitar, because it
is insulting, it is humiliating.</p><p>Once Vivekananda was asked in America, “Why have you to teach here?
Why don’t you teach in India?”</p><p>He said, “Here I can talk about Vedanta, the ultimate truth. But in
India, seeing people hungry, I feel ashamed of talking about God,
ultimate realization. It is insulting to those poor people. They need
bread.”</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus is right when he says man cannot live by bread alone, but this
is only a half-statement. The other half has not to be forgotten: man
cannot live without bread either. And in fact, the bread is very
fundamental, your body is very fundamental. If your body is ill, hungry,
in pain, you cannot compose poetry, you cannot paint, or even if you
paint your painting will remain that of suffering. If you compose music
your music will be nothing but your cry, your scream. If you write
poetry your poetry will be political. Your poetry will not be poetry at
all but slogans. The bodily needs have to be fulfilled first. Yes, don’t
get stuck there.</p><p><br></p><p>That has to be remembered, Zareen: the children have to be helped to
go beyond the body, but you cannot bypass it. They have to be helped to
know the joys of the mind, the beauties of the mind – art, poetry,
painting, music; great joys of the mind. When they are fulfilled then
the third need arises, the needs of the soul. Then meditation becomes
important.</p><p><br></p><p>Only a person who has lived deeply in music is capable of meditation,
because music prepares the background, creates the space, the context,
in which meditation becomes simple. And the person whose soul-needs are
fulfilled, whose meditation-needs are fulfilled, will be able to
pray.</p><p>Prayer is the fragrance of the flower of meditation. That is the
ultimate.</p><p><br></p><p>Zareen, you say, ” WOULD IT NOT MAKE MATTERS MUCH SIMPLER TO SOMEHOW
IMPRESS UPON OUR YOUNG ONES TO BEGIN WITH GOD?”</p><p>That’s what people have been doing, that’s what you have been doing,
that’s what has been done down the ages. Children are being impressed
upon to begin with God, and they cannot begin, because all the three
steps of the temple are missing and they cannot enter into the temple.
Those steps are very much needed. That’s why our temples have become
false. Our temples are arbitrary, artificial. Our temples are mind
creations – with good intentions, of course.</p><p><br></p><p>Now Zareen is asking with a good intention – to help the children.
But this is not the way to help, this is the way to hinder. That’s how
people have become irreligious: Christians they are, Mohammedans they
are, Parsees they are, Hindus they are, but not religious.</p><p>We have created artificial gods. We had to create artificial gods
because our own needs are not grown up.</p><p><br></p><p>To contact the REAL God these things cannot be done in a hurried way.
These things are not like seasonal flowers; these are great trees,
cedars of Lebanon – they take hundreds of years to grow. Lives are
nothing; time is not the question at all. And one should go very
scientifically.</p><p><br></p><p>First, fulfill the needs of the body. And what do we do?we condemn
the body. Rather than fulfilling the needs, rather than helping a child
to enjoy the joys of the body, we condemn the body. The body has many
joys of its own: the joy of running, the joy of surfing, the joy of
swimming, the joy of jogging, the joy of climbing a mountain. Those are
all physical joys, of tremendous value. When one is climbing a mountain
alone, the body has a thrill of its own, its ecstasy.</p><p>Teach the child first the bodily ecstasy. Let him dance as totally as
possible, so he can have a feel of</p><p>his own body. There are millions of people who don’t have any feel of
their own body. They use</p><p><br></p><p>the body just like a mechanical device around them, but they don’t
have a feel for it. They live in the</p><p>body, but they are not bridged with the body. They don’t know the
joys of the body.</p><p><br></p><p>The children first have to be taught the physical joys. Help them to
climb the trees, help them to run, help them to swim, help them to
dance, help them to do physical yoga, hatha yoga, so they can have a
feel of their bodies, so their bodies can be felt as alive phenomena –
not something dead around them, not something disconnected, not like a
machine to be used – so that they can have a respect for the body, love
for the body, so their bodies can become sacred temples.</p><p>And then don’t be in a hurry. The next step has to be taken very
slowly. The movement from the body to the mind has to be very, very
delicate, because you are moving from the gross to the subtle. And the
movement cannot be very direct; it has to be very indirect. Slowly,
slowly let the child know about music, poetry. Let the child know about
great paintings, architecture. Let the child enjoy the exercise of his
mind.</p><p><br></p><p>And then when the child is ready, when he has fulfilled his mind
needs, help him to meditate. And nothing has to be done in haste. Let
everything ripen, help everything to become mature. Just remember one
thing: that the child should not get stuck anywhere. There are many who
have become stuck at the body, the physical pleasure; then sex remains
their center of life. There are many who have got stuck in the mind;
then thinking, philosophizing, logic, and the joys of thinking and
philosophizing and logic, remain for their whole lives. These people are
half-grown people.</p><p>Before the child gets stuck somewhere, push him to the further level,
to the further plane. Help him to meditate.</p><p><br></p><p>And only after meditation is prayer possible, because only one who
has learned to experience his soul can experience the universal soul. If
you cannot know your own soul, how can you know the soul of the whole
universe? If you cannot look deep into the drop of water, how can you
see into the ocean? Impossible! Prayer is the ultimate fragrance.</p><p>But what happens, Zareen, is that we start teaching children prayer;
that’s where we go wrong. We start teaching them about God. The question
has not arisen yet in their hearts and we start stuffing them with
answers. They have not asked yet about God – they are not worried about
God, that is not their concern – and we go on implanting ideas in their
minds. In their immature minds we go on giving them conditions,
indoctrination, philosophies, which will remain just a baggage, a
burden. They will be Christians and Hindus and Mohammedans, but they
will not be religious, never. In fact, because of your indoctrination
they will hate you, and they will hate your gods, and they will hate
your temples, and they will hate your priests. Although they will
formally go to the church on Sunday and formally they will go to the
priest to be married, this will be simply a formal thing because it is
the accepted form in the society. But deep down they hate, deep down
they have no love for all this.</p><p>Parents have been trying to help their children to become religious
without becoming aware that they themselves are not religious yet.
Zareen, do you really know that God is? You have become concerned about
the children: this may be just a way of escaping from your own problem.
Do you know God is? Have you felt God yourself?</p><p>If you have felt, if you have known God, this question would not
arise, because then you would have seen that there is a logical sequence
of growth – the body, the mind, the soul, and ultimately God.</p><p><br></p><p>You cannot bypass any step. And if you bypass, something will remain
missing, and there is EVERY possibility that you will have to come back
to the missing part again.</p><p><br></p><p>Let every part of your being be saturated, contented, so there is no
need to look backwards and one can go ahead and ahead and ahead.</p><p>The third question:</p><p><br></p><p>OSHO, WHY AM I AFRAID OF WOMEN?</p><p>Prabhudas,</p><p><br></p><p>IT IS not your personal question, it is almost universal. All men are
afraid of women, and all women are afraid of men – because all people
are afraid of love. The fear is of love. Hence man is afraid of woman
because she is the object of love, and women are afraid of men because
they are the object of their love.</p><p><br></p><p>We are afraid of love because Love is a small death. Love requires
that we should surrender, and we don’t want to surrender at all. We
would like the OTHER to surrender, we would like the other to be a
slave. But the same is the desire from the other side: man wants the
woman to be a slave; and of course the woman also wants the same, the
SAME desire is there. Their methods of enslaving each other may be
different, but the desire is the same.</p><p><br></p><p>Man’s methods are crude, the woman’s methods are more subtle. If the
man wants to destroy the freedom of the woman, he may beat the woman. If
the woman wants to destroy the man’s freedom, she may beat herself – and
that is far more effective, remember! She may cry and weep... that is
far more clever too; that leaves the man absolutely indefensible. If you
hit somebody the other can retaliate, react. The other can also hit you,
or at least can defend. But if you hit yourself, then the other cannot
do anything. The other is simply defenseless, the other is simply
defeated.</p><p><br></p><p>So men only THINK that they are the masters in the house, the women
know far better. But they never declare their mastery. In fact, they
need not declare it because it is so certain. Man has to declare because
he is uncertain, hesitant. And the woman always agrees with him that,
“Yes, you are the master.” She can afford to agree; she knows far
better.</p><p><br></p><p>It is very rare to find a husband who is not henpecked. In fact, to
be a husband means to be henpecked, because I have not yet come across a
husband who is not henpecked! The word is superfluous,‘husband’ is
enough, because the ways of the feminine mind are so subtle that the
cruder ways of man never succeed.</p><p>It is said about a king that one day he was talking with ministers,
and the conversation moved to the</p><p>perennial subject, man/woman. And somebody said, “In your court
everybody is henpecked.” The king was offended. He said, “This cannot be
so!”</p><p><br></p><p>But the man insisted. He said, “Not only in your court – in your
whole capital you cannot find a single</p><p>man who is not henpecked.”</p><p><br></p><p>The king was offended. Immediately he called one of his most wise
men, gave him two horses, one black, one white, the most precious ones,
and told him, “Take these two horses, and whoever you are convinced is
not henpecked, let him choose one. If he wants the black he can choose
the black, or the white. Give it to him as a gift.”</p><p><br></p><p>The wise man went. Days passed, weeks passed and months passed, and
he tried in every way but he could not find anyone. Finally he came upon
a very strong man in a hilly place; he had never seen such a man. He was
just sitting outside, sunning himself. The wise man was impressed. He
said, “Here is the man who must be the master of his house.”</p><p><br></p><p>He asked him, “Who is the master of the house? Be true!”</p><p><br></p><p>The man simply showed his fists and his muscles. They were so big
that even the wise man became afraid. And the big man said, “Just look
at my muscles! What do you think? Who else can be the master of this
house?”</p><p>And the wise man asked, “Where is your wife?” She was a very lean and
thin woman; this man could have killed her at any moment, could have
just crushed her with his fists. She was working in a corner, cooking
something. He said, “That is my wife.”</p><p><br></p><p>The wise man was absolutely satisfied that this must be the master.
He said, “So you can choose:</p><p>the king has said you can choose the white or the black horse,
either, whichever you want.” And the man looked at the woman and said,
“Lalou’s mother, which one should I choose?” And the wise man said, “You
don’t get either! If Lalou’s mother is going to decide, finished!” That
lean, thin woman was going to decide.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the situation. Man tries in his ways, somehow, to possess the
woman; the woman tries to possess the man. The woman is afraid because
man can be physically violent. The man is afraid because the woman is
psychologically very very clever, very very powerful.</p><p><br></p><p>You ask me, Prabhudas, “WHY AM I AFRAID OF WOMEN?”</p><p>You are afraid of love; you are afraid of losing your ego. You are
asking a wrong question. And remember always: the mind tries many times
to give you a wrong question. A little twist, a little turn, and the
question becomes wrong.</p><p><br></p><p>Now you ask, “WHY AM I AFRAID OF WOMEN?”</p><p><br></p><p>The question seems to be perfectly right; it is not. You should have
asked: why am I afraid of love? and then it would have been right. It is
a wrong question. But many times we ask a wrong question, thinking that
it is right.</p><p><br></p><p>Before you decide to ask a question, meditate over it. Look from all
the aspects. Sleep on it for a few days so that it becomes more and more
true – because if you ask a true question my answer will be of immense
help to you. But if your question’ is wrong in the first place, then my
answer cannot be of any help. Be straight, be down to earth! And don’t
be in a hurry to ask; meditate over the question from all possible
sides. First try to find your own answers. Do your homework first, and
then you will be able to ask the right question. In fact, to ask the
right question is almost half the answer.</p><p><br></p><p>The story is told about a Russian who came to a Welsh village to
contact a spy named Jones. Approaching the stationmaster, he inquired
where Mr. Jones lived.</p><p>“Oh, there’s lots of Joneses,” the villager replied. “I’m Jones the
stationmaster, and there’s Jones the postman, and...”</p><p><br></p><p>The Russian leaned close to the stationmaster’s ear. “It’s raining in
Birmingham today,” he whispered significantly.</p><p>“Oh,” said the stationmaster, “it must be Jones the spy you’re
looking for. Why didn’t you say so straight off?”</p><p><br></p><p>Be straight! Never go zig-zag!</p><p><br></p><p>Your question basically is, “Why am I afraid of love?” But you may
even be afraid to ask the question, because nobody wants to say that “I
am afraid of love.” Even to say that feels embarrassing, so we go on
asking other questions. We never ask exactly the question that is needed
to be pondered over. We ask other questions very close to it, but not
exactly it.</p><p><br></p><p>And this is not the first time, Prabhudas, that such a question has
come to me. Almost every day some woman asks “Why am I afraid of men?”
some man asks, “Why am I afraid of women?” Everybody seems to be afraid
of everybody else!</p><p><br></p><p>And just see – what can the poor woman do to you? what can the poor
man do to you? We are all in the same boat! Afraid we are, certainly,
but we are not really afraid of each other.</p><p>A defeated politician, after days and days of vainly looking for a
job, is walking home in despair when he suddenly sees the tent of a big
circus. He decides to try his luck and asks the director of the circus
for a job.</p><p><br></p><p>“The only person we need is a tightrope walker,” replies the
director.</p><p>The politician feels afraid but still accepts.</p><p><br></p><p>That evening, dressed as a monkey, it is announced: “Ladies and
gentlemen, you will now admire the flying monkey.”</p><p><br></p><p>The terrified politician climbs up the ladder until he reaches the
rope. Trembling, he starts walking along the rope when, overwhelmed by
the lights, the emotion and the crowd, he loses his balance and begins
to fall.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly he sees a number of lions climbing on top of each other
trying to reach him. Sure that his last moment has come he starts to
pray when he hears, “Don’t worry, brother, we are all other defeated
politicians.”</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t be afraid of women! They are really afraid of you... and you
are afraid of them... and unnecessarily creating much fuss, much noise,
for no reason at all. And both are missing the point. That point is:
fear of love.</p><p><br></p><p>Love frightens, scares, because love demands something which you are
not ready to pay. Love asks you to drop the ego: that is the price love
asks for. Without paying the price you cannot attain to love, and our
whole life is an effort to attain to love without paying the price.
Hence fear, jealousy, possessiveness, and all kinds of things arise in
life, but not love. We go on hoping against hope that there may be some
way that we can save our ego and still be in love. It is impossible, it
is not in the nature of things.</p><p><br></p><p>So if you want to be in love, this is the first thing to decide: “I
am ready to drop the ego.” And remember, you are not surrendering to the
woman; neither is the woman surrendering to you. That too is a fallacy;
a very wrong approach has given you that idea. You both are surrendering
to some unknown god of love. You both are surrendering to something
invisible. You are not surrendering to each other, not at all; that is a
wrong approach. Because of that wrong approach it becomes difficult to
surrender: “Why should I surrender to somebody else? That means her ego
will be more fulfilled!” And she also thinks, “Why should I surrender to
somebody? His ego will be more fulfilled. Who is he? Why should I
surrender to him?”</p><p>Remember, those who have looked deeply into the matter have something
else to say to you. My own observation is: lovers don’t surrender to
each other, they surrender to something unknown that exists between
them. They surrender to love – call it the ‘god of love’ – they both
surrender to the god of love. Hence nobody’s ego is fulfilled by your
surrender; both the egos disappear in love.</p><p>If you move with this understanding, all fear of women will
disappear. There is nothing to be afraid of: on the other side there is
the same trembling heart as yours, with the same fears. You will feel
compassion rather than fear. Both will help each other rather than
frightening each other, because both are in the same boat.</p><p>But remember, the surrender is on the altar of love, neither to man
nor to woman. Down the ages this has been taught to you: lovers
surrender to each other. That is utter nonsense! That must have been
said by people who don’t know what love is. Lovers NEVER surrender to
each other, lovers simply surrender to love. Yes, lovers lose their
egos, but they don’t give them to each other. Those egos simply
evaporate.</p><p><br></p><p>Lovers don’t become dependent on each other; they are not enslaved by
each other. On the contrary, love gives freedom. Lovers are the most
free people in the world. They help each other to become more and more
free, because freedom brings joy, and meeting out of freedom has immense
beauty.</p><p>When two lovers meet not out of some bondage but out of freedom,
there is benediction. The fourth question:</p><p>OSHO, YOU ONCE SAID THAT THIS IS A VERY BEAUTIFUL WORLD BUT IT IS IN
THE WRONG HANDS. I AGREE WITH ALL MY BEING. I FEEL IT. BUT HOW CAN WE
STOP THOSE GREEDY HANDS WHICH ARE TORTURING NATURE AND ENSLAVING MEN IF
WE DON’T FIGHT AND STRUGGLE? IS THE DESTRUCTION OF THE OLD NOT NECESSARY
FOR THE BUILDING OF THENEW?</p><p>Giovanni,</p><p><br></p><p>THAT is one of the oldest traps into which man has fallen again and
again. Yes, I say the world is a very beautiful world, but it is in
wrong hands – immediately your mind starts thinking how to destroy those
wrong people, how to take the world from those wrong people and out of
their hands. Rather than transforming yourself, rather than transforming
your own mind, you immediately start thinking in terms of politics. I
talk religion, you immediately interpret it in politics.</p><p><br></p><p>And it looks logical, Giovanni, because it seems perfectly right:
“HOW CAN WE STOP THOSE GREEDY HANDS WHICH ARE TORTURING NATURE AND
ENSLAVING MEN IS WE DON’T FIGHT AND STRUGGLE?”</p><p>But if you fight and struggle, do you think you will be able to
transform the world and its situation? By fighting and struggling you
will just become like those people against whom you are fighting and
struggling; that is one of the fundamental laws of life. Choose your
enemies very carefully! Friends you can choose without any care. There
is no need to be worried about friends because friends don’t have the
impact on you, don’t impress you so much as the enemy. One has to be
very careful with the enemy because you will have to fight the enemy. In
fighting, you will have to use the same strategies, the same tactics,
and you will use those strategies and tactics for years and years. They
will condition you. That’s how it has happened down the ages.</p><p><br></p><p>Joseph Stalin proved a far more dangerous czar than the czars that
had ruled Russia before communism took over. Why? – because he had
learned the strategy from the czars. Fighting with the czars, he had to
learn the ways and means, the same ways and means that they were using.
The whole life spent in fighting, practising violence: by the time
Joseph Stalin came to power he was a czar, far more dangerous obviously,
because he had succeeded against the czars. He must have been’ more
cunning, must have been more violent, must have been more ambitious,
must have been more Machiavellian. Otherwise it would have been
impossible to win against the czars.</p><p><br></p><p>And he did the same on a far greater scale: he defeated all the
czars! All the czars put together had never done so much violence, so
much murder, as Joseph Stalin alone did. He had learned the lesson so
well that it is suspected that the leader of the revolution, Lenin, was
poisoned by Joseph Stalin, slowly slowly, in the name of medicine. He
was ill, and in the name of medicine he was poisoned slowly, slowly and
killed. If Lenin were there then Joseph Stalin would be number three
man, because there was another man, Leon Trotsky, who was number two. So
the first thing was how to destroy Lenin – he killed Lenin – and then
the second thing was how to kill Trotsky – he killed Trotsky. Then he
was in power, and once he was in power he started killing everybody. All
the members of the Politburo, of the highest commanding communist
leaders, were killed by Stalin, by and by. Because they all knew the
strategies, they had to be removed.</p><p><br></p><p>This has happened with all the revolutions in the world.</p><p><br></p><p>Now when I say this world is a very beautiful world but it is in the
wrong hands, I don’t mean that you start fighting those wrong hands.
What I mean is: please don’t you be those wrong hands, that’s all.</p><p>I don’t teach revolution, I teach rebellion, and the difference is
great. Revolution is political, rebellion is religious. Revolution needs
you to organize yourself as a party, as an army, and fight against the
enemies. Rebellion means you rebel as an individual; you simply get out
of this whole rut. At least you should not destroy nature.</p><p><br></p><p>And if more and more people become dropouts the world can be saved.
That will be true revolution – nonpolitical; it will be spiritual. If
more and more people get out of the old mind and its ways, if more and
more people become loving, if more and more people are non-ambitious, if
more and more people are non-greedy, if more and more people are no more
interested in power-politics, in prestige, in respectability...</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what sannyas is all about! Sannyas is dropping out of the old,
rotten game and living your life on your own. It is not a struggle
against the old, it is simply getting out of the clutches of the old –
and this is the only way to weaken it, this is the only way to destroy
it.</p><p><br></p><p>If millions of people in the world simply get out of the hands of the
politicians, the politicians will die of their own accord. You cannot
fight with them. If you fight you become a politician yourself. If you
struggle against them you become greedy yourself, ambitious yourself;
that is not going to help.</p><p>Be a dropout. And you have a small life: for fifty years, sixty
years, seventy years you may be here – you can’t hope that you will be
able to transform the world, but you can hope that you can still enjoy
and love the world.</p><p><br></p><p>Use the opportunity of this life to celebrate as much as possible.
Don’t waste it in struggling and</p><p>fighting.</p><p><br></p><p>I am not creating a political force here, no, not at all. All
political revolutions have failed so utterly that only blind people can
go on believing in them. Those who have eyes are bound to teach you
something new.</p><p><br></p><p>This is something new! This has been done before too, but not on a
large scale. We have to do it on such a large scale – millions of people
have to become dropouts! By dropouts I don’t mean that you leave the
society and go to the mountains. You live in the society, but you leave
the ambition, you leave the greed, you leave the hatred. You live in the
society and be loving, and live in the society as a nobody.</p><p>That is the pure essence of sannyas: living as nobody, with no greed,
with no ambition. And then you can enjoy and you can celebrate. And by
celebrating and enjoying, you will spread the ripples of ecstasy to
other people.</p><p><br></p><p>We can change the whole world, but not by struggle – not this time.
Enough is enough! We have to change this world by celebrating, by
dancing, by singing, by music, by meditation, by love, not by
struggle.</p><p><br></p><p>The old certainly has to cease for the new to be, but please don’t
misinterpret me.</p><p><br></p><p>Giovanni is an Italian, and modern Italy is really much too
political; the whole thinking is political. The whole Italian mind is
obsessed with politics. Maybe one of the reasons is that they are fed-up
with the Catholic Vatican and the Pope and all that nonsense. They have
seen too much of it and they have moved to the other extreme.</p><p>Certainly the old has to cease – but the old is within you, not
without. I am not talking about the old structure of the society; I am
talking about the old structure of your mind that has to cease for the
new to be. And a single man dropping the old structure of the mind
creates such a great space for many to transform their lives that it is
incredible, unimaginable, unbelievable. A single person transforming
himself becomes a trigger; then many more start changing. His presence
becomes a catalytic agent.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the rebellion I teach: you drop out of the old structure, you
drop out of old greed, you drop out of old idealism. You become a
silent, meditative, loving person; you be more in a dance, and then see
what happens. Somebody, sooner or later, is bound to join the dance with
you, and then more and more people. This is how it has happened
here.</p><p><br></p><p>Lao Tzu says that you need not go outside your room; everything can
happen just living inside your room. But Lao Tzu had to go out. He used
to go on his buffalo, moving from one village to another. I have simply
followed his advice – I never go outside my room.</p><p>Little Hasya lives in Lao Tzu. Other kids ask her, “Do you see Osho
sometimes moving in the house?” but she has not seen me yet, so what can
she say?</p><p><br></p><p>I am just living in my room, and you have all come from different
corners of the world. It is a miracle! Why have you come? And many more
are on the way; they will be reaching soon. This place is going to
become a tremendous force in the world, a transforming force in the
world. It is going to become a spiritual explosion – but we are not to
fight with anybody and we are not to struggle with anybody.</p><p><br></p><p>I have no political leanings. I am utterly against politics. Yes, the
old has to cease for the new to be – but the old has to cease WITHIN
YOU, then the new will be there. And once the new is within you the new
is infectious, contagious; it starts spreading into other people.</p><p><br></p><p>Joy is contagious! Laugh, and you see others start laughing. So is it
with sadness: be sad, and somebody looking at your long face suddenly
becomes sad. We are not separate, we are joined together, so when
somebody’s heart starts laughing many other hearts are touched –
sometimes even faraway hearts.</p><p>You have come from such faraway places; somehow my laughter has
reached to you, somehow my love has reached to you. Somehow, in some
mysterious way, my being has touched your being and you have come here
against all the difficulties. A thousand and one difficulties are being
created, and they will be created more and more. Although I am not
struggling against anybody, but still, those who are in power ARE afraid
because they cannot think that there can be a man who has no political
leanings. They cannot believe that there can be a man who can attract
thousands of people</p><p><br></p><p>and will not use the power of these people to attain to some
political powers, to some political status. They cannot believe it! How
can they believe it? They can only understand the way they can
understand.</p><p><br></p><p>So the politicians are afraid and they are creating every kind of
barrier, but that is not going to hinder anybody. In fact, that is going
to help me tremendously! It will become a challenge for all courageous
people. It may prevent a few cowards – and it is good if they are
prevented because they will not be of any use here. In fact, it will be
a kind of screening: only the people who can be benefitted by me will be
reaching here. So it is good; whatsoever hindrances are being created
are good.</p><p>But I am not teaching you to struggle against anything. Whenever you
struggle against anything you become a reactionary, because it is a
reaction; you become obsessed with something, you are against it. And
then there is every possibility that the thing you are against will
dominate you – maybe in a negative way, but it will dominate you.</p><p><br></p><p>Friedrich Nietzsche was very much against Jesus Christ. But my own
analysis of Friedrich Nietzsche is that he was too much impressed by
Jesus Christ, just because he was against him. He was obsessed; he was
really trying to become a Jesus Christ in his own right. His great book,
THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA, is an effort to create a new gospel. The
language he uses, the metaphors he uses, the poetry he uses, certainly
reminds one of Jesus Christ, and he was very much against him. He never
missed a single point – if he could condemn Jesus, he would immediately
condemn, but one is reminded again and again of Jesus He was
obsessed.</p><p><br></p><p>When he became mad, in the last phase of his life, he even started
signing his letters as ‘Anti-Christ Friedrich Nietzsche’. He could not
forget Christ even when he became mad. First he would write ‘Anti-
Christ’ and there he would sign. You can see the obsession, the deep
jealousy of Jesus that dominated him his whole life. It destroyed his
immense creativity. He could have been a rebel, but he reduced himself
to a reactionary. He could have brought something new to the world, but
he could not. He remained obsessed with Jesus.</p><p><br></p><p>I am not against anything or anybody. I don’t want you to be free
FROM something, I simply want you to be free. See the difference:
freedom from is never total; that ‘from’ keeps it entrapped with the
past. Freedom from can never be real freedom. Neither can freedom For
ever be real freedom; that is a search for a new slavery. And this
freedom from and freedom for almost always go together as two sides of
the same coin.</p><p>What I teach is simple freedom, neither from nor for, just freedom;
neither against the past nor for the future, but just to be in the
present.</p><p>The fifth question:</p><p><br></p><p>OSHO, I AM GETTING ON SEVENTY-.FIVE, YET I HESITATE TO TAKE SANNYAS.
WHY?</p><p><br></p><p>Ram Sarandas,</p><p><br></p><p>SEVENTY-FIVE is nothing! Morarji Desai is eighty-four and he is not a
sannyasin yet. And J.B. Kaplani is ninety-three and he is not a
sannyasin yet. And Ravishankar Maharaj is ninety-five and he is not a
sannyasin yet. Compared to these people, you are in the prime of your
life. Enjoy it! Forget all about sannyas! Why be bothered with it?
Seventy-five? You are almost young!</p><p><br></p><p>“You are heading for a broken marriage,” warned a friend of the
75-year-old man who had just taken a 21-year-young luscious blonde as
his bride..”I’m warning you, the difference in ages will be the cause of
your separation.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What would you suggest?” asked the old groom.</p><p><br></p><p>“As soon as you get back from your honeymoon trip,” the friend
advised, “fix up a room in your place</p><p>and take in a boarder.”</p><p><br></p><p>It sounded like a wise policy to the old man, so he decided to try it
out.</p><p><br></p><p>After a time, the friend came by to visit and was cordially received
by the elderly bridegroom.</p><p><br></p><p>“And how’s the little bride?” the friend asked cautiously.</p><p><br></p><p>“Couldn’t be better!” the old man answered. “She is in the family
way.” “Looks like my plan worked after all! And how is that boarder of
yours?” “Fine!” explained the old man. “And, by golly, she’s also in the
family way!”</p><p>Seventy-five? This is the time to fool around! And you are thinking
of sannyas, Ram Sarandas? Wait! Wait at least until you are a
hundred.</p><p>Great-great-grandma studied the newborn baby with obvious
satisfaction. “If my memory doesn’t fail me,” she cackled, “it’s a
boy!”</p><p>At least wait up to that point when you cannot recognize who is a boy
and who is a girl – then sannyas!</p><p>That has been the ancient way, Ram Sarandas. In India people used to
take sannyas only when they were of no worth at all. People used to go
to sannyas only when life was really finished, when there was nothing
left.</p><p>An eagle-eyed mortician noticed an old crone shuffling away from a
funeral service at his parlor and asked her how old she was.</p><p><br></p><p>“One hundred and one!” cackled the old lady proudly.</p><p>“Well, well!” said the mortician suavely. “Hardly worth going home,
is it?” Wait!</p><p><br></p><p>When it is hardly worth going home, then you can become a
sannyasin!</p><p><br></p><p>This has been the old way, and because of this, sannyas never became
the force it could have become.</p><p><br></p><p>But my sannyas is totally different: it has nothing to do with age.It
has something to do with youth rather than old age. The younger you are,
the more possibility there is of entering into my sannyas. Even those
who are old physically but young spiritually will feel attracted.towards
it – ONLY those will feel attracted towards it.</p><p><br></p><p>I am not teaching you escape from life. I am not teaching you the
other world. I am teaching you how to live this life with great
gratitude, with immense joy, with ecstasy. I am not anti-life. I am all
for life, because to me life is God. There is no other God.</p><p>You ask me, “I AM GETTING ON SEVENTY-FIVE, YET I HESITATE TO TAKE
SANNYAS.”</p><p><br></p><p>Why do you mention your age? The old idea in India is that after
seventy-five one should become a sannyasin. Age has nothing to do with
sannyas – not at least with MY idea of sannyas. The younger you are the
better, because you have more energy and more juice and more
aliveness.</p><p><br></p><p>And sannyas will need all the juice, all aliveness, because sannyas
is not a shrinking but an expansion. It is not getting out of life and
life’s context, running away from life and its complexities. My sannyas
is living in life, in all its complexities, and yet remaining simple,
yet remaining innocent.</p><p>I am teaching you something like a great paradox: to be in the world
and not be of it, to be in the world but not let the world be in
you.</p><p><br></p><p>Why should you hesitate? The old sannyas certainly gives hesitation.
In fact, no intelligent person would go into the old way, because <span class=s7>it.is</span> so against nature, against life; only stupid
people can be victims of it. Hesitation is perfectly right if you are
thinking to become an old Indian sannyasin. Then hesitation is perfectly
right; that simply shows intelligence.</p><p>But if you are hesitating to become MY sannyasin, that simply shows
indecisiveness, not intelligence, because I am not telling you to leave
anything. You will be the same, in the same world; everything will be
the same. Just deep down, at the center of your being, a new quality
will be added. I don’t take anything from you, I give something to you.
I make you more, not less. A quality of meditativeness will be added to
you, a subtle fragrance of prayer will be added to you. You will become
more fragrant, more perfumed, so why hesitate?</p><p><br></p><p>You also ask me, “Why?” It must be a confusion, a confusion between
the old concept of sannyas and the new. This is troubling many Indians.
The very word ‘sannyas’, and the idea of the old sannyas arises with all
its connotations. And it is natural in a way, because at least for ten
thousand years the old idea has existed, and my new sannyas is only ten
years old. Against ten thousand years, ten years are nothing. Ten
thousand years’ conditioning has gone very deep into the Indian
mind.</p><p>So when Western people come, sannyas seems to be easy for them
because they don’t have the old idea. They simply understand what I am
saying. They have nothing to compare. They see the beauty of it, they
take a jump into it.</p><p><br></p><p>But Ram Sarandas, when Indians come, naturally, the old idea of
sannyas somehow lingers.</p><p><br></p><p>And I have deliberately chosen the name ‘sannyas’; I could have
chosen something else. I have deliberately chosen the orange color, the
ancient color of sannyas, for a certain reason: I want to destroy the
old idea completely, and this is the only way. I want to destroy the old
idea absolutely, and the only way is to create so many new sannyasins
that the old, few and far between sannyasins are completely lost in the
ocean of orange.</p><p><br></p><p>Ram Sarandas, it must be the old idea that is creating the
hesitation. Just try to separate the old and the new. My sannyas has
nothing to do with the old, it is an absolutely new concept. It is very
worldly and yet very godly.</p><p>The last question:</p><p><br></p><p>OSHO, LISTENING TO YOU, I HAVE DECIDED THAT I WILL NOT LEAVE ANY
STONE UNTURNED UNTIL I HAVE FOUND GOD. PLEASE HELP ME.</p><p>Mahendra,</p><p><br></p><p>YOU are certainly hearing me, but not listening. God is not a goal.
God has not to be achieved. The achieving mind is the only barrier to
God. It is not a question of your ‘leaving no stone unturned’. It is not
a question of will-power, it is a question of surrendering. Leave all
the stones unturned! Don’t turn even a single stone, please! Why disturb
the stones?</p><p><br></p><p>It is not a question of will, and you are thinking in terms of will.
That’s what has been told to you again and again: become a great
will-power, struggle, search, seek; only then can you find God. That’s
all nonsense. God is never found by seeking, but that’s how you have
been misunderstanding me.</p><p><br></p><p>Two men were sitting in the doctor’s office and after a while they
decided to talk. “I’m aching from arthritis,” said one man. “Glad to
meet you,” said the other. “I’m Willy from California.”</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what has happened between me and you. I am saying I am aching
from arthritis, and you say that you are Willy from California.</p><p>The town band was doing its best when someone in the audience called
the piano player a bastard. The leader’s baton beat a tattoo on the
music stand and the players became silent. “Who called my piano player a
bastard?” he demanded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Who called that bastard a piano player?” a voice in the rear of the
theatre yelled back.</p><p><br></p><p>Something like that is happening between me and you – I am saying one
thing, you are hearing something else.</p><p><br></p><p>I am not teaching the way of will, I am teaching the way of utter
will-lessness. I am teaching you not to become strong but to be
vulnerable. I am teaching you not the way of the male but the way of the
female. Be more feminine. Be more delicate, vulnerable.</p><p>A man who was driving across the continent put up for the night at a
rural hostelry. The view from his second storey window was lovely, he
thought: peaceful meadows and a beautifully kept lawn directly
below.</p><p><br></p><p>During the night however, there was a cloudburst and when the man
awoke, the ground had disappeared under water fully five feet high. This
was surprising enough, but then the man spotted something even more
unusual. A straw hat floated by, reached the boundary fence, turned and
floated back. Three times this phenomenon was repeated and the man
rushed to the proprietor with a hushed, “Do you see what I see?”</p><p>“Sure!” laughed the proprietor. “That’s Uncle Henry. Stubborn old
coot! He swore he was going to</p><p>mow that lawn this morning, come hell or high water!”</p><p><br></p><p>This is not the way to find God! In fact, you need not go anywhere
and you need not do anything to find God. God is already trying to find
you. You just stand still or sit still so He can find you. Wherever He
comes you are gone. He never finds you, or even if sometimes He finds
you, you are not there; you are somewhere else. You are always somewhere
else!</p><p><br></p><p>It is not a question of finding God from your side: God is in search
of you.</p><p>You please be quiet and still. Sometimes, doing nothing, sitting
silently, just waiting, and He will find you. He will certainly find
you. That’s how He found me; that’s how He has always found... It is not
that you reach Him, it is always He who reaches you.</p><p><br></p><p>Allow Him to reach you! And that is possible only when you are open,
surrendered, in deep trust... your heart becomes an open lotus.</p><p><br></p><p>C H A P T E R <span class=s9>13</span></p><p><br></p><p>T he gu es t i s i ns i de you</p><p><br></p><p>8 M a y 1 9 7 9 a m i n B u d d h a H a l l</p><p><br></p><p>THE GUEST IS INSIDE YOU, AND ALSO INSIDE ME;</p><p>YOU KNOW THE SPROUT IS HIDDEN INSIDE THE SEED.

FORGETTING DYING AND LOSS, THEY RISE ABOVE BOTH COMING IN AND GOING
OUT.</p><p>FRIEDRICH Nietzsche declared that God is dead and hence man is free.
That has been one of the most ancient arguments: if God is, man cannot
be free. How can man be free if God is? Then God is the master and man
is the slave. Then God decides, man has only to follow. Then God has
will and man has no will; man is only a plaything in the hands of God.
So either God is, or man is free. If man is free, there can be no God at
all.</p><p><br></p><p>Charvakas in ancient India, Epicurus in Greece, and then Nietzsche,
Marx, Diderot, Freud, Russell, Jean-Paul Sartre, they all have been
repeating the same argument again and again in different words. The
argument seems to be very appealing. The argument proposes freedom for
man: man Gan be free only if God is removed. Then there is nobody above
man. Then there is nobody to dominate man, nobody to decide for man. If
there is nothing higher than man, then freedom is absolute. But
howsoever appealing the argument, it is fundamentally wrong; it is based
on wrong premises.</p><p>The declaration that God is dead is in a sense true: the false god,
the man-made God, is certainly dead. The god of the temples and the
churches and the synagogues and the mosques and the gurudwaras is
certainly dead. The god that man has imagined in his own image, the god
that man has made according to his own wishes, the god that is nothing
but a projection of man’s mind and desires, that god certainly is
dead.</p><p><br></p><p>But that god had really never existed; it is dead because it has
never existed in the first place. And it is good that the man-made god
is dead, because when the artificial is removed the natural can sprout.
When the false ceases the true can explode. The untrue MUST cease for
the truth to be.</p><p><br></p><p>I look at atheism with great respect, because it removes the false.
It has a great work to do. Its work is not against God; its work really
is for God, because it destroys all man-made idols of God. And then, in
that emptiness, the time God can become manifest, can be revealed.</p><p><br></p><p>All the great saints have been against the false god. They will agree
perfectly with Nietzsche, Freud, Jean-Paul Sartre. Of course, they will
agree for a totally different reason: not that the true God is dead, not
that the true God can ever be dead. To say that God is dead is a
contradiction in terms if by God you mean the true God, the God ‘that
which is’. It is a contradiction in terms because God is nothing but
life, and how can life be dead? It goes on and on, it is an unending
process. Life is a pilgrimage with no beginning and no end; God is
another name for life.</p><p><br></p><p>Those who know, they know God as the fragrance of life, the perfume
of existence, the very ground of being. For them, God is not a concept,
not a theory, not a hypothesis. For them, God is an existential
experience. For them God is not separate from man, for them God is man’s
innermost core.</p><p><br></p><p>Hence how can man’s freedom and God be antagonistic? Without God
there would be no freedom, because without God there would be no man.
Without God there would be no inner core to your being. Without God you
would be hollow; you wouldn’t have any meaning, any significance.
Without God you would be just accidental, a plaything of circumstances.
With God you have a certain significance, some meaning, some poetry.</p><p>With God you are free because God is your freedom. God gives you
space to grow; God is the space to grow in. Because there is something
higher, you can grow, you can reach for it, but the higher is not
separate from you. The higher is nothing but your own depth trying to
manifest itself. The higher is not something like a goal to be achieved.
It is more like something which is already there and has only to be
recognized. The height and the depth are one and the same. Your
innermost core is also the innermost core of the whole existence.</p><p><br></p><p>To think of God and man is wrong. God is man fulfilled, man is God on
the way. Man is the journey, God is the reaching, the arrival. Man is
like a seed and God is like a flower... one chain of growth.</p><p>God is not to be worshipped but realized. There is no need to make
temples for God. You have to learn how to look within you. The temple is
already there: your body is the temple! That’s what Kabir goes on saying
again and again: your body is the temple. God has already chosen it as
its abode.</p><p><br></p><p>God is already in you, God exists as you. Hence there is no question
of any conflict between you and God; there cannot be. Without God you
would be just a flower without fragrance. Without God you would be a
temple without any deity, empty. Without God you would be just pure
accident, with no significance at all. It is only with God that you
become part of the great symphony of existence, that you become
something which is needed, utterly needed; that without you existence
will miss something, that without you existence will be less.</p><p><br></p><p>God is not an ideal as we have been thinking down the ages. And it is
good that that God is dead; now we can declare the birth of a new God.
Now we can declare the true God. The true God is always your
interiority, your subjectivity.</p><p><br></p><p>Jean-Paul Sartre, one of the most important atheists of this age,
says that we cannot allow God to exist because His existence reduces us
to objects. He becomes the subject – He is omniscient, He goes on
looking at us, and because He looks at us and we cannot look at Him, we
are reduced to objects, things, commodities.Whenever you look at a thing
you cannot look at its interiority, you can look only at its outer core.
By looking, you reduce everything to a thing.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why in all the cultures, in all the societies down the ages,
looking at somebody for a certain period is thought to be unmannerly.
For almost two or three seconds you can look and there will be no
objection, that is casual; you are passing by and you look at a person,
just a casual look, a glance. But if you stare it is offensive. Why? Why
is looking at a person for too long offensive? It reduces him into an
object: you become the seer and he becomes the seen. And who are you to
reduce him into an object? It is offensive!</p><p><br></p><p>Jean-Paul Sartre also says that that is one of the reasons why lovers
always go on fighting, because they both go on looking at each other,
reducing each other into things, and nobody likes it. The man does not
like to be reduced into a thing, neither does the woman like it. And
they are lovers so they stare at each other – it is offensive; even in
love it is offensive. Deep down somewhere your being revolts against
it.</p><p>Women are far more sensitive, naturally. They are more graceful. When
they are making love they close their eyes; they don’t reduce the man
who is making love to them into an object. Man is a little crude: he
likes to see while he is making love. Even while he is making love he
wants to see, he would like to keep the light on. And there are
extremists also who would like it to be photographed, so they can make
an album and later on they can look at it.</p><p><br></p><p>But the woman feels offended. Certainly she is more sensitive, and
her sense of propriety is far more refined than the sense of man. You
kiss a woman, she immediately closes her eyes – she gives you the
freedom of being a subject.</p><p>Jean-Paul Sartre has some truth in his statement that lovers are
always in conflict because they reduce each other into things, and
nobody wants to be a thing. Then what to say about God? – He reduces the
whole humanity, all beings, into things. He is the eternal subject and
we are objects.</p><p><br></p><p>Hence Sartre says we cannot allow God to exist. Even if He is, He has
to be killed, He has to be destroyed.</p><p>There have been thinkers like Immanuel Kant, Schiller, Hegel, who
say: If there is no God He has to be invented, because without God man
will lose all significance. And they are also right: even if there is no
God he has to be invented, for man’s sake. It is better to have an
invented God than not to have any. At least He will give an appearance
of significance to life, a certain rhythm. The noise will start looking
at least like music. The accidental will not be accidental any more,
some meaning will arise. Hence they say if there is no God, He has to be
invented.</p><p><br></p><p>And on the other pole, Jean-Paul Sartre, Friedrich Nietzsche, Sigmund
Freud say: Even if there is God, He has to be killed, because if He
remains man is reduced into an object. Man loses all freedom, man loses
all will. But both are wrong, because both are thinking in terms of God
as if God is the other.</p><p><br></p><p>Kabir says – just as all the mystics of all the ages have been saying
– God is not the other. He is you. He is your inside. He is your
subjectivity, so how can He reduce you into an object? He is not
separate, so how can He take your freedom away? He need not be invented
because He is already there. And He need not be killed, because in
killing Him you will be simply committing suicide – and that is
impossible; nobody can commit suicide. You can drop one body, you will
immediately enter into another womb. Suicide is impossible. You can
pretend the game of committing suicide but you can never succeed in it,
because nothing can be destroyed. Not even a grain of sand can be
destroyed.</p><p><br></p><p>Physicists say there is no possibility of destroying anything.
Neither can something new be created nor can something existent be
destroyed. If this is so even about a grain of sand, what to say about
the being of man?’ – that is the highest flowering – how can it be
destroyed?</p><p>Life is eternal. Life is immortal. It changes forms, certainly, just
like the waves in the ocean go on changing but the ocean remains. Bodies
come and go, minds come and go, but your innermost witness remains
always there. And that witness is God.</p><p><br></p><p>Hegel, Kant, Schiller, are wrong; so is Freud, so is Nietzsche, so is
Jean-Paul Sartre. They both accept the same premise: that God is the
other. And God is not the other. God is your very soul. God is already
in you... just a little alertness.</p><p><br></p><p>Wake up and see! You need not wait for the Guest. The Guest has
already arrived in the very being of the host. The Guest is found in the
host.</p><p><br></p><p>THE GUEST IS INSIDE YOU – says Kabir –</p><p><br></p><p>AND ALSO INSIDE ME;</p><p><br></p><p>YOU KNOW THE SPROUT IS HIDDEN INSIDE THE SEED.</p><p><br></p><p>Exactly like that – just as in the seed the sprout is hidden – in you
is hidden God. Of course if you cut the seed, if you dissect the seed,
you will not find the sprout – or will you? You can cut the seed; you
will not find anything at all: no sprout, no foliage, no branches, no
flowers, no fruits, nothing at all, because the seed is the unmanifest.
It needs growth, it needs a right soil, it needs a gardener.</p><p>It needs great art to help the unmanifest to become manifest; to
bring that which is hidden to the world, great skill is needed.</p><p>Buddha has called religion nothing but skill, art, UPAYA, a
methodology – a methodology to bring the unseen into the world of the
seen, to bring the invisible into the world of the visible. In the seed
the flowers are there, but they are invisible. A proper context will be
needed where they can become visible.</p><p><br></p><p>Exactly in the same way, God is in you; you are the seed of God. God
is not to be worshipped but revealed. You have to grow and become a God!
You are not to seek and search for a God somewhere, already ready-made.
You have to grow; growth is religion. You have to grow into a God. You
are carrying the seed, you have to find a soil – you have to find a
buddhafield. You have to find a</p><p><br></p><p>gardener, a Master. You have to find a commune where many trees are
blooming, so that hope can arise in the heart of the seed that “Yes, if
other seeds can become trees, GREAT trees, why can’t I?”; so that
longing can arise in the heart, so the heart becomes aflame, afire,
athirst. In that very thirst, in that very longing, the seed has started
moving towards the flowers.</p><p>It is a long journey, but an inner journey. You can make the whole
journey by sitting silently, not going anywhere, because the going has
to be something inner. It is not in space, it is in consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>The original is:</p><p><br></p><p>SAHAB HAM MEN SAHAB TUM MEN, JAISE PRANA BIJ MEN.</p><p>The Master is in me and the Master is in you</p><p><br></p><p>just as life is hidden in the seed.</p><p><br></p><p>It is because of too many analytical approaches, too many logical
approaches, that we are missing God. It is because of too much
scientific upbringing. A kind of ‘scientism’ has arisen in the world, a
very vulgar religion; it is not scientific really, it is scientism.
People have started believing in science as if it is a religion. It is
just a very crude methodology to know about matter. It is so crude that
it cannot grasp the subtler aspects of life.</p><p>If you behave in a crude way with the seed – with a knife you can cut
it you will simply be destroying its possibility. You will be killing
it. By cutting it you will not find anything in it, and of course then
you can say, “Because I don’t find anything in it – no life, no flower,
no fragrance – hence it is decided that there is no flower, no
fragrance, no fruit, no trees. They are all just imagination.”</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what science has done to religion: it dissects and cannot find
the subtle. Through dissection the subtle cannot be found, never, never.
It dissects man and cannot find the soul. The soul is unavailable to
dissection. You will find the bones and the blood and the marrow and
everything; all that which is measurable you will find if you dissect
the body of man. But you will not find the immeasurable – and that’s
what really is valuable.</p><p><br></p><p>SAHAB HAM MEN SAHAB TUM MEN...</p><p><br></p><p>Kabir says: And remember, God is not separate from man. He is in me,
He is in you, He is in everybody. Wherever life is, God is. God is
synonymous with life. He is in the trees and in the birds and in the
animals. Wherever life is, God is. Howsoever rudimentary the life may
be, God is there.</p><p>... JAISE PRANA BIJ MEN.</p><p><br></p><p>God is hidden in everything, in every being, as life is hidden, GREAT
life is hidden, in the seed. Unimaginable it is! If you just see the
seed, you cannot believe that a great tree is going to be born out of
it, a great tree which will whisper with the clouds, a great tree which
will try to reach to the stars, a great tree which will become shelter
for hundreds of travellers, a great tree which will become a nest for
thousands of birs, a great tree with all the colors, green and red and
gold. Looking at a seed, you cannot imagine it. Even if you look through
a great microscope you will not find it there. It IS there, and yet you
cannot find it there.</p><p><br></p><p>Why is it so? It is there, but not yet manifest. find a right soil,
help it to become manifest. Help the seed to die!</p><p><br></p><p>When the disciple comes to the Master, he comes to die. the disciple
is one who decides to die in the Master. In that very death is
resurrection. In that very death, life starts manifesting itself in its
multi- dimensionality. Dying, one attains to higher life; one has to go
on dying on lower planes. the moment you die on the lower plane, you
assert from the higher, and there are planes and planes.…</p><p>Go on dying always to the plane you find yourself to be in, so that
you can move to the higher. You have to leave the lower step, only then
can you reach to the higher step. If you cling to the lower you cannot
reach to the higher.</p><p><br></p><p>THE GUEST IS INSIDE YOU, AND ALSO INSIDE ME;</p><p>YOU KNOW THE SPROUT IS HIDDEN INSIDE THE SEED. WE ARE ALL STRUGGLING;
NONE OF US HAS GONE FAR. LET YOUR ARROGANCE GO, AND LOOK AROUND
INSIDE.</p><p><br></p><p>The mind is very arrogant: without knowing a thing, it starts
proving, this way or that way. There are arrogant atheists who try to
prove that there is no God, and there are arrogant theists who try to
prove that there is God. Proving or disproving, it is the same mind and
the same arrogance. Neither is the theist religious nor the atheist.</p><p>The religious person is one who is not arrogant. The religious person
is one who is not trying to prove for or against, who is not trying to
come to some conclusions through reasoning; one who is available, open,
ready to see. Unclouded are his eyes – unclouded because he has no
ideas, no ready-made formulas; unclouded because he has no already
arrived at conclusions; unclouded because he has no a priori approach;
unclouded because he is innocent, childlike, ready to see but with no
prejudice, with no ideology.</p><p><br></p><p>The religious person is never a Hindu or a Mohammedan or a Christian
or a Parsee. A religious person is simply a vulnerable consciousness, an
open heart. The religious person is a quest, an enquiry – and enquiry
cannot begin with already arrived at conclusions.</p><p>If you have already come to a conclusion your enquiry is finished.
You are dead! If you already know that God is, without knowing, if you
already know that God is not, without knowing, you are being simply
stupid – not religious or theist or atheist, but just simply stupid.</p><p>The real enquirer will say, “I don’t know.” Unless he has realized he
will not say, “I know.” Even when he has realized, the emphasis will not
be on ‘I’, but on knowing. To be exactly true, he will not say “I know”;
he will say, “Knowing has happened.”</p><p>WE ARE ALL STRUGGLING; NONE OF US HAS GONE FAR.</p><p>Neither the believer nor the unbeliever – nobody has gone far. They
are all tethered to their conclusions, and hence the struggle is
absolutely unnecessary and foolish. We are struggling because we are
tethered.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard an ancient parable.…</p><p>A few friends were celebrating the birthday of one of their most
beloved friends. They drank, they ate, they danced. It was a full-moon
night. They went to the river, but the boatman had gone. It was late
night, the full moon in the sky, the river... beautiful... the silence.
And they were all drunk, singing, dancing, in a really joyous mood. They
entered the boat, they took the oars in their hands, they started moving
to the other shore. For hours and hours they thought they were
travelling.</p><p>When it was getting closer to the morning and the cooler winds
started blowing, they came to their senses a little bit. One of them
said, “We must have travelled at least a few miles. We have been in the
boat the whole night. Somebody should get out and see where we have
come. Now it is time to go back home.”</p><p>So one of them got out and started laughing madly. The others asked,
“What is the matter?” He said, “You all come out and see what is the
matter.”</p><p>They all got out, and they all started laughing and rolling on the
bank, because they had forgotten one thing, a simple thing: the boat was
tethered to the bank with a chain. The whole night they struggled and
they were thinking that they were travelling, but they had not gone even
an inch. They had remained on the same spot.</p><p>This is the situation of all those who go on struggling in their
minds, who go on arguing, reasoning and thinking that they are coming
closer and closer to truth.</p><p>If you are tethered to your prejudices... And everybody is tethered,
because the society never allows a child to grow without prejudices.
Every society tries to contaminate the child, to pollute his mind, to
condition him, to hypnotize him. That’s why you find Hindus and
Mohammedans and Christians, and you don’t find human beings anywhere.
The world is ugly because human beings are missing. The world would be a
blissful place, a paradise, if Mohammedans, Hindus, Jains, Buddhists,
would disappear and only human beings would be left.</p><p>A child is born as a human being, but we condition him. we stuff his
mind with beliefs. And the child is very impressionable; he is very,
very soft. You can engrave anything on his mind and he will have to
carry it for his whole life – unless he is very intelligent and
fortunate enough to drop all the nonsense that the parents and the
society have given to him. Unless he is like a Buddha or a Jesus or a
Kabir or a Nanak, he is bound to remain tethered to the prejudices given
to him. For his whole life he will struggle and he will never reach
anywhere. And when death will come he will not be able even to laugh; he
will have to cry because his whole life has been a wastage, a sheer
wastage, a great opportunity lost.</p><p>Get rid of all your prejudices. Get rid of all that you have not
known and others have given to you. Get rid of all your knowledge. If
you really want to know one day the first thing is not to get rid of
ignorance, the first thing is to get rid of knowledge. Knowledge is
ignorance, the real ignorance. If you get rid of knowledge, ignorance is
innocence.</p><p>Then you are left with just an enquiry, a question mark in your
heart: “Who am I? What is this existence?” And because you don’t have
any conclusion, you can start moving. Because you are not tethered any
more to any prejudice, you can enquire, you can search, you can
seek.</p><p><br></p><p>WE ARE ALL STRUGGLING; NONE OF US HAS GONE FAR.</p><p><br></p><p>We have not been able to go far because of an unnecessary struggle.
The original is:</p><p>MAT KAR BANDA GUMAN DIL MEN, KHOJ DEKH LE TAN MEN!</p><p><br></p><p>We have become too arrogant in the head. The head is full of holy
cowdung, full of bullshit.</p><p>Scriptures, philosophies, ideologies are all just rubbish, because
you have not known them. You have been made into a parrot.</p><p><br></p><p>MAT KAR BANDAGUMAN DIL MEN...</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t be arrogant in the head, don’t be an egoist in the head. Don’t
think that you know. Don’t think that your scripture can supply you with
the truth. No Vedas, no Koran, no Bible can give you the truth. Truth
has to be achieved through individual effort.</p><p>Truth has to be achieved by everybody on his own; it is
untransferable. Buddha cannot give it to you. He knows, he has arrived,
but he cannot give it to you. Hence his last words, his departing words
to his disciples: “Be a light unto yourself.” The disciples were crying,
naturally; the Master was leaving. The Master had said goodbye to them.
He had said, “Now this body is tired, and I would like to leave it. My
work is finished.” They started crying. Some had lived with Buddha for
forty years, for thirty years. Their whole lives were permeated with his
presence, with his love and compassion, with his light.</p><p><br></p><p>Ananda, who had lived longest with him – almost fifty years, serving
him like a shadow, following him everywhere; not for a single day for
fifty years had he been away from Buddha – tears started rolling down
his cheeks. Buddha said, “Ananda, you, and crying? Why?”</p><p>And Ananda said, “I could not become enlightened while you were
alive. Now you are going, what will happen to me?”</p><p>Buddha laughed and said, “Maybe my presence was the hindrance. Now
you will become enlightened within twenty-four hours. You depended too
much on me. Although I was continuously telling you that I cannot give
it to you, nobody can give it to you, deep down you still carried the
hope, that ‘When he can, he will give it to me – at least to me, if not
to anybody else. I have been serving him for fifty years; can’t he see
that I have devoted my whole life, sacrificed my whole life? Finally,
one day, he will give me the key.’ You were hoping and hoping and
hoping, and I was telling you that all your hopes are futile: it is
untransferable. Not that I would not like to give it to you; I would
like to give it to everybody, to those who ask and to those who don’t
ask. If it were possible to give you the truth I would have already
given it. I would not have made you wait for fifty years. It is
impossible; it is untransferable. One has to know it, experience it in
one’s own being. It cannot be given from the outside. No scripture can
supply it, no Master can supply it.”</p><p><br></p><p>The Master can only provoke a great longing to seek and search. The
Master can only seduce. The Master can only convince you that your seed
carries infinite glories in it, that you are not just that</p><p><br></p><p>which you appear to be – you are far more – that you are an infinite
universe. The Master can only convince you by his presence that you are
God. By declaring himself a God he can convince you that you are also
Gods. SAHAB HAM MEN, SAHAB TURN MEN – the Guest is in me, the Guest is
in you. The Master can only convince you. He can trigger a process in
you, but he cannot give it to you.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha said, “Because you were depending and hoping, you missed. Had
you listened to me it would have happened long before. But now I say to
you: within twenty-four hours it will happen. Once I am gone, all your
hope will disappear. That is becoming a barrier.”</p><p><br></p><p>And exactly as Buddha had said, it happened: within twenty-four hours
Ananda was enlightened. The death of the Buddha was such a shock: his
whole life gone, and Buddha too, and now there was only dark night
ahead, death. The shock was so much, so shattering, that for the first
time he turned in. At last he heard what Buddha had been saying again
and again. At last he HAD to, because now the Buddha was gone and there
was nobody else to tell him to look in. He closed his eyes... wet with
tears were those eyes, but he closed his eyes for the first time. Up to
then, for fifty years, those eyes had been focused on Buddha. And Buddha
was so beautiful and so graceful, it was impossible to close your eyes
while Buddha was present with you in the same room, in the same place,
under the same shelter. Ananda used to just look at Buddha. Just to look
at him was such a joy, he had not ever meditated.</p><p><br></p><p>But now Buddha was gone, there was nothing else to see. Ananda closed
his eyes; for twenty-four hours he didn’t open his eyes. Somebody asked
him, “Why don’t you open your eyes? Tears are flowing, but why don’t you
open your eyes?”</p><p>He said, “Now there is nothing left to be seen. I have seen the
greatest, I have seen all that is worth seeing – I have seen the
ultimate glory. Now there is nothing to be seen. I will not open my eyes
UNLESS I HAVE SEEN MYSELF.”</p><p><br></p><p>He opened his eyes only when he had seen himself.</p><p><br></p><p>The Guest is within you, but you have to turn in. And we are too much
focused on the outside and on the futile. Somebody is leaning on his
scripture, reading, reading, cramming, and thinking that by knowing more
and more of the Vedas and the Bible and the Koran he will become
enlightened. You will become only burdened with knowledge!</p><p><br></p><p>WE ARE ALL STRUGGLING; NONE OF US HAS GONE FAR.</p><p><br></p><p>Why has none of us gone far? – because of the conclusions, ready-made
conclusions; because of borrowed knowledge. LET YOUR ARROGANCE GO...</p><p>Kabir says:</p><p><br></p><p>MAT KAR BANDA GUMAN DIL MEN, KHOJ DEKH LE TAN MEN!</p><p><br></p><p>Just let this arrogant mind go! Say goodbye to this arrogant mind.
See all that mind contains is worthless, and turn in. Look into your own
body... and He is there. Your body is the temple, He has already chosen
it; He abides there. And you go to Khasi, and you go to Kaaba, and you
go to Kailash. And you go on searching all over the earth, and this you
have been doing for many many lives, and you have not found Him; and He
is inside you.</p><p><br></p><p>Another ancient parable...</p><p><br></p><p>When God made the world he used to live in the marketplace, on M.G.
Road. Of course, it was very difficult to live there in the marketplace,
because people would come at any hour, odd hours. Even in the middle of
the night they would start knocking: “My child is ill. I don’t have any
employment. What kind of world have you made? I am getting old, I am
weak. What kind of world have you made? Why is there so much
suffering?”</p><p>People were coming the whole day and the whole night, and they were
bringing demands. And their demands were so contradictory that God was
going almost mad. One would come and say, “Tomorrow I need rains,
because I have sown the seeds in the garden and the rain is needed.” And
another would come: “Please, tomorrow let there be sun, no clouds, no
rains; because I am doing something which will be spoiled if it rains. I
need a clear, sunny day.”</p><p><br></p><p>Now what to do? Finally God called his council of advisors and asked,
“What should I do? I am</p><p>going crazy! Many times I start repenting: why did I create man? The
world was so beautiful.”</p><p><br></p><p>You know, the story is that whenever God made anything... He made the
trees, and He was so happy that He said, “Good, very good!” He made the
birds and the animals and He said, “Good, very good!” He appreciated His
own creation, He was so thrilled. But when He made man he didn’t say
anything; in fact He was at a loss. That’s why, after man, He stopped
creating anything. He has not created anything since then; that was the
last. He got so fed up with man that He stopped being a creator. He
simply abandoned the world.</p><p><br></p><p>He asked his advisors, “What should I do? I have created this
nuisance, and now they are torturing me. I would like a place to hide.
Where should I go?” Somebody suggested, “You go to Everest. These people
will not be able to reach there.”</p><p>For a moment He thought. He said, “No, you don’t know the future.
Just a few years” – and in God’s vision thousands of years or millions
of years are just a few – “there will be a man, Hillary. He will reach
and then the chain will start. Once the world comes to know that I live
on Everest, airplanes and helicopters and everything will start coming.
That won’t do, that won’t help much. For the time being, okay, but that
is not a solution. I need something permanent.”</p><p><br></p><p>Somebody suggested, “Then why don’t you go to the moon?”</p><p>He said, “You don’t know – sooner or later man is going to reach
there. He is going to reach to every</p><p>planet, to every star.”</p><p><br></p><p>Then an old advisor said, “Then the best thing I can suggest to you
is, why don’t you hide in man himself?”</p><p><br></p><p>And He loved the idea! And He said, “This is the right place, because
that is the last place man is going to. He will go everywhere, but he
will never go inside himself.”</p><p><br></p><p>Since then, God has been hiding there.</p><p>You need not go into the scriptures; all that you need is to go into
your own subjectivity. All that you need to go into is your own
consciousness. You have to become more conscious of your consciousness,
you have to become more aware of your awareness. You have to become so
aware of your awareness that everything else disappears. A point of
stillness comes where you are simply aware of your awareness and not
aware of anything else.</p><p><br></p><p>When awareness is the only content of your awareness and there is no
other content, that is the moment when the host disappears into the
Guest, when the Guest is found, when bliss descends on you.</p><p><br></p><p>LET YOUR ARROGANCE GO, AND LOOK AROUND INSIDE. THE BLUE SKY OPENS OUT
FARTHER AND FARTHER, THE DAILY SENSE OF FAILURE GOES AWAY,</p><p>THE DAMAGE I HAVE DONE TO MYSELF FADES, A MILLION SUNS COME FORWARD
WITH LIGHT,</p><p><br></p><p>WHEN I SIT FIRMLY IN THAT WORLD.</p><p><br></p><p>If you go in, things start happening, miracles start happening. And
you are entitled to miracles, miracles are your birthright. But because
you are always going into the outer, you become more and more of a
beggar.</p><p><br></p><p>The mind is a beggar, remember – howsoever arrogant, but it is a
beggar. The mind is a begging bowl and the beggar is never satisfied.
The beggar goes on asking for more and more and more.</p><p>One day a beggar knocked on the doors of a great king. By chance, the
king himself opened the door. He saw the beggar: the beggar was not an
ordinary beggar, he was almost luminous. He had such grace, such beauty,
such a mysterious aura, that even the king felt jealous. He asked, “What
do you want?” still pretending – “I have not taken any note of you” –
“What do you want?”</p><p><br></p><p>The beggar showed the king his begging bowl and he said, “I would
like it to be filled.” The king said, “That’s all? With what do you want
it to be filled?”</p><p>The beggar said “Anything will do, but the condition is that you have
to fill it; otherwise don’t try.”</p><p>It was a challenge to the king. He said, “What do you mean by it?
Can’t I fill this small begging bowl? And you don’t say with what.”</p><p><br></p><p>The beggar said, “That is irrelevant. Anything will do, even pebbles,
stones, but fill it! The condition is: I</p><p>will not leave the door if you start filling it; unless it is filled
I will remain here.”</p><p><br></p><p>The king ordered his prime minister to fill the begging bowl with
diamonds; he had millions of diamonds: “This beggar has to be shown that
he is encountering a king!” But soon the king became aware that he had
been deceived. The begging bowl was as extraordinary as the beggar, more
so in fact: anything dropped into it would simply be gone, would
disappear. It remained empty. The treasures were thrown into it, but
they all disappeared.</p><p>By the evening the whole capital had gathered. The king was now
becoming almost desperate: the diamonds finished, then the gold, and
then the gold was finished, then the silver, and then the silver was
finished.… The sun was setting, and the king’s sun had also set. His
whole treasure was empty, and the begging bowl was still the same,
empty, not even a trace! It swallowed all his kingdom. It was too
much!</p><p><br></p><p>Now the king knew that he had been trapped. He fell at the feet of
the beggar and said, “Forgive me. I was wrong to accept the challenge.
This begging bowl is not an ordinary begging bowl. You deceived me –
there is some magic in it.”</p><p>And the beggar laughed and he said, “There is no magic in it: I have
made it out of the skull of a man.”</p><p>The king said, “I don’t understand. What do you mean? If it is just
made out of the skull of a man, how can it go on swallowing my whole
kingdom?”</p><p>And the beggar said, “That’s what is happening everywhere: NOBODY is
ever satisfied. The begging bowl in the head always remains empty. It is
an ordinary skull, just like everybody else’s.”</p><p><br></p><p>But once you have looked in, once you have come down from the head,
once you have left the arrogance of the head and become humble in the
heart, a new world opens its doors to you.</p><p>THE BLUE SKY OPENS OUT FARTHER AND FARTHER.</p><p><br></p><p>You have a blue sky inside you far deeper and far vaster than the
outer sky, and far more beautiful. The outer sky is nothing compared to
the inner.</p><p>THE DAILY SENSE OF FAILURE GOES AWAY.</p><p><br></p><p>Once you look in, the daily sense of failure simply goes away,
evaporates.</p><p><br></p><p>Just look at your life: there is a daily sense of failure; every day
you know that again you are going to fail. The morning comes and you
know – another day of dragging – and the evening comes, and tired, you
go to sleep. One day is finished and your hands are still empty and your
heart is still empty. Nothing has been achieved and one day is lost. And
you know tomorrow it is going to be repeated again because this has been
so in the past, not only in this life but in many, many lives. Days come
and go, years come and go, lives come and go, and you remain as empty as
ever, no fulfillment, no contentment.</p><p><br></p><p>But Kabir says: As you look in, as you turn in... a
hundred-and-eighty-degree turn is needed. Right now you are keeping
yourself at the back, and the world is in front of you. A
hundred-and-eighty- degree turn is needed... when the world is at the
back of you and you are facing yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what meditation is all about: looking into your own being,
into the well of your own being. THE DAILY SENSE OF FAILURE GOES AWAY,
THE DAMAGE I HAVE DONE TO MYSELF FADES.</p><p><br></p><p>And the damage is great, because for lives we have been doing it to
ourselves. We have been killing ourselves, wounding ourselves in a
thousand and one ways. We are all wounds and nothing else! Each pore of
our being has become a wound, and each cell of our being hurts. What are
you? – just think for a moment, watch for a moment – a great agony, a
great sigh, a great pain of failure, of boredom, of meaninglessness. But
still one goes on dragging in the hope that maybe that which has not
happened yet may happen tomorrow... but tomorrow never comes.</p><p><br></p><p>If you look in,</p><p><br></p><p>THE DAMAGE I HAVE DONE TO MYSELF FADES, A MILLION SUNS COME FORWARD
WITH LIGHT...</p><p><br></p><p>All darkness disappears. At the innermost core is the source of
light, as if millions of suns have suddenly come in.</p><p><br></p><p>... WHEN I SIT FIRMLY IN THAT WORLD.</p><p><br></p><p>If you can sit firmly, unwavering, inside yourself, in that world all
is light, nothing is dark, and all is life, nothing is death, and all is
eternal and nothing is time.</p><p>That moment is the moment, the momentous moment, when the Guest
appears. Those millionsof suns simply declare His coming, that He is
very close by. The disappearing sense of failure... and suddenly a
feeling of being healed; those are symptoms that the Guest is close by.
His very presence is a healing force. He makes you whole; just by His
presence you are whole. When you start feeling a well-being, a
wholeness, when your agony starts disappearing and instead of agony
ecstasy arises in you, know well that God is close by. Listen
attentively... you will hear His footsteps coming closer and closer and
closer.</p><p>I HEAR BELLS RINGING THAT NO ONE HAS SHAKEN.</p><p><br></p><p>And Kabir says: I am hearing some strange music, as if bells are
ringing, but nobody is shaking them.</p><p><br></p><p>The sound of one hand clapping, ANAHAD NAD, unstruck music... All
other music is struck music; you have to strike the strings of the
instrument. It is only by striking the strings that the music arises. It
is violence – playing on a guitar or on a sitar, you are being a little
violent. It is a kind of coercion;</p><p><br></p><p>you are forcing the instrument to release the music. It is a kind of
fight. And there is duality: the musician and the musical instrument in
conflict, fighting. It can’t be great music, it can’t be eternal music.
Once the musician stops fighting the music will disappear. It is caused,
so it cannot be eternal.</p><p>But when you turn in, there is light and there is music – music which
is eternal. It is simply there, it is not a created phenomenon.</p><p>ANAHAD GHANTA BAJE MRIDANGA, TAN SUKH LEHI PYAR MEN. ANAHAD GHANTA
BAJE MRIDANGA...</p><p>... Something strange is happening, Kabir says. Some bells are
ringing, and nobody is ringing them.</p><p>Some music, some melody, is there, but I can’t see anybody creating
it.</p><p><br></p><p>This music is known by the Christian mystics as ‘the Word’, LOGOS.
Nanak calls it NAM, Lao Tzu calls it Tao, Buddha calls it DHAMMA. But to
call it music is the best, to call it NAD is the best, because it is a
tremendous orchestra. All the planes of existence are involved in it. It
is not only that the soul is full of music: once you have heard the
inner music, your mind is full of it, your heart is full of it, your
body is full of it, all your layers of being are full of it. Once known,
not only inside do you hear it, it is outside too. In the song of birds
you will hear it, and in the wind passing through the trees you will
hear it, and in the waves striking on the rocks you will hear it. In
sound you will hear, in silence you will hear.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, the greatest music in the world is nothing but an echo of
the inner music. Whenever a musician comes closer to that music, great
music is born. Only very few have reached close to it: a Tansen, a Baiju
Bawara, a Beethoven, a Mozart, a Wagner. Only very few have come close
to it, but whenever some music comes close to it, resembles it, it has
something great in it.</p><p><br></p><p>The modern trends in music are far away from it: they are more noisy,
less musical. Jazz and other music is more sexual, less spiritual. They
are loud. They keep your mind occupied, certainly; they are so loud that
you have to remain occupied.</p><p>People go on listening to the radio, to the television, at full
volume, as loud as possible, blaring, so that they need not think, so
that they need not be worried, so that they remain occupied. The noise
is so much, you cannot think – and they are tired of thinking, tired of
worrying. People are glued to their chairs for hours listening to just
stupid noise; it is not music at all.</p><p>Music, to be worthy of being called music, has to be meditative. If
it brings meditation to you, if it brings silence; if it fills you with
silence, if it reminds you of the soundless sound inside you, then only
is it real music. Otherwise it is a false coin.</p><p><br></p><p>I HEAR BELLS RINGING THAT NO ONE HAS SHAKEN, INSIDE LOVE THERE IS
MORE JOY THAN WE KNOW OF.</p><p>And Kabir says: This small word ‘love’ contains so much. We are not
aware of it. We are only</p><p>aware of the lowest expression of it, sex. We are not even aware of
the higher expression which</p><p><br></p><p>can be called love. And what to say about the highest, which is
called prayer? Love contains three dimensions: sex, love, prayer. And
unless your love has reached to the dimension of prayer you have not
known love. Sex is the lowest form, the animal form; love is the human
form, and prayer is the divine form.</p><p><br></p><p>Kabir says,</p><p><br></p><p>INSIDE LOVE THERE IS MORE JOY THAN WE KNOW OF.</p><p><br></p><p>Because inside love you can find God Himself. If prayer arises, God
is found. RAIN POURS DOWN, ALTHOUGH THE SKY IS CLEAR OF CLOUDS.</p><p><br></p><p>And Kabir says: I cannot describe what is happening inside me. Things
which are illogical, things which should not happen, are happening.
There are no clouds in the sky, and rains are pouring – rains of
nectar!</p><p><br></p><p>BIN PANI LAGI JAHAN BARSHA, MOTI DEKHI NADIN MEN.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t see any clouds anywhere! I don’t see water falling down, but
I am becoming full of nectar. I am being bathed in nectar; it is
showering on me!</p><p><br></p><p>THERE ARE WHOLE RIVERS OF LIGHT...</p><p><br></p><p>It is difficult to describe, hence these metaphors.</p><p>... RIVERS OF LIGHT.</p><p><br></p><p>THE UNIVERSE IS SHOT THROUGH IN ALL PARTS BY A SINGLE SORT OF
LOVE.</p><p><br></p><p>And now I see that the whole existence is joined together only by one
single thread: you can call that thread love and nothing else. The world
is a garland of millions of flowers, but running through all those
flowers is a thread that keeps it together: that thread is love.</p><p>It may have many manifestations. For example, the physicist will say
the earth has a certain power called gravitation. If you ask the
mystics, mystics like Kabir, they will say it is nothing but a very
lower form of love – because gravitation attracts, and all attraction is
love.</p><p><br></p><p>What keeps the universe together? Why does it not fall apart? There
must be something that is keeping it together, some force. That force
mystics call love. You can call it God, because love is God.</p><p><br></p><p>HOW HARD IT IS TO FEEL THAT JOY IN ALL OUR FOUR BODIES!</p><p>It is difficult in the beginning, because we are not accustomed to
dancing on such high planes. We are not accustomed to such pure air.
When you go to the mountains, if you move to the highest</p><p><br></p><p>peaks, you feel difficulty in breathing. You are not accustomed to
inhaling such pure air; you have become accustomed to inhaling the
impure air that surrounds the earth – and we have made it more and more
impure.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, scientists are at a loss. They cannot figure out how people
are managing to live, because in cities like New York, Los Angeles,
London, Calcutta, Bombay, the air is so polluted that man should not be
able to live in it. It is three times more polluted than scientists used
to think man is capable of tolerating – three times more! But man’s
adaptability is great; he can adapt to any kind of situation.</p><p><br></p><p>When people living in Bombay and Calcutta go to the Himalayas it is
hard; breathing is difficult – the air is so light and so pure.</p><p>Once it happened: a woman gardener went to sell her flowers in the
town. After selling her flowers, when she was going back, she met one of
her old friends, childhood friends. She asked the friend, “What are you
doing here?”</p><p><br></p><p>The friend said, “I have become a fisherman’s wife and I have come to
sell my fish.”</p><p><br></p><p>The gardener-woman requested her to stay at her garden at least for
one night, then in the morning she could go. The woman stayed. The
gardener and his wife both prepared a beautiful bed for her, of flowers.
But she could not sleep; she would turn and toss and turn. Finally they
asked, “What is the matter? Why can’t you sleep?”</p><p><br></p><p>She said, “It is because of these flowers. I know only one perfume –
that of fish. Bring my bag. Although now it is empty, but it has carried
fish for years. Sprinkle it with water and give it to me. If I keep it
close to my nose I may be able to fall asleep.”</p><p>And that’s how it happened – immediately she fell asleep!</p><p><br></p><p>One who knows only the smell of fish will find it difficult, at least
in the beginning, to live with flowers. Kabir is right; he says,</p><p>HOW HARD IT FEELS – how difficult –</p><p><br></p><p>TO FEEL THAT JOY IN ALL OUR FOUR BODIES!</p><p><br></p><p>The Eastern mystics have divided human bodies in many ways. They talk
about four bodies – and the fifth is you. The first body is the gross
body, the physical body. The second body is the vital body, more subtle
than the physical; you can call it the body made of electricity. There
is an electric current inside your body; that is your second layer. The
third body is even more subtle; you can call it the psychic body, the
body of your mind. The fourth is the subtlest; you can call it the body
of your consciousness.</p><p>And the fifth is not the body but the Guest. That fifth is called
bliss – ANANDAMAYA KOSHA, the body of bliss; it is the Guest. Once you
have seen the fifth, slowly slowly – although it is hard – the bliss
will descend to the fourth, to the third, to the second, to the
first.</p><p><br></p><p>And when it has descended to the first, the man is totally
enlightened. When he can feel the bliss even to the physical body, even
in his material form, when he can feel God even in matter, then the
perfection is achieved. Then enlightenment is total. Then there is no
longer anywhere to go: one has arrived home.</p><p><br></p><p>THOSE WHO HOPE TO BE REASONABLE ABOUT IT FAIL.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember, this is the world of the mysterium: if you try to be
reasonable about it you will fail. Hence whenever a sannyasin comes to
me with something mysterious, I immediately tell him not to talk about
it, not to analyze it, not to find explanations for it, because if you
become too reasonable about it you will miss. You will fail, the door
will close. One has to go into the mysterious without any reasoning. One
has to simply go in tremendous trust and love, with a deep prayer in the
heart, but in no way trying to be scientific, rationalistic,
analytical.</p><p><br></p><p>ANDH BHEDI KAHA SAMJHENGE, GYAN KE GHAR TE DURA...</p><p><br></p><p>Those who are too much obsessed with analysis, they are blind. They
will not be able to understand</p><p>– they will not be able to understand that which resides in you.
THOSE WHO HOPE TO BE REASONABLE ABOUT IT FAIL.</p><p>THE ARROGANCE OF REASON HAS SEPARATED US FROM THAT LOVE.</p><p><br></p><p>God is found not through reason but through love. God cannot be
proved by reason and cannot be disproved by reason either. But if you
love, if you love enough, love itself becomes the evidence – such
certain, such absolute evidence that even if the whole world says there
is no God it cannot shake your trust.</p><p><br></p><p>God is found in love, remember. Let me repeat it again and again: not
in reason but in love. Make your temple in love. Get out of the
obsession of reason.</p><p>WITH THE WORD ‘REASON’ YOU ALREADY FEEL MILES AWAY.</p><p><br></p><p>Reason can, at the most, think about and about; it goes round and
round in circles. It never penetrates the real core of your being. To
know about God is possible through reason, but to KNOW GOD IS possible
only through love. And remember, to know about God is not to know God.
To know about is acquaintance, not knowing. It is borrowed, it is
somebody else’s. And what can you know through reason?</p><p>Just think of a blind man thinking about light... Howsoever hard he
works, howsoever great a thinker he is, he will never be able to
understand what light is only by thinking. Impossible! Whatsoever
conclusion he will arrive at will be wrong, because light can only be
seen, not thought. And God can only be lived, not inferred.</p><p><br></p><p>HOW LUCKY KABIR IS...</p><p>But Kabir says: I am fortunate that I got out of the prison of
reason, that I escaped from the clutches of reason and I gathered
courage to follow love.</p><p><br></p><p>HOW LUCKY KABIR IS, THAT SURROUNDED BYALL THIS JOY HE SINGS INSIDE
HIS OWN LITTLE BOAT.</p><p><br></p><p>HIS POEMS AMOUNT TO ONE SOUL MEETING ANOTHER. THESE SONGS ARE ABOUT
FORGETTING DYING AND LOSS. THEY RISE ABOVE BOTH COMING IN AND GOING
OUT.</p><p><br></p><p>Kabir says: I am fortunate. The original is very beautiful:</p><p>BARHE BHAG ALMAST RANG MEN, KABIRA BOLE GHAT MEN...</p><p><br></p><p>I am infinitely fortunate because I am colored, dyed, in the madness
of love. BARHE BHAG ALMAST RANG MEN...</p><p><br></p><p>God has drowned me in His color of joy, bliss, celebration. He has
drowned me utterly into Himself Now I move like a mad poet, singing His
songs.</p><p>BARHE BHAG ALMAST RANG MEN, KABIRA BOLE GHAT MEN...</p><p><br></p><p>Now what I am saying is not coming from my head; I am pouring my
heart. In fact, now whatsoever is coming from me is not coming from me,
it is coming from Himself. He is speaking through me. I have become just
a flute in His hands; He is singing His song.</p><p>HANS-UBARAN DUKH-NIVARAN, AVAGAMAN MITE CHHAN MEN.</p><p><br></p><p>The moment I saw Him inside myself all misery disappeared, all
bondage disappeared. In fact, the moment I saw Him I saw that all my
misery was only a nightmare, that my bondage was only a dream, that I
had somehow fabricated it myself, that I had projected it, that I was
the creator of all of my hells.</p><p><br></p><p>HANS-UBARAN DUKH-NIVARAN...</p><p><br></p><p>The moment I saw Him, the bird was freed from the cage and all misery
disappeared.</p><p><br></p><p>... AVAGAMAN MITE CHHAN MEN.</p><p>And in a split second I was freed from the wheel of life and death.
HOW LUCKY KABIR IS, THAT SURROUNDED BYALL THIS JOY HE SINGS INSIDE HIS
OWN LITTLE BOAT.</p><p><br></p><p>HIS POEMS AMOUNT TO ONE SOUL MEETING ANOTHER.</p><p><br></p><p>My songs, Kabir says, are my orgasmic joy, the meeting, the ultimate
meeting of the soul with God, of the lover with the beloved; the merger
of the river into the ocean. My songs are orgasmic explosions.</p><p>THESE SONGS ARE ABOUT FORGETTING DYING AND LOSS.</p><p><br></p><p>And these songs are singing only one thing: that there is no loss and
there is no death. Forget all about it! Life is eternal, and life is
bliss. There is no birth and there is no death, no beginning, no end. It
is eternal pilgrimage, from one joy to another, from one peak of
orgasmic blissfulness to another peak. From peak to peak, from joy to
joy, it is an eternal journey.</p><p>THEY RISE ABOVE BOTH COMING IN AND GOING OUT.</p><p><br></p><p>And my songs are the songs of transcendence.</p><p><br></p><p>Once you have looked in, the outer and the inner are no more
separate; you become a witness of both. You see the outer, you see the
inner; you are neither and you are both.</p><p><br></p><p>These statements are known as ULATBASI – as if someone is playing on
the flute from the wrong</p><p>end, so illogical, so irrational<span class=s5></span>But Kabir
says, “What can I do? It is so. I can only state the fact. If the</p><p>fact is absurd, it is absurd.</p><p>Kabir will perfectly agree with the Christian mystic, Tertullian.</p><p><br></p><p>Somebody asked him, “Why do you believe in God?” And Tertullian said,
“I believe in God because</p><p>God is absurd – CREDO QUA ABSURDUM.”</p><p>Kabir would have danced listening to this. Yes, God is not a logical
hypothesis, it is supra-logical. No reasoning can prove it or.disprove
it. You will have to learn the art of love.</p><p><br></p><p>48I Be a lover, and you will find the Guest. Be a singer, and you
will find the Guest. Be a dancer, and you will find the Guest. Turn in,
tune in – He is waiting there for you.</p><p><br></p><p>C H A P T E R <span class=s9>14</span></p><p><br></p><p>I a m n o t a p e r s o n</p><p><br></p><p>9 M a y 1 9 7 9 a m i n B u d d h a H a l l</p><p><br></p><p>The first question:</p><p><br></p><p>PLEASE, OSHO, WHAT IS RECEPTIVITY?</p><p>Ananda Vandana,</p><p><br></p><p>RECEPTIVITY is a state of no-mind. When you are utterly empty of all
thought, when consciousness has no content, when the mirror reflects
nothing, it is receptivity. Receptivity is the door to the divine. Drop
the mind and be.</p><p><br></p><p>In the mind, you are miles away from being. The more you think, the
less you are. The less you think, the more you are. And if you don’t
think at all, those are the moments when being asserts itself in its
totality.</p><p>Receptivity simply means dropping the garbage that you go on carrying
in your head. And much garbage is there, utterly useless. The mind means
the past. Now the past is no more of any use; it has happened, and it is
never going to happen again, because in reality nothing ever
repeats.</p><p><br></p><p>Even when you think, feel, that this is the same situation, it is
never the same situation. Each morning is a new morning, and each
morning the sun that you encounter is the new sun. I am not talking
about the material sun. I am talking about the beauty, the benediction,
the blessing that it brings every day – it is so utterly new.</p><p><br></p><p>If you go on carrying pictures of the past, you will not be able to
see the new. Your eyes will be covered with your experiences,
expectations, and those eyes will not be able to see that which
confronts you.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s how we go on missing life: the past becomes a barrier,
encloses you, traps you, into something that is no more. You become
encapsulated in the dead. And the more you become experienced, grown-up,
the shell of the dead experience goes on becoming thicker and thicker
around you. You become more and more closed. Slowly slowly all windows,
all doors, are closed. Then you exist, but you exist alienated, you
exist uprooted. Then you don’t have a communion with life. You don’t
have a communion with the trees and the stars and the mountains. YOU
CAN’T have a communion, because a great China Wall of your past
surrounds you.</p><p>When I say become receptive, I mean become a child again.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember Jesus, who goes on saying to his disciples: Unless you are
like small children you will not be able to enter into my kingdom of
God. What he is saying is exactly the meaning of receptivity. The child
is receptive because he knows nothing; not knowing anything, he is
receptive. The old man is not receptive because he knows too much;
knowing too much, he is closed. He has to be reborn, he has to die to
the past and become a child again – not in the body, of course, but the
consciousness should always be like a child; not childish, remember, but
like a child, grown-up, mature, but innocent.</p><p><br></p><p>And that’s how one learns, learns the truth that is presented to you
every moment of your life, learns to know the Guest which comes and
knocks on your doors every moment, day in, day out, year in, year out.
But you are so surrounded by your own inner talk, by your own inner
procession of thoughts, that you don’t hear the knock.</p><p><br></p><p>Do you hear the distant call of the cuckoo? Do you hear the birds
chirping? This is receptivity. It is an existential state of silence,
utter silence; no movement, nothing stirs, and yet you are not asleep,
and yet you are alert, and yet you are absolutely aware. Where silence
and awareness meet, mingle and become one, there is receptivity.
Receptivity is the MOST important religious quality.</p><p>Become a child. Start, Vandana, functioning from the state of
not-knowing, and then silence will come of its own accord, and great
awareness. And then life is a benediction.</p><p>The second question:</p><p><br></p><p>OSHO, WHY ARE YOU SO MUCH AGAINST PHILOSOPHY?</p><p><br></p><p>Sudheer.</p><p><br></p><p>PHILOSOPHY means mind, philosophy means thinking, philosophy means
going away from yourself Philosophy is the art of losing yourself in
thoughts, becoming identified with dreams. Hence I am against
philosophy, because I am all for religion.</p><p><br></p><p>You cannot be philosophical if you want to be religious; that is not
possible. Religion is existential, philosophy is intellectual.
Philosophy is about and about, religion is direct. Philosophy is
thinking</p><p><br></p><p>about things you don’t know. Religion is a knowing, not thinking.
Philosophy depends on doubt,</p><p>because the more you can doubt the more you can think. Doubt is the
mother of thinking.</p><p><br></p><p>Religion is trust, because the more you trust the more there is no
need to think. Trust kills thinking; in trust, thinking commits suicide.
And when there is no thinking and trust pulsates in your being, in each
pore of your being trust permeates you, overwhelms you, you know what
is.</p><p>Philosophy TRIES to know, but never knows. Religion never tries to
know, but knows. Philosophy is an exercise in futility, of futility.
Yes, it talks about great things – freedom, love, God, meditation – but
it only TALKS about. The philosopher never meditates. He talks about
meditation, he spins and weaves theories, hypotheses, inferences ABOUT
meditation, but he never tastes anything about meditation. He never
meditates.</p><p><br></p><p>Hegel, Kant– these are philosophers; Buddha, Kabir– these are NOT
philosophers– Plato, Aristotle – these are philosophers; Heraclitus,
Plotinus – these are not philosophers, although in the books of
philosophy they are also called philosophers. They are not! To use the
word ‘philosopher’ for them is not right, unless you change the whole
meaning of the word. Aristotle and Heraclitus cannot be called
philosophers in the same sense. ]f Aristotle is a philosopher, then
Heraclitus is not; if Heraclitus is a philosopher, then Aristotle is
not.</p><p><br></p><p>I use a totally different word, ‘philosia’, instead of philosophy.
Philosophy means, literally, linguistically, love for knowledge.
Philosia means love for seeing, not only for knowledge. Knowledge is not
enough for the real enquirer; he wants to see. He does not want to
contemplate on God, he wants to encounter God. He wants to hold His hand
in his own hands, he wants to hug and kiss God! He is not satisfied with
the concept of God. How can the concept be of any help?</p><p>When you are thirsty you cannot be satisfied by the formula H20.
Howsoever right it is – that is not my concern, that is irrelevant –
right or wrong, the formula H20 cannot quench your thirst. You would
like water, and whether you know about H20 or not does not matter. For
millions of years man has been drinking water without knowing anything
about H20, and it has been perfectly satisfying.</p><p><br></p><p>Philosophy talks about water, religion drinks.</p><p><br></p><p>Talking about food is utterly stupid; you will have to prepare food.
You will have to eat, you will have to chew, you will have to digest.
Unless food becomes blood and bones and marrow, just talking about it is
not going to help. Hence I am against philosophy.</p><p><br></p><p>A woman was going to a doctor for a physical examination before her
fourth marriage. During the course of her examination the doctor was
startled to discover that she was still a virgin.</p><p>He demanded an explanation, “How can this be? You are preparing for
your fourth marriage and yet you are a virgin?”</p><p><br></p><p>“My first husband,” she replied, “I married for love, but as we were
leaving the church to go on our</p><p>honeymoon a tragic automobile accident occurred and he was
killed.”</p><p>“My second husband,” she continued, “I married for money. He was very
old, and so nothing ever happened between us.”</p><p><br></p><p>“My third husband,” she said, “was a great philosopher, and all he
could ever do was sit on the edge of the bed and tell me how good it was
going to be.”</p><p><br></p><p>Philosophy is pseudo-religion. Religion is true philosophy, because
religion leads you into the world of seeing, knowing, experiencing.</p><p>Exactly in that sense, Pythagoras has coined the word ‘philosophy’.
‘Sophy’ means SOPHIA; ‘philo’ means love: love for the ultimate wisdom.
That was the meaning given by the man who coined the word ‘philosophy’;
he was Pythagoras. He had travelled all over the world. He had been to
India, he had conferred with great mystics of the East, he had met
seers, enlightened people. It was he who first coined the word.</p><p>The original meaning is beautiful, but it got lost. When it fell into
the hands of the Greeks it started having a totally different meaning,
because the Greek mind is analytical, logical, rational. There are only
two types of minds in the world: the Greek and the Hindu. The Greek mind
is logical, the Hindu mind is illogical. The Greek mind is intellectual,
the Hindu mind is intuitive. The Greek mind has given birth to
philosophy and science, the Hindu mind has given birth to religion and
poetry.</p><p><br></p><p>The Greek and the Hindu exist in each person, because each person has
two minds in him. The brain is divided into two hemispheres, one is
Greek, another is Hindu. The left side of your brain is Greek, the right
side of your brain is Hindu. I am using the words ‘Hindu’ and ‘Greek’
metaphorically; don’t take it literally. Your left-side brain, which is
joined with your right hand, calculates, thinks, analyzes. Your
right-side brain, which is joined with your left hand, intuits, sings,
loves.</p><p>The religious person goes through an inner conversion from the Greek
to the Hindu. He moves from the left hemisphere to the right hemisphere.
All yoga and all other techniques of meditation are nothing but bridges
to take you from the left hemisphere to the right hemisphere. Once you
have reached the right hemisphere, the world of poetry, the world of
beauty, the world of love, opens its doors. Then God is. No proof is
needed, one simply feels. It is a feeling. It is a feeling in the guts.
One simply knows, for no other reason. And once you are centered in the
right hemisphere of your brain you can use the left hemisphere also, but
now it will function as a servant. And the left hemisphere is a good
servant but a bad master.</p><p><br></p><p>I am all for religion, because as I have seen, life is far, far more
than logic can comprehend. Life is so vast and your capacity to think is
so tiny. Life can be envisaged only through love, not through logic.</p><p>You will have to melt into existence. You will have to dance with it,
sing with it. Dancing with the trees in the wind, singing with the river
in the flood, having a communion with the clouds and the stars, you will
know what God is – not by thinking about Him.</p><p><br></p><p>The third question:</p><p>DEAR OSHO, I LOVE YOU. IN A SANNYAS MAGAZINE YOU SAID THAT YOU ARE
NOT A PERSON. THEN WHAT ARE YOU?</p><p>THE question is from Prem Bindiya. She is a small girl, ten years
old.</p><p><br></p><p>Bindiya, nobody is a person, although everybody believes that he is a
person. Nobody can be a person, because we are not separate. We are like
waves in the ocean. No wave has a personality. Yes, it has a form, but
it is not separate from the ocean. It is one with the ocean, you cannot
separate it from the ocean. You cannot take the wave away from the
ocean; it will disappear, it will not be a wave at all. It can only be a
wave in the ocean, with the ocean. It is not separate, it is part of the
dance of the ocean. It has no personality. Yes, it has a certain
individuality because it is different from other waves – unique it is! –
but it is not separate from the existence. And it is not separate from
other waves either, because they are all joined together in one
ocean.</p><p><br></p><p>When I say I am not a person, Bindiya, I simply mean I am not
separate from existence. I am one with the trees and one with the rocks
and one with the earth and one with the sky. I am a presence not a
person, and so are you, and so is everybody else. To believe in the
person is to believe in the ego.</p><p><br></p><p>And I can understand your question: this is how every child is being
brought up, for centuries. Your question is relevant.</p><p>You say, “I LOVE YOU. BUT IF YOU ARE NOT A PERSON, THEN HOW CAN I
LOVE YOU?” We</p><p>have been told that we can love only persons. The truth is just the
opposite: you cannot love the person. Persons can only fight, persons
can only be in conflict, because wherever two egos are, there is
conflict, a CONSTANT war – sometimes hot, sometimes cold, but the war
continues. Sometimes the warriors are tired so they maintain a certain
peace. Whenever they are back again and their energy is there again,
they start fighting.</p><p><br></p><p>You can see it happening with all kinds of lovers – a continuous
fight, a kind of intimate enmity, together and yet not together. Why is
this fight there? – because of two egos. Two persons are there, and of
course each person wants to dominate.</p><p>The ego is a deep desire to dominate. The ego is a deep desire that
says, “I am special, higher, bigger, greater than you.” And both are
trying to do the same. Conflict is necessary, inevitable. Love cannot
exist in such a state.</p><p><br></p><p>Love exists between two presences, not between two persons. Then
there is no conflict; there is great harmony, melody, music, rhythm.
When there are no more egos and both feel one with existence, they can
be one with each other.</p><p><br></p><p>Bindiya, love is possible only when you disappear. I have
disappeared, and my work here is now to help you to disappear too.</p><p><br></p><p>You ask me, ” THEN WHAT ARE YOU?”</p><p><br></p><p>I am not a person, I am a presence. I am a nobody. I am a kind of
nothingness, emptiness. The host has disappeared, and the disappearance
of the host has made the Guest appear. I am not, God is.</p><p><br></p><p>I cannot love you, but I am love. You can partake as much as you
like, you can drink out of me as much as you like. I cannot be in a
love-relationship with you because relationships exist only between
egos. But I can share. It will be a relating, not a relationship. It
will not be static, it will be</p><p><br></p><p>a flow. And it will have no motivation in it: I love you because I am
love. There is no motivation, no desire to get anything back from you.
It is enough that you accepted my love.</p><p><br></p><p>And I know this time, just two days ago, Bindiya had come to see me.
She has come back after a long time, and I could see great love in her
eyes. I had to call her close, I had to hold her face in my hands and
pour my love into her eyes. She is a small sannyasin, but because she is
small she is still capable of receiving. Because she is small, still
uncontaminated, still unpolluted, still uncorrupted, something natural
is still there.</p><p>And you are fortunate, Bindiya, that you have become a sannyasin so
early – now nobody will be able to corrupt you. Now you will become able
to protect yourself against this corrupted society, against all kinds of
corruptions. The church corrupts, the state corrupts, the educational
system corrupts. You have become a sannyasin at the right time. You will
be able to see all the games that are being played around you. You will
become more and more intelligent, more and more loving, and less and
less a person.</p><p><br></p><p>Those who are really with me are on the way of disappearing,
evaporating. Just as in the early morning sun the dewdrops start
disappearing... that is the way for the disciple to disappear when he is
in a close love-relationship with the Master.</p><p><br></p><p>The fourth question:</p><p>OSHO, WHY DID FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE DECLARE THAT GOD IS DEAD?</p><p><br></p><p>Narayana,</p><p><br></p><p>HE HAD to declare it, because God WAS dead. The God that had been
worshipped for thousands of years was dead; not the real God, but the
God that the human mind had created – the God that was in the temples
and the mosques and the churches and the synagogues, the God of the Old
Testament, the God of the Vedas. Man has outgrown those concepts.</p><p><br></p><p>Nietzsche simply declared a fact. Of course, he was as shocked by it
as everybody else was. He himself was not ready to accept it. In fact,
for his whole life he struggled to accept it. He tried to convince
himself by arguing that God is REALLY dead, but it was difficult for the
poor man. It would have been difficult for anybody. And he was a man of
steel; he was no ordinary man, he was really a strong man, but still it
was too much. He had to suffer tremendously because he was the first to
declare it, and to be a pioneer is always dangerous. He went through a
nervous breakdown. The last part of his life was a state of madness. He
risked much for this declaration.</p><p>In his great book, THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA, this parable appears.…</p><p><br></p><p>‘God is dead’ is now almost a cliche. But when Nietzsche used that
phrase it was like an earthquake, a thunderbolt from the skies – it
shattered man’s illusions. But it is only half of his message, remember;
the other half has been almost forgotten. He declared ‘God is dead’
because he wanted to declare the coming of a new man. He called that new
man ‘overman’ or ‘superman’. He said: If</p><p><br></p><p>God continues to live the old way, man cannot assert himself in total
freedom. Man cannot grow, man cannot mature. He will always remain
dependent on the father-figure. God as the great father is dead: this is
half of the message.</p><p><br></p><p>The other half is: now be on your own, stand on your own. Now become
mature. Enough of this dependence! Enough of this stupid praying! Enough
of your rituals! Stop these games!</p><p>Man has been playing many, many games in the name of God, and priests
have been exploiting man in the name of God. Nietzsche put an end to all
that; the world has never been the same again. Although Nietzsche
suffered much for his declaration, he has served humanity in a
tremendous way: he heralded a new age.</p><p>The OLD God is dead – that is a very basic requirement for the new
God to appear, a new vision of God, more in harmony with the modern,
contemporary consciousness. The God of the Old Testament was perfectly
right for the people who invented it. It was perfectly right for the
people Moses was talking to; it was a language that they understood. Now
thousands of years have passed; God needs new garments, and you go on
and on putting the old, rotten garments on Him.</p><p><br></p><p>God is not dead. God cannot be dead! But the old concept is dead.</p><p><br></p><p>Zarathustra is entrusted by Nietzsche with the task of conveying the
news of God’s death to the world.</p><p><br></p><p>As he starts on his journey he meets an old hermit, a saint. The
saint tells Zarathustra that he himself loves God but not man, because
man is too imperfect. Zarathustra replies that he loves man, and then he
asks the saint what he is doing in the forest. The saint replies, “I
make songs and sing them; and when I make songs I laugh, cry, and hum:
thus I praise God.”</p><p>The two separate, laughing like young boys. But when Zarathustra is
alone again he wonders to himself, “Could it be possible? This old saint
in the forest has not yet heard anything of this, that God is dead!”</p><p>The old saint says he loves God, not man because man is imperfect,
and Zarathustra says he loves man, and God is dead.…</p><p><br></p><p>This is going to be the new religion. It has not yet become a
reality, although a hundred years have passed since Nietzsche’s
declaration, although the declaration has spread all over the world like
wildfire. But the destructive part has happened; the creative part has
not happened yet: Nietzsche declares the superman.</p><p>Man has to be loved, because it is only through the nourishment of
love that man can grow. Man has to know that he is alone, and he has to
know that he has to depend on his own resources and not on some heavenly
father. Once man takes responsibility, total responsibility on his own
shoulders, a great revolution is bound to happen, because man has
infinite potential to grow. Remaining dependent on some God, he has
completely become oblivious to his potential, to his future, to his
growth.</p><p><br></p><p>It is good that God has been discarded. Now man has to take his life
in his own hands. And the beauty is, if you become responsible,
responsible for yourself, if you declare your freedom – you have to
declare it because God is dead; there is nobody higher than you – if you
accept that now you have to seek and search your way, you have to grope
for it on your own, life will take a new plunge into the depths of the
unknown. Life will become again an adventure. Life will again be an
ecstatic discovery of new facts, new truths, of new territories, of new
peaks of joy.</p><p><br></p><p>And it is only by becoming an adventurer that you will come upon the
new face of God – which will be far more true than the old, because it
will be far more mature than the old.</p><p>Nietzsche remained in difficulty: on the one hand he continued to
fight with the old God; on the other hand, in moments when he was not so
strong, he became scared too.</p><p><br></p><p>Zarathustra says, Away!</p><p><br></p><p>He himself fled</p><p><br></p><p>My last, only companion, My great enemy,</p><p><br></p><p>My unknown,</p><p>My hangman-god. No! Do come back With all thy tortures!</p><p><br></p><p>To the last of all that are lonely Oh, come back!</p><p>All my tear-streams run Their course to thee;</p><p><br></p><p>And my heart’s final flame –</p><p><br></p><p>Flares up for thee! Oh, come back,</p><p><br></p><p>My unknown god! My PAIN! My last – happiness!</p><p><br></p><p>These words look almost insane: “My unknown god! My pain! My last
happiness! Ah, come back!”</p><p><br></p><p>Nietzsche remained divided, split, schizophrenic. One part of him was
still afraid: “Maybe God IS alive”; maybe he was wrong. Who knows? How
could one be certain about such profound matters? And he was the first
to say it, so naturally he was scared. He wanted to get rid of the
enemy. He called God ‘the enemy’, enemy of man, because God had been
like a rock on the chest of man – your so-called God. I am not talking
about the God of Buddha and Mahavir and Zarathustra and Jesus and Moses,
no. I am talking about the God of the common masses, of the mob.
Nietzsche is also talking about the mob.</p><p>The God of the crowds is an ugly concept: it shows much about your
weaknesses, but shows nothing about the truth of existence. When you
pray on your knees you simply show your weakness, not that you know what
prayer is. When you go to the temple you go to demand something, to beg
for something. You simply show your beggarliness but nothing about God.
Very few people have known the truth of God.</p><p><br></p><p>If Nietzsche had met Buddha, Buddha would have perfectly agreed, and
yet disagreed. He would have said, “You are right: God is dead, the God
of the crowds. But there is another vision, the vision of the
enlightened ones. Their God is not a person, their God is life in its
essence. And how can life be dead? Trees are still green, birds are
still singing, the sun is still there, the night still becomes poetry,
love still happens. How can God be dead?”</p><p>God AS EXISTENCE can never be dead; God as a concept has to die many
times. Each time man grows, the old concept has to be dropped. The old
has been dropped.</p><p><br></p><p>The problem with the contemporary mind is: the old has been dropped,
half the purpose of Nietzsche’s declaration is fulfilled. The other half
is missing: man has not yet become rooted in his own being, hence there
is great meaninglessness all over the world. Everybody is feeling a kind
of dullness, sadness, frustration. Everybody is living nothing but a
kind of long, drawn-out misery, anxiety, anguish. Life has become
synonymous with a kind of agony. All that you can do is use pain
killers, tranquilizers, somehow go on pulling yourself together till
death comes and you can rest forever.</p><p>Sigmund Freud says that man can never be happy. At the most we can
reduce his unhappiness a little bit. At the most we can make him
normally unhappy. That is the goal of psychoanalysis: to make people
normally unhappy, to help them not to become abnormally unhappy. What
kind of goal is this? But this has happened, and Freud was simply
stating a fact. Looking at the modern man, looking into the unconscious
of the modern man – and he was the one man who had looked deepest into
the conscious and the unconscious mind – how could he lie? He had to say
the truth.</p><p><br></p><p>He came to understand that it is impossible for happiness to happen.
How can man ever be happy? – when God is dead, and when man has not
searched for another vision, for another goal, for another star so that
the journey can start again, the journey of meaning and significance.
Without God, man can at the most be normally unhappy.</p><p><br></p><p>Freud’s conclusion is part of Nietzsche’s declaration.</p><p><br></p><p>My work here consists in doing the other half, hence I don’t talk
much about God. Hence even if atheists come and want to become
sannyasins, I accept them with an open heart. Even they are a little
suspicious of why I am accepting them. They say, “We are atheists. We
don’t believe in God. Are you still ready to accept us as sannyasins?
Can we still meditate?”</p><p><br></p><p>And I say to them: YOU are the persons who can meditate! The person
who believes in the old God cannot meditate: he depends too much on God,
he is never a grown-up person. Meditation needs a certain growth. You
can meditate; God is not needed. God is not a prerequisite for
meditation, but when you meditate, slowly slowly you become aware of
God.</p><p><br></p><p>God is the ultimate revelation, not the prerequisite. God is not a
condition to become a sannyasin, God is the ultimate realization of
sannyas.</p><p><br></p><p>But then you will not be angry with Nietzsche, remember, because you
will know that what he was saying is also true. He was talking about the
concept of God.</p><p>Moses’s concept of God is certainly dead. When Moses died, his
concept of God died. In fact, it lived too long; for three thousand
years it continued to prevail. That simply shows the stupidity of
humanity. Otherwise the moment an enlightened person leaves the world,
his concept of God will also disappear. If we have learned anything from
the enlightened person, we will go ahead, further ahead. We will stand
on the shoulders of the enlightened person and we will be able to look
further ahead than him. We will create better visions of God, beautiful
visions of God. We will come closer and closer to the truth.</p><p><br></p><p>And remember, one can ONLY come closer and closer to the truth. The
moment you come absolutely to the truth, you disappear. Then only truth
is.</p><p>Nietzsche says, “God is dead.” I say: I am dead and God is alive,
VERY alive.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what happens if you go on meditating: one day suddenly you
find you are not, only God is.</p><p><br></p><p>The fifth question:</p><p><br></p><p>OSHO, HOW CAN I GET BACK THE WILL TO LIVE?</p><p><br></p><p>Wolfgang,</p><p><br></p><p>YOU are suffering from the ancient German disease, will to live, will
to power, will and will and will.</p><p>You have fallen in wrong company here. Either escape or we are going
to de-Germanize you, because here the message is surrender, not
will.</p><p><br></p><p>Listening to me, you must have been misunderstanding. I am not
teaching will to live. Will to live is already there, otherwise how
would you be living? Wolfgang, you are alive! That’s enough proof that
the will to live is there. If the will to live leaves you, you will not
breathe even a single breath more.</p><p><br></p><p>Who will breathe? For what? If the will to live leaves, your breath
will leave you immediately. You are still breathing; the will to live is
there. The will to live is not something to be learned, it is
inborn.</p><p><br></p><p>What has to be learned is will to surrender. That is not inborn, that
has to be learned. Will to live is a natural phenomenon, instinctive.
Will to die is not instinctive; one has to learn it with great effort.
It needs tremendous courage to learn it, even to think of it.</p><p>Sannyas is will to die, so that God can live, so that you disappear,
so that you are no more a hindrance, so that you are no more a rock in
His way.</p><p>But you must be misunderstanding me. I am saying one thing, you are
hearing something else. The German screen must be misinterpreting.</p><p><br></p><p>A fat man was seated on his front steps drinking a can of beer, when
a busybody spinster from down the street began to berate him for his
appearance.</p><p>“What a disgusting sight!” she said. “If that belly was on a woman,
I’d swear she was pregnant!” To which the man simply smiled and replied,
“Madam it was and she is.”</p><p><br></p><p>It is always possible to understand things in your own way. Words are
very flexible. Words don’t</p><p>have any fixed meaning; they cannot have. The meaning is always
provided by you.</p><p><br></p><p>When I say something, the moment it reaches you it changes its color.
You immediately dye it in your own color.</p><p>But one thing I must make you aware of is that if you want to learn
will to live, you are in a wrong place. Here, I am teaching how to die –
although one who is ready to die attains to life eternal, but that is
another matter. That is something which happens as a consequence and
cannot be used as a motive. You ARE in a wrong place.</p><p><br></p><p>The bank robbers arrived just before closing time and promptly
ordered the few remaining depositors, tellers, clerks, and guards to
disrobe and lie face down behind the counter. One nervous blonde pulled
off her clothes and lay down on the floor, facing upward.</p><p><br></p><p>“Turn over, Maybelle,” whispered the girl lying beside her. “This is
a stick-up, not an office party!”</p><p><br></p><p>You have to be aware of where you are. You are not listening to
Friedrich Nietzsche – will to power. And you are not listening to Adolf
Hitler either! You are in a totally different dimension.</p><p><br></p><p>I teach you how to die, because that is the only way that one attains
to eternal life. When the seed dies in the soil, the sprout arrives. And
when the drop disappears in the ocean, it becomes the ocean.</p><p><br></p><p>I teach you crucifixion, because resurrection follows; it inevitably
follows. I cannot promise anything, because if you crucify yourself with
the motive that you will be resurrected, then it will not happen.</p><p><br></p><p>One has to be unmotivated in the world of religion. One has to move
for the sheer joy of it and for nothing else. One has not to be
result-oriented, and that is the most difficult thing for the modern
mind to do: not to be result-oriented. Whatsoever we do, we always do it
for something else. Everything is a means and has to be used for some
end. And what I am teaching here is the end in itself; it is not a means
to anything else.</p><p><br></p><p>Each moment is an end unto itself. Enjoy it, die into it, disappear
into it, and then something miraculous happens: great eternal life
descends in you. You will be surprised, because that was not your
motivation.</p><p>I don’t talk about what is going to happen, because that can create a
disturbance in your mind; you can become too much interested in it. I
only talk about what you have to do and I leave the outcome to the
future. It will happen, because I know it is bound to happen. I don’t
tell the seeds, “Die so that you can become trees,” because if the seeds
are too interested in becoming trees they will not be able to die at
all. If the dewdrop is too interested in becoming the ocean, he will
become very hesitant, afraid to risk dropping into the ocean... who
knows?</p><p><br></p><p>I persuade the dewdrop to disappear, because disappearance is a
benediction. Disappear, drop yourself into the ocean, because dropping
and dying into the ocean is the greatest orgasmic joy IN ITSELF. And if
I can persuade the dewdrop to do this, it is going to become the ocean.
That will be a surprise, a gift from the unknown.</p><p><br></p><p>The sixth question:</p><p><br></p><p>OSHO, I HAVE ASKED THIS QUESTION OF MYSELF – IN MYRIAD WAYS FOR
SEVERAL WEEKS NOW, HAVE WATCHED IT CHANGE AND SHRINK AS WITNESSING
BROUGHT INSIGHTS, YET LEAVING THE ESSENCE UNTOUCHED.</p><p><br></p><p>LAST YEAR I LEFT, OVERFLOWING WITH THE EXPERIENCE OF YOUR COMPASSION,
LOVE, UNDERSTANDING AND A DEEP SENSE OF PERSONAL CONNECTION AND LOVE FOR
YOU. YOUR PARTING WORDS, “HURRY BACK”, SPOKE TO ME FROM YOUR BOOKS AND
TAPES AND THE FOCUS OF RETURNING NEVER WAVERED, ONLY DEEPENED, LEAVING
ALL ELSE POINTLESS.</p><p>NOW I AM HERE AND I FEEL LOST AND DISORIENTED AND ALIEN. I LISTEN TO
THE MAGIC OF YOU IN DISCOURSE WHERE I USED TO PULSATE WITH YOU, AND MY
EYES ARE DRY: THEY ARE QUITE WET AS I WRITE THIS.</p><p><br></p><p>WHERE IS THE LOVE AND THE CONNECTION I FELT FOR YOU AS MY MASTER,
SUCH AN INCREDIBLE BEING, THAT HAS SO PENETRATED ME AND MY LIFE FOR THE
LAST YEAR AND A HALF?</p><p><br></p><p>WHAT IS HAPPENING?</p><p>Prem Sharda,</p><p><br></p><p>IT IS natural, it is expected. The last time you were here, you were
here without any expectations. You were simply here, with no motivation.
You enjoyed being in my presence. You were open, available, because you
were functioning from a state of not-knowing.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, coming back, it is not the same thing. I am the same, the whole
situation is the same, but you are not the same: now you are functioning
out of a state of knowing. You are expecting things now which you were
not expecting the first time.</p><p><br></p><p>This happens to almost everybody: the first time you come you are
very innocent. My love simply reaches to you, there is no barrier. My
compassion overwhelms you. You cannot believe it, it is unbelievable, it
is too much. Then you go back with all those memories rambling in your
mind: now those memories start becoming desires. Now those memories say
to you, “Go back! Much more is going to happen. If the first time it
happened so deeply, this time it will happen even more deeply. The first
time you were just an amateur, now you are an adept. So much more is
going to happen.”</p><p><br></p><p>For all these months that you have been away, you have been dreaming,
desiring, fantasizing. Now you are here with all these fantasies,
desires, expectations – and your eyes are dry, and nothing is
happening.</p><p>You will have to drop your expectations. You will have to become
innocent again. You will have to start functioning from not-knowing
again, otherwise you will be unnecessarily creating a hell for yourself.
And it will be an absolutely private hell, because others, just sitting
by your side, are in heaven.</p><p><br></p><p>But don’t be worried about it, this is absolutely normal and natural.
This happens to everybody, Sharda; at least once, it happens. If you are
intelligent then it happens only once, if you are not intelligent then
it happens many times. Then each time you go and you come back again,
you do the same foolish thing.</p><p>l cannot fulfill your expectations, I cannot fulfill your fantasies,
I cannot fulfill your desires. I can fulfill you, but not your mind. Now
you have brought a big mind with you. It will be difficult and hard to
drop it, but there is no other way. You will have to drop it, and the
sooner you drop it, the better.</p><p><br></p><p>Sharda is a very intellectual woman, very clever, calculating,
logical, rational: She functions as a money-therapist in the West. She
helps people to get more money, to earn more, to create money, to
attract money towards themselves. So you can understand, she has a
certain very, very intellectual mind. She is not intuitive. It was a
miracle that the first time she was here she fell in love. Money-
therapists are not expected to fall in love! I was also surprised.</p><p>Now the money-therapist is back again, and with all the ideas about
how to have more – more of those experiences that had happened last time
– -how to attract those same spaces again. That is creating trouble for
you, Sharda. You have eaten the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge, and
paradise is lost. Please vomit it... just throw it out of your system.
When you are here, just be like an innocent child, and not only with me
– that is very easy, to be innocent with me – you have to be innocent
with the commune too. Put aside your knowledge, put aside all your
expertise about money.</p><p>The commune also functions through money – it has to function, there
is no other way – but the commune moves in a very illogical way. That
too creates problems for Sharda. To her expert eye,</p><p><br></p><p>she cannot believe how things are happening: they can happen better,
they can be done more methodologically.</p><p><br></p><p>But with me everything always remains a chaos. I love it! I never
allow anything to settle, because once things settle people start dying,
people start becoming zombies; so nothing is ever settled. I go on
separating couples, I go on changing their rooms, their jobs – every
possible way to unsettle you! I never allow a single moment of respite,
rest, so that you can say, “Now I have arrived.” The moment you say “I
have arrived” something is created for you so that you have to gather
your luggage again and move.</p><p>Sharda’s mind is bound to be in great difficulty; I can understand. I
don’t know anything about money, although money comes. I am not a
money-therapist, but whenever money is needed, money comes: somebody
simply comes with the money! And this has been so my whole life. I don’t
have a single rupee – you can see, I don’t even have pockets! I have
lived for many, many years without money. And I have not lived like a
beggar; that is not my way! I live like an emperor, and without money.
What Buddha could never manage, I am managing. He was an emperor; then
he could not manage to live it, the freedom of a beggar. To live the
freedom of a beggar he had to leave his kingdom. Then he lived free, but
he had to live like a beggar, begging.</p><p><br></p><p>I am living in absolute freedom, and yet I am not living like a
beggar. And I don’t go outside my room, but things happen. I cannot tell
you the secrets; in fact, there are none. I don’t know myself – how it
goes on. But once you disappear, God takes over. Then it is His
responsibility and His worry. I never worry about anything, and I don’t
think of anything as my responsibility. If this commune grows, good; if
it disappears, very good! It doesn’t matter either way.</p><p>But I can understand Sharda’s mind: she must be feeling in
difficulty. She wants to help the commune</p><p>– good</p><p><br></p><p>wishes, good intentions! – but then there will be conflict, because
this commune is run with no scientific approach towards ANYTHING. It is
a totally different approach – paradoxical, illogical, intuitive.</p><p><br></p><p>I am trying to get this whole commune to function through the right
hemisphere of the brain. And Sharda, you are entrapped in the left
hemisphere; that is creating the whole trouble. But now you have come
for one year – that too is calculation. I wanted you to come forever. I
wanted you to simply bum all the bridges there, but your money-therapist
mind... yoU would like to manage both worlds. Who knows? – if you don’t
like it here you would like to keep the home back there so that you can
always go back. You are moving in a rational way.</p><p><br></p><p>I wanted you to come back forever. That would have been a great
chance for shifting from the left hemisphere to the right hemisphere...
because every risk throws you towards the intuitive, towards the
supra-logical. Every risk is helpful in transforming your being. But you
managed, you have come for one year; that is a compromise. One year is a
long time, so you have felt contented that at least you are coming for
one year. But one year is one year; it will be gone soon. And you know
that you have a home there and you can always go back.</p><p>You have not yet entered into my boat. You are still keeping your
separate boat. Nothing is wrong</p><p><br></p><p>in keeping it separate, but then be conscious, be alert that you are
doing it. Then you are only half- heartedly with me.</p><p><br></p><p>And you are no longer young. What is left there in the West? Even
young people are here who don’t want to go back. For them there is
everything in the West; what is there in the East for them? They are
young, and the West can supply everything that they would like to enjoy.
You have enjoyed your life, you have seen everything there. America is
finished for you!</p><p><br></p><p>Have a look again, a very dispassionate look at your mind, and you
will find what I am saying. You are still being calculating with me, and
then distance remains. You have to be absolutely non- calculating. You
have to be like Mukta.</p><p>She comes from a very rich family. She is Greek, basically logical,
but the day I told her, “Finish things there and come,” she said,
“Okay.” And she FINISHED EVERYTHING and has never looked back. Even when
her father was dying, and he was asking again and again for her to come
at least to see him, she was not willing. I had to push her to go. I had
to simply order her to go, but she was not willing to go. She had
completely forgotten, as if that other world had never existed. This is
the way to be with me! This is the way to become part of my heart. This
is the way to melt in me. And with no expectation – she has not asked
for a single experience. She has not asked for a single thing in all
these years she has been here, and she had given everything to the
commune!</p><p><br></p><p>Only such surrender, such trust, such unmotivated love, can bring the
transformation that you long for.</p><p><br></p><p>Sharda, your longing is right, but you will have to change your mind.
Your mind is wrong; it is expert in things which are hindrances
here.</p><p>The last question:</p><p><br></p><p>OSHO, I KNOW FOR SURE THAT MY WIFE IS UTTERLY FAITHFUL TO ME, BUT
STILL DOUBT GOES ON LINGERING SOMEWHERE INSIDE ME. WHAT SHOULD I DO TO
GET RID OF THE DOUBT?</p><p><br></p><p>Avinash,</p><p><br></p><p>IN THE first place, why should you ask that she should be faithful to
you? It is from there that doubt arises. The very desire that your wife
should be faithful TO YOU is the beginning of doubt. Why? Who are you
that she should be faithful to you? She should be faithful to herself,
you should be faithful to yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what love is. If you love the woman, you would like her to be
faithful to herself, because you would like her to be authentic. You
would like her to be an individual in her own right. Why should you
demand that she should be faithful to you? Who are you? – just a
stranger. YOU need not be faithful to her, you have to be faithful to
yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>This is my basic approach; it has to be understood well. Down the
ages it has been said: be faithful to your husband, be faithful to your
wife, be faithful to this and that. Nobody has told you: be faithful
just to yourself. And that’s exactly what my message is: be faithful to
yourself. Then doubt disappears.</p><p><br></p><p>Doubt is not good, but doubt is a by-product of a desire, a wrong
desire – that she should be faithful to you. And how can you except
anybody to be faithful to you? In that very expectation, you are asking
something so unnatural that doubt will arise. Who knows? – she may come
across a beautiful man, far more beautiful than you are. And you know
there are men who are far more beautiful. Fear, doubt, are bound to be
there. Who knows? she may be getting fed-up with you!</p><p>In fact there is every possibility that you yourself are fed-up with
yourself. You know how ugly you are, how ugly your habits are; she must
have come to know by now.</p><p><br></p><p>In the beginning things are different. When you meet a woman on the
beach, just for a few hours things are different. The full moon creates
great illusions, and the ocean, and the vibrant air, and the silence,
and the night, and the unknown territory... the woman. She is unknown to
you, you are unknown to her; both would like to explore each other’s
geographies. You are tremendously interested, she is, but once you have
travelled the geography so many times, the same contours.… You know you
are fed-up with your wife, so deep down the doubt arises that she may be
fed-up with you.</p><p>Don’t ask for faithfulness, ask for freedom. Give freedom so that you
can have freedom. And if out of freedom you go on loving each other, it
is beautiful. Out of freedom everything has beauty. But out of a certain
duty, if she even remains faithful to you, it has no value. When she
comes across a beautiful man on the road and a longing arises in her
heart to know this man, to be with this man, but she knows this is not
right – she represses it. She has already gone away, she is no more with
you. You may be holding her hand in your hand, but she is no more with
you. Her whole being has gone in that moment. She may not ever do
anything, but in her fantasy, in her imagination... You cannot control
her fantasy, you cannot control her imagination. In her dreams she may
be making love to other people. And who makes love to one’s own husband
in a dream? Have you ever heard of such a foolish woman or a foolish
man? Have you ever made love to your own wife? – one always makes love
to other people’s wives in dreams.</p><p><br></p><p>In dreams you are free and private. The magistrate is not there, the
policeman is not there, the wife is not there, nobody is there. You are
again free. So just on the surface you can fulfill formalities.</p><p>The doubt is arising because you have a wrong expectation in the
first place. I cannot help you to drop the doubt unless you drop the
desire that your wife should be faithful to you. Drop the desire that
your wife should be faithful to you. Drop that, and then if you can
create the doubt, it will be a miracle. Then how can doubt arise?</p><p><br></p><p>We never go to the very root of problems, we only go on changing the
symptoms. My help is available to you only to go to the deep root of the
problem, to the very foundation of it. Change it there!</p><p><br></p><p>And you say, “I KNOW FOR SURE THAT MY WIFE IS UTTERLY FAITHFUL TO
ME.”</p><p><br></p><p>How can you be so sure? You are just trying to convince yourself by
using these words, that “I am sure” – just using great words to hide
something! You are not sure. See the cunningness of the mind. You are
not sure, hence you are using the word ‘sure’: “I KNOW FOR SURE THAT MY
WIFE IS UTTERLY FAITHFUL TO ME.” Just faithfulness won’t do? Utterly
faithful? Is there some doubt? Why UTTERLY faithful?</p><p><br></p><p>A circle is simply a circle. You cannot say that this is a complete
circle, UTTERLY circular. If it is a circle it is a circle! You cannot
call it a perfect circle, because if it is not perfect it is not a
circle, it must be something else.</p><p>Watch, meditate on these words.</p><p><br></p><p>“BUT STILL,” you say, “I DOUBT. SOMEWHERE DOUBT GOES ON
LINGERING.”</p><p><br></p><p>You doubt your wife? Are you certain about your faithfulness towards
her? Maybe that’s why the doubt arises. You may be fooling around, if
not actually, then in imagination. And then naturally the inference is
there that your wife may be fooling around, if not actually, at least in
imagination. And the male ego is such that it cannot allow even the wife
to fool around in imagination.</p><p><br></p><p>The story is told of Mulla Nasruddin, who got married and spent a
pleasant honeymoon with his bride. But one day he came to the office
with a rather glum expression on his face. When his fellow clerks asked
him what was bothering him he said, “Gee, I pulled a terrible boner this
morning. Getting out of bed I, like an absent-minded jackass, laid down
a ten rupee note on the table.”</p><p><br></p><p>The other man consoled him. His wife wouldn’t think anything of it,
they assured him. “That isn’t what bothers me.” he answered. “She gave
me three rupees change!”</p><p>It may be your own mind. When a beautiful woman passes by, does
something happen to you or not? Only in two cases will nothing happen:
either you are dead or enlightened – which mean the same! Otherwise
something is bound to happen. And then the suspicion: the same must be
happening to your woman too, because she is as unenlightened as you are
and as alive as you are.</p><p>Maybe the doubt is there because you are not loving her as much as
she would like you to love her. And it happens to couples – how can you
go on having the same peak of love that was there in the beginning, the
honeymoon peak? One has to come down. Sooner or later one has to come
down from the hills to the ordinary, mundane life. Sooner or later one
has to forget ali poetry, fantasy, romance. And then a fear arises:
maybe</p><p>gave himot loving her as much as I should, I am not taking as much
care as I should? Maybe this will become an opportunity for her to move
with somebody else?</p><p><br></p><p>Look into yourself.…</p><p><br></p><p>A husband comes home and finds his wife in bed with a man. He is
furious and wants to leave at once. The wife pleads, “Give me a moment
to explain. This man came to my door an hour ago and asked for something
to eat. I gave him a sandwich. I noticed that his shoes were worn out,
so I</p><p><br></p><p>looked in your closet and found a pair that you haven’t had on your
feet for five years, and I gave him the shoes to put on. Then I saw that
his jacket was very tom, so I went back to your closet and found a
jacket that you haven’t worn for eight years. When he took his old
jacket off to put yours on, I saw that his shirt was falling to pieces,
so I opened your bureau drawer and gave him a shirt that you haven’t
worn for the past twelve years. Then as this man was going out of the
door he turned to me and asked,</p><p><br></p><p>“Is there anything else around here that your husband doesn’t
use?”</p><p><br></p><p>Avinash, it is not a question of your wife, it is a question of your
own mind. Just look deep down... have you been with her? For how long
have you not been with her? – I don’t mean physically, I mean
spiritually. For how long have you not seen her face? – just remember;
for how long have you not looked into her eyes? Figure it out, and you
will be surprised that for years you have taken her for granted, and
that may be the cause of your doubt.</p><p>Remember, problems are always part of your mind. Go deep into them.
In the first place, don’t ask that she should be faithful to you; that
is violent. Nobody has the right to ask anybody to be faithful towards
him. Help her to be faithful towards herself.</p><p><br></p><p>And secondly, look inside your own being. Are you still in love with
her? If you are, then the doubt is not possible. The doubt simply
reflects that your love has disappeared. Life has become a drag; you
have started taking her for granted. Love is no more there. Now it is
only a hangover, hence the doubt. Bring the love back, bring the poetry
back, bring the romance back.</p><p><br></p><p>And those who are intelligent, they can bring it back every day.
Every morning they can look at the wife, at the husband, with fresh
eyes.</p><p>Go on dying to the past experiences, so that you can remain available
to the present, fresh, young, utterly intelligent, and then life has a
totally different flavor. Then these stupid things don’t arise in the
mind at all.</p><p><br></p><p>CHAPTER <span class=s9>15</span></p><p><br></p><p>From zero learning to learning zero</p><p><br></p><p>1 0 M a y 1 9 7 9 a m i n B u d d h a H a l l</p><p><br></p><p>The first question:</p><p><br></p><p>OSHO, YOU HAVE NEVER CHOSEN TO ANSWER EVEN ONE OF MY MANY QUESTIONS
FOR DISCOURSE, AND YET YOU HAVE ANSWERED THEM ALL, SOMETIMES BY YOUR
WORDS… SOMETIMES IN THE TONE, TEXTURE, AND RHYTHM OF YOUR SONG… AND
SOMETIMES JUST IN THE WAY THE MOMENTS UNFOLD WHILE BEING NEAR YOU. THERE
ARE NO WORDS FOR MY GRATITUDE, JUST THE THROBBING OF MY HEART, LIKE A
NEWBORN BIRD.</p><p>Prem Atta,</p><p>I had not chosen your questions deliberately. I know you can
understand my silence; words would only be a disturbance. You can
understand my heart. There is no need for any language to exist between
me and you.</p><p><br></p><p>I was thinking continuously that you must be worried about why I am
not answering your questions. And all your questions were significant,
worth answering, but still I had not answered them. I was waiting for
your response; that has come today. You understood my silence; you
understood my not answering you. I am tremendously happy.</p><p><br></p><p>Each of my sannyasins slowly, slowly has to learn just to understand
the language of my presence, just to understand love, just to understand
being with me - that's enough. Anything said makes a distance, creates a
distance. Nothing said, and all distance disappears.</p><p><br></p><p>Two hearts can become one if they are able to drop language, because
dropping language means dropping the mind itself. Mind is language and
nothing else. The moment there is no language, there is no thought. When
there is no thought there is no mind. And that utter silence that
pervades in those moments, that primal silence that descends and
permeates you in those moments, is what God is all about. To feel that
primal silence is to know God.</p><p>God is not a person, God is not a principle, God is not a theory. God
is the experience of primal silence, wordless, mindless
consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>I have given you the name Prem Atta. Prem means love, Atta means self
- one whose very self is love; not love as a relationship, but love as a
state of being. Love cannot be expressed. It can be understood but it
cannot be said; it can be shown but it cannot be said. And I have been
showing you the answer, and I am happy, tremendously happy, that you
have heard it. You are blessed.</p><p><br></p><p>Get more and more in tune with my presence, not with my person,
because I am not a person at all. I only appear as a person; otherwise I
am just an absence. As far as the person is concerned I am utterly
absent, but in that absence there is a light, there is a presence. That
presence has nothing to do with me. That presence has no center to it,
that presence has no self in it. That presence is as much yours as mine.
That presence is divine. If you are silent your heart will start
pulsating with it, your heart will start singing with it, your heart
will have a dance with it. Your heart will start moving, soaring
upwards.</p><p>Every man, every woman, is born with a bird in the heart. The heart
has wings, but the heart can open its wings only in the sky of silence.
Words are weighty, words gravitate towards the earth. Forget all about
words and let the celebration be.</p><p><br></p><p>The second question:</p><p><br></p><p>OSHO, WHAT IS LEARNING?</p><p>Vedant,</p><p>Learning, in the first place, is not knowledge. Let us start from
negating, from eliminating; let us first say what learning is not.</p><p>Learning is not knowledge. Learning has become too much identified
with knowledge. It is just the opposite of knowledge. The more
knowledgeable a person is, the less he is capable of learning. Hence
children are more capable of learning than grown-ups. And if the
grown-ups also want to remain learners, they have to go on forgetting
whatsoever they have learned. Whatsoever has become knowledge in them,
they have to go on dying to it. If you collect your knowledge your inner
space becomes too heavy with the past. You accumulate too much
garbage.</p><p><br></p><p>Learning happens only when there is spaciousness. The child has that
spaciousness, innocence. The beauty of the child is that he functions
from the state of not-knowing, and that is the fundamental secret of
learning: functioning from the state of not-knowing.</p><p><br></p><p>Watch, see, observe, but never form a conclusion. If you have already
arrived at a conclusion, learning stops. If you already know, what is
there to learn? Never function from the ready-made answer that you have
arrived at from the scriptures, universities, teachers, parents, or
maybe your own experience.</p><p>All that you have known has to be discarded in favor of learning.
Then you will go on growing, and then there is no end to growth. Then a
person goes on remaining childlike, innocent, full of wonder and awe to
the very end. Even when he is dying he continues learning. He learns
life, he learns death. And the person who has learned life and learned
death goes beyond both; he moves to the transcendental.</p><p>Learning is receptivity, learning is vulnerability. Learning is
openness, open-endedness.</p><p>Learning can be divided into many categories. I would like to divide
it into eight levels, eight planes. The first level of learning is
called by Gregory Bateson `zero learning'. I love that denomination
-</p><p>zero learning. It is only called learning, it is not really learning.
Zero learning means learning something mechanically, computer-like,
parrot-like. You don't really learn anything at all; you only repeat,
just like the parrot repeats. You can teach the parrot a prayer and he
will repeat it, not knowing at all what he is doing. There is no meaning
in it. You may think that there is meaning because those words carry
meaning to you.</p><p>If you are a Hindu and you have taught the parrot `Hare Krishna, Hare
Rama', he will repeat it, and listening to the parrot you will think
there is meaning. That meaning is within you, not in the parrot. The
parrot is simply repeating, not knowing what it is. It is purely a
mechanical gesture.</p><p><br></p><p>It is very unfortunate that much of our so-called learning comes into
this first category, zero learning. Our whole educational system is
rooted in zero learning: we teach children just to repeat. The better
they are in repeating certain things, the more intelligent they are
thought to be. We don't teach them to discover, we don't teach them to
be original, we don't teach them to invent. We simply teach them to
repeat, and if they can repeat well they go on passing examinations.</p><p>This creates a very mechanical humanity. Robot-like, people live.
They are just machines, because almost ninety percent of what they know
belongs to this category: zero learning. They have learned much and yet
they have not learned a thing.</p><p><br></p><p>Beware of this first level of learning, avoid it. And if you are
parents, help your children not to be repetitive but to be original.
Sometimes it is better to be wrong and original than to be right and
repetitive, because the original will bring intelligence to you. The
repetitive, howsoever right, is not going to make you intelligent. And
what kind of learning is learning if it doesn't create intelligence?</p><p><br></p><p>Look at the world, look at the whole situation of humanity: it is so
unintelligent that it appears there is no learning happening at all.
From the K.G. to the university, the whole thing seems to be repetitive.
The whole thing seems to be rooted in memory, not in consciousness. It
does not help you to become more conscious, more alert. It does not help
you to find new answers.</p><p><br></p><p>And life goes on changing, life is never the same. You have to
respond freshly again and again, and your knowledge does not allow you
to act freshly. You go on repeating old clichés, old routines. You go on
repeating old answers, and life is asking new questions. Life never asks
the same question again. Life is so original: each moment it is new, the
situation is new, the challenge is new - and you are old. That's the
misery. You are always lagging behind; you are always missing the train!
You reach the station only when the train has left, hence a great
feeling of missing. You can look into anybody's eyes and you can see it:
everybody feels he is missing something.</p><p>What are you missing? You are missing life itself, because there is a
gap between you and life. Life requires you to be original, and your
educational system, your society, your culture, requires you to be
repetitive. Your culture is more interested in efficiency than in
intelligence, so you are efficient. You have ready-made answers for
everything. Your mind is nothing but a filing system; your mind
functions like a computer. You have not yet learned how to function like
a man.</p><p><br></p><p>The second level of learning is learning one: it is purposive. The
first learning has no purpose in it, because you function mechanically
and machines cannot have purposes. The second learning has purpose:
learning one. It has a sense of direction, although the sense of
direction is unconscious. You are not clear about it, you are not
conscious about it. You function like a plant, like a tree. The tree has
a certain sense of direction, it knows where the sun is, it moves, but
the movement is instinctive.</p><p>In African jungles trees go very high. They have to go, because if
they remain low they will die. They will never be able to absorb
sunrays; they will miss Vitamin D. They have to struggle to go higher
and higher and higher. You bring the same trees to India and they don't
go that high. Give</p><p>them good soil, good manure, water, everything, but they don't go.
There is no need - the sun is available so easily, why should they
bother?</p><p>The second layer is like trees, the first is like machines; the
second is far better. From the second you start becoming alive. Our
bodies function in the second way, instinctively. The body has an
instinctive wisdom, but there is no need to remain confined to it; it is
a very low stage of learning. Just to be a tree is not of much
significance, it is not life; rather it is vegetating. The second level
of learning I call</p><p>`learning one', because learning starts from the second level.</p><p><br></p><p>And the third level of learning I call `learning two'. With it you
become a little bit conscious. You start functioning like animals, not
like trees. You can move, the trees are rooted. They have a little
freedom of going up, changing their direction, growing in certain
directions, not growing in certain directions, but they are rooted. They
don't have a will, they can't move.</p><p>The third level of learning - that is learning two - is a little bit
conscious. Some intelligence has arisen. Animals start behaving in a
more intelligent way: it is vaguely conscious of purpose. It is a
twilight phenomenon. It is between consciousness and unconsciousness;
you can call it subconscious. It is the beginning of real intelligence,
just the beginning. Many people have remained with zero learning, very
few move to learning one, an even lesser number move to learning
two.</p><p>The fourth level of learning I call `learning three'; conscious
direction, meaningful existence. You don't simply go on drifting like
wood. You are no more at the mercy of the winds and the waves. You have
a goal, you know where you are going, you know why you are going - a
clear-cut sense of direction. Life starts becoming more a
discipline.</p><p><br></p><p>The word `discipline' really means learning, hence the word
'disciple' - one who is capable of learning. Real learning starts with
learning three. Very rarely, very few people come to this point. Only
very few fortunate people exist with a clear-cut direction, move not
accidentally. Ordinarily people are just moving accidentally.</p><p><br></p><p>Just a few days ago I was reading the autobiography of a Jewish poet.
He begins his autobiography by saying, "My birth was an accident. My
father was traveling in a train; the train was late. He arrived at the
station, his destination, in the middle of the night. No taxis were
available, all taxis had already left. Snow was falling."</p><p><br></p><p>It was so cold and so dark and he was feeling so lonely. He looked
around for somebody to talk to, to find a way to reach the hotel, or to
see whether he could manage to stay the night at the station. The woman
who ran the cafe there was just closing it. He asked her for a cup of
coffee, the woman gave him a cup of coffee. She was also alone. And then
he said he was in a fix - no taxis available. He would like to reach to
some hotel to sleep, he was tired.</p><p><br></p><p>The woman said, "Why don't you come with me in my car? I can take you
to the hotel." And he went in the car with the woman, and this is how
their friendship started. When they reached the hotel, the hotel was
closed, so the woman said, "You come and stay with me." So he stayed
with the woman, fell in love with the woman. After a few days they got
married, and this poet was born. Now he says, "My birth was just an
accident. If the train had not been late I would not have been born at
all. If the train had been a little later, just a few minutes, and if
the woman had left, I would not have been born at all. If the hotel had
still been open, I would not be in the world at all."</p><p>This is how ordinary life goes on: just accidental, no definite goal,
no definite direction, no star there</p><p>far away calling you forth so that you can manage not to go zigzag
but straight.</p><p>The fifth level of learning I call `learning four'. It is not only
conscious of a direction, it is conscious of consciousness itself. It is
learning four that becomes meditation. That's what we are doing here: it
is learning four - making you conscious of your consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>To be conscious of a goal is one thing: you are objective. You are
not conscious of your consciousness, you are simply conscious of the
goal. That is the function of the ordinary school, college, university:
to make you conscious of a goal-oriented life.</p><p>The function of a mystery school - a mystery school just like this -
is higher than the function of a university. Its function is to make you
conscious of your consciousness. To be conscious of one's consciousness
is meditation; it is the first step to being really human.</p><p>Learning three is the beginning of being human. Learning four is
attaining humanity, is attaining manhood; it is attaining maturity. But
this is not the end.</p><p>The sixth level of learning, learning five, gives you glimpses of the
divine, satori. That is the purpose of meditation, of dhyana: to bring
you to the glimpses of the beyond ... because man is not the end. Man
himself is only a means, a passage, a bridge - don't make your house on
the bridge. The bridge is not for the house to be made on; it has to be
passed. Man has to be surpassed.</p><p>Friedrich Nietzsche is reported to have said: The greatest day in
humanity's life will be when man becomes absolutely aware of surpassing
himself. And the worst day, the greatest calamity, will be the day when
man forgets how to surpass himself.</p><p>Man is an arrow on the bow. It should not remain there on the bow; it
has to leave the bow, it has to move. Man is a pilgrimage.</p><p>First become conscious of your consciousness. And in that very
becoming, in that very silence - when you are only conscious of your
consciousness and not of any other content - no thought, no desire, no
dream - you are just conscious of your being conscious, the mirror is
reflecting itself and nothing else. In that moment, something immensely
miraculous happens. You become aware of the divine; you become aware of
the essential core of your being.</p><p>That is learning five, the sixth level of learning. It gives you
glimpses of no-self. It gives you glimpses of the beyond. It makes you
aware that man is not the end, that man is only a step. You become aware
of the temple. You become aware of the mystery of existence, of the
eternity of life, of deathlessness, of timelessness. This is the point
where one starts feeling that God is.</p><p><br></p><p>The seventh level of learning, `learning six', Patanjali calls
savikalpa samadhi. You have attained to the glimpse of the ultimate; not
only is it a glimpse, now it is settling, crystallizing, becoming
substantial, not only a shadow - but there is still a possibility of
losing it. He calls it savikalpa samadhi. Savikalpa means still there is
some lingering thought; not ordinary thoughts, but a new kind of
thought, that "I have arrived," that "I have attained," that "I am
fulfilled" - a very purified ego, a very pious ego, very subtle. Like
the fragrance of a flower, you cannot catch hold of it.</p><p>One has to be very, very careful. Otherwise the seeker stops at
learning six, and one thinks one has come home. Because one feels God's
presence, one is tremendously happy, as one has never been. One knows
there is no death, all fear disappears - but one is still there!</p><p><br></p><p>A disciple of a Zen Master was meditating for twenty years. Again and
again he would bring his experiences and the Master would throw him out
saying, "This is all rubbish! Go again and meditate! Unless you can come
with the experience of nothing, don't come to me."</p><p>And one day it happened; the experience of nothing happened. He felt
no-being, a deep nothingness, nobody inside. He was tremendously happy.
He went running to the Master, fell at his feet, and said, "It has
happened - I have seen nothingness!” The Master said, "Get out! Get out
immediately! Because if you have seen nothingness, you are still there.
This is not true nothingness - something of you still has roots. Only
come to me when there is nobody even to say that ’I have known
nothingness'."</p><p><br></p><p>And then years passed, and the disciple didn't turn up. Then one day
the Master had to go to the disciple. The disciple was sitting
underneath a tree, playing on his flute. The Master went close. The
disciple continued playing on the flute as if nobody had come. The
Master blessed him and said, "Now it has happened! Now you are utterly
unconcerned. Now you don't claim. Now it has become so natural that
there is no idea of ’I'."</p><p>At the seventh level of learning, learning six, you feel nothingness,
but you feel it. That is the last barrier: the 'I'.</p><p><br></p><p>The eighth level of learning I call `learning zero'. The first I
called `zero learning', the last I call</p><p>`learning zero'. Patanjali calls it nirvikalpa samadhi, nirbeej
samadhi, seedless samadhi. Now even the seed is burnt, nothing is left.
You are gone forever. You are no more, only God is. Not that you know
God is; you are not separate to know. There is no duality, there is no
I-thou, there is only God. This is the moment of primal silence.</p><p><br></p><p>These are the eight levels of learning. Move from zero learning to
learning zero, and the circle is complete. People are encaged in the
first, zero learning, and they have to be freed from there. And the
ultimate is learning zero. Hence Buddha called the ultimate shunya,
zero.</p><p><br></p><p>Vedant, you ask me, "What is learning?" Learning is the movement from
zero learning to learning zero.</p><p>The third question:</p><p><br></p><p>OSHO, I THINK I HAVE BECOME ENLIGHTENED. WHAT DO YOU SAY ABOUT
IT?</p><p><br></p><p>Nisarga,</p><p>The moment one becomes enlightened, one does not think that one is
enlightened; one simply knows. Thinking is guessing, it is not knowing.
And when one becomes enlightened one never asks ’whether I have become
enlightened', because it is self-evident; no certificate is needed. And
Nisarga, when you become enlightened I will come to you to bless you.
You will not need to come to me and ask.</p><p>An old Welsh lady, seventy-five years old, is in the doctor's
surgery.</p><p>"Well, I know it is hard to believe, Mrs. Jones, but the tests are
conclusive: you are pregnant!" the doctor tells her.</p><p>"But I am seventy-five years old, doctor, and my husband is
eighty-five years old. Are you certain? This will be such a shock for
him."</p><p>"Yes, I am certain. You must tell him very carefully because of his
age. I suggest you telephone him from my office now."</p><p>Mrs. Jones dials the number, then speaks: "Hello Hughie, darling, I
have some news for you. Please sit down before I tell you. Are you
sitting? Good. I am pregnant. The doctor is certain and the tests are
all positive."</p><p>There was a short pause and Hughie's quavering voice was heard to
say, "Who is that speaking,</p><p>please?"</p><p>Nisarga, that's what I would like to ask: who is that speaking,
please?</p><p>If it has happened, you are no more. If it has happened, there will
be nobody to ask the question. If it has happened, your fragrance will
tell people; you will become luminous.</p><p>Mulla Nasruddin had a male child after producing fourteen girls in a
row from his four wives. When he heard the good news he went on a
week-long celebration that broke several records. On the seventh day
somebody asked him, "Who does it look like, you or your wife?" "I don't
know yet," the proud father happily chortled. "We have not looked at his
face yet."</p><p><br></p><p>When after fourteen girls you give birth to a male child, who has
time to look at his face? After millions and millions of lives, when you
become enlightened, who bothers to ask? It is so absolute, and the sheer
joy of it is such... yes, one can dance, but one cannot ask; one can
sing, but one cannot ask. One will go almost mad: that's what Kabir
says. Again and again he says that those who know God go mad, mad in
ecstasy.</p><p><br></p><p>Nisarga, you are perfectly in your senses; you have not gone mad. I
have been watching you - there is no ecstasy. It may be just a desire, a
wish-fulfillment. You would like to become enlightened, you would like
somebody to tell you that you have become enlightened. You would like to
be certified, but these things cannot be certified. These are not things
of the outer world; when they happen there is a totally new
phenomenon.</p><p>When a Buddha is there, or a Krishna, or a Kabir, or a Jesus, or a
Mohammed, something of God penetrates into the very dense earth,
something of the sky starts walking here on the earth. Those who have
eyes can see it, those who have ears can hear it, those who have hearts
can feel it, and those who are intelligent enough will learn the secret
of it.</p><p><br></p><p>But you need not ask such questions; these questions are meaningless.
I understand your desire, but on the way of enlightenment even the
desire to become enlightened is a barrier - the greatest barrier. Forget
all about enlightenment! Dance to abandon! Whatsoever you are doing
here, do it totally. Forget all about enlightenment - it will take care
of itself, it will come of its own accord. You cannot bring it; it is
not something that you can manage to do. If you can be simply lost in
the ordinary activities of life, totally lost, utterly lost... one day,
when the ego is missing… You may be just cleaning the floor, or chopping
wood, or carrying water from the well; when the ego is completely
absent, as if there is nobody who is chopping wood - wood is chopped but
there is nobody chopping wood - suddenly it is there. It comes as a
surprise. And when it comes it brings its own absolute certainty.</p><p><br></p><p>The fourth question:</p><p><br></p><p>OSHO, IS IT NOT POSSIBLE TO RAISE CHILDREN IN SUCH A WAY THAT THEY
NEVER BECOME INTERESTED IN THE DIRTY THINGS OF LIFE?</p><p>Chandrakand,</p><p>What do you mean by "dirty things of life"? Life is all beautiful!
Even dirt is not dirty, even dirt has its own splendor. Because life is
divine - how can it be dirty? You have not asked this question out of
intelligence, awareness, meditativeness; you have asked this question
out of prejudice, tradition. This is not your question; your society has
implanted it in you. You must be a typical Indian, hence the
question.</p><p>India has great expertise in condemning. India has lived for at least
twenty-five centuries in a very life- negative way. It was not so
always. India is an ancient land: the civilization has existed for at
least ten</p><p>thousand years. It is only in these last twenty-five centuries that
it became more and more life- negative. Otherwise the Indian mystic was
the greatest life-affirmative mystic the world has known. The Indian
mystic loved life, rejoiced in life and all that life implied.</p><p>But whenever something reaches to a peak, the valley is bound to
follow. It is a constant rhythm of life; mountains cannot be without
valleys. When a great wave comes, following it, in the wake, is a hollow
wave, a negative wave. Day is followed by night, night is followed by
day. Life is followed by death, death is followed by life. Existence
consists of polar opposites.</p><p>India reached to a very great peak of life-affirmation in the
Upanishads. The Upanishads are the expression of life-affirmation. Then
the decline came; it was bound to come.</p><p>The life-negative aspect started asserting itself, and then
everything became condemned. Sex became condemned - in a country which
has made Khajuraho, Konarak, Puri. Sex became condemned in the country
which had written the first book of sexology in the world. Sex became
condemned in the country of Vatsayana, whom the country had loved and
respected as a Buddha. He is the first man in the world who wrote a
great sexual treatise, one of the most profound.</p><p><br></p><p>Sigmund Freud, Havelock Ellis, Masters and Johnson are just children
compared to Vatsayana's insight into sex. Sex became condemned in a
country which had raised it to the highest pedestal of Tantra, which had
said that the sexual experience is the closest to the experience of God.
And not only sex, when life becomes condemned everything becomes
condemned - food, clothes, relationships, everything that life implies
becomes condemned. For twenty-five centuries India has lived in a
terrible mess. But now, the turning-point is coming again. Now the days
of the valley are over. Now again life-affirmation will assert. My
sannyas is just to herald a new phase, a new dawn.</p><p><br></p><p>What do you mean, Chandrakand, by saying "dirty things of life"? And
you cannot protect children. Those protected children will not have any
spine. They will be dull, insipid, dead. They will not have sharpness of
intelligence, because you will be avoiding all challenges in their
lives, you will be protecting them too much. Your protection will become
an imprisonment.</p><p><br></p><p>No, children have to be made aware of all that life implies - good
and bad, all, day and night, all, summer and winter, all, flowers and
thorns, all. The children have to be made available to the wholeness of
life, because only then will they be whole.</p><p><br></p><p>There was once a king and his young wife. They were very much in love
and life was good. Then one day the queen died while giving birth to
their first child, a son. The king was beside himself with grief. He
determined at least to protect his son from the possibility of such a
cruel misfortune. He decreed that the young prince was never to know of
the existence of women. So the boy grew up in peace but knowing nothing
of the female.</p><p>One day, when the boy was almost fifteen he was walking in the
orchard with his father when a little urchin girl who had come to steal
apples ran across their path.</p><p>"Ah, look father!" said the boy. "What is that?"</p><p>The king hesitated a second or two. "It is a swan," he replied.</p><p>Some days later the king called his son. "Well, my son, you are
almost fifteen. What would you like as</p><p>a birthday gift?”</p><p>"Ah, father, please may I have a swan?" the boy replied.</p><p><br></p><p>It is impossible to keep somebody unaware of life's complexities.
Many times the experiment has been done and each time it has been a
failure.</p><p>When Buddha was born all the great astrologers of the country
gathered, of course. In his late old age</p><p>the king had given birth to a child. No one had ever heard of a child
so beautiful and a child with such grace that he did not seem to be part
of this world, as if a god was born. So, all the astrologers gathered to
predict about him. They calculated, they looked into their scriptures,
and they were at a loss as to what to say. All the astrologers except
one raised two fingers.</p><p><br></p><p>The king said, "What do you mean by raising two fingers? Don't speak
in riddles!"</p><p>They said, "But we are in a riddle ourselves. We are raising two
fingers because all the scriptures we have consulted say two things
about this child: either he will become a chakravartin, a world emperor,
or he will become a sannyasin. But nothing definite can be said, hence
we are raising two fingers: one to say either he will be the greatest
emperor in the world who will rule the whole world -</p><p>chakravartin means one who will rule all the six continents - or he
will be a sannyasin and he will renounce the world and move into the
mountains, into the forests, into deep meditation, and he will become a
Buddha."</p><p>The king looked at the one man, one astrologer, the youngest, who was
still silent. He asked him, "What do you say?" He raised only one
finger.</p><p>The king said, "Now what do you mean by one finger - emperor or
sannyasin?"</p><p><br></p><p>The young astrologer said, "He will become a sannyasin, that is
absolutely certain."</p><p>The king was not happy with the young astrologer. He said, "You are
young in age, inexperienced. All your old colleagues are saying
either-or."</p><p>He simply forgot his advice. He listed to the older ones and he asked
them, "What should I do so that he becomes a chakravartin and does not
renounce the world?"</p><p>They suggested some very common-sense advice. If I had been there I
would not have suggested it at all, but I know the king would not have
listened to me either, just as he had not listened to the young
astrologer. People listen to that which they want to listen to.</p><p>Those old astrologers said, "Do a few things. One: keep him in such
pleasure that he never becomes aware of pain, that he never comes to
know of suffering. If he never comes to know of suffering he will never
renounce, because people renounce the world because of suffering." That
is utter nonsense!</p><p>People don't renounce the world because of suffering, remember.
People renounce the world because they become fed-up with pleasure.</p><p>You can see it here: so many Westerners and so few Indians. Why?
India is in suffering - people cannot think of sannyas. They are
hankering for more and more possessions. They have not known that
possessions can't give anything; they have not known the futility of
riches how can they renounce? How can they start moving higher than the
worldly things? How can they think of meditation? In fact, they are
puzzled, looking at all you Westerners coming to me. They are very much
puzzled, confused: "Why are you coming here?"</p><p><br></p><p>Many of my sannyasins come to me and say, "Whenever we meet Indians
they immediately ask how their son can get admission into Harvard, into
Cambridge, into Oxford: ’How can we have some help from the Ford
Foundation or the Rockefeller Foundation? I would like my son to become
a great engineer - or a physicist or a surgeon.'"</p><p>My sannyasins say to me, "They don't see that we have come from
Harvard and Cambridge and</p><p>Oxford, seeing the whole futility of it.”</p><p><br></p><p>There are at least two hundred PH.D'S present here today, and at
least one thousand postgraduates from all the universities of the world.
But the Indian cannot see that these people are coming from there; he
asks how he can manage it. His only hope is to make his son
'foreignreturned '; that is a qualification. Even if he fails at
Cambridge that doesn't matter, he is 'Londonreturned '; that is enough
of a qualification. A poor country, a suffering country, cannot think of
anything more.</p><p>Those astrologers suggested, "Give him all kinds of pleasures. Gather
all the beautiful women of the country around him. Let him live for
twenty-four hours as if he is in paradise - music, song, dance,
beautiful women, wine. Let him be drowned in pleasure and he will never
renounce."</p><p><br></p><p>And that's what the king did - and that's why Buddha renounced. He
became so fed-up: he had all the beautiful women, all the good things of
life. His father had made three palaces for him for different seasons,
so he would never suffer the heat of summer, so he would never suffer
the cold of winter, so he would never suffer too much rain - three
palaces in different places, in different climates, in different
situations. He was continuously on the merry-go-round. The whole day was
nothing but celebration, holiday. Every day was a holiday. From the
morning till the night, he was</p><p>surrounded by beautiful women, wine, dance, music, good food. Life
was all roses. And he was only twenty-nine when he became so bored with
all this that he escaped. He simply ran away.</p><p>If the king had asked me, I would have suggested, "This is stupid! If
you do this he is bound to become a sannyasin. If you want him to become
a chakravartin then let him suffer, let him go through pain, let him go
through starvation. Let him see how life is a misery so that he longs
for pleasure, strives for pleasure."</p><p>But that was not to happen. And it is good that I was not there,
otherwise you would have missed the Buddha. It is good that the king
didn't listen to the young astrologer. His name was Kodana; he must have
been a rare man, of great insight. But all those old fools, they
convinced the king. And it is good that it happened the way it happened;
to have missed Buddha would have been a great calamity. The world has
never been the same since Buddha: some fragrance has been released into
the world. Man has changed his plane of consciousness to a higher
plane.</p><p><br></p><p>India has lived for many centuries in poverty, and when you live in
poverty, and when you live in starvation, and when you are ill, the only
way to console your ego is to condemn life. Try to understand it; it is
a rationalization - life-condemnation is a rationalization.</p><p>It is the same story that you know: the famous fable of Aesop.</p><p><br></p><p>A fox was trying to reach the grapes, but the grapes were too high
and he could not reach them. He looked around - there was nobody -
because he was afraid if somebody looked and saw that he had failed, it
would be against his prestige. Seeing that there was nobody, he walked
away. But a hare was hiding behind a bush and looking, and the hare
said, "Uncle, where are you going? What happened? Could you not reach?
Were the grapes too high?"</p><p>And the fox said, "No."</p><p>And you know the fox represents the politician. Down the ages, in all
the cultures, the fox represents the diplomat, the politician. The fox
is the most cunning animal.</p><p>The fox said, "No. They were perfectly within reach, but they are
sour and not yet worth reaching." This has been the logic here in this
country for two thousand years. Life became unreachable. The only way to
save face was to condemn it: it is sour, it is not of worth.</p><p>Chandrakand, drop all that nonsense! Life is beautiful, life is
tremendously graceful. All is good. Even that which does not appear to
be good on the surface has goodness in it. It can't be otherwise. In
fact, the thorns are not against the flowers; they are guards,
bodyguards for the flower. And pain is not against pleasure, it is the
background. Without it there would be no pleasure.</p><p>In the night you see the sky full of stars; where do those stars go
in the day? The background disappears. They need the background of
darkness; only then can you see them. In the day the background is not
there, it is fully light. The stars are still there in the sky, they
don't go anywhere. It is not that they suddenly run away in the day and
by the evening they come back. They are there; just</p><p>the background of darkness is needed for them to shine forth.</p><p>Life depends on the polar opposites: good and bad, love and hate,
body-mind, matter-God. Nothing is bad, nothing is good. Between good and
had, you have to grow; between good and bad, you have to mature - and
both are opportunities, great opportunities. Don't condemn them. Respect
life, and life will respect you. Love life and love will shower
blessings on you.</p><p><br></p><p>The fifth question:</p><p><br></p><p>OSHO, I THOUGHT THAT MEDITATION WAS A SIMPLE THING. BUT SEEING PEOPLE
DOING VIPASSANA, I AM LOSING ALL HOPE OF EVER BECOMING A SUCCESSFUL
MEDITATOR. PLEASE GIVE ME A LITTLE ENCOURAGEMENT.</p><p><br></p><p>Paul,</p><p>Meditation is simple. Precisely because it is simple, it looks
difficult. Your mind is accustomed to dealing with difficult problems,
and it has completely forgotten how to respond to the simple things of
life. The more simple a thing is, the more difficult it looks to the
mind, because the mind is very efficient in solving difficult things. It
has been trained to solve difficult things; it does not know how to
tackle the simple. Meditation is simple, your mind is complex. It is not
a problem that meditation is creating. The problem is coming from your
mind, not from meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>Vipassana is the simplest meditation in the world. It is through
vipassana that Buddha became enlightened, and it is through vipassana
that many more people have become enlightened than through any other
method. Vipassana is the method. Yes, there are other methods also, but
they have helped only very few people. Vipassana has helped thousands,
and it is really very simple; it is not like yoga.</p><p>Yoga is difficult, arduous, and complex. You have to torture yourself
in many ways: distort your body, contort your body, sit this way and
that, torture, stand on your head - exercises and exercises… but yoga
seems to be very appealing to people.</p><p><br></p><p>Vipassana is so simple that you don't take any note of it. In fact,
coming across vipassana for the first time, one doubts whether it can be
called a meditation at all. What is it? - no physical exercise, no
breathing exercise; a very simple phenomenon: just watching your breath
coming in, going out... finished, this is the method; sitting silently,
watching your breath coming in, going out; not losing track, that's all.
Not that you have to change your breathing - it is not pranayam; it is
not a breathing exercise where you have to take deep breaths, exhale,
inhale, no. Let the breathing be simple, as it is. You just have to
bring one new quality to it: awareness.</p><p>The breath goes out, watch; the breath comes in, watch. You will
become aware: the breath touching your nostrils at one point, you will
become aware. You can concentrate there: the breath comes in, you feel
the touch of the breath on the nostrils; then it goes out, you feel the
touch again. Remain there at the tip of the nose. It is not that you
have to concentrate at the tip of the nose; you have just to be alert,
aware, and watchful. It is not concentration. Don't miss, just go on
remembering. In the beginning you will miss again and again; then bring
yourself back. If it is difficult for you - for a few people it is
difficult to watch it there - then they can watch the breath in the
belly. When the breath goes in, the belly goes up; when the breath goes
out, the belly goes in. You go on watching your belly. If you have a
really good belly, it will help.</p><p><br></p><p>Have you watched? If you see Indian statues of Buddha, those statues
don't have real bellies - in fact,</p><p>no belly at all. Buddha looks a perfect athlete: chest coming out,
belly in. But if you see a Japanese statue of Buddha you will be
surprised: it does not look buddhalike at all - a big belly, so big that
you cannot see the chest at all, almost as if Buddha is pregnant, all
belly. The reason why this change happened is that in India, while
Buddha was alive, he himself was watching the breath at the nose; hence
the belly was not important at all. But as Vipassana moved from India to
Tibet to China to Korea to Burma to Japan, slowly, slowly people became
aware that it is easier to watch in the belly than at the nose. Then
Buddha-statues started becoming different, with bigger bellies.</p><p>You can watch either at the belly or at the nose, which-ever feels
right for you or whichever feels easier for you. That it be easier is
the point. And just watching the breath, miracles happen.</p><p><br></p><p>Paul, meditation is not difficult. It is simple. Precisely because it
is simple you are feeling the difficulty. You would like to do many
things, and there is nothing to do; that is the problem. It is a great
problem, because we have been taught to do things. We ask what should be
done, and meditation means a state of non-doing: you have not to do
anything, you have to stop doing. You have to be in a state of utter
inaction. Even thinking is a kind of doing - drop that too. Feeling is a
kind of doing - drop that too. Doing, thinking, feeling - all gone, you
simply are. That is being. And being is meditation. It is very
simple.</p><p>In your mother's womb you were in the same space. In vipassana you
will be entering again into the same space. And you will remember; you
will have a deja-vu. When you enter into deep vipassana, you will be
surprised that you know it, you have known it before. You will recognize
it immediately because for nine months in your mother's womb you were in
the same space, doing nothing, just being.</p><p>You ask me, "I thought that meditation was a simple thing, but seeing
people doing vipassana I am losing all hope of ever becoming a
successful meditator."</p><p>Never think about meditation in terms of success, because that is
bringing your achieving mind into it, the egoistic mind into it. Then
meditation becomes your ego-trip. Don't think in terms of success or
failure. Those terms are not applicable in the world of meditation.
Forget all about that. Those are mind terms; they are comparative. And
that's the problem: you must be watching others succeeding, reaching,
ecstatic, and you will be feeling very low. You will be feeling silly,
sitting and looking at your breath, watching your breath. You must be
looking very silly and nothing is happening. Nothing is happening
because you are expecting something to happen too much.</p><p>And in the beginning, every new process looks difficult. One has to
learn the taste of it.</p><p><br></p><p>A lady's husband was a souse, yet she had never in her life tasted
alcohol.</p><p>"Here, you souse, give me that bottle. I want to taste whatever it is
that has made you the bum you are." Taking the bottle of cheap whiskey,
she took a good gulp of it.</p><p>"Aargh... glompf. ... breecch... fuy... brrrit ... ptui!" she gasped.
"That is the most vile-tasting liquid I have ever had the misfortune to
let pass my lips. It tastes terrible!"</p><p>"Y'see?" said the old man. "An' all these years you thought I was
having a good time."</p><p>Just wait a little, Paul. Just a little patience. In the beginning
everything looks difficult, even the simplest thing. And don't be in a
hurry. That is one of the problems with the Western mind - hurry. People
want everything immediately. They think in terms of instant coffee,
instant meditation, instant enlightenment.</p><p><br></p><p>A city slicker had just inherited a farm full of cows and, being a
shrewd operator, decided to increase his herd right away. Accordingly,
he imported three of the finest bulls in the area and locked them in the
barn overnight with the cows. The next morning he called the owner of
the bulls to complain. The stud-man laughed. "What did you expect?" he
asked. Did you think you'd find calves the next day?" "Maybe not,"
retorted the city slicker. "But I sure did expect to see a few smiling
faces on those cows!"</p><p>No, not even that is going to happen soon. Just sitting for one day
in vipassana, you will not come out of it smiling. You will come out
utterly tired - tired because you were told not to do anything, tired
because you have never been in such a silly thing ever before. Not doing
anything? You are a doer! If you had chopped wood the whole day you
would not have been so tired. But sitting silently, doing nothing, just
watching your silly breath going in, coming out… many times the idea
arises, "What am I doing here?" And the time will look very, very long,
because time is relative. The time will become very long. One day's
meditation will look as if years and years have passed. “And what has
happened? Is not the sun going to set today? When is it going to
finish?"</p><p>If you are in a hurry, if you are in haste, you will never know the
taste of meditation. The taste of meditation needs great patience,
infinite patience. Meditation is simple, but you have become so complex
that to relax it will take time. It is not the meditation that is taking
time - let me remind you again - it is your complex mind. It has to be
brought down to a rest, to a relaxed state. That takes time.</p><p><br></p><p>And don't think in terms of success and failure. Enjoy! Don't be too
goal-oriented. Enjoy the sheer silence of watching your breath coming
in, going out, and soon you will have a beauty, a new experience of
beauty and beatitude. Soon you will see that one need not go anywhere to
be blissful.</p><p>One can sit silently, be alone, and be blissful. Nothing else is
needed; just the pulsation of life is enough. If you can pulsate with
it, it becomes a deep inner dance. Meditation is a dance of your energy,
and breath is the key.</p><p><br></p><p>The last question:</p><p><br></p><p>OSHO, I ALWAYS WONDER WHY PEOPLE MISUNDERSTAND YOU. I HAVE NEVER COME
ACROSS SUCH A SIMPLE APPROACH AS YOURS IN MY WHOLE LIFE OF SEEKING THE
WAY.</p><p>Ramananda,</p><p>People are bound to misunderstand. It is expected. It is nothing
unexpected, because what I am saying is not according to their
tradition. What I am saying is according to Buddha, Krishna, Christ,
Kabir, Farid, Bahaudin, Zarathustra, Lao Tzu, but not according to any
tradition. These people are not part of any tradition. These are
Himalayan peaks, alone. A Zarathustra is a Zarathustra and a Buddha is a
Buddha. They don't belong to any country and they don't belong to any
tradition, and they don't belong to any race, color, religion. They
simply belong to God. They simply belong to the whole. And whenever such
people are there they are bound to be misunderstood, because the
tradition that priests create, that scholars create, that politicians
support - the tradition which is a conspiracy against man's freedom - is
bound to retaliate, react.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not an accident that Jesus is crucified; the real accident is
why Buddha is not crucified. It is understandable why Socrates is
poisoned; the more problematic thing is why Lao Tzu is not poisoned. How
did they manage to escape? Maybe the only reason was that Lao Tzu was
very mild in his expression, hence nobody bothered much about him.
Socrates was not mild; his expression was very strong. He was like a
sword, sharp. He could not be tolerated.</p><p>Buddha could be tolerated, of course with difficulty. Stones were
thrown at him, mad elephants were released to kill him, rocks were
rolled down from the hill to crush him, but still he was not crucified
like Jesus. The reason may be that his expression was very, very silent.
His expression was very polite, his expression was very poetic. Jesus
spoke in words of fire; Jesus spoke in terms of utter rebellion. Buddha
was also a rebellion, but a very sophisticated rebellion; Jesus was raw,
Buddha was too cultured. Naturally, it had to be so: Buddha came from
the royal family, very cultured, educated, mild, all manners, etiquette.
Jesus was the son of a carpenter. He had that same raw quality of wood,
and</p><p>the same smell of raw wood.</p><p>But one thing is certain: that whenever a man like Buddha or Jesus or
Lao Tzu is there, he is bound to be misunderstood, because the crowd
belongs to the tradition, to a certain tradition: Hindu, Mohammedan,
Christian, Jew, Jaina, Buddhist, and the tradition cannot tolerate any
new revelation. And the people are so full of knowledge, so full of
prejudice that they go on understanding in their own way. And because
they understand in their own way, it becomes a misunderstanding. It is a
very unconscious process. They don't want to misunderstand; they are not
deliberately trying to misunderstand me. They are trying to understand,
but they come with conclusions, already arrived at conclusions, a priori
conclusions. Hence whatsoever they hear is not what I say: their minds
distort it, change it, and give it a new color.</p><p><br></p><p>The farm had been mortgaged and their life's savings had gone to give
daughter a college education. Pa was driving the truck to the station to
call for her after graduation. She climbed in beside him, slipped an arm
through his and whispered, "I want to confess something, Pa. I ain't as
pure a girl any more." Pa dropped his face in his hands and wept bitter
tears. "After all the sacrifice me and Ma made for your education," he
sobbed, "you still say'ain't'?"</p><p>This is how a prejudiced mind functions.</p><p>Three young women were attending a class in logic, and the professor
stated he was going to test their ability at situation reasoning.</p><p>"Let us assume," he said, "that you are aboard a small craft alone in
the Pacific and you spot a vessel approaching you with several thousand
sex-starved sailors on board. What would you do in this situation to
avoid any problems?”</p><p>"I would attempt to turn my craft in the opposite direction," said
the redhead. "I would pass them, trusting to my knife to keep me safe,"
said the brunette.</p><p>"Frankly," murmured the blond, "I understand the situation but I fail
to see the problem."</p><p><br></p><p>It depends on you!</p><p>What I say is very rarely heard. To hear it, you will have to become
a disciple. To hear it, you will have to learn the art of learning. To
hear it, you will have to be receptive, in deep love and trust. If you
can put your mind aside, if you can listen to me in deep silence, in
great reverence and love, there is no possibility of misunderstanding.
Otherwise you are going to understand everything the way you can
understand. That is one of the problems with language: it is very good,
very adequate, communicating the ordinary things of life; the higher you
move, the more inadequate it becomes.</p><p><br></p><p>Cohen met Levy for the first time in years. "How are things, Levy?"
he asked his old friend. "I hear you got very rich here in America."</p><p>"I can't complain," the other replied. "I got a house and garden in
the country, an automobile, a wife, ten children, and money in the
bank."</p><p>Cohen, nettled, tried to soften the hurt of his friend's success.
"Well," he said, "after all, in a day what can you do that I can't? We
both eat, sleep and drink. What else is there in life?" "Aaah," said
Levy, "you call your life living? In the morning I get up, have a fine
breakfast, a good Perfecto cigar. Then I lay on my verandah. After that
I play a round of golf and come back with a healthy appetite for lunch.
When I finish I have another Perfecto and lay down on my verandah again.
I come to supper with an appetite like a wolf. After supper I smoke a
good long cigar, lay on my verandah again, and at nightgo to the
theatre, the opera, whatever I like."</p><p>"That's wonderful! And you don't do no work?" said Cohen, marveling.
On his return home, he told his wife of the encounter. "You know who I
met today?" he announced. "Levy, who came over on the ship with me. Is
that man rich! He's got a house and garden in the country, an
automobile, a wife, and ten children." Mrs. Cohen interrupted, "What is
his wife's name?"</p><p>"I don't know," said her husband, "but I think it is Verandah."</p></div></main><footer class=footer><span>&copy; 2024 <a href=https://osho.lol/>Osho - The complete works of Osho</a></span> ·

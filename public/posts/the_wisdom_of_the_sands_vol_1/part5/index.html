BUT THEN WHY DO THEY TEACH SO MANY TECHNIQUES?\nBecause of the larvae, the camels.\nThe camels need many methods. They can only trust in a method, they can only trust in technology. They are almost like machines, robots. They cannot have the vision of the beyond, and their hearts are not functioning yet. With the heart functioning they will become lions, and with the soul functioning they will become the children.\nIt is like this: larvae or camels need many methods. Lions need only one method, either love or awareness. And the child needs no method at all. The child is already at home; he need not arrive, he need not go anywhere.\nThe Sufis are the people on the path of love. Love has no techniques, love is enough unto itself – but the heart has to function for it. And the camel has no heart. And the larva has no idea of what heart is, what feeling is, what love is. He has never dreamt about it. The larva has never dreamt about being a caterpillar, just as the caterpillar has not dreamt about being a butterfly.\nTwo caterpillars were crawling across the grass when suddenly a butterfly flew over them. They looked up, and one nudged the other one and said, “You could not get me up in one of those things for a million dollars.”\nThe larva cannot trust that something is possible; nothing is possible. The larva lives in a closed world, behind the walls. Those walls have to be broken. Methods are needed to break those walls, to destroy that prison. The larva has almost to be dragged outside the prison, freedom has almost to be imposed upon it. It is afraid of freedom, it is afraid of wings, it is afraid of the sky. It keeps its eyes closed. It remains within itself, it does not relate, it does not believe that relationship is possible. And the world is full of larvae and camels.\nOut of compassion, out of love, Sufis talk about other methods. If you understand, then there is no need for any method. Then either there is awareness or love. One who follows awareness needs no other method – one is enough. One who follows love needs no awareness – one is enough. Awareness cleanses the mind, cleanses the thought process, cleanses your intelligence, and you arrive. Love cleanses your feelings, cleanses your heart, and you arrive.\nThe child needs no method at all. The child does not even need love or awareness; the child is love and awareness.\nSo it depends: if the Sufi is talking to a camel he will give methods; if the Sufi is talking to a lion he will give him awareness or love; and if the Sufi is talking to a child he will not say anything about what to do. There is no need for doing. Non-doing is enough, just being is enough.\nThe second question:\nQuestion 2\nWHAT CAN A GURU DO FOR YOU?\nThe question is from Vidya’s mother, Sigrid. She must be worried about Vidya, about what is happening to Vidya here. And, deep down, she is nagging Vidya and trying to take back. It is natural, nothing is wrong in it; a mother, after all, is a mother. The mother loves, cares, and because you love and you care you become afraid also – what is happening to your child here? Hence the question, “What can a guru do for you?”\nA guru can do two things: he can undo you and re-do you. He can destroy you and give you a new life. A guru is a cross and a resurrection.\nThose who come here and remain outsiders will only see the cross of the guru, because the resurrection is an inner experience. The cross is an outside thing.\nHave you not watched in the story of Jesus? – when he was crucified, thousands of people witnessed it. It was simple. There was no need for any inner insight to witness Jesus being crucified. Thousands of people, ordinary people who had never seen Jesus, who had just come out of curiosity, all witnessed the crucifixion. But when Jesus got resurrected NOT EVEN HIS OWN DISCIPLES could recognize him immediately. Mary Magdalene was the first to recognize. That is symbolic: that means you need a feminine heart, an intuitive heart, to recognize resurrection.\nThen Jesus went to find his disciples. They had all escaped thinking, “Now all is finished!” They waited, hiding behind the crowds. They had waited for the moment because they were hoping that some miracle would happen. The miracle DID happen, but to see the miracle these ordinary eyes are not enough. These ordinary eyes can only see the UNdoing. To see the re-doing you will need another kind of eyes. The miracle DID happen, I say to you! – but nobody could see it because nobody was ready to see it, nobody was mature enough to see it.\nJesus went in search of his disciples after his resurrection. He found two disciples; they were going to another village. He walked with them for four miles, talked with them for four miles, and they did not recognize him. This seems to be so improbable, but it happened. He was walking with them, he was talking with them, and they could not see who had come. They thought he was a stranger. In fact, Jesus remained a stranger to these people even when he was alive. Their recognition was superficial.\nSo those who come here just as outsiders will simply see demolishing, will simply see undoing, will simply see that people are being destroyed, mind-washed, hypnotized – and they will see all kinds of things, all kinds of negative things. They will not be able to see the positive. For the positive you will have to become part, a participant. You will have to fall en rapport with me. You will have to come within me and you will have to allow me within you; then you will be able to see what a Master can do.\nIf you really want to understand it, then become a disciple! Then come closer to a Master. And I am not saying to come closer to me, but any Master! Go and find your Master, but come closer. Understanding one Master, you will have understood all Masters, past, present and future, because the work is the same. The work is to destroy the disciple so much so that the disciple disappears as a disciple and appears as a Master in his own right. That’s what a Master can do: he can make you a Master.\nThe third question:\nQuestion 3\nLISTENING TO YOU, DRINKING YOU SO DEEPLY EVERY DAY, I AM GETTING RIDICULOUSLY INTOXICATED. IF EEL READY TO QUIT MY SECURE AND MADDENING JOB AND FACE AN UNKNOWN FUTURE. BUT I HAVE BEEN DRUNK BEFORE AND ALWAYS WOKE UP WITH A HANGOVER AND THE SAME OLD SHIT TO DEAL WITH. IS IT POSSIBLE I COULD WAKE UP ONE DAY AND BE LEFT WITH JUST A HANGOVER FROM YOU?\nAnanda Buddha, this is a totally different kind of intoxication. It is so different that I can say to you that you are absolutely inexperienced about it.\nBeing intoxicated with me does not make you fall asleep, so you cannot wake up some day with a hangover. It makes you fall awake, so there is no question of waking up sometime with a hangover. Being with me is the awakening. What other awakening are you talking about?\nThis intoxicant drowns you only as far as the ego is concerned, but not your consciousness. It drowns you only as far as the personality is concerned, but not the individuality. It helps you to wake\nup from the personality and to wake up in the individuality. Right now you are asleep about your individuality and you are awake in your personality.\nLet us say it in this way: you have fallen asleep and you are seeing a dream. In the dream you are awake – you are going to the market to purchase a few things for shopping or something. In the dream you are awake. If in the dream you fall asleep, you will be REALLY awake. But in the dream you are awake; really you are fast asleep, you are snoring.\nYour awakening right now, Buddha, is not real awakening. You are in a deep sleep, a slumber, and dreaming a thousand and one dreams. If you allow me to hit you you will wake up for the first time. Your dreams will disappear, your sleep will be broken, and you will come to know for the first time who you are. Once you have tasted that awakening you cannot fall asleep again. That taste is such – it permeates your whole being, it pervades you, it overwhelms you, it encompasses you. This intoxication is just to help you to fall awake.\nThat’s why I have given you the name Swami Ananda Buddha: blissful awareness, blissful awakening. You ARE asleep, and the potential is there – you can fall awake. And the first stirrings are felt by you.\nTake the risk! In your dream-world nothing is secure, not even your so-called secure job. In your so-called world nothing is certain. The dream-world cannot be certain – it is a flux, everything is changing and moving. Today you are in a secure job, tomorrow you may not be in it. Today you are living with a woman, tomorrow she is gone. Today you have a beautiful child, tomorrow God has taken it back. What is secure here?\nExcept awakening, nothing is secure here. All is just... hallucination, all is just... deceiving yourself, creating newer and newer mirages. The oasis exists not! This world is a desert. The oasis exists in your awareness only. Create that oasis of awareness. And whatsoever is needed for it, do. Whatsoever price has to be paid, pay. Whatsoever has to be risked, risk – because all else is going to be taken away from you anyway. Death will come, and your job and your wife and your children and your name and fame – all will be taken away. Before death comes search for awareness, because those who become aware in life, for them, death never comes. They become deathless. They know what immortality is. Because in your awareness you come to know not the body, but the one who resides in it.\nThe fourth question:\nQuestion 4\nEVEN THOUGH I DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS HAPPENING, I HAVE HAD ENLIGHTENING EXPERIENCES THROUGH THE USE OF HALLUCINOGENIC DRUGS. I KNOW THAT LSD IS FALSE, BUT WHAT IS, IF ANY, THE TRUTH ABOUT MUSHROOMS?\nThe question is from Reese Guth.\nLSD is not false, LSD is as real as anything else. But the experience that is created by LSD is a FALSE samadhi. Remember the distinction that I am making: LSD is not false, but the experience that is created under the impact of LSD is a false experience.\nYou say, “I HAVE HAD ENLIGHTENING EXPERIENCES...”\nThey were not enlightening experiences. They may have been lightning experiences, but not enlightening – flashes; you are not enlightened through them, you don’t become a Buddha through them. In fact you become more of a mess out of them. The LSD changes your body chemistry, as mushrooms do. It changes your body chemistry. It does not change you, it changes your body – just as food changes your body, air changes your body, climate changes your body, the moon, the full moon changes your body, but you are not being changed by it. All those changes happen in the body, all those changes are chemical changes – not alchemical but only chemical. What is an alchemical change? – when your consciousness changes. And the consciousness cannot be changed by ANYTHING that comes from the outside.\nThe consciousness cannot be changed by food, eating this food or that. The consciousness cannot be changed by non-eating, by fasting. Remember, there is not much difference between people who take LSD and the people who go on a long fast, no difference! Both are trying to change the body chemistry. The people who take mushrooms and other drugs are not doing anything different from the people who do yoga exercises, because in both ways the BODY is changed. The change is not happening in consciousness. Consciousness REMAINS BEYOND all chemicals.\nIf you fast long enough, naturally your body chemistry can’t be the same. A few things disappear from your body chemistry and a few things accumulate too much. Your body has a different combination of chemicals.\nAfter a one month long fast you will feel beautiful things, but those beautiful things are created by the chemical change. Start eating and those beautiful things will disappear. You do certain yoga postures continuously, for years, pressing your body structure at certain points, certain important points, pressing your body meridians at certain junctures continuously; it changes your body chemistry. Breathe in a certain way for years, always in a certain way – it changes your body chemistry, because the oxygen and the carbon dioxide balance will be changed by your breathing.\nHave you not noticed it? – when you are angry you breathe in a different way? Why? That different way of breathing releases some chemicals in your body which are helpful to being angry. If you don’t breathe in a different way you will not be able to be angry. Try it: breathe in the Buddhist way and you will not be able to go into anger, because the Buddhist way won’t allow your body chemicals to be released which are needed for the anger.\nYou are afraid? You breathe in a different way. Different chemicals are needed, because a man who is frightened needs to escape fast, as fast as possible. He needs flight, certain chemicals are needed so he can flee fast. When you are in sexual passion your breathing changes. Continue to breathe normally and you will not be able to achieve orgasm. For the orgasm to be triggered a certain kind of breathing is needed.\nBut these changes are physical; these are not going to affect your consciousness. The consciousness is the witness to all changes. Just try to understand.\nYou are hungry, feeling hungry: the body is hungry, the consciousness simply notes the fact that the body is hungry. The consciousness is never hungry, cannot be hungry; it has no stomach. It can only\nbe a witness. Consciousness is nothing but witnessing. Remember this formula: consciousness is witnessing. You are hungry? The consciousness reflects the hunger. It is like a mirror: it says “The body is hungry.” When you have eaten and your body is satisfied, the consciousness says “The body is satisfied.” The consciousness was not hungry and is not satisfied either. In both cases the consciousness was just witnessing – hunger/satisfaction, sexual passion/sexual contentment, anger/release of anger.\nYou take LSD or some other drug, and there are lightning experiences. Consciousness is simply waiting and watching. It simply says, “Look, beautiful things are happening,” but they are not happening to consciousness.\nThe spiritual growth is the growth of this witnessing! The spiritual growth has nothing to do with particular experiences. The spiritual growth is not a search for novel experiences. Spirituality has nothing to do with experiences as such. In fact to say any experience is ‘spiritual experience’ is utterly wrong, because all experiences are non-spiritual. THE EXPERIENCER IS THE SPIRIT. The witness is the only spiritual phenomenon. When all experiences have disappeared – of hunger, of satiety, of anger, of release, of love, of hate, of kundalini arising in you, chakras opening in you, lotuses opening in you, lights showering in you; celestial music is heard, you feel great space, you feel joy, you feel bliss, but these are all experiences – the real spiritual point is when there is NO experience, and the experiencer is left alone, utterly alone. There is no object to experience, but only this witness is there, silently witnessing nothing. Then you have arrived. This is SAMADHI. Witnessing nothing is SAMADHI. That’s why Buddha calls it NIRVANA, nothingness, emptiness.\nYour question is meaningful. And the question is not only concerned with psychedelic experiences, it is concerned with all kinds of experiences. Experiences AS SUCH are non-spiritual. When all experiences have gone and you don’t feel ANYTHING AT ALL, and you have not fallen asleep eitherIn sleep also those experiences disappear. In deep sleep, what Patanjali calls SUSHUPTI,\nwhere dreams are no more, all experiences disappear, but the experiencer is also absent. Patanjali says SUSHUPTI and SAMADHI are similar and yet very different, diametrically opposite. What is their similarity? The similarity is that in both, experiences are not found. And what is their difference? In SUSHUPTI, in deep sleep, the experiencer is also not found. In SAMADHI experiences are gone but the experiencer is sitting there silently watching nothing, witnessing nothing. This is enlightenment! Experiences can be lightning experiences, can be beautiful experiences, can give you great joy, but still they are not enlightenment.\nEnlightenment is when the light is there and it falls on nothing. The light fills nothingness, no object is seen in that light – this is liberation. To be liberated from experiences is to be liberated from the world. ‘The world’ means ALL kinds of experiences, what the Chinese call ‘the ten thousand experiences’ – that’s what the world consists of.\nYou say, “EVEN THOUGH I DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS HAPPENING, I HAVE HAD ENLIGHTENING EXPERIENCES THROUGH THE USE OF HALLUCINOGENIC DRUGS. I KNOW THAT LSD IS FALSE BUT WHAT IS, IF ANY, THE TRUTH ABOUT MUSHROOMS?”\nThe truth is they can give you beautiful trips, and ugly trips too. They can give you golden dreams, and nightmares too. It all depends on you.\nThe drug only triggers a process. Whatsoever dream is ready to explode in you will be exploded, hence contradictory experiences have been reported.\nAldous Huxley reports that he experienced heaven, and Karl Rahner reports he experienced hell. Now Karl Rahner is against drugs and Aldous Huxley is all for the drugs. If you are all for the drugs your very prejudice will help you to create beautiful experiences. You will be waiting and hoping for something beautiful to happen, your belief will do the magic. If you are against from the very beginning, suspicious, doubtful, afraid, and you know that you are going to have some hellish experience through it, it will be created.\nAn ancient Sufi saying says: Hell is preserved for those who believe in it. And heaven is also preserved for those who believe in it. But it’s all just make-believe. There is no hell, no heaven; you create your hell, you create your heaven. If you are in a kind of negative mood then take LSD and it will give you nightmares. If you are in a positive mood, flowing, loving, it will take you to paradise.\nThe ancient-most drug takers have been in India. India knows more about drugs than any other country. At least for ten thousand years ninety-nine percent of Indian sannyasins have been taking drugs, from the RIG-VEDAS till today, from SOMA to LSD. India knows much, India has created technologies, techniques, methodologies of how to take a drug. The drug trip should be a very guided trip; it needs a guide. The guide creates the atmosphere, he creates the idea. Slowly, slowly he goes on hypnotizing you about what is happening. And in a drug state a person becomes very suggestible, absolutely suggestible; all reason is lost. The dream faculty starts functioning, imagination is let loose. Now, imagination can do both – either it can create hell or heaven. You need a guide. The guide slowly, slowly guides you towards heaven, heavenly experiences. He creates a beautiful dream, a poetic dream around you; and you are in a suggestible state, you simply fall a victim.\nBut guided or unguided, a drug experience or a fasting experience – all are false. EXPERIENCE IS FALSE.\nSAMADHI is when the witness has remained alone, witnessing nothing. That is the TRUE spiritual experience, if you will allow me to call it experience. It is not experience, because in experience you need three things: the experiencer, the experienced and the experience. There are not three things left at all. There is only one witness, witnessing utter nothingness, SHUNYA, emptiness. That is true experience.\nThe true experience is a ‘no-experience’. And when you attain to a no-experience, only then believe that it is enlightening. Otherwise lightning experiences will come and go, flashes of the mind, dream- stuff.\nThe fifth question:\nIS TO BE A SANNYASIN A MOMENT OR A PROCESS? IS A GURU REALLY NEEDED TO BE a SANNYASIN? IF A GURU LIVES IN SOMEBODY’S HEART ALL THE TIME, THEN WHAT IS THE NECESSITY OF WEARING ORANGE AND THE MALA ALL THE TIME? WAS EKLAVYA NOT A REAL DISCIPLE?\nThe question is from Kartik. The question is from some Indian mind, some Indian. Many things have to be understood.\nFirst you ask, “IS TO BE A SANNYASIN A MOMENT OR A PROCESS?”\nIt is both, because it is a beginning of a great pilgrimage – so it is an event, a moment, and also a process. By becoming a sannyasin you have not arrived, you have only started arriving. It is a great moment because it is a quantum leap from your ordinary mundane world, from the search for power, prestige. You have moved to seek and search for truth. From moving outwards, into the world, you have taken a decision to move inwards. From the external your being is turning towards the internal. It is a great moment, because interiority is born in it! It is a great change in your pattern of life, in your style of life: you will never be the same again. It is a drastic change, it is a discontinuity – the past is dropped and you start creating yourself anew – but it is also a process because this is just a beginning. You have started moving inwards, but you will have to go on moving.\nLao Tzu says, “The journey of ten thousand miles starts in the first step.” The first step is a great moment. Just thing: the larva becomes the caterpillar... a great moment, because the larva was static, and the caterpillar moves, crawls. The caterpillar is not yet a butterfly. It knows nothing of flying, it knows nothing of flowers, it is not yet a winged thing, but the journey has started. The journey of ten thousand miles – the first step has been taken. it has started crawling. If crawling is possible, then one day flying will also be possible.\nThe larva cannot become the butterfly, only the caterpillar can become the butterfly. The worldly man cannot arrive in his being, only a sannyasin can arrive. The sannyasin is between the larva and the butterfly, the link.\nSo a sannyasin is both the beginning of a journey and a process; it is a moment and a process. You ask, “IS A GURU REALLY NEEDED TO BE A SANNYASIN?”\nYou need me even to ask this question! You can’t answer it yourself. How are you going to answer greater questions? – because this is a very silly and stupid question, not of any worth. If I am answering it, it is just to respect you, to respect a camel.\nIf you cannot answer a silly, ordinary question like this yourself, how are you going to become a sannyasin on your own?\nThe caterpillar will need a butterfly. Seeing the butterfly flying around, enjoying flowers and the honey and enjoying the sunshine will be needed, is a must. That will create a desire, a longing, a thirst in the caterpillar. It will create a dream, a dream which can become a reality. Unless the caterpillar starts dreaming, there is no possibility. How will you start dreaming about unknown things? You have not known them! You can dream only about that which you have known. You can think about a thing which you have experienced in the past: how will you think about God, about truth, about NIRVANA, about SAMADHI? These are empty words for you, utterly empty of any meaning, meaningless jargon. You will have to come in contact with a person in whom SAMADHI IS alive, throbbing, beating, breathing. You will have to come in close contact with a person in whom truth is born, in whom you can have a glimpse of God; that’s all that is needed. You will have to\ncome in contact with someone where the disease called God can become infectious. You will have to move with a drunkard. Seeing his joy, seeing his blissfulness and his silence and his calm and his cool, you may become thirsty, thirsty for something you have never tasted before.\nThat’s what a Master is all about. If you can do it on your own, it is so kind of you. Do it. Read American books, ‘do it’ books – do it yourself. But you will create more mess than you are in already. Out of your confusion, whatsoever you will do, more confusion will come.\nYou are already a crowd, falling apart. You cannot put yourself together. And I am not saying that it does not happen sometimes; it happens sometimes: there have been people who have put themselves together. But those people are exceptional, and they don’t come here to ask questions like this.\nOnce a young man came to me and asked, “What do you say, Osho, about marriage? Should I get married or not? I am a seeker, a searcher for truth.” I told him, “You please get married.” But he said, “But this is very unexpected! Why didn’t you get married? I have come to you because I knew you would say, ‘No, don’t get married.’ Why didn’t you get married?” I said, “Because I never went to ask anybody, that has not been my way. I have never asked any question of anybody.”\nYou are tricky. You want to have the answer, you want guidance, and yet you don’t want to commit yourself. You want all guidance cheaply.\nI have never asked a single question of anybody. That’s why when I was in the university my professors were very angry with me – because I was always answering them, not questioning. Very angry, naturally! If you answer a professor he becomes angry. I was turned out from many colleges, expelled, and the only crime that I had committed was that I was answering. Even if I was asking, the question was such that it was really an answer, not a question. The professors were angry. They wanted questions so that they could answer, because answers they knew.\nIf you are searching for truth, if you have moved into the search, you will need a Master. And remember, I repeat again: it is not that it cannot happen alone. It has happened to me alone, so how can I say that it cannot happen alone? Lao Tzu says, “You need not go out of your house, you need not even open your windows and doors, and all can be found there sitting inside your room.” And he is right, but it happens very rarely.\nYou are being cunning: you want the guidance, and you don’t want to bow down to a Master.\nYou ask me, “IF A GURU LIVES IN SOMEBODY’S HEART ALL THE TIME,, THEN WHAT IS THE NECESSITY OF WEARING ORANGE AND THE MALA ALL THE TIME?”\nThen there is no necessity. Then there is no necessity even to ask this question! If a guru lives for twenty-four hours in your heart, you have become a Buddha Even to remember your guru for twenty-four seconds continuously is impossible. What are you talking about? – twenty-four hours?\nTry to remember me for twenty-four seconds. Just keep a wristwatch in front of you and try to remember me for twenty-four seconds, and twenty-four thousand times you will miss. A second will pass and you will start thinking of your girlfriend, or what movie to go to today. And then you will\nhave to pull back. Again you will remember, “What am I doing? – five seconds have passed. And for one second you may be able just to remember, so-so, lukewarm, and again it is lost. Just try for twenty-four seconds. If you can remember me continuously for twenty-four seconds, without a single distraction, you need not have any orange, any mala I declare you a sannyasin.\nAnd you are saying ‘for twenty-four hours’ “If a guru LIVES IN SOMEBODY’S HEART ALL THE TIME, THEN WHAT IS THE NECESSITY OF WEARING ORANGE AND THE MALA ALL THE TIME?”\nBut if the guru that lives in your heart says “Wear orange”, what will you do then? Will you listen to the guru or not? What do you think about the people who are wearing orange here? Are they very willingly wearing orange? But the guru says so! What to do? And they have fallen in love with the guru Now the guru is mad and he says, “Wear orange!” The guru is eccentric. First you fall in love with the guru, and then the guru starts playing tricks on you. He says, “Wear orange, wear a mala, and look like a fool! And go into the world and let people laugh!”\nBut if the guru lives for twenty-four hours in your heart, you will be ready to commit suicide if he says to!\nAnd then you ask, “WAS EKLAVYA NOT A REAL DISCIPLE?”\nI will have to tell you the story first; only then will you be able to understand it.\nYou know of the Bhagavad-Gita, of Krishna the Master and his disciple Arjuna. When Arjuna was learning with Drona.In his student days, he was with a master archer, Drona. He was the greatest\nmaster archer in those days. Arjuna belonged to a royal family, so all the children from the royal family were learning with Drona, and Arjuna was the best disciple.\nDrona was a brahmin. Eklavya came; Eklavya was an untouchable, and Eklavya wanted to become a disciple also. Drona refused. A brahmin? How can he accept an untouchable, a sudra? That has been one of the greatest pathologies of the Hindu mind. The Hindu mind has been ill and unhealthy because of that. Notwithstanding so many great things that they have done, that one thing has undone all their great things. They have condemned human beings so utterly that never before, anywhere in the world, have human beings been condemned so badly. And that is done by so- called religious people who claim that they are the greatest religious people of the world. And they have been doing something which is so ugly – millions of people have been debarred from being human beings. Eklavya belonged to those downtrodden, oppressed people. But he had a beautiful body, and Drona could see – because he was a great teacher – he could see that he could become one of the most famous archers in the world. He could see directly: the way he walked, the way he talked, his one-pointed mind, his concentrated being – Drona could see that this young man could become the best archer of that age. “But then what will happen to my disciple, Arjuna? And he’s going to be the king”.now, the vested interest. He refused. He refused for two reasons: one. “You\nare a sudra and I am a brahmin; I cannot accept you. Even the shadow of a sudra is unacceptable.” Brahmins have been taking baths if the shadow of a sudra would fall on them. The shadow! He need not have touched anyone. And these are spiritual people! And the shadow is non-existential. If you are sitting and a sudra passes by and his shadow touches you, you have to take a a bath. You have been polluted by his being.\nAnd these sudras are not sinners. They are simply poor people, exploited people, the proletariat.\n“First, you are a sudra so I cannot accept,” said Drona. In saying that, he also said that he was not a spiritual man at all. He may have been a great master archer, but he was not a spiritual Master, he was not a guru. In denying Eklavya, he proved that he was not a guru, because a guru cannot deny anybody. Even if a sinner comes, the guru cannot deny. That is what he exists for.\nSometimes people come to me and they say, “We are not worthy. We are sinners. We have done this wrong and that. Osho, will you accept us?” And I say, “For whom do I exist here?” If the doctor says to the patient, “I cannot accept you because you have so many illnesses,” then what is the point of that doctor? Why is he there if he accepts only healthy men?\nDrona was not a guru, not a spiritual Master. He must have been a very ugly politician. It was on the surface that he said, “I cannot accept because you are a sudra”, but deep down this was the reasoning: that if this Eklavya were accepted and he became a great archer, what would happen to his favorite disciple? “And the favorite disciple is going to become the king, not Eklavya. With the favorite disciple my whole future is involved. If Arjuna becomes the king then I will be the master of the king, and naturally powerful, even more powerful than the king. The king will touch my feet, and my order will be THE order.” He wanted Arjuna to remain the greatest archer; Eklavya was denied.\nEklavya went into the forest, but his love for archery was such that he created a statue of Drona and started practicing before the statue. Soon rumors started coming to Drona’s school that Eklavya was attaining... alone, without any guidance from Drona. But his totality was such that even the statue was enough.\nAnd one day the news came that Arjuna was no longer a competent archer before Eklavya. Drona went to see Eklavya, and he committed one thing which can never be forgiven. He went there and he asked Eklavya to show him, and he saw, and it was absolutely certain that Arjuna was no longer a comparison to Eklavya. Eklavya had far transcended Arjuna and all his disciples; in fact, had far transcended Drona himself. Now he said, “You have learned through me by making my statue. You will have to give me some present, DAKSHINA.” When a disciple has learned all from the Master, just in gratitude he gives some gift to the Master, any symbolic gift. Eklavya started crying and weeping. He said, “But I have nothing! You can ask anything!” And Drona asked for his thumb, his right-hand thumb. He cut off his thumb immediately and gave it to Drona. He asked the right-hand thumb because without it he would never be an archer again.\nNow this fellow, Drona, is an ugly spot on Hindu consciousness. He was not a spiritual Master at all. He was a very, very low politician, a diplomat. He may have been a good archer but that doesn’t make anybody spiritual. First he had denied Eklavya, and now he went... what CHUTZPAH! now he went and asked that something be given to him as a gift: “I am your Master.” He had denied his being a disciple, and now he went and said that “I am your Master.”\nEklavya is really rare. Such a great soul; Drona is not even worthy enough to touch his feet. He didn’t say anything. He could have said,“You have denied me”, but he didn’t say that. That idea never arose in his mind. He had trusted him as the Master even if he had been denied. He had loved him and he was ready to give anything. He gave his right-hand thumb, became a cripple forever and was no longer heard of. Since that moment nothing is known about Eklavya, about what happened. He\nmust have gone to the forest, must have lived in his tribe, sweeping streets. He must have forgotten all about archery – a great archer destroyed.\nNow this is the story.\nKartik has asked, “WAS EKLAVYA NOT A REAL DISCIPLE?”\nEklavya was a real disciple, Drona was not a real guru.\nBut you should not ask this question, because you simply want to avoid the mala and orange. And Eklavya, even if denied by the Master, although rejected by the Master, went into the forest and created an image of the Master. You should not bring Eklavya’s name into it. You are just the opposite!\nWhat is the mala? – an image.\nThere the Master had denied, here the Master is ready to accept you. Even though denied by the Master, Eklavya created an image of the Master and through that image attained. You should not bring Eklavya in with your question. It is contradictory, it contradicts you. It does not prove that you are right, it simply proves you are UTTERLY wrong. Even a man like Eklavya could not do without the image! It was needed, it helped, it created a certain milieu, it created an atmosphere, a climate. And if love is total then the mala is not dead. Then it is not wood, it is your heart. Then the image in the mala is not just a picture. It depends on your love: how much love you pour into it, that much life it will have. And it is needed. It creates a climate around you, and only in a certain climate will you be able to bloom.\nThe sixth question:\nQuestion 5\nAS ONE EVOLVES SPIRITUALLY, INTEREST IN SEX MAY BECOME LESS STRONG. SO IF I’M NOT SO SEXY THESE DAYS AM I GETTING OLDER OR CLOSER TO ENLIGHTENMENT?\nThere is a criterion to judge it: if your sexuality disappears and you become more loving, then it is not just old age. If with sexuality your loving quality also disappears, then it is old age.\nHave you not observed it? – old people become unloving, nagging, always angry, rude, oppressing, always finding excuses to torture, condemn. What happens? The moment one becomes less sexual, juices start drying up. Once the magic of desire fades, people become desert-like. All their greenness is of their sexuality and sensuality. All their flowering is that of:sex and nothing else. So once sex becomes less and less important, their greenery starts disappearing. They become non-communicative, they are always angry, and they are very much in their egos.\nNobody likes older people, even their own children. The reason is not old age, the reason is: once the magic of desire is gone they become rock-like. And once their own desire is gone, they become very jealous of others’ desires. An old person cannot tolerate you being in love. He’s always there with condemning eyes, because he says he knows it is all nonsense, because he says “I have lived it and I know it is all futile.” This happens to old people, this happens to old countries too.\nIf in Poona you find that you are condemned if you are moving hand in hand with your woman and people look with condemning eyes, that is just because the country has gone stale and old. It is a very old country, its magic of desire has died. It has no magic. It is dominated by the old people, it is non-accepting of the young. The old cannot accept the youth and the joy of youth – it hurts.\nSo this is the criterion: if you are simply becoming old you will not only become non-sexual, you will become dry, dull, dead, and you will start condemning other people who are still young. That’s a kind of revenge. Deep down it is jealousy: “How come my own desire is gone and people are still desiring? I am dying and you are loving? Death is coming closer every moment and you are still searching for a woman or a man, still singing and dancing?” It is unacceptable to the old people.\nBut if old age is not just aging but wisdom too, then there will be a totally different thing. The older person will feel very, very happy with people loving each other. He will have a blessing, a benediction always flowing through him. Whenever he will see somebody in love, his eyes will have a joy. He will bless them, because he knows each desire has its own time, and one learns only through experience. Yes, now he is disillusioned, and he knows perfectly well that when he was young his father was also disillusioned but he never listened. Now he knows, “My son is also not going to listen. And it is good that he should not listen, because if he listens he will never be able to live his youth.” And youth unlived penetrates old age. And when youth penetrates old age, the old age becomes dirty, ugly; it is impotent. Now you cannot live those experiences but they go on hammering inside your mind. They go on coming as dreams, desires. The body is no longer able to go into them but the mind continues. Sex becomes cerebral. And that is the most perverted state of sex, when it becomes cerebral. It should be genital, not cerebral – but the sexual mechanism is no longer functioning and the whole energy has moved into the head.\nIf a man has lived his childhood perfectly he will come out of it a grown-up man. If a man has lived his youth perfectly he will come out of it a grown-up old man – wise, happy, silent, calm, quiet, loving. With the disappearance of sex, love will not disappear. In fact, love will become more, because the energy that was involved in sex is no longer involved in sex; all that energy has become available for love. An old man can be as loving as NO young man can ever be, because the young have other interests.\nLove is really secondary for a young man; his whole interest is sex. When a young man is telling a girl, “I love you”, he’s just planning how to hop into the bed. All this is nonsense, he knows, but it has to be done, it is part of the game. If you ask a woman suddenly, “How about it?” she may scream or call the police; it is so unexpected. You have to persuade. And she is also thinking – if you go on persuading long enough, she becomes bored. If you go on saying, “I love you, I love you,” and there is no sign of hopping into the bed, she becomes fed-up. The introduction should not be too long. It should not be like George Bernard Shaw where the book consists of only a hundred pages and the introduction is two hundred pages. Who waits for the book then? An introduction is an introduction; it makes things easy.\nThe young man’s interest is sex, is not love. Love is an excuse, love is politeness, love is culture, sophistication, but his real interest is sex. Love is like sugar that we coat on bitter pills – that’s how the young man is interested. His real love is sex.\nIt is not incidental that the young people all over the world have started calling sex ‘making love’. That’s what their love is. Depth they cannot know. The young man is bound to remain shallow.\nSex is shallow, so a young man is shallow. Youth cannot have depth, and youth cannot have calm understanding. Youth is feverish, it is a tumultuous time. Good! I’m not saying it is wrong: it creates the possibility to grow. You have to pass through many experiences, sweet and bitter. You have to pass through many stages of feverishness, of ecstasy, of excitement; only then a moment comes when you start understanding. Those experiences prepare you, they cleanse you. You have to pass through the fire of youth to become the pure gold of old age. A really old man is wise, he has some light in him. He has lived his life, he has become ripe. He knows what life is: he knows its joys, its sorrows, its ups and downs, he knows its hells and its heavens. He has seen all. Seeing all, a great understanding has arisen in him, and a compassion and a love.\nSo this has to be the criterion: if with the disappearance of sex, at the same time, simultaneously, comes the appearance of love, compassion and understanding, then it is not just that you are growing old. You are Coming closer to enlightenment. But if it is not so, then you are simply growing old. Growing old is not a great qualification – everybody does it in his own time, it happens – but growing in wisdom is a qualification, certainly a qualification.\nI have heard.…\nA most attractive young girl was being interviewed by St. Peter at the Pearly Gates.\n“While you were on earth,” he asked, “did you indulge in promiscuity, smoking, dancing, or any other forms of wickedness?”\n“Never, never!” protested the girl.\n“Well, then why have you not reported sooner?” asked St. Peter. “You have been dead for years!” Remember, don’t die before your death! Remain alive.\nI have also heard...\nAn anthropologist in Java came across a little-known tribe with a strange funeral rite. When a man died, they buried him for sixty days and then dug him up. He was placed in a dark room on a cool slab, and twenty of the tribe’s most beautiful maidens danced erotic dances entirely in the nude around the corpse for three hours.\n“Why do you do this?” the anthropologist asked the chief of the tribe, who replied, “If he does not get up we are sure he is dead.”\nDon’t think that by becoming more and more dead you will be coming closer to enlightenment. Enlightenment is not a quality of death, it is a quality of RIPE LIFE, it is a quality of rich life. One who has lived his life in many, many ways, good and bad, as the sinner and the saint, one who has the experience of the varieties, of all possibilities, becomes ripe; and in that ripeness is richness, is glory.\nLet this be the criterion, always judge through this criterion: if love is growing, compassion is coming, understanding is growing, then you are on the right track. If with your sexuality love is dying, understanding is dying, compassion dying, then you are on the wrong track.\nThe last question:\nQuestion 6\nYOU REALLY CONFUSED ME WHEN YOU TALKED ABOUT THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN LOVE AND LIKING. YOU SAID LOVE IS COMMITTED, BUT I THOUGHT COMMITMENT WAS ANOTHER KIND OF ATTACHMENT. THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE I LOVE BUT I DON’T FEEL COMMITTED TO. HOW CAN I PREDICT IF I WILL LOVE THEM TOMORROW?\nThe question is significant. You will have to be very, very understanding, because it is subtle and complex too.\nWhen I said that love is commitment, what do I mean by it? I don’t mean that you have to promise for tomorrow, but the promise is there. You don’t have to promise, but the promise is there. This is the complexity and the subtleness of it. You don’t say, “I will love you tomorrow too”, but in the moment of love that promise is there, utterly present. It needs no expression.\nWhen you love a person you CAN’T think otherwise. You CAN’T think that you will not love this person some day; that is impossible, that is not part of love. And I am not saying that you may not be able to get out of this love-affair; you may be, you may not be. That is not the point. But when you are in the love moment, when the energy is flowing between two persons, there is a bridge, a golden bridge, and they are bridged through it. It simply does not happen: the mind cannot conceive and comprehend that there will be a time when you will not be with this person and this person will not be with you. This is commitment. Not that you say so much, not that you go to a court and make a formal statement: “I will remain forever with you.” In fact to make that formal statement simply shows there is no love; you need a legal arrangement. If the commitment is there, there is no need for any legal arrangement.\nMarriage is needed because love is missing. If love is there profoundly, marriage will not be needed. What is the point of marriage? – that is like putting legs on a snake, or painting a red rose red. It is unnecessary. Why go to the court? There must be some fear inside you... the love is not total.\nEven while in deep love you are thinking of the possibility that tomorrow you may desert this woman. The woman is thinking, “Who knows? Tomorrow this man may desert me. It is better to go to the court. First let it become legal, then one can depend.” But what does it show? – it simply shows that love is not total. Otherwise, total love has that quality of commitment on its own accord. It has not to be brought to it, it is its intrinsic quality.\nAnd when you are in love it comes naturally to you, not that you plan. This feeling comes naturally and sometimes in words too: “I will love you forever.” This is THIS moment’s depth. It doesn’t say anything about tomorrow, remember. It is not a promise. It is just that the depth and the totality of love is such that it comes automatically to you to say, “I will love you forever and ever. Even death will not be able to part us.” This is the feeling of total love.\nAnd let me repeat again – that does not mean that tomorrow you will be together. Who knows? That is not the point at all. Tomorrow will take care of itself. Tomorrow never enters into the mind which is in love. Tomorrow is not conceived at all, future disappears, this moment becomes eternity. This is commitment.\nAnd when tomorrow... it is possible you may not be together, but you are not betraying. You are not deceiving, You are not cheating. You will feel sad about it, you will feel sorry about it, but you have to depart. And I’m not saying that it has to happen; it may not happen. It depends on a thousand and one things.\nLife does not depend only on your love. If it were to depend only on your love then you would live for ever and ever. But life depends on a thousand and one things. Love has the feeling that “We will live together forever”, but love is not the whole of life. When it is there it is so intense, one is drunk with it. But then there are a thousand and one things, sometimes small things.\nYou may fall in love with a man, and in that moment you are ready to go to hell with him, and you can say so, and you are not cheating. You are utterly true and honest and you say, “If I have to go to hell with you I will go!” – and I say again, you are true, you are not saying anything false. But tomorrow, living with that man, small things – a dirty bathroom may disturb your affair. Hell is too far away, there is no need to go that far – a dirty bathroom! Or just a small habit: the man snores in the night and drives you crazy! And you were ready to go to hell, and that was true. It was authentic in that moment, it was not false, you had no other idea – but the man snores in the night; or his perspiration smells like hell, or he has bad breath and when he kisses you, you feel you are tortured. Just small things, very small things; one never thinks of them when one is in love. Who bothers about a bathroom, and who thinks about snoring? But when you live together with a person, a thousand and one things are involved, and any small thing can become a rock and can destroy the flower of love.\nSo I’m not saying that the commitment has any promise in it. I’m simply saying that the moment of love is a moment of commitment. You are utterly in it, it is so decisive. And naturally, out of this moment will come the next, so there is every possibility that you may be together. Out of today tomorrow will be born. It will not be coming from the blue, it will grow out of today. If today has been of great love, tomorrow will also carry the same love. It will be a continuity. So there is every possibility that you may love, but it is always a perhaps. And love understands that.\nAnd if one day you leave your woman or your woman leaves you, you will not start shouting at her, “What do you mean now? You had told me one day that ‘I will live always and always with you.’ Now what? Why are you going?” If you loved, if you had known love, you will understand. Love has that quality of commitment.\nLove is a mystery. When it is there, everything looks heavenly. When it is gone, everything looks simply stale, meaningless. You could not have lived without this woman, and now you cannot live with this woman. And both are authentic states.\nYou ask, “YOU REALLY CONFUSED ME WHEN YOU TALKED ABOUT THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN LOVE AND LIKING. YOU SAID LOVE IS COMMITTED, BUT I THOUGHT COMMITMENTS WERE ANOTHER KIND OF ATTACHMENT.”\nMy meaning of commitment and your meaning of commitment are different. Your meaning is legal, my meaning is not legal. I was simply describing to you the quality of love, what happens when you are encompassed in it: the commitment happens.\nNow my sannyasins are in a deep commitment, but that deep commitment does not create love, love creates it. Love is first, commitment follows it. If one day love disappears that commitment will also disappear; it was the shadow. When love is gone, don’t talk about commitment; then you are being foolish. It was a shadow of love. It always comes with love. And if love is no more, it goes, it disappears. You don’t go on harping on that commitment: “What about the commitment?” There is no more commitment if love is not there. Love is commitment! Love gone, all commitment is gone: this is my meaning.\nAnd I understand your meaning. Your meaning is: when love is gone, what about the commitment? That is your meaning. You want the commitment to continue when the love is gone and love is no more. Your meaning of commitment is legal.\nAlways remember: listening to me, try to follow my meaning. It is difficult, but you have to try. In that very trying you will get out of your meanings. Slowly, slowly a window will open and you will be able to see what I mean. Otherwise, there is going to be confusion: I say something, you hear something else.\nListen to this small anecdote:\nA want ad appeared in a newspaper: “WHITE MALE NEEDED TO SERVICE BABOON IN SCIENTIFIC EXPERIMENT – 1000.\nFinally, after weeks, a man answered the ad, but he made three conditions. First there was to be no foreplay, second the kids had to be raised Catholic, third it would take him a while to raise the 1000.\nWhat you understand by a certain thing depends on you. The meaning comes from your past, you supply the meaning.\nRemember it – listening to me, avoid supplying meaning to it. Try to listen to my meaning too. Don’t only listen to my words but try to find out my meaning too. Then there will be no confusion at all. Otherwise words are mine, meanings are yours – there is going to be a great confusion in your minds.\nBeing with me is a love-affair. Being with me is creating a kind of energy which I cannot create alone, by myself, and you cannot create alone, by yourself. That energy happens only when two persons are in deep love; both contribute to it. The atmosphere that is being created here cannot be created without me and cannot be created without you. You have to contribute MUCH to it. The disciple is not just there to be a passive phenomenon, he has to be actively in love. When the Master and the disciple both are active, actively moving towards each other, something of the beyond penetrates into the ordinary world.\nA Buddha alone is one thing. A Buddha with his SANGHA, with his commune, is another thing. Buddha alone is a beautiful flower but almost unrelated to existence, will sooner or later disappear, fade away and will become a myth, and people will wonder whether he ever existed or not.\nA Buddha with a commune is a very, very concrete reality – not just a flower, more rooted in the earth. The Master finds roots into the earth through the disciples. The Master belongs to the sky –\nhe can fly, he has wings, but he has no more roots. He can get roots only through you. And when a Master has roots in the earth something of immense value happens to the earth. An atmosphere, a soil is created. A new psychology is created. In that psychology many many flowers will bloom.\nLove is a miracle. It is alchemy.\nIn THE LITTLE PRINCE this small story comes up.\nHe was with the fox. “I cannot play with you,” the fox said, “I am not tamed.”\n“Oh! Please excuse me,” said the little prince. But after some thought he added, “What does that mean, ‘tame’?”\n“It is an act too often neglected,” said the fox. “It means to establish ties.” “To establish ties?”\n“Just that,” said the fox. “To me, you are still nothing more than a little boy who is just like a hundred thousand other little boys. And I have no need of you. And you, on your part, have no need of me. To you I am nothing more than a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes. But if you tame me, then we shall need each other. To me, you will be unique in all the world. To you, I shall be unique in all the world.”\n“I am beginning to understand,” said the little prince.\nBetween the Master and the disciple, the greatest tie of love happens, the greatest taming happens. If you are not a disciple, I am just one man amongst millions of men. To you, I don’t mean much. Once you are a disciple then I am unique to you, then there is nobody who can be compared to me. Once you are a disciple you are unique to me, ties are established. I start growing roots through you... the meeting of the sky and the earth. In that meeting all is possible, even the impossible is possible.\nListening to me, don’t only listen to my words. Words are needed. They are the container but not the content.

BUT THEN WHY DO
THEY TEACH SO MANY TECHNIQUES?</p><p><br></p><p>Because of the larvae, the camels.</p><p><br></p><p>The camels need many methods. They can only trust in a method, they
can only trust in technology. They are almost like machines, robots.
They cannot have the vision of the beyond, and their hearts are not
functioning yet. With the heart functioning they will become lions, and
with the soul functioning they will become the children.</p><p><br></p><p>It is like this: larvae or camels need many methods. Lions need only
one method, either love or awareness. And the child needs no method at
all. The child is already at home; he need not arrive, he need not go
anywhere.</p><p><br></p><p>The Sufis are the people on the path of love. Love has no techniques,
love is enough unto itself – but the heart has to function for it. And
the camel has no heart. And the larva has no idea of what heart is, what
feeling is, what love is. He has never dreamt about it. The larva has
never dreamt about being a caterpillar, just as the caterpillar has not
dreamt about being a butterfly.</p><p>Two caterpillars were crawling across the grass when suddenly a
butterfly flew over them. They looked up, and one nudged the other one
and said, “You could not get me up in one of those things for a million
dollars.”</p><p><br></p><p>The larva cannot trust that something is possible; nothing is
possible. The larva lives in a closed world, behind the walls. Those
walls have to be broken. Methods are needed to break those walls, to
destroy that prison. The larva has almost to be dragged outside the
prison, freedom has almost to be imposed upon it. It is afraid of
freedom, it is afraid of wings, it is afraid of the sky. It keeps its
eyes closed. It remains within itself, it does not relate, it does not
believe that relationship is possible. And the world is full of larvae
and camels.</p><p><br></p><p>Out of compassion, out of love, Sufis talk about other methods. If
you understand, then there is no need for any method. Then either there
is awareness or love. One who follows awareness needs no other method –
one is enough. One who follows love needs no awareness – one is enough.
Awareness cleanses the mind, cleanses the thought process, cleanses your
intelligence, and you arrive. Love cleanses your feelings, cleanses your
heart, and you arrive.</p><p><br></p><p>The child needs no method at all. The child does not even need love
or awareness; the child is love and awareness.</p><p><br></p><p>So it depends: if the Sufi is talking to a camel he will give
methods; if the Sufi is talking to a lion he will give him awareness or
love; and if the Sufi is talking to a child he will not say anything
about what to do. There is no need for doing. Non-doing is enough, just
being is enough.</p><p><br></p><p>The second question:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2</p><p><br></p><p>WHAT CAN A GURU DO FOR YOU?</p><p><br></p><p>The question is from Vidya’s mother, Sigrid. She must be worried
about Vidya, about what is happening to Vidya here. And, deep down, she
is nagging Vidya and trying to take back. It is natural, nothing is
wrong in it; a mother, after all, is a mother. The mother loves, cares,
and because you love and you care you become afraid also – what is
happening to your child here? Hence the question, “What can a guru do
for you?”</p><p><br></p><p>A guru can do two things: he can undo you and re-do you. He can
destroy you and give you a new life. A guru is a cross and a
resurrection.</p><p><br></p><p>Those who come here and remain outsiders will only see the cross of
the guru, because the resurrection is an inner experience. The cross is
an outside thing.</p><p><br></p><p>Have you not watched in the story of Jesus? – when he was crucified,
thousands of people witnessed it. It was simple. There was no need for
any inner insight to witness Jesus being crucified. Thousands of people,
ordinary people who had never seen Jesus, who had just come out of
curiosity, all witnessed the crucifixion. But when Jesus got resurrected
NOT EVEN HIS OWN DISCIPLES could recognize him immediately. Mary
Magdalene was the first to recognize. That is symbolic: that means you
need a feminine heart, an intuitive heart, to recognize
resurrection.</p><p>Then Jesus went to find his disciples. They had all escaped thinking,
“Now all is finished!” They waited, hiding behind the crowds. They had
waited for the moment because they were hoping that some miracle would
happen. The miracle DID happen, but to see the miracle these ordinary
eyes are not enough. These ordinary eyes can only see the UNdoing. To
see the re-doing you will need another kind of eyes. The miracle DID
happen, I say to you! – but nobody could see it because nobody was ready
to see it, nobody was mature enough to see it.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus went in search of his disciples after his resurrection. He
found two disciples; they were going to another village. He walked with
them for four miles, talked with them for four miles, and they did not
recognize him. This seems to be so improbable, but it happened. He was
walking with them, he was talking with them, and they could not see who
had come. They thought he was a stranger. In fact, Jesus remained a
stranger to these people even when he was alive. Their recognition was
superficial.</p><p><br></p><p>So those who come here just as outsiders will simply see demolishing,
will simply see undoing, will simply see that people are being
destroyed, mind-washed, hypnotized – and they will see all kinds of
things, all kinds of negative things. They will not be able to see the
positive. For the positive you will have to become part, a participant.
You will have to fall en rapport with me. You will have to come within
me and you will have to allow me within you; then you will be able to
see what a Master can do.</p><p><br></p><p>If you really want to understand it, then become a disciple! Then
come closer to a Master. And I am not saying to come closer to me, but
any Master! Go and find your Master, but come closer. Understanding one
Master, you will have understood all Masters, past, present and future,
because the work is the same. The work is to destroy the disciple so
much so that the disciple disappears as a disciple and appears as a
Master in his own right. That’s what a Master can do: he can make you a
Master.</p><p><br></p><p>The third question:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 3</p><p><br></p><p>LISTENING TO YOU, DRINKING YOU SO DEEPLY EVERY DAY, I AM GETTING
RIDICULOUSLY INTOXICATED. IF EEL READY TO QUIT MY SECURE AND MADDENING
JOB AND FACE AN UNKNOWN FUTURE. BUT I HAVE BEEN DRUNK BEFORE AND ALWAYS
WOKE UP WITH A HANGOVER AND THE SAME OLD SHIT TO DEAL WITH. IS IT
POSSIBLE I COULD WAKE UP ONE DAY AND BE LEFT WITH JUST A HANGOVER FROM
YOU?</p><p><br></p><p>Ananda Buddha, this is a totally different kind of intoxication. It
is so different that I can say to you that you are absolutely
inexperienced about it.</p><p><br></p><p>Being intoxicated with me does not make you fall asleep, so you
cannot wake up some day with a hangover. It makes you fall awake, so
there is no question of waking up sometime with a hangover. Being with
me is the awakening. What other awakening are you talking about?</p><p><br></p><p>This intoxicant drowns you only as far as the ego is concerned, but
not your consciousness. It drowns you only as far as the personality is
concerned, but not the individuality. It helps you to wake</p><p>up from the personality and to wake up in the individuality. Right
now you are asleep about your individuality and you are awake in your
personality.</p><p><br></p><p>Let us say it in this way: you have fallen asleep and you are seeing
a dream. In the dream you are awake – you are going to the market to
purchase a few things for shopping or something. In the dream you are
awake. If in the dream you fall asleep, you will be REALLY awake. But in
the dream you are awake; really you are fast asleep, you are
snoring.</p><p><br></p><p>Your awakening right now, Buddha, is not real awakening. You are in a
deep sleep, a slumber, and dreaming a thousand and one dreams. If you
allow me to hit you you will wake up for the first time. Your dreams
will disappear, your sleep will be broken, and you will come to know for
the first time who you are. Once you have tasted that awakening you
cannot fall asleep again. That taste is such – it permeates your whole
being, it pervades you, it overwhelms you, it encompasses you. This
intoxication is just to help you to fall awake.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why I have given you the name Swami Ananda Buddha: blissful
awareness, blissful awakening. You ARE asleep, and the potential is
there – you can fall awake. And the first stirrings are felt by you.</p><p><br></p><p>Take the risk! In your dream-world nothing is secure, not even your
so-called secure job. In your so-called world nothing is certain. The
dream-world cannot be certain – it is a flux, everything is changing and
moving. Today you are in a secure job, tomorrow you may not be in it.
Today you are living with a woman, tomorrow she is gone. Today you have
a beautiful child, tomorrow God has taken it back. What is secure
here?</p><p><br></p><p>Except awakening, nothing is secure here. All is just...
hallucination, all is just... deceiving yourself, creating newer and
newer mirages. The oasis exists not! This world is a desert. The oasis
exists in your awareness only. Create that oasis of awareness. And
whatsoever is needed for it, do. Whatsoever price has to be paid, pay.
Whatsoever has to be risked, risk – because all else is going to be
taken away from you anyway. Death will come, and your job and your wife
and your children and your name and fame – all will be taken away.
Before death comes search for awareness, because those who become aware
in life, for them, death never comes. They become deathless. They know
what immortality is. Because in your awareness you come to know not the
body, but the one who resides in it.</p><p><br></p><p>The fourth question:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 4</p><p><br></p><p>EVEN THOUGH I DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS HAPPENING, I HAVE HAD
ENLIGHTENING EXPERIENCES THROUGH THE USE OF HALLUCINOGENIC DRUGS. I KNOW
THAT LSD IS FALSE, BUT WHAT IS, IF ANY, THE TRUTH ABOUT MUSHROOMS?</p><p><br></p><p>The question is from Reese Guth.</p><p><br></p><p>LSD is not false, LSD is as real as anything else. But the experience
that is created by LSD is a FALSE samadhi. Remember the distinction that
I am making: LSD is not false, but the experience that is created under
the impact of LSD is a false experience.</p><p>You say, “I HAVE HAD ENLIGHTENING EXPERIENCES...”</p><p><br></p><p>They were not enlightening experiences. They may have been lightning
experiences, but not enlightening – flashes; you are not enlightened
through them, you don’t become a Buddha through them. In fact you become
more of a mess out of them. The LSD changes your body chemistry, as
mushrooms do. It changes your body chemistry. It does not change you, it
changes your body – just as food changes your body, air changes your
body, climate changes your body, the moon, the full moon changes your
body, but you are not being changed by it. All those changes happen in
the body, all those changes are chemical changes – not alchemical but
only chemical. What is an alchemical change? – when your consciousness
changes. And the consciousness cannot be changed by ANYTHING that comes
from the outside.</p><p><br></p><p>The consciousness cannot be changed by food, eating this food or
that. The consciousness cannot be changed by non-eating, by fasting.
Remember, there is not much difference between people who take LSD and
the people who go on a long fast, no difference! Both are trying to
change the body chemistry. The people who take mushrooms and other drugs
are not doing anything different from the people who do yoga exercises,
because in both ways the BODY is changed. The change is not happening in
consciousness. Consciousness REMAINS BEYOND all chemicals.</p><p><br></p><p>If you fast long enough, naturally your body chemistry can’t be the
same. A few things disappear from your body chemistry and a few things
accumulate too much. Your body has a different combination of
chemicals.</p><p><br></p><p>After a one month long fast you will feel beautiful things, but those
beautiful things are created by the chemical change. Start eating and
those beautiful things will disappear. You do certain yoga postures
continuously, for years, pressing your body structure at certain points,
certain important points, pressing your body meridians at certain
junctures continuously; it changes your body chemistry. Breathe in a
certain way for years, always in a certain way – it changes your body
chemistry, because the oxygen and the carbon dioxide balance will be
changed by your breathing.</p><p><br></p><p>Have you not noticed it? – when you are angry you breathe in a
different way? Why? That different way of breathing releases some
chemicals in your body which are helpful to being angry. If you don’t
breathe in a different way you will not be able to be angry. Try it:
breathe in the Buddhist way and you will not be able to go into anger,
because the Buddhist way won’t allow your body chemicals to be released
which are needed for the anger.</p><p><br></p><p>You are afraid? You breathe in a different way. Different chemicals
are needed, because a man who is frightened needs to escape fast, as
fast as possible. He needs flight, certain chemicals are needed so he
can flee fast. When you are in sexual passion your breathing changes.
Continue to breathe normally and you will not be able to achieve orgasm.
For the orgasm to be triggered a certain kind of breathing is
needed.</p><p><br></p><p>But these changes are physical; these are not going to affect your
consciousness. The consciousness is the witness to all changes. Just try
to understand.</p><p><br></p><p>You are hungry, feeling hungry: the body is hungry, the consciousness
simply notes the fact that the body is hungry. The consciousness is
never hungry, cannot be hungry; it has no stomach. It can only</p><p>be a witness. Consciousness is nothing but witnessing. Remember this
formula: consciousness is witnessing. You are hungry? The consciousness
reflects the hunger. It is like a mirror: it says “The body is hungry.”
When you have eaten and your body is satisfied, the consciousness says
“The body is satisfied.” The consciousness was not hungry and is not
satisfied either. In both cases the consciousness was just witnessing –
hunger/satisfaction, sexual passion/sexual contentment, anger/release of
anger.</p><p><br></p><p>You take LSD or some other drug, and there are lightning experiences.
Consciousness is simply waiting and watching. It simply says, “Look,
beautiful things are happening,” but they are not happening to
consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>The spiritual growth is the growth of this witnessing! The spiritual
growth has nothing to do with particular experiences. The spiritual
growth is not a search for novel experiences. Spirituality has nothing
to do with experiences as such. In fact to say any experience is
‘spiritual experience’ is utterly wrong, because all experiences are
non-spiritual. THE EXPERIENCER IS THE SPIRIT. The witness is the only
spiritual phenomenon. When all experiences have disappeared – of hunger,
of satiety, of anger, of release, of love, of hate, of kundalini arising
in you, chakras opening in you, lotuses opening in you, lights showering
in you; celestial music is heard, you feel great space, you feel joy,
you feel bliss, but these are all experiences – the real spiritual point
is when there is NO experience, and the experiencer is left alone,
utterly alone. There is no object to experience, but only this witness
is there, silently witnessing nothing. Then you have arrived. This is
SAMADHI. Witnessing nothing is SAMADHI. That’s why Buddha calls it
NIRVANA, nothingness, emptiness.</p><p><br></p><p>Your question is meaningful. And the question is not only concerned
with psychedelic experiences, it is concerned with all kinds of
experiences. Experiences AS SUCH are non-spiritual. When all experiences
have gone and you don’t feel ANYTHING AT ALL, and you have not fallen
asleep either<span class=s4></span>In sleep also those experiences
disappear. In deep sleep, what Patanjali calls SUSHUPTI,</p><p>where dreams are no more, all experiences disappear, but the
experiencer is also absent. Patanjali says SUSHUPTI and SAMADHI are
similar and yet very different, diametrically opposite. What is their
similarity? The similarity is that in both, experiences are not found.
And what is their difference? In SUSHUPTI, in deep sleep, the
experiencer is also not found. In SAMADHI experiences are gone but the
experiencer is sitting there silently watching nothing, witnessing
nothing. This is enlightenment! Experiences can be lightning
experiences, can be beautiful experiences, can give you great joy, but
still they are not enlightenment.</p><p><br></p><p>Enlightenment is when the light is there and it falls on nothing. The
light fills nothingness, no object is seen in that light – this is
liberation. To be liberated from experiences is to be liberated from the
world. ‘The world’ means ALL kinds of experiences, what the Chinese call
‘the ten thousand experiences’ – that’s what the world consists of.</p><p><br></p><p>You say, “EVEN THOUGH I DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS HAPPENING, I HAVE
HAD ENLIGHTENING EXPERIENCES THROUGH THE USE OF HALLUCINOGENIC DRUGS. I
KNOW THAT LSD IS FALSE BUT WHAT IS, IF ANY, THE TRUTH ABOUT
MUSHROOMS?”</p><p><br></p><p>The truth is they can give you beautiful trips, and ugly trips too.
They can give you golden dreams, and nightmares too. It all depends on
you.</p><p>The drug only triggers a process. Whatsoever dream is ready to
explode in you will be exploded, hence contradictory experiences have
been reported.</p><p><br></p><p>Aldous Huxley reports that he experienced heaven, and Karl Rahner
reports he experienced hell. Now Karl Rahner is against drugs and Aldous
Huxley is all for the drugs. If you are all for the drugs your very
prejudice will help you to create beautiful experiences. You will be
waiting and hoping for something beautiful to happen, your belief will
do the magic. If you are against from the very beginning, suspicious,
doubtful, afraid, and you know that you are going to have some hellish
experience through it, it will be created.</p><p><br></p><p>An ancient Sufi saying says: Hell is preserved for those who believe
in it. And heaven is also preserved for those who believe in it. But
it’s all just make-believe. There is no hell, no heaven; you create your
hell, you create your heaven. If you are in a kind of negative mood then
take LSD and it will give you nightmares. If you are in a positive mood,
flowing, loving, it will take you to paradise.</p><p><br></p><p>The ancient-most drug takers have been in India. India knows more
about drugs than any other country. At least for ten thousand years
ninety-nine percent of Indian sannyasins have been taking drugs, from
the RIG-VEDAS till today, from SOMA to LSD. India knows much, India has
created technologies, techniques, methodologies of how to take a drug.
The drug trip should be a very guided trip; it needs a guide. The guide
creates the atmosphere, he creates the idea. Slowly, slowly he goes on
hypnotizing you about what is happening. And in a drug state a person
becomes very suggestible, absolutely suggestible; all reason is lost.
The dream faculty starts functioning, imagination is let loose. Now,
imagination can do both – either it can create hell or heaven. You need
a guide. The guide slowly, slowly guides you towards heaven, heavenly
experiences. He creates a beautiful dream, a poetic dream around you;
and you are in a suggestible state, you simply fall a victim.</p><p><br></p><p>But guided or unguided, a drug experience or a fasting experience –
all are false. EXPERIENCE IS FALSE.</p><p><br></p><p>SAMADHI is when the witness has remained alone, witnessing nothing.
That is the TRUE spiritual experience, if you will allow me to call it
experience. It is not experience, because in experience you need three
things: the experiencer, the experienced and the experience. There are
not three things left at all. There is only one witness, witnessing
utter nothingness, SHUNYA, emptiness. That is true experience.</p><p><br></p><p>The true experience is a ‘no-experience’. And when you attain to a
no-experience, only then believe that it is enlightening. Otherwise
lightning experiences will come and go, flashes of the mind, dream-
stuff.</p><p><br></p><p>The fifth question:</p><p><br></p><p>IS TO BE A SANNYASIN A MOMENT OR A PROCESS? IS A GURU REALLY NEEDED
TO BE a SANNYASIN? IF A GURU LIVES IN SOMEBODY’S HEART ALL THE TIME,
THEN WHAT IS THE NECESSITY OF WEARING ORANGE AND THE MALA ALL THE TIME?
WAS EKLAVYA NOT A REAL DISCIPLE?</p><p>The question is from Kartik. The question is from some Indian mind,
some Indian. Many things have to be understood.</p><p><br></p><p>First you ask, “IS TO BE A SANNYASIN A MOMENT OR A PROCESS?”</p><p><br></p><p>It is both, because it is a beginning of a great pilgrimage – so it
is an event, a moment, and also a process. By becoming a sannyasin you
have not arrived, you have only started arriving. It is a great moment
because it is a quantum leap from your ordinary mundane world, from the
search for power, prestige. You have moved to seek and search for truth.
From moving outwards, into the world, you have taken a decision to move
inwards. From the external your being is turning towards the internal.
It is a great moment, because interiority is born in it! It is a great
change in your pattern of life, in your style of life: you will never be
the same again. It is a drastic change, it is a discontinuity – the past
is dropped and you start creating yourself anew – but it is also a
process because this is just a beginning. You have started moving
inwards, but you will have to go on moving.</p><p><br></p><p>Lao Tzu says, “The journey of ten thousand miles starts in the first
step.” The first step is a great moment. Just thing: the larva becomes
the caterpillar... a great moment, because the larva was static, and the
caterpillar moves, crawls. The caterpillar is not yet a butterfly. It
knows nothing of flying, it knows nothing of flowers, it is not yet a
winged thing, but the journey has started. The journey of ten thousand
miles – the first step has been taken. it has started crawling. If
crawling is possible, then one day flying will also be possible.</p><p><br></p><p>The larva cannot become the butterfly, only the caterpillar can
become the butterfly. The worldly man cannot arrive in his being, only a
sannyasin can arrive. The sannyasin is between the larva and the
butterfly, the link.</p><p><br></p><p>So a sannyasin is both the beginning of a journey and a process; it
is a moment and a process. You ask, “IS A GURU REALLY NEEDED TO BE A
SANNYASIN?”</p><p>You need me even to ask this question! You can’t answer it yourself.
How are you going to answer greater questions? – because this is a very
silly and stupid question, not of any worth. If I am answering it, it is
just to respect you, to respect a camel.</p><p><br></p><p>If you cannot answer a silly, ordinary question like this yourself,
how are you going to become a sannyasin on your own?</p><p><br></p><p>The caterpillar will need a butterfly. Seeing the butterfly flying
around, enjoying flowers and the honey and enjoying the sunshine will be
needed, is a must. That will create a desire, a longing, a thirst in the
caterpillar. It will create a dream, a dream which can become a reality.
Unless the caterpillar starts dreaming, there is no possibility. How
will you start dreaming about unknown things? You have not known them!
You can dream only about that which you have known. You can think about
a thing which you have experienced in the past: how will you think about
God, about truth, about NIRVANA, about SAMADHI? These are empty words
for you, utterly empty of any meaning, meaningless jargon. You will have
to come in contact with a person in whom SAMADHI IS alive, throbbing,
beating, breathing. You will have to come in close contact with a person
in whom truth is born, in whom you can have a glimpse of God; that’s all
that is needed. You will have to</p><p>come in contact with someone where the disease called God can become
infectious. You will have to move with a drunkard. Seeing his joy,
seeing his blissfulness and his silence and his calm and his cool, you
may become thirsty, thirsty for something you have never tasted
before.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what a Master is all about. If you can do it on your own, it
is so kind of you. Do it. Read American books, ‘do it’ books – do it
yourself. But you will create more mess than you are in already. Out of
your confusion, whatsoever you will do, more confusion will come.</p><p><br></p><p>You are already a crowd, falling apart. You cannot put yourself
together. And I am not saying that it does not happen sometimes; it
happens sometimes: there have been people who have put themselves
together. But those people are exceptional, and they don’t come here to
ask questions like this.</p><p><br></p><p>Once a young man came to me and asked, “What do you say, Osho, about
marriage? Should I get married or not? I am a seeker, a searcher for
truth.” I told him, “You please get married.” But he said, “But this is
very unexpected! Why didn’t you get married? I have come to you because
I knew you would say, ‘No, don’t get married.’ Why didn’t you get
married?” I said, “Because I never went to ask anybody, that has not
been my way. I have never asked any question of anybody.”</p><p><br></p><p>You are tricky. You want to have the answer, you want guidance, and
yet you don’t want to commit yourself. You want all guidance
cheaply.</p><p><br></p><p>I have never asked a single question of anybody. That’s why when I
was in the university my professors were very angry with me – because I
was always answering them, not questioning. Very angry, naturally! If
you answer a professor he becomes angry. I was turned out from many
colleges, expelled, and the only crime that I had committed was that I
was answering. Even if I was asking, the question was such that it was
really an answer, not a question. The professors were angry. They wanted
questions so that they could answer, because answers they knew.</p><p><br></p><p>If you are searching for truth, if you have moved into the search,
you will need a Master. And remember, I repeat again: it is not that it
cannot happen alone. It has happened to me alone, so how can I say that
it cannot happen alone? Lao Tzu says, “You need not go out of your
house, you need not even open your windows and doors, and all can be
found there sitting inside your room.” And he is right, but it happens
very rarely.</p><p><br></p><p>You are being cunning: you want the guidance, and you don’t want to
bow down to a Master.</p><p><br></p><p>You ask me, “IF A GURU LIVES IN SOMEBODY’S HEART ALL THE TIME,, THEN
WHAT IS THE NECESSITY OF WEARING ORANGE AND THE MALA ALL THE TIME?”</p><p><br></p><p>Then there is no necessity. Then there is no necessity even to ask
this question! If a guru lives for twenty-four hours in your heart, you
have become a Buddha Even to remember your guru for twenty-four seconds
continuously is impossible. What are you talking about? – twenty-four
hours?</p><p><br></p><p>Try to remember me for twenty-four seconds. Just keep a wristwatch in
front of you and try to remember me for twenty-four seconds, and
twenty-four thousand times you will miss. A second will pass and you
will start thinking of your girlfriend, or what movie to go to today.
And then you will</p><p>have to pull back. Again you will remember, “What am I doing? – five
seconds have passed. And for one second you may be able just to
remember, so-so, lukewarm, and again it is lost. Just try for
twenty-four seconds. If you can remember me continuously for twenty-four
seconds, without a single distraction, you need not have any orange, any
mala I declare you a sannyasin.</p><p><br></p><p>And you are saying ‘for twenty-four hours’ “If a guru LIVES IN
SOMEBODY’S HEART ALL THE TIME, THEN WHAT IS THE NECESSITY OF WEARING
ORANGE AND THE MALA ALL THE TIME?”</p><p><br></p><p>But if the guru that lives in your heart says “Wear orange”, what
will you do then? Will you listen to the guru or not? What do you think
about the people who are wearing orange here? Are they very willingly
wearing orange? But the guru says so! What to do? And they have fallen
in love with the guru Now the guru is mad and he says, “Wear orange!”
The guru is eccentric. First you fall in love with the guru, and then
the guru starts playing tricks on you. He says, “Wear orange, wear a
mala, and look like a fool! And go into the world and let people
laugh!”</p><p><br></p><p>But if the guru lives for twenty-four hours in your heart, you will
be ready to commit suicide if he says to!</p><p><br></p><p>And then you ask, “WAS EKLAVYA NOT A REAL DISCIPLE?”</p><p><br></p><p>I will have to tell you the story first; only then will you be able
to understand it.</p><p><br></p><p>You know of the Bhagavad-Gita, of Krishna the Master and his disciple
Arjuna. When Arjuna was learning with Drona.<span class=s4></span>In
his student days, he was with a master archer, Drona. He was the
greatest</p><p>master archer in those days. Arjuna belonged to a royal family, so
all the children from the royal family were learning with Drona, and
Arjuna was the best disciple.</p><p><br></p><p>Drona was a brahmin. Eklavya came; Eklavya was an untouchable, and
Eklavya wanted to become a disciple also. Drona refused. A brahmin? How
can he accept an untouchable, a sudra? That has been one of the greatest
pathologies of the Hindu mind. The Hindu mind has been ill and unhealthy
because of that. Notwithstanding so many great things that they have
done, that one thing has undone all their great things. They have
condemned human beings so utterly that never before, anywhere in the
world, have human beings been condemned so badly. And that is done by
so- called religious people who claim that they are the greatest
religious people of the world. And they have been doing something which
is so ugly – millions of people have been debarred from being human
beings. Eklavya belonged to those downtrodden, oppressed people. But he
had a beautiful body, and Drona could see – because he was a great
teacher – he could see that he could become one of the most famous
archers in the world. He could see directly: the way he walked, the way
he talked, his one-pointed mind, his concentrated being – Drona could
see that this young man could become the best archer of that age. “But
then what will happen to my disciple, Arjuna? And he’s going to be the
king”.<span class=s4></span>now, the vested interest. He refused. He
refused for two reasons: one. “You</p><p>are a sudra and I am a brahmin; I cannot accept you. Even the shadow
of a sudra is unacceptable.” Brahmins have been taking baths if the
shadow of a sudra would fall on them. The shadow! He need not have
touched anyone. And these are spiritual people! And the shadow is
non-existential. If you are sitting and a sudra passes by and his shadow
touches you, you have to take a a bath. You have been polluted by his
being.</p><p>And these sudras are not sinners. They are simply poor people,
exploited people, the proletariat.</p><p><br></p><p>“First, you are a sudra so I cannot accept,” said Drona. In saying
that, he also said that he was not a spiritual man at all. He may have
been a great master archer, but he was not a spiritual Master, he was
not a guru. In denying Eklavya, he proved that he was not a guru,
because a guru cannot deny anybody. Even if a sinner comes, the guru
cannot deny. That is what he exists for.</p><p><br></p><p>Sometimes people come to me and they say, “We are not worthy. We are
sinners. We have done this wrong and that. Osho, will you accept us?”
And I say, “For whom do I exist here?” If the doctor says to the
patient, “I cannot accept you because you have so many illnesses,” then
what is the point of that doctor? Why is he there if he accepts only
healthy men?</p><p><br></p><p>Drona was not a guru, not a spiritual Master. He must have been a
very ugly politician. It was on the surface that he said, “I cannot
accept because you are a sudra”, but deep down this was the reasoning:
that if this Eklavya were accepted and he became a great archer, what
would happen to his favorite disciple? “And the favorite disciple is
going to become the king, not Eklavya. With the favorite disciple my
whole future is involved. If Arjuna becomes the king then I will be the
master of the king, and naturally powerful, even more powerful than the
king. The king will touch my feet, and my order will be THE order.” He
wanted Arjuna to remain the greatest archer; Eklavya was denied.</p><p><br></p><p>Eklavya went into the forest, but his love for archery was such that
he created a statue of Drona and started practicing before the statue.
Soon rumors started coming to Drona’s school that Eklavya was
attaining... alone, without any guidance from Drona. But his totality
was such that even the statue was enough.</p><p><br></p><p>And one day the news came that Arjuna was no longer a competent
archer before Eklavya. Drona went to see Eklavya, and he committed one
thing which can never be forgiven. He went there and he asked Eklavya to
show him, and he saw, and it was absolutely certain that Arjuna was no
longer a comparison to Eklavya. Eklavya had far transcended Arjuna and
all his disciples; in fact, had far transcended Drona himself. Now he
said, “You have learned through me by making my statue. You will have to
give me some present, DAKSHINA.” When a disciple has learned all from
the Master, just in gratitude he gives some gift to the Master, any
symbolic gift. Eklavya started crying and weeping. He said, “But I have
nothing! You can ask anything!” And Drona asked for his thumb, his
right-hand thumb. He cut off his thumb immediately and gave it to Drona.
He asked the right-hand thumb because without it he would never be an
archer again.</p><p><br></p><p>Now this fellow, Drona, is an ugly spot on Hindu consciousness. He
was not a spiritual Master at all. He was a very, very low politician, a
diplomat. He may have been a good archer but that doesn’t make anybody
spiritual. First he had denied Eklavya, and now he went... what
CHUTZPAH! now he went and asked that something be given to him as a
gift: “I am your Master.” He had denied his being a disciple, and now he
went and said that “I am your Master.”</p><p><br></p><p>Eklavya is really rare. Such a great soul; Drona is not even worthy
enough to touch his feet. He didn’t say anything. He could have
said,“You have denied me”, but he didn’t say that. That idea never arose
in his mind. He had trusted him as the Master even if he had been
denied. He had loved him and he was ready to give anything. He gave his
right-hand thumb, became a cripple forever and was no longer heard of.
Since that moment nothing is known about Eklavya, about what happened.
He</p><p>must have gone to the forest, must have lived in his tribe, sweeping
streets. He must have forgotten all about archery – a great archer
destroyed.</p><p><br></p><p>Now this is the story.</p><p><br></p><p>Kartik has asked, “WAS EKLAVYA NOT A REAL DISCIPLE?”</p><p><br></p><p>Eklavya was a real disciple, Drona was not a real guru.</p><p><br></p><p>But you should not ask this question, because you simply want to
avoid the mala and orange. And Eklavya, even if denied by the Master,
although rejected by the Master, went into the forest and created an
image of the Master. You should not bring Eklavya’s name into it. You
are just the opposite!</p><p><br></p><p>What is the mala? – an image.</p><p><br></p><p>There the Master had denied, here the Master is ready to accept you.
Even though denied by the Master, Eklavya created an image of the Master
and through that image attained. You should not bring Eklavya in with
your question. It is contradictory, it contradicts you. It does not
prove that you are right, it simply proves you are UTTERLY wrong. Even a
man like Eklavya could not do without the image! It was needed, it
helped, it created a certain milieu, it created an atmosphere, a
climate. And if love is total then the mala is not dead. Then it is not
wood, it is your heart. Then the image in the mala is not just a
picture. It depends on your love: how much love you pour into it, that
much life it will have. And it is needed. It creates a climate around
you, and only in a certain climate will you be able to bloom.</p><p><br></p><p>The sixth question:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 5</p><p><br></p><p>AS ONE EVOLVES SPIRITUALLY, INTEREST IN SEX MAY BECOME LESS STRONG.
SO IF I’M NOT SO SEXY THESE DAYS AM I GETTING OLDER OR CLOSER TO
ENLIGHTENMENT?</p><p><br></p><p>There is a criterion to judge it: if your sexuality disappears and
you become more loving, then it is not just old age. If with sexuality
your loving quality also disappears, then it is old age.</p><p><br></p><p>Have you not observed it? – old people become unloving, nagging,
always angry, rude, oppressing, always finding excuses to torture,
condemn. What happens? The moment one becomes less sexual, juices start
drying up. Once the magic of desire fades, people become desert-like.
All their greenness is of their sexuality and sensuality. All their
flowering is that of:sex and nothing else. So once sex becomes less and
less important, their greenery starts disappearing. They become
non-communicative, they are always angry, and they are very much in
their egos.</p><p><br></p><p>Nobody likes older people, even their own children. The reason is not
old age, the reason is: once the magic of desire is gone they become
rock-like. And once their own desire is gone, they become very jealous
of others’ desires. An old person cannot tolerate you being in love.
He’s always there with condemning eyes, because he says he knows it is
all nonsense, because he says “I have lived it and I know it is all
futile.” This happens to old people, this happens to old countries
too.</p><p>If in Poona you find that you are condemned if you are moving hand in
hand with your woman and people look with condemning eyes, that is just
because the country has gone stale and old. It is a very old country,
its magic of desire has died. It has no magic. It is dominated by the
old people, it is non-accepting of the young. The old cannot accept the
youth and the joy of youth – it hurts.</p><p><br></p><p>So this is the criterion: if you are simply becoming old you will not
only become non-sexual, you will become dry, dull, dead, and you will
start condemning other people who are still young. That’s a kind of
revenge. Deep down it is jealousy: “How come my own desire is gone and
people are still desiring? I am dying and you are loving? Death is
coming closer every moment and you are still searching for a woman or a
man, still singing and dancing?” It is unacceptable to the old
people.</p><p><br></p><p>But if old age is not just aging but wisdom too, then there will be a
totally different thing. The older person will feel very, very happy
with people loving each other. He will have a blessing, a benediction
always flowing through him. Whenever he will see somebody in love, his
eyes will have a joy. He will bless them, because he knows each desire
has its own time, and one learns only through experience. Yes, now he is
disillusioned, and he knows perfectly well that when he was young his
father was also disillusioned but he never listened. Now he knows, “My
son is also not going to listen. And it is good that he should not
listen, because if he listens he will never be able to live his youth.”
And youth unlived penetrates old age. And when youth penetrates old age,
the old age becomes dirty, ugly; it is impotent. Now you cannot live
those experiences but they go on hammering inside your mind. They go on
coming as dreams, desires. The body is no longer able to go into them
but the mind continues. Sex becomes cerebral. And that is the most
perverted state of sex, when it becomes cerebral. It should be genital,
not cerebral – but the sexual mechanism is no longer functioning and the
whole energy has moved into the head.</p><p>If a man has lived his childhood perfectly he will come out of it a
grown-up man. If a man has lived his youth perfectly he will come out of
it a grown-up old man – wise, happy, silent, calm, quiet, loving. With
the disappearance of sex, love will not disappear. In fact, love will
become more, because the energy that was involved in sex is no longer
involved in sex; all that energy has become available for love. An old
man can be as loving as NO young man can ever be, because the young have
other interests.</p><p><br></p><p>Love is really secondary for a young man; his whole interest is sex.
When a young man is telling a girl, “I love you”, he’s just planning how
to hop into the bed. All this is nonsense, he knows, but it has to be
done, it is part of the game. If you ask a woman suddenly, “How about
it?” she may scream or call the police; it is so unexpected. You have to
persuade. And she is also thinking – if you go on persuading long
enough, she becomes bored. If you go on saying, “I love you, I love
you,” and there is no sign of hopping into the bed, she becomes fed-up.
The introduction should not be too long. It should not be like George
Bernard Shaw where the book consists of only a hundred pages and the
introduction is two hundred pages. Who waits for the book then? An
introduction is an introduction; it makes things easy.</p><p>The young man’s interest is sex, is not love. Love is an excuse, love
is politeness, love is culture, sophistication, but his real interest is
sex. Love is like sugar that we coat on bitter pills – that’s how the
young man is interested. His real love is sex.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not incidental that the young people all over the world have
started calling sex ‘making love’. That’s what their love is. Depth they
cannot know. The young man is bound to remain shallow.</p><p>Sex is shallow, so a young man is shallow. Youth cannot have depth,
and youth cannot have calm understanding. Youth is feverish, it is a
tumultuous time. Good! I’m not saying it is wrong: it creates the
possibility to grow. You have to pass through many experiences, sweet
and bitter. You have to pass through many stages of feverishness, of
ecstasy, of excitement; only then a moment comes when you start
understanding. Those experiences prepare you, they cleanse you. You have
to pass through the fire of youth to become the pure gold of old age. A
really old man is wise, he has some light in him. He has lived his life,
he has become ripe. He knows what life is: he knows its joys, its
sorrows, its ups and downs, he knows its hells and its heavens. He has
seen all. Seeing all, a great understanding has arisen in him, and a
compassion and a love.</p><p><br></p><p>So this has to be the criterion: if with the disappearance of sex, at
the same time, simultaneously, comes the appearance of love, compassion
and understanding, then it is not just that you are growing old. You are
Coming closer to enlightenment. But if it is not so, then you are simply
growing old. Growing old is not a great qualification – everybody does
it in his own time, it happens – but growing in wisdom is a
qualification, certainly a qualification.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard.…</p><p><br></p><p>A most attractive young girl was being interviewed by St. Peter at
the Pearly Gates.</p><p><br></p><p>“While you were on earth,” he asked, “did you indulge in promiscuity,
smoking, dancing, or any other forms of wickedness?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Never, never!” protested the girl.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, then why have you not reported sooner?” asked St. Peter. “You
have been dead for years!” Remember, don’t die before your death! Remain
alive.</p><p>I have also heard...</p><p><br></p><p>An anthropologist in Java came across a little-known tribe with a
strange funeral rite. When a man died, they buried him for sixty days
and then dug him up. He was placed in a dark room on a cool slab, and
twenty of the tribe’s most beautiful maidens danced erotic dances
entirely in the nude around the corpse for three hours.</p><p><br></p><p>“Why do you do this?” the anthropologist asked the chief of the
tribe, who replied, “If he does not get up we are sure he is dead.”</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t think that by becoming more and more dead you will be coming
closer to enlightenment. Enlightenment is not a quality of death, it is
a quality of RIPE LIFE, it is a quality of rich life. One who has lived
his life in many, many ways, good and bad, as the sinner and the saint,
one who has the experience of the varieties, of all possibilities,
becomes ripe; and in that ripeness is richness, is glory.</p><p><br></p><p>Let this be the criterion, always judge through this criterion: if
love is growing, compassion is coming, understanding is growing, then
you are on the right track. If with your sexuality love is dying,
understanding is dying, compassion dying, then you are on the wrong
track.</p><p>The last question:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 6</p><p><br></p><p>YOU REALLY CONFUSED ME WHEN YOU TALKED ABOUT THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN
LOVE AND LIKING. YOU SAID LOVE IS COMMITTED, BUT I THOUGHT COMMITMENT
WAS ANOTHER KIND OF ATTACHMENT. THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE I LOVE BUT I DON’T
FEEL COMMITTED TO. HOW CAN I PREDICT IF I WILL LOVE THEM TOMORROW?</p><p><br></p><p>The question is significant. You will have to be very, very
understanding, because it is subtle and complex too.</p><p><br></p><p>When I said that love is commitment, what do I mean by it? I don’t
mean that you have to promise for tomorrow, but the promise is there.
You don’t have to promise, but the promise is there. This is the
complexity and the subtleness of it. You don’t say, “I will love you
tomorrow too”, but in the moment of love that promise is there, utterly
present. It needs no expression.</p><p><br></p><p>When you love a person you CAN’T think otherwise. You CAN’T think
that you will not love this person some day; that is impossible, that is
not part of love. And I am not saying that you may not be able to get
out of this love-affair; you may be, you may not be. That is not the
point. But when you are in the love moment, when the energy is flowing
between two persons, there is a bridge, a golden bridge, and they are
bridged through it. It simply does not happen: the mind cannot conceive
and comprehend that there will be a time when you will not be with this
person and this person will not be with you. This is commitment. Not
that you say so much, not that you go to a court and make a formal
statement: “I will remain forever with you.” In fact to make that formal
statement simply shows there is no love; you need a legal arrangement.
If the commitment is there, there is no need for any legal
arrangement.</p><p><br></p><p>Marriage is needed because love is missing. If love is there
profoundly, marriage will not be needed. What is the point of marriage?
– that is like putting legs on a snake, or painting a red rose red. It
is unnecessary. Why go to the court? There must be some fear inside
you... the love is not total.</p><p><br></p><p>Even while in deep love you are thinking of the possibility that
tomorrow you may desert this woman. The woman is thinking, “Who knows?
Tomorrow this man may desert me. It is better to go to the court. First
let it become legal, then one can depend.” But what does it show? – it
simply shows that love is not total. Otherwise, total love has that
quality of commitment on its own accord. It has not to be brought to it,
it is its intrinsic quality.</p><p><br></p><p>And when you are in love it comes naturally to you, not that you
plan. This feeling comes naturally and sometimes in words too: “I will
love you forever.” This is THIS moment’s depth. It doesn’t say anything
about tomorrow, remember. It is not a promise. It is just that the depth
and the totality of love is such that it comes automatically to you to
say, “I will love you forever and ever. Even death will not be able to
part us.” This is the feeling of total love.</p><p><br></p><p>And let me repeat again – that does not mean that tomorrow you will
be together. Who knows? That is not the point at all. Tomorrow will take
care of itself. Tomorrow never enters into the mind which is in love.
Tomorrow is not conceived at all, future disappears, this moment becomes
eternity. This is commitment.</p><p>And when tomorrow... it is possible you may not be together, but you
are not betraying. You are not deceiving, You are not cheating. You will
feel sad about it, you will feel sorry about it, but you have to depart.
And I’m not saying that it has to happen; it may not happen. It depends
on a thousand and one things.</p><p><br></p><p>Life does not depend only on your love. If it were to depend only on
your love then you would live for ever and ever. But life depends on a
thousand and one things. Love has the feeling that “We will live
together forever”, but love is not the whole of life. When it is there
it is so intense, one is drunk with it. But then there are a thousand
and one things, sometimes small things.</p><p><br></p><p>You may fall in love with a man, and in that moment you are ready to
go to hell with him, and you can say so, and you are not cheating. You
are utterly true and honest and you say, “If I have to go to hell with
you I will go!” – and I say again, you are true, you are not saying
anything false. But tomorrow, living with that man, small things – a
dirty bathroom may disturb your affair. Hell is too far away, there is
no need to go that far – a dirty bathroom! Or just a small habit: the
man snores in the night and drives you crazy! And you were ready to go
to hell, and that was true. It was authentic in that moment, it was not
false, you had no other idea – but the man snores in the night; or his
perspiration smells like hell, or he has bad breath and when he kisses
you, you feel you are tortured. Just small things, very small things;
one never thinks of them when one is in love. Who bothers about a
bathroom, and who thinks about snoring? But when you live together with
a person, a thousand and one things are involved, and any small thing
can become a rock and can destroy the flower of love.</p><p><br></p><p>So I’m not saying that the commitment has any promise in it. I’m
simply saying that the moment of love is a moment of commitment. You are
utterly in it, it is so decisive. And naturally, out of this moment will
come the next, so there is every possibility that you may be together.
Out of today tomorrow will be born. It will not be coming from the blue,
it will grow out of today. If today has been of great love, tomorrow
will also carry the same love. It will be a continuity. So there is
every possibility that you may love, but it is always a perhaps. And
love understands that.</p><p><br></p><p>And if one day you leave your woman or your woman leaves you, you
will not start shouting at her, “What do you mean now? You had told me
one day that ‘I will live always and always with you.’ Now what? Why are
you going?” If you loved, if you had known love, you will understand.
Love has that quality of commitment.</p><p><br></p><p>Love is a mystery. When it is there, everything looks heavenly. When
it is gone, everything looks simply stale, meaningless. You could not
have lived without this woman, and now you cannot live with this woman.
And both are authentic states.</p><p><br></p><p>You ask, “YOU REALLY CONFUSED ME WHEN YOU TALKED ABOUT THE
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN LOVE AND LIKING. YOU SAID LOVE IS COMMITTED, BUT I
THOUGHT COMMITMENTS WERE ANOTHER KIND OF ATTACHMENT.”</p><p><br></p><p>My meaning of commitment and your meaning of commitment are
different. Your meaning is legal, my meaning is not legal. I was simply
describing to you the quality of love, what happens when you are
encompassed in it: the commitment happens.</p><p>Now my sannyasins are in a deep commitment, but that deep commitment
does not create love, love creates it. Love is first, commitment follows
it. If one day love disappears that commitment will also disappear; it
was the shadow. When love is gone, don’t talk about commitment; then you
are being foolish. It was a shadow of love. It always comes with love.
And if love is no more, it goes, it disappears. You don’t go on harping
on that commitment: “What about the commitment?” There is no more
commitment if love is not there. Love is commitment! Love gone, all
commitment is gone: this is my meaning.</p><p><br></p><p>And I understand your meaning. Your meaning is: when love is gone,
what about the commitment? That is your meaning. You want the commitment
to continue when the love is gone and love is no more. Your meaning of
commitment is legal.</p><p><br></p><p>Always remember: listening to me, try to follow my meaning. It is
difficult, but you have to try. In that very trying you will get out of
your meanings. Slowly, slowly a window will open and you will be able to
see what I mean. Otherwise, there is going to be confusion: I say
something, you hear something else.</p><p><br></p><p>Listen to this small anecdote:</p><p><br></p><p>A want ad appeared in a newspaper: “WHITE MALE NEEDED TO SERVICE
BABOON IN SCIENTIFIC EXPERIMENT – <span class=s5>1000</span><span class=s6>.</span></p><p><br></p><p>Finally, after weeks, a man answered the ad, but he made three
conditions. First there was to be no foreplay, second the kids had to be
raised Catholic, third it would take him a while to raise the <span class=s5>1000</span><span class=s6>.</span></p><p><br></p><p>What you understand by a certain thing depends on you. The meaning
comes from your past, you supply the meaning.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember it – listening to me, avoid supplying meaning to it. Try to
listen to my meaning too. Don’t only listen to my words but try to find
out my meaning too. Then there will be no confusion at all. Otherwise
words are mine, meanings are yours – there is going to be a great
confusion in your minds.</p><p><br></p><p>Being with me is a love-affair. Being with me is creating a kind of
energy which I cannot create alone, by myself, and you cannot create
alone, by yourself. That energy happens only when two persons are in
deep love; both contribute to it. The atmosphere that is being created
here cannot be created without me and cannot be created without you. You
have to contribute MUCH to it. The disciple is not just there to be a
passive phenomenon, he has to be actively in love. When the Master and
the disciple both are active, actively moving towards each other,
something of the beyond penetrates into the ordinary world.</p><p><br></p><p>A Buddha alone is one thing. A Buddha with his SANGHA, with his
commune, is another thing. Buddha alone is a beautiful flower but almost
unrelated to existence, will sooner or later disappear, fade away and
will become a myth, and people will wonder whether he ever existed or
not.</p><p><br></p><p>A Buddha with a commune is a very, very concrete reality – not just a
flower, more rooted in the earth. The Master finds roots into the earth
through the disciples. The Master belongs to the sky –</p><p>he can fly, he has wings, but he has no more roots. He can get roots
only through you. And when a Master has roots in the earth something of
immense value happens to the earth. An atmosphere, a soil is created. A
new psychology is created. In that psychology many many flowers will
bloom.</p><p><br></p><p>Love is a miracle. It is alchemy.</p><p><br></p><p>In THE LITTLE PRINCE this small story comes up.</p><p><br></p><p>He was with the fox. “I cannot play with you,” the fox said, “I am
not tamed.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh! Please excuse me,” said the little prince. But after some
thought he added, “What does that mean, ‘tame’?”</p><p><br></p><p>“It is an act too often neglected,” said the fox. “It means to
establish ties.” “To establish ties?”</p><p>“Just that,” said the fox. “To me, you are still nothing more than a
little boy who is just like a hundred thousand other little boys. And I
have no need of you. And you, on your part, have no need of me. To you I
am nothing more than a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes. But if
you tame me, then we shall need each other. To me, you will be unique in
all the world. To you, I shall be unique in all the world.<span class=s4></span>”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am beginning to understand,” said the little prince.</p><p><br></p><p>Between the Master and the disciple, the greatest tie of love
happens, the greatest taming happens. If you are not a disciple, I am
just one man amongst millions of men. To you, I don’t mean much. Once
you are a disciple then I am unique to you, then there is nobody who can
be compared to me. Once you are a disciple you are unique to me, ties
are established. I start growing roots through you... the meeting of the
sky and the earth. In that meeting all is possible, even the impossible
is possible.</p><p><br></p><p>Listening to me, don’t only listen to my words. Words are needed.
They are the container but not the content. And to know the difference
between the container and the content is the beginning of wisdom.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part4>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

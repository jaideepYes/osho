BUT WHAT IS THE ‘LADDER’ IN BETWEEN? WHAT IS THE PROCESS THAT HAPPENS IN BETWEEN? WHY DO YOU NOT TALK ABOUT THE ‘LADDER’?\nThe ladder exists not. There is no ladder. There is no in between. There is not any gap, it is all one. The earth and sky are not disconnected. They are already joined together. They are in a deep union, communion. The very idea of the ladder arises because we have been taught that there is a gap between this world and the other. There is none. It has not to be bridged. The other shore is in this shore. You are not to go anywhere, you are not to do anything. The potential is actual, and the first step is the last step. But the mind boggles down, the mind cannot conceive it. Mind always wants to have steps, ladders.\nMind can cope with a ladder, mind cannot cope with a quantum leap. Mind can cope with evolution, mind cannot cope with revolution. That’s why mind is never revolutionary; it is always orthodox, it is always conventional. Mind cannot be revolutionary by its very nature.\nYou have been taught again and again that the body and soul are two, that God and the world are two. And you have been taught that you have to find God against the world, you have to go beyond the world to find God.\nI am giving you a totally new message you are not to go beyond, you are to go within. The beyond is within, and the within is the beyond. All is herenow. In this very moment the whole existence is present in all its possibilities. It is only a shift of consciousness, not a ladder. It is a change of gestalt, not a ladder. Nothing changes, all remains the same – just a leap happens within you. Suddenly you start seeing things which you were not seeing but they were already present; they have always been present.\nHave you looked in some gestalt psychology books? – there are pictures. A famous picture is one picture where there is an old woman, and also, hidden in the same lines, is a young woman. You can see the old woman; if you go on looking and looking and looking, suddenly a moment will come and the consciousness will shift to another gestalt and you will start seeing the young woman. If you go on looking at the young woman long enough, suddenly something will change and you will start seeing the old woman again. When you have seen both and you know perfectly well that both are there, even then you cannot see both together. Because the old woman consists of the same lines, the young woman also consists of the same lines, you can see only one at one time. At another time you can see the other, but you cannot see both together, simultaneously.\nIf you see the world, you cannot see God, that’s true – but God is not opposite to the world, it is just another gestalt. If you see God the world disappears. It doesn’t mean that you have transcended the world. It is the same world, just your vision has made a new gestalt. That’s why you will find it again and again, down the ages, Charavakara, Epicurus, Karl Marx – all the materialists of the world say that only matter exists, consciousness is a by-product, an epi-phenomenon. Consciousness is illusory, the real thing is matter: this is one gestalt. They are not wrong.\nThen there is another tradition: Shankara, Vedantins, Berkeley, they say the world exists not, only God is, only consciousness is. Matter is illusory, MAYA. They are also not wrong; that is another gestalt – but no one is absolutely true either.\nThe real man of understanding will say that God can be looked at as the world, the world can be looked at as God.\nWilliam James is reported to have said, “Mind is one way in which the world is assembled and things put together; matter is another” – just ways of putting and assembling things together. Neither does matter exist against mind, nor does mind exist against matter. You are body – this is a gestalt; you are soul – that is another gestalt. There is no ladder in between, because these are two gestalts.\nRemember the picture again: is there a ladder between the old woman and the young woman? There is no ladder because they consist of the same lines. Nothing changes, the picture remains the same and you don’t go anywhere... but a shift, a flick in consciousness. You see things in one way, you assemble things in one way, then you see things in another way, you assemble things in another way. Neither are materialists right, absolutely right – they are not, they are partially true; nor are Vedantins right – they are partially true. They both suffer from partiality. That’s why their argument can continue forever, it will never be decisive.\nJust think of two persons arguing: “In this picture there is a young woman”, and another man says “There is an old woman.” They can go on arguing forever because they have partial truth, and it can never be decisive. They will never be able to commune with each other, they will never be able to\nunderstand what the other is saying, because how can one who has seen the young woman believe that the old woman exists there in the picture? and vice versa. The materialist and the spiritualist go on arguing.\nI am neither. I am simply saying to you that which is. Both exist, but both are not separate. We call them two because we can see them in two ways.\nYou ask me about the ladder – there is no ladder. I am not proposing any gradual, slow progress for you here. That’s how you have lived for many lives: thinking that gradually, gradually, slowly, slowly, you will attain. If you see my point you attain right now!\nBut you are looking for a ladder.\nSomebody has asked, “OSHO, THESE TALKS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE ON SUFISM, BUT YOU ARE NOT SAYING ANYTHING ABOUT SUFISM. YOU ARE SAYING MANY BEAUTIFUL THINGS BUT THEY ARE NOT SUFISM.”\nI am not talking about Sufism, that is true. I talk Sufism, not ABOUT Sufism! I am a Sufi, so whatsoever I say is Sufism. I am not giving you steps to move to the beyond, I am simply making my own experience available to you. I am simply sharing my being with you. This is not a message, it is a sharing. It is not a teaching, it is imparting. Being with me can reveal to you that nothing has to be achieved, that all goals are false, that all is already achieved.\nI don’t want you to BECOME enlightened. I declare that you are enlightened! But you are not courageous enough; you say, “How can I be enlightened? I will have to wait. Some day I will become enlightened.” You are so cowardly – that’s why you need time even to recognize your Godhood. You have condemned yourself so much that you cannot conceive that you can be a God. Because you cannot conceive that you can be a God, you cannot conceive how Buddha can be a God, how Christ can be a God.\nWhen Christ declares “I am God”, he’s simply saying to you “You are God. Look! I have the courage to declare. You also participate. See the point. I am as much of the flesh as you are, I am as much the body as you are.” There is nothing special about Christ; the only special thing is his courage. Otherwise he is just like you. I am just like you; the only thing is that I respect myself and you don’t respect yourself, I love myself and you don’t love yourself.\nYou are also very suspicious. That’s why I call myself Bhagwan. There are questions: “Why?” Because I am! And you are also, but you are not courageous. This Buddhafield is being created so that you can gather courage, so that you can become bold, so that you can say things as they are and you can see things as they are.\nI’m not supplying you with any ladder. You would like it very much, because then you can postpone. I am simply saying to you, jump... and be! Have a quantum leap!\nThere are not stations between you and God. The moment you are concentrated in your courage, suddenly the gestalt changes – God is revealed in millions of forms. And the moment you become God, the whole existence becomes God. If somebody says “I am God and you are not God”, then he is a cheat, he is a charlatan, he is playing a game, he is on an ego-trip.\nThe second question:\nQuestion 2\nSINCE RETURNING TO POONA TWO WEEKS AGO I FEEL MYSELF BECOMING ATTACHED TO YOU. BEFORE, I NEVER GAVE MUCH THOUGHT TO HOW LONG YOU WOULD REMAIN IN YOUR BODY AND NOW I AM WANTING YOU TO STAY A LONG TIME. I AM THINKING OF YOU IN MY FUTURE AS I HAVE WITH SO MANY OF MY OTHER ATTACHMENTS. I FEEL VERY STRONGLY THE DESIRE TO BE IN YOUR PHYSICAL PRESENCE RATHER THAN FEEL YOU WITH ME IN THE WEST. IS THIS A STEP A DISCIPLE GOES THROUGH IN COMING CLOSER TO A MASTER, OR IS SOMETHING GOING WRONG THAT I NEED BE AWARE OF?\nSambodhi, to be attached to me is the beginning of disciplehood. And this is not the kind of attachment that you have known before. Those attachments were a kind of bondage. You were attached to your chains, now you are becoming attached to freedom. To be attached to a Master is to be in love, to fall in love with freedom.\nA Master is one who makes freedom available to you. Be attached; don’t be worried. Just because of the word don’t be deceived, don’t think that you have known this attachment before. All those attachments were just on the way: they come and they go, they are momentary. This attachment will not go. You will go before this attachment. You will disappear. This attachment is going to kill you, to destroy you, to annihilate you. All those other attachments were not to annihilate you, they were to strengthen you. You fall in love with a man or a woman and you are attached, very much attached, because it enhances your ego. It gives you a sense of significance – you are somebody. You are attached to money because money enhances your ego. You are attached to power, respect, respectability, knowledge, because all those things give you a sense that you ARE.\nTo be attached to a Master is to commit suicide.\nThis is the right beginning, Sambodhi. Now you are really turning into a disciple, and I know this is happening.\nSambodhi has come here accidentally. She has come because of Amitabh, she has been in deep attachment with Amitabh. When Amitabh moved here, she came. Amitabh became a sannyasin so she became a sannyasin. But she was joined to me through Amitabh. Now, for the first time, I have seen the glimpse in her eyes that she is approaching me directly. Hence, this problem of attachment is arising. But this attachment is to something vast, something enormous – you will be lost in it.\nThis is new, radically new, and fear will arise, and the mind may rationalize that this is again an attachment. And the mind has never been against other attachments, remember. The mind was never afraid of other attachments, the mind was really always FOR attachments. Now, for the first time, the mind will say, “What are you doing? You are getting into attachment.” Now the mind will become a saint and sermonize to you that “This is attachment. Don’t get into this attachment. Beware, you are falling into a trap.”And this mind has never said this same thing to you. In fact it was always taking you into deeper attachments. Mind exists through attachments.\nNow this is a totally different kind of attachment – mind is afraid. The mind will say, “If you take this step, then this will be suicidal.” The mind will create new rationalizations, philosophize.\nSambodhi, you say, “Since returning to Poona two weeks ago” It is not only that you have become\naware. Two weeks ago when you came here and when I saw you for the first time, I had seen your eyes: they are turning towards me for the first time without Amitabh in between. This is a good sign. Now you have REALLY become a sannyasin. Now the initiation is happening. The first time it was so-so. I had initiated you because I knew the potential. I had seen the potential, that sooner or later you would fall in love with me, so for the time being, hang around. Any excuse would do – Amitabh is a beautiful excuse.\nAnd this will be helpful to Amitabh too, because he will be unburdened. He wanted deeply that Sambodhi should be directly related to me, not through him. He was feeling a little embarrassed. He w ill be happy that the thing has happened.\nNow don’t hesitate.\n“SINCE RETURNING TO POONA TWO WEEKS AGO I FEEL MYSELF BECOMING ATTACHED TO YOU. BEFORE I NEVER GAVE MUCH THOUGHT TO HOW LONG YOU WOULD REMAIN IN YOUR BODY AND NOW I AM WANTING YOU TO STAY A LONG TIME.”\nDisciplehood is born.\nAnd the Master is not only his soul, he is his body too. And when you come close to the Master, the first thing that starts changing you is his body. You will be surprised to know this, I have never said it before: his very matter starts changing your matter. His very matter becomes contagious. Your soul will be changed later on, it cannot be changed in the beginning. Things have to move from the outer towards the inner, from the exterior towards the interior. First the temple has to be changed, only then the deity. So there is naturally a deep attachment with the Master’s body. It is not just accidental that many Master’s bodies have been protected down the ages. In Tibet they have protected ninety-nine bodies down the ages. The very matter, the very body where enlightenment has been recognized and has happened, transforms its quality. It vibrates in a new rhythm. To be close to it is to be permeated by its vibration. To touch the body of the Master is to partake of his body. That is why Jesus says, “Eat me, drink me.”\nA Master has to be eaten, drunk. A Master has to be digested, chewed, so he enters into the deepest matter of your being. The body is the beginning and the beginning has to be transformed. Only a transformed body will know a transformed being. Only in a different rhythm of the body will you know God, because the gestalt will change.\nSo it is very natural that disciples become attached to the body of their Master. Even when the Master is gone the body will be worshipped. Just a hair of Mohammed is kept in Shrinagar, in a mosque – just a single hair! – and it has tremendous effect on those who know how to be in the presence of that single hair because that single hair has the same vibe as Mohammed. It continues to vibrate in the same way. It contains the subtlest message: the real Koran is contained in that hair.\nThe tree under which Buddha became enlightened has been preserved for twenty-five centuries, because the tree has a different vibe. No other tree in the whole world has that vibe. It is unique, it has seen something happening. When Buddha was transformed, naturally the tree absorbed all those vibrations. It drank. Those vibrations penetrated into the very fibers of the tree. The tree still\nvibrates in the same way. Still, to sit under the Bodhi Tree is a tremendous experience – but only if you know. If you are aware and alert and in love with Buddha, then the secret of the tree will be revealed to you.\nEven while a Master is alive only those who are perceptive, feel; but those who are really perceptive go on feeling even when the Master is gone. Any small thing from the Master’s body – the room in which he lived, the tree under which he became enlightened – has some quality, something of the beyond.\nEnlightenment is as contagious as any disease. And when a great Master exists the disease starts taking epidemic proportions. You are not here just to hear me, because that you can do by reading books, by listening to the tapes. You are here to partake of my being, you are here to partake of the matter that has become transformed with me. So it is a natural desire, nothing wrong in it.\n“BEFORE I NEVER GAVE MUCH THOUGHT TO HOW LONG YOU WOULD REMAIN.”\nYou were not concerned with me, now you are concerned. You were not involved with me, now you are involved. You were not committed to me, now you are committed. Now somehow my destiny is going to be your destiny too.\n“NOW I AM WANTING YOU TO STAY A LONG TIME.”\nIf you need meeven if a single person needs me I will be staying a long time. It will depend on\nyour need. How much you need me, that much I can stay. My own needs are fulfilled, I can go any moment. There is nothing more left. All that has to be done has been done and all that has to be experienced has been experienced. I am fulfilled. This moment I am ready to go, or the next moment any moment is perfectly okay now.\nBut if you need me, your very need will sustain me in the body. If you desire me and my presence, if your thirst is strong enough, that can keep me in the body. ONLY that can keep me. My own roots in the body are no longer there. But your need, your desires, your longing, your search for truth – if it is strong enough, big enough, it is possible for me to stay long enough. It all depends on you.\nSo don’t be worried that you are falling into some wrong kind of desire. This is absolutely natural.\n“I FEEL VERY STRONGLY THE DESIRE TO BE IN YOUR PHYSICAL PRESENCE RATHER THAN FEEL YOU WITH ME IN THE WEST.”\nThere is no problem; then just be here, Sambodhi. I am creating this Buddhafield for all those who need to be with me, who want to be not only spiritually connected with me but materially too. I am a material spiritualist, or a spiritual hedonist. Any paradox will do to describe me.\nThe third question:\nQuestion 3\nYOU SPOKE TODAY OF LOVE AND DEATH AND THE IMPORTANCE OF EXPERIENCING LOVE TO PASS CONSCIOUSLY INTO DEATH. I HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED DEEP LOVE,\nONLY SUPERFICIAL ATTACHMENTS. I DO NOT LOVE EVEN MYSELF SO HOW CAN I LOVE ANOTHER? I KNOW THERE IS NOTHING I CAN DO REGARDING THIS IMPASSE AS THERE IS A SEASON FOR ALL THINGS AND AT THE RIGHT TIME WHAT IS NEEDED HAPPENS. IS THERE ANYTHING MORE I CAN DO THAN WAIT?\nFirst, don’t console yourself. Consolation is not the way to real understanding. It is true that there is nothing that you can do, but this can be just a consolation, a kind of defeatism. Then it is untrue. Even a truth can be used as a lie; it all depends on you. This is just in your mind: “What can I do? So I have to wait.” But your waiting will be impotent because it will be out of a kind of defeatism, out of a kind of pessimism.\nThere is another kind of waiting which is not impotent, a waiting which is aflame, a waiting which is passionate, a waiting which is prayerful, a waiting which does not come as a consolation but comes as an understanding.\nWhat is understanding? Understanding is: “I cannot do on my own, but God can do through me.” And any time is the right time, and any season is the right season. There are not seasons when enlightenment happens, just as it happens that in the spring all flowers bloom. If there were seasons when enlightenment happened, then many people would have become enlightened when Buddha became enlightened, then many people would have become enlightened when I became enlightened. There are not seasons. As far as enlightenment is concerned, it is always spring, it is always the right season. But why is it not happening to you?\nAnd I say waiting is the only thing that can be done – but remember, it has to be a waiting full of prayer, full of longing, of a great intensity; not impotent, not lethargic; waiting with a very, very active energy, not just passivity. And these are two different kinds of waitings.\nWhen you wait for your beloved there is not passivity: you are all aflame, you are full of energy. In fact you are never so full of energy as when you are waiting for your beloved. You are all awareness. Just a dead leaf moves in the wind on the road, and you rush, and you open the door – “Maybe she has come?” A postman passes by and his footsteps are heard, and you run – “Maybe she has come!” Everything, every sound, becomes her sound. The wind comes and knocks on the door, and you run – “So she has come!” It is not lethargy, you are not lying down on your bed. You are very, very actively waiting.\nMy feeling is that the questioner is in a kind of defeatism, pessimism, lethargy. If you are waiting in lethargy it will not happen. Then no season is spring.\nThe energy has to be totally there, vibrating, pulsating, streaming – and yet you are waiting, you are not doing anything. What can you do? What can be done? Man as himself is tiny, but man can pray, man can cry and weep.\nLet your waiting be full of tears, let your waiting be full of prayers. Let your waiting be not just passive but immensely, intensely active. That is the doing that is needed. You will have to make the distinction very clearly.\nThe real opposition is not between waiting and doing. The real opposition is between active waiting and passive waiting. Active waiting and passive waiting are the enemies. Doing and non-doing are not the enemies.\nYou say, “YOU SPOKE TODAY OF LOVE AND DEATH AND THE IMPORTANCE OF EXPERIENCING LOVE TO PASS CONSCIOUSLY INTO DEATH. I HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED DEEP LOVE – ONLY SUPERFICIAL ATTACHMENTS.”\nThe reason may be that because you called those attachments superficial, that’s why you have not been able to experience deep love. You condemned. To call anything superficial is to prevent yourself from going deeply into it. Nobody wants to go into anything superficial. But the word is significant. What does superficial mean? It simply means that you are just touching the surface of it. If you go deep into it, it will become deep. Every superficiality has a depth in it, otherwise it would not be superficial either. The surface of the ocean is possible only because the depth of the ocean is there. The surface contains the depth and the depth cannot be there without the surface. Just see the point.\nAnything superficial can become deep, it depends on you; and anything deep can remain superficial, that too depends on you. And people have been taught to condemn all superficial things. That’s why they are debarred from experiencing the depth of life. Everything is superficial. You fall in love with a woman – this is superficial. You have a friendship – that is superficial. You love flowers – that is superficial, because flowers are momentary. And your religions go on saying, “Search for the eternal. Don’t fall in love with the momentary.” And the momentary contains the eternal! The moment is eternity. Because the wave contains the ocean, if you condemn the wave you will never know what the ocean is.\nDrop condemnations. Forget all these words – superficial, momentary, temporal, worldly – these are all dangerous words. Once you start using them, once you get accustomed to them, you are prevented from every depth. It is like you condemn the door: you say, “A door is a door. I am in search of the temple.” But wherever you will go you will find the door first, and then the temple. And you are against the door, so you go on moving and you never reach any temple. The door belongs to the temple. It is as divine as the deity within.\nLearn to respect the momentary and soon the eternal will knock on your doors. Love the superficial too! Love the physical too! Be sensuous, be sexual. Don’t condemn, because these are the doors. Only through these doors will you enter into something which is non-sexual, non-sensuous. This is the mystery of life: that sensuality leads to non-sensuality, sexuality leads to non-sexuality. The body leads into soul, and the world becomes the door to the divine, to God.\n“I HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED,” you say, “DEEP LOVE.”\nHow can you experience deep love? First, all that you experience you call superficial. Second, you have not experienced deep love but you must have some idea what a deep love is supposed to be – a perfectionist ideal that deep love has to be ‘like this’. And you will never find it, because in life everything is mixed. In life the sky and the earth are mixed: you will never find pure sky and you will never find pure earth either. You will be surprised to know that all the great religions spread into the world by the same routes from where all great epidemics spread; the same routes have been followed by religions too. The same route that the plague spreads by is the route Christianity moves on. But you cannot condemn just because the same route has been followed.\nEverything is mixed in life. You have to learn that life has a multiplicity in it, and you have to start decoding different things in life. Decode the surface and you will reach to the profound depth. Get\ninto the body and how long can you avoid the soul? People have great ideas about love, how love should be; they have impossible ideals about love. Then they cannot fulfill that ideal and they feel condemned.\nDrop all ideals of love. You don’t know what love is! All that you know you call superficial, and all that you don’t know you gather from poets and philosophers – who may have gathered from other poets and from other philosophers, and this goes on and on. You don’t know what profound love is. You know the superficial. So it is perfectly good, for the moment. Go into the superficial, go totally into it, and by going totally into it you will come across the deep, the profound. And then you will be surprised that it has NO connection with the ideals that people are carrying. It is so indefinable that no definition has ever been just and fair to it. And it is so mysterious that no explanation is possible. It cannot be reduced to any theory. Accept the ordinary; the extraordinary is hidden in it.\nAnd your waiting seems to be just a dull, passive, dead waiting, a kind of great lethargy. God will not happen, this is not the waiting for God. Only death will happen. Out of this kind of waiting only death happens, nothing else.\nAnd don’t postpone, don’t play games. These are mind games. You say, “I KNOW THERE IS NOTHING I CAN DO”\nHow do you know? How do you know that nothing can be done? Have you done ALL that can be done? Have you come to this point by your own experience, that nothing can be done? Then you would not have asked the question: “Is there anything more I can do than wait?” You are still searching to do something. This is not your experience; there is still some desire to do. There is something still groping in the dark, but you are consoling yourself that “There is a season for all things and at the right time what is needed happens.”\nThis is cliche. Drop it. You have heard it repeated too often, it has entered into your mind. This is just consoling yourself. This consolation will become poison. This is a way for the mind to postpone. The mind never wants to get into anything – it only desires, it lives in desiring. In fact if what it desires happens the mind is immediately frustrated with it.\nThere is a beautiful poem of Rabindranath Tagore:\n“I searched for God for many, many lives, and I saw Him always far away, somewhere passing by the side of a star. And my longing became greater and greater and greater, and I searched and searched. And I was very happy in my search, immensely happy in my search. Then one day it happened: I reached the house where God lived. I read the nameplate. I was thrilled, I was all joy – so I have arrived! I was just going to knock on the door, then the mind said,”Wait a minute. Think about it twice. You may really find Him there. Then what? If He is really there, then what will you do? How will you live? You live through desire for Him, you live through desire. You are a seeker, a searcher; that is the only way you know how to be. If you have found Him you will be stuck. Then what will you do?’” And Rabindranath said, “I really became frightened. All joy disappeared.” Yes, this was something very, very important to be considered – “If I knock on the door and He opens the door and embraces me, then what? Then where do I go from there? Then I am stuck in His embrace And He may be beautiful, but that is the end of me and my world and the ways that I have\nalways known, and it has been so beautiful searching and seeking.” He says, “I took my shoes off my feet and carried them in my hands down the staircase because I was afraid He might hear the noise, ‘Somebody is there,’ and He might open without my knocking. Then I escaped, and I ran as fast as I have ever run before. Since then I have been running from Him, and I don’t look back. I have again started searching and again started asking people ‘Where is God?’ And I again see Him sometimes, somewhere there, far away in the stars. I start searching and I go on searching, and all the time I know where He lives so I avoid that house. I go everywhere else.”\nMind exists in desiring. And the best way to continue desire is to lie down in a deep lethargy and wait for the right season to come. It never comes – because the right season is always there. Only when you are intensely aflame does it come; otherwise it is there. When you are aflame, when you become spring, you are immediately in contact with the spring which is eternally present. Don’t be lethargic.\nI have heard.…\nThe frogs who had been out on the tiles were suffering from a terrific hangover. “Oh dear,” remarked one, “I wish we had some aspirin.” At that moment a tortoise who had ambled by overheard his remarks and said, “I say, you fellows, I will go down to the village and get you some aspirin, if it will be of any help.”\n“Ah, my dear fellow, would you really? That’s most kind of you to offer,” replied the frog. And the tortoise started off.\nWell after about two weeks there was no sign of any aspirin or the return of the tortoise. So one frog said to the other, “I say, do you think that tortoise can be relied upon? He has been gone an awfully long time.”\nAt this remark the tortoise, who had been having a quiet rest behind a boulder, said, “If you speak like that behind my back, I jolly well won’t go and get that aspirin. So there!”\nYou can live in a kind of lethargy for ever and ever; nothing will happen to you. And I am not saying that God does not happen to those who wait. He happens only to those who wait! but waiting has a different quality. Waiting has to be aflame, only then does God happen. Every fiber of your being should be awake, alert: any moment it is going to happen, how can you fall asleep?\nJesus is reported to have said again and again to his disciples, “Be awake. Don’t fall asleep.” And he tells the parable where a Master told his servants, “I am going on a pilgrimage but I may return any day, any moment, day or night. You have to be awake for twenty-four hours because I may come at any time, and I will come without informing you.”\nThis is the situation: the servants have to keep watch day and night. They have to be alert, the Master can come at any moment.\nGod can come at any moment – you have to be alert, watchful. Your waiting should be alert, watchful, intense. That is your doing. Waiting is not against doing. Waiting is the highest kind of doing, the subtlest kind of doing. Waiting is the greatest art of doing.\nThe fourth question:\nQuestion 4\nWHY IS IT SAID THAT LIFE IS STRANGER THAN FICTION?\nBecause life is! Fictions are only reflections of life; how can they be stranger than life? Fictions are only parts of life. Life is a very complicated whole: it does not begin, it does not end. Your fiction starts and ends.\nI know a person who always reads his novels from the middle. I asked him, “What is the point?” He said, “This way you remain more in suspense – the end is not known, the beginning is not known. If you start from the beginning you are only curious about the end. I am curious in a double way. I enjoy it more totally!”\nLife is like that – it is always in the middle. You are always in the middle, the beginning is not known. Religions have tried somehow to supply the beginning. All those philosophies on how the world began are just nonsense, because the world never began. It has always been in the middle. That is the mystery, but the mind hankers for the beginning.\nAnd then there are people who supply the answers. They say, “On a certain day God created the world.” And what had He been doing before that? Just sitting there stupidly? And how long had He been sitting? Christians say, “God created the world EXACTLY four thousand and four years before Jesus – on a certain Monday He started, and ended by Saturday evening, and rested on Sunday.” Then what w as He doing before that? – immense eternity! He must have got bored. In fact Eve must have committed suicide or must have gone mad.\nThe world never began. How can there be a beginning to the total? Because even if the beginning is conceived you will need a few things before the beginning, and then it will not be the beginning. You will need space. God says, “Let there be light!” But where? THERE IS needed. Time will be needed. How can Monday start suddenly without time? It needs a Sunday before it, otherwise how will you call it Monday? It will be so absurd.\nNo, the world has no beginning and the world has no end. It simply goes on and on and on, and everything is so complicated and everything is so intertwined with everything else that nothing is separate. I am in you, you are in me. You are in the trees, trees are in you. Rocks are in you, you are in the rocks. The farthest corner – if there is any – is connected to you. Touch a small pebble and you have touched the whole of existence. Kiss a woman and you have kissed the totality, because that woman is part of totality. When you kiss a woman you have kissed her mother too, and the mother’s mother. You may not like it... but nothing can be done about it – millions and millions of mothers-in-law, standing in a queue behind your woman, from the very beginning. And you have also kissed the child that is going to be born to the woman, and the children’s children, and the whole future. Because the woman will go on reverberating, she will live in the daughter, and the daughter’s daughter, and she will go on living in millions of ways.\nWhen you kiss a woman you have kissed the whole past and you have also kissed the whole future. Touch reality anywhere and you touch the total. And the total is so immense, immeasurable.\nLife is very strange because it is a great mystery. I have heard about a certain Doctor Smartass.\nOnce upon a time there were two young men who became close friends. While sitting and talking at lunch one day, much to their surprise they discovered that they were both in treatment with the same psychotherapist, Doctor Smartass. As they compared notes, they agreed that the doctor was competent and helpful. He was also maddeningly composed and pompously sure of himself. If only there was some way to shake him up, to make him feel as unsettled as he made them feel.\nGleefully they hit upon a scheme to unhorse the good doctor. Together they made up an elaborate dream, rehearsing the telling of it until each could present it as his own. That Monday would be the day of reckoning. The first young man would go in for his appointment in the morning and tell the therapist ‘his’ dream. His friend would repeat the performance in his own session that same afternoon. Let’s see how Doctor Smartass would handle that one.\nOn Monday the first young man went to his session and told his carefully rehearsed dream. He hid his secret glee as he had the therapist work on interpreting the dream. That afternoon, his friend gave a brilliant straight-faced performance as he too recounted the dream as if it were his own. Every detail of the second telling was the same as the first.\nHe was delighted to see an uncharacteristic look of bewilderment come across the therapist’s face. “God, that’s strange,” said the doctor. “That’s the THIRD time today I have heard that exact same dream.”\nLife IS strange. Things really happen here.\nLife is unexplainable. All explanations fall short. All explanations are stupid, silly. The real people who understand the mystery of life don’t give you any explanation about it. They help you to experience the mystery but they don’t de-mystify it. That’s where science and religion depart from each other. The whole effort of science is to de-mystify existence, to explain everything – and whenever a thing is explained the wonder is lost. Then love becomes nothing but hormones, then falling in love is nothing but chemistry. Then all that you do and all that happens to you becomes very mundane, very ordinary, very superficial, not worth doing really.\nJust think... you are falling in love with a woman because of your chemistry. Because certain chemicals are released in your body, certain hormones are moving in your blood, that’s why you are feeling sexual, attracted. If those hormones are taken out, if that chemistry is changed, you would not feel attracted. All love will disappear. The moment you think of the chemistry of love, love disappears. Then there is only chemistry – two chemistries getting attracted to each other – almost victims of chemistry. The joy, the gladness, the glory, the splendor – all are gone.\nThe scientist tries to supply answers, although the scientist has failed – but people have not yet heard about it. This century has seen one of the greatest phenomena: the scientist has failed, UTTERLY failed! – because the scientist has come closer and closer to truth, and the closer the scientist comes to the truth the more bewildered he becomes. The closer he comes to truth the more the truth seems to be more and more mysterious, unknowable.\nAlbert Einstein said before he died, “The world to mc is now more unknowable than it was when I started my work. I had started with the idea that I would find a few explanations, I would make things better explained, a little bit, but I would help to create a few explanations. But all those explanations that existed in my youth are no longer there. I am simply bewildered. I am dying not as a physicist but as a mystic. And next time, if I am to come back, I would like to be born as a plumber rather than as a physicist.”\nA great statement... because the plumber knows more about the mystery, lives it, enjoys it. By ‘plumber’ he means, “I would like to be an ordinary person, a very ordinary person – a farmer, a gardener, a plumber. I would not bother about de-mystifying existence. I would rather live it, experience it. I would rather sing about it and dance about it.”\nLife IS strange, and that is the basic contribution of religion to the world. Religion helps you to go into the mystery without de-mystifying. That’s where theology goes wrong. Theology is NOT religion. Theology is again the same endeavor as science – trying to find explanations. Zen Masters are right when they laugh at your questions, and Sufis are perfectly right when they answer your questions in absurd ways. The answer does not relate to the question at all. If you become puzzled, it is a great step. If you forget your knowledge, if you unlearn your explanations, it is really a great step towards God.\nLive without explanation and you will live a religious life. The fifth question:\nQuestion 5\nI FEEL A RAPPORT WITH YOUR WRITINGS – ALMOST LIKE A CONTEMPORARY. SURELY THIS FEELING WILL CHANGE IF I BECOME A SANNYASIN. WILL THIS CHANGE BE BENEFICIAL?\nTo feel en rapport with my writings is one thing, to feel en rapport is totally another. To be convinced by my writings will not change you, it will simply add to your knowledge. To fall en rapport with me will destroy you, annihilate you, will transform you. When you are reading you are the master, you own the book, and you can go on finding ways and means to defend yourself against the book. And the book cannot do much; you are free to interpret it in your own ways.\nThat’s what you must be doing. That’s why you are saying, “I feel a rapport with your writings – almost like a contemporary.” Your ego is being fulfilled through them.\nWhat is actually happening is you are not being convinced by what I say, you are really convinced that whatsoever you have been thinking before is right! – “Osho also agrees with me.” That’s what you think falling en rapport is. It is not you getting into agreement with me, it is me getting into agreement with you. And with a book, that you can do very easily: you can forget those portions that don’t agree with you or you can interpret them in such a way that they start appearing to be in agreement with you. The book is dead. You can do anything to the book.\nI am alive. And I am SO contradictory. I relish contradictions. That is my nourishment – that if you agree with me today, tomorrow I will create trouble. If you agree with me again, next day I will create\ntrouble again. By and by you will relax and you will forget agreeing with me: “What is the point? This man goes on contradicting himself every day.”\nThis is a device so that you stop agreeing with me through the mind. Then arises a different kind of agreement – a conversion – you start agreeing with my being. That is true rapport.\nSannyas is nothing but a gesture from your side that you are ready to go with me into the dark unknown, that you trust me, that now you are ready not only to listen to my thoughts, you are ready to listen to my silence too. The book can give you only the thoughts, it cannot give the pauses in between. And they are really valuable, they are really significant, not the words.\nLooking into my eyes is more significant than reading my books. Sitting close to me, feeling me, being overwhelmed by me, opening your heart towards me – that is the real thing. The book has only one work to do: it can bring you to me, that’s all. Then its work is finished. The book is not the end, the book is just the beginning. Don’t get stuck there.\nYou must be feeling very good; that’s why you say, “almost I feel like a contemporary.” You are not! – because to be contemporary with me you will have to exist in no-time, because I exist in no-time. I don’t exist in the twentieth century. I am not a thinker. You can be contemporary with Bertrand Russell. If you think in the same way, with the same logic, with the same conclusions, you are contemporary with Bertrand Russell – but to be contemporary with Buddha is a totally different phenomenon. You will have to go deep into silence because Buddha exists in silence, Buddha exists in no-time. He exists in eternity. That’s why even TODAY you can become a contemporary with Buddha, even today you can become a contemporary with Lao Tzu, and for centuries to come you can at any time become contemporary with a Christ. Whenever you transcend time you become contemporary with enlightened people.\nJust by agreeing with my thoughts you will not become my contemporary. You will be contemporaneous to my thoughts, that’s all – but not to me. And I am not a thought but an experience.\nYou ask me, “SURELY THIS FEELING WILL CHANGE IF I BECOME A SANNYASIN.”\nSurely. It is going to change, it has to change. You will feel totally differently. The ego will start disappearing. It will hurt.\nBecoming a sannyasin means you have become a disciple. Now you will put your mind aside, now you will get more and more in tune with my vibe. This in the East WE call SATSANGA: to be in the presence of the Master, to see the Master, to touch the Master, to be touched by the Master, to be seen by the Master. It is not a verbal communication. Verbal communication has its own purpose. Because you cannot start without verbal communication, that’s why I have to go on speaking. If I had been totally silent here you would not be here. You are here because I have spoken.\nBut if you remain here only just to hear me you miss the whole point. Then you will gather only words; those words will turn dead in your hands. Howsoever alive and warm they are when I release them, the moment they get into your clutches they will be cold, dead stones. Unless you become contemporaneous with my being... and that can happen only in meditation. Meditation is the bridge between the Master and the disciple.\nYou will change, surely you will change. But YOU HAVE to change! Are you not yet bored with yourself? Only a dull person can remain happy in the ordinary way, only an insensitive person can remain happy in an ordinary way. A sensitive person, sooner or later, starts feeling, “I am moving in a rut,” that “I am moving in a vicious circle.” The more sensitive you are, the sooner you recognize that there is a need to be transformed, radically transformed, that there is a need to go through a revolution, that one needs a breakdown and a breakthrough.\nThe sixth question:\nQuestion 6\nI HAVE HEARD THAT AT THE TIME OF GIVING SANNYAS TO YOUR MOTHER, YOU HAD STEPPED OFF YOUR CHAIR AND TOUCHED THE FEET OF YOUR MOTHER. THIS UNIQUE SITUATION HAS THRILLED ME. PLEASE QUENCH MY DESIRE FOR KNOWING SOME MORE. WHO IS GREATER – MOTHER OR GURU?\nThey are greater than each other.\nAsking that question is wrong. The very formulation: it is just like asking, “Which is greater – the hen or the egg?” You don’t understand. You divide hen and egg; they are indivisible. The hen is a state of the egg, the egg is a state of the hen.\nTo ask: Who is greater – mother or guru, mother or Master? is possible only if you don’t understand what a mother is and what a Master is. Both are to be respected for a certain thing that is common to both: they both give birth. That’s why they are respected. The mother gives birth to the physical being, the first birth is through the mother. The second birth is through the Master. The Master is a mother! Becoming a disciple means getting into the womb of the Master. A Buddhafield is a womb. To enter into the womb of the Master, to enter into his milieu, to become part of his energy – the second birth happens. You become a twice-born, a DWIJA. This is what Jesus means when he says,,“Unless you are born again.”\nA second birth is a must, otherwise you will live only as a physical being. The mother has given you just the physical being. The temple has been created by the mother, the deity has to be born yet through a Master.\nThe English word ‘mother’ and the English word ‘matter’, both come from the same root. They both come from the same Sanskrit root, MATHRA. It is beautiful that mother and matter both come from the same root. What does it mean?\nThe mother gives you matter, she supplies you with matter. The mother is your matter, she is your body. The mother is the earth, the Master is the sky. But remember, without the earth the sky cannot happen. Without the temple the deity is not possible. So the mother has given you an opportunity. but that is only an opportunity. You will have to find a Master to transform the opportunity into a realization.\nNow this is a problem: who is more respectable, who is greater?\nWithout the mother you would not be here, and the Master could not work. Without the Master you would be here but your being here would be pointless. In fact, respecting the mother and the Master are both for the same reason – because they both give birth. Naturally, the higher birth is given by the Master, so the Master is greater. But the foundation is laid down by the mother, so the mother is greater. That’s why I say they are greater than each other.\nAnd you have asked, “I HAVE HEARD THAT AT THE TIME OF GIVING SANNYAS TO YOUR MOTHER, YOU HAD STEPPED OFF YOUR CHAIR AND TOUCHED THE FEET OF YOUR MOTHER. THIS UNIQUE SITUATION HAS THRILLED ME. PLEASE QUENCH MY DESIRE FOR KNOWING SOME MORE.”\nIt is a strange phenomenon. Very rarely does it happen that a mother comes to become a disciple of her own son. Mary never became a disciple to Christ, and Christ was angry about it. He wanted, because he wanted all that he had become to be shared with the mother. But the mother never became a disciple; that’s why the strange statement. Jesus was surrounded by a crowd and Mary came, and somebody in the crowd said... the crowd was too much and she could not enter, and she wanted to have a talk with Jesus... somebody said, “Your mother is waiting for you outside the crowd. She wants to see you.” And Jesus said, “I have nothing to do with that woman.” It looks ugly. Those words on Jesus’ lips don’t fit. But why does he say “I don’t have anything to do with that woman”? She remained a woman. Jesus was angry, and his anger can be understood. It is out of love that he was angry. He wanted his mother to be transformed. He was sharing his light with strangers, and his own mother and his own father would remain in darkness. He was sad about it. His sadness showed in his anger.\nWhen my mother came to be initiated by me, I touched her feet because she proved to be a rare mother. To bow down to your own son is really arduous and hard. It is almost impossible to touch the feet of your own son – it needs great courage. It needs great risk to drop all your ego. I touched her feet not because she is my mother, I touched her feet because she dared! I touched her feet for the same reason, for the SAME I say, that Jesus was angry. The reason is the same: I was immensely happy. It is rare, happens only once in a while. And I touched her feet also for another thing: because after that she would not be my mother and I would not be her son. The account has to be closed as beautifully as possible.\nIt was a drastic step. She had always thought about me as her son. Now, no more. Now she would be my disciple and I would be her Master. Up to then she had been giving advice to me, she had been directing me – “Do this and don’t do that.” Now all that is not possible. Now I will be directing her, I will be giving advice to her, I will be ordering her to do this or that. The whole situation is going to be radically changed.\nShe risked.\nI respected her courage, I respected her egolessness. And the account has to be closed beautifully: this was the last time I would be a son to her; it will remain in her consciousness forever. Since that moment all the ties have been broken. It was the beginning of a new relationship. I touched her feet not only because she is my mother. I touched her feet because she dared, she dared a lot. She dropped her ego.\nAnd the last question:\nQuestion 7\nIT IS TRUE THAT IN A VERY CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WHEN ONE ‘PLAYS’ THE GOOD, UNDERSTANDING, CALM AND RELAXED ONE, IT IS ONLY LEFT FOR THE OTHER TO BE NERVOUS, TENSE AND ANGRY? PLEASE EXPLAIN.\nYes, a certain kind of balancing always happens in relationship. If one is playing very calm and quiet and cool, the other will have to do all the work of being angry, nagging, miserable, fighting.\nJust a few days ago Chaitanya Hari had asked a question, “Why did Socrates continue to live with this naggy-daggy woman, Xanthippe?”\nThe question is relevant, because he is also living with a naggy-daggy woman, Krishna. But remember, Socrates was responsible. He was playing too cool, too philosophical. Xanthippe was not as bad as she appears. If you go into the psychology of it, she was the victim of a philosopher. She had to do all the work, the poor woman.\nAnd so is the case with Krishna! Krishna was saying to me, “Osho, do you think this Chaitanya Hari is a saint?” He is not! He only pretends! Now Chaitanya Hari is also responsible if Krishna turns out to be a Xanthippe. She alone will not be responsible.\nThere is a kind of balancing. Whenever two persons are together a balancing happens. Don’t try to play cool, otherwise the other will have to become more hot than needed. Don’t try to play like heaven, otherwise the other will become hell. Be natural, be normal. It is sometimes good to be angry and sometimes good to be sad, and sometimes to be hellish and sometimes to be heavenly.\nThen both remain natural, then both remain normal. A normal relationship is a hell-heaven relationship. When one is – pretends to be – heavenly or hellish, then the other is not left with anything else. The only role left is to do the opposite. This has to be understood. This is one of the greatest problems in the world.\nI have heard.…\nOnce Avicenna, an Arabian physician and philosopher, hearing of the spiritual fame of Abel Hasan Khargani, visited the Master at his home in Khargani. At the time the Master was absent from his home, having gone to the nearby jungles to fetch firewood at the request of his wife. When his wife was asked by Avicenna where the Master was, she replied hotly, “Why do you wish to see that lunatic and imposter? What business have you with him?” And she went on at length criticizing and belittling the Master, and disparaging his spiritual status.\nAvicenna was greatly perplexed. What she said contradicted what he had previously heard, and he felt disinclined to continue his search for him. However, seeing he had come so far just to see the Master, he finally decided to do so. On going towards the jungle he was astounded to see approaching him the Master returning from the jungle with a great bundle of firewood loaded on the back of a tiger.\nThe philosopher, after paying respects, inquired of the Master the meaning of and difference between what he had been told by the wife and what he had seen with his own eyes.\nThe Master replied, “There is nothing amazing about it. It is a mere question of labor. When I put up with and bear the load of suffering from the wolf (read ‘wife’) in my house, then automatically this tiger from the jungle carries my load for me.”\nThe Sufi Master is saying “There is a kind of balancing in existence too.” Not only is there a balancing between Xanthippe and Socrates, there is a balancing between this couple and existence too. Socrates was immensely respected by people; disrespected by the wife, tortured by the wife, but respected by the people.\nThis story is beautiful. Khargani is saying, “It is a mere question of labor, there is nothing amazing about it. When I put up with and bear the load of suffering from the wolf in my house, then automatically this tiger from the jungle carries my load for me.”\nAlways remember, life can exist only in balance. It has always been so. Good women always find bad husbands, and good husbands always find bad women, bad wives. It is such that there is no exception to it. There cannot be any exception to it.\nOne man went to Socrates and asked, “I would like to be married. I am young. What do you suggest, because I have heard so many stories about your married life? You are the most experienced person about marriage. I have come for your advice. What should I do? Is it right to get married, or is it good to remain a bachelor? Which is more blissful?”\nSocrates said, “You better get married.” The young man said, “You puzzle me.”\nSocrates: “There is nothing to be puzzled about, it is simple. If you get such a woman as I have got, you will become a great philosopher. I have had to become! This is sheer necessity! Just to survive I have had to become tranquil and meditative and silent. This has helped me immensely. And if you get a good wife you will be happy, if you get a bad wife you will become a philosopher. In both ways you will be profited. Get married!”\nBut I cannot say that Socrates is not responsible in Xanthippe’s behavior. And I cannot say that Sufi Master Abel Hasan Khargani is not responsible in his wife’s behavior.\nThat’s why in the East many seekers of truth have remained bachelors. There is a reason for it. The reason is, the fundamental reason is – not that you cannot attain to truth with a wife – because of compassion, because if you become too meditative living with a wife, you will destroy her being. She will start balancing, she will become ugly, she will become negative. If you are all positivity she will become negativity. Then you will be committing a crime against her, and you will be responsible for it. Down the ages, in the East, seekers of truth have remained bachelors. It is just out of compassion: why destroy another human being?\nSocrates was so silent, so meditative, so involved in his search for truth: the wife simply felt neglected, ignored. She wanted his attention. I can see it happening – pouring the kettle-bottle on him she was simply asking for attention. He must have been too cold, so she was making him a little hot. He must have been in a kind of dispassion, she was trying to create some passion in him. If he could be angry, then he could be loving too.\nBut he was not angry. He used it as a device: he became even more calm and quiet. He allowed that hot water to burn his body, but he remained a witness. Now this must have driven the wife more crazy. How can you forgive such a husband who will not jump and hit you back? If he had hit the wife back the wife would have become cooler.\nIf you are married it is better to remain normal. Your search for truth should be interior. In your relationship with the wife or with the husband you should remain a normal human being. Otherwise you will be committing a crime, a sin: you will destroy the woman or the man. Then meditate when you are alone. And sometimes if it is needed, be angry! Just in play, act it, even if it is not needed, because once you have decided to live with a woman or a man you have certain responsibilities to fulfill. You have to be angry sometimes too – that is your responsibility.\nIf Chaitanya Hari does not understand, then Krishna is going to become a naggy-daggy woman, and half of the responsibility will be his.\nNow he sits silently and meditates upon music – and in the middle of the night! Krishna jumps on him and beats him. No wife can tolerate this, no woman can tolerate that she is there, alive, warm, full of love, wants to be hugged, cared for, caressed – and you are sitting there thinking of music? It can’t be allowed, it is too much. I have all sympathy for Krishna. All that she wants is, “Come to bed. Hug me, be with me. It is enough. The whole day you have been thinking about music and meditation, there is a time to relax too.”\nIf one decides to be in a relationship one has to take care not to destroy the other, not to throw the other to the polarity too much. Life balances itself. If you are all positive the other becomes all negative. So be fifty-fifty, negative-positive both, so the other also remains fifty-fifty, negative-positive both. And when both are both, there is a kind of beautiful relationship, a beauty arises. There is great music and harmony. They become an orchestra.\nIf it is not happening it is better to be a bachelor, it is better to be alone. At least you will not be disturbing any other human being.\nThe East is right: if you are a seeker after truth it is better to be alone. And if you are already in a relationship and then the search for truth has started, then at least you can act. There is no need to be really angry, you can act and that will do. You can be hot sometimes. At least you can show it – that much you owe to the other.\nA story... Krishna and Chaitanya Hari have to meditate over it.\nWearied from the long drive, the model stopped at a motel, only to be told that the last room had just been rented, but if she didn’t mind, there was a couch in one room which she could use provided the male occupant of the room had no objection.\nThe model knocked on the door and said to the man, “Look, you don’t know me, I don’t know you, we don’t know them, they don’t know us. Can I please bunk on your couch for a while?”\n“Sure,” he said – and went back to sleep.\nA little while later, the model woke him up and said, “Look, you don’t know me, I don’t know you, we don’t know them, they don’t know us – do you mind if I just sleep on the edge of the bed?”\n“Okay,” he said, and fell asleep again.\nA short while later, the model again woke him up and said, “Look, I don’t know you, you don’t know me, we don’t know them, they don’t know us, so what do you say we have a party?”\n“Look,” said the man, “if I don’t know you, you don’t know me, we don’t know them and they don’t know us – then who in hell are we gonna invite to the party?”\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"11106","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_wisdom_of_the_sands_vol_1/part8/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_wisdom_of_the_sands_vol_1/>The Wisdom of the Sands, Vol 1</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">8 There is no Ladder</h1><div class=post-meta>53 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;11106 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Wisdom_of_the_Sands_Vol_1/part8.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part7>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

POTENTIAL AND ABOUT THE ULTIMATE. BUT WHAT IS THE ‘LADDER’ IN BETWEEN?
WHAT IS THE PROCESS THAT HAPPENS IN BETWEEN? WHY DO YOU NOT TALK ABOUT
THE ‘LADDER’?</p><p><br></p><p>The ladder exists not. There is no ladder. There is no in between.
There is not any gap, it is all one. The earth and sky are not
disconnected. They are already joined together. They are in a deep
union, communion. The very idea of the ladder arises because we have
been taught that there is a gap between this world and the other. There
is none. It has not to be bridged. The other shore is in this shore. You
are not to go anywhere, you are not to do anything. The potential is
actual, and the first step is the last step. But the mind boggles down,
the mind cannot conceive it. Mind always wants to have steps,
ladders.</p><p><br></p><p>Mind can cope with a ladder, mind cannot cope with a quantum leap.
Mind can cope with evolution, mind cannot cope with revolution. That’s
why mind is never revolutionary; it is always orthodox, it is always
conventional. Mind cannot be revolutionary by its very nature.</p><p><br></p><p>You have been taught again and again that the body and soul are two,
that God and the world are two. And you have been taught that you have
to find God against the world, you have to go beyond the world to find
God.</p><p>I am giving you a totally new message you are not to go beyond, you
are to go within. The beyond is within, and the within is the beyond.
All is herenow. In this very moment the whole existence is present in
all its possibilities. It is only a shift of consciousness, not a
ladder. It is a change of gestalt, not a ladder. Nothing changes, all
remains the same – just a leap happens within you. Suddenly you start
seeing things which you were not seeing but they were already present;
they have always been present.</p><p><br></p><p>Have you looked in some gestalt psychology books? – there are
pictures. A famous picture is one picture where there is an old woman,
and also, hidden in the same lines, is a young woman. You can see the
old woman; if you go on looking and looking and looking, suddenly a
moment will come and the consciousness will shift to another gestalt and
you will start seeing the young woman. If you go on looking at the young
woman long enough, suddenly something will change and you will start
seeing the old woman again. When you have seen both and you know
perfectly well that both are there, even then you cannot see both
together. Because the old woman consists of the same lines, the young
woman also consists of the same lines, you can see only one at one time.
At another time you can see the other, but you cannot see both together,
simultaneously.</p><p><br></p><p>If you see the world, you cannot see God, that’s true – but God is
not opposite to the world, it is just another gestalt. If you see God
the world disappears. It doesn’t mean that you have transcended the
world. It is the same world, just your vision has made a new gestalt.
That’s why you will find it again and again, down the ages, Charavakara,
Epicurus, Karl Marx – all the materialists of the world say that only
matter exists, consciousness is a by-product, an epi-phenomenon.
Consciousness is illusory, the real thing is matter: this is one
gestalt. They are not wrong.</p><p><br></p><p>Then there is another tradition: Shankara, Vedantins, Berkeley, they
say the world exists not, only God is, only consciousness is. Matter is
illusory, MAYA. They are also not wrong; that is another gestalt – but
no one is absolutely true either.</p><p><br></p><p>The real man of understanding will say that God can be looked at as
the world, the world can be looked at as God.</p><p><br></p><p>William James is reported to have said, “Mind is one way in which the
world is assembled and things put together; matter is another” – just
ways of putting and assembling things together. Neither does matter
exist against mind, nor does mind exist against matter. You are body –
this is a gestalt; you are soul – that is another gestalt. There is no
ladder in between, because these are two gestalts.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember the picture again: is there a ladder between the old woman
and the young woman? There is no ladder because they consist of the same
lines. Nothing changes, the picture remains the same and you don’t go
anywhere... but a shift, a flick in consciousness. You see things in one
way, you assemble things in one way, then you see things in another way,
you assemble things in another way. Neither are materialists right,
absolutely right – they are not, they are partially true; nor are
Vedantins right – they are partially true. They both suffer from
partiality. That’s why their argument can continue forever, it will
never be decisive.</p><p><br></p><p>Just think of two persons arguing: “In this picture there is a young
woman”, and another man says “There is an old woman.” They can go on
arguing forever because they have partial truth, and it can never be
decisive. They will never be able to commune with each other, they will
never be able to</p><p>understand what the other is saying, because how can one who has seen
the young woman believe that the old woman exists there in the picture?
and vice versa. The materialist and the spiritualist go on arguing.</p><p><br></p><p>I am neither. I am simply saying to you that which is. Both exist,
but both are not separate. We call them two because we can see them in
two ways.</p><p><br></p><p>You ask me about the ladder – there is no ladder. I am not proposing
any gradual, slow progress for you here. That’s how you have lived for
many lives: thinking that gradually, gradually, slowly, slowly, you will
attain. If you see my point you attain right now!</p><p><br></p><p>But you are looking for a ladder.</p><p><br></p><p>Somebody has asked, “OSHO, THESE TALKS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE ON SUFISM,
BUT YOU ARE NOT SAYING ANYTHING ABOUT SUFISM. YOU ARE SAYING MANY
BEAUTIFUL THINGS BUT THEY ARE NOT SUFISM.”</p><p><br></p><p>I am not talking about Sufism, that is true. I talk Sufism, not ABOUT
Sufism! I am a Sufi, so whatsoever I say is Sufism. I am not giving you
steps to move to the beyond, I am simply making my own experience
available to you. I am simply sharing my being with you. This is not a
message, it is a sharing. It is not a teaching, it is imparting. Being
with me can reveal to you that nothing has to be achieved, that all
goals are false, that all is already achieved.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t want you to BECOME enlightened. I declare that you are
enlightened! But you are not courageous enough; you say, “How can I be
enlightened? I will have to wait. Some day I will become enlightened.”
You are so cowardly – that’s why you need time even to recognize your
Godhood. You have condemned yourself so much that you cannot conceive
that you can be a God. Because you cannot conceive that you can be a
God, you cannot conceive how Buddha can be a God, how Christ can be a
God.</p><p><br></p><p>When Christ declares “I am God”, he’s simply saying to you “You are
God. Look! I have the courage to declare. You also participate. See the
point. I am as much of the flesh as you are, I am as much the body as
you are.” There is nothing special about Christ; the only special thing
is his courage. Otherwise he is just like you. I am just like you; the
only thing is that I respect myself and you don’t respect yourself, I
love myself and you don’t love yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>You are also very suspicious. That’s why I call myself Bhagwan. There
are questions: “Why?” Because I am! And you are also, but you are not
courageous. This Buddhafield is being created so that you can gather
courage, so that you can become bold, so that you can say things as they
are and you can see things as they are.</p><p><br></p><p>I’m not supplying you with any ladder. You would like it very much,
because then you can postpone. I am simply saying to you, jump... and
be! Have a quantum leap!</p><p><br></p><p>There are not stations between you and God. The moment you are
concentrated in your courage, suddenly the gestalt changes – God is
revealed in millions of forms. And the moment you become God, the whole
existence becomes God. If somebody says “I am God and you are not God”,
then he is a cheat, he is a charlatan, he is playing a game, he is on an
ego-trip.</p><p>The second question:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2</p><p><br></p><p>SINCE RETURNING TO POONA TWO WEEKS AGO I FEEL MYSELF BECOMING
ATTACHED TO YOU. BEFORE, I NEVER GAVE MUCH THOUGHT TO HOW LONG YOU WOULD
REMAIN IN YOUR BODY AND NOW I AM WANTING YOU TO STAY A LONG TIME. I AM
THINKING OF YOU IN MY FUTURE AS I HAVE WITH SO MANY OF MY OTHER
ATTACHMENTS. I FEEL VERY STRONGLY THE DESIRE TO BE IN YOUR PHYSICAL
PRESENCE RATHER THAN FEEL YOU WITH ME IN THE WEST. IS THIS A STEP A
DISCIPLE GOES THROUGH IN COMING CLOSER TO A MASTER, OR IS SOMETHING
GOING WRONG THAT I NEED BE AWARE OF?</p><p><br></p><p>Sambodhi, to be attached to me is the beginning of disciplehood. And
this is not the kind of attachment that you have known before. Those
attachments were a kind of bondage. You were attached to your chains,
now you are becoming attached to freedom. To be attached to a Master is
to be in love, to fall in love with freedom.</p><p><br></p><p>A Master is one who makes freedom available to you. Be attached;
don’t be worried. Just because of the word don’t be deceived, don’t
think that you have known this attachment before. All those attachments
were just on the way: they come and they go, they are momentary. This
attachment will not go. You will go before this attachment. You will
disappear. This attachment is going to kill you, to destroy you, to
annihilate you. All those other attachments were not to annihilate you,
they were to strengthen you. You fall in love with a man or a woman and
you are attached, very much attached, because it enhances your ego. It
gives you a sense of significance – you are somebody. You are attached
to money because money enhances your ego. You are attached to power,
respect, respectability, knowledge, because all those things give you a
sense that you ARE.</p><p><br></p><p>To be attached to a Master is to commit suicide.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the right beginning, Sambodhi. Now you are really turning
into a disciple, and I know this is happening.</p><p><br></p><p>Sambodhi has come here accidentally. She has come because of Amitabh,
she has been in deep attachment with Amitabh. When Amitabh moved here,
she came. Amitabh became a sannyasin so she became a sannyasin. But she
was joined to me through Amitabh. Now, for the first time, I have seen
the glimpse in her eyes that she is approaching me directly. Hence, this
problem of attachment is arising. But this attachment is to something
vast, something enormous – you will be lost in it.</p><p><br></p><p>This is new, radically new, and fear will arise, and the mind may
rationalize that this is again an attachment. And the mind has never
been against other attachments, remember. The mind was never afraid of
other attachments, the mind was really always FOR attachments. Now, for
the first time, the mind will say, “What are you doing? You are getting
into attachment.” Now the mind will become a saint and sermonize to you
that “This is attachment. Don’t get into this attachment. Beware, you
are falling into a trap.”And this mind has never said this same thing to
you. In fact it was always taking you into deeper attachments. Mind
exists through attachments.</p><p><br></p><p>Now this is a totally different kind of attachment – mind is afraid.
The mind will say, “If you take this step, then this will be suicidal.”
The mind will create new rationalizations, philosophize.</p><p>Sambodhi, you say, “Since returning to Poona two weeks ago<span class=s4></span>” It is not only that you have become</p><p>aware. Two weeks ago when you came here and when I saw you for the
first time, I had seen your eyes: they are turning towards me for the
first time without Amitabh in between. This is a good sign. Now you have
REALLY become a sannyasin. Now the initiation is happening. The first
time it was so-so. I had initiated you because I knew the potential. I
had seen the potential, that sooner or later you would fall in love with
me, so for the time being, hang around. Any excuse would do – Amitabh is
a beautiful excuse.</p><p><br></p><p>And this will be helpful to Amitabh too, because he will be
unburdened. He wanted deeply that Sambodhi should be directly related to
me, not through him. He was feeling a little embarrassed. He w ill be
happy that the thing has happened.</p><p><br></p><p>Now don’t hesitate.</p><p><br></p><p>“SINCE RETURNING TO POONA TWO WEEKS AGO I FEEL MYSELF BECOMING
ATTACHED TO YOU. BEFORE I NEVER GAVE MUCH THOUGHT TO HOW LONG YOU WOULD
REMAIN IN YOUR BODY AND NOW I AM WANTING YOU TO STAY A LONG TIME.”</p><p><br></p><p>Disciplehood is born.</p><p><br></p><p>And the Master is not only his soul, he is his body too. And when you
come close to the Master, the first thing that starts changing you is
his body. You will be surprised to know this, I have never said it
before: his very matter starts changing your matter. His very matter
becomes contagious. Your soul will be changed later on, it cannot be
changed in the beginning. Things have to move from the outer towards the
inner, from the exterior towards the interior. First the temple has to
be changed, only then the deity. So there is naturally a deep attachment
with the Master’s body. It is not just accidental that many Master’s
bodies have been protected down the ages. In Tibet they have protected
ninety-nine bodies down the ages. The very matter, the very body where
enlightenment has been recognized and has happened, transforms its
quality. It vibrates in a new rhythm. To be close to it is to be
permeated by its vibration. To touch the body of the Master is to
partake of his body. That is why Jesus says, “Eat me, drink me.”</p><p><br></p><p>A Master has to be eaten, drunk. A Master has to be digested, chewed,
so he enters into the deepest matter of your being. The body is the
beginning and the beginning has to be transformed. Only a transformed
body will know a transformed being. Only in a different rhythm of the
body will you know God, because the gestalt will change.</p><p><br></p><p>So it is very natural that disciples become attached to the body of
their Master. Even when the Master is gone the body will be worshipped.
Just a hair of Mohammed is kept in Shrinagar, in a mosque – just a
single hair! – and it has tremendous effect on those who know how to be
in the presence of that single hair because that single hair has the
same vibe as Mohammed. It continues to vibrate in the same way. It
contains the subtlest message: the real Koran is contained in that
hair.</p><p><br></p><p>The tree under which Buddha became enlightened has been preserved for
twenty-five centuries, because the tree has a different vibe. No other
tree in the whole world has that vibe. It is unique, it has seen
something happening. When Buddha was transformed, naturally the tree
absorbed all those vibrations. It drank. Those vibrations penetrated
into the very fibers of the tree. The tree still</p><p>vibrates in the same way. Still, to sit under the Bodhi Tree is a
tremendous experience – but only if you know. If you are aware and alert
and in love with Buddha, then the secret of the tree will be revealed to
you.</p><p><br></p><p>Even while a Master is alive only those who are perceptive, feel; but
those who are really perceptive go on feeling even when the Master is
gone. Any small thing from the Master’s body – the room in which he
lived, the tree under which he became enlightened – has some quality,
something of the beyond.</p><p><br></p><p>Enlightenment is as contagious as any disease. And when a great
Master exists the disease starts taking epidemic proportions. You are
not here just to hear me, because that you can do by reading books, by
listening to the tapes. You are here to partake of my being, you are
here to partake of the matter that has become transformed with me. So it
is a natural desire, nothing wrong in it.</p><p><br></p><p>“BEFORE I NEVER GAVE MUCH THOUGHT TO HOW LONG YOU WOULD REMAIN.<span class=s4></span>”</p><p><br></p><p>You were not concerned with me, now you are concerned. You were not
involved with me, now you are involved. You were not committed to me,
now you are committed. Now somehow my destiny is going to be your
destiny too.</p><p><br></p><p>“NOW I AM WANTING YOU TO STAY A LONG TIME.”</p><p><br></p><p>If you need me<span class=s4></span>even if a single person needs
me I will be staying a long time. It will depend on</p><p>your need. How much you need me, that much I can stay. My own needs
are fulfilled, I can go any moment. There is nothing more left. All that
has to be done has been done and all that has to be experienced has been
experienced. I am fulfilled. This moment I am ready to go, or the next
moment any moment is perfectly okay now.</p><p><br></p><p>But if you need me, your very need will sustain me in the body. If
you desire me and my presence, if your thirst is strong enough, that can
keep me in the body. ONLY that can keep me. My own roots in the body are
no longer there. But your need, your desires, your longing, your search
for truth – if it is strong enough, big enough, it is possible for me to
stay long enough. It all depends on you.</p><p><br></p><p>So don’t be worried that you are falling into some wrong kind of
desire. This is absolutely natural.</p><p><br></p><p>“I FEEL VERY STRONGLY THE DESIRE TO BE IN YOUR PHYSICAL PRESENCE
RATHER THAN FEEL YOU WITH ME IN THE WEST.”</p><p><br></p><p>There is no problem; then just be here, Sambodhi. I am creating this
Buddhafield for all those who need to be with me, who want to be not
only spiritually connected with me but materially too. I am a material
spiritualist, or a spiritual hedonist. Any paradox will do to describe
me.</p><p><br></p><p>The third question:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 3</p><p><br></p><p>YOU SPOKE TODAY OF LOVE AND DEATH AND THE IMPORTANCE OF EXPERIENCING
LOVE TO PASS CONSCIOUSLY INTO DEATH. I HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED DEEP
LOVE,</p><p>ONLY SUPERFICIAL ATTACHMENTS. I DO NOT LOVE EVEN MYSELF SO HOW CAN I
LOVE ANOTHER? I KNOW THERE IS NOTHING I CAN DO REGARDING THIS IMPASSE AS
THERE IS A SEASON FOR ALL THINGS AND AT THE RIGHT TIME WHAT IS NEEDED
HAPPENS. IS THERE ANYTHING MORE I CAN DO THAN WAIT?</p><p>First, don’t console yourself. Consolation is not the way to real
understanding. It is true that there is nothing that you can do, but
this can be just a consolation, a kind of defeatism. Then it is untrue.
Even a truth can be used as a lie; it all depends on you. This is just
in your mind: “What can I do? So I have to wait.” But your waiting will
be impotent because it will be out of a kind of defeatism, out of a kind
of pessimism.</p><p>There is another kind of waiting which is not impotent, a waiting
which is aflame, a waiting which is passionate, a waiting which is
prayerful, a waiting which does not come as a consolation but comes as
an understanding.</p><p>What is understanding? Understanding is: “I cannot do on my own, but
God can do through me.” And any time is the right time, and any season
is the right season. There are not seasons when enlightenment happens,
just as it happens that in the spring all flowers bloom. If there were
seasons when enlightenment happened, then many people would have become
enlightened when Buddha became enlightened, then many people would have
become enlightened when I became enlightened. There are not seasons. As
far as enlightenment is concerned, it is always spring, it is always the
right season. But why is it not happening to you?</p><p>And I say waiting is the only thing that can be done – but remember,
it has to be a waiting full of prayer, full of longing, of a great
intensity; not impotent, not lethargic; waiting with a very, very active
energy, not just passivity. And these are two different kinds of
waitings.</p><p>When you wait for your beloved there is not passivity: you are all
aflame, you are full of energy. In fact you are never so full of energy
as when you are waiting for your beloved. You are all awareness. Just a
dead leaf moves in the wind on the road, and you rush, and you open the
door – “Maybe she has come?” A postman passes by and his footsteps are
heard, and you run – “Maybe she has come!” Everything, every sound,
becomes her sound. The wind comes and knocks on the door, and you run –
“So she has come!” It is not lethargy, you are not lying down on your
bed. You are very, very actively waiting.</p><p>My feeling is that the questioner is in a kind of defeatism,
pessimism, lethargy. If you are waiting in lethargy it will not happen.
Then no season is spring.</p><p>The energy has to be totally there, vibrating, pulsating, streaming –
and yet you are waiting, you are not doing anything. What can you do?
What can be done? Man as himself is tiny, but man can pray, man can cry
and weep.</p><p>Let your waiting be full of tears, let your waiting be full of
prayers. Let your waiting be not just passive but immensely, intensely
active. That is the doing that is needed. You will have to make the
distinction very clearly.</p><p>The real opposition is not between waiting and doing. The real
opposition is between active waiting and passive waiting. Active waiting
and passive waiting are the enemies. Doing and non-doing are not the
enemies.</p><p>You say, “YOU SPOKE TODAY OF LOVE AND DEATH AND THE IMPORTANCE OF
EXPERIENCING LOVE TO PASS CONSCIOUSLY INTO DEATH. I HAVE NEVER
EXPERIENCED DEEP LOVE – ONLY SUPERFICIAL ATTACHMENTS.”</p><p><br></p><p>The reason may be that because you called those attachments
superficial, that’s why you have not been able to experience deep love.
You condemned. To call anything superficial is to prevent yourself from
going deeply into it. Nobody wants to go into anything superficial. But
the word is significant. What does superficial mean? It simply means
that you are just touching the surface of it. If you go deep into it, it
will become deep. Every superficiality has a depth in it, otherwise it
would not be superficial either. The surface of the ocean is possible
only because the depth of the ocean is there. The surface contains the
depth and the depth cannot be there without the surface. Just see the
point.</p><p><br></p><p>Anything superficial can become deep, it depends on you; and anything
deep can remain superficial, that too depends on you. And people have
been taught to condemn all superficial things. That’s why they are
debarred from experiencing the depth of life. Everything is superficial.
You fall in love with a woman – this is superficial. You have a
friendship – that is superficial. You love flowers – that is
superficial, because flowers are momentary. And your religions go on
saying, “Search for the eternal. Don’t fall in love with the momentary.”
And the momentary contains the eternal! The moment is eternity. Because
the wave contains the ocean, if you condemn the wave you will never know
what the ocean is.</p><p><br></p><p>Drop condemnations. Forget all these words – superficial, momentary,
temporal, worldly – these are all dangerous words. Once you start using
them, once you get accustomed to them, you are prevented from every
depth. It is like you condemn the door: you say, “A door is a door. I am
in search of the temple.” But wherever you will go you will find the
door first, and then the temple. And you are against the door, so you go
on moving and you never reach any temple. The door belongs to the
temple. It is as divine as the deity within.</p><p><br></p><p>Learn to respect the momentary and soon the eternal will knock on
your doors. Love the superficial too! Love the physical too! Be
sensuous, be sexual. Don’t condemn, because these are the doors. Only
through these doors will you enter into something which is non-sexual,
non-sensuous. This is the mystery of life: that sensuality leads to
non-sensuality, sexuality leads to non-sexuality. The body leads into
soul, and the world becomes the door to the divine, to God.</p><p><br></p><p>“I HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED,” you say, “DEEP LOVE.”</p><p><br></p><p>How can you experience deep love? First, all that you experience you
call superficial. Second, you have not experienced deep love but you
must have some idea what a deep love is supposed to be – a perfectionist
ideal that deep love has to be ‘like this’. And you will never find it,
because in life everything is mixed. In life the sky and the earth are
mixed: you will never find pure sky and you will never find pure earth
either. You will be surprised to know that all the great religions
spread into the world by the same routes from where all great epidemics
spread; the same routes have been followed by religions too. The same
route that the plague spreads by is the route Christianity moves on. But
you cannot condemn just because the same route has been followed.</p><p><br></p><p>Everything is mixed in life. You have to learn that life has a
multiplicity in it, and you have to start decoding different things in
life. Decode the surface and you will reach to the profound depth.
Get</p><p>into the body and how long can you avoid the soul? People have great
ideas about love, how love should be; they have impossible ideals about
love. Then they cannot fulfill that ideal and they feel condemned.</p><p><br></p><p>Drop all ideals of love. You don’t know what love is! All that you
know you call superficial, and all that you don’t know you gather from
poets and philosophers – who may have gathered from other poets and from
other philosophers, and this goes on and on. You don’t know what
profound love is. You know the superficial. So it is perfectly good, for
the moment. Go into the superficial, go totally into it, and by going
totally into it you will come across the deep, the profound. And then
you will be surprised that it has NO connection with the ideals that
people are carrying. It is so indefinable that no definition has ever
been just and fair to it. And it is so mysterious that no explanation is
possible. It cannot be reduced to any theory. Accept the ordinary; the
extraordinary is hidden in it.</p><p><br></p><p>And your waiting seems to be just a dull, passive, dead waiting, a
kind of great lethargy. God will not happen, this is not the waiting for
God. Only death will happen. Out of this kind of waiting only death
happens, nothing else.</p><p><br></p><p>And don’t postpone, don’t play games. These are mind games. You say,
“I KNOW THERE IS NOTHING I CAN DO<span class=s4></span>”</p><p>How do you know? How do you know that nothing can be done? Have you
done ALL that can be done? Have you come to this point by your own
experience, that nothing can be done? Then you would not have asked the
question: “Is there anything more I can do than wait?” You are still
searching to do something. This is not your experience; there is still
some desire to do. There is something still groping in the dark, but you
are consoling yourself that “There is a season for all things and at the
right time what is needed happens.”</p><p><br></p><p>This is cliche. Drop it. You have heard it repeated too often, it has
entered into your mind. This is just consoling yourself. This
consolation will become poison. This is a way for the mind to postpone.
The mind never wants to get into anything – it only desires, it lives in
desiring. In fact if what it desires happens the mind is immediately
frustrated with it.</p><p><br></p><p>There is a beautiful poem of Rabindranath Tagore:</p><p><br></p><p>“I searched for God for many, many lives, and I saw Him always far
away, somewhere passing by the side of a star. And my longing became
greater and greater and greater, and I searched and searched. And I was
very happy in my search, immensely happy in my search. Then one day it
happened: I reached the house where God lived. I read the nameplate. I
was thrilled, I was all joy – so I have arrived! I was just going to
knock on the door, then the mind said,”Wait a minute. Think about it
twice. You may really find Him there. Then what? If He is really there,
then what will you do? How will you live? You live through desire for
Him, you live through desire. You are a seeker, a searcher; that is the
only way you know how to be. If you have found Him you will be stuck.
Then what will you do?’” And Rabindranath said, “I really became
frightened. All joy disappeared.” Yes, this was something very, very
important to be considered – “If I knock on the door and He opens the
door and embraces me, then what? Then where do I go from there? Then I
am stuck in His embrace And He may be beautiful, but that is the end of
me and my world and the ways that I have</p><p>always known, and it has been so beautiful searching and seeking.” He
says, “I took my shoes off my feet and carried them in my hands down the
staircase because I was afraid He might hear the noise, ‘Somebody is
there,’ and He might open without my knocking. Then I escaped, and I ran
as fast as I have ever run before. Since then I have been running from
Him, and I don’t look back. I have again started searching and again
started asking people ‘Where is God?’ And I again see Him sometimes,
somewhere there, far away in the stars. I start searching and I go on
searching, and all the time I know where He lives so I avoid that house.
I go everywhere else.”</p><p><br></p><p>Mind exists in desiring. And the best way to continue desire is to
lie down in a deep lethargy and wait for the right season to come. It
never comes – because the right season is always there. Only when you
are intensely aflame does it come; otherwise it is there. When you are
aflame, when you become spring, you are immediately in contact with the
spring which is eternally present. Don’t be lethargic.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard.…</p><p><br></p><p>The frogs who had been out on the tiles were suffering from a
terrific hangover. “Oh dear,” remarked one, “I wish we had some
aspirin.” At that moment a tortoise who had ambled by overheard his
remarks and said, “I say, you fellows, I will go down to the village and
get you some aspirin, if it will be of any help.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah, my dear fellow, would you really? That’s most kind of you to
offer,” replied the frog. And the tortoise started off.</p><p><br></p><p>Well after about two weeks there was no sign of any aspirin or the
return of the tortoise. So one frog said to the other, “I say, do you
think that tortoise can be relied upon? He has been gone an awfully long
time.”</p><p><br></p><p>At this remark the tortoise, who had been having a quiet rest behind
a boulder, said, “If you speak like that behind my back, I jolly well
won’t go and get that aspirin. So there!”</p><p><br></p><p>You can live in a kind of lethargy for ever and ever; nothing will
happen to you. And I am not saying that God does not happen to those who
wait. He happens only to those who wait! but waiting has a different
quality. Waiting has to be aflame, only then does God happen. Every
fiber of your being should be awake, alert: any moment it is going to
happen, how can you fall asleep?</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus is reported to have said again and again to his disciples, “Be
awake. Don’t fall asleep.” And he tells the parable where a Master told
his servants, “I am going on a pilgrimage but I may return any day, any
moment, day or night. You have to be awake for twenty-four hours because
I may come at any time, and I will come without informing you.”</p><p><br></p><p>This is the situation: the servants have to keep watch day and night.
They have to be alert, the Master can come at any moment.</p><p><br></p><p>God can come at any moment – you have to be alert, watchful. Your
waiting should be alert, watchful, intense. That is your doing. Waiting
is not against doing. Waiting is the highest kind of doing, the subtlest
kind of doing. Waiting is the greatest art of doing.</p><p>The fourth question:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 4</p><p><br></p><p>WHY IS IT SAID THAT LIFE IS STRANGER THAN FICTION?</p><p><br></p><p>Because life is! Fictions are only reflections of life; how can they
be stranger than life? Fictions are only parts of life. Life is a very
complicated whole: it does not begin, it does not end. Your fiction
starts and ends.</p><p><br></p><p>I know a person who always reads his novels from the middle. I asked
him, “What is the point?” He said, “This way you remain more in suspense
– the end is not known, the beginning is not known. If you start from
the beginning you are only curious about the end. I am curious in a
double way. I enjoy it more totally!”</p><p><br></p><p>Life is like that – it is always in the middle. You are always in the
middle, the beginning is not known. Religions have tried somehow to
supply the beginning. All those philosophies on how the world began are
just nonsense, because the world never began. It has always been in the
middle. That is the mystery, but the mind hankers for the beginning.</p><p><br></p><p>And then there are people who supply the answers. They say, “On a
certain day God created the world.” And what had He been doing before
that? Just sitting there stupidly? And how long had He been sitting?
Christians say, “God created the world EXACTLY four thousand and four
years before Jesus – on a certain Monday He started, and ended by
Saturday evening, and rested on Sunday.” Then what w as He doing before
that? – immense eternity! He must have got bored. In fact Eve must have
committed suicide or must have gone mad.</p><p><br></p><p>The world never began. How can there be a beginning to the total?
Because even if the beginning is conceived you will need a few things
before the beginning, and then it will not be the beginning. You will
need space. God says, “Let there be light!” But where? THERE IS needed.
Time will be needed. How can Monday start suddenly without time? It
needs a Sunday before it, otherwise how will you call it Monday? It will
be so absurd.</p><p><br></p><p>No, the world has no beginning and the world has no end. It simply
goes on and on and on, and everything is so complicated and everything
is so intertwined with everything else that nothing is separate. I am in
you, you are in me. You are in the trees, trees are in you. Rocks are in
you, you are in the rocks. The farthest corner – if there is any – is
connected to you. Touch a small pebble and you have touched the whole of
existence. Kiss a woman and you have kissed the totality, because that
woman is part of totality. When you kiss a woman you have kissed her
mother too, and the mother’s mother. You may not like it... but nothing
can be done about it – millions and millions of mothers-in-law, standing
in a queue behind your woman, from the very beginning. And you have also
kissed the child that is going to be born to the woman, and the
children’s children, and the whole future. Because the woman will go on
reverberating, she will live in the daughter, and the daughter’s
daughter, and she will go on living in millions of ways.</p><p><br></p><p>When you kiss a woman you have kissed the whole past and you have
also kissed the whole future. Touch reality anywhere and you touch the
total. And the total is so immense, immeasurable.</p><p>Life is very strange because it is a great mystery. I have heard
about a certain Doctor Smartass.</p><p>Once upon a time there were two young men who became close friends.
While sitting and talking at lunch one day, much to their surprise they
discovered that they were both in treatment with the same
psychotherapist, Doctor Smartass. As they compared notes, they agreed
that the doctor was competent and helpful. He was also maddeningly
composed and pompously sure of himself. If only there was some way to
shake him up, to make him feel as unsettled as he made them feel.</p><p><br></p><p>Gleefully they hit upon a scheme to unhorse the good doctor. Together
they made up an elaborate dream, rehearsing the telling of it until each
could present it as his own. That Monday would be the day of reckoning.
The first young man would go in for his appointment in the morning and
tell the therapist ‘his’ dream. His friend would repeat the performance
in his own session that same afternoon. Let’s see how Doctor Smartass
would handle that one.</p><p><br></p><p>On Monday the first young man went to his session and told his
carefully rehearsed dream. He hid his secret glee as he had the
therapist work on interpreting the dream. That afternoon, his friend
gave a brilliant straight-faced performance as he too recounted the
dream as if it were his own. Every detail of the second telling was the
same as the first.</p><p><br></p><p>He was delighted to see an uncharacteristic look of bewilderment come
across the therapist’s face. “God, that’s strange,” said the doctor.
“That’s the THIRD time today I have heard that exact same dream.”</p><p><br></p><p>Life IS strange. Things really happen here.</p><p><br></p><p>Life is unexplainable. All explanations fall short. All explanations
are stupid, silly. The real people who understand the mystery of life
don’t give you any explanation about it. They help you to experience the
mystery but they don’t de-mystify it. That’s where science and religion
depart from each other. The whole effort of science is to de-mystify
existence, to explain everything – and whenever a thing is explained the
wonder is lost. Then love becomes nothing but hormones, then falling in
love is nothing but chemistry. Then all that you do and all that happens
to you becomes very mundane, very ordinary, very superficial, not worth
doing really.</p><p><br></p><p>Just think... you are falling in love with a woman because of your
chemistry. Because certain chemicals are released in your body, certain
hormones are moving in your blood, that’s why you are feeling sexual,
attracted. If those hormones are taken out, if that chemistry is
changed, you would not feel attracted. All love will disappear. The
moment you think of the chemistry of love, love disappears. Then there
is only chemistry – two chemistries getting attracted to each other –
almost victims of chemistry. The joy, the gladness, the glory, the
splendor – all are gone.</p><p><br></p><p>The scientist tries to supply answers, although the scientist has
failed – but people have not yet heard about it. This century has seen
one of the greatest phenomena: the scientist has failed, UTTERLY failed!
– because the scientist has come closer and closer to truth, and the
closer the scientist comes to the truth the more bewildered he becomes.
The closer he comes to truth the more the truth seems to be more and
more mysterious, unknowable.</p><p>Albert Einstein said before he died, “The world to mc is now more
unknowable than it was when I started my work. I had started with the
idea that I would find a few explanations, I would make things better
explained, a little bit, but I would help to create a few explanations.
But all those explanations that existed in my youth are no longer there.
I am simply bewildered. I am dying not as a physicist but as a mystic.
And next time, if I am to come back, I would like to be born as a
plumber rather than as a physicist.”</p><p><br></p><p>A great statement... because the plumber knows more about the
mystery, lives it, enjoys it. By ‘plumber’ he means, “I would like to be
an ordinary person, a very ordinary person – a farmer, a gardener, a
plumber. I would not bother about de-mystifying existence. I would
rather live it, experience it. I would rather sing about it and dance
about it.”</p><p><br></p><p>Life IS strange, and that is the basic contribution of religion to
the world. Religion helps you to go into the mystery without
de-mystifying. That’s where theology goes wrong. Theology is NOT
religion. Theology is again the same endeavor as science – trying to
find explanations. Zen Masters are right when they laugh at your
questions, and Sufis are perfectly right when they answer your questions
in absurd ways. The answer does not relate to the question at all. If
you become puzzled, it is a great step. If you forget your knowledge, if
you unlearn your explanations, it is really a great step towards
God.</p><p><br></p><p>Live without explanation and you will live a religious life. The
fifth question:</p><p>Question 5</p><p><br></p><p>I FEEL A RAPPORT WITH YOUR WRITINGS – ALMOST LIKE A CONTEMPORARY.
SURELY THIS FEELING WILL CHANGE IF I BECOME A SANNYASIN. WILL THIS
CHANGE BE BENEFICIAL?</p><p><br></p><p>To feel en rapport with my writings is one thing, to feel en rapport
is totally another. To be convinced by my writings will not change you,
it will simply add to your knowledge. To fall en rapport with me will
destroy you, annihilate you, will transform you. When you are reading
you are the master, you own the book, and you can go on finding ways and
means to defend yourself against the book. And the book cannot do much;
you are free to interpret it in your own ways.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what you must be doing. That’s why you are saying, “I feel a
rapport with your writings – almost like a contemporary.” Your ego is
being fulfilled through them.</p><p><br></p><p>What is actually happening is you are not being convinced by what I
say, you are really convinced that whatsoever you have been thinking
before is right! – “Osho also agrees with me.” That’s what you think
falling en rapport is. It is not you getting into agreement with me, it
is me getting into agreement with you. And with a book, that you can do
very easily: you can forget those portions that don’t agree with you or
you can interpret them in such a way that they start appearing to be in
agreement with you. The book is dead. You can do anything to the
book.</p><p><br></p><p>I am alive. And I am SO contradictory. I relish contradictions. That
is my nourishment – that if you agree with me today, tomorrow I will
create trouble. If you agree with me again, next day I will create</p><p>trouble again. By and by you will relax and you will forget agreeing
with me: “What is the point? This man goes on contradicting himself
every day.”</p><p><br></p><p>This is a device so that you stop agreeing with me through the mind.
Then arises a different kind of agreement – a conversion – you start
agreeing with my being. That is true rapport.</p><p><br></p><p>Sannyas is nothing but a gesture from your side that you are ready to
go with me into the dark unknown, that you trust me, that now you are
ready not only to listen to my thoughts, you are ready to listen to my
silence too. The book can give you only the thoughts, it cannot give the
pauses in between. And they are really valuable, they are really
significant, not the words.</p><p><br></p><p>Looking into my eyes is more significant than reading my books.
Sitting close to me, feeling me, being overwhelmed by me, opening your
heart towards me – that is the real thing. The book has only one work to
do: it can bring you to me, that’s all. Then its work is finished. The
book is not the end, the book is just the beginning. Don’t get stuck
there.</p><p><br></p><p>You must be feeling very good; that’s why you say, “almost I feel
like a contemporary.” You are not! – because to be contemporary with me
you will have to exist in no-time, because I exist in no-time. I don’t
exist in the twentieth century. I am not a thinker. You can be
contemporary with Bertrand Russell. If you think in the same way, with
the same logic, with the same conclusions, you are contemporary with
Bertrand Russell – but to be contemporary with Buddha is a totally
different phenomenon. You will have to go deep into silence because
Buddha exists in silence, Buddha exists in no-time. He exists in
eternity. That’s why even TODAY you can become a contemporary with
Buddha, even today you can become a contemporary with Lao Tzu, and for
centuries to come you can at any time become contemporary with a Christ.
Whenever you transcend time you become contemporary with enlightened
people.</p><p><br></p><p>Just by agreeing with my thoughts you will not become my
contemporary. You will be contemporaneous to my thoughts, that’s all –
but not to me. And I am not a thought but an experience.</p><p><br></p><p>You ask me, “SURELY THIS FEELING WILL CHANGE IF I BECOME A
SANNYASIN.”</p><p><br></p><p>Surely. It is going to change, it has to change. You will feel
totally differently. The ego will start disappearing. It will hurt.</p><p><br></p><p>Becoming a sannyasin means you have become a disciple. Now you will
put your mind aside, now you will get more and more in tune with my
vibe. This in the East WE call SATSANGA: to be in the presence of the
Master, to see the Master, to touch the Master, to be touched by the
Master, to be seen by the Master. It is not a verbal communication.
Verbal communication has its own purpose. Because you cannot start
without verbal communication, that’s why I have to go on speaking. If I
had been totally silent here you would not be here. You are here because
I have spoken.</p><p><br></p><p>But if you remain here only just to hear me you miss the whole point.
Then you will gather only words; those words will turn dead in your
hands. Howsoever alive and warm they are when I release them, the moment
they get into your clutches they will be cold, dead stones. Unless you
become contemporaneous with my being... and that can happen only in
meditation. Meditation is the bridge between the Master and the
disciple.</p><p>You will change, surely you will change. But YOU HAVE to change! Are
you not yet bored with yourself? Only a dull person can remain happy in
the ordinary way, only an insensitive person can remain happy in an
ordinary way. A sensitive person, sooner or later, starts feeling, “I am
moving in a rut,” that “I am moving in a vicious circle.” The more
sensitive you are, the sooner you recognize that there is a need to be
transformed, radically transformed, that there is a need to go through a
revolution, that one needs a breakdown and a breakthrough.</p><p><br></p><p>The sixth question:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 6</p><p><br></p><p>I HAVE HEARD THAT AT THE TIME OF GIVING SANNYAS TO YOUR MOTHER, YOU
HAD STEPPED OFF YOUR CHAIR AND TOUCHED THE FEET OF YOUR MOTHER. THIS
UNIQUE SITUATION HAS THRILLED ME. PLEASE QUENCH MY DESIRE FOR KNOWING
SOME MORE. WHO IS GREATER – MOTHER OR GURU?</p><p><br></p><p>They are greater than each other.</p><p><br></p><p>Asking that question is wrong. The very formulation: it is just like
asking, “Which is greater – the hen or the egg?” You don’t understand.
You divide hen and egg; they are indivisible. The hen is a state of the
egg, the egg is a state of the hen.</p><p><br></p><p>To ask: Who is greater – mother or guru, mother or Master? is
possible only if you don’t understand what a mother is and what a Master
is. Both are to be respected for a certain thing that is common to both:
they both give birth. That’s why they are respected. The mother gives
birth to the physical being, the first birth is through the mother. The
second birth is through the Master. The Master is a mother! Becoming a
disciple means getting into the womb of the Master. A Buddhafield is a
womb. To enter into the womb of the Master, to enter into his milieu, to
become part of his energy – the second birth happens. You become a
twice-born, a DWIJA. This is what Jesus means when he says,,“Unless you
are born again.<span class=s4></span>”</p><p><br></p><p>A second birth is a must, otherwise you will live only as a physical
being. The mother has given you just the physical being. The temple has
been created by the mother, the deity has to be born yet through a
Master.</p><p><br></p><p>The English word ‘mother’ and the English word ‘matter’, both come
from the same root. They both come from the same Sanskrit root, MATHRA.
It is beautiful that mother and matter both come from the same root.
What does it mean?</p><p><br></p><p>The mother gives you matter, she supplies you with matter. The mother
is your matter, she is your body. The mother is the earth, the Master is
the sky. But remember, without the earth the sky cannot happen. Without
the temple the deity is not possible. So the mother has given you an
opportunity. but that is only an opportunity. You will have to find a
Master to transform the opportunity into a realization.</p><p><br></p><p>Now this is a problem: who is more respectable, who is greater?</p><p>Without the mother you would not be here, and the Master could not
work. Without the Master you would be here but your being here would be
pointless. In fact, respecting the mother and the Master are both for
the same reason – because they both give birth. Naturally, the higher
birth is given by the Master, so the Master is greater. But the
foundation is laid down by the mother, so the mother is greater. That’s
why I say they are greater than each other.</p><p><br></p><p>And you have asked, “I HAVE HEARD THAT AT THE TIME OF GIVING SANNYAS
TO YOUR MOTHER, YOU HAD STEPPED OFF YOUR CHAIR AND TOUCHED THE FEET OF
YOUR MOTHER. THIS UNIQUE SITUATION HAS THRILLED ME. PLEASE QUENCH MY
DESIRE FOR KNOWING SOME MORE.”</p><p><br></p><p>It is a strange phenomenon. Very rarely does it happen that a mother
comes to become a disciple of her own son. Mary never became a disciple
to Christ, and Christ was angry about it. He wanted, because he wanted
all that he had become to be shared with the mother. But the mother
never became a disciple; that’s why the strange statement. Jesus was
surrounded by a crowd and Mary came, and somebody in the crowd said...
the crowd was too much and she could not enter, and she wanted to have a
talk with Jesus... somebody said, “Your mother is waiting for you
outside the crowd. She wants to see you.” And Jesus said, “I have
nothing to do with that woman.” It looks ugly. Those words on Jesus’
lips don’t fit. But why does he say “I don’t have anything to do with
that woman”? She remained a woman. Jesus was angry, and his anger can be
understood. It is out of love that he was angry. He wanted his mother to
be transformed. He was sharing his light with strangers, and his own
mother and his own father would remain in darkness. He was sad about it.
His sadness showed in his anger.</p><p><br></p><p>When my mother came to be initiated by me, I touched her feet because
she proved to be a rare mother. To bow down to your own son is really
arduous and hard. It is almost impossible to touch the feet of your own
son – it needs great courage. It needs great risk to drop all your ego.
I touched her feet not because she is my mother, I touched her feet
because she dared! I touched her feet for the same reason, for the SAME
I say, that Jesus was angry. The reason is the same: I was immensely
happy. It is rare, happens only once in a while. And I touched her feet
also for another thing: because after that she would not be my mother
and I would not be her son. The account has to be closed as beautifully
as possible.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a drastic step. She had always thought about me as her son.
Now, no more. Now she would be my disciple and I would be her Master. Up
to then she had been giving advice to me, she had been directing me –
“Do this and don’t do that.” Now all that is not possible. Now I will be
directing her, I will be giving advice to her, I will be ordering her to
do this or that. The whole situation is going to be radically
changed.</p><p><br></p><p>She risked.</p><p><br></p><p>I respected her courage, I respected her egolessness. And the account
has to be closed beautifully: this was the last time I would be a son to
her; it will remain in her consciousness forever. Since that moment all
the ties have been broken. It was the beginning of a new relationship. I
touched her feet not only because she is my mother. I touched her feet
because she dared, she dared a lot. She dropped her ego.</p><p><br></p><p>And the last question:</p><p>Question 7</p><p><br></p><p>IT IS TRUE THAT IN A VERY CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WHEN ONE ‘PLAYS’ THE
GOOD, UNDERSTANDING, CALM AND RELAXED ONE, IT IS ONLY LEFT FOR THE OTHER
TO BE NERVOUS, TENSE AND ANGRY? PLEASE EXPLAIN.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, a certain kind of balancing always happens in relationship. If
one is playing very calm and quiet and cool, the other will have to do
all the work of being angry, nagging, miserable, fighting.</p><p><br></p><p>Just a few days ago Chaitanya Hari had asked a question, “Why did
Socrates continue to live with this naggy-daggy woman, Xanthippe?”</p><p><br></p><p>The question is relevant, because he is also living with a
naggy-daggy woman, Krishna. But remember, Socrates was responsible. He
was playing too cool, too philosophical. Xanthippe was not as bad as she
appears. If you go into the psychology of it, she was the victim of a
philosopher. She had to do all the work, the poor woman.</p><p><br></p><p>And so is the case with Krishna! Krishna was saying to me, “Osho, do
you think this Chaitanya Hari is a saint?” He is not! He only pretends!
Now Chaitanya Hari is also responsible if Krishna turns out to be a
Xanthippe. She alone will not be responsible.</p><p><br></p><p>There is a kind of balancing. Whenever two persons are together a
balancing happens. Don’t try to play cool, otherwise the other will have
to become more hot than needed. Don’t try to play like heaven, otherwise
the other will become hell. Be natural, be normal. It is sometimes good
to be angry and sometimes good to be sad, and sometimes to be hellish
and sometimes to be heavenly.</p><p><br></p><p>Then both remain natural, then both remain normal. A normal
relationship is a hell-heaven relationship. When one is – pretends to be
– heavenly or hellish, then the other is not left with anything else.
The only role left is to do the opposite. This has to be understood.
This is one of the greatest problems in the world.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard.…</p><p><br></p><p>Once Avicenna, an Arabian physician and philosopher, hearing of the
spiritual fame of Abel Hasan Khargani, visited the Master at his home in
Khargani. At the time the Master was absent from his home, having gone
to the nearby jungles to fetch firewood at the request of his wife. When
his wife was asked by Avicenna where the Master was, she replied hotly,
“Why do you wish to see that lunatic and imposter? What business have
you with him?” And she went on at length criticizing and belittling the
Master, and disparaging his spiritual status.</p><p><br></p><p>Avicenna was greatly perplexed. What she said contradicted what he
had previously heard, and he felt disinclined to continue his search for
him. However, seeing he had come so far just to see the Master, he
finally decided to do so. On going towards the jungle he was astounded
to see approaching him the Master returning from the jungle with a great
bundle of firewood loaded on the back of a tiger.</p><p><br></p><p>The philosopher, after paying respects, inquired of the Master the
meaning of and difference between what he had been told by the wife and
what he had seen with his own eyes.</p><p>The Master replied, “There is nothing amazing about it. It is a mere
question of labor. When I put up with and bear the load of suffering
from the wolf (read ‘wife’) in my house, then automatically this tiger
from the jungle carries my load for me.”</p><p><br></p><p>The Sufi Master is saying “There is a kind of balancing in existence
too.” Not only is there a balancing between Xanthippe and Socrates,
there is a balancing between this couple and existence too. Socrates was
immensely respected by people; disrespected by the wife, tortured by the
wife, but respected by the people.</p><p><br></p><p>This story is beautiful. Khargani is saying, “It is a mere question
of labor, there is nothing amazing about it. When I put up with and bear
the load of suffering from the wolf in my house, then automatically this
tiger from the jungle carries my load for me.”</p><p><br></p><p>Always remember, life can exist only in balance. It has always been
so. Good women always find bad husbands, and good husbands always find
bad women, bad wives. It is such that there is no exception to it. There
cannot be any exception to it.</p><p><br></p><p>One man went to Socrates and asked, “I would like to be married. I am
young. What do you suggest, because I have heard so many stories about
your married life? You are the most experienced person about marriage. I
have come for your advice. What should I do? Is it right to get married,
or is it good to remain a bachelor? Which is more blissful?”</p><p><br></p><p>Socrates said, “You better get married.” The young man said, “You
puzzle me.”</p><p>Socrates: “There is nothing to be puzzled about, it is simple. If you
get such a woman as I have got, you will become a great philosopher. I
have had to become! This is sheer necessity! Just to survive I have had
to become tranquil and meditative and silent. This has helped me
immensely. And if you get a good wife you will be happy, if you get a
bad wife you will become a philosopher. In both ways you will be
profited. Get married!”</p><p><br></p><p>But I cannot say that Socrates is not responsible in Xanthippe’s
behavior. And I cannot say that Sufi Master Abel Hasan Khargani is not
responsible in his wife’s behavior.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why in the East many seekers of truth have remained bachelors.
There is a reason for it. The reason is, the fundamental reason is – not
that you cannot attain to truth with a wife – because of compassion,
because if you become too meditative living with a wife, you will
destroy her being. She will start balancing, she will become ugly, she
will become negative. If you are all positivity she will become
negativity. Then you will be committing a crime against her, and you
will be responsible for it. Down the ages, in the East, seekers of truth
have remained bachelors. It is just out of compassion: why destroy
another human being?</p><p><br></p><p>Socrates was so silent, so meditative, so involved in his search for
truth: the wife simply felt neglected, ignored. She wanted his
attention. I can see it happening – pouring the kettle-bottle on him she
was simply asking for attention. He must have been too cold, so she was
making him a little hot. He must have been in a kind of dispassion, she
was trying to create some passion in him. If he could be angry, then he
could be loving too.</p><p>But he was not angry. He used it as a device: he became even more
calm and quiet. He allowed that hot water to burn his body, but he
remained a witness. Now this must have driven the wife more crazy. How
can you forgive such a husband who will not jump and hit you back? If he
had hit the wife back the wife would have become cooler.</p><p><br></p><p>If you are married it is better to remain normal. Your search for
truth should be interior. In your relationship with the wife or with the
husband you should remain a normal human being. Otherwise you will be
committing a crime, a sin: you will destroy the woman or the man. Then
meditate when you are alone. And sometimes if it is needed, be angry!
Just in play, act it, even if it is not needed, because once you have
decided to live with a woman or a man you have certain responsibilities
to fulfill. You have to be angry sometimes too – that is your
responsibility.</p><p><br></p><p>If Chaitanya Hari does not understand, then Krishna is going to
become a naggy-daggy woman, and half of the responsibility will be
his.</p><p><br></p><p>Now he sits silently and meditates upon music – and in the middle of
the night! Krishna jumps on him and beats him. No wife can tolerate
this, no woman can tolerate that she is there, alive, warm, full of
love, wants to be hugged, cared for, caressed – and you are sitting
there thinking of music? It can’t be allowed, it is too much. I have all
sympathy for Krishna. All that she wants is, “Come to bed. Hug me, be
with me. It is enough. The whole day you have been thinking about music
and meditation, there is a time to relax too.”</p><p><br></p><p>If one decides to be in a relationship one has to take care not to
destroy the other, not to throw the other to the polarity too much. Life
balances itself. If you are all positive the other becomes all negative.
So be fifty-fifty, negative-positive both, so the other also remains
fifty-fifty, negative-positive both. And when both are both, there is a
kind of beautiful relationship, a beauty arises. There is great music
and harmony. They become an orchestra.</p><p><br></p><p>If it is not happening it is better to be a bachelor, it is better to
be alone. At least you will not be disturbing any other human being.</p><p><br></p><p>The East is right: if you are a seeker after truth it is better to be
alone. And if you are already in a relationship and then the search for
truth has started, then at least you can act. There is no need to be
really angry, you can act and that will do. You can be hot sometimes. At
least you can show it – that much you owe to the other.</p><p><br></p><p>A story... Krishna and Chaitanya Hari have to meditate over it.</p><p><br></p><p>Wearied from the long drive, the model stopped at a motel, only to be
told that the last room had just been rented, but if she didn’t mind,
there was a couch in one room which she could use provided the male
occupant of the room had no objection.</p><p><br></p><p>The model knocked on the door and said to the man, “Look, you don’t
know me, I don’t know you, we don’t know them, they don’t know us. Can I
please bunk on your couch for a while?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sure,” he said – and went back to sleep.</p><p>A little while later, the model woke him up and said, “Look, you
don’t know me, I don’t know you, we don’t know them, they don’t know us
– do you mind if I just sleep on the edge of the bed?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay,” he said, and fell asleep again.</p><p><br></p><p>A short while later, the model again woke him up and said, “Look, I
don’t know you, you don’t know me, we don’t know them, they don’t know
us, so what do you say we have a party?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Look,” said the man, “if I don’t know you, you don’t know me, we
don’t know them and they don’t know us – then who in hell are we gonna
invite to the party?”</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part7>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

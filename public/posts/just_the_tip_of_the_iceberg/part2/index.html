It is for reference purposes only.]\n(Misery is simply missing the best of existence -- that's what Osho explained to us tonight.) Bliss is a bridge, misery is a wall. It is everyone's experience that whenever one feels miserable one does not want to relate with anybody; one wants to close one's doors and hide somewhere. Just the opposite happens when you are blissful. You cannot hide somewhere; you would like to run under the open sky, in the sun, on the beach, you would like to meet people, relate, share. This has always been the case.\nWhen Buddha was miserable as a king he renounced the kingdom, went into the forest and lived a lonely life, but when he became blissful he came back to the people. The same happened with Mahavira, he was also a king. He renounced his kingdom, went into loneliness and lived for twelve years without speaking a single word -- absolutely silent.\nNot to speak means to totally cut oneself off from others -- because language relates. It is because of language that there are human societies. Animals don't have any society, they all live a closed life because they cannot speak. Without language there is no society, no culture, no civilisation. To be silent means to cut oneself off from society. In a psychological way it is getting into one's loneliness absolutely, closing all the doors, all the windows.\nBut when Mahavira became enlightened, when his heart was full of bliss, overflowing, he went back to the people. For forty years continuously he spoke, related, shared his experience.\nBliss always helps you to be connected. And to be connected with people, with trees, with animals, with rivers, with mountains, is to be bridged with god because there is no god other than this universe. This universe is the manifest form of god, and if you relate and love the manifest form finally you will be able to enter into the unmanifest too.\nOnce you have seen flowers you will be able to see flowers in the seed too. In the seed they are unmanifest but they are there. So god exists with these two aspects. The visible aspect is the universe but to reach to the invisible aspect you have to go through the visible. Hence I don't teach renunciation.\nIf you renounce the manifest god, the visible god, the universe, you will never be able to relate with the invisible because the invisible exists as the centre and the visible as the circumference. The moment you run away from the circumference you are renouncing the centre too.\nYou have to penetrate into the circumference; you have to go so deeply into it that you reach the centre.\nHence my approach, my sannyas, is a way of bridging, a way of rejoicing, a way of bliss.\nBe blissful and god is not far away. When you are totally blissful, when not even a trace of misery is left inside you, when only god is, within, without, everywhere, whatsoever you see is god and the seer also is god, the seen and the seen, the known and the knower, all become one -- that experience of oneness with existence is the ultimate goal of sannyas.\n(Osho talked of true royalty not being something that one inherits but a fragrance that pervades the man of love.)\nBut down the ages we have been taught that the royal family is the noblest. And strange fictions have been created.\nIn England, in the Middle Ages, it was believed that the queen's legs -- because nobody had ever seen her legs and the way of dressing was such that you could\nnot see her feet -- were joined together... they 1/08/07 Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nweren't separate. And that was the most significant thing about nobility!\nBut this kind of fiction has been spread all over the world. These are invented nobilities: king or queen, or whomsoever he is, is just born like any animal -- but with a great potential. That potential has to be actualised.\nLife is an art. One has to go on learning more and more about it. And the best way to transform oneself into a noble spirit is love. Love is the very alchemy of transformation. But up to now religions have been teaching people to hate. They sermonize on love; in the churches, in the temples, in the mosques, they talk about love and they create hate.\nNow Christians have killed so many people down the ages and they still go on saying that god is love, that Jesus taught the way of love. All that Christians have done is nothing but murder people, burn people alive, for stupid reasons.\nHundreds of nuns were burned alive in the Middle Ages for the stupid reason that they were thought to be having intercourse with the devil. In fact the pope should have been burned because it was the priest and the whole strategy of the priests that created that state.\nIf a woman is continuously repressed, then naturally that repression starts bringing sexual dreams. Sex was thought to be the devil's work, so the idea of sex and the devil were associated. It was a perverted state of mind in which the poor woman started believing that because in her dreams she made love to the devil, she was corrupted. Not only that, you will be surprised to know that many nuns started believing that they had become pregnant. Their periods stopped -- mind has such power over the body -- and their stomachs started showing signs of pregnancy. It was all hot air -- nothing inside! But of course these were enough proofs.\nThey started walking like pregnant women and they themselves confessed before\nthe church that yes, they had made love with the devil in the night and that's why they were pregnant. They were burned alive!\nAnd the same has been the case with other religions; each religion has been destroying people of other religions. Christians killed Mohammedans, Mohammedans killed Christians, Mohammedans killed Hindus, Hindus have killed Mohammedans. It has been going on and on for thousands of years. It seems love is only a word. And mind is so cunning, it can even rationalize. It can say that to save our philosophy of love we have to fight, we have to destroy those who want to destroy our philosophy of love.\nAnd the Mohammedans were doing the same. The name of their religion is Islam; Islam means peace, and Mohammedans have been the most trouble -- creating people in the world. They have nothing to do with peace, they have created more turmoil than anybody else.\nHindus talk about tolerance, but my experience of living in India is that Hindus are the most intolerant people in the world. Even when they show tolerance their tolerance is egoistic, it is an insult. They are saying we are tolerant because we know that we are right and you are wrong; we can tolerate these stupid people, these foolish people. We have the truth and nobody else has the truth. We are spiritual and everybody else is materialist, so of course a spiritual person has to tolerate all kinds of people. But in their tolerance there is deep intolerance, in their tolerance there is ego and nothing else.\nThe very word 'tolerance' is ugly. Who are you to tolerate anybody else? One has to accept everybody the way they are, there is no question of tolerance. Tolerance shows hatred. It is not a good word, it is not a virtue.\nUp to now love has remained only a word and we have been brought up, poisoned, from the very beginning.\nMy effort here is to de-condition you so that all the heritage of the past which is ugly, inhuman, can be put aside and you can have a rebirth. And if one can be loving, there is no other religion needed, no other scripture, no god even is needed; love is enough, more than enough. It will open all the secrets. It is a small key but capable of opening all the doors, unlocking all the doors, all the mysteries of life.\nRemember it, only a loving soul is noble. And love has to be unconditional, non-\ndominating, non-possessive. Love has to be the sheer joy of sharing with no desire to get anything in return. Much comes but that is another matter; the desire should not be there. One should love for love's sake, because it is such a beautiful experience, it is such an ecstasy, that what more could one desire in return? It has intrinsic value.\nStefano means the crowned one. And the word Christ means the same thing.\nIt means one who has entered into the kingdom of God. It means one who has become victorious over himself. It means one who has attained mastery over the mind and is no longer a slave.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nIt is possible only through meditation because meditation means a journey towards your innermost being.\nThe world is tremendously beautiful but nothing compared to your interiority. There are beautiful flowers and stars and rainbows -- the world is really colorful, it is a gift of God. But still, it is nothing compared to the inner universe.\nThe moment one experiences the inner world, the outer world fades away. Seeing the inner, hearing the inner, one comes to know the real music, the real beauty. And that experience is a crowning experience because it takes you to the ultimate peak.\nA Sufi woman, Rabiya, was sitting under her roof in a small hut. It was morning and the sun was just rising and the birds were singing and it was a beautiful morning.\nAnother Sufi saint, Hassan, knocked on the doors of Rabiya's hut and said, \"Rabiya, what are you doing inside? Come out! God has blessed us with a beautiful morning.\"\nRabiya laughed and said, \"Hassan, it is better you come in. I know that the world is beautiful but I am enjoying the creator of the world inside. Creation is beautiful but it cannot be more beautiful than the creator.\"\nHassan was very much ashamed; he had never thought that his knocking on Rabiya's door would take such a turn. That is the beauty of the masters: they can turn a very ordinary thing into something extraordinary.\nHassan went in, bowed down to the woman, asked to be forgiven, and sat by her side with closed eyes.\nAnd that day he became enlightened.\nAnd Rabiya said, \"Now you tell me: where is real beauty, where is real joy, where is real poetry?\"\nHassan said, \"Now I know, the outer world was just like a dream, a reflection of the moon in the lake.\nNow I have seen the real moon, not the reflection. The outer was just an echo; now I have come to the source, the very source of the music. I have heard the inner melody. I am tremendously grateful to you.\"\nMeditate, and by meditation I mean become more aware of the workings of the mind.\nWatch. Observe.\nWitness without any judgment, because one can be a witness only if one is non- judgmental.\nYou are not to decide what is right and what is wrong, you just have to see whatsoever passes on the screen of the mind. And remember that you are only a witness; you have nothing to do with what is going on in the mind.\nAs this witnessing settles, less and less thoughts will pass, more and more gaps will come in. And those gaps will give you the experience which is the ultimate bliss, peace, silence. And when the gaps have become permanent you are no\nlonger at the mercy of the thoughts, a victim of thoughts. So you can put the traffic aside at any moment, you can stop the movement of thoughts at any moment and can become thoughtless -- you have come home.\nThat is the meaning of 'Christ'. And one becomes crowned because one is an emperor now.\nWhen Jesus was crucified the enemies were making fun of his name, Christ. They had put a crown of thorns on his head. They were simply poking fun at him, saying, \"Look, this is the crowned one, the Christ!\"\nBut they were utter fools; hence Christ prayed for them in the last moment of his life. He prayed to God:\n\"Forgive them for they know not what they are doing,\" because he was the crowned one. But the world has always behaved in that way with the crowned ones. The world has forced them to carry their own crosses.\nThe world does not forgive the crowned ones, it cannot, because in their presence it feels very much humiliated.\nSo every sannyasin has to be aware of the fact that there will be difficulties in the world. But don't be deterred by anything, because even if all is lost, nothing is lost. If you can know yourself you have known that which is worth knowing. If you can be yourself you have attained that which is worth attaining. All else is non-essential.\n(Meditation is witnessing the mind, or to put it another way for Dhyan Caterina, it is a state of no-mind, Osho explained.)\nMind is unawareness. Its functioning is unconscious, hence the moment you start becoming aware the mind starts melting. Awareness functions with the mind just as the sun functions with ice as the sun rises the ice starts melting. As you become aware, a certain heat is created in you and that heat dissolves the minds evaporates the mind.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nAnd Caterina means spotless purity. That is the ultimate outcome of awareness. Caterina also means beauty, grace, devotion. They are all by-products of awareness.\nThe beauty of the body is nothing much it is not even skin deep. The real beauty haq to be of the soul, it has to be of the inner. It has to be something not tethered to the physical because the body is going to die and with the body the beauty of the body will disappear.\nWe have to create a beauty that can transcend death -- and it is within our reach. All that is needed is the magic of awareness, the magic I call meditation. And when there is inner beauty there is grace; whatsoever you do, there is grace in it. You start having a golden touch, whatsoever you touch becomes golden. The mundane starts becoming the sacred, the ordinary starts becoming luminous, even darkness starts becoming light. And out of these experiences comes devotion.\nDevotion means a deep thankfulness towards god. He has given so much and we don't even deserve it; it has been showered on us and we are not worthy of it This experience creates devotion, prayer. And to attain devotion is the most precious thing in life.\nHow long will you be here?' he asked the Italian sannyasin. Only two or three days.\nCome back for a longer period. I am creating a little Italia here. Soon you will find all the intelligent Italians here!\nJust the Tip of the Iceberg Chapter #3\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2627","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/just_the_tip_of_the_iceberg/part2/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/just_the_tip_of_the_iceberg/>Just The Tip Of The Iceberg</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>13 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2627 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Just_The_Tip_Of_The_Iceberg/part2.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part1>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

everyone's experience that whenever one feels miserable one does not

universe is the manifest form of god, and if you relate and love the
manifest form finally you will be able to enter into the unmanifest

seed too. In the seed they are unmanifest but they are there. So god
exists with these two aspects. The visible aspect is the universe but to
reach to the invisible aspect you have to go through the visible. Hence
I don't teach renunciation.</p><p>If you renounce the manifest god, the visible god, the universe, you

proofs.</p><p>They started walking like pregnant women and they themselves
confessed before</p><p>the church that yes, they had made love with the devil in the night
and that's why they were pregnant. They were burned alive!</p><p>And the same has been the case with other religions; each religion
has been destroying people of other religions. Christians killed
Mohammedans, Mohammedans killed Christians, Mohammedans killed Hindus,
Hindus have killed Mohammedans. It has been going on and on for
thousands of years. It seems love is only a word. And mind is so
cunning, it can even rationalize. It can say that to save our philosophy
of love we have to fight, we have to destroy those who want to destroy
our philosophy of love.</p><p>And the Mohammedans were doing the same. The name of their religion
is Islam; Islam means peace, and Mohammedans have been the most trouble
-- creating people in the world. They have nothing to do with peace,
they have created more turmoil than anybody else.</p><p>Hindus talk about tolerance, but my experience of living in India is
that Hindus are the most intolerant people in the world. Even when they
show tolerance their tolerance is egoistic, it is an insult. They are
saying we are tolerant because we know that we are right and you are
wrong; we can tolerate these stupid people, these foolish people. We
have the truth and nobody else has the truth. We are spiritual and
everybody else is materialist, so of course a spiritual person has to
tolerate all kinds of people. But in their tolerance there is deep
intolerance, in their tolerance there is ego and nothing else.</p><p>The very word 'tolerance' is ugly. Who are you to tolerate anybody
else? One has to accept everybody the way they are, there is no question
of tolerance. Tolerance shows hatred. It is not a good word, it is not a
virtue.</p><p>Up to now love has remained only a word and we have been brought up,
poisoned, from the very beginning.</p><p>My effort here is to de-condition you so that all the heritage of the
past which is ugly, inhuman, can be put aside and you can have a
rebirth. And if one can be loving, there is no other religion needed, no
other scripture, no god even is needed; love is enough, more than
enough. It will open all the secrets. It is a small key but capable of
opening all the doors, unlocking all the doors, all the mysteries of
life.</p><p>Remember it, only a loving soul is noble. And love has to be
unconditional, non-</p><p>dominating, non-possessive. Love has to be the sheer joy of sharing
with no desire to get anything in return. Much comes but that is another
matter; the desire should not be there. One should love for love's sake,
because it is such a beautiful experience, it is such an ecstasy, that
what more could one desire in return? It has intrinsic value.</p><p>Stefano means the crowned one. And the word Christ means the same
thing.</p><p>It means one who has entered into the kingdom of God. It means one
who has become victorious over himself. It means one who has attained
mastery over the mind and is no longer a slave.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>It is possible only through meditation because meditation means a
journey towards your innermost being.</p><p>The world is tremendously beautiful but nothing compared to your
interiority. There are beautiful flowers and stars and rainbows -- the
world is really colorful, it is a gift of God. But still, it is nothing
compared to the inner universe.</p><p>The moment one experiences the inner world, the outer world fades
away. Seeing the inner, hearing the inner, one comes to know the real
music, the real beauty. And that experience is a crowning experience
because it takes you to the ultimate peak.</p><p>A Sufi woman, Rabiya, was sitting under her roof in a small hut. It
was morning and the sun was just rising and the birds were singing and
it was a beautiful morning.</p><p>Another Sufi saint, Hassan, knocked on the doors of Rabiya's hut and
said, "Rabiya, what are you doing inside? Come out! God has blessed us
with a beautiful morning."</p><p>Rabiya laughed and said, "Hassan, it is better you come in. I know
that the world is beautiful but I am enjoying the creator of the world
inside. Creation is beautiful but it cannot be more beautiful than the
creator."</p><p>Hassan was very much ashamed; he had never thought that his knocking
on Rabiya's door would take such a turn. That is the beauty of the
masters: they can turn a very ordinary thing into something
extraordinary.</p><p>Hassan went in, bowed down to the woman, asked to be forgiven, and
sat by her side with closed eyes.</p><p>And that day he became enlightened.</p><p>And Rabiya said, "Now you tell me: where is real beauty, where is
real joy, where is real poetry?"</p><p>Hassan said, "Now I know, the outer world was just like a dream, a
reflection of the moon in the lake.</p><p>Now I have seen the real moon, not the reflection. The outer was just
an echo; now I have come to the source, the very source of the music. I
have heard the inner melody. I am tremendously grateful to you."</p><p>Meditate, and by meditation I mean become more aware of the workings
of the mind.</p><p>Watch. Observe.</p><p>Witness without any judgment, because one can be a witness only if
one is non- judgmental.</p><p>You are not to decide what is right and what is wrong, you just have
to see whatsoever passes on the screen of the mind. And remember that
you are only a witness; you have nothing to do with what is going on in
the mind.</p><p>As this witnessing settles, less and less thoughts will pass, more
and more gaps will come in. And those gaps will give you the experience
which is the ultimate bliss, peace, silence. And when the gaps have
become permanent you are no</p><p>longer at the mercy of the thoughts, a victim of thoughts. So you can
put the traffic aside at any moment, you can stop the movement of
thoughts at any moment and can become thoughtless -- you have come
home.</p><p>That is the meaning of 'Christ'. And one becomes crowned because one
is an emperor now.</p><p>When Jesus was crucified the enemies were making fun of his name,
Christ. They had put a crown of thorns on his head. They were simply
poking fun at him, saying, "Look, this is the crowned one, the
Christ!"</p><p>But they were utter fools; hence Christ prayed for them in the last
moment of his life. He prayed to God:</p><p>"Forgive them for they know not what they are doing," because he was
the crowned one. But the world has always behaved in that way with the
crowned ones. The world has forced them to carry their own crosses.</p><p>The world does not forgive the crowned ones, it cannot, because in
their presence it feels very much humiliated.</p><p>So every sannyasin has to be aware of the fact that there will be
difficulties in the world. But don't be deterred by anything, because
even if all is lost, nothing is lost. If you can know yourself you have
known that which is worth knowing. If you can be yourself you have
attained that which is worth attaining. All else is non-essential.</p><p>(Meditation is witnessing the mind, or to put it another way for
Dhyan Caterina, it is a state of no-mind, Osho explained.)</p><p>Mind is unawareness. Its functioning is unconscious, hence the moment
you start becoming aware the mind starts melting. Awareness functions
with the mind just as the sun functions with ice as the sun rises the
ice starts melting. As you become aware, a certain heat is created in
you and that heat dissolves the minds evaporates the mind.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on

awareness. Caterina also means beauty, grace, devotion. They are all
by-products of awareness.</p><p>The beauty of the body is nothing much it is not even skin deep. The
real beauty haq to be of the soul, it has to be of the inner. It has to
be something not tethered to the physical because the body is going to
die and with the body the beauty of the body will disappear.</p><p>We have to create a beauty that can transcend death -- and it is
within our reach. All that is needed is the magic of awareness, the
magic I call meditation. And when there is inner beauty there is grace;
whatsoever you do, there is grace in it. You start having a golden
touch, whatsoever you touch becomes golden. The mundane starts becoming
the sacred, the ordinary starts becoming luminous, even darkness starts
becoming light. And out of these experiences comes devotion.</p><p>Devotion means a deep thankfulness towards god. He has given so much
and we don't even deserve it; it has been showered on us and we are not
worthy of it This experience creates devotion, prayer. And to attain
devotion is the most precious thing in life.</p><p>How long will you be here?' he asked the Italian sannyasin. Only two
or three days.</p><p>Come back for a longer period. I am creating a little Italia here.
Soon you will find all the intelligent Italians here!</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=just-the-tip-of-the-iceberg>Just the Tip of the Iceberg</h3><p>Chapter #3</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part1>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

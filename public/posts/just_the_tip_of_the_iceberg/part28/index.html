It is for reference purposes only.]\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThe truth is beyond the mind. All that is significant is beyond the mind. Mind is made of the stuff called dreams. Daydreams are known as thoughts, but they are not different; it is the same process -- it is non-substantial. Thoughts are like darkness, they appear just as darkness appears. It looks so real, but just bring the light in and it is no more there. It is an appearance, something very illusory.\nThat's why you cannot do anything directly with darkness: you cannot throw it out, you cannot bring it in. Absolutely nothing can be done directly to darkness because it does not exist in the first place. It has no weight -- it is just an absence of light. So when you bring the light in, because of its presence the absence disappears.\nThe same is true about mind: mind is an absence of meditation. The moment you enter into meditation, mind disappears just like darkness. And only then does one know that one has lived in a very illusory world.\nThe mind is the world in which we live. The real world is far away from us. The mind is between us and the real and it goes on distorting the real, interpreting the real, projecting itself on the real. It never allows you to see the reality, it never allows you to see even your own self. It becomes so important that you become focused on it, and the two realities, the outside and the inside, both disappear. The non-substantial becomes your whole life; it dominates you. You live through the mind, you live as the mind.\nAnd that's the only problem. To live in something illusory is to live in vain. There will be no growth, no maturity, no richness, no understanding, no bliss, no truth, no beauty.\nOne has to go beyond mind -- and that cannot be done by fighting. If you fight you have already accepted mind as real. The moment you accept the mind as real you are entrapped by it. If you fight with darkness, how can you win? Even Mohammed Ali will not be of any use if he starts wrestling with darkness! Darkness will destroy -- although it does not exist.\nWhen you fight with something illusory you are going to be the loser. You are fighting a losing battle.\nYou are simply wasting your time and energy, because there is nobody other than you -- you are fighting against yourself. It is as if you put both your hands against each other: you can make them clash, but that is unnecessarily wasting your energy. Both hands are yours. It is better to put your hands together in cooperation rather than in conflict. The energy is saved; one becomes a reservoir of energy.\nSo there is no need to fight the mind -- that is stupid. One only has to watch it, and watchfulness functions just like light. Watchfulness is light, awareness is light. It makes you more and more full of light.\nIt becomes a flame, and a flame without any smoke because it is without any fuel.\nHence all the mystics of the world have said the moment you enter your center\nyou know what real light is. They have all defined God as light, the ultimate experience as enlightenment. It simply means realization of the light, not as as object but as your very being, your very nature.\nSo the moment you become conscious, alert, aware, watchful of the mind, the mind starts disappearing.\nIn a perfect moment of watchfulness there is no mind to be found. And that is the beginning of a transcendental experience.\nThat is the meaning of your name, Veetmano: transcend the mind. Once mind is transcended the kingdom of God is yours. And with the mind all the problems disappear, all the doubts disappear, all hatred, all violence, all misery. Whatsoever you have known as your life up to now, the whole thing will simply disappear with the mind and you are born anew. It is a resurrection.\nSannyas means resurrection, the birth of a new being.\n(Religions in the past succeeded only in making man unwholey, Osho told us.) The old idea of all the religions of the world was to renounce, to reject, to condemn this world in order to praise the other world. They were creating an unnecessary opposition between this and that, between this shore and the further shore. And they are not in opposition at all. This shore and the further shore are in deep cooperation with each other. They help the same river to flow between them. They belong to the same river, they are not separate. Underneath the river they both are joined together; they are holding he river. If one shore disappears the river will die -- it needs both shores, both are absolutely needed. But they are not two, just two extremes of one energy, two polarities like positive and negative electricity. Both are needed for the electricity to exist, but they make one whole -- it is one phenomenon.\nMy approach towards life is that this world and the other world, the material world and the spiritual world are not opposites but complementaries. Without this, that cannot exist; without that, this cannot exist.\nReligions have created an unnecessary split, and the split has created a split in man himself. Man has 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nbecome schizophrenic, he is divided. If you go into the old scriptures of the world religions, they all talk of man in a way which divides him into the lower and the higher. Even the body is divided: below your navel is something lower, above the navel is something higher. This is sheer stupidity! It is the same body -\n- the same blood circulates. It is nowhere demarcated as higher and lower; there is no hierarchy in tile body. Even the head is not higher than the feet -- they are both together. It is one unity, one organic unity.\nAnd so is the case with the body and soul. They are not two separate phenomena. The body is the manifested part of the soul and the soul is the unmanifest part of the body The soul is the inner side of the same reality of which the body is the outer side, and they both function in deep harmony, in deep togetherness. It is tremendously beautiful how the soul and the body go together hand in hand, in a dance. It is one rhythm.\nBut religions created the idea that this world has to be renounced. The result was that religious people became escapists. They went to the monasteries and the mountains. In the first place they became afraid of love because love means the other, love means so e kind of relatedness; for that you need the world. So they were against love although they all talked about love. But their love was absolutely non-substantial, abstract. It meant nothing -- it was ghost-like. You can call it the Holy Ghost! But even if you call it holy it is a ghost, and a ghost is a ghost is a ghost! It does not exist -- holy or unholy does not make any difference.\nThey talked about love but they talked about love in such an abstract way that it really makes no sense.\nLove has to be earthly. Just as trees cannot grow without earth -- they need roots in the earth -- love needs roots in the earth; the body represents the earth. But the tree goes high into the sky; it whispers with the clouds. Every tree has an ambition to touch the stars!\nBut remember one secret: the higher the tree goes, the deeper go its roots; it is proportionate. The roots have to be as deep as the tree is high. The height and depth have to be absolutely balanced. With small roots the tree cannot go very\nnigh; it will fall down.\nThe old idea of love was abstract -- a tree without roots in the earth, just going higher and higher and touching the stars. It is nonsense! Yes, love has to rise above the earth but it cannot rise without the help of the earth. It needs the earth's support. Love has to become something higher than passion, but passion has to be its support. It is not against passion -- higher does not mean against. The higher contains the lower; it is bigger than the lower, not against. The lower is contained in it. The higher transforms even the quality of the lower; it beautifies it. It makes even passion transformed.\nThat is the meaning of the word \"compassion\": it is passion transformed, it is passion become luminous; then it is compassion. But it is not against passion. The flowers that come on the top of the trees are gifts from the earth although they look so different. Their colour, their fragrance, their beauty -- you cannot find them anywhere. If you dig in the earth you will not find the colours, the beauty, the fragrance, but the earth contains them. The tree simply helps the earth to reveal its secrets. Those flowers were contained in the earth, those colours are part of the earth, of the earth's chemistry. It is the earth's gift to the tree -- the earth is not against the tree.\nSo a real Buddha, a really awakened person, is a bridge between the two -- this world and that world --\nbetween the material and the spiritual.\nReligions created fear about love. Hence monks lived separate from nuns, nuns lived separate from monks. There was tremendous fear. One Catholic monastery still exists -- one thousand years old -- on Mount Athos. For one thousand years not even a single woman has entered the monastery. What to say about a woman? They don't allow even a six-month-old girl! What kind of people are living inside -- monks or monsters? They are even afraid of a six-month-old girl. They must be boiling! They must be sitting on volcanoes of sexuality. And they are not allowed to come out. Once a monk enters the monastery he has entered forever. It has an entrance but no exit.\nSo first those religions created these stupid people, devoid of love, devoid of the earth, devoid of roots; they are dead. And the second outcome was that they became uncreative, because without love there is no creativity, without the world\nthere is no creativity. And what can you create? -- you will be afraid of beauty.\nEven the beauty of a rose will remind you of the beauty of a woman or a man. Even the beauty of a sunrise will remind you, the beauty of the moon will remind you, and some faces will start arising in your memory.\nYou cannot paint, you cannot sing, you cannot play on musical instruments, you cannot create poetry --\nbecause without love, what poetry will you create?\nLove is the source of all creativity, and all the religions of the world creates people who were uncreative. That is a calamity. Millions of people who could have contributed immensely to the world, who would have made it a beautiful place, a paradise, were taken out, taken away.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nMy effort is to bring this whole nonsense to a stop, to a complete stop. It is time\n-- enough is enough!\nWe should create a new kind of religious person who knows how to love, who knows how to be creative.\nMy sannyasins have to do both. They have to be lovers, great lovers, and great creators -- whatsoever their inner feel, their inner intuition, is. But they have to be creators. They have to listen to their own possibilities, their own potential. And it speaks. hen you are silent your potential speaks to you, whispers to you. And those whisperings are absolutely categorical -- there are no ifs and butts. The heart knows nothing of ifs and buts, it simply says that this is your destiny: become painter or a poet or a sculptor or a dancer or a musician. It simply says to you that this is how you will be fulfilled. It starts directing you.\nThe function of the master is to help you to be silent so that you can hear your\nown inner whisperings, and then your life starts moving through an inner discipline. So I don't give you any outer discipline. I help you to discover your insight; then you are free, then you move in freedom.\nSo sannyas is not a bondage, it is not a cult, it is not a creed. It is a declaration of freedom. It is a declaration of individuality. It is a declaration of love and creativity.\nJust the Tip of the Iceberg Chapter #29\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2244","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/just_the_tip_of_the_iceberg/part28/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/just_the_tip_of_the_iceberg/>Just The Tip Of The Iceberg</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>11 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2244 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Just_The_Tip_Of_The_Iceberg/part28.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part27>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

Holy Ghost! But even if you call it holy it is a ghost, and a ghost is a
ghost is a ghost! It does not exist -- holy or unholy does not make any
difference.</p><p>They talked about love but they talked about love in such an abstract
way that it really makes no sense.</p><p>Love has to be earthly. Just as trees cannot grow without earth --
they need roots in the earth -- love needs roots in the earth; the body
represents the earth. But the tree goes high into the sky; it whispers
with the clouds. Every tree has an ambition to touch the stars!</p><p>But remember one secret: the higher the tree goes, the deeper go its
roots; it is proportionate. The roots have to be as deep as the tree is
high. The height and depth have to be absolutely balanced. With small
roots the tree cannot go very</p><p>nigh; it will fall down.</p><p>The old idea of love was abstract -- a tree without roots in the
earth, just going higher and higher and touching the stars. It is
nonsense! Yes, love has to rise above the earth but it cannot rise
without the <em>help</em> of the earth. It needs the earth's support.
Love has to become something higher than passion, but passion has to be
its support. It is not <em>against</em> passion -- higher does not mean
against. The higher contains the lower; it is bigger than the lower, not
against. The lower is contained in it. The higher transforms even the
quality of the lower; it beautifies it. It makes even passion
transformed.</p><p>That is the meaning of the word "compassion": it is passion
transformed, it is passion become luminous; then it is compassion. But
it is not against passion. The flowers that come on the top of the trees
are gifts from the earth although they look so different. Their colour,
their fragrance, their beauty -- you cannot find them anywhere. If you
dig in the earth you will not find the colours, the beauty, the
fragrance, but the earth contains them. The tree simply helps the earth
to reveal its secrets. Those flowers were contained in the earth, those
colours are part of the earth, of the earth's chemistry. It is the
earth's gift to the tree -- the earth is not against the tree.</p><p>So a real Buddha, a really awakened person, is a bridge between the
two -- this world and that world --</p><p>between the material and the spiritual.</p><p>Religions created fear about love. Hence monks lived separate from
nuns, nuns lived separate from monks. There was tremendous fear. One
Catholic monastery still exists -- one thousand years old -- on Mount
Athos. For one thousand years not even a single woman has entered the
monastery. What to say about a woman? They don't allow even a
six-month-old girl! What kind of people are living inside -- monks or
monsters? They are even afraid of a six-month-old girl. They must be
boiling! They must be sitting on volcanoes of sexuality. And they are
not allowed to come out. Once a monk enters the monastery he has entered
forever. It has an entrance but no exit.</p><p>So first those religions created these stupid people, devoid of love,
devoid of the earth, devoid of roots; they are dead. And the second
outcome was that they became uncreative, because without love there is
no creativity, without the world</p><p>there is no creativity. And what can you create? -- you will be
afraid of beauty.</p><p>Even the beauty of a rose will remind you of the beauty of a woman or
a man. Even the beauty of a sunrise will remind you, the beauty of the
moon will remind you, and some faces will start arising in your
memory.</p><p>You cannot paint, you cannot sing, you cannot play on musical
instruments, you cannot create poetry --</p><p>because without love, what poetry will you create?</p><p>Love is the source of all creativity, and all the religions of the
world creates people who were uncreative. That is a calamity. Millions
of people who could have contributed immensely to the world, who would
have made it a beautiful place, a paradise, were taken out, taken
away.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on

stop. It is time</p><p>-- enough is enough!</p><p>We should create a new kind of religious person who knows how to
love, who knows how to be creative.</p><p>My sannyasins have to do both. They have to be lovers, great lovers,
and great creators -- whatsoever their inner feel, their inner
intuition, is. But they have to be creators. They have to listen to
their own possibilities, their own potential. And it speaks. hen you are
silent your potential speaks to you, whispers to you. And those
whisperings are <em>absolutely</em> categorical -- there are no ifs and
butts. The heart knows nothing of ifs and buts, it simply says that this
is your destiny: become painter or a poet or a sculptor or a dancer or a
musician. It simply says to you that this is how you will be fulfilled.
It starts directing you.</p><p>The function of the master is to help you to be silent so that you
can hear your</p><p>own inner whisperings, and then your life starts moving through an
<em>inner</em> discipline. So I don't give you any outer discipline. I
help you to discover your insight; then you are free, then you move in
freedom.</p><p>So sannyas is not a bondage, it is not a cult, it is not a creed. It
is a declaration of freedom. It is a declaration of individuality. It is
a declaration of love and creativity.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:justify id=just-the-tip-of-the-iceberg>Just the Tip of the Iceberg</h3><p>Chapter #29</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part27>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

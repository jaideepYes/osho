This is one of the fundamentals of life which has not been told to people; on the contrary, people have been misled, because what has been told to them is impossible. They have been told to become pure first and then bliss will be the reward. That is utterly absurd because without bliss there is no possibility of purity.\nBliss is not a reward, it is an understanding. It is looking around and seeing the beauty of existence, the benediction of existence. It is simply feeling the joy of just being alive. Then each breath becomes something ecstatic.\nLife is a miracle. In fact there is no explanation for it, for why it should be. Neither the philosopher nor the theologian, nor even the scientist, has been able to explain why life should exist at all. And I don't think it is ever going to be explained; the mystery will remain. The mystery cannot be de-mystified, because it is not a question of knowing more; in fact life is something like a miracle. It should not exist but it does.\nWhat is the need of roses and lotuses and thousands of flowers? There seems to be no intrinsic necessity. If they were not there nothing would be missed. If we were not here the earth would go round and round the sun without missing us at\nall. Existence would continue the same way. The stars would be there and the moon would rise and the trees would grow and everything would be as it is. But life has happened --\nnot only life but consciousness, love. These are all miracles upon miracles.\nTo see this is to be blissful. Just seeing is blissful And the moment you start feeling and living this bliss you are purified, purified of all kinds of nonsense, superstitions, all kinds of ideas -- purified of the mind itself.\nAs one becomes blissful mind starts disappearing. To live in the mind is to know nothing or just to know the superficial, the non-essential. The moment you enter the world of bliss (Osho's hands, held together, fluttered and separated) mind has no function there; mind becomes utterly useless. When you are miserable the mind is needed, hence the mind clings to misery because they can exist only with each other. The moment misery is not there mind is also not there.\nIn a blissful state one lives in the moment, there is no past and no future; hence there is no possibility of having a mind. Mind means past and the projections for the future; and bliss means to be in the present, to be as utterly herenow as if you have never existed before, as if there is going to be no other moment again --\nthis is all. And then one comes to know that which is.\nOnce it is known)you are purified of all darkness. (His fingers interlocked and covered his heart.) Once it is known your life becomes virtuous. Then virtue is not to be cultivated, it is simply the fragrance arising 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nout of blissfulness, the fragrance of purity.\nOne can know it but one cannot express it, words are not adequate, words are very inadequate. Hence the need of disciplehood, the need for sannyas: it is simply a way to hear ordinary words with a new vision, with sympathy, with love. Sannyas means falling in tune with the master, becoming harmonious with\nthe master, then that which is lacking in words can also be transmitted.\nThe Zen people call it transmission of truth beyond words, beyond scriptures. Even when it is transmitted between the master and the disciple, the disciple comes to know of just the tip of the iceberg.\nBut that is more than enough to transform one. Then one can move on one's own journey. The master has triggered the process; then it is a chain phenomenon.\nTwo sailors were sitting on the beach. One was an old man and the other was a very young man. The young man had come for the first time to join up as a sailor. He told the old man \"This is the most water that I have ever seen in my life.\" The old man said \"You ain't seen nothin' yet. That's just the top of it!\"\nThe master can only show you just the top of it. But to see the top of it is enough. Then you can dive deep, then you can go into the infinite depths of existence.\nMy sannyas begins in bliss and ends in wisdom. Purity is just a small consequence of being blissful. So don't strive to be pure. Try to understand what has happened, what is happening every moment, and feel the bliss of it. And then you are in for a great surprise: purity, meditativeness, love, compassion, wisdom, enlightenment -- they all go on following slowly slowly. Just create one essential quality, blissfulness, then everything comes of its own accord.\nOne can be loyal out of fear but that is not true loyalty. That's what happens in the life of a soldier. He is loyal out of fear because if he is loyal he is rewarded; if he is not, he is punished, tortured. That's what people have known in the name of loyalty.\nThe sannyasin has a totally different quality of loyalty. It is nothing imposed on you, it is something that you are longing for. And it is not out of any fear and not for any reward; there is no motivation in it.\nOne simply enjoys trusting existence because doubting creates conflict, doubting creates darkness, doubting keeps your life split. Doubting never allows you to go with the flow of existence. You keep yourself aloof, you go on withholding yourself. You only go so far, and that too with great suspicion in your heart. Then you will miss everything because life is only for those who can be totally in it, who can live intensely and passionately.\nIt is possible only through trust. The untrusting one remains afraid, suspicious, on guard; the trusting one simply starts flowing with the river of life. And the river of life is going towards the ocean. There is no need to push it, it is already going there. We have to learn the art of let-go, then it will take you to the ocean, to the ultimate.\nMeditation is the most precious gift of God. It is so, because it is only through being meditative that one has the capacity, the sensitivity, to appreciate all the other gifts that one is given.\nLife is there, but you will never understand it as a gift without meditation. Love is there, beauty is there, joy is there, but they will all remain not understood without meditation. Hence meditation is the gift of gifts.\nAnd I teach only one thing: how to become meditative, because it is my experience that nothing else is needed for the inner transformation. No religious ritual, no more character, no outer discipline is going to help. In fact they all hinder because when you become focused on the outside you forget all about the inside.\nMeditation means a one-hundred-and-eighty degree turn. Ordinarily we are focused on the outside; in meditation we change the focus. We are focused on ourselves. Meditation means the experience of your own interiority; it is an inward journey.\nAnd once you have tasted even a single drop of the nectar then the misery, the anguish, the whole problematic life dissolves. Now you know the right direction in which to go; now you know the right door at which to knock.…\nJesus says, \"Knock and the door shall be opened unto you.\" But the question is on what door, where to knock? Knocking on just any door is not going to help. Unless you start knocking on the inner door nothing is going to happen.\nJesus says, \"Ask and it shall be given.\" But whom to ask? People have been asking the sky, the heavens, God the Father, somewhere above there in the clouds. For centuries they have been asking and nothing has been answered. One has to ask one's own inner core.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nJesus says, \"Seek and ye shall find.\" But where to seek? People have been seeking in every sacred place; they are going to Jerusalem or to Mecca or to Kashi or to Tibet. That is not going to help. Wherever you go, you are wasting your time. One has to go within. The kingdom of God is within you.\nMeditation is the whole art of transforming the gestalt; the consciousness that goes outwards starts turning in. And then one becomes aware of millions of gifts; then small things, very small and ordinary things, have tremendous significance. Just a dewdrop slipping from the lotus leaf into the lake is enough to fill one with wonder and awe. It is poetry, pure poetry! It is music, it is dance, it is a finger pointing to the moon.\nThis is how you have to slip into the lake of consciousness, just like a dewdrop. It can become the moment of sudden enlightenment.\n(Osho explained why he had retained Yoh Hiroshi's name.)\nIt is very pregnant with meaning. Yoh means yin-yang. That is the whole philosophy of tao.\nExistence is made of two energies. On the surface they are polar opposites; deep down they are not opposites but complementaries. One can call them yin-yang or negative-positive or Shiva and Shakti or male and female. In fact yin and yang imply all possible opposites, with the underlying meaning that opposites are not opposites but complementaries.\nThe moment it happens that the opposites meet within you, that yin becomes yang, yang becomes yin, that the male and female inside you meet and merge into one -- or in modern psychological jargon the conscious and unconscious meet and merge into one -- for the first time you experience your organic wholeness. And that is the meaning of Hiroshi; Hiroshi means vastness, oceanic vastness.\nYin and yang divided, we are very small; yin and yang together and we contain\nthe whole universe. The art of meditation is to help the man and the woman within you meet and merge and become one.\nWhen man meets even with his outer woman, for a single moment a different quality comes to his being.\nJust for a split moment when you are at the climax of your orgasmic joy, when you are not separate from the woman and the woman is not separate from you, then you are not there, she is not there; suddenly a duality has disappeared and in that disappearance of duality you have the first glimpse of what unity can be.\nThe ultimate secrets of meditation have been discovered through this orgasmic joy. The whole tradition of Tantra is a proof of it. But the meeting with the outer woman or outer man can only be momentary. The same can happen inside you.\nOne of the greatest contributions of Carl Gustav Jung to modern psychology is that he accepted this ancient taoist idea that inside man has both the male part and the female part. And the same is the case with the woman, she has both. But they are separate; a very subtle wall keeps them separate inside you. The wall is really subtle. It is just like a Japanese paper curtain, it can easily be removed. And once it is removed the whole is experienced.\nTo remain clinging to the part is misery, to allow the whole to happen is bliss.\nTrue religion has nothing to do with Christianity, Hinduism, Buddhism. It certainly has something to do with Christ, Krishna and Buddha. True religion has been experienced only by very few people in the world; others have simply followed borrowed knowledge.\nMy effort here is not to make a Buddhist out of you but a Buddha. Less than that is meaningless. One should not settle for anything less. If you can be a Buddha, why be a Buddhist? If you can be a Christ, why be a Christian? Leave it for the cowards to be Christians and Buddhists and Hindus and Mohammedans. The brave one, the courageous one, would like to know the truth on his own.\n(Osho's eyes were wide open, his eyebrows arched for emphasis.) He would not like to know the truth through others, he would like to experience it himself -- because unless you drink the water your thirst is not going to be quenched. Buddha may have drunk the whole Ganges -- that is not going to make any difference to you. Just a glass of water will do for you but you have to drink it.\nBut people are so foolish that they go on worshipping Buddha and Krishna and Christ, and hoping that their thirst will be quenched they go on worshipping scriptures -- Dhammapada, Koran, Bible. It is like a thirsty man worshipping a book of chemistry which explain that water is H2O. You can go on worshipping the book; you will remain thirsty. You are simply proving yourself silly and nothing else.\nOr you can go on repeating the mantra \"H2O, H2O, H2O...\", \" buddham sharanam gachchhami, buddham sharanam gachchhami, buddham sharanam gachchami\". It is not going to help, it is just H2O --\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nyou have to drink it yourself.\nThat is the whole significance of sannyas, I am not creating any religion, I am simply imparting to you a glimpse into true religion and helping you to know it on your own.\nTruth liberates but it has to be your own experience, only then does it liberate, otherwise it creates a great bondage.\n(Osho cautioned the Japanese woman who followed, that not all that goes under the name of meditation is really meditation; in fact some so-called meditation methods are positive hindrances.) All methods of concentration are against meditativeness. All that is known as contemplation is not meditation at all.\nThese three words (Osho marked them off on his fingers) have to be understood well: concentration, contemplation and meditation.\nConcentration means focussing the mind on one subject, on one object, not allowing the mind to roam here and there, forcing it, excluding everything else except the object on which you want to concentrate.\nOf course many distractions will arise and many times you will go on missing the thread because you are doing something unnatural.\nMind's very nature is movement and you are trying to force it to remain still, at one point. It cannot do it, and if you manage to do it after long, long practice, then it will be very tiring and exhausting. It won't make you blissful, it will make you very mad. It will give you a long saintlike face. It will make you a saint but not a meditator; it will make you dead but not alive.\nGoing against nature never helps. One can be victorious only with nature and through nature. There is no victory against nature; maybe there are momentary victories, but one should not rejoice in those momentary victories. They are insignificant and the price that we have to pay for them is immense. Time is wasted, energy is wasted and the ultimate result is zero.\nContemplation is a little more liquid, a little more fluid than concentration. In concentration you have to remain fixed on one word or one object -- for example, the word \"love\". In concentration you have to remain fixed on these four letters of love; in contemplation you can roam around, going into many meanings of love, you can go deep or high, you can bring in many other ideas concerning love. Of course there is a limit but you have a longer rope than in concentration.\nSo in contemplation one feels a little bit more free but one is still tethered. You cannot go out of the subject of love. Everything else is excluded. You cannot think about freedom or truth, you cannot think about anything else except love. But one can think much about love, one can ponder over it for hours or for days because love itself is an oceanic experience. It is less tiring than concentration, more fulfilling than concentration, but it is still not the real thing.\nThe real thing is meditation. In meditation you are neither concentrating on anything nor contemplating anything; you are simply open and available to all that is. The distant call of the cuckoo, a dog starts barking, a child starts crying -- all is included. The train passes by, the traffic noise . somebody is playing on a flute, the horn of the car . the neighbours start shouting, fighting -- everything is included. You are just a witness, watching everything without any judgement, neither condemning nor appreciating.\nThis non-judgemental awareness is what I mean by meditation. It is inclusive of\nall, it excludes nothing.\nIt is pure openness, vulnerability. All the windows, all the doors are open; everything is welcome, everything is just a guest and you are a host. Many guests come and many guests go but the host remains and abides.\nSlowly slowly one becomes aware that everything comes and goes but one is always herenow. This experience, that you are always herenow, gives you the first feel of eternity, of the deathless, of the immortal truth.\nJust the Tip of the Iceberg Chapter #2 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"3021","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/just_the_tip_of_the_iceberg/part1/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/just_the_tip_of_the_iceberg/>Just The Tip Of The Iceberg</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>15 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;3021 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Just_The_Tip_Of_The_Iceberg/part1.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=_index>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

words are very inadequate. Hence the need of disciplehood, the need for
sannyas: it is simply a way to hear ordinary words with a new vision,
with sympathy, with love. Sannyas means falling in tune with the master,
becoming harmonious with</p><p>the master, then that which is lacking in words can also be
transmitted.</p><p>The Zen people call it transmission of truth beyond words, beyond
scriptures. Even when it is transmitted between the master and the
disciple, the disciple comes to know of just the tip of the iceberg.</p><p>But that is more than enough to transform one. Then one can move on
one's own journey. The master has triggered the process; then it is a
chain phenomenon.</p><p>Two sailors were sitting on the beach. One was an old man and the
other was a very young man. The young man had come for the first time to
join up as a sailor. He told the old man "This is the most water that I
have ever seen in my life." The old man said "You ain't seen nothin'
yet. That's just the top of it!"</p><p>The master can only show you just the top of it. But to see the top
of it is enough. Then you can dive deep, then you can go into the
infinite depths of existence.</p><p>My sannyas begins in bliss and ends in wisdom. Purity is just a small
consequence of being blissful. So don't strive to be pure. Try to
understand what has happened, what is happening every moment, and feel
the bliss of it. And then you are in for a great surprise: purity,
meditativeness, love, compassion, wisdom, enlightenment -- they all go
on following slowly slowly. Just create one essential quality,
blissfulness, then everything comes of its own accord.</p><p>One can be loyal out of fear but that is not true loyalty. That's
what happens in the life of a soldier. He is loyal out of fear because
if he is loyal he is rewarded; if he is not, he is punished, tortured.
That's what people have known in the name of loyalty.</p><p>The sannyasin has a totally different quality of loyalty. It is
nothing imposed on you, it is something that you are longing for. And it
is not out of any fear and not for any reward; there is no motivation in
it.</p><p>One simply enjoys trusting existence because doubting creates
conflict, doubting creates darkness, doubting keeps your life split.
Doubting never allows you to go with the flow of existence. You keep
yourself aloof, you go on withholding yourself. You only go so far, and
that too with great suspicion in your heart. Then you will miss
everything because life is only for those who can be totally in it, who
can live intensely and passionately.</p><p>It is possible only through trust. The untrusting one remains afraid,
suspicious, on guard; the trusting one simply starts flowing with the
river of life. And the river of life is going towards the ocean. There
is no need to push it, it is already going there. We have to learn the
art of let-go, then it will take you to the ocean, to the ultimate.</p><p>Meditation is the most precious gift of God. It is so, because it is
only through being meditative that one has the capacity, the
sensitivity, to appreciate all the other gifts that one is given.</p><p>Life is there, but you will never understand it as a gift without
meditation. Love is there, beauty is there, joy is there, but they will
all remain not understood without meditation. Hence meditation is the
gift of gifts.</p><p>And I teach only one thing: how to become meditative, because it is
my experience that nothing else is needed for the inner transformation.
No religious ritual, no more character, no outer discipline is going to
help. In fact they all hinder because when you become focused on the
outside you forget all about the inside.</p><p>Meditation means a one-hundred-and-eighty degree turn. Ordinarily we
are focused on the outside; in meditation we change the focus. We are
focused on ourselves. Meditation means the experience of your own
interiority; it is an inward journey.</p><p>And once you have tasted even a single drop of the nectar then the
misery, the anguish, the whole problematic life dissolves. Now you know
the right direction in which to go; now you know the right door at which
to knock.…</p><p>Jesus says, "Knock and the door shall be opened unto you." But the
question is on what door, where to knock? Knocking on just any door is
not going to help. Unless you start knocking on the inner door nothing
is going to happen.</p><p>Jesus says, "Ask and it shall be given." But whom to ask? People have
been asking the sky, the heavens, God the Father, somewhere above there
in the clouds. For centuries they have been asking and nothing has been
answered. One has to ask one's own inner core.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>Jesus says, "Seek and ye shall find." But where to seek? People have
been seeking in every sacred place; they are going to Jerusalem or to
Mecca or to Kashi or to Tibet. That is not going to help. Wherever you
go, you are wasting your time. One has to go within. The kingdom of God
is within you.</p><p>Meditation is the whole art of transforming the gestalt; the
consciousness that goes outwards starts turning in. And then one becomes
aware of millions of gifts; then small things, very small and ordinary
things, have tremendous significance. Just a dewdrop slipping from the
lotus leaf into the lake is enough to fill one with wonder and awe. It
is poetry, pure poetry! It is music, it is dance, it is a finger
pointing to the moon.</p><p>This is how you have to slip into the lake of consciousness, just
like a dewdrop. It can become the moment of sudden enlightenment.</p><p>(Osho explained why he had retained Yoh Hiroshi's name.)</p><p>It is very pregnant with meaning. Yoh means yin-yang. That is the
whole philosophy of tao.</p><p>Existence is made of two energies. On the surface they are polar
opposites; deep down they are not opposites but complementaries. One can
call them yin-yang or negative-positive or Shiva and Shakti or male and
female. In fact yin and yang imply <em>all</em> possible opposites, with
the underlying meaning that opposites are not opposites but
complementaries.</p><p>The moment it happens that the opposites meet within you, that yin
becomes yang, yang becomes yin, that the male and female inside you meet
and merge into one -- or in modern psychological jargon the conscious
and unconscious meet and merge into one -- for the first time you
experience your organic wholeness. And that is the meaning of Hiroshi;
Hiroshi means vastness, oceanic vastness.</p><p>Yin and yang divided, we are very small; yin and yang together and we
contain</p><p>the whole universe. The art of meditation is to help the man and the
woman within you meet and merge and become one.</p><p>When man meets even with his outer woman, for a single moment a
different quality comes to his being.</p><p>Just for a split moment when you are at the climax of your orgasmic
joy, when you are not separate from the woman and the woman is not
separate from you, then you are not there, she is not there; suddenly a
duality has disappeared and in that disappearance of duality you have
the first glimpse of what unity can be.</p><p>The ultimate secrets of meditation have been discovered through this
orgasmic joy. The whole tradition of Tantra is a proof of it. But the
meeting with the outer woman or outer man can only be momentary. The
same can happen inside you.</p><p>One of the greatest contributions of Carl Gustav Jung to modern
psychology is that he accepted this ancient taoist idea that inside man
has both the male part and the female part. And the same is the case
with the woman, she has both. But they are separate; a very subtle wall
keeps them separate inside you. The wall is really subtle. It is just
like a Japanese paper curtain, it can easily be removed. And once it is
removed the whole is experienced.</p><p>To remain clinging to the part is misery, to allow the whole to
happen is bliss.</p><p>True religion has nothing to do with Christianity, Hinduism,
Buddhism. It certainly has something to do with Christ, Krishna and
Buddha. True religion has been experienced only by very few people in
the world; others have simply followed borrowed knowledge.</p><p>My effort here is not to make a Buddhist out of you but a Buddha.
Less than that is meaningless. One should not settle for anything less.
If you can be a Buddha, why be a Buddhist? If you can be a Christ, why
be a Christian? Leave it for the cowards to be Christians and Buddhists
and Hindus and Mohammedans. The brave one, the courageous one, would
like to know the truth on his <em>own</em>.</p><p>(Osho's eyes were wide open, his eyebrows arched for emphasis.) He
would not like to know the truth through others, he would like to
experience it himself -- because unless <em>you</em> drink the water
your thirst is not going to be quenched. Buddha may have drunk the whole
Ganges -- that is not going to make any difference to you. Just a glass
of water will do for you but <em>you</em> have to drink it.</p><p>But people are so foolish that they go on worshipping Buddha and
Krishna and Christ, and hoping that their thirst will be quenched they
go on worshipping scriptures -- Dhammapada, Koran, Bible. It is like a
thirsty man worshipping a book of chemistry which explain that water is
H2O. You can go on worshipping the book; you will remain thirsty. You
are simply proving yourself silly and nothing else.</p><p>Or you can go on repeating the mantra "H2O, H2O, H2O...", "
<em>buddham sharanam gachchhami, buddham sharanam gachchhami, buddham
sharanam gachchami</em>". It is not going to help, it is just H2O --</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on

religion, I am simply imparting to you a glimpse into true religion and
helping you to know it on your own.</p><p>Truth liberates but it has to be your own experience, only then does
it liberate, otherwise it creates a great bondage.</p><p>(Osho cautioned the Japanese woman who followed, that not all that
goes under the name of meditation is really meditation; in fact some
so-called meditation methods are positive hindrances.) All methods of
concentration are against meditativeness. All that is known as
contemplation is not meditation at all.</p><p>These three words (Osho marked them off on his fingers) have to be
understood well: concentration, contemplation and meditation.</p><p>Concentration means focussing the mind on one subject, on one object,
not allowing the mind to roam here and there, forcing it, excluding
everything else except the object on which you want to concentrate.</p><p>Of course many distractions will arise and many times you will go on
missing the thread because you are doing something unnatural.</p><p>Mind's very nature is movement and you are trying to force it to
remain still, at one point. It cannot do it, and if you manage to do it
after long, long practice, then it will be very tiring and exhausting.
It won't make you blissful, it will make you very mad. It will give you
a long saintlike face. It will make you a saint but not a meditator; it
will make you dead but not alive.</p><p>Going against nature never helps. One can be victorious only with
nature and through nature. There is no victory against nature; maybe
there are momentary victories, but one should not rejoice in those
momentary victories. They are insignificant and the price that we have
to pay for them is immense. Time is wasted, energy is wasted and the
ultimate result is zero.</p><p>Contemplation is a little more liquid, a little more fluid than
concentration. In concentration you have to remain fixed on one word or
one object -- for example, the word "love". In concentration you have to
remain fixed on these four letters of love; in contemplation you can
roam around, going into many meanings of love, you can go deep or high,
you can bring in many other ideas concerning love. Of course there is a
limit but you have a longer rope than in concentration.</p><p>So in contemplation one feels a little bit more free but one is still
tethered. You cannot go out of the subject of love. Everything else is
excluded. You cannot think about freedom or truth, you cannot think
about anything else except love. But one can think much about love, one
can ponder over it for hours or for days because love itself is an
oceanic experience. It is less tiring than concentration, more
fulfilling than concentration, but it is still not the real thing.</p><p>The real thing is meditation. In meditation you are neither
concentrating on anything nor contemplating anything; you are simply
open and available to all that is. The distant call of the cuckoo, a dog
starts barking, a child starts crying -- all is included. The train
passes by, the traffic noise . somebody is playing on a flute, the horn
of the car . the neighbours start shouting, fighting -- everything is
included. You are just a witness, watching everything without any
judgement, neither condemning nor appreciating.</p><p>This non-judgemental awareness is what I mean by meditation. It is
inclusive of</p><p>all, it excludes nothing.</p><p>It is pure openness, vulnerability. All the windows, all the doors
are open; everything is welcome, everything is just a guest and you are
a host. Many guests come and many guests go but the host remains and
abides.</p><p>Slowly slowly one becomes aware that everything comes and goes but
one is always herenow. This experience, that you are always herenow,
gives you the first feel of eternity, of the deathless, of the immortal
truth.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=just-the-tip-of-the-iceberg>Just the Tip of the Iceberg</h3><p>Chapter #2 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on

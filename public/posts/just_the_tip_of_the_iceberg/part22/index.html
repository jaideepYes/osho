It is for reference purposes only.]\n(Osho addressed Luca, a stage designer from Switzerland.) Mind is a dark hole. If one looks inside one will find only darkness because the first layer of our inner world consists of the mind. The second layer consists of the heart, and the third is our real being. When you look in -- and that's what meditation is all about looking in -- first you will find darkness. If you go on digging then you will find a twilight, neither darkness nor light; that is the realm of the heart. It is just as when the night is no more and the sun has not risen yet -- something in between. It has its own beauty, but very few people even enter into that twilight land of the heart.\nIf one goes on digging still deeper then one enters into the world of being. Then light explodes, and that light dispels all darkness, all doubts. That darkness, that doubt, which has been with you for thousands of lives disappears in a single moment, and with it death also. They are all part of one organic whole --\ndarkness, doubt and death; those three D's have to be remembered. Light takes you beyond all the three.\nLuca also means the enlightened one. That's exactly the whole purpose of sannyas: to help you to discover your enlightened state, your Buddhahood, It is\nyour nature; nothing has to be added to you.\nSomething certainly has to be thrown out, but nothing has to be taken in.\nMeditation helps you to reach to your innermost core. Once you stand there you are beyond the reach of mind, thought, memory, imagination, suddenly there is absolute silence. In that silence truth is known. That silence is truth, or you can call it god -- it is the same.\nMa Prem Susanne means a white lily, it is representative of all that is most beautiful: grace, totality, flowering, fragrance.\nMan is also a seed, just as there are seeds of trees. But the misery is that many people die as seeds. They never change their potential into an actuality, they never come to a flowering. And unless one flowers one remains unfulfilled. Unless the fragrance is released one remains imprisoned.\nLove can give you the very secret of transforming the seed into a flowering bush. It can help you to grow graceful flowers of consciousness, of bliss, of godliness, of grace.\nThe white lily is one of the very graceful flowers, and the whiteness, particularly, represents totality. No other color represents totality: white means all the colors together. White in itself is not a color, it is a synthesis of all the colors. Black is absence of all colors and white is presence of all colors. The light is white; when it passes through a prism it is divided into seven colors. That's how the rainbow is created.\nA rainbow happens only in a particular situation: in the rainy season when the rainwater is hanging in the air, small droplets of water in the air, in the atmosphere, and the sun suddenly comes out of the clouds.\nAnd when the sunrays pass those hanging drops of water, the drops of water function as a prism, they divide 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nthe rays into seven colors. Hence the rainbow is created.\nWhite represents totality, unity, oneness. Love gives you oneness with the whole. If you can love existence, that is the only true religion. You become one with it; then all distinctions, divisions, disappear.\nThe rainbow becomes a white ray again; it again becomes organically one, integrated.\nLove can do miracles. It can unite you with the whole and it can help you to transform your potential into the real. Love is the path of self-realization.\n(Build your life with bliss bricks, Osho told an engineer from Holland.) People make misery their foundation, and misery is like shifting sands. Making a house on shifting sands is creating hell for yourself. You will be crushed under it because it is going to fall at any moment; it has no rock as a foundation.\nWhy do people choose misery to be their foundation? It is really amazing. But there is a reason; misery is helpful for one thing, it helps your ego. And bliss is dangerous for the ego, it kills the ego. And we are all brought up in such a way that we become ego-oriented. Our whole education is to enhance the ego, to make us ambitious -- and ambition is insanity. Ego is nothing but sheer madness, and the egoist is bound to live in misery because he will be afraid of bliss.\nPeople talk about bliss; they say \"We want bliss,\" but they are really afraid of bliss. Whenever bliss comes they close their doors, they shrink back, they withdraw into themselves. They close themselves like turtles, they go into their shells -- they hide in their shells -- because the moment bliss happens your ego simply evaporates. And that creates panic, one is scared, because we think that we are egos and if the ego is gone then we are gone. That is not true.\nYou are not the ego. In fact, when the ego is gone you will really know who you are. Unless the ego goes you will never be able to know yourself.\nHence I teach bliss, because I know bliss is sure to destroy your ego. I don't tell you to drop the ego; I persuade you to be blissful, to be cheerful, because for that you are easily ready. At least there is a desire for bliss in everybody; one may have repressed it but it is there. It is never destroyed; it can be brought up again. And my work consists in bringing your desire for bliss to the surface. Once it is there ego dies of its own accord.\nAnd that is the most significant moment in one's life, to see ego dying and being arising. It is like clouds disappearing and the sun shining forth. And only then can you make a temple out of your life, a temple into which God can be invited, can be welcomed, can be received, can become a guest.\nBlissfulness will make you a host. If you are totally blissful, god instantly enters you. Only total blissfulness makes one worthy to receive the ultimate guest.\n(Most of us leave home, never to find it again. But there have been a few prodigal sons and daughters --\nOsho pointed out.)\nThose few are the awakened ones, the enlightened ones, the Buddhas, the Christs. We can take hints from them, we can learn much because they are constantly pointing towards the right track. But we are so stupid that we start worshipping them rather than taking the hint. Rather than looking at the moon to which their finger is pointing we start worshipping the finger.\nIn Japan there is a temple a very ancient temple, a very strange temple, because ordinarily in a Buddhist temple there is a Buddha statue, not only one but many. There are temples of Buddha where there are thousands of statues. In China there is one temple which has ten thousand statues of Buddha. For centuries Buddhist monks have carved Buddha statues out of the whole of the mountain. Even to go around all those statues takes days -- ten thousand statues!\nIn this strange temple there is not a single statue inside, but only a finger and nothing else. And just underneath it there is a quote from Buddha: I only point the way, you have to follow it Buddhas only show the way; you have to follow it.\nBliss is already our nature, our intrinsic nature, but we have become so artificial, so unnatural, hence there has come a division between our reality and our personality. Our personality is bogus, false, pseudo.\nAnd the process of sannyas is of dropping the personality so that you can discover the individuality. And that is a gift of god. In that individuality bliss is the first encounter; the first meeting is that of bliss. And then there are many facets and dimensions to your inner being: love, grace, silence, truth, freedom. There is no end, it is a multi-dimensional phenomenon. But the first thing that happens is a tremendous ecstasy.\nBut remember, it is not our achievement, it is god's gift. To know it and to remember it keeps one 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- humble.\n(The real Christian is he or she who has the consciousness of a celebrant, Osho told Kerstin.) Being a Christian has nothing to do with Christianity. It has nothing to do with the church, a creed, a dogma; it has something to do with your own consciousness. If your consciousness becomes blissful you attain to the same state as Christ -- and that is the only way to be a Christian. Being a Christ is the only way to be a Christian.\nBelieving in Christ won't help. Millions of people believe in Christ, millions of others believe in Buddha, and so on, and so forth; neither the Buddhists are Buddhas nor the Christians are Christs -- they are just believers. Belief is cheap; it does not transform you.\nTransformation needs guts. That's why Jesus says everybody has to carry their cross on their own shoulders. It is a symbolic message. It is not that you have to carry a wooden cross continuously on your shoulders, but it means that one has to crucify something within oneself, the ego; it is the barrier in bliss.\nOne has to crucify all that is false so that the real can reveal itself as it is. (Then he made Jurgen a farmer of love.)\nOne of the greatest tragedies that has happened to humanity is that we are brought up with a wrong notion that we already know what love is. We don't. And because of this false notion we live without love.\nOf course all that is needed to know is provided, all that is needed to create that music called love is within you. But it is like a guitar: you are there, the guitar is there, but you don't know how to play upon it. Music will not be born.\nThe potential of love is there, the seed of love is there, but you have to know how to cultivate it, how to be a farmer, how to be a gardener; what climate is needed, what season is right to sow the seeds and how much water and how much manure and how much sun and how much shade. One has to be very intelligent, only then the most delicate flower.…\nThere is nothing more delicate than love; even roses are not as delicate. Unless one is very intelligent one will not be able to grow into love.\nLife is an opportunity to grow the qualities of love, to bring love to a state of ultimate flowering. But one should not think from the very beginning that one knows what it is. That very idea prevents you from moving into the world of transformation.\nIt is like an ill person who thinks he is healthy. Now, he is going to die because he will not take any notice of illness. In fact he will repress it, he will avoid it, he will not look at it. Even if it comes and insists on being taken notice of, he will deny it. He will fight with it and he will say, \"You are not there. I don't believe in you. I am perfectly healthy.\" Now, this man is in a really dangerous state and the danger is not coming from illness, the danger is coming from his stubbornness in rejecting it. If he accepts it, then something can be done; then cure is possible. And the sooner one becomes aware, the better. Then it can be prevented from the very beginning.\nIn a better human society we will tell every child, \"You have the seeds of love, of bliss, of truth, but they are seeds. Your whole life has to be a tremendous effort to sow the seeds, to learn the art of growing, to be patient to wait for the seeds to sprout, then to take care of the plants and still to prayerfully wait for the right season when the flowering happens.\"\nAnd that's what we are doing here. It is an experiment in inner farming, in inner gardening, in inner agriculture. But the first thing has to be the shock that up to now you have lived in vain and whatsoever you have done has been done from wrong ideas. And we have to make the slate clean, so the whole past is simply put aside.\nA sannyasin has to begin from scratch. Sannyas is a new birth. It is as if you are born today and now you have to start living.\nForget the past, don't go on carrying it. It has not given you anything. It has been\ntragic -- no need to remain burdened with it. Become free of it so that you can experiment afresh. Then sannyas is a great adventure.\n(Meditation is not-minding. This was the message to Dhyan Sandesh. Mind is our prison, said Osho.) We are imprisoned in our thoughts, ideologies, philosophies. We have to go beyond words and scriptures and theories, only then does one start experiencing the truth. Theories are about truth, but to know about truth is not to know truth itself. Meditation makes you capable of knowing the truth directly.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nI don't give you any ideas about truth, not even definitions about truth. I only give you certain strategies, devices, which can help you to go beyond the mind. I provide ladders so the prisoners can jump out of their prisons. I help you to know how to bribe the guards so that when you escape from the prison they pretend to be fast asleep. I provide you with keys to unlock the doors.\nI am not interested in philosophy at all. My approach is existential. Meditation is something existential, not theoretical, not intellectual.\nSo being a sannyasin means being a meditator, nothing else. Put all your energies into meditation because when one is imprisoned the first thing is to get out of the prison; everything else is a sheer wastage of time. You can go on reading the Bible in the prison -- Bibles are provided for the prisoners! You can go on reciting the Gita or the Koran, and they can help you to forget the walls you are surrounded by. But that is living in a fool's world -- those walls are there.\nLadders are needed, Bibles are not needed. Or if you have got Bibles, use them as stepping stones. Put Bibles upon each other, make a ladder so that you can reach the top of the wall and jump! That's the only use scriptures can be put to, otherwise they are useless.\nThe only priority, the first priority, is to get free of the mind, then everything else follows of its own accord.\n(Osho returned to a favourite theme of his -- the meaninglessness of outer achievements and victories unless one is master of oneself.)\nAlexander the Great died crying because he became aware that his whole life had been a sheer wastage because death was going to destroy everything and he had used his whole life chasing after things which death was taking away. So what was the point? He had never allowed himself to live. He loved a woman but he could not live with the woman because his whole interest was in conquering the world. He loved his mother but he could not be with her because he constantly had to go on conquering new lands.\nHe promised his mother that he would come back, once he had conquered the world he would come back home. But he could not reach home either. That was a great wound. He died on the way back from India. His mother was not very far away, only twenty-four hours away -- just a journey of twenty-four hours. He told his physicians, \"I can give you my whole kingdom -- help me to fulfil my promise!\" But the physicians said, \"Even if you give your whole kingdom we cannot do anything -- death has come. You cannot survive more than two or three hours, and it is better to rest, relax. There is no point -- you cannot reach your mother.\"\nNow this man died when he was only thirty-three. A small life, but even that was wasted in something unessential.\nMeditation means going inwards, reaching your innermost core, entering your interiority. And it is a vast phenomenon. It has its own infinity, eternity. It knows nothing of birth and nothing of death. It knows nothing of time; it is beyond time and space both. To know it is to know god -- and that is the real treasure, the real kingdom.\n(To wind up the evening Osho described the different levels of bliss, starting with what we know as pleasure -- that is related to the body.)\nIf it comes through the mind it is happiness, we know it as happiness. If it comes through meditation --\nthat is through being -- then it is bliss, then it is pure. Pleasure depends on the\nbody and the body is not trustworthy. It is there today, tomorrow it is gone.\nToday it is young, tomorrow it is old. Today it is healthy, tomorrow it is sick. It is not dependable; one should not trust it very much. It is a very temporary abode\n-- just a bamboo hut. A small earthquake is enough to finish it! Or just a small fire, or just a strong wind, and it is gone, gone with the wind! One should not invest too much in the physical world.\nAnd happiness also is not of any more value -- a little higher than pleasure, a little better, but just a little.\nThere is not much difference. There is a difference but that difference is only of quantity not of quality. You can be happy with poetry, with painting, with music, but the same song repeated again and again will create boredom. You have heard the music and it was beautiful, but if you hear it again and again soon you will be fed up with it. It is momentary, it is constantly changing. You cannot be at ease with it, at rest with it. It creates tensions in you because the old pleasure becomes pain, the old happiness becomes unhappiness. The moment that you were happy with becomes a headache.\nAnd the more intelligent you are, the sooner it happens It is only the dull numbskulls that the same 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nwoman, the same man, can go on giving pleasure for their whole life. It is simply stupidity, nothing else!\nOtherwise once you have known the whole geography of the woman or the man it is finished. You have explored the whole territory, now there is nothing more in it.\nBliss is qualitatively different. It does not depend on the outside world, neither on woman nor on wine, neither on love nor on music. It depends on nothing. It is just the joy of sheer existence. You are simply happy for no reason at all. It is uncaused, unmotivated. It is authentically yours.\nHence, except for meditation, there is no door to real bliss; all others are temporary substitutes. And the miracle is, if you have known bliss then you can transform even physical pleasure into bliss, then you can transform psychological happiness into bliss. But that is possible only if you have known the ultimate bliss.\nThen you can bring that ultimate bliss to the dark valleys of the mind and the still darker valleys of the body.\nA meditator loving a woman or a man has a different quality to his love. It is that of sharing, it is not of demand. He does not want anything from the other, in fact, he wants to give. It is not a question of \"Give me more, this is not enough.\" He wants to give himself because he has too much. He is like a raincloud, so full it wants to shower. A meditator can transform the quality of music, painting, poetry, because he can bring something of the beyond into them.\nAnd that's the difference between real creativity and pseudo creativity. pseudo creativity remains of the mind and real creativity comes out of being.\nJust the Tip of the Iceberg Chapter #23\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"3556","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/just_the_tip_of_the_iceberg/part22/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/just_the_tip_of_the_iceberg/>Just The Tip Of The Iceberg</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>17 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;3556 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Just_The_Tip_Of_The_Iceberg/part22.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part21>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

doubts. That darkness, that doubt, which has been with you for thousands
of lives disappears in a single moment, and with it death also. They are
all part of one organic whole --</p><p>darkness, doubt and death; those three D's have to be remembered.
Light takes you beyond all the three.</p><p>Luca also means the enlightened one. That's exactly the whole purpose
of sannyas: to help you to discover your enlightened state, your
Buddhahood, It is</p><p>your nature; nothing has to be added to you.</p><p>Something certainly has to be thrown out, but nothing has to be taken
in.</p><p>Meditation helps you to reach to your innermost core. Once you stand
there you are beyond the reach of mind, thought, memory, imagination,
suddenly there is absolute silence. In that silence truth is known. That
silence is truth, or you can call it god -- it is the same.</p><p>Ma Prem Susanne means a white lily, it is representative of all that
is most beautiful: grace, totality, flowering, fragrance.</p><p>Man is also a seed, just as there are seeds of trees. But the misery
is that many people die as seeds. They never change their potential into
an actuality, they never come to a flowering. And unless one flowers one
remains unfulfilled. Unless the fragrance is released one remains
imprisoned.</p><p>Love can give you the very secret of transforming the seed into a
flowering bush. It can help you to grow graceful flowers of
consciousness, of bliss, of godliness, of grace.</p><p>The white lily is one of the very graceful flowers, and the
whiteness, particularly, represents totality. No other color represents
totality: white means all the colors together. White in itself is not a
color, it is a synthesis of all the colors. Black is absence of all
colors and white is presence of all colors. The light is white; when it
passes through a prism it is divided into seven colors. That's how the
rainbow is created.</p><p>A rainbow happens only in a particular situation: in the rainy season
when the rainwater is hanging in the air, small droplets of water in the
air, in the atmosphere, and the sun suddenly comes out of the
clouds.</p><p>And when the sunrays pass those hanging drops of water, the drops of
water function as a prism, they divide 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished>Osho's books on

with the whole. If you can love existence, that is the only true
religion. You become one with it; then all distinctions, divisions,
disappear.</p><p>The rainbow becomes a white ray again; it again becomes organically
one, integrated.</p><p>Love can do miracles. It can unite you with the whole and it can help
you to transform your potential into the real. Love is the path of
self-realization.</p><p>(Build your life with bliss bricks, Osho told an engineer from
Holland.) People make misery their foundation, and misery is like
shifting sands. Making a house on shifting sands is creating hell for
yourself. You will be crushed under it because it is going to fall at
any moment; it has no rock as a foundation.</p><p>Why do people choose misery to be their foundation? It is really
amazing. But there is a reason; misery is helpful for one thing, it
helps your ego. And bliss is dangerous for the ego, it kills the ego.
And we are all brought up in such a way that we become ego-oriented. Our
whole education is to enhance the ego, to make us ambitious -- and
ambition is insanity. Ego is nothing but sheer madness, and the egoist
is bound to live in misery because he will be afraid of bliss.</p><p>People talk about bliss; they say "We want bliss," but they are
really afraid of bliss. Whenever bliss comes they close their doors,
they shrink back, they withdraw into themselves. They close themselves
like turtles, they go into their shells -- they hide in their shells --
because the moment bliss happens your ego simply evaporates. And that
creates panic, one is scared, because we think that we are egos and if
the ego is gone then we are gone. That is not true.</p><p>You are not the ego. In fact, when the ego is gone you will really
know who you are. Unless the ego goes you will never be able to know
yourself.</p><p>Hence I teach bliss, because I know bliss is sure to destroy your
ego. I don't tell you to drop the ego; I persuade you to be blissful, to
be cheerful, because for that you are easily ready. At least there is a
desire for bliss in everybody; one may have repressed it but it is
there. It is never destroyed; it can be brought up again. And my work
consists in bringing your desire for bliss to the surface. Once it is
there ego dies of its own accord.</p><p>And that is the most significant moment in one's life, to see ego
dying and being arising. It is like clouds disappearing and the sun
shining forth. And only then can you make a temple out of your life, a
temple into which God can be invited, can be welcomed, can be received,
can become a guest.</p><p>Blissfulness will make you a host. If you are totally blissful, god
instantly enters you. Only total blissfulness makes one worthy to
receive the ultimate guest.</p><p>(Most of us leave home, never to find it again. But there have been a
few prodigal sons and daughters --</p><p>Osho pointed out.)</p><p>Those few are the awakened ones, the enlightened ones, the Buddhas,
the Christs. We can take hints from them, we can learn much because they
are constantly pointing towards the right track. But we are so stupid
that we start worshipping them rather than taking the hint. Rather than
looking at the moon to which their finger is pointing we start
worshipping the finger.</p><p>In Japan there is a temple a very ancient temple, a very strange
temple, because ordinarily in a Buddhist temple there is a Buddha
statue, not only one but many. There are temples of Buddha where there
are thousands of statues. In China there is one temple which has ten
thousand statues of Buddha. For centuries Buddhist monks have carved
Buddha statues out of the whole of the mountain. Even to go around all
those statues takes days -- ten thousand statues!</p><p>In this strange temple there is not a single statue inside, but only
a finger and nothing else. And just underneath it there is a quote from
Buddha: I only point the way, <em>you</em> have to follow it Buddhas
only show the way; you have to follow it.</p><p>Bliss is already our nature, our intrinsic nature, but we have become
so artificial, so unnatural, hence there has come a division between our
reality and our personality. Our personality is bogus, false,
pseudo.</p><p>And the process of sannyas is of dropping the personality so that you
can discover the individuality. And that is a gift of god. In that
individuality bliss is the first encounter; the first meeting is that of
bliss. And then there are many facets and dimensions to your inner
being: love, grace, silence, truth, freedom. There is no end, it is a
multi-dimensional phenomenon. But the first thing that happens is a
tremendous ecstasy.</p><p>But remember, it is not our achievement, it is god's gift. To know it
and to remember it keeps one 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on

celebrant, Osho told Kerstin.) Being a Christian has nothing to do with
Christianity. It has nothing to do with the church, a creed, a dogma; it
has something to do with your own consciousness. If your consciousness
becomes blissful you attain to the same state as Christ -- and that is
the only way to be a Christian. Being a Christ is the only way to be a
Christian.</p><p>Believing in Christ won't help. Millions of people believe in Christ,
millions of others believe in Buddha, and so on, and so forth; neither
the Buddhists are Buddhas nor the Christians are Christs -- they are
just believers. Belief is cheap; it does not transform you.</p><p>Transformation needs guts. That's why Jesus says everybody has to
carry their cross on their own shoulders. It is a symbolic message. It
is not that you have to carry a wooden cross continuously on your
shoulders, but it means that one has to crucify something within
oneself, the ego; it is the barrier in bliss.</p><p>One has to crucify all that is false so that the real can reveal
itself as it is. (Then he made Jurgen a farmer of love.)</p><p>One of the greatest tragedies that has happened to humanity is that
we are brought up with a wrong notion that we already know what love is.
We don't. And because of this false notion we live without love.</p><p>Of course all that is needed to know is provided, all that is needed
to create that music called love is within you. But it is like a guitar:
you are there, the guitar is there, but you don't know how to play upon
it. Music will not be born.</p><p>The potential of love is there, the seed of love is there, but you
have to know how to cultivate it, how to be a farmer, how to be a
gardener; what climate is needed, what season is right to sow the seeds
and how much water and how much manure and how much sun and how much
shade. One has to be very intelligent, only then the most delicate
flower.…</p><p>There is nothing more delicate than love; even roses are not as
delicate. Unless one is very intelligent one will not be able to grow
into love.</p><p>Life is an opportunity to grow the qualities of love, to bring love
to a state of ultimate flowering. But one should not think from the very
beginning that one knows what it is. That very idea prevents you from
moving into the world of transformation.</p><p>It is like an ill person who thinks he is healthy. Now, he is going
to die because he will not take any notice of illness. In fact he will
repress it, he will avoid it, he will not look at it. Even if it comes
and insists on being taken notice of, he will deny it. He will fight
with it and he will say, "You are not there. I don't believe in you. I
am perfectly healthy." Now, this man is in a really dangerous state and
the danger is not coming from illness, the danger is coming from his
stubbornness in rejecting it. If he accepts it, then something can be
done; then cure is possible. And the sooner one becomes aware, the
better. Then it can be prevented from the very beginning.</p><p>In a better human society we will tell every child, "You have the
seeds of love, of bliss, of truth, but they are seeds. Your whole life
has to be a tremendous effort to sow the seeds, to learn the art of
growing, to be patient to wait for the seeds to sprout, then to take
care of the plants and still to prayerfully wait for the right season
when the flowering happens."</p><p>And that's what we are doing here. It is an experiment in inner
farming, in inner gardening, in inner agriculture. But the first thing
has to be the shock that up to now you have lived in vain and whatsoever
you have done has been done from wrong ideas. And we have to make the
slate clean, so the whole past is simply put aside.</p><p>A sannyasin has to begin from scratch. Sannyas is a new birth. It is
as if you are born today and now you have to start living.</p><p>Forget the past, don't go on carrying it. It has not given you
anything. It has been</p><p>tragic -- no need to remain burdened with it. Become free of it so
that you can experiment afresh. Then sannyas is a great adventure.</p><p>(Meditation is not-minding. This was the message to Dhyan Sandesh.
Mind is our prison, said Osho.) We are imprisoned in our thoughts,
ideologies, philosophies. We have to go beyond words and scriptures and
theories, only then does one start experiencing the truth. Theories are
<em>about</em> truth, but to know about truth is not to know truth
itself. Meditation makes you capable of knowing the truth directly.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on

truth. I only give you certain strategies, devices, which can help you
to go beyond the mind. I provide ladders so the prisoners can jump out
of their prisons. I help you to know how to bribe the guards so that
when you escape from the prison they pretend to be fast asleep. I
provide you with keys to unlock the doors.</p><p>I am not interested in philosophy at all. My approach is existential.
Meditation is something existential, not theoretical, not
intellectual.</p><p>So being a sannyasin means being a meditator, nothing else. Put all
your energies into meditation because when one is imprisoned the first
thing is to get out of the prison; everything else is a sheer wastage of
time. You can go on reading the Bible in the prison -- Bibles are
provided for the prisoners! You can go on reciting the Gita or the
Koran, and they can help you to forget the walls you are surrounded by.
But that is living in a fool's world -- those walls <em>are</em>
there.</p><p>Ladders are needed, Bibles are not needed. Or if you have got Bibles,
use them as stepping stones. Put Bibles upon each other, make a ladder
so that you can reach the top of the wall and jump! That's the only use
scriptures can be put to, otherwise they are useless.</p><p>The only priority, the first priority, is to get free of the mind,
then everything else follows of its own accord.</p><p>(Osho returned to a favourite theme of his -- the meaninglessness of
outer achievements and victories unless one is master of oneself.)</p><p>Alexander the Great died crying because he became aware that his
whole life had been a sheer wastage because death was going to destroy
everything and he had used his whole life chasing after things which
death was taking away. So what was the point? He had never allowed
himself to live. He loved a woman but he could not live with the woman
because his whole interest was in conquering the world. He loved his
mother but he could not be with her because he constantly had to go on
conquering new lands.</p><p>He promised his mother that he would come back, once he had conquered
the world he would come back home. But he could not reach home either.
That was a great wound. He died on the way back from India. His mother
was not very far away, only twenty-four hours away -- just a journey of
twenty-four hours. He told his physicians, "I can give you my whole
kingdom -- help me to fulfil my promise!" But the physicians said, "Even
if you give your whole kingdom we cannot do anything -- death has come.
You cannot survive more than two or three hours, and it is better to
rest, relax. There is no point -- you cannot reach your mother."</p><p>Now this man died when he was only thirty-three. A small life, but
even that was wasted in something unessential.</p><p>Meditation means going inwards, reaching your innermost core,
entering your interiority. And it is a vast phenomenon. It has its own
infinity, eternity. It knows nothing of birth and nothing of death. It
knows nothing of time; it is beyond time and space both. To know it is
to know god -- and that is the real treasure, the real kingdom.</p><p>(To wind up the evening Osho described the different levels of bliss,
starting with what we know as pleasure -- that is related to the
body.)</p><p>If it comes through the mind it is happiness, we know it as
happiness. If it comes through meditation --</p><p>that is through being -- then it is bliss, then it is pure. Pleasure
depends on the</p><p>body and the body is not trustworthy. It is there today, tomorrow it
is gone.</p><p>Today it is young, tomorrow it is old. Today it is healthy, tomorrow
it is sick. It is not dependable; one should not trust it very much. It
is a very temporary abode</p><p>-- just a bamboo hut. A small earthquake is enough to finish it! Or
just a small fire, or just a strong wind, and it is gone, gone with the
wind! One should not invest too much in the physical world.</p><p>And happiness also is not of any more value -- a little higher than
pleasure, a little better, but just a little.</p><p>There is not much difference. There is a difference but that
difference is only of quantity not of quality. You can be happy with
poetry, with painting, with music, but the same song repeated again and
again will create boredom. You have heard the music and it was
beautiful, but if you hear it again and again soon you will be fed up
with it. It is momentary, it is constantly changing. You cannot be at
ease with it, at rest with it. It creates tensions in you because the
old pleasure becomes pain, the old happiness becomes unhappiness. The
moment that you were happy with becomes a headache.</p><p>And the more intelligent you are, the sooner it happens It is only
the dull numbskulls that the same 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on

It is simply stupidity, nothing else!</p><p>Otherwise once you have known the whole geography of the woman or the
man it is finished. You have explored the whole territory, now there is
nothing more in it.</p><p>Bliss is qualitatively different. It does not depend on the outside
world, neither on woman nor on wine, neither on love nor on music. It
depends on nothing. It is just the joy of sheer existence. You are
simply happy for no reason at all. It is uncaused, unmotivated. It is
authentically yours.</p><p>Hence, except for meditation, there is no door to real bliss; all
others are temporary substitutes. And the miracle is, if you have known
bliss then you can transform even physical pleasure into bliss, then you
can transform psychological happiness into bliss. But that is possible
only if you have known the ultimate bliss.</p><p>Then you can bring that ultimate bliss to the dark valleys of the
mind and the still darker valleys of the body.</p><p>A meditator loving a woman or a man has a different quality to his
love. It is that of sharing, it is not of demand. He does not want
anything from the other, in fact, he wants to give. It is not a question
of "Give me more, this is not enough." He wants to give himself because
he has too much. He is like a raincloud, so full it wants to shower. A
meditator can transform the quality of music, painting, poetry, because
he can bring something of the beyond into them.</p><p>And that's the difference between real creativity and pseudo
creativity. pseudo creativity remains of the mind and real creativity
comes out of being.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:justify id=just-the-tip-of-the-iceberg>Just the Tip of the Iceberg</h3><p>Chapter #23</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part21>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

It is for reference purposes only.]\n(Osho talked about the meaning of the word 'shunyam'. It means nothingness, and it is a tremendously positive state.)\nIt simply means space is there without any content. But the space is very positive, in fact more than it was when it was too full of things -- past, desires, memories, imaginings, expectations. These are the contents of your inner world. We are full of these, and they are so many that they don't leave any space for ourselves to be. We are very much overcrowded.\nThis is the real problem, how to disperse this crowd. And this crowd does not believe in birth control; it is a very Indian crowd. Each thought goes on generating thousands of thoughts, each desire goes on giving birth to many more\ndesires, each dream brings thousands of dreams in its wake. So the inner world goes on becoming more and more crowded, more and more clumsy, more and more chaotic.\nThe child comes with pure silence. His slate is empty. It has a grace, a beauty, the music of silence. But we start stuffing each child with religious ideology, political ideology. We start poisoning each child with an ambition. We create desires in him, we create competition in him, we create imitativeness in him. We tell him, \"Look, you have to be this, you have to be the president or the prime minister of the country, you have to be the richest man.\"\nThat must have been the desire of your parents when they gave you the name, Max; Max means the greatest. Every parent wants his child to be the greatest, an Alexander the Great. Each parent is living his unfulfilled desires through his children. He has not been able to fulfil his desires. Nobody has ever been able to fulfil their desires because desire as such is unfulfillable. Nothing can be done about it; it is not in the nature of things, it is not the law of life.\nTo be full of desires simply means to await thousands of frustrations, failures. Desires bring only frustration. They create great expectation, and when they fall apart -- and they are bound to fall apart sooner or later -- one is disillusioned. And one has carried the illusion for so long and has become so attached to it that one feels lost. Whenever a desire gets frustrated one is wounded. And those wounds go on accumulating.\nEach child comes into the world healthy and whole and we immediately start wounding him. Up to now humanity has existed in a very wrong way. Something basically, fundamentally, is wrong. Our whole education is ambitious, it is political; our religions are political. Maybe they are the politics of the beyond, but they are politics. You have to reach heaven, you have to be a great achiever there in the other world too.\nNobody says to just be empty of all content, because in that emptiness, in that nothingness, flowers the ultimate\nIf one is ready to become a nobody then one becomes the greatest -- that is the meaning of Max. So I am giving you a paradoxical name. Be nothing then you are all, be nobody then you attain to tremendous extraordinariness. Just be empty and you will come to know the greatest in you, the highest in you. But\nremember, don't be nothing to become the greatest because then you cannot be nothing. To be nothing is not to be used as a means to be the greatest. It cannot be a means, it is an end unto itself. The greatness is a by-product, not the goal, not the end.\nIt is like a fragrance. The flower is the end, the flowering of your consciousness is all, and then suddenly there is fragrance. If you search for fragrance you will miss the flower, and without the flower there is no fragrance. If you search for the flower the fragrance comes of its own accord.\nHence the really great are not Alexanders, the really great are Jesus, Buddha, Lao Tzu. They were very simple people, with no desire to be anybody in particular -- humble. Jesus says \"Blessed are the meek for theirs is the kingdom of god.\" That's exactly the meaning of your name. That statement is paradoxical: the most blessed are the meek, for theirs is the kingdom of god.\nIf one is meek, humble, nobody, then the doors of the kingdom open, then you are a divine guest. Then suddenly you are raised to the highest pinnacle of life. But that is a by-product. To attain the kingdom of god is not a goal. Forget all about it -- just be nothing.\nThis is my whole teaching here, just to be a nobody. Just go on throwing out all the rotten furniture from inside your being and become utterly spacious. And that space is very overflowing, overflowing with your 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nbeing, because the being can grow, it has space to grow. The being can open its petals, it can become a thousand-petalled lotus. And then there is great dance inside and great music and great poetry and great beauty and grace. Then the whole imprisoned splendour is released because there is no barrier to hinder it.\nYou become expansive. Life becomes an explosion of light, of love, of bliss.\n(And love is another way of learning to be a nobody, Osho went on to say.) Love is nothing but the disappearance of the dewdrop into the ocean. It is losing one's\nego, it is total surrender to existence. It is meeting with the whole, it is dropping your boundaries and your identity. It is abandoning yourself. The moment you abandon yourself, immediately you become oceanic, vast.\nWe are clinging to our identity. We protect it, we fight for it, we are even ready to die for it. And this is just stupidity because the ego is the most false thing in existence. It is just hot air, it has no real existence. It is like darkness.\nYou can see darkness, every day you see it, but it has no existence as such. It is simply absence of light\n-- nothing in itself, just an absence of light. Bring the light in and you don't find any darkness, and you never even see it going out of the door. Put the light off and it is suddenly there. It does not come in; you can keep the doors and windows closed. It comes from nowhere because it is non -- existential, it is just absence. It does not come and go. Light comes and goes because light is.\nThe same is true about our ego. Ego is absence of love. The moment you bring the light of love in, ego disappears. You need not do anything else for the ego; just become more loving, unconditionally loving.\nLove is not to be addressed to somebody in particular, just be loving -- that has to be your quality. It has nothing to do with relationship. Love has to be like fragrance. Whether anybody comes to know of it or not, does not matter to the flower. Even in the farthest Himalayas, where nobody comes and goes, thousands of flowers bloom and spread their fragrance.\nIn the Himalayas there is a whole valley of very strange flowers. People have only seen it from the peaks, nobody has been able to reach it because it is dangerous to go down into that valley. People know about those flowers but nobody has smelled their perfume; and they have very psychedelic colours. They are far away, but they are not worried at all about that; the flowers are perfectly happy.\nLove has to be just your quality. Become loving, and one day it happens that you are simply love; not even loving but love. That is the day of great revelation. In that very moment the dewdrop disappears into the ocean and becomes the ocean.\nIn religious terminology, in religious jargon, it has been called god-realisation. If one likes religious jargon one can use that word, otherwise it is far more\nbeautiful to say that one becomes oceanic; it is far more poetic. priests have contaminated the word \"god\" too much and they have been quarrelling around the word \"god\" for so many centuries that the very word immediately raises a thousand and one questions. It simply creates more and more arguments and controversies. But the word in itself was beautiful when used for the first time; it simply represented the beyond, the vast beyond.\nNow it does not represent the beyond any more. Even the beyond has been exploited by priests. Priests are the most cunning people. They have made god a Christian god, a Hindu god, a Mohammedan god. Now nothing more absurd can be done, it is the ultimate in absurdity. God cannot be Hindu or Jewish or Buddhist. God simply means vastness, and to make vastness Christian is to make it small. Any adjective will make it limited. God has to be without any adjective. It simply means the infinite existence, the unbounded. And love will give you the first taste of it.\nJust a drop of the nectar is enough to transform one. Once you have tasted love you will automatically drop all that is against love -- all hatred, anger, jealousy, all violence. One cannot carry them any more because they are your enemies. One cannot go on nourishing them. One simply drops them out of the understanding that arises with love, that love brings in.\nAll these things -- violence, hatred, anger, jealousy, possessiveness -- are part of darkness. So bring in the light of love. That's the purpose of sannyas.\n(Don't be part of the crowd -- either the internal one we call the mind, nor the outer that is society.\nHaving touched on the former earlier in the evening Osho turned to the subject of society versus the seer.) Meditation is the greatest rebellion in the world. It is not ordinary revolution. Revolution has a political colour to it. Revolution is of the crowds rebellion is of the individual.\nRevolution is of necessity political, because a crowd means politics. The communist revolution or the socialist revolution or the fascist revolution -- Russian, French, Chinese -- it does not matter what kind of 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nrevolution and what type of ideology, one thing is essential, that the crowd is there. And being part of a crowd means that you are functioning at the lowest level of intelligence.\nTo control the crowd, to be appealing to the crowd, to convince the crowd, you have to come down very low. You have to come down to where the crowd is. You have to speak their language. They understand violence, they understand murder. The crowd consists of collective stupidity, hence all revolutions are murderous, violent, unintelligent. But the crowd has a power of its own because ninety-nine per cent of the people are in it.\nThe rebel stands alone -- that's the beauty of it. A Buddha, a Zarathustra, a Jesus\n-- these are rebels, not revolutionaries. Karl Marx, Engels, Lenin, Mao, Stalin, Hitler, Gandhi -- these are revolutionaries. They have to go with the crowd, only then will the crowd go with them.\nA rebel does not bother about whether anybody comes with him or not. He cannot compromise on any account; he cannot come down from his heights. He gives a call, certainly, to everybody who is receptive, but he remains on the peak. He is the ultimate peak of intelligence.\nMeditation means the purest intelligence, uncontaminated intelligence, pure intelligence -- not intellectuality. Intellectuality is a totally different matter. You can become an intellectual by going to university, visiting the British Museum and going to the libraries and studying scriptures. You can become an intellectual; meditation is not needed for intellect. And the intellectual goes on collecting rubbish. He becomes a great rubbish-collector; his mind is just a junkyard, and everything is borrowed.\nIntelligence has nothing to do with the outside, with borrowing from the Vedas or the Bible or the Koran\n-- no. It is discovering one's own inner sources. It is discovering one's own centre. That's what meditation is all about: a discovery of one's own centre. And the moment you know who you are, there is a great explosion of intelligence.\nBuddha is not an intellectual, neither is Jesus nor is Lao Tzu, but they are tremendously intelligent. They have the clearest insight into things, a direct\ninsight, an immediate insight. They don't go via anything, their eyes are unclouded. There is no smoke in their mind, their flames are without any smoke\n-- flames of intelligence with no smoke. Hence wherever they look, wherever their light falls, they can see exactly what is, they know what is.\nMeditation is sharpening your intelligence, and this sharpening happens through silence. Thoughts make the intellectual; no-thought is the way to attain intelligence.\nThinking is of the head, of the mind, and the state of no-mind is the beginning of a totally new dimension in you when all thoughts cease and there is simple silence as if a full stop has come. Nothing moves, everything has stopped. Time has stopped; one is simply in the present. In that tremendous moment\n-- because it is the most alive moment of your life -- you discover yourself. And that brings a rebellion to your being. You are another person totally. You are reborn. You are no more the same old person -- the old dies. You are not even continuous with the old. It is not that the old has become refined, the old has simply evaporated.\nYou are a totally new person, a discontinuous phenomenon. With this aliveness whatsoever a person does, whatsoever he says, he is bound to be rebellious. Very few people will be able to understand him. The masses cannot understand. They will be against him, they have always been against meditators. They have been afraid of people like Jesus and Socrates and Mansoor. They have killed them for the simple reason that they could not digest their vision, they could not accept that somebody could be on such a height. To accept somebody on such a height means to accept that you are living in darkness. It is humiliating.\nThe mobs took revenge. They felt insulted; that's how the stupid person functions, behaves. When there is a man like Jesus, only the very few people who have a little bit of intelligence, who can see what he is, who can hear and understand, who have a little love and trust, who can go with him into the beyond, who can understand his message... They are bound to be very few. Rare people will be with a person like Jesus.\nThe masses, whether Jews or Hindus or Mohammedans, it does not matter -- will feel humiliated, insulted. And the only way to regain their ego is to destroy such a person, to remove him from the scene, because his very presence makes them\nfeel guilty that they have not been doing what they should be doing, that they are not what they should be. His presence reminds them that they have missed the opportunity of life -- and they cannot forgive him.\nThey can worship him when he is gone but when he is alive they cannot forgive him. And because they cannot forgive him when he is alive, they are bound to worship him when he is gone. They will destroy the person themselves and then they will feel guilty again, a new guilt will arise. All these religions are born out of guilt.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThe Jews killed Jesus and then started feeling guilty about what they had done. They looked at their hands and they were red with the blood of an innocent person -- and they started feeling shaken. Now the only way was to repent, worship. Worship is just a way to get rid of guilt. A very strange world this is: first you kill a person, then you worship him.\nThe cross even became part of their worship; the cross is worshipped. Even after two thousand years we have not forgotten the guilt; somehow everybody feels that we have been part of that conspiracy. Judas was not alone. Judas felt so guilty that the next day, within twenty-four hours, he committed suicide. But the whole of humanity has somehow felt that had a part in it -- even now, although we were not present when Jesus was killed and Socrates was poisoned and Buddha was stoned. We were not there. But we know that if a man like Buddha or a man like Jesus is here, we will do the same; hence the guilt. To cover the guilt we worship them. Worship is not religious, it is out of a guilty conscience.\nThe intelligent person loves such people when they are alive. The unintelligent hates such people when they are alive, it tries to destroy such people when they are alive and when they are gone, it worships them.\nThe intelligent, when such people are gone, do not worship, there is no need; there is no guilt. When they are gone, they are gone. He searches again to see if\nthere is somebody else who can help him. The intelligent person never becomes a Christian or a Hindu or a Mohammedan, he always tries to find an alive master\n-- because a dead master is no more there. Remember this: the stupid worships the dead and the intelligent searches for the alive. Initiation is possible only through an alive master. How can the dead help?\nYou can worship them but no help is going to come.\nWith meditation your intelligence will start functioning -- it is dormant. And it will bring a rebellion, first in you and then it starts spreading and radiating to others. It is like wildfire.\nThat's why I have chosen the colour of fire for my sannyasins, all the shades of fire -- I want to spread this fire all over the earth. Let this fire reach to every heart that is capable of transformation. Let the whole world go through a rebellion. It needs it; in fact it should have happened by now. We are already late. The morning has gone, the afternoon has gone. It has already become evening, the sun is almost ready to set.\nAny day the third world war, could end the whole thing. It is time to hurry and to transform oneself and to help others to be transformed.'\n(Unless truth happens to you, it's a lie; and the only way to allow that happening is meditation. But that covers all sorts of activities, Osho explained to the last sannyasin.) Knowledge can be untrue if it is borrowed, then it is only pseudo. It appears to be knowledge but because it has not happened to you it has no meaning at all. You are simply full of words, theories, but they are all empty. Unless something is your own authentic experience it never becomes true, it remains untrue.\nWhat Jesus says you can repeat, you can repeat it in exactly the same words. You can learn the language that Jesus spoke, Aramaic, and you can speak Aramaic. You can repeat the exact words but they won't have any meaning because you don't have a Christ-consciousness behind them.\nUnless one becomes a Christ one's words cannot have the same meaning as Jesus'. Unless one becomes a Buddha one cannot understand what this man is saying. Yes, words will be heard, and one can go on accumulating words in one's memory system. We have an immense memory system; in fact no computer has yet been evolved which can compete with our memory system.\nIt is said that a single memory system, a single man of average intelligence, can contain in his mind all the libraries of the world. That is a possibility, one can remember so much, yet that will be only in the head.\nYour heart will not be moved by it, your being will not grow through it; hence I call it false, pseudo, untrue.\nTrue knowledge happens through meditation, not through any other way; there is no alternative to meditation. Meditation means discovering your being -- that is the first thing to be done. If we don't know ourselves what else can we know? If inside there is darkness what is the meaning of light on the outside?\nThe scientist knows nothing about himself and he knows so much about matter. What is the point of it all? If the knower does not know himself, what kind of a knower is he? Socrates is far more right when he says: the first thing is to know thyself then only are you moving in the right direction; then whatsoever you know will be really true. But begin with yourself.\nSo being here with me, being a sannyasin, simply means one thing, that is, being a meditator. And meditation can happen is thousands of ways: dancing it can happen, loving it can happen, singing it can happen. If the singer is lost in the song and the ego disappears it is meditation. If the lover is lost while making love suddenly there is meditation. If the musician is lost while making music it is meditation. When the dancer is no more and only the dance remains it is meditation.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nHence life can be used in every possible way to help meditation. Meditation does not mean just sitting for a few minutes or a few hours, repeating a certain stupid mantra. Meditation means making your life meditative. Cooking, washing, cleaning -- everything should be transformed into a meditativeness. Do it with such totality, do it so creatively, that you become absorbed in it And the moment you are absorbed in anything -- it may be just rubbing the floor or washing your\nclothes or taking a shower... The activity is irrelevant, the approach is the real thing.\nIf you are absorbed in it, totally in it here and now, it is meditation. And out of meditation arises true knowledge, wisdom -- wisdom which liberates, wisdom which transforms, wisdom which gives you a new sense of meaning, fulfilment, contentment.\nJust the Tip of the Iceberg Chapter #13\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"3854","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/just_the_tip_of_the_iceberg/part12/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/just_the_tip_of_the_iceberg/>Just The Tip Of The Iceberg</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>19 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;3854 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Just_The_Tip_Of_The_Iceberg/part12.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part11>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

diary, which has been scanned and cleaned up. It is for reference
purposes only.]</p><p>(Osho talked about the meaning of the word 'shunyam'. It means
nothingness, and it is a tremendously positive state.)</p><p>It simply means space is there without any content. But the space is
very positive, in fact more than it was when it was too full of things
-- past, desires, memories, imaginings, expectations. These are the
contents of your inner world. We are full of these, and they are so many
that they don't leave any space for ourselves to be. We are very much
overcrowded.</p><p>This is the real problem, how to disperse this crowd. And this crowd
does not believe in birth control; it is a very Indian crowd. Each
thought goes on generating thousands of thoughts, each desire goes on
giving birth to many more</p><p>desires, each dream brings thousands of dreams in its wake. So the
inner world goes on becoming more and more crowded, more and more
clumsy, more and more chaotic.</p><p>The child comes with pure silence. His slate is empty. It has a
grace, a beauty, the music of silence. But we start stuffing each child
with religious ideology, political ideology. We start poisoning each
child with an ambition. We create desires in him, we create competition
in him, we create imitativeness in him. We tell him, "Look, you have to
be this, you have to be the president or the prime minister of the
country, you have to be the richest man."</p><p>That must have been the desire of your parents when they gave you the
name, Max; Max means the greatest. Every parent wants his child to be
the greatest, an Alexander the Great. Each parent is living his
unfulfilled desires through his children. He has not been able to fulfil
his desires. Nobody has ever been able to fulfil their desires because
desire as such is unfulfillable. Nothing can be done about it; it is not
in the nature of things, it is not the law of life.</p><p>To be full of desires simply means to await thousands of
frustrations, failures. Desires bring only frustration. They create
great expectation, and when they fall apart -- and they are bound to
fall apart sooner or later -- one is disillusioned. And one has carried
the illusion for so long and has become so attached to it that one feels
lost. Whenever a desire gets frustrated one is wounded. And those wounds
go on accumulating.</p><p>Each child comes into the world healthy and whole and we immediately
start wounding him. Up to now humanity has existed in a very wrong way.
Something basically, fundamentally, is wrong. Our whole education is
ambitious, it is political; our religions are political. Maybe they are
the politics of the beyond, but they are politics. You have to reach
heaven, you have to be a great achiever there in the other world
too.</p><p>Nobody says to just be empty of all content, because in that
emptiness, in that nothingness, flowers the ultimate</p><p>If one is ready to become a nobody then one becomes the greatest --
that is the meaning of Max. So I am giving you a paradoxical name. Be
nothing then you are all, be nobody then you attain to tremendous
extraordinariness. Just be empty and you will come to know the greatest
in you, the highest in you. But</p><p>remember, don't be nothing to become the greatest because then you
cannot be nothing. To be nothing is not to be used as a means to be the
greatest. It cannot be a means, it is an end unto itself. The greatness
is a by-product, not the goal, not the end.</p><p>It is like a fragrance. The flower is the end, the flowering of your
consciousness is all, and then suddenly there is fragrance. If you
search for fragrance you will miss the flower, and without the flower
there is no fragrance. If you search for the flower the fragrance comes
of its own accord.</p><p>Hence the really great are not Alexanders, the really great are
Jesus, Buddha, Lao Tzu. They were very simple people, with no desire to
be anybody in particular -- humble. Jesus says "Blessed are the meek for
theirs is the kingdom of god." That's exactly the meaning of your name.
That statement is paradoxical: the most blessed are the meek, for theirs
is the kingdom of god.</p><p>If one is meek, humble, nobody, then the doors of the kingdom open,
then you are a divine guest. Then suddenly you are raised to the highest
pinnacle of life. But that is a by-product. To attain the kingdom of god
is not a goal. Forget all about it -- just be nothing.</p><p>This is my whole teaching here, just to be a nobody. Just go on
throwing out all the rotten furniture from inside your being and become
utterly spacious. And that space is very overflowing, overflowing with
your 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on

can open its petals, it can become a thousand-petalled lotus. And then
there is great dance inside and great music and great poetry and great
beauty and grace. Then the whole imprisoned splendour is released
because there is no barrier to hinder it.</p><p>You become expansive. Life becomes an explosion of light, of love, of
bliss.</p><p>(And love is another way of learning to be a nobody, Osho went on to
say.) Love is nothing but the disappearance of the dewdrop into the
ocean. It is losing one's</p><p>ego, it is total surrender to existence. It is meeting with the
whole, it is dropping your boundaries and your identity. It is
abandoning yourself. The moment you abandon yourself, immediately you
become oceanic, vast.</p><p>We are clinging to our identity. We protect it, we fight for it, we
are even ready to die for it. And this is just stupidity because the ego
is the most false thing in existence. It is just hot air, it has no real
existence. It is like darkness.</p><p>You can see darkness, every day you see it, but it has no existence
as such. It is simply absence of light</p><p>-- nothing in itself, just an absence of light. Bring the light in
and you don't find any darkness, and you never even see it going out of
the door. Put the light off and it is suddenly there. It does not come
in; you can keep the doors and windows closed. It comes from nowhere
because it is non -- existential, it is just absence. It does not come
and go. Light comes and goes because light is.</p><p>The same is true about our ego. Ego is absence of love. The moment
you bring the light of love in, ego disappears. You need not do anything
else for the ego; just become more loving, unconditionally loving.</p><p>Love is not to be addressed to somebody in particular, just be loving
-- that has to be your quality. It has nothing to do with relationship.
Love has to be like fragrance. Whether anybody comes to know of it or
not, does not matter to the flower. Even in the farthest Himalayas,
where nobody comes and goes, thousands of flowers bloom and spread their
fragrance.</p><p>In the Himalayas there is a whole valley of very strange flowers.
People have only seen it from the peaks, nobody has been able to reach
it because it is dangerous to go down into that valley. People know
about those flowers but nobody has smelled their perfume; and they have
very psychedelic colours. They are far away, but they are not worried at
all about that; the flowers are perfectly happy.</p><p>Love has to be just your quality. Become loving, and one day it
happens that you are simply love; not even loving but love. That is the
day of great revelation. In that very moment the dewdrop disappears into
the ocean and becomes the ocean.</p><p>In religious terminology, in religious jargon, it has been called
god-realisation. If one likes religious jargon one can use that word,
otherwise it is far more</p><p>beautiful to say that one becomes oceanic; it is far more poetic.
priests have contaminated the word "god" too much and they have been
quarrelling around the word "god" for so many centuries that the very
word immediately raises a thousand and one questions. It simply creates
more and more arguments and controversies. But the word in itself was
beautiful when used for the first time; it simply represented the
beyond, the vast beyond.</p><p>Now it does not represent the beyond any more. Even the beyond has
been exploited by priests. Priests are the most cunning people. They
have made god a Christian god, a Hindu god, a Mohammedan god. Now
nothing more absurd can be done, it is the ultimate in absurdity. God
cannot be Hindu or Jewish or Buddhist. God simply means vastness, and to
make vastness Christian is to make it small. Any adjective will make it
limited. God has to be without any adjective. It simply means the
infinite existence, the unbounded. And love will give you the first
taste of it.</p><p>Just a drop of the nectar is enough to transform one. Once you have
tasted love you will automatically drop all that is against love -- all
hatred, anger, jealousy, all violence. One cannot carry them any more
because they are your enemies. One cannot go on nourishing them. One
simply drops them out of the understanding that arises with love, that
love brings in.</p><p>All these things -- violence, hatred, anger, jealousy, possessiveness
-- are part of darkness. So bring in the light of love. That's the
purpose of sannyas.</p><p>(Don't be part of the crowd -- either the internal one we call the
mind, nor the outer that is society.</p><p>Having touched on the former earlier in the evening Osho turned to
the subject of society versus the seer.) Meditation is the greatest
rebellion in the world. It is not ordinary revolution. Revolution has a
political colour to it. Revolution is of the crowds rebellion is of the
individual.</p><p>Revolution is of necessity political, because a crowd means politics.
The communist revolution or the socialist revolution or the fascist
revolution -- Russian, French, Chinese -- it does not matter what kind

the crowd is there. And being part of a crowd means that you are
functioning at the lowest level of intelligence.</p><p>To control the crowd, to be appealing to the crowd, to convince the
crowd, you have to come down very low. You have to come down to where
the crowd is. You have to speak their language. They understand
violence, they understand murder. The crowd consists of collective
stupidity, hence all revolutions are murderous, violent, unintelligent.
But the crowd has a power of its own because ninety-nine per cent of the
people are in it.</p><p>The rebel stands alone -- that's the beauty of it. A Buddha, a
Zarathustra, a Jesus</p><p>-- these are rebels, not revolutionaries. Karl Marx, Engels, Lenin,
Mao, Stalin, Hitler, Gandhi -- these are revolutionaries. They have to
go with the crowd, only then will the crowd go with them.</p><p>A rebel does not bother about whether anybody comes with him or not.
He cannot compromise on any account; he cannot come down from his
heights. He gives a call, certainly, to everybody who is receptive, but
he remains on the peak. He is the ultimate peak of intelligence.</p><p>Meditation means the purest intelligence, uncontaminated
intelligence, pure intelligence -- not intellectuality. Intellectuality
is a totally different matter. You can become an intellectual by going
to university, visiting the British Museum and going to the libraries
and studying scriptures. You can become an intellectual; meditation is
not needed for intellect. And the intellectual goes on collecting
rubbish. He becomes a great rubbish-collector; his mind is just a
junkyard, and everything is borrowed.</p><p>Intelligence has nothing to do with the outside, with borrowing from
the Vedas or the Bible or the Koran</p><p>-- no. It is discovering one's own inner sources. It is discovering
one's own centre. That's what meditation is all about: a discovery of
one's own centre. And the moment you know who you are, there is a great
explosion of intelligence.</p><p>Buddha is not an intellectual, neither is Jesus nor is Lao Tzu, but
they are tremendously intelligent. They have the clearest insight into
things, a direct</p><p>insight, an immediate insight. They don't go via anything, their eyes
are unclouded. There is no smoke in their mind, their flames are without
any smoke</p><p>-- flames of intelligence with no smoke. Hence wherever they look,
wherever their light falls, they can see exactly what is, they know what
is.</p><p>Meditation is sharpening your intelligence, and this sharpening
happens through silence. Thoughts make the intellectual; no-thought is
the way to attain intelligence.</p><p>Thinking is of the head, of the mind, and the state of no-mind is the
beginning of a totally new dimension in you when all thoughts cease and
there is simple silence as if a full stop has come. Nothing moves,
everything has stopped. Time has stopped; one is simply in the present.
In that tremendous moment</p><p>-- because it is the most alive moment of your life -- you discover
yourself. And that brings a rebellion to your being. You are another
person totally. You are reborn. You are no more the same old person --
the old dies. You are not even continuous with the old. It is not that
the old has become refined, the old has simply evaporated.</p><p>You are a totally new person, a discontinuous phenomenon. With this
aliveness whatsoever a person does, whatsoever he says, he is bound to
be rebellious. Very few people will be able to understand him. The
masses cannot understand. They will be against him, they have always
been against meditators. They have been afraid of people like Jesus and
Socrates and Mansoor. They have killed them for the simple reason that
they could not digest their vision, they could not accept that somebody
could be on such a height. To accept somebody on such a height means to
accept that you are living in darkness. It is humiliating.</p><p>The mobs took revenge. They felt insulted; that's how the stupid
person functions, behaves. When there is a man like Jesus, only the very
few people who have a little bit of intelligence, who can see what he
is, who can hear and understand, who have a little love and trust, who
can go with him into the beyond, who can understand his message... They
are bound to be very few. Rare people will be with a person like
Jesus.</p><p>The masses, whether Jews or Hindus or Mohammedans, it does not matter
-- will feel humiliated, insulted. And the only way to regain their ego
is to destroy such a person, to remove him from the scene, because his
very presence makes them</p><p>feel guilty that they have not been doing what they should be doing,
that they are not what they should be. His presence reminds them that
they have missed the opportunity of life -- and they cannot forgive
him.</p><p>They can worship him when he is gone but when he is alive they cannot
forgive him. And because they cannot forgive him when he is alive, they
are bound to worship him when he is gone. They will destroy the person
themselves and then they will feel guilty again, a new guilt will arise.
All these religions are born out of guilt.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>The Jews killed Jesus and then started feeling guilty about what they
had done. They looked at their hands and they were red with the blood of
an innocent person -- and they started feeling shaken. Now the only way
was to repent, worship. Worship is just a way to get rid of guilt. A
very strange world this is: first you kill a person, then you worship
him.</p><p>The cross even became part of their worship; the cross is worshipped.
Even after two thousand years we have not forgotten the guilt; somehow
everybody feels that we have been part of that conspiracy. Judas was not
alone. Judas felt so guilty that the next day, within twenty-four hours,
he committed suicide. But the whole of humanity has somehow felt that
had a part in it -- even <em>now</em>, although we were not present when
Jesus was killed and Socrates was poisoned and Buddha was stoned. We
were not there. But we know that if a man like Buddha or a man like
Jesus is here, we will do the same; hence the guilt. To cover the guilt
we worship them. Worship is not religious, it is out of a guilty
conscience.</p><p>The intelligent person loves such people when they are alive. The
unintelligent hates such people when they are alive, it tries to destroy
such people when they are alive and when they are gone, it worships
them.</p><p>The intelligent, when such people are gone, do not worship, there is
no need; there is no guilt. When they are gone, they are gone. He
searches again to see if</p><p>there is somebody else who can help him. The intelligent person never
becomes a Christian or a Hindu or a Mohammedan, he always tries to find
an alive master</p><p>-- because a dead master is no more there. Remember this: the stupid
worships the dead and the intelligent searches for the alive. Initiation
is possible only through an alive master. How can the dead help?</p><p>You can worship them but no help is going to come.</p><p>With meditation your intelligence will start functioning -- it is
dormant. And it will bring a rebellion, first in you and then it starts
spreading and radiating to others. It is like wildfire.</p><p>That's why I have chosen the colour of fire for my sannyasins, all
the shades of fire -- I want to spread this fire all over the earth. Let
this fire reach to every heart that is capable of transformation. Let
the whole world go through a rebellion. It needs it; in fact it should
have happened by now. We are already late. The morning has gone, the
afternoon has gone. It has already become evening, the sun is almost
ready to set.</p><p>Any day the third world war, could end the whole thing. It is time to
hurry and to transform oneself and to help others to be
transformed.'</p><p>(Unless truth happens to you, it's a lie; and the only way to allow
that happening is meditation. But that covers all sorts of activities,
Osho explained to the last sannyasin.) Knowledge can be untrue if it is
borrowed, then it is only pseudo. It appears to be knowledge but because
it has not happened to you it has no meaning at all. You are simply full
of words, theories, but they are all empty. Unless something is your own
authentic experience it never becomes true, it remains untrue.</p><p>What Jesus says you can repeat, you can repeat it in exactly the same
words. You can learn the language that Jesus spoke, Aramaic, and you can
speak Aramaic. You can repeat the exact words but they won't have any
meaning because you don't have a Christ-consciousness behind them.</p><p>Unless one becomes a Christ one's words cannot have the same meaning
as Jesus'. Unless one becomes a Buddha one cannot understand what this
man is saying. Yes, words will be heard, and one can go on accumulating
words in one's memory system. We have an immense memory system; in fact
no computer has yet been evolved which can compete with our memory
system.</p><p>It is said that a single memory system, a single man of average
intelligence, can contain in his mind all the libraries of the world.
That is a possibility, one can remember so much, yet that will be only
in the head.</p><p>Your heart will not be moved by it, your being will not grow through
it; hence I call it false, pseudo, untrue.</p><p>True knowledge happens through meditation, not through any other way;
there is no alternative to meditation. Meditation means discovering your
being -- that is the first thing to be done. If we don't know ourselves
what else can we know? If inside there is darkness what is the meaning
of light on the outside?</p><p>The scientist knows nothing about himself and he knows so much about
matter. What is the point of it all? If the knower does not know
himself, what kind of a knower is he? Socrates is far more right when he
says: the first thing is to know thyself then only are you moving in the
right direction; then whatsoever you know will be really true. But begin
with yourself.</p><p>So being here with me, being a sannyasin, simply means one thing,
that is, being a meditator. And meditation can happen is thousands of
ways: dancing it can happen, loving it can happen, singing it can
happen. If the singer is lost in the song and the ego disappears it is
meditation. If the lover is lost while making love suddenly there is
meditation. If the musician is lost while making music it is meditation.
When the dancer is no more and only the dance remains it is
meditation.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-4>Osho's books on

Meditation does not mean just sitting for a few minutes or a few hours,
repeating a certain stupid mantra. Meditation means making your life
meditative. Cooking, washing, cleaning -- everything should be
transformed into a meditativeness. Do it with such totality, do it so
creatively, that you become absorbed in it And the moment you are
absorbed in anything -- it may be just rubbing the floor or washing
your</p><p>clothes or taking a shower... The activity is irrelevant, the
approach is the real thing.</p><p>If you are absorbed in it, totally in it here and now, it is
meditation. And out of meditation arises true knowledge, wisdom --
wisdom which liberates, wisdom which transforms, wisdom which gives you
a new sense of meaning, fulfilment, contentment.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:justify id=just-the-tip-of-the-iceberg>Just the Tip of the Iceberg</h3><p>Chapter #13</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part11>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

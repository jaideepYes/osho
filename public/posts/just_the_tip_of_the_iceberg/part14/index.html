The first in the line-up was Teresa who bore the modest description of mother on the darshan list.) Meditation is a state of total relaxation; not of concentration, not of contemplation, but of relaxation.\nWhen one is so absolutely relaxed that there is no tension either in the body or in the mind, then suddenly there is an opening of the heart. Only in total relaxation does the heart open, it becomes a flower. Without its opening one remains unfulfilled, discontented.\nThe opening of the heart as a flower is the ultimate ecstasy; there is nothing more than that. One has come to the highest peak, one's life has blossomed. And that is the meaning of Teresa. Teresa means a reaper, a harvester.\nWhen one has come to the blossoming, the flowering, the ripening, then one can reap the crop. Then life is tremendously significant, a gift of god. Otherwise it is just a possibility, and nobody can be blissful with only a possibility. It has to become actual, it has to become a realisation.\nBeing with me means only one thing: learning how to relax. The moment you\nrelax you are in the present. The past is a tension. Relaxation is going beyond time -- no past, no future. One simply disappears into the infinity of the now and the here. And that is springtime as far as the inner ripening, flowering, is concerned.\n(The next for sannyas was Katja, an optician from Germany.) It is only through meditation that one can arrive at spotless purity because when all the content of the mind is dropped, when there is nothing inside -- no thought, no desire, no memory, no imagination -- when the whole traffic of the mind has come to a full stop, in that gap, in that interval, for the first time you know what it means to be pure, what it means to be virgin, because you have reached virgin territory within yourself. You have never been there. You penetrate to your innermost core for the first time. Then purity explodes.\nPurity is not attained through morality -- never. Morality really makes a person very impure. On the surface it gives the appearance of purity, but because it is repressive all that has disappeared from the surface becomes part of your unconscious. You become more impure than the so-called immoral person.\nThe immoral person is not as impure as the so-called religious, moral person, the saint -- who live through repression. The immoral person goes on throwing all his impurity out, he does not accumulate it.\nHe is far more innocent than your so-called saints. The sinner is far more innocent because he has not 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\naccumulated, and the saint is simply accumulating.\nSo whenever the saint explodes it is a volcanic explosion. The sinner cannot explode that way. He has no repressed dirt in him, he has always been throwing it out in instalments; when he was angry he was angry. But the saint goes on accumulating anger. When anger becomes accumulated then one is constantly in rage. Then one does not need any reason to be angry, one is simply angry. But that anger is inside, it becomes part of your blood stream, of your very marrow.\nHence the saints look so sad, so controlled, so uptight. The sinner is relaxed.\nIf one has to choose between the so-called saint and the sinner, it is better to be a sinner, because at least he is human and not so uptight. It is one of the important facts to be learned from history, that sinners have changed into real saints within seconds because they don't have much to throw out. Any moment, if they come in contact with a man like Jesus or Buddha, their life is transformed.\nThat's how Mary Magdalene the prostitute was transformed by Jesus. One great murderer, Angulimal, who killed nine hundred and ninety-nine persons, became immediately transformed as he looked into Buddha's eyes. But the so-called saint is not so easily transformed. It is very difficult for saints to enter heaven. They are so egoistic and full of bullshit. Of course it is holy bullshit. Morality, purity, is all just imposed.\nMeditation gives you freedom from being a sinner and from being a so-called saint too. It really creates a pure sky within you. It is better to say that it simply discovers that which is already there, it simply uncovers it.\nSo learn meditation while you are here. That single word is enough. It is a key, a master key.\n(He reminded the librarian who followed next that not only was Christ not a Christian, but that if you are a Christian you don't stand a chance of being a Christ.)\nBuddha was not a Buddhist. If you are a Buddhist you will never be a Buddha. And the same is true about all the masters, all the awakened ones: they don't have any isms, they don't have any dogma, they are not confined to any creed. They are free spirits, absolutely free. No church, no temple, is large enough to contain them; they belong to the infinity, they are infinite. But this is a tragedy from which the whole of humanity is suffering: somebody has become a Christian, somebody has become a Jew, somebody has become a Hindu, somebody has become a Buddhist, somebody has become a Mohammedan and so on, so forth. And they are all in a very schizophrenic state. It is bound to happen. A Christian cannot be anything but schizophrenic. And the same is true about all other so-called religious people, because you are trying to impose something upon yourself which has not grown within you.\nWhat Christ says is his own experience and what the Christian says is his belief.\nAnd the distance between experience and belief is vast. It is unbridgeable.\nNever be a believer if you want to know the truth. I am not saying become a disbeliever, because that is again a belief -- a negative belief, anti-belief.\nSo there are Christians -- they are clinging to a belief -- and there are people like Friedrich Nietzsche who used to sign his name \"Anti-Christ, Friedrich Nietzsche.\" Now that is going to another extreme. Why should you sign your name Anti-Christ? Somebody is Christian, somebody is anti-Christian, but both are confined, one in a positive way, another in a negative way.\nMy effort here is to give you freedom from both kinds of beliefs -- the positive and the negative -- so that you can explore on your own.\nThe truth is as available to you as to any Jesus, any Buddha, any Krishna. It is nobody's property, it is everybody's birthright. One should explore it, one should go into it. Rather than believing one should go with an open mind. Belief closes you. You are already living with a conclusion which is not yours, which is given by others, which is really accidental. If you were brought up by a Hindu you would have been a Hindu, if you were brought up by a Mohammedan you would have been a Mohammedan. So it is just a question of conditioning, of who your conditioners were, of what kind of people you were accidentally born to. They have conditioned your mind. Their minds were conditioned by their parents, and so on, so forth.\nCome out of all conditioning, become free, so that you can explore, so that you can enquire. A man who already has a conclusion becomes incapable of enquiry. The first requirement of enquiry is to drop all a priori conclusions and then one day you can experience.\nAnd the day you experience you become a Christ, you become a Buddha on your own -- and that has beauty. Christ is beautiful but a Christian is ugly.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\n(To Rosemarie, a German lawyer, Osho spoke of meditation as being a state of no-mind.) Meditation is equivalent to a state of no-mind.\nThe state of no-mind means agnosia, that \"I know nothing.\" What Socrates says is exactly the meaning of no-mind, agnosia. He says \"I know only one thing, that I know nothing.\" All knowledge dropped, one immediately becomes free of all kinds of imprisonments, because knowledge is borrowed and anything borrowed creates a bondage.\nTruth has to be one's own, not borrowed. It has to be born to you, you cannot adopt it. But people are doing that everywhere. If a woman cannot give birth to a child she adopts a child, hopefully believing that this will make her a mother. But unless you carry a child in your womb for nine months you cannot be a mother. You may pretend you are, you may believe you are, you may deceive others and yourself too, but you have not earned it. And deep do, you know that the child is not yours.\nHow can you forget that, that the child is not yours? Those nine months when the child is in the womb are significant because the mother and the child live in deep harmony -- no separation, a deep unity. The child breathes through the mother, pulsates in the same rhythm as the mother, he goes on hearing the heartbeat of the mother.\nPsychologists say that it is because the child hears the heartbeat of the mother that music gives us so much enchantment. Without that... If a child is brought up in a freezer -- and sooner or later they are going to do that -- that child will not have any desire for music, he will not have any sense of rhythm. He will be cold, utterly cold. He will not have any warmth, he has not known the mother's womb. He will be almost inhuman, because the child continuously changes with the mother's moods. And it is not one-way traffic either. The mother changes with the child's mood; it is a constant exchange. Those nine months, the pain, the heaviness, the sacrifice, are a must, otherwise the mother will miss something.\nThe same is true about truth: you have to mother it, you cannot adopt it.\nMeditation simply means dropping all that is adopted so that you can become free to know that which is within you.\nAnd Rosemarie means dew of the sea. A drop of water contains the whole sea, so if we can understand a single drop we will be able to understand the whole\nvast world of oceans because we can discover the formula of H2O from a single drop of water. Each man is a dewdrop of god. He belongs to the oceanic, to the vast, to the infinite. If we could understand ourselves we would be able to understand god too. And there is no other way to understand god, categorically there is no other way. The only way is through you.\nIf you can decode your innermost core -- it is just a dewdrop, but if you can understand it in its totality --\nyou have discovered god already. By knowing this dewdrop you know the whole sea. And then it is so easy for the dewdrop to drop into the sea and disappear into the sea. All fear disappears. The moment we know that we belong to the ultimate then there is no fear, no insecurity, no danger. We can drop our identity, we can drop our ego. That's what sannyas is all about, surrendering the ego.\nAnd once you surrender the ego all misery is gone, all nightmares are gone, all darkness is gone. One is full of light and love and bliss.\n(In the post-office worker's name, Prem Dieter, was the reminder that only love can be just.) Without love one is bound to be unjust. Love cannot be unjust -- that is impossible -- because love means compassion, love means consideration of the other. Love cannot use the other as a means.\nTo use the other as a means is the only immoral thing in existence. The moment you respect the other as an end unto himself love has arisen in you. Love cannot exploit, cannot oppress, cannot dominate.\nJustice comes almost like a shadow, it follows love, it is a by-product of meditation; it is a chain. But everything begins with meditation. Meditation triggers many processes in you, it opens many dimensions in you. One of those dimensions is love, and love is followed by justice, friendliness towards all. And prayerfulness -- not to any god in particular but there is a kind of gratitude towards existence.\nA man who knows what love is, is a blessing to himself and to others too.\n(While we search outside for that which is actually our intrinsic nature we are never going to find bliss, Osho told a handicraft teacher.)\nThe more you search for it on the outside, the more disillusioned you become,\nthe more disappointed, the more depressed. Life goes on slipping through your fingers. And as life starts slipping slowly slowly out of your hands and you have not found anything, obviously you feel very miserable, cheated. One starts feeling angry towards existence, angry towards god.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nAnd our century is very angry towards god. People may say so, they may not say so, but because there is so much misery how can they forgive god and how can they feel grateful? For what? For all this insanity, for all these wars, for all these murders and violence? Life seems to be absolutely meaningless, just a long series of frustrations. And the reason is that you are looking in the wrong direction.\nGod is not the cause of it It is futile to be angry with god. That's what my sannyasins have to understand\n-- that if you are miserable, except for yourself nobody is responsible.\nAnd the basic thing is that you have not looked in. The intelligent person will first look in. If it is not found there then he will go everywhere else. But those who have looked in have always found it without any exception. It is just waiting for you to come in, it is your very being.\nSannyas is an inner journey, it has no outer goal. One has to come to one's source, one has to disappear into oneself. And once you have reached your very source, your very roots, you are transformed. Then you can live on the outside, you have to live on the outside. Then there is nothing wrong because you will be radiating joy, you will be constantly in touch with your inner core. Amidst all the hustle and bustle of life you will remain calm and quiet and blissful. Nothing can disturb you, nothing can distract you. That's what real mastery is.\nJesus calls it the kingdom of god and he insists again and again that it is within you.\n(Osho gave the name Veet Rago to a German primal therapist. It means going beyond attachment -- and that is the soil in which love blossoms, he said.)\nAttachment, clinging, possessiveness are like rocks, hindering the path of your inner spring. But these are big rocks and they go on becoming bigger with every day. As time passes, the rocks go on becoming heavier and heavier.\nThe child knows, without knowing, what love is. Without being aware of what love is he knows, he knows love. Of course he does not know that he knows. That's the difference between a sage and a child.\nThe child knows love but knows not what love is; the sage knows love and also knows that he knows. That is the only difference, otherwise the sage has become a child again.\nSannyas has to be a second birth. And all that you have accumulated around the idea of attachment, clinging, possessiveness, domination, has to be dropped. These are the poisons.\nLove people but love unconditionally. Love people but don't expect anything in return. Love people for the sheer joy of loving. And don't bother about whether tomorrow the same is going to continue or not.\nDon't sacrifice today for any tomorrow because tomorrow exists not. Don't try to make your love permanent in any way because love is not plastic, it cannot be permanent. It is like a rose flower: it opens in the morning and in the evening the petals disappear. Tomorrow there will be another rose and the day after tomorrow, another rose. Roses will go on coming, but there is no need to cling to this rose. That is stupidity.\nIf you cling to this rose you may destroy even the possibility of another rose coming on your rose bush tomorrow, because you will be constantly pouring your energy around that which is no more.\nIt is really sad to see people when their love dies and they go on clinging -- very sad -- because now nothing can come out of it any more, but they go on hoping against all hope. It is a sheer wastage of energy.\nBut we have been taught for centuries that love is permanent if it is real -- and that is nonsense.\nIf it is real it cannot be permanent. If it is unreal maybe it can be permanent. Reality is momentary, it changes, it is a constant flux. You cannot step in the same river twice. It is a river, constantly moving.\nA lover has to be aware of this dynamic process of life, so he loves but he is not worried about the past or the future. If the next moment the flower is still flowering, the perfume is still there, good. If it has gone, then say goodbye and move, with no complaint, with no grudge, with no anger, with no sadness, because once you understand the nature of life you will not have any of these problems.\nAnd then love goes on growing in you. Lovers may change but the river of love goes on becoming bigger and bigger. Or they may not change. I am not saying to change them, I am simply saying if it changes, accept it with joy. If it does not change, accept that too with joy. That is non-attachment, that is love without attachment. Whatsoever happens one is blissful about it, one is thankful for it, one is always grateful for it.\nThen slowly slowly love is no more a relationship, it becomes a state of your being -- you are simply love. And that is how it should be. When one is love, one is god.\n(Her new name, Veet Tanha, means going beyond desire, Osho told the computer programmer from England, the last for sannyas.)\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\n\"Tanha\" is a word used by Gautam the Buddha. His whole message is contained in going beyond desire.\nIt does not matter what the desire is. If it is money that is desired or power or prestige or love, freedom, truth, god -- it doesn't matter. Whatsoever you desire you create trouble for yourself. Trouble arises around desiring.\nThe moment you desire you have brought the future in, you have lost contact with the present. Desire can never be of the present, remember, and life is of the present, hence life and desire never meet. Desire is in the mind and mind lives in the future -- in fantasy, in imagination, in dreams. And all dreams are going to be broken sooner or later. They are dreams, they are not realities. And desire is dreaming.\nLive in the moment -- that means live without desire. Live now, and now does not have enough space for desire. It has space enough for you but not for your mind.\nThe moment you live herenow all problems disappear. We create problems through desiring. First, the moment you start desiring something there is anxiety, tension about how it has to be fulfilled. Great thinking goes around and around: how to fulfil it? Then you start trying in every possible way to fulfil it.\nNow, there are only two possibilities: either you fulfil it or you don't. If you fulfil it then there is frustration because you attain the goal of desire but you miss. You miss the thing that you thought was going to happen through it. You were longing for a beautiful palace and after twenty years of working hard and earning money the palace is there.\nBut inside the palace you are the same person. Do you think a palace can make you blissful if you have been in misery for twenty years? It is impossible. The palace cannot change you; you will be miserable in the palace. You were miserable in your small house, you will be miserable in a bigger house, in fact more miserable because there will be more space, more room.\nIf you achieve the desire there is frustration. Of course if you don't achieve it there is frustration. Both alternatives bring frustration.\nThe man of understanding, seeing that whatsoever you do... if you succeed you fail, if you fail you fail, goes beyond desire.\nYou have heard the saying that nothing succeeds like success. That is sheer nonsense. I say to you that nothing fails like success. But millions of people will not agree with me because they have not succeeded in anything so they go on hoping that once they are successful all will be settled. Only very few people become successful, only those very few people know that success brings nothing to you. But by the time they succeed they have devoted their whole life to\nsuccess and now they are very embarrassed to confess the truth, that they have been fools. So they go on pretending and smiling as if they have really succeeded and all their desire is fulfilled and they are happy. But that is sheer deception; they are not ready to accept that they have been foolish, that their whole life has gone down the drain. Now at the end of their life they cannot confess it.\nBut a few rare individuals have confessed. Alexander the Great confessed that his life had been in vain\n-- and he was one of the most successful persons in the world. But he confessed at the very last moment when the doctors said that now he could not be alive for more than a few hours -- not even twenty -- four hours, just a few hours. He wanted to be alive for at least twenty-four hours because he was just twenty-four hours away from the capital. He was returning from India to Greece and he had promised his mother that he would come back. Just twenty-four hours away but he could not reach home.\nHe was ready to give his whole kingdom -- and that consisted in those days of the whole world, the whole known world -- but the doctors said, \"We cannot do anything, even if you give us the whole kingdom for which you have wasted your whole life.\" He didn't live long, he only lived for thirty-three years. He died exactly at the age that Jesus died. But he died on a bigger cross because he succeeded. He died with a golden crown.\nWe can understand Jesus -- he dies with a crown of thorns. But he dies with a deep contentment, with a relaxed being, knowing perfectly well that he is simply disappearing into god, that he is coming home; he has found the door to his home. But Alexander dies frustrated, very frustrated.\nBuddha renounced his kingdom. Seeing the misery of his father, just before he was going to succeed him, he escaped. He must have been of tremendous intelligence -- he was only twenty-seven when he left his kingdom. His father was becoming old and he was ready to give him the kingdom and he wanted to retire. The father wanted to retire, the son escaped, because he had seen his father and his misery; \"If that is going to happen to me too... My father's life is wasted and mine will also be wasted.\" He escaped just a single day before, before the crowning ceremony. The invitations were sent -- he left his father in a very embarrassing situation. The invitations had to be cancelled immediately\nbecause the son had escaped. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nNobody had ever heard of such a thing! But he understood that it was futile, it was not of any significance to be there in that palace with that kingdom. He had seen through and through; he must have had very clear eyes.\nHe went beyond all desire. First he went into the forest with a desire to find truth or god. After six years of constant effort he dropped that too, because he again understood: \"I am the same person: first I desired a kingdom, money, power, prestige, then I saw the futility of that.

Chuang Tzu Auditorium</h3><p>Archive code: 8009145 ShortTitle: ICEBRG14 Audio:</p><p>No Video:</p><p>No</p><p>[NOTE: This is an unedited tape transcript of an unpublished darshan
diary, which has been scanned and cleaned up. It is for reference
purposes only.]</p><p>(There were eight people tonight and between them quite an assortment
of professions. The first in the line-up was Teresa who bore the modest
description of mother on the darshan list.) Meditation is a state of
total relaxation; not of concentration, not of contemplation, but of
relaxation.</p><p>When one is so absolutely relaxed that there is no tension either in
the body or in the mind, then suddenly there is an opening of the heart.
Only in total relaxation does the heart open, it becomes a flower.
Without its opening one remains unfulfilled, discontented.</p><p>The opening of the heart as a flower is the ultimate ecstasy; there
is nothing more than that. One has come to the highest peak, one's life
has blossomed. And that is the meaning of Teresa. Teresa means a reaper,
a harvester.</p><p>When one has come to the blossoming, the flowering, the ripening,
then one can reap the crop. Then life is tremendously significant, a
gift of god. Otherwise it is just a possibility, and nobody can be
blissful with only a possibility. It has to become actual, it has to
become a realisation.</p><p>Being with me means only one thing: learning how to relax. The moment
you</p><p>relax you are in the present. The past is a tension. Relaxation is
going beyond time -- no past, no future. One simply disappears into the
infinity of the now and the here. And that is springtime as far as the
inner ripening, flowering, is concerned.</p><p>(The next for sannyas was Katja, an optician from Germany.) It is
only through meditation that one can arrive at spotless purity because
when all the content of the mind is dropped, when there is nothing
inside -- no thought, no desire, no memory, no imagination -- when the
whole traffic of the mind has come to a full stop, in that gap, in that
interval, for the first time you know what it means to be pure, what it
means to be virgin, because you have reached virgin territory within
yourself. You have never been there. You penetrate to your innermost
core for the first time. Then purity explodes.</p><p>Purity is not attained through morality -- never. Morality really
makes a person very impure. On the surface it gives the appearance of
purity, but because it is repressive all that has disappeared from the
surface becomes part of your unconscious. You become more impure than
the so-called immoral person.</p><p>The immoral person is not as impure as the so-called religious, moral
person, the saint -- who live through repression. The immoral person
goes on throwing all his impurity out, he does not accumulate it.</p><p>He is far more innocent than your so-called saints. The sinner is far
more innocent because he has not 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>accumulated, and the saint is simply accumulating.</p><p>So whenever the saint explodes it is a volcanic explosion. The sinner
cannot explode that way. He has no repressed dirt in him, he has always
been throwing it out in instalments; when he was angry he was angry. But
the saint goes on accumulating anger. When anger becomes accumulated
then one is constantly in rage. Then one does not need any reason to be
angry, one is simply angry. But that anger is inside, it becomes part of
your blood stream, of your very marrow.</p><p>Hence the saints look so sad, so controlled, so uptight. The sinner
is relaxed.</p><p>If one has to choose between the so-called saint and the sinner, it
is better to be a sinner, because at least he is human and not so
uptight. It is one of the important facts to be learned from history,
that sinners have changed into real saints within seconds because they
don't have much to throw out. Any moment, if they come in contact with a
man like Jesus or Buddha, their life is transformed.</p><p>That's how Mary Magdalene the prostitute was transformed by Jesus.
One great murderer, Angulimal, who killed nine hundred and ninety-nine
persons, became immediately transformed as he looked into Buddha's eyes.
But the so-called saint is not so easily transformed. It is very
difficult for saints to enter heaven. They are so egoistic and full of
bullshit. Of course it is holy bullshit. Morality, purity, is all just
imposed.</p><p>Meditation gives you freedom from being a sinner and from being a
so-called saint too. It really creates a pure sky within you. It is
better to say that it simply discovers that which is already there, it
simply uncovers it.</p><p>So learn meditation while you are here. That single word is enough.
It is a key, a master key.</p><p>(He reminded the librarian who followed next that not only was Christ
not a Christian, but that if you are a Christian you don't stand a
chance of being a Christ.)</p><p>Buddha was not a Buddhist. If you are a Buddhist you will never be a
Buddha. And the same is true about all the masters, all the awakened
ones: they don't have any isms, they don't have any dogma, they are not
confined to any creed. They are free spirits, absolutely free. No
church, no temple, is large enough to contain them; they belong to the
infinity, they are infinite. But this is a tragedy from which the whole
of humanity is suffering: somebody has become a Christian, somebody has
become a Jew, somebody has become a Hindu, somebody has become a
Buddhist, somebody has become a Mohammedan and so on, so forth. And they
are all in a very schizophrenic state. It is bound to happen. A
Christian cannot be anything but schizophrenic. And the same is true
about all other so-called religious people, because you are trying to
impose something upon yourself which has not grown within you.</p><p>What Christ says is his own experience and what the Christian says is
his belief.</p><p>And the distance between experience and belief is vast. It is
unbridgeable.</p><p>Never be a believer if you want to know the truth. I am not saying
become a disbeliever, because that is again a belief -- a negative
belief, anti-belief.</p><p>So there are Christians -- they are clinging to a belief -- and there
are people like Friedrich Nietzsche who used to sign his name
"Anti-Christ, Friedrich Nietzsche." Now that is going to another
extreme. Why should you sign your name Anti-Christ? Somebody is
Christian, somebody is anti-Christian, but both are confined, one in a
positive way, another in a negative way.</p><p>My effort here is to give you freedom from both kinds of beliefs --
the positive and the negative -- so that you can explore on your
own.</p><p>The truth is as available to you as to any Jesus, any Buddha, any
Krishna. It is nobody's property, it is everybody's birthright. One
should explore it, one should go into it. Rather than believing one
should go with an open mind. Belief closes you. You are already living
with a conclusion which is not yours, which is given by others, which is
really accidental. If you were brought up by a Hindu you would have been
a Hindu, if you were brought up by a Mohammedan you would have been a
Mohammedan. So it is just a question of conditioning, of who your
conditioners were, of what kind of people you were accidentally born to.
They have conditioned your mind. Their minds were conditioned by their
parents, and so on, so forth.</p><p>Come out of all conditioning, become free, so that you can explore,
so that you can enquire. A man who already has a conclusion becomes
incapable of enquiry. The first requirement of enquiry is to drop all a
priori conclusions and then one day you can experience.</p><p>And the day you experience you become a Christ, you become a Buddha
on your own -- and that has beauty. Christ is beautiful but a Christian
is ugly.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>(To Rosemarie, a German lawyer, Osho spoke of meditation as being a
state of no-mind.) Meditation is equivalent to a state of no-mind.</p><p>The state of no-mind means agnosia, that "I know nothing." What
Socrates says is exactly the meaning of no-mind, agnosia. He says "I
know only one thing, that I know nothing." All knowledge dropped, one
immediately becomes free of all kinds of imprisonments, because
knowledge is borrowed and anything borrowed creates a bondage.</p><p>Truth has to be one's own, not borrowed. It has to be born to you,
you cannot adopt it. But people are doing that everywhere. If a woman
cannot give birth to a child she adopts a child, hopefully believing
that this will make her a mother. But unless you carry a child in your
womb for nine months you cannot be a mother. You may pretend you are,
you may believe you are, you may deceive others and yourself too, but
you have not earned it. And deep do, you know that the child is not
yours.</p><p>How can you forget that, that the child is not yours? Those nine
months when the child is in the womb are significant because the mother
and the child live in deep harmony -- no separation, a deep unity. The
child breathes through the mother, pulsates in the same rhythm as the
mother, he goes on hearing the heartbeat of the mother.</p><p>Psychologists say that it is because the child hears the heartbeat of
the mother that music gives us so much enchantment. Without that... If a
child is brought up in a freezer -- and sooner or later they are going
to do that -- that child will not have any desire for music, he will not
have any sense of rhythm. He will be cold, utterly cold. He will not
have any warmth, he has not known the mother's womb. He will be almost
inhuman, because the child continuously changes with the mother's moods.
And it is not one-way traffic either. The mother changes with the
child's mood; it is a constant exchange. Those nine months, the pain,
the heaviness, the sacrifice, are a must, otherwise the mother will miss
something.</p><p>The same is true about truth: you have to mother it, you cannot adopt
it.</p><p>Meditation simply means dropping all that is adopted so that you can
become free to know that which is within you.</p><p>And Rosemarie means dew of the sea. A drop of water contains the
whole sea, so if we can understand a single drop we will be able to
understand the whole</p><p>vast world of oceans because we can discover the formula of H2O from
a single drop of water. Each man is a dewdrop of god. He belongs to the
oceanic, to the vast, to the infinite. If we could understand ourselves
we would be able to understand god too. And there is no other way to
understand god, categorically there is no other way. The only way is
through you.</p><p>If you can decode your innermost core -- it is just a dewdrop, but if
you can understand it in its totality --</p><p>you have discovered god already. By knowing this dewdrop you know the
whole sea. And then it is so easy for the dewdrop to drop into the sea
and disappear into the sea. All fear disappears. The moment we know that
we belong to the ultimate then there is no fear, no insecurity, no
danger. We can drop our identity, we can drop our ego. That's what
sannyas is all about, surrendering the ego.</p><p>And once you surrender the ego all misery is gone, all nightmares are
gone, all darkness is gone. One is full of light and love and bliss.</p><p>(In the post-office worker's name, Prem Dieter, was the reminder that
only love can be just.) Without love one is bound to be unjust. Love
cannot be unjust -- that is impossible -- because love means compassion,
love means consideration of the other. Love cannot use the other as a
means.</p><p>To use the other as a means is the only immoral thing in existence.
The moment you respect the other as an end unto himself love has arisen
in you. Love cannot exploit, cannot oppress, cannot dominate.</p><p>Justice comes almost like a shadow, it follows love, it is a
by-product of meditation; it is a chain. But everything begins with
meditation. Meditation triggers many processes in you, it opens many
dimensions in you. One of those dimensions is love, and love is followed
by justice, friendliness towards all. And prayerfulness -- not to any
god in particular but there is a kind of gratitude towards
existence.</p><p>A man who knows what love is, is a blessing to himself and to others
too.</p><p>(While we search outside for that which is actually our intrinsic
nature we are never going to find bliss, Osho told a handicraft
teacher.)</p><p>The more you search for it on the outside, the more disillusioned you
become,</p><p>the more disappointed, the more depressed. Life goes on slipping
through your fingers. And as life starts slipping slowly slowly out of
your hands and you have not found anything, obviously you feel very
miserable, cheated. One starts feeling angry towards existence, angry
towards god.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>And our century is very angry towards god. People may say so, they
may not say so, but because there is so much misery how can they forgive
god and how can they feel grateful? For what? For all this insanity, for
all these wars, for all these murders and violence? Life seems to be
absolutely meaningless, just a long series of frustrations. And the
reason is that you are looking in the wrong direction.</p><p>God is not the cause of it It is futile to be angry with god. That's
what my sannyasins have to understand</p><p>-- that if you are miserable, except for yourself nobody is
responsible.</p><p>And the basic thing is that you have not looked in. The intelligent
person will first look in. If it is not found there then he will go
everywhere else. But those who have looked in have always found it
without any exception. It is just waiting for you to come in, it is your
very being.</p><p>Sannyas is an inner journey, it has no outer goal. One has to come to
one's source, one has to disappear into oneself. And once you have
reached your very source, your very roots, you are transformed. Then you
can live on the outside, you <em>have</em> to live on the outside. Then
there is nothing wrong because you will be radiating joy, you will be
constantly in touch with your inner core. Amidst all the hustle and
bustle of life you will remain calm and quiet and blissful. Nothing can
disturb you, nothing can distract you. That's what real mastery is.</p><p>Jesus calls it the kingdom of god and he insists again and again that
it is within you.</p><p>(Osho gave the name Veet Rago to a German primal therapist. It means
going beyond attachment -- and that is the soil in which love blossoms,
he said.)</p><p>Attachment, clinging, possessiveness are like rocks, hindering the
path of your inner spring. But these are big rocks and they go on
becoming bigger with every day. As time passes, the rocks go on becoming
heavier and heavier.</p><p>The child knows, without knowing, what love is. Without being aware
of what love is he knows, he knows love. Of course he does not know that
he knows. That's the difference between a sage and a child.</p><p>The child knows love but knows not what love is; the sage knows love
and also knows that he knows. That is the only difference, otherwise the
sage has become a child again.</p><p>Sannyas has to be a second birth. And all that you have accumulated
around the idea of attachment, clinging, possessiveness, domination, has
to be dropped. These are the poisons.</p><p>Love people but love unconditionally. Love people but don't expect
anything in return. Love people for the sheer joy of loving. And don't
bother about whether tomorrow the same is going to continue or not.</p><p>Don't sacrifice today for any tomorrow because tomorrow exists not.
Don't try to make your love permanent in any way because love is not
plastic, it cannot be permanent. It is like a rose flower: it opens in
the morning and in the evening the petals disappear. Tomorrow there will
be another rose and the day after tomorrow, another rose. Roses will go
on coming, but there is no need to cling to <em>this</em> rose. That is
stupidity.</p><p>If you cling to this rose you may destroy even the possibility of
another rose coming on your rose bush tomorrow, because you will be
constantly pouring your energy around that which is no more.</p><p>It is really sad to see people when their love dies and they go on
clinging -- very sad -- because now nothing can come out of it any more,
but they go on hoping against all hope. It is a sheer wastage of
energy.</p><p>But we have been taught for centuries that love is permanent if it is
real -- and that is nonsense.</p><p>If it is real it cannot be permanent. If it is unreal maybe it can be
permanent. Reality is momentary, it changes, it is a constant flux. You
cannot step in the same river twice. It is a river, constantly
moving.</p><p>A lover has to be aware of this dynamic process of life, so he loves
but he is not worried about the past or the future. If the next moment
the flower is still flowering, the perfume is still there, good. If it
has gone, then say goodbye and move, with no complaint, with no grudge,
with no anger, with no sadness, because once you understand the nature
of life you will not have any of these problems.</p><p>And then love goes on growing in you. Lovers may change but the river
of love goes on becoming bigger and bigger. Or they may not change. I am
not saying to change them, I am simply saying if it changes, accept it
with joy. If it does not change, accept that too with joy. That is
non-attachment, that is love without attachment. Whatsoever happens one
is blissful about it, one is thankful for it, one is always grateful for
it.</p><p>Then slowly slowly love is no more a relationship, it becomes a state
of your being -- you are simply love. And that is how it should be. When
one is love, one is god.</p><p>(Her new name, Veet Tanha, means going beyond desire, Osho told the
computer programmer from England, the last for sannyas.)</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>"Tanha" is a word used by Gautam the Buddha. His whole message is
contained in going beyond desire.</p><p>It does not matter what the desire is. If it is money that is desired
or power or prestige or love, freedom, truth, god -- it doesn't matter.
Whatsoever you desire you create trouble for yourself. Trouble arises
around desiring.</p><p>The moment you desire you have brought the future in, you have lost
contact with the present. Desire can never be of the present, remember,
and life is of the present, hence life and desire never meet. Desire is
in the mind and mind lives in the future -- in fantasy, in imagination,
in dreams. And all dreams are going to be broken sooner or later. They
are dreams, they are not realities. And desire is dreaming.</p><p>Live in the moment -- that means live without desire. Live now, and
now does not have enough space for desire. It has space enough for you
but not for your mind.</p><p>The moment you live herenow all problems disappear. We create
problems through desiring. First, the moment you start desiring
something there is anxiety, tension about how it has to be fulfilled.
Great thinking goes around and around: how to fulfil it? Then you start
trying in every possible way to fulfil it.</p><p>Now, there are only two possibilities: either you fulfil it or you
don't. If you fulfil it then there is frustration because you attain the
goal of desire but you miss. You miss the thing that you thought was
going to happen through it. You were longing for a beautiful palace and
after twenty years of working hard and earning money the palace is
there.</p><p>But inside the palace you are the same person. Do you think a palace
can make you blissful if you have been in misery for twenty years? It is
impossible. The palace cannot change you; you will be miserable in the
palace. You were miserable in your small house, you will be miserable in
a bigger house, in fact more miserable because there will be more space,
more room.</p><p>If you achieve the desire there is frustration. Of course if you
don't achieve it there is frustration. Both alternatives bring
frustration.</p><p>The man of understanding, seeing that whatsoever you do... if you
succeed you fail, if you fail you fail, goes beyond desire.</p><p>You have heard the saying that nothing succeeds like success. That is
sheer nonsense. I say to you that nothing fails like success. But
millions of people will not agree with me because they have not
succeeded in anything so they go on hoping that once they are successful
all will be settled. Only very few people become successful, only those
very few people know that success brings nothing to you. But by the time
they succeed they have devoted their whole life to</p><p>success and now they are very embarrassed to confess the truth, that
they have been fools. So they go on pretending and smiling as if they
have really succeeded and all their desire is fulfilled and they are
happy. But that is sheer deception; they are not ready to accept that
they have been foolish, that their whole life has gone down the drain.
Now at the end of their life they cannot confess it.</p><p>But a few rare individuals have confessed. Alexander the Great
confessed that his life had been in vain</p><p>-- and he was one of the most successful persons in the world. But he
confessed at the very last moment when the doctors said that now he
could not be alive for more than a few hours -- not even twenty -- four
hours, just a few hours. He wanted to be alive for at least twenty-four
hours because he was just twenty-four hours away from the capital. He
was returning from India to Greece and he had promised his mother that
he would come back. Just twenty-four hours away but he could not reach
home.</p><p>He was ready to give his whole kingdom -- and that consisted in those
days of the whole world, the whole known world -- but the doctors said,
"We cannot do anything, even if you give us the whole kingdom for which
you have wasted your whole life." He didn't live long, he only lived for
thirty-three years. He died exactly at the age that Jesus died. But he
died on a bigger cross because he succeeded. He died with a golden
crown.</p><p>We can understand Jesus -- he dies with a crown of thorns. But he
dies with a deep contentment, with a relaxed being, knowing perfectly
well that he is simply disappearing into god, that he is coming home; he
has found the door to his home. But Alexander dies frustrated, very
frustrated.</p><p>Buddha renounced his kingdom. Seeing the misery of his father, just
before he was going to succeed him, he escaped. He must have been of
tremendous intelligence -- he was only twenty-seven when he left his
kingdom. His father was becoming old and he was ready to give him the
kingdom and he wanted to retire. The father wanted to retire, the son
escaped, because he had seen his father and his misery; "If that is
going to happen to me too... My father's life is wasted and mine will
also be wasted." He escaped just a single day before, before the
crowning ceremony. The invitations were sent -- he left his father in a
very embarrassing situation. The invitations had to be cancelled
immediately</p><p>because the son had escaped. 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-4>Osho's books on

futile, it was not of any significance to be there in that palace with
that kingdom. He had seen through and through; he must have had very
clear eyes.</p><p>He went beyond all desire. First he went into the forest with a
desire to find truth or god. After six years of constant effort he
dropped that too, because he again understood: "I am the same person:
first I desired a kingdom, money, power, prestige, then I saw the
futility of that. And for all these six years I desired truth, god,
liberation -- but desire is the same, desiring is the same. Only the
object has changed but I am the same person." Seeing it he dropped that

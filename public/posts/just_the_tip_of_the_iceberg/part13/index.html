It is for reference purposes only.]\n(Don't follow and imitate Christ, love and flower as Christ yourself, Osho told Veet Christiane.) Following is something wrong. The follower becomes an imitator. He becomes like a parrot. He starts repeating the master's words without attaining the consciousness that the master had.\nIt is beautiful to be a lover of Christ because love is vast; you can be a lover of Christ and at the same time a lover of Buddha and a lover of Lao Tzu and a lover of Zarathustra and a lover of me. Love is so vast that it can contain all the masters. But following is very narrow.\nThe follower of Christ cannot be a follower of Buddha, the follower of Buddha cannot be a follower of Christ. Following makes you limited. Why not inherit the whole earth? Why not inherit the whole history of consciousness? Why not include all the dimensions possible? Why exclude anybody? Because if you exclude anybody that much richness is lost.\nJesus says, \"My god's mansion has many doors, many doors. But people are so foolish that they cling to one door, they become confined to one room, to one church, to one ideology, to one dogma. That is sheer stupidity. So go beyond following.\nLove can make you a Christ one day. And only when you have tasted something of the consciousness of Christ, will you be able to understand Jesus, not before it. And that understanding will include all the masters -- Jewish, Hindu, Christian, Mohammedan, Jaina -- it will not exclude anybody.\nAnd that's my effort here. My sannyasins are not to be my followers, just lovers. Love has a dignity, a tremendous splendour, a beauty, because it gives freedom. Following is a bondage -- go beyond it.\n(And to another sannyasin Osho spoke along similar lines.) Let it be something of the past, your being a Christian. Cling to it no more. Die to the past so that you 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\ncan open in the present and you can allow the future to enter you.\nWe all live in the past. Somebody is born in a Christian family or in a Hindu family -- that is just an accident. You have not chosen to be a Christian, you have been forced to be a Christian. Somebody else is forced to be a Hindu, somebody else a Buddhist, somebody else a Mohammedan -- these are conditionings.\nYour parents have given you a certain conditioning, your society has given you a certain conditioning, and to live in that conditioning is to live the life of a prisoner. It is slavery, spiritual slavery.\nMy sannyasins have to be free of all kinds of slaveries. Freedom is my message, freedom from the whole structure that others have created for you, from all the shoulds and should-nots that others have giver to you. Unless you are free of that you will never be able to hear your own inner voice.\nYour parents will go on telling you, \"Do this, don't do that,\" even to the very last moment of your life.\nYour priests will go on nagging you, creating guilt in you; they will not allow you to be yourself. Nobody in this world is really interested in anybody being\ngiven the freedom to be himself or herself. Everybody is trying to impose his ideas on others. That's why we have created such a mess of a humanity, otherwise human beings can be immensely beautiful. We have created a very ugly lot, and the simple reason is that we have not allowed children to be themselves. We have crushed them from the very beginning, imposed structures on them.\nA certain wall surrounds everybody, a subtle, very invisible wall, so you are not even aware that the wall is there. It is a very transparent wall. You can see through it and it hangs around you. So you can move and you can think that you are free but you are not free. You are not imprisoned in a prison made of stones and bricks, you are imprisoned in a prison made of thoughts, concepts, theologies, philosophies. It is a very invisible thing and one has to get rid of it. When the whole sky is yours with all its stars, then the whole existence is yours.\nThat's exactly the teaching of all the masters -- Jesus, Buddha, Zarathustra. There is no difference, there cannot be. If truth is one, how can the teachings of those who have awakened to truth be different? Maybe languages are different, their metaphors are different, their parables are different, but different fingers can point to the same moon. Maybe somebody's fingers are long and somebody's are short and somebody's are white and somebody's are black -- that is immaterial.\nLook at what the fingers are pointing at, don't be bothered by the fingers. And you will be surprised: Buddha is indicating towards the same moon as Jesus, as Moses, as Lao Tzu. And the moment you realise this, who wants to be a Christian or a Hindu or a Mohammedan? Then one just wants to be freedom, awareness, love, bliss, celebration. And the moment you are free you will find Christ in you, Buddha in you, Lao Tzu in you, Moses in you -- all together! In that inner freedom and silence the whole heritage of humanity becomes yours. So don't cling to the past.\nThis is a second birth. The first birth has been missed because people tried to manipulate you. My effort here is to uncondition you and leave you totally free. I don't give you a reconditioning, I don't give you any ideology; I simply destroy whatsoever is surrounding you so that you are free. My work is negative because I know the truth is within you -- only your chains have to be broken and the truth will reveal itself. One need not look for it anywhere else. You are born with it, it is god's gift. It is already the case, it has not to be achieved -- we are it.!\n(Meditate and all else shall be added unto you -- that's been Osho's insistence. Peace and silence are among the 'all else' he told us tonight.)\nOne can be calm and silent in two ways. One way is very cheap but superficial too, easy to achieve but not worth achieving; that is, cultivating a certain quality of calmness around yourself just on the surface, making it an attribute of your character so even if there is turmoil within at least to the outside world you can appear calm and quiet. That's what people, as far as the majority is concerned, have been doing. They only cultivate a shallow superficial, not even skin-deep, calmness around themselves. Just scratch them a little bit and they lose their calmness. Any accident is enough and vou will see that they are childish, immature. Somebody insults them and all calmness is gone; they go bankrupt and all calmness is gone.\nThen you can see the child immediately taking possession of them; they go into a tantrum. They forget all about their character. They become angry, violent, they can murder, they can commit suicide -- these so-called calm ones.\nBut the society only wants you to be superficially calm. It is not interested much in your real transformation because it deals only with your outside, it has nothing to do with your inner. It has no interest in your inner world.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nReal calmness, authentic calmness, arises out of meditation -- not out of cultivating a character but out of awareness. Meditation means awareness. Becoming aware of your anger dissolves it and dissolves it from your very depths; it even disappears from your unconscious. Then you are really calms calm from the centre to the circumference. Your whole being is calm. Then nothing can disturb you, neither life nor death.\nNothing can disturb you.\nOnly when nothing can disturb you, when it becomes impossible to be disturbed,\nwhen even if you want to be disturbed you become incapable of it, then something really valuable has happened. It can happen only through awareness. It is not a question of practising a certain character, it is not a question of pretending. It is a question of inner mutation, a radical change, a change at the very core of your being. Then it radiates to your circumference too, it transforms the circumference automatically.\nOnce the centre is different you cannot have this old circumference around you. But vice versa is not true. You can paint the circumference with different colours\n-- that will not change your being. It will be only a painted face, a mask. That's how people are living, with masks. They are pretending everything. They pretend love and they have not tasted anything of love. They pretend religiousness; just by going to church every Sunday they thing they have become religious. It's not so easy; this Sunday religion is not religiousness. They can even pray every night before going to bed and every morning, or like Mohammedans they can pray five times a day. The same Mohammedans can kill, murder.\nThe religion of the Mohammedans is called Islam; Islam means peace, and Mohammedans have disturbed the peace of the world more than anybody else. Strange!\nChristians believe in Jesus and go on repeating his words, that \"God is love,\" but Christians have proved a calamity to the world. Just look at history, at what they have done. Thousands of people have been burned alive by them -- and god is love! They have murdered millions of people. \"Blessed are the meek for theirs is the kingdom of god\" -- and they have been the most arrogant people in the world. They have been trying to show to the world that the only right religion is Christianity -- and, \"Blessed are the meek, and blessed are the poor in spirit.\"\nPoor in spirit means a man without ego -- and Christians have been very egoistic. Declaring that Jesus is the only begotten son of god is not humbleness. Then what is Buddha? Then what is Zarathustra? And what is Mohammed and what is Krishna? All are wrong, only Jesus is right, and those who follow Jesus will go to heaven and those who don't follow will suffer in hell and will suffer for eternity. And these people say that to be humble, to be meek, to be poor in spirit is their religion, love is their religion.\nThe so-called religious are not religious. The Hindus go on talking about\nbeautiful things -- that god is in everyone, even in the rocks, in the trees, but god is not in the Christians, not in the Mohammedans, not in the Buddhists. In the rocks they can allow god, in the trees they can allow god, in the animals they can allow god, but not in Christians, not in Mohammedans. They are so intolerant and they preach tolerance. They say all religions are basically one, and they go on arguing that their religion is higher, greater, the only true religion. This is the approach of all the so-called religious people.\nOur love is false, our religiousness is false, our so-called truth is false because we use it only when it helps us in attaining something. Whenever it does not help we forget all about it and we start using lies. We preach honesty and at the same time we say honesty is the best policy; so we make honesty also just a policy, just politics. This is how humanity has lived up to now -- it has been a very pseudo kind of existence.\nMy sannyasins have to drop all pseudoness. About love, about bliss, about peace, about calm, they have to drop all falseness, they have to accept reality. If they are not peaceful it is better to be aware of it. If you are not loving it is better to be aware of it. If you are jealous it is better to be aware of it rather than repressing it, because the repressed will come up again and again.\nYou cannot get rid of anything by repression, and all morality is repressive; hence I don't teach morality, I only teach meditation. Out of meditation a morality comes like fragrance. When the rose opens there is fragrance, when the lotus opens there is fragrance. No need to care about fragrance; just take care of the flower, just open up. And in awareness one opens.\nBe aware and you will be surprised that whatsoever you become aware of, if it is wrong it evaporates, if it is right it becomes deeply rooted. This is the miracle of awareness. If you become aware of love it will not disappear; it will become deeper and deeper, it will attain new dimensions. If you become aware of hatred it will simply evaporate. The false cannot stand before awareness; the real becomes more clear in awareness.\nIt is as when you bring light in a dark room: darkness will disappear but the painting on the wall, the beautiful furniture in the room -- they will not disappear. In fact in darkness they were not there at all 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nbecause you could not see them. It made no difference whether there was a beautiful Van Gogh painting on the wall or not, it was all dark. In darkness it was almost as if absent. As you bring in light, even a small candle, the beauty of the painting suddenly explodes. Darkness disappears because darkness is false, but the painting cannot disappear; it is a reality.\nThe same is true about our inner world. Bring the light of awareness in and anger will disappear because it is false, hatred will disappear, jealousy will disappear, possessiveness will disappear, ego will disappear --\nthey are all false entities. Love will grow, bliss will grow, calmness will grow and for the first time your life will become authentic. And to be authentic is to be religious. To be true to your own self is to be religious.\nThat is the only real worship, the only real prayer. That is the only offering we can make to god -- our authenticity. Except for that everything is just a ritual -- empty, impotent.\n(You probably never thought of it like this, but it is always the new, never the old, that brings bliss.\nOsho explained his insight in detail.)\nMisery is always old and never new. It is one of the most fundamental factors to be understood: because misery is old and never new we cling to it. It is familiar, we are well-acquainted with it. We have lived with it so long that it is almost part of us and we are part of it And bliss seems to be a new territory -- unfamiliar, unknown. And the unknown always gives us fear, it scares us. Who knows what it is and where it will land us?\nHence people cling to misery. They suffer and they go on groaning and crying and weeping and they go on saying \"We want bliss.\" But whenever there is an opportunity to move into the world of bliss they close their eyes because they want bliss, but they want it in the old way, and bliss is always new and misery is always old.\nIf you choose the old, you choose misery; if you choose the new you choose bliss. Let this be a key: always choose the new, the unknown, the dangerous, the insecure, because it is only through risking that one grows. And growth is bliss, maturity is bliss.\nNever for a single moment cling to the old. Whatsoever is old go on dropping. The moment it is old, be finished with it, put a full stop by it. Never look back, there is nothing worth looking back at. One cannot look back, one has to go ahead, always ahead. And be adventurous. Sannyas means initiation into an inner adventure.\nIt is like climbing a virgin peak of a mountain -- dangerous, certainly, because nobody has travelled there before. Not even footprints are there, no maps exist, no directions; you will not find milestones on the way. You will have to grope, you will have to find your way. You will have to create your way by going towards the peak. And of course there are many dangers, but danger is always beautiful because it is through danger that we become alert, aware, conscious.\nWhen there is no danger one tends to fall asleep. When there is danger you cannot fall asleep. You cannot afford to be asleep, you have to be fully awake. When your house is on fire can you fall asleep? You may be tired, exhausted, everything, but you cannot fall asleep. When the house is on fire you will forget all about sleep.\nJust a moment before you were yawning and you were feeling tired, and suddenly a great rush of energy comes to you from some deeper source within you, from some reservoir, from some reserve energy, and you are very much alive, alert, as you are not ordinarily. In your mundane activities, repetitive activities, you need not be alert, aware; you can go on snoring and you can go on doing things. People are driving and they are asleep. People are doing all kinds of things but mechanically. There is no need to be aware.\nRisk and danger and insecurity make you aware. And awareness is the greatest value because through awareness everything else comes in -- love, joy, god, truth, liberation.\n(Last night Osho talked about the meaninglessness of a knowledge that isn't your own. But in his inimitable fashion he approached the subject with quite a different tack tonight.) Knowledge is futile because it is borrowed. Wisdom is of\nimmense value because it is your own discovery. Never go for knowledge; that is going astray -- go for wisdom. Knowledge is easily available. In the libraries you can find it, in the universities you can find it. Knowledge comes through studying; wisdom comes through meditation not through study. Knowledge comes through thinking and wisdom comes through non-thinking. One has to drop thinking and become utterly peaceful. When no thoughts disturb you, when the whole traffic of the mind stops, wisdom arises in you. It is your own inner source that explodes.\nWhen the heavy burden of the head is removed, when the rock of the mind is removed, the spring comes 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nalive. Then one lives in one's own light and to live in one's own light is to live truly. Then life has meaning and significance, otherwise life is a drag, a boredom.\nIt is a long long boredom, from the cradle to the grave, a tale told by an idiot, full of fury and noise, signifying nothing.\nDon't miss the opportunity that becomes available by becoming a sannyasin. The opportunity is that of meditation. Here the only thing to be learned is meditation. My whole emphasis, my categorical emphasis, is or meditation.\nIf you can learn how to be silent and aware you have learned everything worth learning. All else will follow, you need not bother about it; all else is just a by- product.\n(His address to the last sannyasin was an extension of the same theme.) Meditation is the most valuable ruby, a diamond, the most precious treasure. There is nothing compared to meditation. If you can know how to be meditative, the inner scripture becomes available to you.\nEverybody's life contains a scripture, a bible. The outside bible is not the real bible. The word \"bible\"\nmeans the book of the books. It is not the book of books, the book of books is within you; it cannot be outside.\nThe outside bible may have a few reflections of the inner, but they are only reflections. The moon reflected in the waters of the lake is not the real moon -- don't be deceived by it. Although it is a reflection of the real moon, so it has a certain resemblance to reality, don't be deceived by it and don't jump into the lake to find it, otherwise you may get drowned. And you are not going to find the moon in the lake; you will get into unnecessary trouble.\nPeople have jumped into lakes. Into the Bibles, into the Vedas, into the Gitas, into the Korans, they have jumped. These are just lakes, beautiful lakes, certainly, and capable of reflecting something of the real. But a reflection is a reflection. The face in the mirror is not your real face. Don't go on searching in the mirror for your real face. You will not find it there -- the mirror is empty. So is the lake, so are all the scriptures --\nempty. They are beautiful words but empty.\nUnless you find the inner scripture that is within you, you will not be able to understand the outer Bibles, Korans and Vedas. Once you have found the inner then there is a possibility; then doors open up, then suddenly there is a great opening. Whatsoever was closed and hidden becomes available, slowly the curtain is removed. You can see that which is. And once you have found it inside you will find it in the words of Jesus, in the words of Buddha, very easily.\nThe man who knows the real moon is bound to know the moon in the lake. He will understand and he may even rejoice because he is not deceived; he knows perfectly well it is a reflection but a beautiful reflection. Sometimes when the lake is utterly calm and quiet, when there is no disturbance on its surface, it becomes a mirror of tremendous beauty. One can enjoy the scriptures, but not before realizing the inner truth.\nSo I call meditation, the greatest treasure, the most precious ruby. If you have found it you have found all. So while you are here put all your energy into understanding matters of meditation. Find out the method that fits you, that you feel attuned with, that suddenly starts ringing bells in your heart. And then go on moving deeper and deeper into it. And be patient.\nMind will create all kinds of distractions, disturbances -- don't be worried, they\nare natural. But if you go on persisting, if you go on patiently digging inwards, sooner or later -- if your intensity is enough, if you are totally and passionately involved in meditation, it will be sooner rather than later -- the mind disappears.\nAnd the day the mind disappears and you are left without a mind, for the first time you know what it is to be. The beatitude of it, the benediction of it, the ecstasy of it, is simply incomprehensible; it cannot be communicated. One has to experience it -- there is no other way.\nMy effort here is to make every possible method available so nobody misses, so everybody can find the right method for himself. All the methods that have been tried, all the methods that have helped individuals to attain are available here. It is something rare, something that has never happened in the whole of history.\nBuddhists know only one method, Sufis know only one method, Christians know only one method, Hindus know only one method and here, all methods are available. This is a meeting place of all the great masters. A great merger is happening, a great synthesis is arising.\nSo put your whole energy into finding out which method suits you. Once you know, that one method simply goes deep in you without any effort, you have found the right track for you.\nAnd then god is not far away; it is just around the corner. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nJust the Tip of the Iceberg Chapter #14\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"4103","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/just_the_tip_of_the_iceberg/part13/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/just_the_tip_of_the_iceberg/>Just The Tip Of The Iceberg</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>20 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;4103 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Just_The_Tip_Of_The_Iceberg/part13.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part12>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

diary, which has been scanned and cleaned up. It is for reference
purposes only.]</p><p>(Don't follow and imitate Christ, love and flower as Christ yourself,
Osho told Veet Christiane.) Following is something wrong. The follower
becomes an imitator. He becomes like a parrot. He starts repeating the
master's words without attaining the consciousness that the master
had.</p><p>It is beautiful to be a lover of Christ because love is vast; you can
be a lover of Christ and at the same time a lover of Buddha and a lover
of Lao Tzu and a lover of Zarathustra and a lover of me. Love is so vast
that it can contain all the masters. But following is very narrow.</p><p>The follower of Christ cannot be a follower of Buddha, the follower
of Buddha cannot be a follower of Christ. Following makes you limited.
Why not inherit the whole earth? Why not inherit the whole history of
consciousness? Why not include all the dimensions possible? Why exclude
anybody? Because if you exclude anybody that much richness is lost.</p><p>Jesus says, "My god's mansion has many doors, many doors. But people
are so foolish that they cling to one door, they become confined to one
room, to one church, to one ideology, to one dogma. That is sheer
stupidity. So go beyond following.</p><p>Love can make you a Christ one day. And only when you have tasted
something of the consciousness of Christ, will you be able to understand
Jesus, not before it. And that understanding will include all the
masters -- Jewish, Hindu, Christian, Mohammedan, Jaina -- it will not
exclude anybody.</p><p>And that's my effort here. My sannyasins are not to be my followers,
just lovers. Love has a dignity, a tremendous splendour, a beauty,
because it gives freedom. Following is a bondage -- go beyond it.</p><p>(And to another sannyasin Osho spoke along similar lines.) Let it be
something of the past, your being a Christian. Cling to it no more. Die
to the past so that you 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished>Osho's books on

you.</p><p>We all live in the past. Somebody is born in a Christian family or in
a Hindu family -- that is just an accident. You have not chosen to be a
Christian, you have been forced to be a Christian. Somebody else is
forced to be a Hindu, somebody else a Buddhist, somebody else a
Mohammedan -- these are conditionings.</p><p>Your parents have given you a certain conditioning, your society has
given you a certain conditioning, and to live in that conditioning is to
live the life of a prisoner. It is slavery, spiritual slavery.</p><p>My sannyasins have to be free of all kinds of slaveries. Freedom is
my message, freedom from the whole structure that others have created
for you, from all the shoulds and should-nots that others have giver to
you. Unless you are free of that you will never be able to hear your own
inner voice.</p><p>Your parents will go on telling you, "Do this, don't do that," even
to the very last moment of your life.</p><p>Your priests will go on nagging you, creating guilt in you; they will
not allow you to be yourself. Nobody in this world is really interested
in anybody being</p><p>given the freedom to be himself or herself. Everybody is trying to
impose his ideas on others. That's why we have created such a mess of a
humanity, otherwise human beings can be immensely beautiful. We have
created a very ugly lot, and the simple reason is that we have not
allowed children to be themselves. We have crushed them from the very
beginning, imposed structures on them.</p><p>A certain wall surrounds everybody, a subtle, very invisible wall, so
you are not even aware that the wall is there. It is a very transparent
wall. You can see through it and it hangs around you. So you can move
and you can think that you are free but you are not free. You are not
imprisoned in a prison made of stones and bricks, you are imprisoned in
a prison made of thoughts, concepts, theologies, philosophies. It is a
very invisible thing and one has to get rid of it. When the whole sky is
yours with all its stars, then the whole existence is yours.</p><p>That's exactly the teaching of all the masters -- Jesus, Buddha,
Zarathustra. There is no difference, there cannot be. If truth is one,
how can the teachings of those who have awakened to truth be different?
Maybe languages are different, their metaphors are different, their
parables are different, but different fingers can point to the same
moon. Maybe somebody's fingers are long and somebody's are short and
somebody's are white and somebody's are black -- that is immaterial.</p><p>Look at what the fingers are pointing at, don't be bothered by the
fingers. And you will be surprised: Buddha is indicating towards the
same moon as Jesus, as Moses, as Lao Tzu. And the moment you realise
this, who wants to be a Christian or a Hindu or a Mohammedan? Then one
just wants to be freedom, awareness, love, bliss, celebration. And the
moment you are free you will find Christ in you, Buddha in you, Lao Tzu
in you, Moses in you -- all together! In that inner freedom and silence
the whole heritage of humanity becomes yours. So don't cling to the
past.</p><p>This is a second birth. The first birth has been missed because
people tried to manipulate you. My effort here is to uncondition you and
leave you totally free. I don't give you a reconditioning, I don't give
you any ideology; I simply destroy whatsoever is surrounding you so that
you are free. My work is negative because I know the truth is within you
-- only your chains have to be broken and the truth will reveal itself.
One need not look for it anywhere else. You are born with it, it is
god's gift. It is already the case, it has not to be achieved -- we
<em>are</em> it.!</p><p>(Meditate and all else shall be added unto you -- that's been Osho's
insistence. Peace and silence are among the 'all else' he told us
tonight.)</p><p>One can be calm and silent in two ways. One way is very cheap but
superficial too, easy to achieve but not worth achieving; that is,
cultivating a certain quality of calmness around yourself just on the
surface, making it an attribute of your character so even if there is
turmoil within at least to the outside world you can appear calm and
quiet. That's what people, as far as the majority is concerned, have
been doing. They only cultivate a shallow superficial, not even
skin-deep, calmness around themselves. Just scratch them a little bit
and they lose their calmness. Any accident is enough and vou will see
that they are childish, immature. Somebody insults them and all calmness
is gone; they go bankrupt and all calmness is gone.</p><p>Then you can see the child immediately taking possession of them;
they go into a tantrum. They forget all about their character. They
become angry, violent, they can murder, they can commit suicide -- these
so-called calm ones.</p><p>But the society only wants you to be superficially calm. It is not
interested much in your real transformation because it deals only with
your outside, it has nothing to do with your inner. It has no interest
in your inner world.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>Real calmness, authentic calmness, arises out of meditation -- not
out of cultivating a character but out of awareness. Meditation means
awareness. Becoming aware of your anger dissolves it and dissolves it
from your very depths; it even disappears from your unconscious. Then
you are really calms calm from the centre to the circumference. Your
whole being is calm. Then nothing can disturb you, neither life nor
death.</p><p>Nothing can disturb you.</p><p>Only when nothing can disturb you, when it becomes impossible to be
disturbed,</p><p>when even if you want to be disturbed you become incapable of it,
then something really valuable has happened. It can happen only through
awareness. It is not a question of practising a certain character, it is
not a question of pretending. It is a question of inner mutation, a
radical change, a change at the very core of your being. Then it
radiates to your circumference too, it transforms the circumference
automatically.</p><p>Once the centre is different you cannot have this old circumference
around you. But vice versa is not true. You can paint the circumference
with different colours</p><p>-- that will not change your being. It will be only a painted face, a
mask. That's how people are living, with masks. They are pretending
everything. They pretend love and they have not tasted anything of love.
They pretend religiousness; just by going to church every Sunday they
thing they have become religious. It's not so easy; this Sunday religion
is not religiousness. They can even pray every night before going to bed
and every morning, or like Mohammedans they can pray five times a day.
The same Mohammedans can kill, murder.</p><p>The religion of the Mohammedans is called Islam; Islam means peace,
and Mohammedans have disturbed the peace of the world more than anybody
else. Strange!</p><p>Christians believe in Jesus and go on repeating his words, that "God
is love," but Christians have proved a calamity to the world. Just look
at history, at what they have done. Thousands of people have been burned
alive by them -- and god is love! They have murdered millions of people.
"Blessed are the meek for theirs is the kingdom of god" -- and they have
been the most arrogant people in the world. They have been trying to
show to the world that the only right religion is Christianity -- and,
"Blessed are the meek, and blessed are the poor in spirit."</p><p>Poor in spirit means a man without ego -- and Christians have been
very egoistic. Declaring that Jesus is the only begotten son of god is
not humbleness. Then what is Buddha? Then what is Zarathustra? And what
is Mohammed and what is Krishna? All are wrong, only Jesus is right, and
those who follow Jesus will go to heaven and those who don't follow will
suffer in hell <em>and</em> will suffer for eternity. And these people
say that to be humble, to be meek, to be poor in spirit is their
religion, love is their religion.</p><p>The so-called religious are not religious. The Hindus go on talking
about</p><p>beautiful things -- that god is in everyone, even in the rocks, in
the trees, but god is not in the Christians, not in the Mohammedans, not
in the Buddhists. In the rocks they can allow god, in the trees they can
allow god, in the animals they can allow god, but not in Christians, not
in Mohammedans. They are so intolerant and they preach tolerance. They
say all religions are basically one, and they go on arguing that their
religion is higher, greater, the only true religion. This is the
approach of all the so-called religious people.</p><p>Our love is false, our religiousness is false, our so-called truth is
false because we use it only when it helps us in attaining something.
Whenever it does not help we forget all about it and we start using
lies. We preach honesty and at the same time we say honesty is the best
policy; so we make honesty also just a policy, just politics. This is
how humanity has lived up to now -- it has been a very pseudo kind of
existence.</p><p>My sannyasins have to drop all pseudoness. About love, about bliss,
about peace, about calm, they have to drop all falseness, they have to
accept reality. If they are not peaceful it is better to be aware of it.
If you are not loving it is better to be aware of it. If you are jealous
it is better to be aware of it rather than repressing it, because the
repressed will come up again and again.</p><p>You cannot get rid of anything by repression, and all morality is
repressive; hence I don't teach morality, I only teach meditation. Out
of meditation a morality comes like fragrance. When the rose opens there
is fragrance, when the lotus opens there is fragrance. No need to care
about fragrance; just take care of the flower, just open up. And in
awareness one opens.</p><p>Be aware and you will be surprised that whatsoever you become aware
of, if it is wrong it evaporates, if it is right it becomes deeply
rooted. This is the miracle of awareness. If you become aware of love it
will not disappear; it will become deeper and deeper, it will attain new
dimensions. If you become aware of hatred it will simply evaporate. The
false cannot stand before awareness; the real becomes more clear in
awareness.</p><p>It is as when you bring light in a dark room: darkness will disappear
but the painting on the wall, the beautiful furniture in the room --
they will not disappear. In fact in darkness they were not there at all
1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>because you could not see them. It made no difference whether there
was a beautiful Van Gogh painting on the wall or not, it was all dark.
In darkness it was almost as if absent. As you bring in light, even a
small candle, the beauty of the painting suddenly explodes. Darkness
disappears because darkness is false, but the painting cannot disappear;
it is a reality.</p><p>The same is true about our inner world. Bring the light of awareness
in and anger will disappear because it is false, hatred will disappear,
jealousy will disappear, possessiveness will disappear, ego will
disappear --</p><p>they are all false entities. Love will grow, bliss will grow,
calmness will grow and for the first time your life will become
authentic. And to be authentic is to be religious. To be true to your
own self is to be religious.</p><p>That is the only real worship, the only real prayer. That is the only
offering we can make to god -- our authenticity. Except for that
everything is just a ritual -- empty, impotent.</p><p>(You probably never thought of it like this, but it is always the
new, never the old, that brings bliss.</p><p>Osho explained his insight in detail.)</p><p>Misery is always old and never new. It is one of the most fundamental
factors to be understood: because misery is old and never new we cling
to it. It is familiar, we are well-acquainted with it. We have lived
with it so long that it is almost part of us and we are part of it And
bliss seems to be a new territory -- unfamiliar, unknown. And the
unknown always gives us fear, it scares us. Who knows what it is and
where it will land us?</p><p>Hence people cling to misery. They suffer and they go on groaning and
crying and weeping and they go on saying "We want bliss." But whenever
there is an opportunity to move into the world of bliss they close their
eyes because they want bliss, but they want it in the old way, and bliss
is always new and misery is always old.</p><p>If you choose the old, you choose misery; if you choose the new you
choose bliss. Let this be a key: always choose the new, the unknown, the
dangerous, the insecure, because it is only through risking that one
grows. And growth is bliss, maturity is bliss.</p><p>Never for a single moment cling to the old. Whatsoever is old go on
dropping. The moment it is old, be finished with it, put a full stop by
it. Never look back, there is nothing worth looking back at. One cannot
look back, one has to go ahead, always ahead. And be adventurous.
Sannyas means initiation into an inner adventure.</p><p>It is like climbing a virgin peak of a mountain -- dangerous,
certainly, because nobody has travelled there before. Not even
footprints are there, no maps exist, no directions; you will not find
milestones on the way. You will have to grope, you will have to find
your way. You will have to create your way by going towards the peak.
And of course there are many dangers, but danger is always beautiful
because it is through danger that we become alert, aware, conscious.</p><p>When there is no danger one tends to fall asleep. When there is
danger you cannot fall asleep. You cannot afford to be asleep, you have
to be fully awake. When your house is on fire can you fall asleep? You
may be tired, exhausted, everything, but you cannot fall asleep. When
the house is on fire you will forget all about sleep.</p><p>Just a moment before you were yawning and you were feeling tired, and
suddenly a great rush of energy comes to you from some deeper source
within you, from some reservoir, from some reserve energy, and you are
very much alive, alert, as you are not ordinarily. In your mundane
activities, repetitive activities, you need not be alert, aware; you can
go on snoring and you can go on doing things. People are driving and
they are asleep. People are doing all kinds of things but mechanically.
There is no need to be aware.</p><p>Risk and danger and insecurity make you aware. And awareness is the
greatest value because through awareness everything else comes in --
love, joy, god, truth, liberation.</p><p>(Last night Osho talked about the meaninglessness of a knowledge that
isn't your own. But in his inimitable fashion he approached the subject
with quite a different tack tonight.) Knowledge is futile because it is
borrowed. Wisdom is of</p><p>immense value because it is your own discovery. Never go for
knowledge; that is going astray -- go for wisdom. Knowledge is easily
available. In the libraries you can find it, in the universities you can
find it. Knowledge comes through studying; wisdom comes through
meditation not through study. Knowledge comes through thinking and
wisdom comes through non-thinking. One has to drop thinking and become
utterly peaceful. When no thoughts disturb you, when the whole traffic
of the mind stops, wisdom arises in you. It is your own inner source
that explodes.</p><p>When the heavy burden of the head is removed, when the rock of the
mind is removed, the spring comes 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>alive. Then one lives in one's own light and to live in one's own
light is to live truly. Then life has meaning and significance,
otherwise life is a drag, a boredom.</p><p>It is a long long boredom, from the cradle to the grave, a tale told
by an idiot, full of fury and noise, signifying nothing.</p><p>Don't miss the opportunity that becomes available by becoming a
sannyasin. The opportunity is that of meditation. Here the only thing to
be learned is meditation. My whole emphasis, my categorical emphasis, is
or meditation.</p><p>If you can learn how to be silent and aware you have learned
everything worth learning. All else will follow, you need not bother
about it; all else is just a by- product.</p><p>(His address to the last sannyasin was an extension of the same
theme.) Meditation is the most valuable ruby, a diamond, the most
precious treasure. There is nothing compared to meditation. If you can
know how to be meditative, the inner scripture becomes available to
you.</p><p>Everybody's life contains a scripture, a bible. The outside bible is
not the real bible. The word "bible"</p><p>means the book of the books. It is not the book of books, the book of
books is within you; it cannot be outside.</p><p>The outside bible may have a few reflections of the inner, but they
are only reflections. The moon reflected in the waters of the lake is
not the real moon -- don't be deceived by it. Although it is a
reflection of the real moon, so it has a certain resemblance to reality,
don't be deceived by it and don't jump into the lake to find it,
otherwise you may get drowned. And you are not going to find the moon in
the lake; you will get into unnecessary trouble.</p><p>People have jumped into lakes. Into the Bibles, into the Vedas, into
the Gitas, into the Korans, they have jumped. These are just lakes,
beautiful lakes, certainly, and capable of reflecting something of the
real. But a reflection is a reflection. The face in the mirror is not
your real face. Don't go on searching in the mirror for your real face.
You will not find it there -- the mirror is empty. So is the lake, so
are all the scriptures --</p><p>empty. They are beautiful words but empty.</p><p>Unless you find the inner scripture that is within you, you will not
be able to understand the outer Bibles, Korans and Vedas. Once you have
found the inner then there is a possibility; then doors open up, then
suddenly there is a great opening. Whatsoever was closed and hidden
becomes available, slowly the curtain is removed. You can see that which
is. And once you have found it inside you will find it in the words of
Jesus, in the words of Buddha, very easily.</p><p>The man who knows the real moon is bound to know the moon in the
lake. He will understand and he may even rejoice because he is not
deceived; he knows perfectly well it is a reflection but a beautiful
reflection. Sometimes when the lake is utterly calm and quiet, when
there is no disturbance on its surface, it becomes a mirror of
tremendous beauty. One can enjoy the scriptures, but not before
realizing the inner truth.</p><p>So I call meditation, the greatest treasure, the most precious ruby.
If you have found it you have found all. So while you are here put all
your energy into understanding matters of meditation. Find out the
method that fits you, that you feel attuned with, that suddenly starts
ringing bells in your heart. And then go on moving deeper and deeper
into it. And be patient.</p><p>Mind will create all kinds of distractions, disturbances -- don't be
worried, they</p><p>are natural. But if you go on persisting, if you go on patiently
digging inwards, sooner or later -- if your intensity is enough, if you
are totally and passionately involved in meditation, it will be sooner
rather than later -- the mind disappears.</p><p>And the day the mind disappears and you are left without a mind, for
the first time you know what it is to be. The beatitude of it, the
benediction of it, the ecstasy of it, is simply incomprehensible; it
cannot be communicated. One has to experience it -- there is no other
way.</p><p>My effort here is to make every possible method available so nobody
misses, so everybody can find the right method for himself. All the
methods that have been tried, all the methods that have helped
individuals to attain are available here. It is something rare,
something that has never happened in the whole of history.</p><p>Buddhists know only one method, Sufis know only one method,
Christians know only one method, Hindus know only one method and here,
all methods are available. This is a meeting place of all the great
masters. A great merger is happening, a great synthesis is arising.</p><p>So put your whole energy into finding out which method suits you.
Once you know, that one method simply goes deep in you without any
effort, you have found the right track for you.</p><p>And then god is not far away; it is just around the corner.

It is for reference purposes only.]\n(Osho began tonight on a note similar to the one on which he ended last night -- learning to listen to the inner whispering.)\nMan unnecessarily seeks for knowledge on the outside because the source of all wisdom is at the very core of your being. All that is needed is a deep silence to hear it, because the heart cannot shout, it only whispers. It cannot shout for the simple reason that it is not aggressive. Shouting is aggression, violence.\nThe mind is very aggressive, hence it is constantly shouting, making much fuss about everything, creating great noise. And because of this noise one cannot hear the still, small voice within. Once this noise ceases, when we have put the mind aside, suddenly the whisper comes so clearly that one cannot miss it.\nAnd because there is no mind one cannot misinterpret it either. It comes with such certainty, with such absolute.… Self-evident it is; it needs no proof, no argument. It is absolutely categorical. Once you have heard it you are bound to follow it. One will never go against it, one cannot. It is one of the fundamental laws of life.\nPeople go astray because they don't know where to look for real advice. In the\npast they used to go to the priests, now they have started going to the psychoanalist. The psychoanalyst is the new priest. Neither the priest nor the psychoanalyst know anything. The priest himself was in confusion, so is the psychoanalyst. In fact psychoanalysts go to each other to be psychoanalysed. They have their problems, they have not solved their problems either. They have their difficulties, their own mess. In fact they are in more of a mess than 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nanybody else, than any profession. No other profession commits so many suicides and no other profession goes insane as much as the psychoanalysts -- and they are trying to help people! They themselves are not healed.\nThe old proverb is absolutely pertinent about them, Physician first heal thyself. But their profession is very profitable, it always has been. The priest or the witchdoctor or the psychoanalyst -- they belong to the same chain, they exploit one thing in different names, that is, that people have forgotten to listen to their own hearts.\nMy effort here is to help you to find your own voice so that you don't need any other advice. I don't give you any advice, I don't try to solve your particular problems. My effort is totally radical; I simply help you to put the noise inside off so that you can hear your own voice. And then you cannot go wrong. Then you live in your own light. That is the way of a sannyasin.\nThe sannyasin is not a follower, the sannyasin is not an imitator. The sannyasin is one who has found his own soul, and now he lives accordingly.\n(He only wants drunkards and gamblers for company, Osho said, That's what you have to be if you want to love.)\nLove is when the rock of the ego is removed. Then your life's juices start flowing. That's what love is all about your life juices. And they come with such a flood that you start overflowing with them. You have to share. And when you share your love energy with anybody, it is not that you are obliging the other person, in fact, just the contrary is the case: you feel obliged to the other because\nhe accepted your love. You don't ask for anything in return because love in itself is such a joy, who cares for any reward?\nRewards are meant for purposes where the process itself is that of misery -- then a reward is needed. So the reward is like a carrot hanging in front of you and to get the carrot you can pass through all kinds of miseries. The Nobel Prize, the gold medals in universities, the presidencies, the prize minister-ships of the world -- these are just prizes. They are very childish because to hanker for a prize is childish, to ask for a reward is childish.\nThe really mature person lives in such a way that each moment in itself is a reward. It is not that the reward will be coming later on. The mature person has such an insight into things that the journey and the goal are no more separate, so each step of the journey is a goal in itself -- tremendously blissful, beautiful.\nwho cares about the goal? Every moment is such a benediction that one enjoys it as an end unto itself; it is not a means to anything.\nWhen a man has come to this state, when everything is an end unto itself, only then has he lived his life truly, he has become really grown-up. Growing old is not becoming grown-up. Growing old has nothing to do with you, it is not to your credit. Every donkey becomes old; it does not need any intelligence. But to be grown-up needs great intelligence, great courage, and a heart which is ready to risk, gamble.\nOne can be my sannyasin only if one is ready to gamble, if one is ready to risk without holding anything back. When one is ready to be totally committed, then only is some transformation possible. But it brings infinite grace, it brings celebration to your life. Flowers start showering on you, the whole existence rejoices in your joy.\n(Osho talked again tonight about how we can live either as lovers or logicians, and about how society has no use for the former so does all it can to harness the heart's energy in the service of the head.) The man of the heart has no market value. He has immense value in himself but that value is not of the market; he cannot become a commodity. When people are poor what till you do with poetry and music, what will you do with painting and sculpture? When people are ill what are you going to do with poet? It cannot feed, it cannot give shelter, it cannot help as medicine.\nSociety is not interested in the values of the heart, its whole interest is in tile head, so society forces every child to move towards the head. Of course every child basically wants to move towards the heart because that is a natural and spontaneous phenomenon. But we have to divert him. We have to punish him, reward him, we have to create fear and the idea of profit in him, we have to persuade him towards that which is practical and utilitarian: Become a doctor, forget all about dancing; become an engineer, forget all about poetry; become a mathematician, forget all about music -- those things are for mad people.\nAnd when you force the child and condition the child... and society has great powers to condition. The schools, the colleges, the universities -- they exist not for you, they exist for society, they serve society; they are agents of a particular establishment. And the whole process is a long process -- it is twenty-five years at 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nleast by the time you become a Ph.D.; that means one third of your life. But once you are conditioned you completely forget about the heart. You by-pass the heart. The heart remains at the side, you go directly to the head, your energy starts shooting directly to the head. This is the misery.\nI am not against science, not against mathematics. My observation is that there are people whose heart is in mathematics, then it is perfectly good. For example, Albert Einstein: his heart was in mathematics so it was not a head question for Albert Einstein, it was his love affair. But to force every child is ugly. It is a calamity, it is coercion, it is violence.\nJust think of a society where every child is forced to become a poet. It would be good for a Shakespeare, good for a Shelley or a Byron, but what about everybody else? If everybody has to be forced and trained to be a poet they will not be poets; their heart will not be in it. They will be just third-rate or even fourth-rate people, their whole life will be of misery.\nJust think of Albert Einstein being forced to become a poet, then you will understand what is happening.\nHe will never be a first-class poet -- that much is certain. He can be a first-class mathematician, he will be a fourth-rate poet, or even that may be difficult. He will remain miserable for his whole life. That is what is happening.\nIf your heart is in something then for you it is perfectly beautiful, but it has to be a natural phenomenon, a spontaneous urge. Then whatsoever it is you will rejoice, your heart will feel victorious, your life will have a splendour and glory and you will feel that your life has been of tremendous fulfilment.\nBut society exists in a kind of regimentation; everybody has to be forced into a certain thing. So for a few people it is good but for the majority it is destructive. To ninety-nine per-cent of people society is destructive, all societies are the same in that way. And we have not yet been able to create a society where everybody is given the opportunity to be himself or herself -- respected, valued and not forced to be somebody else.\nA sannyasin has to just be his or her own self, whatsoever the consequences, then even to live a poor life is very rich because your heart is in it. If your heart is not in it you may become the richest person in the world but you will be very poor because you will not rejoice in it. Just think of Albert Einstein becoming a Rockefeller; his heart will not be in it. Or Bernard Shaw becoming a Ford; his heart will not be in it. Or Picasso becoming Adolf Hitler; his heart will not be in it, he will be utterly miserable. A thousand and one times he will thing to commit suicide, and if he does not commit suicide he will go mad.\nEverybody has brought a certain duality with his birth and that quality has to grow. Meditation helps you to find your natural urge, your intuitive feel. Meditation simply means a state of no-thought, so there is no disturbance, so your inner world is completely empty and you can see and search for where your heart is.\nThe moment you have felt the heartbeat, the moment you have found your inner pulse, then you are on the right track. Then whatsoever you do will bring joy to you and ultimately god is yours. But it is only through the heart, never otherwise.\n(Osho said, If one enquires into love ultimately one finds god.) One should go on deeper and deeper into the phenomenon of love and at the ultimate core god will be found. But that is not to be made much of a concern, because once god\nbecomes your concern you start going astray because you start forgetting about love; you start thinking about god, believing in god, worshipping god. And that is all false because you don't know god at all.\nThe same is not true about love. You know something, everybody knows something about love. Love is a natural phenomenon. Of course it needs great refinement, it is very crude; it is like a raw diamond. But the diamond is there, you just have to become a little bit of a jeweller. You have to learn how to polish it, how to cut it, how to make it shine -- and that is not very difficult.\nOnce you have discovered the inner beauty of the diamond and you have cut away all that was unessential, you have found god. Love is like a raw diamond and god is a fully polished, cut, shining diamond. But your concern should be with love because the journey begins in love and ends in god, and you cannot begin at the end. That's where all the religions have gone wrong: they begin at the end -- how can you begin at the end? You have to begin from the very beginning.\nSo all religions have become theologies. Theology means logic about god. That is sheer stupidity, there is no logic about god. God is the most illogical phenomenon. It is as illogical as love. Is there any logic in love? You fall in love with somebody -- what logic is there? If somebody insists \"Why?\", you can only shrug your shoulders, that's all. You can only say it has happened; it is a happening, not a doing.\nIt is something bigger than you, hence it is incomprehensible. And it is not of the mind, it is of the heart, 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nso the mind knows nothing about it. The mind condemns it, the mind calls it falling in love. Mind the word\n\"falling\", it is a condemnatory word. The mind says you have fallen, you are no more in your senses, you have gone a little bit cuckoo. It is a condemnation. And all the languages of the world have such words, about this they all agree.\nI don't agree. I say rising in love, not falling in love, because the heart is a higher centre than the mind.\nOf course physiologically the mind seems to be at the top and the heart seems to be in the middle, a little below. It is only physiologically so. But the heart is at the innermost core because the most precious thing is always kept at the core, at the inner centre, and the head is on the periphery. Just think that way then the total evaluation changes; then the heart becomes the centre and the mind is just something on the periphery, on the circumference. And when you have great treasure you don't keep it outside, on the circumference of your house; you keep it hidden deep in the innermost chamber of your house.\nThe heart is your inner chamber where all that is beautiful and great is hidden. Jesus calls it the kingdom of god. It is within you. It has to be discovered -- not by logic.\nLogic is good for discovering things. It is good for scientific enquiry, it is absolutely impotent in subjective enquiry. For subjective enquiry you need a totally different method -- that is love. It is only through love that you will become aware of beauty, not through logic. It is only through love that you will become aware of bliss, not through logic. It is only through love that you will become aware of god, not through logic. All that is significant is discovered through love and all that is insignificant, mundane, is discovered by logic.\nLogic is good as far as it goes but it does not go far enough, it has a limitation. Love has no limitations.\nIt is as vast as the sky, or even vaster.\nI teach only one thing and that is love. Love unconditionally, love for the sheer joy of loving, for no other motive. Love people, love animals, love birds, love trees, rocks, stars. Don't miss any opportunity to love. Whatsoever is available shower your love on it, because the more you shower your love, the more love grows in you. The more you share, the more you have, the more you give, the more you have -- that's why I say it is a very illogical phenomenon.\nLogic will not agree with it. How can logic agree with the statement that the more you give, the more you have? It will say)of course you will have less. If you give)that much has to be deduced, you will have less. If you have ten rupees and you give away five you have only five left.\nLove is illogical. It says if you have ten rupees, give ten and you have twenty. And all the great masters are absolutely in agreement with it. It is meta- economics. It is something like a higher mathematics, not comprehensible by lower mathematics of the mind.\nTo enquire into love is the only purpose of life. Life is an opportunity to enquire into love. People go on accumulating money, power, prestige -- these are the fools. Death will knock at their door any moment and all their money and all their power and prestige will collapse. They came empty-handed and they will go empty-handed. Only a lover goes so full. He comes empty-handed but goes very full, overflowingly full.\nHis death is a celebration; his life is a celebration -- his death is the crescendo of his life.\nAt the moment of death when a man like Buddha or Jesus or Socrates dies, his death is the ultimate in sharing because this is his last moment on earth, his goodbye to existence. He gives totally and in that total giving he receives god as a guest.\nBuddha has used two words. When a person starts moving into the world of love, becomes loving, he calls it nirvana. The word \"nirvana\" means cessation of the ego -- and of course, when the ego ceases one becomes loving. And when such a person dies Buddha calls it mahaparinirvana, the great nirvana, because then he gives totally. We gives his body, his mind, his heart, his life -- he gives everything back to existence. He simply disappears into nothingness. His giving is absolute, nothing is retained. He simply evaporates, he is no more. He has not kept anything, not even himself; hence Buddha calls it the great cessation.\nThese are the two Moments which are the most valuable: the first is nirvana when you become loving and you start sharing and the ego disappears, and the second is the great nirvana -- that is when death comes; you give totally, nothing is left behind, not even a trace. And that is the moment when one becomes part of god or part of the whole. And to be part of the whole is the only way to be holy.\nTo be whole is to be holy. Except for love there is no way to attain to this infinity, to this eternity.\n(Bliss can't be boxes Osho told Anand Nirupama.)\nBliss has no form. It is not an object, it is an experience; hence science cannot verify it, science cannot 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\ncollect information about it.\nEvery scientist knows that there is something like bliss, something like love, something like beauty, but as long as he is a scientist he will deny them; he will say these are all fallacies, illusions, hallucinations. For him matter is the only reality, the object is the only reality; he denies subjectivity.\nIt is a very strange situation: the scientist denies himself, accepts the objects and never becomes aware that without a subject how can there be an object? Without a scientist how can there be science? But he cannot put himself into a test tube so he cannot verify it, he cannot examine it, he cannot dissect it.\nThe most unverifiable phenomenon is bliss. It is absolutely formless. You cannot catch hold of it. It i5\nlike fragrance. A flower you can catch hold of, so science studies the flower. But religion studies the fragrance, and the fragrance is the very purpose of the flower, the fragrance is its essential core, its truth, its celebration, its gift to existence. The flower exists for the fragrance, not vice versa.\nBliss is a fragrance but it can happen only if you become a flower, if you open up like a bud opening.\nThe bud contains fragrance but it remains hidden inside; unless the petals open the fragrance cannot be released.\nMeditation is just an effort to trigger the process of opening in you, so you are no more closed, so you start coming out, you start opening your doors and windows, you become available to the sun, to the moon, to the stars, to the wind, to the rain. You start becoming open to people, to all that surrounds you. When you are totally open life is bliss... But it is an experience and very formless. You\ncannot prove it, you cannot convince anybody of it, but you can experience it. And who bothers whether anybody is convinced or not?\nIf you have tasted of it there is no need to bother.\nOnce a very great logician came to see Ramakrishna and he argued very much against god, against truth, against bliss, and all that is inner. Ramakrishna laughed and enjoyed it. The logician started feeling a little bit embarrassed, obviously, because he thought that Ramakrishna would become sad because he could not argue and he could not answer him -- but he was rejoicing! He ashed \"What is the matter with you? Are you mad or something? -- because I am arguing against all your beliefs and you go on laughing!\"\nRamakrishna said \"You can argue but how can I deny my experience? You are simply showing that you have not experiences, that's all. And I am enjoying it, your arguments are beautiful, but they cannot convince me because I know and you don't know. Your arguments are clever and I am enjoying them, they are very intellectual and I appreciate them. But I cannot answer because what I have experienced is unarguable. And who cares about convincing you? In the first place it is not possible; even if it was possible, who bothers?\"\nThe man was immensely impressed. This was the first time he had found a man who could not be dislodged from his cent mind, from his grounding; no argument affected him. Ramakrishna said \"You make very convincing arguments and they can convince anybody who has not known. But what can I do? I am helpless: I have known it! You are like a blindman who is arguing against light. I can understand your arguments, why you are arguing -- because you don't have any eyes. And I am like a man who has eyes and who has seen the light and I know. I cannot argue about it, because you don't have any eyes.\n\"Only eyes can give you an experience of light, so if you want to learn,\" Ramakrishna said, \"what bliss is, you will have to be with me and drop these arguments. Just once taste something of it then you can argue.\"\nAnd this man, Keshavchandra Sen was his name -- one of the greatest logicians of the past century --\nbecame a disciple of Ramakrishna. The whole of Calcutta was shocked, they could not believe it, because Ramakrishna was absolutely uneducated, a villager, a very simple person, almost a simpleton. And Keshavchandra Sen's becoming a\ndisciple was very shocking news to the intelligentsia. They asked again and again \"Keshavchandra, what happened?\" And he said \" Something has happened. I could see that that man is blissful. I tried in every way to somehow make him waver, but nothing can make him waver. He knows something which I have not known and for the first time I have become interested in knowing it. I thought it is only a question of argument -- it is not.\n\"I have seen this man and his eyes and his presence and I certainly feel that he has something which I have not got. But this is a feel.\"\nSo remember, bliss is a fragrance, a feel. But one can learn the ways to find it. Sannyas is a beautiful beginning for this journey. Now remember meditation, because I teach only one thing. Once you are a sannyasin either I teach you meditation or love -- one of the two -- because both lead to the same phenomenon. To a few people I teach love because for them it is more natural and to a few people I teach meditation; for them that is more natural. But both lead to the same goal.

Chuang Tzu Auditorium</h3><p>Archive code: 8009295 ShortTitle: ICEBRG29 Audio:</p><p>No Video:</p><p>No</p><p>[NOTE: This is an unedited tape transcript of an unpublished darshan
diary, which has been scanned and cleaned up. It is for reference
purposes only.]</p><p>(Osho began tonight on a note similar to the one on which he ended
last night -- learning to listen to the inner whispering.)</p><p>Man unnecessarily seeks for knowledge on the outside because the
source of all wisdom is at the very core of your being. All that is
needed is a deep silence to hear it, because the heart cannot shout, it
only whispers. It cannot shout for the simple reason that it is not
aggressive. Shouting is aggression, violence.</p><p>The mind is very aggressive, hence it is constantly shouting, making
much fuss about everything, creating great noise. And because of this
noise one cannot hear the still, small voice within. Once this noise
ceases, when we have put the mind aside, suddenly the whisper comes so
clearly that one cannot miss it.</p><p>And because there is no mind one cannot misinterpret it either. It
comes with such certainty, with such absolute.… Self-evident it is; it
needs no proof, no argument. It is absolutely categorical. Once you have
heard it you are bound to follow it. One will never go against it, one
cannot. It is one of the fundamental laws of life.</p><p>People go astray because they don't know where to look for real
advice. In the</p><p>past they used to go to the priests, now they have started going to
the psychoanalist. The psychoanalyst is the new priest. Neither the
priest nor the psychoanalyst know anything. The priest himself was in
confusion, so is the psychoanalyst. In fact psychoanalysts go to each
other to be psychoanalysed. They have their problems, they have not
solved their problems either. They have their difficulties, their own
mess. In fact they are in more of a mess than 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>anybody else, than any profession. No other profession commits so
many suicides and no other profession goes insane as much as the
psychoanalysts -- and they are trying to help people! They themselves
are not healed.</p><p>The old proverb is absolutely pertinent about them, Physician first
heal thyself. But their profession is very profitable, it always has
been. The priest or the witchdoctor or the psychoanalyst -- they belong
to the same chain, they exploit one thing in different names, that is,
that people have forgotten to listen to their own hearts.</p><p>My effort here is to help you to find your own voice so that you
don't need any other advice. I don't give you any advice, I don't try to
solve your particular problems. My effort is totally radical; I simply
help you to put the noise inside off so that you can hear your own
voice. And then you cannot go wrong. Then you live in your own light.
That is the way of a sannyasin.</p><p>The sannyasin is not a follower, the sannyasin is not an imitator.
The sannyasin is one who has found his own soul, and now he lives
accordingly.</p><p>(He only wants drunkards and gamblers for company, Osho said, That's
what you have to be if you want to love.)</p><p>Love is when the rock of the ego is removed. Then your life's juices
start flowing. That's what love is all about your life juices. And they
come with such a flood that you start overflowing with them. You have to
share. And when you share your love energy with anybody, it is not that
you are obliging the other person, in fact, just the contrary is the
case: you feel obliged to the other because</p><p>he accepted your love. You don't ask for anything in return because
love in itself is such a joy, who cares for any reward?</p><p>Rewards are meant for purposes where the process itself is that of
misery -- then a reward is needed. So the reward is like a carrot
hanging in front of you and to get the carrot you can pass through all
kinds of miseries. The Nobel Prize, the gold medals in universities, the
presidencies, the prize minister-ships of the world -- these are just
prizes. They are very childish because to hanker for a prize is
childish, to ask for a reward is childish.</p><p>The really mature person lives in such a way that each moment in
itself is a reward. It is not that the reward will be coming later on.
The mature person has such an insight into things that the journey and
the goal are no more separate, so each step of the journey is a goal in
itself -- tremendously blissful, beautiful.</p><p>who cares about the goal? Every moment is such a benediction that one
enjoys it as an end unto itself; it is not a means to anything.</p><p>When a man has come to this state, when everything is an end unto
itself, only then has he lived his life truly, he has become really
grown-up. Growing old is not becoming grown-up. Growing old has nothing
to do with you, it is not to your credit. Every donkey becomes old; it
does not need any intelligence. But to be grown-up needs great
intelligence, great courage, and a heart which is ready to risk,
gamble.</p><p>One can be my sannyasin only if one is ready to gamble, if one is
ready to risk without holding anything back. When one is ready to be
totally committed, then only is some transformation possible. But it
brings infinite grace, it brings celebration to your life. Flowers start
showering on you, the whole existence rejoices in your joy.</p><p>(Osho talked again tonight about how we can live either as lovers or
logicians, and about how society has no use for the former so does all
it can to harness the heart's energy in the service of the head.) The
man of the heart has no market value. He has immense value in himself
but that value is not of the market; he cannot become a commodity. When
people are poor what till you do with poetry and music, what will you do
with painting and sculpture? When people are ill what are you going to
do with poet? It cannot feed, it cannot give shelter, it cannot help as
medicine.</p><p>Society is not interested in the values of the heart, its whole
interest is in tile head, so society forces every child to move towards
the head. Of course every child basically wants to move towards the
heart because that is a natural and spontaneous phenomenon. But we have
to divert him. We have to punish him, reward him, we have to create fear
and the idea of profit in him, we have to persuade him towards that
which is practical and utilitarian: Become a doctor, forget all about
dancing; become an engineer, forget all about poetry; become a
mathematician, forget all about music -- those things are for mad
people.</p><p>And when you force the child and condition the child... and society
has great powers to condition. The schools, the colleges, the
universities -- they exist not for you, they exist for society, they
serve society; they are agents of a particular establishment. And the
whole process is a long process -- it is twenty-five years at
1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>least by the time you become a Ph.D.; that means one third of your
life. But once you are conditioned you completely forget about the
heart. You by-pass the heart. The heart remains at the side, you go
directly to the head, your energy starts shooting directly to the head.
This is the misery.</p><p>I am not against science, not against mathematics. My observation is
that there are people whose heart is in mathematics, then it is
perfectly good. For example, Albert Einstein: his heart was in
mathematics so it was not a head question for Albert Einstein, it was
his love affair. But to force every child is ugly. It is a calamity, it
is coercion, it is violence.</p><p>Just think of a society where every child is forced to become a poet.
It would be good for a Shakespeare, good for a Shelley or a Byron, but
what about everybody else? If everybody has to be forced and trained to
be a poet they will not be poets; their heart will not be in it. They
will be just third-rate or even fourth-rate people, their whole life
will be of misery.</p><p>Just think of Albert Einstein being forced to become a poet, then you
will understand what is happening.</p><p>He will never be a first-class poet -- that much is certain. He can
be a first-class mathematician, he will be a fourth-rate poet, or even
that may be difficult. He will remain miserable for his whole life. That
is what is happening.</p><p>If your heart is in something then for you it is perfectly beautiful,
but it has to be a natural phenomenon, a spontaneous urge. Then
whatsoever it is you will rejoice, your heart will feel victorious, your
life will have a splendour and glory and you will feel that your life
has been of tremendous fulfilment.</p><p>But society exists in a kind of regimentation; everybody has to be
forced into a certain thing. So for a few people it is good but for the
majority it is destructive. To ninety-nine per-cent of people society is
destructive, <em>all</em> societies are the same in that way. And we
have not yet been able to create a society where everybody is given the
opportunity to be himself or herself -- respected, valued and not forced
to be somebody else.</p><p>A sannyasin has to just be his or her own self, whatsoever the
consequences, then even to live a poor life is very rich because your
heart is in it. If your heart is not in it you may become the richest
person in the world but you will be very poor because you will not
rejoice in it. Just think of Albert Einstein becoming a Rockefeller; his
heart will not be in it. Or Bernard Shaw becoming a Ford; his heart will
not be in it. Or Picasso becoming Adolf Hitler; his heart will not be in
it, he will be utterly miserable. A thousand and one times he will thing
to commit suicide, and if he does not commit suicide he will go mad.</p><p>Everybody has brought a certain duality with his birth and that
quality has to grow. Meditation helps you to find your natural urge,
your intuitive feel. Meditation simply means a state of no-thought, so
there is no disturbance, so your inner world is completely empty and you
can see and search for where your heart is.</p><p>The moment you have felt the heartbeat, the moment you have found
your inner pulse, then you are on the right track. Then whatsoever you
do will bring joy to you and ultimately god is yours. But it is only
through the heart, never otherwise.</p><p>(Osho said, If one enquires into love ultimately one finds god.) One
should go on deeper and deeper into the phenomenon of love and at the
ultimate core god will be found. But that is not to be made much of a
concern, because once god</p><p>becomes your concern you start going astray because you start
forgetting about love; you start thinking about god, believing in god,
worshipping god. And that is all false because you don't know god at
all.</p><p>The same is not true about love. You know something, everybody knows
something about love. Love is a natural phenomenon. Of course it needs
great refinement, it is very crude; it is like a raw diamond. But the
diamond <em>is</em> there, you just have to become a little bit of a
jeweller. You have to learn how to polish it, how to cut it, how to make
it shine -- and that is not very difficult.</p><p>Once you have discovered the inner beauty of the diamond and you have
cut away all that was unessential, you have found god. Love is like a
raw diamond and god is a fully polished, cut, shining diamond. But your
concern should be with love because the journey begins in love and ends
in god, and you cannot begin at the end. That's where all the religions
have gone wrong: they begin at the end -- how can you begin at the end?
You have to begin from the very beginning.</p><p>So all religions have become theologies. Theology means logic about
god. That is sheer stupidity, there is no logic about god. God is the
most illogical phenomenon. It is as illogical as love. Is there any
logic in love? You fall in love with somebody -- what logic is there? If
somebody insists "Why?", you can only shrug your shoulders, that's all.
You can only say it has happened; it is a happening, not a doing.</p><p>It is something bigger than you, hence it is incomprehensible. And it
is not of the mind, it is of the heart, 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>so the mind knows nothing about it. The mind condemns it, the mind
calls it falling in love. Mind the word</p><p>"falling", it is a condemnatory word. The mind says you have fallen,
you are no more in your senses, you have gone a little bit cuckoo. It is
a condemnation. And all the languages of the world have such words,
about this they all agree.</p><p>I don't agree. I say rising in love, not falling in love, because the
heart is a higher centre than the mind.</p><p>Of course physiologically the mind seems to be at the top and the
heart seems to be in the middle, a little below. It is only
physiologically so. But the heart is at the innermost core because the
most precious thing is always kept at the core, at the inner centre, and
the head is on the periphery. Just think that way then the total
evaluation changes; then the heart becomes the centre and the mind is
just something on the periphery, on the circumference. And when you have
great treasure you don't keep it outside, on the circumference of your
house; you keep it hidden deep in the innermost chamber of your
house.</p><p>The heart is your inner chamber where all that is beautiful and great
is hidden. Jesus calls it the kingdom of god. It is within you. It has
to be discovered -- not by logic.</p><p>Logic is good for discovering <em>things</em>. It is good for
scientific enquiry, it is absolutely impotent in subjective enquiry. For
subjective enquiry you need a totally different method -- that is love.
It is only through love that you will become aware of beauty, not
through logic. It is only through love that you will become aware of
bliss, not through logic. It is only through love that you will become
aware of god, not through logic. All that is significant is discovered
through love and all that is insignificant, mundane, is discovered by
logic.</p><p>Logic is good as far as it goes but it does not go far enough, it has
a limitation. Love has no limitations.</p><p>It is as vast as the sky, or even vaster.</p><p>I teach only one thing and that is love. Love unconditionally, love
for the sheer joy of loving, for no other motive. Love people, love
animals, love birds, love trees, rocks, stars. Don't miss any
opportunity to love. Whatsoever is available shower your love on it,
because the more you shower your love, the more love grows in you. The
more you share, the more you have, the more you give, the more you have
-- that's why I say it is a very illogical phenomenon.</p><p>Logic will not agree with it. How can logic agree with the statement
that the more you give, the more you have? It will say)of course you
will have less. If you give)that much has to be deduced, you will have
less. If you have ten rupees and you give away five you have only five
left.</p><p>Love is illogical. It says if you have ten rupees, give ten and you
have twenty. And all the great masters are absolutely in agreement with
it. It is meta- economics. It is something like a higher mathematics,
not comprehensible by lower mathematics of the mind.</p><p>To enquire into love is the only purpose of life. Life is an
opportunity to enquire into love. People go on accumulating money,
power, prestige -- these are the fools. Death will knock at their door
any moment and all their money and all their power and prestige will
collapse. They came empty-handed and they will go empty-handed. Only a
lover goes so full. He comes empty-handed but goes very full,
overflowingly full.</p><p>His death is a celebration; his life is a celebration -- his death is
the crescendo of his life.</p><p>At the moment of death when a man like Buddha or Jesus or Socrates
dies, his death is the ultimate in sharing because this is his last
moment on earth, his goodbye to existence. He gives totally and in that
total giving he receives god as a guest.</p><p>Buddha has used two words. When a person starts moving into the world
of love, becomes loving, he calls it nirvana. The word "nirvana" means
cessation of the ego -- and of course, when the ego ceases one becomes
loving. And when such a person dies Buddha calls it mahaparinirvana, the
great nirvana, because then he gives totally. We gives his body, his
mind, his heart, his life -- he gives everything back to existence. He
simply disappears into nothingness. His giving is absolute, nothing is
retained. He simply evaporates, he is no more. He has not kept anything,
not even himself; hence Buddha calls it the great cessation.</p><p>These are the two Moments which are the most valuable: the first is
nirvana when you become loving and you start sharing and the ego
disappears, and the second is the great nirvana -- that is when death
comes; you give totally, nothing is left behind, not even a trace. And
that is the moment when one becomes part of god or part of the whole.
And to be part of the whole is the only way to be holy.</p><p>To be whole is to be holy. Except for love there is no way to attain
to this infinity, to this eternity.</p><p>(Bliss can't be boxes Osho told Anand Nirupama.)</p><p>Bliss has no form. It is not an object, it is an experience; hence
science cannot verify it, science cannot 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>collect information about it.</p><p>Every scientist knows that there is something like bliss, something
like love, something like beauty, but as long as he is a scientist he
will deny them; he will say these are all fallacies, illusions,
hallucinations. For him matter is the only reality, the object is the
only reality; he denies subjectivity.</p><p>It is a very strange situation: the scientist denies himself, accepts
the objects and never becomes aware that without a subject how can there
be an object? Without a scientist how can there be science? But he
cannot put himself into a test tube so he cannot verify it, he cannot
examine it, he cannot dissect it.</p><p>The most unverifiable phenomenon is bliss. It is absolutely formless.
You cannot catch hold of it. It i5</p><p>like fragrance. A flower you can catch hold of, so science studies
the flower. But religion studies the fragrance, and the fragrance is the
very purpose of the flower, the fragrance is its essential core, its
truth, its celebration, its gift to existence. The flower exists for the
fragrance, not vice versa.</p><p>Bliss is a fragrance but it can happen only if <em>you</em> become a
flower, if <em>you</em> open up like a bud opening.</p><p>The bud contains fragrance but it remains hidden inside; unless the
petals open the fragrance cannot be released.</p><p>Meditation is just an effort to trigger the process of opening in
you, so you are no more closed, so you start coming out, you start
opening your doors and windows, you become available to the sun, to the
moon, to the stars, to the wind, to the rain. You start becoming open to
people, to all that surrounds you. When you are totally open life is
bliss... But it is an experience and very formless. You</p><p>cannot prove it, you cannot convince anybody of it, but you can
experience it. And who bothers whether anybody is convinced or not?</p><p>If you have tasted of it there is no need to bother.</p><p>Once a very great logician came to see Ramakrishna and he argued very
much against god, against truth, against bliss, and all that is inner.
Ramakrishna laughed and enjoyed it. The logician started feeling a
little bit embarrassed, obviously, because he thought that Ramakrishna
would become sad because he could not argue and he could not answer him
-- but he was rejoicing! He ashed "What is the matter with you? Are you
mad or something? -- because I am arguing against all your beliefs and
you go on laughing!"</p><p>Ramakrishna said "You can argue but how can I deny my experience? You
are simply showing that you have not experiences, that's all. And I am
enjoying it, your arguments are beautiful, but they cannot convince me
because I <em>know</em> and you don't know. Your arguments are clever
and I am enjoying them, they are very intellectual and I appreciate
them. But I cannot answer because what I have experienced is unarguable.
And who cares about convincing you? In the first place it is not
possible; even if it was possible, who bothers?"</p><p>The man was immensely impressed. This was the first time he had found
a man who could not be dislodged from his cent mind, from his grounding;
no argument affected him. Ramakrishna said "You make very convincing
arguments and they can convince anybody who has not known. But what can
I do? I am helpless: I have known it! You are like a blindman who is
arguing against light. I can understand your arguments, why you are
arguing -- because you don't have any eyes. And I am like a man who has
eyes and who has seen the light and I know. I cannot argue about it,
because you don't have any eyes.</p><p>"Only eyes can give you an experience of light, so if you want to
learn," Ramakrishna said, "what bliss is, you will have to be with me
and drop these arguments. Just once taste something of it then you can
argue."</p><p>And this man, Keshavchandra Sen was his name -- one of the greatest
logicians of the past century --</p><p>became a disciple of Ramakrishna. The whole of Calcutta was shocked,
they could not believe it, because Ramakrishna was absolutely
uneducated, a villager, a very simple person, almost a simpleton. And
Keshavchandra Sen's becoming a</p><p>disciple was very shocking news to the intelligentsia. They asked
again and again "Keshavchandra, what happened?" And he said "
<em>Something</em> has happened. I could see that that man is blissful.
I tried in every way to somehow make him waver, but nothing can make him
waver. He knows something which I have not known and for the first time
I have become interested in knowing it. I thought it is only a question
of argument -- it is not.</p><p>"I have seen this man and his eyes and his presence and I certainly
feel that he has something which I have not got. But this is a
feel."</p><p>So remember, bliss is a fragrance, a feel. But one can learn the ways
to find it. Sannyas is a beautiful beginning for this journey. Now
remember meditation, because I teach only one thing. Once you are a
sannyasin either I teach you meditation or love -- one of the two --
because both lead to the same phenomenon. To a few people I teach love
because for them it is more natural and to a few people I teach
meditation; for them that is more natural. But both lead to the same
goal. Meditation helps you to come out 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-4>Osho's books on

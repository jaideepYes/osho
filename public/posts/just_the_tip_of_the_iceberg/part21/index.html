It is for reference purposes only.]\n(The sense of 'me' is misery, Osho told Claude, a doctor from Switzerland.) The ego is misery, the root cause of all nightmares. One cannot drop misery without dropping the ego.\nYou can drop one misery but another will replace it. You can go on cutting the leaves of a tree -- other leaves will go on coming. One has to cut the very root; and the root is hidden, it is underground. You see the branches and the whole tree above the ground.\nAnd the same is true about the ego. What you see in the conscious mind are only branches and leaves and foliage. The ego is hidden in the unconscious, it is underground. One has to dig up those roots.\nThat's what sannyas is all about: finding the root cause. And the miracle is, the moment you have found the root cause you are already beyond it. Then it starts disappearing of its own accord because you no more support it, you no more cooperate with it, and without you it cannot exist even for a single moment.\nWhen the ego disappears one is humble, and in humbleness grows the flower of bliss.\n(Then to Patsy from Australia, Osho said:)\nMeditation brings real aristocracy. It creates \"aristos\" -- but real, authentic aristos. By birth nobody is an aristocrat; by birth everybody is born as a beggar, full of desires, demands, expectations. And those expectations are impossible to fulfil, hence frustration sets in. Those demands are basically impossible hence life becomes a constant misery a continuous misery, a chain of miseries, of tragedies.\nThose desires that every child brings into the world are intrinsically unfulfillable. The more you have, the more the desire jumps ahead of you for still more. Desire simply means desire for more -- how can you fulfil it? If you have so much money the desire says, \"Have ten times more.\" When you have ten times more the desire has jumped ahead, again it wants ten times more, and so on, and so forth. The distance between you and your desired goal remains constantly the same. Whether you are poor or rich, it makes no difference; the beggars are beggars and the Alexanders are also beggars.\nBut a real aristocracy is created by meditation because meditation gives you the whole kingdom of the inner world. Jesus calls it the kingdom of god. It opens up treasures which are inexhaustible. It brings tremendous contentment because all those desires which were creating discontent disappear. When you are silent those desires wither away and what is left is uncontaminated contentment, absolutely virgin contentment.\nMeditation is like poison for expectations, demands, desires. It kills all those stupidities. It cleanses you totally from all begging. Suddenly one is an emperor. One may not have anything as far as the outside world is concerned but one has something of the inner which nobody can steal, which nobody can take away, which even death cannot destroy.\nWhen you have something that is indestructible then you are really an aristocrat.\nThen you have gone beyond ordinary sleeping humanity. Then you are a new man, a totally new man, so new that there is no continuity with the old at all. It is discontinuous with the old, it is a rebirth.\n(There are two kinds of loyalty, Osho told Prem Martin -- that of the soldier and that of the sannyasin.\nBut the latter is more of a disvalue than anything, because it destroys the soul of the person.) The soldier is born when the soul is destroyed. The soldier becomes just a mechanical yea-sayer because he has been forced, manipulated, conditioned. He has forgotten his own freedom. He is reduced to a non-human entity; he has fallen below the human.\nBut throughout the whole history of man soldiers have been needed because history is political. All the 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nsocieties have been at each other's throats, all the countries have been energies of each other, and everybody is trying to conquer the world. This stupidity -- of conquering the world -- has been the root cause... because of it humanity has not become mature; it has remained retarded. The soldier is a retarded person. The whole training in the army is to retard, to prevent, your spiritual growth so that you become incapable of saying no.\nThat is a wrong kind of loyalty -- I am against it.\nAnd just at the opposite polarity is the world of sannyas. The sannyasin is exactly the polar opposite of the soldier. Sannyas means a loyalty born out of love, not out of fear, out of growth, not out of retardation, out of your freedom, not out of your slavery.\nI give you total freedom because my trust is that a totally free person is capable of a loyal heart; only a totally free person is capable of having a loyal heart. Then that loyalty comes from his own innermost core, it is not imposed. It enhances his being, it makes him graceful, beautiful. He is capable of saying no,\nbut because of love he says yes. His capacity to say no is not destroyed, it is there; if needed he can say no. But he says yes out of his own inner choice, out of his own decision.\nSannyas is your decision. Yes, it is a surrender, but the decision is yours. And when surrender comes out of your decision it has a beauty because it doesn't stink of slavery, it is fragrant with freedom.\nHence I teach love. Be more loving. And out of love slowly slowly your yes becomes bigger and bigger.\nFirst you start saying yes to the master, to your friends, to the world of the sannyasins, and slowly slowly you learn the treasures of saying yes, the blessings of saying yes. And then one day you can say yes to the whole existence, to life itself.\nThat is saying yes to god and that is the ultimate peak of surrender, of love, of trust. It brings you to the highest peak of consciousness, the Everest of consciousness.\nThe soldier falls below humanity, the sannyasin goes above humanity.\n(To Ned, a therapist from America, Osho explained the seemingly paradoxical situation that probably all of us who live here have observed -- that while the poor of India are perhaps the most impoverished people of the world, it doesn't seem to trouble them too much.)\nMeditation opens doors to inner richness. And the outer richness is only a false substitute: it keeps you in a kind of illusion that you are rich. Deep down you remain poor, because the outer richness cannot change your inner world. If you are poor in a hut, miserable in a hut, you will be poor and miserable in a palace too. The palace cannot change your misery, it has nothing to do with your misery. Your misery can only be changed by some inner transformation.\nSo there are two kinds of poor people in the world; the poor poor and the rich poor -- but both are poor.\nAnd in fact the rich poor person is far more poor, poorer than the poor poor, for the simple reason that he has contrast. He can see that the outside has become rich and in contrast his inner poverty shows more clearly. The poor man cannot\nfeel that. Both sides are poor, in and out, so there is no contrast. It is like writing with white chalk on a white wall -- there is no contrast. You carl write something, but you cannot read it. The rich man is like a blackboard on which you write with white chalk; it comes clear and loud.\nHence all rich societies have felt a tremendous urge to find inner richness. That's how religion is born --\nreligion can be born only in a rich society. The poor society can only have a pseudo kind of religion; it cannot have real religion because it cannot feel its inner poverty, there is no contrast.\nThat's why when people from the West come to India they are surprised and puzzled: people are so poor and yet they don't seem to be so miserable. They should be very miserable, but they don't seem to be as miserable as people in the West are -- and they are rich. They have all the technology and all the industry and all the scientific gadgets, but they are very very miserable. They feel that life is a meaningless project, they feel life is absurd. So when they come to the East and see poor people in a way contented they start thinking it must be because of religion. It is not so. And the Indian gurus go on saying it is because of religion -\n- that is sheer nonsense! It is not because of religion, it is because there is no contrast.\nThe poor man can still hope, the rich man cannot hope, he becomes hopeless. The poor man can hope that one day he will become rich and then everything will be all right; so he can go on dreaming, he has something to dream about. The rich man has come to the very end of the road. He has all that he had ever dreamt of, or even more than he ever dreamt of. Now, what to do? Nothing is happening. All that he wanted he has, and the emptiness still continues; in fact, it looks very clear now. One thing is certain: that this road leads nowhere; he has come to a full stop. Something else is needed. His inner search begins. When the outer search has failed completely because it has succeeded -- nothing fails like success -- he has to turn in.\nReligion happens only in a rich society. Then a new journey starts, a journey for inner treasures. We 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nhave not found it on the outside so maybe it is not on the outside -- let us look in. It is simple logic -- turn in. And those who have gone in have always found it, without exception.\nMeditation means turning in, and then you immediately see explosions of joy, richness. Suddenly your life has meaning, splendour. Suddenly a quality of dance, of rejoicing, of celebration, arises in you. All meaninglessness disappears and now you know you have something which is intrinsically yours and there is no need to hanker for anything because nothing can be found to... any improvement is not possible.\nOnce you have known the inner there is nothing more to know, there cannot be anything higher. You start overflowing with your richness; in fact you start sharing it with others.\nMeditation brings you tremendous richness, inexhaustible richness, and a deep longing to share it, to give it to everybody for no reason at all, for the sheer joy of giving it.\n(To Irene Osho spoke on a favourite theme of his -- the synthesis of love and peace -- and then turned to address Parambodhi, whose name meant ultimate enlightenment.) Man has the capacity to become a god -- and less than that won't do. Less than that will always keep you unsatisfied. And man becomes a god when the inner world is full of light. Mind is darkness. If one can put the mind aside, light explodes. It is like an atomic explosion. One becomes a fire, aflame! The whole being suddenly becomes full of light. It is our nature, but the mind is covering our light like a cloud covering the moon; because of that cloud you cannot see the moon.\nAll that we do here is to help you to put the mind aside. All the meditations are nothing but devices to put the mind aside. And once you have got even just a glimpse of your inner light, then things become very easy. Then you know that the light is inside. And then to put the mind aside is not difficult because now you know there is no risk -- it is worth putting it aside. Only in the beginning is it difficult because you only know the mind. You have been identified with it, you think you are the mind so to put it aside feels very dangerous. It feels like committing suicide, because it is you! But you are not it. It is just a deep-rooted\nmisconception, a wrong calculation. You are simply making a mathematical mistake. Two plus two are four, and you are putting five. The moment you understand it then nothing has to be done, you simply put four and things start changing.\nAnd my approach is not that of implanting a belief in you. I don't want believers. Believers have always existed and nothing has happened to them.\nI want you to experience. Believe only when you have experienced. Hence meditation, because meditation means an effort to experience on your own.\nSo while you are here try to learn the methods to put the mind aside as deeply as possible. And all the methods are available here, all the methods that have ever been tried and a few more methods which have never been tried before. So this is a great opportunity. If you put your energy totally into it something is bound to happen.\n(And while we were on the subject, Osho pointed out that it is possible for someone to think they are enlightened when actually they haven't really attained.)\nThere are many pseudo enlightened people in the world and they sincerely believe that they are enlightened. So one has to be very aware not to fall into that mistake. And the distinction is not difficult, the criterion is very simple.\nThe criterion is: if the idea of enlightenment gives you any ego then it is false. If it makes you proud then it is false. If you start claiming some superiority -- holier than thou -- then it is false. That is the simple criterion to be remembered.\nWhen it has no claim of superiority, when it is not a question of being proud, when it is not an achievement at all, when it does not fulfil your ego in any way, when on the contrary you suddenly find the ego has disappeared, you look within and you cannot find the ego at all, then it is true enlightenment. When you are not then the enlightenment is true; when you are, it is false.\n(And the only way to enlightenment is meditation, Osho told Dhyanbodhi.) One should not waste one's energies in any other direction. One can accumulate much knowledge but enlightenment will not happen. One can go on doing physical exercises, yoga and postures, enlightenment will not happen through it. It may give you a better physical health but that is not enlightenment. One can go on\nchanting mantras and enlightenment will not happen through it. It can give you a better quality of sleep but sleep is not enlightenment, Of course you will feel healthier, you will have a certain well-being, but that 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nis not enlightenment.\nEnlightenment is possible only when you go beyond thinking, when you drop the mind. Then there is nobody who can chant and nobody who can do yoga postures and nobody who can accumulate knowledge.\nAll those strategies are of the mind. When the whole mind is put aside, then nothing is left -- only a deep silence, an unfathomable silence. In that silence you come across your own light, your own innermost core starts shining forth like a great star.\nSo remember, meditation is the key and everything else is fooling around.\n(Putting the mind aside -- that's actually what sannyas is, Osho told Veet Chintan.) Man is not the body, not the mind. Man is something higher than both, bigger than both, greater than both, vaster than both. There are people, the materialists, who think that man is just the body; then there are people, the psychologists, who think man is just the mind.\nBut man is consciousness, because man can watch his body-mind, both, and the watcher cannot be the watched, the observer cannot be the observed. When you can watch the mind processes, that simply says that you are separate from them, you are not them.\nIt is really a very strange phenomenon that even great psychologists like Sigmund Freud and Adler and others have not looked at a simple fact. The simple fact of witnessing would have been enough to give them proof that man is consciousness -- neither body nor mind.\nAnd once you know you are consciousness you start existing on a higher plane,\nand of course with that higher plane your whole life changes accordingly. Your lifestyle changes, your life-gestalt changes.\nAnd I don't insist that you should change your lifestyle. You should simply move higher than the mind and you will see the miracle happening on its own -- that your lifestyle changes, that anger disappears, greed disappears, that jealousy disappears. There is no need to drop them. You simply go beyond them and they all start looking so stupid, there is no need to be bothered with theme There is no question, they simply wither away, they simply recede farther and farther away and disappear.\nSannyas is a transcendence of the mind, and that's exactly the meaning of your name. It precisely defines sannyas. Go beyond the mind and you will have infinite treasures of bliss. By going beyond the mind one goes beyond birth and death too, one becomes part of eternal life.\nReligious people have called that eternal life god; one can call it truth, one can call it enlightenment, one can call it samadhi, tao. These are different words for the same phenomenon; that one has become part of the eternal stream of consciousness. You just have to get out of the prison of the mind -- and that is the only prison.\n(And continuing on the same theme, Osho named the next initiate Veetkaya to remind her that she is neither the body nor the mind -- which in fact aren't two separate things but just two faces of the one entity.) Man is living in a psychosomatic world of body-mind. The mind is the inner body and the body is the outer mind. So the moment you go beyond the body you also go beyond the mind.\nAnd the key to going beyond it is very simple: just become an observer. Observe the body walking, sitting, going to sleep, eating. Just watch, become alert. Remain alert as much as possible. It is difficult in the beginning; but it is a knack; it comes soon. Once you make a little effort you will see that you are walking and at the same time there is an undercurrent in your watching, that you are eating, that you are drinking, that you are taking a shower. Not that you will be saying all these words inside you, there is just an awareness of what is happening.\nAnd with that awareness a separation automatically comes in. The body becomes\nsomething there on the screen and you are the onlooker, just a spectator looking at a movie, unidentified, watching the traffic or watching a river flowing by. You are not it. And suddenly a great sense of freedom comes as if you are out of a prison. And that sense of freedom is what sannyas is.\nSannyas is to bring you great freedom, and in freedom there is love, in freedom there is truth. In freedom all that you have always wanted, starts happening without any effort on your part.\nMy whole approach is to change the foundation. I am not worried about the circumference. If the center becomes transformed through awareness, the whole circumference sooner or later follows it -- it has to follow, inevitably. Hence my insistence is not on character but on consciousness, not on morality but on meditation.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nJust the Tip of the Iceberg Chapter #22\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"3461","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/just_the_tip_of_the_iceberg/part21/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/just_the_tip_of_the_iceberg/>Just The Tip Of The Iceberg</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>17 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;3461 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Just_The_Tip_Of_The_Iceberg/part21.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part20>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

mind are only branches and leaves and foliage. The ego is hidden in the
unconscious, it is underground. One has to dig up those roots.</p><p>That's what sannyas is all about: finding the root cause. And the
miracle is, the moment you have found the root cause you are already
beyond it. Then it starts disappearing of its own accord because you no
more support it, you no more cooperate with it, and without you it
cannot exist even for a single moment.</p><p>When the ego disappears one is humble, and in humbleness grows the
flower of bliss.</p><p>(Then to Patsy from Australia, Osho said:)</p><p>Meditation brings real aristocracy. It creates "aristos" -- but real,
authentic aristos. By birth nobody is an aristocrat; by birth everybody
is born as a beggar, full of desires, demands, expectations. And those
expectations are impossible to fulfil, hence frustration sets in. Those
demands are basically impossible hence life becomes a constant misery a
continuous misery, a chain of miseries, of tragedies.</p><p>Those desires that every child brings into the world are
intrinsically unfulfillable. The more you have, the more the desire
jumps ahead of you for still more. Desire simply means desire for more
-- how can you fulfil it? If you have so much money the desire says,
"Have ten times more." When you have ten times more the desire has
jumped ahead, again it wants ten times more, and so on, and so forth.
The distance between you and your desired goal remains constantly the
same. Whether you are poor or rich, it makes no difference; the beggars
are beggars and the Alexanders are also beggars.</p><p>But a real aristocracy is created by meditation because meditation
gives you the whole kingdom of the inner world. Jesus calls it the
kingdom of god. It opens up treasures which are inexhaustible. It brings
tremendous contentment because all those desires which were creating
discontent disappear. When you are silent those desires wither away and
what is left is uncontaminated contentment, absolutely virgin
contentment.</p><p>Meditation is like poison for expectations, demands, desires. It
kills all those stupidities. It cleanses you totally from all begging.
Suddenly one is an emperor. One may not have anything as far as the
outside world is concerned but one has something of the inner which
nobody can steal, which nobody can take away, which even death cannot
destroy.</p><p>When you have something that is indestructible then you are really an
aristocrat.</p><p>Then you have gone beyond ordinary sleeping humanity. Then you are a
new man, a totally new man, so new that there is no continuity with the
old at all. It is discontinuous with the old, it is a rebirth.</p><p>(There are two kinds of loyalty, Osho told Prem Martin -- that of the
soldier and that of the sannyasin.</p><p>But the latter is more of a disvalue than anything, because it
destroys the soul of the person.) The soldier is born when the soul is
destroyed. The soldier becomes just a mechanical yea-sayer because he
has been forced, manipulated, conditioned. He has forgotten his own
freedom. He is reduced to a non-human entity; he has fallen below the
human.</p><p>But throughout the whole history of man soldiers have been needed
because history is political. All the 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on

been energies of each other, and everybody is trying to conquer the
world. This stupidity -- of conquering the world -- has been the root
cause... because of it humanity has not become mature; it has remained
retarded. The soldier is a retarded person. The whole training in the
army is to retard, to prevent, your spiritual growth so that you become
incapable of saying no.</p><p>That is a wrong kind of loyalty -- I am against it.</p><p>And just at the opposite polarity is the world of sannyas. The
sannyasin is exactly the polar opposite of the soldier. Sannyas means a
loyalty born out of love, not out of fear, out of growth, not out of
retardation, out of your freedom, not out of your slavery.</p><p>I give you total freedom because my trust is that a totally free
person is capable of a loyal heart; only a totally free person is
capable of having a loyal heart. Then that loyalty comes from his own
innermost core, it is not imposed. It enhances his being, it makes him
graceful, beautiful. He is capable of saying no,</p><p>but because of love he says yes. His capacity to say no is not
destroyed, it is there; if needed he can say no. But he says yes out of
his own inner choice, out of his own decision.</p><p>Sannyas is <em>your</em> decision. Yes, it is a surrender, but the
decision is yours. And when surrender comes out of your decision it has
a beauty because it doesn't stink of slavery, it is fragrant with
freedom.</p><p>Hence I teach love. Be more loving. And out of love slowly slowly
your yes becomes bigger and bigger.</p><p>First you start saying yes to the master, to your friends, to the
world of the sannyasins, and slowly slowly you learn the treasures of
saying yes, the blessings of saying yes. And then one day you can say
yes to the whole existence, to life itself.</p><p>That is saying yes to god and that is the ultimate peak of surrender,
of love, of trust. It brings you to the highest peak of consciousness,
the Everest of consciousness.</p><p>The soldier falls below humanity, the sannyasin goes above
humanity.</p><p>(To Ned, a therapist from America, Osho explained the seemingly
paradoxical situation that probably all of us who live here have
observed -- that while the poor of India are perhaps the most
impoverished people of the world, it doesn't seem to trouble them too
much.)</p><p>Meditation opens doors to inner richness. And the outer richness is
only a false substitute: it keeps you in a kind of illusion that you are
rich. Deep down you remain poor, because the outer richness cannot
change your inner world. If you are poor in a hut, miserable in a hut,
you will be poor and miserable in a palace too. The palace cannot change
your misery, it has nothing to do with your misery. Your misery can only
be changed by some inner transformation.</p><p>So there are two kinds of poor people in the world; the poor poor and
the rich poor -- but both are poor.</p><p>And in fact the rich poor person is far more poor, poorer than the
poor poor, for the simple reason that he has contrast. He can see that
the outside has become rich and in contrast his inner poverty shows more
clearly. The poor man cannot</p><p>feel that. Both sides are poor, in and out, so there is no contrast.
It is like writing with white chalk on a white wall -- there is no
contrast. You carl write something, but you cannot read it. The rich man
is like a blackboard on which you write with white chalk; it comes clear
and loud.</p><p>Hence all rich societies have felt a tremendous urge to find inner
richness. That's how religion is born --</p><p>religion can be born only in a rich society. The poor society can
only have a pseudo kind of religion; it cannot have real religion
because it cannot feel its inner poverty, there is no contrast.</p><p>That's why when people from the West come to India they are surprised
and puzzled: people are so poor and yet they don't seem to be so
miserable. They should be very miserable, but they don't seem to be as
miserable as people in the West are -- and they are rich. They have all
the technology and all the industry and all the scientific gadgets, but
they are very very miserable. They feel that life is a meaningless
project, they feel life is absurd. So when they come to the East and see
poor people in a way contented they start thinking it must be because of
religion. It is not so. And the Indian gurus go on saying it is because
of religion -</p><p>- that is sheer nonsense! It is not because of religion, it is
because there is no contrast.</p><p>The poor man can still hope, the rich man cannot hope, he becomes
hopeless. The poor man can hope that one day he will become rich and
then everything will be all right; so he can go on dreaming, he has
something to dream about. The rich man has come to the very end of the
road. He has all that he had ever dreamt of, or even more than he ever
dreamt of. Now, what to do? Nothing is happening. All that he wanted he
has, and the emptiness still continues; in fact, it looks very clear
now. One thing is certain: that this road leads nowhere; he has come to
a full stop. Something else is needed. His inner search begins. When the
outer search has failed completely because it has succeeded -- nothing
fails like success -- he has to turn in.</p><p>Religion happens only in a rich society. Then a new journey starts, a
journey for inner treasures. We 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:justify id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on

let us look in. It is simple logic -- turn in. And those who have gone
in have always found it, without exception.</p><p>Meditation means turning in, and then you immediately see explosions
of joy, richness. Suddenly your life has meaning, splendour. Suddenly a
quality of dance, of rejoicing, of celebration, arises in you. All
meaninglessness disappears and now you know you have something which is
intrinsically yours and there is no need to hanker for anything because
nothing can be found to... any improvement is not possible.</p><p>Once you have known the inner there is nothing more to know, there
cannot be anything higher. You start overflowing with your richness; in
fact you start sharing it with others.</p><p>Meditation brings you tremendous richness, inexhaustible richness,
and a deep longing to share it, to give it to everybody for no reason at
all, for the sheer joy of giving it.</p><p>(To Irene Osho spoke on a favourite theme of his -- the synthesis of
love and peace -- and then turned to address Parambodhi, whose name
meant ultimate enlightenment.) Man has the capacity to become a god --
and less than that won't do. Less than that will always keep you
unsatisfied. And man becomes a god when the inner world is full of
light. Mind is darkness. If one can put the mind aside, light explodes.
It is like an atomic explosion. One becomes a fire, aflame! The whole
being suddenly becomes full of light. It is our nature, but the mind is
covering our light like a cloud covering the moon; because of that cloud
you cannot see the moon.</p><p>All that we do here is to help you to put the mind aside. All the
meditations are nothing but devices to put the mind aside. And once you
have got even just a glimpse of your inner light, then things become
very easy. Then you know that the light is inside. And then to put the
mind aside is not difficult because now you know there is no risk -- it
is worth putting it aside. Only in the beginning is it difficult because
you only know the mind. You have been identified with it, you think you
are the mind so to put it aside feels very dangerous. It feels like
committing suicide, because it is <em>you</em>! But you are not it. It
is just a deep-rooted</p><p>misconception, a wrong calculation. You are simply making a
mathematical mistake. Two plus two are four, and you are putting five.
The moment you understand it then nothing has to be done, you simply put
four and things start changing.</p><p>And my approach is not that of implanting a belief in you. I don't
want believers. Believers have always existed and nothing has happened
to them.</p><p>I want you to experience. Believe only when you have experienced.
Hence meditation, because meditation means an effort to experience on
your own.</p><p>So while you are here try to learn the methods to put the mind aside
as deeply as possible. And all the methods are available here, all the
methods that have ever been tried and a few more methods which have
never been tried before. So this is a great opportunity. If you put your
energy totally into it something is bound to happen.</p><p>(And while we were on the subject, Osho pointed out that it is
possible for someone to think they are enlightened when actually they
haven't really attained.)</p><p>There are many pseudo enlightened people in the world and they
sincerely believe that they are enlightened. So one has to be very aware
not to fall into that mistake. And the distinction is not difficult, the
criterion is very simple.</p><p>The criterion is: if the idea of enlightenment gives you any ego then
it is false. If it makes you proud then it is false. If you start
claiming some superiority -- holier than thou -- then it is false. That
is the simple criterion to be remembered.</p><p>When it has no claim of superiority, when it is not a question of
being proud, when it is not an achievement at all, when it does not
fulfil your ego in any way, when on the contrary you suddenly find the
ego has disappeared, you look within and you cannot find the ego at all,
then it is true enlightenment. When you are not then the enlightenment
is true; when you are, it is false.</p><p>(And the only way to enlightenment is meditation, Osho told
Dhyanbodhi.) One should not waste one's energies in any other direction.
One can accumulate much knowledge but enlightenment will not happen. One
can go on doing physical exercises, yoga and postures, enlightenment
will not happen through it. It may give you a better physical health but
that is not enlightenment. One can go on</p><p>chanting mantras and enlightenment will not happen through it. It can
give you a better quality of sleep but sleep is not enlightenment, Of
course you will feel healthier, you will have a certain well-being, but

drop the mind. Then there is nobody who can chant and nobody who can do
yoga postures and nobody who can accumulate knowledge.</p><p>All those strategies are of the mind. When the whole mind is put
aside, then nothing is left -- only a deep silence, an unfathomable
silence. In that silence you come across your own light, your own
innermost core starts shining forth like a great star.</p><p>So remember, meditation is the key and everything else is fooling
around.</p><p>(Putting the mind aside -- that's actually what sannyas is, Osho told
Veet Chintan.) Man is not the body, not the mind. Man is something
higher than both, bigger than both, greater than both, vaster than both.
There are people, the materialists, who think that man is just the body;
then there are people, the psychologists, who think man is just the
mind.</p><p>But man is consciousness, because man can watch his body-mind, both,
and the watcher cannot be the watched, the observer cannot be the
observed. When you can watch the mind processes, that simply says that
you are separate from them, you are not them.</p><p>It is really a very strange phenomenon that even great psychologists
like Sigmund Freud and Adler and others have not looked at a simple
fact. The simple fact of witnessing would have been enough to give them
proof that man is consciousness -- neither body nor mind.</p><p>And once you know you are consciousness you start existing on a
higher plane,</p><p>and of course with that higher plane your whole life changes
accordingly. Your lifestyle changes, your life-gestalt changes.</p><p>And I don't insist that you should change your lifestyle. You should
simply move higher than the mind and you will see the miracle happening
on its own -- that your lifestyle changes, that anger disappears, greed
disappears, that jealousy disappears. There is no need to drop them. You
simply go beyond them and they all start looking so stupid, there is no
need to be bothered with theme There is no question, they simply wither
away, they simply recede farther and farther away and disappear.</p><p>Sannyas is a transcendence of the mind, and that's exactly the
meaning of your name. It precisely defines sannyas. Go beyond the mind
and you will have infinite treasures of bliss. By going beyond the mind
one goes beyond birth and death too, one becomes part of eternal
life.</p><p>Religious people have called that eternal life god; one can call it
truth, one can call it enlightenment, one can call it samadhi, tao.
These are different words for the same phenomenon; that one has become
part of the eternal stream of consciousness. You just have to get out of
the prison of the mind -- and that is the only prison.</p><p>(And continuing on the same theme, Osho named the next initiate
Veetkaya to remind her that she is neither the body nor the mind --
which in fact aren't two separate things but just two faces of the one
entity.) Man is living in a psychosomatic world of body-mind. The mind
is the inner body and the body is the outer mind. So the moment you go
beyond the body you also go beyond the mind.</p><p>And the key to going beyond it is very simple: just become an
observer. Observe the body walking, sitting, going to sleep, eating.
Just watch, become alert. Remain alert as much as possible. It is
difficult in the beginning; but it is a knack; it comes soon. Once you
make a little effort you will see that you are walking and at the same
time there is an undercurrent in your watching, that you are eating,
that you are drinking, that you are taking a shower. Not that you will
be saying all these words inside you, there is just an awareness of what
is happening.</p><p>And with that awareness a separation automatically comes in. The body
becomes</p><p>something there on the screen and you are the onlooker, just a
spectator looking at a movie, unidentified, watching the traffic or
watching a river flowing by. You are not it. And suddenly a great sense
of freedom comes as if you are out of a prison. And that sense of
freedom is what sannyas is.</p><p>Sannyas is to bring you great freedom, and in freedom there is love,
in freedom there is truth. In freedom all that you have always wanted,
starts happening without any effort on your part.</p><p>My whole approach is to change the foundation. I am not worried about
the circumference. If the center becomes transformed through awareness,
the whole circumference sooner or later follows it -- it has to follow,
inevitably. Hence my insistence is not on character but on
consciousness, not on morality but on meditation.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-4>Osho's books on

These are the three realms: the 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nknown and the unknowable, and between the two is the territory of the unknown, The first step is from the know into the unknown, and the second step is from the unknown into the unknowable. These are the only two steps and the whole journey is complete. The first step is more difficult. Once you have taken the first step by dropping your misery, by dropping the clinging to the known, you will feel such freedom, such weightlessness, that you will become tempted to go into the unknowable -- naturally, inevitably. If this much beauty can happen and this much bliss can happen just by moving from the known into the unknown, you will become intrigued with the mystery of the unknowable. And then the second step is very easy; it comes of its own accord.\nSannyas means risking -- risking misery for bliss. It looks like risking in the beginning. When you have entered into it then you know that that was not the question at all, because what you have lost was not worth keeping at all and what you have gained is immense, is infinite, is immeasurable.\nI teach how to live dangerously, how to live the life of a gambler and a drunkard\n-- drunk, of course, with the divine, and gambling continuously, staking the known for the unknown and then finally the unknown for the unknowable. The moment you enter into the unknowable you have entered into god. And that is the ultimate peak of bliss; there is nothing higher than that. You have come home.\n(\"Discipline\" is something of a dirty word in the best. But the discipline he teaches is that which arises out of the consciousness of a meditator, Osho told us.)\nI teach only awareness, but out of awareness your life starts settling into a new gestalt; a new pattern arises naturally, spontaneously.\nWhen one lives unconsciously there is a different kind of life -- it is bound to be so. It comes out of unconsciousness; it is all haphazard, accidental, as if one is moving in deep sleep, walking not knowing where, not knowing from where, not knowing why, just going because the whole crowd is going somewhere. Everybody believes that when so many people are going they must be going to something significant -- -everybody thinks in the same way -- and the whole crowd is moving in sleep. This whole humanity is nothing but a crowd of somnambulists, sleepwalkers.\nThe moment you become aware, meditative, your lifestyle changes. You are no more part of the crowd, you become for the first time an individual. And then out of awareness many things disappear. All that is wrong withers away and all that is right starts attracting you. It is no more a question of choice: you need not choose between the wrong and the right, you spontaneously start moving towards the right. The wrong becomes impossible, you cannot stumble towards the wrong; you are so alert that it is no more possible.\nEven if you want to do the wrong you cannot do it, you can only do the right.\nOut of this awareness comes a beautiful discipline not imposed from the outside. Anything imposed from the outside is slavery; anything that springs from your\nvery being, that grows from your inwardness, has a beauty because it is freedom.\nTo be a disciple means to be meditative, nothing else, because the word \"disciple\" comes from the same root as discipline. It means living in the light of awareness. And the person who lives in the light of awareness is not only a beloved of the master, he becomes the beloved of the whole existence. The whole existence cooperates with him. All the blessings from all the dimensions start showering on him. He is for the first time blessed, really blessed.\n(To Mario from Italy Osho talked about the difference between revolution and rebellion.) Revolution is political, rebellion is spiritual; revolution needs a crowd, rebellion is individual. And all revolutions without any exception, have failed because the crowd is so unconscious that whatsoever it does is going to fail. The crowd consists of the lowest intelligence. And how can anything beautiful come out of the lowest intelligence? Of course it takes revenge: it kills the czars and it kills the kings; it destroys property, it changes the government. But the people who are absolutely unconscious, whatsoever they do is going to be ultimately a failure. The French Revolution failed, the Russian Revolution failed, the Chinese Revolution failed. All revolutions have failed.\nAnd rebellion has always succeeded, but it is individual. A Jesus is a rebel, a Buddha is a rebel, a Lao Tzu is a rebel.\nWe need more rebels in the world and less revolutionaries. And that's my effort through sannyas, to create rebels. Each sannyasin has to be a rebel, but that rebellion is individual. You are not fighting with any structure outside, your fight is inner. You are fighting with the structure of unconsciousness; you are destroying unconsciousness, darkness, and you are bringing light to yourself. And once the light is there you 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nlive according to that light. And more and more people living according to their light can bring a new dawn to humanity; they can bring a new man on to the earth.\nThat is the only hope. Revolutions have failed, now rebellion has to be tried on a vast scale. Millions of sannyasins, millions of meditators, are needed, and they will all be working within themselves. It is not a question of fighting with anything outside, it is something inside man that goes on defying all efforts to change, and again and again we are in the same rut.\nIn Russia they destroyed the capitalists and the division between the poor and the rich. A new division has arisen, the division between the powerful and the powerless, the people who are ruling and the people who are ruled. Another class has started happening -- the same division but a different label. And this is going to happen again and again because inner consciousness is not there, so people are bound to create something similar again; they know only that.\nI teach rebellion. Rebellion is beautiful, revolution is ugly. Revolution is violent, rebellion is non-violent. Rebellion has nothing to do with the outside world at all, yet it transforms the outside world because once the inner is changed it consequently starts triggering many things in the outside world. But that is not our purpose; it happens as a by-product. Even if a single man changes, thousands are bound to change. Whosoever comes in contact with him is bound to be transformed in some way or other. A seed will fall into his being too.\nSo in a way I am preparing for a great revolution, but not through revolution -- through rebellion, individual transformation.\n(In fact love is a bridge between man and god, Osho explained.) There is no other proof of god. We have the capacity to love -- that's the only proof, because the very capacity shows that there is something in life which is not a commodity, which is not material, which is not business. There is something in life which is not a means to something else but an end unto itself; one loves for love's sake. Now that is beyond economics, beyond politics, beyond mathematics, beyond logic.\nHence lovers have already looked to the so-called business-minded to be a little bit cuckoo, crazy, nuts!\nAnd in a way they are out of their minds, but they are out of their minds in a very beautiful way. It is not derogatory to be out of the mind. In fact, a buddha happens only when somebody is out of the mind.\nOne can fall out of the mind in two ways. One can fall below the mind, then one\ngoes to an insane asylum; one can go above the mind, then one becomes enlightened. But both are out of the mind, so they have a similarity. They are utterly different, yet one thing is similar: both are out of the mind. One has fallen below, one has transcended. Yes, there is a great difference, but there is one thing common too. A lover knows something which is out of the mind -- and it is not below the mind, it is above the mind.\nLove is the only proof for god. Love more, so that god becomes more a reality to you. You will not find god in the Bible or in the Koran or in the Gita; you will find god only in love. That is the real Bible, the real Koran, the real Gita, the real song of life, the only scripture worth studying.\n(Meditation is the art of self-awakening, Osho told a karate teacher from Germany.) Meditation needs a totality, an absolute devotion, perseverance and continuous effort to awaken yourself. And one never knows when it will bring the fruits, the flowering, hence one has to go on and on waiting with patience -- but working, working for it.\nPeople have become so lethargic that they don't want to work for anything. They would like some short-cut. They would like something like instant coffee, so that they need not do anything! But meditation needs a great industrious spirit. It needs intense inner work because it is a question of awakening and your sleep has been for millions of years; for thousands of lives you have slept. It has become a habit, it has almost become your nature\nTo awaken yourself great effort is needed. You have to shake yourself and you have to pull yourself out of your dreams. And nobody else can do it for you, on your behalf, because it is a very tricky phenomenon.\nIf somebody else tries to wake you up you will resist and you will go even deeper in your sleep, because you will not like being interfered with. Nobody wants to be interfered with.\nThe master is in a very strange situation. He wants to wake you up, but he cannot do it directly. If he tries to do it directly, just out of resistance you will fall deeper into sleep; your ego will be hurt. The master can work only in a very indirect way. He has to give you not only hints, but he has to persuade you to do it on your own. His work is of persuasion, hence it takes a long time. It can be done very easily -- the awakened person can awaken the sleepy person instantly, but\nthe problem is, the sleepy person will not 1/08/07 Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nunderstand the compassion. In fact he will feel offended, that \"Who are you? Why are you disturbing my beautiful dreams? And if I want to sleep, who are you to wake me up?\" He will not say it so clearly because he cannot say anything clearly -- he is asleep! But he will slip deeper into sleep just to avoid awakening, because whatsoever he sees he thinks is reality, and somebody is pulling him out of his reality. Maybe he is dreaming that he is an emperor with golden palaces, and you start waking him up. Of course he will be angry!\nThat's one of the things that Jesus never understood. He tried directly. And I can understand why it happened. Buddha never tried it directly. We have a long tradition of awakened people and we know how to persuade the person to do it on his own. We have to throw cold water on him, but we persuade him by saying \"Throw the water yourself. This is the bucket -- take a jump into it or pour the bucket over your head!n We persuade him in such a way, saying \"This is nectar, not water! And it is not cold, it is very lukewarm and you will enjoy it!n Once he pours it, he is finished, he will wake up -- because it is really ice-cold!\nIn the East we have a long tradition, a ten-thousand-years long tradition at least, of thousands of awakened people working. That's why nobody was crucified like Jesus. In India he learned the art of awakening people. For eighteen years he was travelling in the East, that's why for eighteen years the Bible has no account of him. The Bible remembers him when he is twelve, and then suddenly the Bible remembers him when he is thirty. Eighteen years' gap is there, and they don't have any way to explain what happened in these eighteen years. Eighteen years is a long time in the life of a man who lived only thirty-three years; eighteen years is his whole life! He was travelling in the East from Egypt to India, continuously being with many awakened masters, so he learned one thing, that people have to be awakened.\nHe was a young man and he rushed back to his country to help his people , but he was in such a hurry that he tried direct methods. Of course people crucified him -- they did not want to be awakened in such a way. He simply told them,\n\"This is ice-cold water and I am going to throw it in your eyes, and I am going to wake you up!\" This is not the right way.\nBuddha says, his last message is, \"Be a light unto yourself.\" At the very end also he is persuading \"Be a light unto yourself.\" He is saying \"You can be a light unto yourself, I am just helping you. If you want to be awakened I can give you a few hints, but the longing is yours.\"\nIt is a delicate affair, a very delicate affair. If you jump immediately jump... and that's what Jesus did.\nHe says to his disciples, \"Go and shout from the housetops.\" That is not the way to persuade people -- to shout from the housetops. They will pull you down They will kill you immediately if you shout from the housetops.\nThe master has to work very slowly and the disciple has to be industrious. It is going to take time, although the master will go on saying it can happen right now. That is part of his persuasion -- otherwise you will escape! The moment you start escaping he will say \"Just now it is going to happen! Where are you going? Wait!\" And he knows perfectly well it is not going to happen now! It will take time because you have slept so long, you have forgotten how to wake up. You have forgotten how to open your eyes, how to get rid of your dreams.\nHence patience is needed on the part of the disciple, work is needed; one has to wait and one has not to be in a hurry. The paradox is that the more you are in a hurry, the more time it takes; the less you are in a hurry, the less time it takes. If you are not in a hurry at all it can even happen right now. Watch out!\n(Osho talks about his vision of sannyas.)\nIt is not the old idea of sannyas at all, it is a totally new vision. The old sannyas was escapist, and I am against all escapism. The escapist is a coward, and god is not for cowards.\nMy sannyas is to live in the world, totally in the world, and yet fully aware, watchful -- living in the world without any clinging. No need to renounce anything. Rejoice in everything, enjoy everything, but remember to be aloof too. A part of your being should always be alert, watchful, so that you don't get involved. Act, but don't become a doer. Life has to be lived as if you are an actor on a great stage, and the whole existence is nothing but a drama. But don't\nbecome identified with the roles you are playing in the drama. That's where the problem arises, when you become identified.\nSo my sannyas can be reduced to a simple definition: non-identification with any role you are playing, whatsoever it is. One can be a doctor or a businessman, one can be an engineer or a painter -- whatsoever role you are playing, remember it is a play. Don't get serious about it. Success and failure are the same when it is a play. Whether you succeed or fail does not matter; what matters is that you remained alert all the time.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nSuccess comes, you watch it; failure comes, you watch it. Life is there, you watch it; death comes, you watch it. Your whole work is to remain a witness to all that happens around you, within and without. This is the foundation for my sannyas.\nAnd the second thing to remember is: this witnessing is possible only if you slowly move into meditation. Choose one meditation, whichever fits with you, and then go on working on it without any desire for any immediate result; forget all about result. Just go on doing it, enjoying it, and one day the result comes. But it comes only when meditation has come to a certain intensity. It is like water evaporating: when it comes to a one-hundred-degree heat it evaporates. At ninety-nine degrees it still does not evaporate, it is still water; just one degree more and it disappears.\nThe same happens with meditation: you go on working, a certain intensity comes, a certain degree of heat is created, and the ego evaporates. And when the ego is no more, god is.\n(The next initiate was a German actress.)\nMan is born with the light, every child has that flame, but slowly slowly dust gathers around it. Clouds are created by the society, by the parents, by the whole\nestablishment -- religion, politics, culture, civilisation. They are all in a great conspiracy against the small child. And the child is helpless; they go on forcing things into him. They destroy his innocence, they destroy his beauty, his grace. They cover everything in his being. They make him a beggar, and he had come as an emperor.\nSannyas moans rediscovering yourself. It is a journey of rediscovery. In short, whatsoever the society has done to you has to be undone so that you can have a new birth, a second birth, a second childhood. Once you have a second childhood you will not allow anybody to interfere with you again, because now you are not a small child, you can protect your freedom, you can fight for your innocence. You cannot be forced by any power. You can be killed -- that's perfectly okay -- but you cannot be enslaved.\nAnd my effort here is to help you to become free from all that others have imposed on you. And once you are unconditioned, once you have tasted something of freedom and joy that comes with it, you will never again allow anybody to interfere with your freedom. And not only that, you will never interfere with anybody else's freedom either.\nThat's what I call a real religious person: one who never interferes in anybody's freedom and one who never allows anybody to interfere with his freedom either.\n(Deva Dhyan.)\nMeditation is a state of absolute silence. It is not concentration. Concentration is a tense state, and in tension you cannot be silent. Silence needs relaxation, total relaxation. Meditation is not contemplation either, because contemplation means you are still thinking, maybe beautiful thoughts -- of god, love, truth --\nbut a thought is a thought; it does not matter about what. Every thought is a cloud and destroys your clarity; your vision is blocked.\nMeditation simply means no-thought, no-mind. It happens through watching your thought process, not by chanting a mantra -- because a mantra is a thought, a seed-thought; not through prayer, because prayer is again thinking, talking, words, language. One has to go beyond language, beyond words. One has to relax so totally that there is no tension -- physical or psychological.\nIn that silence, in that restfulness, one comes to one's very source, to one's very\nroots. And from there is the mutation, the transformation. From there arises a new quality to your life which is divine. God is not somebody outside, it is a quality, a fragrance. It is around the meditator. The meditator is like a flower which has opened, and godliness is a fragrance that surrounds the meditator.\nGod exists only once in a while when there is a Buddha, when there is a Christ or a Lao Tzu. Then god disappears and becomes invisible again. He becomes visible only when there is somebody like a Buddha.\nBuddha becomes the opening, and from Buddha's window god can start looking into the world. But otherwise there is no god. No atheist can be convinced that there is a god for the simple reason that he does not know anything about meditation.\nOnly a meditator knows god, but he does not know him as an object, as a person; he knows him only as his own fragrance, his own music, his own poetry, his own juice.\n(He named the last sannyasin, Devaprem -- divine love.)\nLove can be either animal or human or divine. Millions of people, the majority, know only about the first, the animal love. Animal love means using the other as a means, exploiting the other as a means. It is 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nlust, pure lust, exploitation. And of course there is bound to be conflict because you are exploiting the other and the other is trying to exploit you. Both are trying to exploit each other -- there is bound to be a conflict.\nHence the so-called lovers are continuously fighting. Psychologists have even started calling them intimate enemies -- not even friends but enemies! Of course they are intimate because they are very close to each other, living in the same room, overlapping each other's space, trying to strangle the other...(Right on cue, sounds of love-making from what seemed to be the house of the next-door neighbours' rent the air )...\nboth are doing the same! This is the so-called love.\nOnly very few know the second, human love. Human love has no conflict. When conflict ceases and harmony arises, when you are not using the other, when you respect the other and the other's freedom and the other's individuality, the other's uniqueness.… Human love never interferes with the other's space. It is not an effort to dominate, to possess. When jealousy falls away animal love disappears and human love arises.\nBut very few people know anything about human love, and unless you know about human love you are not a human being. You only look human, deep inside all kinds of animals are there, the whole jungle, wild animals. Just watch others or watch yourself with your woman or with your man and you will see all kinds of animals barking and fighting and doing all kinds of things to each other, playing all kinds of tricks, laying their trips on each other, and at the same time trying to show that they love. Love is only a facade, a mask.\nHuman love is totally different. There is no fight, no question of fight. There is respect and you are grateful that the other has agreed at least to be with you. The other has agreed for a few moments to meet and mingle, to meet and merge with you. One is constantly grateful for those moments. And there is no desire to possess, there is no desire to make it permanent either. If tomorrow it disappears, it disappears --\nsuch is the nature of things. In the morning the flower is so alive; by the evening it is gone. Nothing can be done about it. But one is still thankful that the flower blossomed; one is still grateful for whatsoever has happened through it. There is no complaint, no grudge. Human love knows no complaint, no grudge.\nAnd beyond the human is divine love. Only once in a while has a person reached that high peak. In divine love you are not in a relationship at all. It is not a question of loving this person or that, you are simply love, your very being is loving. It has become your aura, it is your very breathing, so wherever you are your love showers.\nThat is the meaning of Devaprem: divine love, not addressed to anybody in particular, but wherever you are it is always there, anybody can share it. And you will feel obliged and grateful to the person who shared your love because the\nmoment you reach to that height you become aware of a strange paradox: the more you give, the more you have. The more you share, the more goes on coming to you from some unknown source. That unknown source is god. Slowly slowly you become aware of that unknown source.

unknowable. These are the three realms: the 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished>Osho's books on

unknown, The first step is from the know into the unknown, and the
second step is from the unknown into the unknowable. These are the only
two steps and the whole journey is complete. The first step is more
difficult. Once you have taken the first step by dropping your misery,
by dropping the clinging to the known, you will feel such freedom, such
weightlessness, that you will become tempted to go into the unknowable
-- naturally, inevitably. If this much beauty can happen and this much
bliss can happen just by moving from the known into the unknown, you
will become intrigued with the mystery of the unknowable. And then the
second step is very easy; it comes of its own accord.</p><p>Sannyas means risking -- risking misery for bliss. It looks like
risking in the beginning. When you have entered into it then you know
that that was not the question at all, because what you have lost was
not worth keeping at all and what you have gained is immense, is
infinite, is immeasurable.</p><p>I teach how to live dangerously, how to live the life of a gambler
and a drunkard</p><p>-- drunk, of course, with the divine, and gambling continuously,
staking the known for the unknown and then finally the unknown for the
unknowable. The moment you enter into the unknowable you have entered
into god. And that is the ultimate peak of bliss; there is nothing
higher than that. You have come home.</p><p>("Discipline" is something of a dirty word in the best. But the
discipline he teaches is that which arises out of the consciousness of a
meditator, Osho told us.)</p><p>I teach only awareness, but out of awareness your life starts
settling into a new gestalt; a new pattern arises naturally,
spontaneously.</p><p>When one lives unconsciously there is a different kind of life -- it
is bound to be so. It comes out of unconsciousness; it is all haphazard,
accidental, as if one is moving in deep sleep, walking not knowing
where, not knowing from where, not knowing why, just going because the
whole crowd is going somewhere. Everybody believes that when so many
people are going they must be going to something significant --
-everybody thinks in the same way -- and the whole crowd is moving in
sleep. This whole humanity is nothing but a crowd of somnambulists,
sleepwalkers.</p><p>The moment you become aware, meditative, your lifestyle changes. You
are no more part of the crowd, you become for the first time an
individual. And then out of awareness many things disappear. All that is
wrong withers away and all that is right starts attracting you. It is no
more a question of choice: you need not choose between the wrong and the
right, you spontaneously start moving towards the right. The wrong
becomes impossible, you cannot stumble towards the wrong; you are so
alert that it is no more possible.</p><p>Even if you want to do the wrong you cannot do it, you can only do
the right.</p><p>Out of this awareness comes a beautiful discipline not imposed from
the outside. Anything imposed from the outside is slavery; anything that
springs from your</p><p>very being, that grows from your inwardness, has a beauty because it
is freedom.</p><p>To be a disciple means to be meditative, nothing else, because the
word "disciple" comes from the same root as discipline. It means living
in the light of awareness. And the person who lives in the light of
awareness is not only a beloved of the master, he becomes the beloved of
the whole existence. The whole existence cooperates with him. All the
blessings from all the dimensions start showering on him. He is for the
first time blessed, really blessed.</p><p>(To Mario from Italy Osho talked about the difference between
revolution and rebellion.) Revolution is political, rebellion is
spiritual; revolution needs a crowd, rebellion is individual. And all
revolutions without any exception, have failed because the crowd is so
unconscious that whatsoever it does is going to fail. The crowd consists
of the lowest intelligence. And how can anything beautiful come out of
the lowest intelligence? Of course it takes revenge: it kills the czars
and it kills the kings; it destroys property, it changes the government.
But the people who are absolutely unconscious, whatsoever they do is
going to be ultimately a failure. The French Revolution failed, the
Russian Revolution failed, the Chinese Revolution failed. All
revolutions have failed.</p><p>And rebellion has always succeeded, but it is individual. A Jesus is
a rebel, a Buddha is a rebel, a Lao Tzu is a rebel.</p><p>We need more rebels in the world and less revolutionaries. And that's
my effort through sannyas, to create rebels. Each sannyasin has to be a
rebel, but that rebellion is individual. You are not fighting with any
structure outside, your fight is inner. You are fighting with the
structure of unconsciousness; you are destroying unconsciousness,
darkness, and you are bringing light to yourself. And once the light is
there you 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>live according to that light. And more and more people living
according to their light can bring a new dawn to humanity; they can
bring a new man on to the earth.</p><p>That is the only hope. Revolutions have failed, now rebellion has to
be tried on a vast scale. Millions of sannyasins, millions of
meditators, are needed, and they will all be working within themselves.
It is not a question of fighting with anything outside, it is something
inside man that goes on defying all efforts to change, and again and
again we are in the same rut.</p><p>In Russia they destroyed the capitalists and the division between the
poor and the rich. A new division has arisen, the division between the
powerful and the powerless, the people who are ruling and the people who
are ruled. Another class has started happening -- the same division but
a different label. And this is going to happen again and again because
inner consciousness is not there, so people are bound to create
something similar again; they know only that.</p><p>I teach rebellion. Rebellion is beautiful, revolution is ugly.
Revolution is violent, rebellion is non-violent. Rebellion has nothing
to do with the outside world at all, yet it transforms the outside world
because once the inner is changed it consequently starts triggering many
things in the outside world. But that is not our purpose; it happens as
a by-product. Even if a single man changes, thousands are bound to
change. Whosoever comes in contact with him is bound to be transformed
in some way or other. A seed will fall into his being too.</p><p>So in a way I am preparing for a great revolution, but not through
revolution -- through rebellion, individual transformation.</p><p>(In fact love is a bridge between man and god, Osho explained.) There
is no other proof of god. We have the capacity to love -- that's the
only proof, because the very capacity shows that there is something in
life which is not a commodity, which is not material, which is not
business. There is something in life which is not a means to something
else but an end unto itself; one loves for love's sake. Now that is
beyond economics, beyond politics, beyond mathematics, beyond logic.</p><p>Hence lovers have already looked to the so-called business-minded to
be a little bit cuckoo, crazy, nuts!</p><p>And in a way they are out of their minds, but they are out of their
minds in a very beautiful way. It is not derogatory to be out of the
mind. In fact, a buddha happens only when somebody is out of the
mind.</p><p>One can fall out of the mind in two ways. One can fall below the
mind, then one</p><p>goes to an insane asylum; one can go above the mind, then one becomes
enlightened. But both are out of the mind, so they have a similarity.
They are utterly different, yet one thing is similar: both are out of
the mind. One has fallen below, one has transcended. Yes, there is a
great difference, but there is one thing common too. A lover knows
something which is out of the mind -- and it is not below the mind, it
is above the mind.</p><p>Love is the only proof for god. Love more, so that god becomes more a
reality to you. You will not find god in the Bible or in the Koran or in
the Gita; you will find god only in love. That is the real Bible, the
real Koran, the real Gita, the real song of life, the only scripture
worth studying.</p><p>(Meditation is the art of self-awakening, Osho told a karate teacher
from Germany.) Meditation needs a totality, an absolute devotion,
perseverance and continuous effort to awaken yourself. And one never
knows when it will bring the fruits, the flowering, hence one has to go
on and on waiting with patience -- but working, working for it.</p><p>People have become so lethargic that they don't want to work for
anything. They would like some short-cut. They would like something like
instant coffee, so that they need not do anything! But meditation needs
a great industrious spirit. It needs intense inner work because it is a
question of awakening and your sleep has been for millions of years; for
thousands of lives you have slept. It has become a habit, it has almost
become your nature</p><p>To awaken yourself great effort is needed. You have to shake yourself
and you have to pull yourself out of your dreams. And nobody else can do
it for you, on your behalf, because it is a very tricky phenomenon.</p><p>If somebody else tries to wake you up you will resist and you will go
even deeper in your sleep, because you will not like being interfered
with. Nobody wants to be interfered with.</p><p>The master is in a very strange situation. He wants to wake you up,
but he cannot do it directly. If he tries to do it directly, just out of
resistance you will fall deeper into sleep; your ego will be hurt. The
master can work only in a very indirect way. He has to give you not only
hints, but he has to persuade you to do it on your own. His work is of
persuasion, hence it takes a long time. It can be done very easily --
the awakened person can awaken the sleepy person instantly, but</p><p>the problem is, the sleepy person will not 1/08/07 Copyright Osho
International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>understand the compassion. In fact he will feel offended, that "Who
are you? Why are you disturbing my beautiful dreams? And if I want to
sleep, who are you to wake me up?" He will not say it so clearly because
he cannot say anything clearly -- he is asleep! But he will slip deeper
into sleep just to avoid awakening, because whatsoever he sees he thinks
is reality, and somebody is pulling him out of his reality. Maybe he is
dreaming that he is an emperor with golden palaces, and you start waking
him up. Of course he will be angry!</p><p>That's one of the things that Jesus never understood. He tried
directly. And I can understand why it happened. Buddha never tried it
directly. We have a long tradition of awakened people and we know how to
persuade the person to do it on his own. We have to throw cold water on
him, but we persuade him by saying "Throw the water yourself. This is
the bucket -- take a jump into it or pour the bucket over your head!n We
persuade him in such a way, saying "This is nectar, not water! And it is
not cold, it is very lukewarm and you will enjoy it!n Once he pours it,
he is finished, he will wake up -- because it is really ice-cold!</p><p>In the East we have a long tradition, a ten-thousand-years long
tradition at least, of thousands of awakened people working. That's why
nobody was crucified like Jesus. In India he learned the art of
awakening people. For eighteen years he was travelling in the East,
that's why for eighteen years the Bible has no account of him. The Bible
remembers him when he is twelve, and then suddenly the Bible remembers
him when he is thirty. Eighteen years' gap is there, and they don't have
any way to explain what happened in these eighteen years. Eighteen years
is a long time in the life of a man who lived only thirty-three years;
eighteen years is his whole life! He was travelling in the East from
Egypt to India, continuously being with many awakened masters, so he
learned one thing, that people have to be awakened.</p><p>He was a young man and he rushed back to his country to help his
people , but he was in such a hurry that he tried direct methods. Of
course people crucified him -- they did not want to be awakened in such
a way. He simply told them,</p><p>"This is ice-cold water and I am going to throw it in your eyes, and
I am going to wake you up!" This is not the right way.</p><p>Buddha says, his last message is, "Be a light unto yourself." At the
very end also he is persuading "Be a light unto yourself." He is saying
"You can be a light unto yourself, I am just helping you. If you want to
be awakened I can give you a few hints, but the longing is yours."</p><p>It is a delicate affair, a very delicate affair. If you jump
immediately jump... and that's what Jesus did.</p><p>He says to his disciples, "Go and shout from the housetops." That is
not the way to persuade people -- to shout from the housetops. They will
pull you down They will kill you immediately if you shout from the
housetops.</p><p>The master has to work very slowly and the disciple has to be
industrious. It is going to take time, although the master will go on
saying it can happen right now. That is part of his persuasion --
otherwise you will escape! The moment you start escaping he will say
"Just now it is going to happen! Where are you going? Wait!" And he
knows perfectly well it is not going to happen now! It will take time
because you have slept so long, you have forgotten how to wake up. You
have forgotten how to open your eyes, how to get rid of your dreams.</p><p>Hence patience is needed on the part of the disciple, work is needed;
one has to wait and one has not to be in a hurry. The paradox is that
the more you are in a hurry, the more time it takes; the less you are in
a hurry, the less time it takes. If you are not in a hurry at all it can
even happen right now. Watch out!</p><p>(Osho talks about his vision of sannyas.)</p><p>It is not the old idea of sannyas at all, it is a totally new vision.
The old sannyas was escapist, and I am against all escapism. The
escapist is a coward, and god is not for cowards.</p><p>My sannyas is to live in the world, totally in the world, and yet
fully aware, watchful -- living in the world without any clinging. No
need to renounce anything. Rejoice in everything, enjoy everything, but
remember to be aloof too. A part of your being should always be alert,
watchful, so that you don't get involved. Act, but don't become a doer.
Life has to be lived as if you are an actor on a great stage, and the
whole existence is nothing but a drama. But don't</p><p>become identified with the roles you are playing in the drama. That's
where the problem arises, when you become identified.</p><p>So my sannyas can be reduced to a simple definition:
non-identification with any role you are playing, whatsoever it is. One
can be a doctor or a businessman, one can be an engineer or a painter --
whatsoever role you are playing, remember it is a play. Don't get
serious about it. Success and failure are the same when it is a play.
Whether you succeed or fail does not matter; what matters is that you
remained alert all the time.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>Success comes, you watch it; failure comes, you watch it. Life is
there, you watch it; death comes, you watch it. Your whole work is to
remain a witness to all that happens around you, within and without.
This is the foundation for my sannyas.</p><p>And the second thing to remember is: this witnessing is possible only
if you slowly move into meditation. Choose one meditation, whichever
fits with you, and then go on working on it without any desire for any
immediate result; forget all about result. Just go on doing it, enjoying
it, and one day the result comes. But it comes only when meditation has
come to a certain intensity. It is like water evaporating: when it comes
to a one-hundred-degree heat it evaporates. At ninety-nine degrees it
still does not evaporate, it is still water; just one degree more and it
disappears.</p><p>The same happens with meditation: you go on working, a certain
intensity comes, a certain degree of heat is created, and the ego
evaporates. And when the ego is no more, god is.</p><p>(The next initiate was a German actress.)</p><p>Man is born with the light, every child has that flame, but slowly
slowly dust gathers around it. Clouds are created by the society, by the
parents, by the whole</p><p>establishment -- religion, politics, culture, civilisation. They are
all in a great conspiracy against the small child. And the child is
helpless; they go on forcing things into him. They destroy his
innocence, they destroy his beauty, his grace. They cover everything in
his being. They make him a beggar, and he had come as an emperor.</p><p>Sannyas moans rediscovering yourself. It is a journey of rediscovery.
In short, whatsoever the society has done to you has to be undone so
that you can have a new birth, a second birth, a second childhood. Once
you have a second childhood you will not allow anybody to interfere with
you again, because now you are not a small child, you can protect your
freedom, you can fight for your innocence. You cannot be forced by any
power. You can be killed -- that's perfectly okay -- but you cannot be
enslaved.</p><p>And my effort here is to help you to become free from all that others
have imposed on you. And once you are unconditioned, once you have
tasted something of freedom and joy that comes with it, you will never
again allow anybody to interfere with your freedom. And not only that,
you will never interfere with anybody else's freedom either.</p><p>That's what I call a real religious person: one who never interferes
in anybody's freedom and one who never allows anybody to interfere with
his freedom either.</p><p>(Deva Dhyan.)</p><p>Meditation is a state of absolute silence. It is not concentration.
Concentration is a tense state, and in tension you cannot be silent.
Silence needs relaxation, total relaxation. Meditation is not
contemplation either, because contemplation means you are still
thinking, maybe beautiful thoughts -- of god, love, truth --</p><p>but a thought <em>is</em> a thought; it does not matter about what.
Every thought is a cloud and destroys your clarity; your vision is
blocked.</p><p>Meditation simply means no-thought, no-mind. It happens through
watching your thought process, not by chanting a mantra -- because a
mantra is a thought, a seed-thought; not through prayer, because prayer
is again thinking, talking, words, language. One has to go beyond
language, beyond words. One has to relax so totally that there is no
tension -- physical or psychological.</p><p>In that silence, in that restfulness, one comes to one's very source,
to one's very</p><p>roots. And from there is the mutation, the transformation. From there
arises a new quality to your life which is divine. God is not somebody
outside, it is a quality, a fragrance. It is around the meditator. The
meditator is like a flower which has opened, and godliness is a
fragrance that surrounds the meditator.</p><p>God exists only once in a while when there is a Buddha, when there is
a Christ or a Lao Tzu. Then god disappears and becomes invisible again.
He becomes visible only when there is somebody like a Buddha.</p><p>Buddha becomes the opening, and from Buddha's window god can start
looking into the world. But otherwise there is no god. No atheist can be
convinced that there is a god for the simple reason that he does not
know anything about meditation.</p><p>Only a meditator knows god, but he does not know him as an object, as
a person; he knows him only as his own fragrance, his own music, his own
poetry, his own juice.</p><p>(He named the last sannyasin, Devaprem -- divine love.)</p><p>Love can be either animal or human or divine. Millions of people, the
majority, know only about the first, the animal love. Animal love means
using the other as a means, exploiting the other as a means. It is
1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-4>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>lust, pure lust, exploitation. And of course there is bound to be
conflict because you are exploiting the other and the other is trying to
exploit you. Both are trying to exploit each other -- there is bound to
be a conflict.</p><p>Hence the so-called lovers are continuously fighting. Psychologists
have even started calling them intimate enemies -- not even friends but
enemies! Of course they are intimate because they are very close to each
other, living in the same room, overlapping each other's space, trying
to strangle the other...(Right on cue, sounds of love-making from what
seemed to be the house of the next-door neighbours' rent the air
)...</p><p>both are doing the same! This is the so-called love.</p><p>Only very few know the second, human love. Human love has no
conflict. When conflict ceases and harmony arises, when you are not
using the other, when you respect the other and the other's freedom and
the other's individuality, the other's uniqueness.… Human love never
interferes with the other's space. It is not an effort to dominate, to
possess. When jealousy falls away animal love disappears and human love
arises.</p><p>But very few people know anything about human love, and unless you
know about human love you are not a human being. You only look human,
deep inside all kinds of animals are there, the whole jungle, wild
animals. Just watch others or watch yourself with your woman or with
your man and you will see all kinds of animals barking and fighting and
doing all kinds of things to each other, playing all kinds of tricks,
laying their trips on each other, and at the same time trying to show
that they love. Love is only a facade, a mask.</p><p>Human love is totally different. There is no fight, no question of
fight. There is respect and you are grateful that the other has agreed
at least to be with you. The other has agreed for a few moments to meet
and mingle, to meet and merge with you. One is constantly grateful for
those moments. And there is no desire to possess, there is no desire to
make it permanent either. If tomorrow it disappears, it disappears
--</p><p>such is the nature of things. In the morning the flower is so alive;
by the evening it is gone. Nothing can be done about it. But one is
still thankful that the flower blossomed; one is still grateful for
whatsoever has happened through it. There is no complaint, no grudge.
Human love knows no complaint, no grudge.</p><p>And beyond the human is divine love. Only once in a while has a
person reached that high peak. In divine love you are not in a
relationship at all. It is not a question of loving this person or that,
you are simply love, your very being is loving. It has become your aura,
it is your very breathing, so wherever you are your love showers.</p><p>That is the meaning of Devaprem: divine love, not addressed to
anybody in particular, but wherever you are it is always there, anybody
can share it. And you will feel obliged and grateful to the person who
shared your love because the</p><p>moment you reach to that height you become aware of a strange
paradox: the more you give, the more you have. The more you share, the
more goes on coming to you from some unknown source. That unknown source
is god. Slowly slowly you become aware of that unknown source. The
source of love, life, light, the source of all, is god.</p><p>At that height there is no ego. You are no more an entity, you are
just a hollow bamboo on the lips of god. The song is god's, you are just
a passage. And you are grateful that god has chosen you to be a passage,

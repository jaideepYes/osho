You cannot find bliss unless you are creative; it is a by-product.\nwhenever one creates something, bliss automatically follows. Only the creators know what it is. The painter knows when he is lost in his painting. Those are the few moments of creativity when the window opens --\nthe window in your own being -- because when one is lost in creativity the ego disappears. In the moment the ego is not there, you are, and to be is to be blissful.\nThe dancer loses himself in the dance and suddenly all is bliss. It does not matter what one creates; one may be a potter, a poet, a physician, one may be a mathematician, a musician, a mystic. It does not matter what one creates, what matters is that one creates, because except through creativity one cannot know one's 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\ntrue being. And that very knowing is bliss, that very knowing is divine, that very knowing is the knowing of god. Bliss is another name for god.\nWe call god the creator; if we are also creative in our own way then we participate in god's being. That is bliss -- that participation, that meeting, that melting, that merger.\n(Sannyas is a sort of spiritual striptease. This was the message to Anand Raphela.) Man as an ego is a wound -- he is sick, he is unhealthy. It continuously hurts; there is pain and anguish, there is misery, anxiety, darkness. One feels absolutely useless. But this whole phenomenon of the ego, this wound that hurts so much, we don't allow to be healed. We don't open it to the sun, to the rain, to the wind; we keep it hidden, we are afraid to expose it. We go on covering it, we hide it from everybody, we are afraid that somebody may know our wound. In fact because we hide it, it remains unhealed; because we keep it hidden behind layers and layers of hypocrisy it remains like a cancer -- continuously growing and becoming bigger and bigger. And the bigger it is, the more you have to hide it. You hide one side and then another side starts showing you still another side, and slowly slowly the whole of your life becomes just a black hole.\nThat's what people are, just black holes. And they are responsible for this whole thing; this hell is their own creation. Otherwise God is always ready to heal, the whole is always ready to heal. But we have to expose ourselves.\nThat's what sannyas is all about; it is total exposure. One has to stand naked, utterly naked before existence, with no secrets, with no privacy, and immediately the healing happens, the miracle happens.\nWhen it happens for the first time one cannot believe that the whole wound has evaporated so quickly. It is as if it never existed in the first place, as if it were just a dream, a nightmare. In fact that's what it is -- a dream, a nightmare.\nSannyas means exposing yourself, whatsoever you are -- without feeling guilty, without feeling condemned, without feeling that you are wrong, without thinking of what others will say, without thinking of others. Sannyas means to be unselfconscious, to open up totally without any fear. And one is in for a great surprise: all misery, all anguish, is simply not found; one is healed. But this healing happens only through exposure to the whole -- and our religions, our\nmoralities, all make us hypocrites. They are all against being nude, being in the open.\nIt is not only that we are hiding our physical nudity behind clothes, that is nothing -- we are hiding our reality also behind many many clothes. We want to appear beautiful and we hide ugliness; we want to appear knowledgeable and we hide ignorance. But remember, whatsoever you hide you will remain; you will remain that which you have hidden inside. You will never be that which you are pretending to be.\nIt is better to drop all hypocrisy. I don't teach renouncing the world, I teach renouncing hypocrisy. That is the only thing to be renounced, and everything else happens on its own. Be sincere, authentic, true.\nWhatsoever you are, accept it, because without accepting it you will not expose yourself.\nThe healing is always done by God but you have to allow him; you have to show him your wound, where it hurts. You don't deceive the physician, you have to tell him the whole thing, whatsoever it is, howsoever ugly it appears. You have to show him your wounds; only then can he take the pus out, only then can he help the healing process.\nBuddha said that he was not a philosopher but a physician. Nanak too said the same, that he was just a physician. And I see the truth of it: every master is a physician because every master only functions as a window to God. He is the ultimate physician.\nTo be a disciple means you will not be at all afraid of me, you will not at all hide in any way, gross or subtle, that you will be authentic and open. And then you have nothing to do as far as healing is concerned, it happens on its own. You can rely on God, on the whole. But one has to gather courage to expose one's total nakedness.\n(God has given us so many gifts but they are hidden in the most obvious place and that's just where we don't look. Man is a curious creature, Osho commended.)\nMan is s strange animal, a little berserk. He goes to the Himalayas, climbs Everest and goes to the moon Now he is trying to reach Mars, and he will go to\nthe farthest stars but he will not look within. And there is the whole kingdom of god.\nLove is there ready to explode. Bliss is there just waiting for you to come in and it is yours. Truth is there, your immortal being is there. Nothing has to be achieved -- it is already given, it is already part of 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nyou. Even if you want to lose it you cannot lose it, it is an intrinsic part of you, you cannot cut it yourself.\nThere is no way to lose it but there is a way to forget all about it. It will remain there and you will so on searching for it in the outside world, and because you never look in the direction it is, howsoever sincere your search is, it is going to fail.\nSannyas means the beginning of an inner journey, exploring your inner universe. And those who have gone within have found everything that is worth finding. Love is one of those gifts which are waiting inside.\nAs you turn in, suddenly spring comes and flowers start coming, love blossoms, truth is revealed, bliss explodes. Suddenly you know what Christ means when he says the kingdom of god is within you.\nGod is not like a flower but like a fragrance, not like a person but like a presence. You can feel it but you cannot touch it. You can enjoy it, rejoice in it, but you cannot possess it.\nYou can possess a flower, but you cannot possess the fragrance, you cannot hold the fragrance in your hand. But you can enjoy it, you can rejoice in it, you can feel it, you can dance with it.\nAnd Doris (the second part of her name) means bountiful, abundant, overflowing. This, call it a quality called godliness, is abundant, it is infinite, it is overflowing. One can drink as much as one wants, it is inexhaustible. So there is\nno need to be miserly about bliss. Be as blissful as you can, don't put any limit on it; you cannot exhaust it.\nBe as loving as you can, give as much love as you can. You cannot exhaust it; on the contrary, the more you give, the more you will become aware of the inexhaustible source because it will be coming and coming. And the river becomes bigger and bigger the more you share. The more you sing, the more new songs arise from the depths of your own being; the more you dance, the more dance comes in.\nBut people are living so miserly, so calculatively, so afraid that if they love somebody so much love is gone, that they withhold. The other is doing the same, and both are in tremendous need to be loved and in tremendous need to love. They are two aspects of the same coin, to love and to be loved. But both are holding, both are trying to bargain, both are trying to be as calculative and cunning as possible, both are business-like. The whole idea is to give less and take more so you are in profit. The other is also thinking the same way,\nI have heard about a Jew: he was talking to a friend about the beauty of his wife. The friend said,\n\"Excuse me, but do you know that your wife has four lovers?\" He said, \"I am aware of it.\" The man said,\n\"Then I don't understand. You always go on bragging about her beauty..., She is not faithful to you, she has four other lovers, so what kind of love is this?\"\nHe said, \"You don't understand. It is better to have twenty percent interest in a good deal than to have one hundred percent interest in a rotten deal.\" Now this is the Jewish mind: twenty percent is far better than having one hundred percent in a rotten deal.\nBut everybody is a Jew. The whole world is full of Jews, Christian Jews, Mohammedan Jews, Hindu Jews. Jewishness is not confined to the Jews only, the Jew is very comprehensive -- it includes everybody, There are many religions but the real religion seems to be Judaic, Now all other religions are just branches because dig into anybody and you will find a Jew. Wherever you find a calculator the Jew is present.\nThis calculation works in the world because in the world everything is in\nscarcity. It is perfectly logical in the world to give less and get more, then only do you have some profit. It is valid economics as far as the world is concerned but it is absolutely invalid the moment you start moving towards the beyond -- this economics does not function. You need a meta-economics.\nAnd that's what I teach, the meta-economics. There is a world beyond this world where to give more is profitable. The more you give, the more profit you have. It is a totally different arithmetic, It defies all rules of the ordinary arithmetics; it is a higher arithmetic.\nThat's why Jesus says, \"Love your enemies.\" It is not that he is saying that loving your enemies is great compassion and you are being a great saint -- that is all nonsense. He is simply talking about a higher mathematics. He is saying don't miss -- even if he is an enemy, don't be bothered, give, because the more you give, the more you will get. So why miss the opportunity? It does not matter to whom you are giving; just go on overflowing and your life will become vaster and vaster. The more you give, the more you are.\nAnd when you can give totally without holding anything, you become whole. And that is the moment when one experiences godliness, liberation, nirvana.\n(Osho named the middle-aged German doctor Anand Praphulla, and then explained why.) Bliss is like a flower; the bud is there, it only needs to open its petals. And for that opening you have to 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\ndrop all the barriers between you and the sun, between you and the moon, between you and the stars, between you an the whole, otherwise the flower cannot open If you hide the flower in a room where no sun reaches it, no wind reaches it, no rain reaches it, you may think that you are protecting it but you are killing it, you are committing a murder. It is with good intentions, of course, it is for the flower's own good, because outside there is wind and there is too much rain and too much sun and you want to protect the delicate bud. So that it can become a flower you hide it in your bedroom and you close all the doors and all\nthe windows It will die.\nIt can only open when it is connected with the sun it can only open when it can dance in the wind, it can only open when it can enjoy the shower of rain, when it can have a dialogue with the stars, It belongs to the whole; it can only open up in a deep rootedness with the whole.\nMan remains a bud, his blissfulness remains a bud for the simple reason that he is too concerned about security, concerned that he does not go into any danger, afraid of danger, insecurity, risk. So he keeps himself within a certain boundary and encloses himself in a protective wall. This is how he becomes a prisoner.\nLife can be lived only as insecurity, life can be lived only as danger -- there is no other way. The other possibility is only death. These are the two alternatives. To be in a grave is very secure. Nothing will happen to you -- no accident, no disease, no death. Nothing can happen to the dead person he is completely safe. In fact insurance companies should only insure the dead. It is a risk to insure an alive person --\nanything can happen. Any moment anything is possible. And the more alive a person is, the greater are the possibilities.\nBut in the name of security, we miss the whole opportunity of opening up. We miss immortality because we are afraid of death, If we accept the danger and go into it, in fact, rejoicing it, making it into an adventure, then life is bliss. And only these adventurous souls have known what god is.\nIt teach adventure, courage, risk. I teach aliveness.\nThe older religions have been teaching a kind of death to people. They are making them more afraid than they are already. People are already afraid and then the priest makes them more afraid of hell and all the tortures of hell. The priest exists because fear can be exploited. Once you are afraid you are in his hands; you can be exploited in every possible way.\nI teach fearlessness, and freedom. Freedom from fear is the greatest quality needed to know god, needed to know bliss, needed to know truth.\nSo come into the open, into the sky. Drop all fears because all those fears are false. And enjoy the adventure of life with all its dangers, with all its\ninsecurities. It is a beautiful life; in fact it is beautiful only because of those dangers and insecurities.\nThe plastic flower is not in danger, the real flower is in danger. But the plastic flower is not a flower at all. It is far more significant to be alive for only one day\n-- from the morning to the evening and then the petals wither away, but to live intensely and passionately for just one day, in the sun, under the sky, is enough, rather than being a plastic flower and living for thousands of years. That is not life at all, It is not a question of length, it is a question of intensity.\nOne should burn one's life torch from both ends simultaneously. Let it be a single moment but let it be totally alive. That will give you the taste of god and the taste of eternity.\n(To the brewer from Japan, the Master divulges the secret ingredient of true religion -- meditation.) One needs nothing more than that. Everything else that goes on in the name of religion is just non-essential. Know, once and for all, that meditation contains the most essential part of religion. And if one can fulfill that one requirement nothing else is needed. Then everything else comes following it of its own accord.\nAnd meditation means awareness. Awareness of the three layers, the physical, psychological and spiritual.\nThese three awarenesses make you capable of jumping into your own being. If you can manage these three things then the fourth happens of its own accord: suddenly one is just a witness, just awareness and nothing else. One knows that one is not the body, not the mind, not the heart.\nThese are three concentric circles around the center. Of course the heart is closer to being, so it is better to be in the heart than to be in the mind. The mind is closer than the body; it is better to be in the mind than in the body. But the ultimate goal is to be just your being -- no action, no thought, no feeling, just pure witnessing. And then the satori happens and one becomes full of light, full of truth. Then to live is a 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nblessing. Before it, it is just a drag; after it, it is a dance.\n(Really, meditation is a journey, Osho told Bhavan, from your head to your heart to your being.) Meditation is not-knowing, it is not like knowledge, It is far closer to feeling. It is not like logic, it is far more like love. So the first shift has to happen from the head to the heart. The heart is the bridge. And if you have reached the heart then it is just a question of one step more to your being. You are standing at the door of the temple; you can enter, there is nothing to hinder you. And nobody has stayed there for even a single moment; the moment one reaches the door of the temple, one runs, rushes in. This is the place one has been seeking and searching for, for millions of lives.\nMeditation only takes you up to the door. But that is the greatest journey -- from the head to the heart, from logic to love, from knowing to feeling. Hence the poet is closer than the scientist, the dancer is closer than the politician, the lover is closer than the businessman. But it is only through meditation that the poet will become aware of that one step, otherwise one can stand at he door of the temple keeping the door behind one.\nThat's how the poet is standing: standing at the door of the temple but looking out. The mystic is also standing at the same door, but looking in. They are standing on the same spot; the thing that makes the difference is meditation. Meditation gives you a one-hundred-and-eighty-degree turn; you don't look outside, you look in. The poet looks outside, he is exactly on the same spot.\nIt is as if you are going up a staircase and somebody else is coming down. You meet on a step, you say hello to each other. You are on exactly the same step but one is going down, the other is going up.\nThe directions of the poet and the mystic are different. They are located in the same space, on the same step; the post and the mystic are exactly on the same step, standing at the same door. But he poet is looking outside and the mystic is looking inside -- and that makes the difference, the greatest difference.\nThe moment the mystic looks in, he rushes in. Then he cannot stop, nothing can stop him. The urge to rush in is irresistible. Meditation makes you capable of that ultimate step. So focus your whole effort, your whole being, on only one thing, keep one word continuously in your remembrance -- meditation -- and put\nyour total energy into it so that it can become a reality to you.\nJust the Tip of the Iceberg Chapter #8\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"3467","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/just_the_tip_of_the_iceberg/part7/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/just_the_tip_of_the_iceberg/>Just The Tip Of The Iceberg</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>17 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;3467 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Just_The_Tip_Of_The_Iceberg/part7.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part6>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

for god.</p><p>We call god the creator; if we are also creative in our own way then
we participate in god's being. That is bliss -- that participation, that
meeting, that melting, that merger.</p><p>(Sannyas is a sort of spiritual striptease. This was the message to
Anand Raphela.) Man as an ego is a wound -- he is sick, he is unhealthy.
It continuously hurts; there is pain and anguish, there is misery,
anxiety, darkness. One feels absolutely useless. But this whole
phenomenon of the ego, this wound that hurts so much, we don't allow to
be healed. We don't open it to the sun, to the rain, to the wind; we
keep it hidden, we are afraid to expose it. We go on covering it, we
hide it from everybody, we are afraid that somebody may know our wound.
In fact because we hide it, it remains unhealed; because we keep it
hidden behind layers and layers of hypocrisy it remains like a cancer --
continuously growing and becoming bigger and bigger. And the bigger it
is, the more you have to hide it. You hide one side and then another
side starts showing you still another side, and slowly slowly the whole
of your life becomes just a black hole.</p><p>That's what people are, just black holes. And they are responsible
for this whole thing; this hell is their own creation. Otherwise God is
always ready to heal, the whole is always ready to heal. But we have to
expose ourselves.</p><p>That's what sannyas is all about; it is total exposure. One has to
stand naked, utterly naked before existence, with no secrets, with no
privacy, and immediately the healing happens, the miracle happens.</p><p>When it happens for the first time one cannot believe that the whole
wound has evaporated so quickly. It is as if it never existed in the
first place, as if it were just a dream, a nightmare. In fact that's
what it is -- a dream, a nightmare.</p><p>Sannyas means exposing yourself, whatsoever you are -- without
feeling guilty, without feeling condemned, without feeling that you are
wrong, without thinking of what others will say, without thinking of
others. Sannyas means to be unselfconscious, to open up totally without
any fear. And one is in for a great surprise: all misery, all anguish,
is simply not found; one is healed. But this healing happens only
through exposure to the whole -- and our religions, our</p><p>moralities, all make us hypocrites. They are all against being nude,
being in the open.</p><p>It is not only that we are hiding our physical nudity behind clothes,
that is nothing -- we are hiding our reality also behind many many
clothes. We want to appear beautiful and we hide ugliness; we want to
appear knowledgeable and we hide ignorance. But remember, whatsoever you
hide you will remain; you will remain that which you have hidden inside.
You will never be that which you are pretending to be.</p><p>It is better to drop all hypocrisy. I don't teach renouncing the
world, I teach renouncing hypocrisy. That is the only thing to be
renounced, and everything else happens on its own. Be sincere,
authentic, true.</p><p>Whatsoever you are, accept it, because without accepting it you will
not expose yourself.</p><p>The healing is always done by God but you have to allow him; you have
to show him your wound, where it hurts. You don't deceive the physician,
you have to tell him the whole thing, whatsoever it is, howsoever ugly
it appears. You have to show him your wounds; only then can he take the
pus out, only then can he help the healing process.</p><p>Buddha said that he was not a philosopher but a physician. Nanak too
said the same, that he was just a physician. And I see the truth of it:
every master is a physician because every master only functions as a
window to God. He is the ultimate physician.</p><p>To be a disciple means you will not be at all afraid of me, you will
not at all hide in any way, gross or subtle, that you will be authentic
and open. And then you have nothing to do as far as healing is
concerned, it happens on its own. You can rely on God, on the whole. But
one has to gather courage to expose one's total nakedness.</p><p>(God has given us so many gifts but they are hidden in the most
obvious place and that's just where we don't look. Man is a curious
creature, Osho commended.)</p><p>Man is s strange animal, a little berserk. He goes to the Himalayas,
climbs Everest and goes to the moon Now he is trying to reach Mars, and
he will go to</p><p>the farthest stars but he will not look within. And <em>there</em> is
the whole kingdom of god.</p><p>Love is there ready to explode. Bliss is there just waiting for you
to come in and it is yours. Truth is there, your immortal being is
there. Nothing has to be achieved -- it is already given, it is already

intrinsic part of you, you cannot cut it yourself.</p><p>There is no way to lose it but there is a way to forget all about it.
It will remain there and you will so on searching for it in the outside
world, and because you never look in the direction it is, howsoever
sincere your search is, it is going to fail.</p><p>Sannyas means the beginning of an inner journey, exploring your inner
universe. And those who have gone within have found everything that is
worth finding. Love is one of those gifts which are waiting inside.</p><p>As you turn in, suddenly spring comes and flowers start coming, love
blossoms, truth is revealed, bliss explodes. Suddenly you know what
Christ means when he says the kingdom of god is within you.</p><p>God is not like a flower but like a fragrance, not like a person but
like a presence. You can feel it but you cannot touch it. You can enjoy
it, rejoice in it, but you cannot possess it.</p><p>You can possess a flower, but you cannot possess the fragrance, you
cannot hold the fragrance in your hand. But you can enjoy it, you can
rejoice in it, you can feel it, you can dance with it.</p><p>And Doris (the second part of her name) means bountiful, abundant,
overflowing. This, call it a quality called godliness, is abundant, it
is infinite, it is overflowing. One can drink as much as one wants, it
is inexhaustible. So there is</p><p>no need to be miserly about bliss. Be as blissful as you can, don't
put any limit on it; you cannot exhaust it.</p><p>Be as loving as you can, give as much love as you can. You cannot
exhaust it; on the contrary, the more you give, the more you will become
aware of the inexhaustible source because it will be coming and coming.
And the river becomes bigger and bigger the more you share. The more you
sing, the more new songs arise from the depths of your own being; the
more you dance, the more dance comes in.</p><p>But people are living so miserly, so calculatively, so afraid that if
they love somebody so much love is gone, that they withhold. The other
is doing the same, and both are in tremendous need to be loved and in
tremendous need to love. They are two aspects of the same coin, to love
and to be loved. But both are holding, both are trying to bargain, both
are trying to be as calculative and cunning as possible, both are
business-like. The whole idea is to give less and take more so you are
in profit. The other is also thinking the same way,</p><p>I have heard about a Jew: he was talking to a friend about the beauty
of his wife. The friend said,</p><p>"Excuse me, but do you know that your wife has four lovers?" He said,
"I am aware of it." The man said,</p><p>"Then I don't understand. You always go on bragging about her
beauty..., She is not faithful to you, she has four other lovers, so
what kind of love is this?"</p><p>He said, "You don't understand. It is better to have twenty percent
interest in a good deal than to have one hundred percent interest in a
rotten deal." Now this is the Jewish mind: twenty percent is far better
than having one hundred percent in a rotten deal.</p><p>But everybody is a Jew. The whole world is full of Jews, Christian
Jews, Mohammedan Jews, Hindu Jews. Jewishness is not confined to the
Jews only, the Jew is very comprehensive -- it includes everybody, There
are many religions but the real religion seems to be Judaic, Now all
other religions are just branches because dig into anybody and you will
find a Jew. Wherever you find a calculator the Jew is present.</p><p>This calculation works in the world because in the world everything
is in</p><p>scarcity. It is perfectly logical in the world to give less and get
more, then only do you have some profit. It is valid economics as far as
the world is concerned but it is absolutely invalid the moment you start
moving towards the beyond -- this economics does not function. You need
a meta-economics.</p><p>And that's what I teach, the meta-economics. There is a world beyond
this world where to give more is profitable. The more you give, the more
profit you have. It is a totally different arithmetic, It defies all
rules of the ordinary arithmetics; it is a higher arithmetic.</p><p>That's why Jesus says, "Love your enemies." It is not that he is
saying that loving your enemies is great compassion and you are being a
great saint -- that is all nonsense. He is simply talking about a higher
mathematics. He is saying don't miss -- even if he is an enemy, don't be
bothered, give, because the more you give, the more you will get. So why
miss the opportunity? It does not matter to whom you are giving; just go
on overflowing and your life will become vaster and vaster. The more you
give, the more you are.</p><p>And when you can give totally without holding anything, you become
whole. And that is the moment when one experiences godliness,
liberation, nirvana.</p><p>(Osho named the middle-aged German doctor Anand Praphulla, and then
explained why.) Bliss is like a flower; the bud is there, it only needs
to open its petals. And for that opening you have to 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on

moon, between you and the stars, between you an the whole, otherwise the
flower cannot open If you hide the flower in a room where no sun reaches
it, no wind reaches it, no rain reaches it, you may think that you are
protecting it but you are killing it, you are committing a murder. It is
with good intentions, of course, it is for the flower's own good,
because outside there is wind and there is too much rain and too much
sun and you want to protect the delicate bud. So that it can become a
flower you hide it in your bedroom and you close all the doors and
all</p><p>the windows It will die.</p><p>It can only open when it is connected with the sun it can only open
when it can dance in the wind, it can only open when it can enjoy the
shower of rain, when it can have a dialogue with the stars, It belongs
to the whole; it can only open up in a deep rootedness with the
whole.</p><p>Man remains a bud, his blissfulness remains a bud for the simple
reason that he is too concerned about security, concerned that he does
not go into any danger, afraid of danger, insecurity, risk. So he keeps
himself within a certain boundary and encloses himself in a protective
wall. This is how he becomes a prisoner.</p><p>Life can be lived only as insecurity, life can be lived only as
danger -- there is no other way. The other possibility is only death.
These are the two alternatives. To be in a grave is very secure. Nothing
will happen to you -- no accident, no disease, no death. Nothing can
happen to the dead person he is completely safe. In fact insurance
companies should only insure the dead. It is a risk to insure an alive
person --</p><p>anything can happen. Any moment anything is possible. And the more
alive a person is, the greater are the possibilities.</p><p>But in the name of security, we miss the whole opportunity of opening
up. We miss immortality because we are afraid of death, If we accept the
danger and go into it, in fact, rejoicing it, making it into an
adventure, then life is bliss. And only these adventurous souls have
known what god is.</p><p>It teach adventure, courage, risk. I teach aliveness.</p><p>The older religions have been teaching a kind of death to people.
They are making them more afraid than they are already. People are
already afraid and then the priest makes them more afraid of hell and
all the tortures of hell. The priest exists because fear can be
exploited. Once you are afraid you are in his hands; you can be
exploited in every possible way.</p><p>I teach fearlessness, and freedom. Freedom from fear is the greatest
quality needed to know god, needed to know bliss, needed to know
truth.</p><p>So come into the open, into the sky. Drop all fears because all those
fears are false. And enjoy the adventure of life with all its dangers,
with all its</p><p>insecurities. It is a beautiful life; in fact it is beautiful only
because of those dangers and insecurities.</p><p>The plastic flower is not in danger, the real flower is in danger.
But the plastic flower is not a flower at all. It is far more
significant to be alive for only one day</p><p>-- from the morning to the evening and then the petals wither away,
but to live intensely and passionately for just one day, in the sun,
under the sky, is enough, rather than being a plastic flower and living
for thousands of years. That is not life at all, It is not a question of
length, it is a question of intensity.</p><p>One should burn one's life torch from both ends simultaneously. Let
it be a single moment but let it be totally alive. That will give you
the taste of god and the taste of eternity.</p><p>(To the brewer from Japan, the Master divulges the secret ingredient
of true religion -- meditation.) One needs nothing more than that.
Everything else that goes on in the name of religion is just
non-essential. Know, once and for all, that meditation contains the most
essential part of religion. And if one can fulfill that one requirement
nothing else is needed. Then everything else comes following it of its
own accord.</p><p>And meditation means awareness. Awareness of the three layers, the
physical, psychological and spiritual.</p><p>These three awarenesses make you capable of jumping into your own
being. If you can manage these three things then the fourth happens of
its own accord: suddenly one is just a witness, just awareness and
nothing else. One knows that one is not the body, not the mind, not the
heart.</p><p>These are three concentric circles around the center. Of course the
heart is closer to being, so it is better to be in the heart than to be
in the mind. The mind is closer than the body; it is better to be in the
mind than in the body. But the ultimate goal is to be just your being --
no action, no thought, no feeling, just pure witnessing. And then the
satori happens and one becomes full of light, full of truth. Then to
live is a 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:justify id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on

your heart to your being.) Meditation is not-knowing, it is not like
knowledge, It is far closer to feeling. It is not like logic, it is far
more like love. So the first shift has to happen from the head to the
heart. The heart is the bridge. And if you have reached the heart then
it is just a question of one step more to your being. You are standing
at the door of the temple; you can enter, there is nothing to hinder
you. And nobody has stayed there for even a single moment; the moment
one reaches the door of the temple, one runs, rushes in. This is the
place one has been seeking and searching for, for millions of lives.</p><p>Meditation only takes you up to the door. But that is the greatest
journey -- from the head to the heart, from logic to love, from knowing
to feeling. Hence the poet is closer than the scientist, the dancer is
closer than the politician, the lover is closer than the businessman.
But it is only through meditation that the poet will become aware of
that one step, otherwise one can stand at he door of the temple keeping
the door behind one.</p><p>That's how the poet is standing: standing at the door of the temple
but looking out. The mystic is also standing at the same door, but
looking in. They are standing on the same spot; the thing that makes the
difference is meditation. Meditation gives you a
one-hundred-and-eighty-degree turn; you don't look outside, you look in.
The poet looks outside, he is exactly on the same spot.</p><p>It is as if you are going up a staircase and somebody else is coming
down. You meet on a step, you say hello to each other. You are on
exactly the same step but one is going down, the other is going up.</p><p>The directions of the poet and the mystic are different. They are
located in the same space, on the same step; the post and the mystic are
exactly on the same step, standing at the same door. But he poet is
looking outside and the mystic is looking inside -- and that makes the
difference, the greatest difference.</p><p>The moment the mystic looks in, he rushes in. Then he cannot stop,
nothing can stop him. The urge to rush in is irresistible. Meditation
makes you capable of that ultimate step. So focus your whole effort,
your whole being, on only one thing, keep one word continuously in your
remembrance -- meditation -- and put</p><p>your total energy into it so that it can become a reality to you.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=just-the-tip-of-the-iceberg>Just the Tip of the Iceberg</h3><p>Chapter #8</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part6>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

It is for reference purposes only.]\n(It was to a social worker from Holland that Osho spoke about man's relationship to existence. We are loved by existence but its ways of expressing that love are not understood by us, he began.) We are not open, that's why we go on missing. And one always feels that something is missing. This is what is missing: existence goes on pouring love over us but we remain closed.\nAnd that love that comes from the whole is our most essential nourishment, so the soul remains starved.\nThat's what is missing. The soul is starving, it misses significance, it misses meaning.\nThere is a feeling that existence is totally indifferent to us -- it is not so, This is a stupid idea that has come into the mind of man because of scientific progress, science has given many blessings to man but certain curses have also come in the wake of it.\nIt has made man's body more healthy, more nourished, but it has made man's soul very undernourished, almost starving, It has given much but it has also taken much; and what it has given is superficial, non-essential, and what it has\ntaken away is the essential. So science goes on giving us a more comfortable life but at the same time a tremendous feeling of meaninglessness.\nAny intelligent person starts feeling that to exist is pointless. And the reason is not that to exist is pointless, the reason is that we are not able... we have completely forgotten the language to relate with existence.\nSannyas is the learning of the forgotten language so that one can again feel the joy of being, so that one can feel that we are significant to existence, that we are needed by the whole, that we are not just accidental, that we are favoured sons. That is why Jesus goes on emphasing that \"I am the son of god.\" But Christians misunderstood him. They thought only he was the son of god. He is simply telling you that wherever there is the feeling of \"I am\" the sentence is not complete unless you make it \"I am the favoured son of god, I am the only begotten son of god.\" Unless that experience happens to you, just \"I am\" is not enough. The sentence has to be completed.\nHe is not only saying something about himself, he is saying something about every I. His I does not represent ego, his I simply represents the feeling of authentic being, in everybody, But Christians got mixed up. They thought he and nobody else was the begotten son of god.\nMy teaching here is to make everybody feel as if they are the only begotten son of god. Nobody is lower, nobody is higher -- everybody is immensely significant.\n(The meaning of the name Antar Rainer is what the search called meditation is for: the inner voice, Osho explained.)\nWe unnecessarily go on seeking advice from the outside when god is really to speak to us from the innermost core of our being. He is already there but we never listen to that still, small voice. In fact, we cannot listen because we are living in such a noisy head, there is so much chattering going on. That still small voice cannot penetrate unless you make your mind absolutely silent.\nIn many universities in America they have made a few experiments with total silence. Of course their experiments are concerned with outer noise. It happened to a musician that he went into a chamber which 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nwas absolutely soundproof, no noise penetrated from the outside. He entered the chamber and he was surprised, because he was told there was absolute silence -- and he was a trained musician, he was not deaf, he had an ear for sound... He was very much puzzled; he started hearing two sounds. He rushed out and told the director, \"What is the matter? I hear two sounds.\"\nThe director laughed; he said, \"Yes, those two sounds will be there. One is of your heart functioning and the other is of the blood circulating. Those we cannot stop because they go with you.\" The musician said, \"I have never heard them before!\"\nNobody ever hears them, hut if you so into an absolutely silent chamber, one hundred percent soundproof, when you will suddenly hear your heart beating loudly -- you cannot imagine that the heart beats so loudly, it is as if the sound is almost coming from the outside -- and your blood circulating. Blood circulates with very great speed, it is s constant flow. He drew a squiggly line. It is riverlike; it has its own sound.\nThe same happens when your inner mind is completely silenced be meditative awareness. Then you hear the innermost advice and you will be able to hear it in every situation That is the finding of the inner guide.\nThe function of the master is to help you to find your inner master. The outer master is only a mirror so that you can slowly move inwards and find your own master. The real Master's work is to gradually become useless to the disciple. Slowly slowly, gradually, the master starts receding. As your inner voice starts working he starts pulling his hands back. There is no need for him, he has done his work. That is his work, to make your inner voice heard by you, then you know the source of all wisdom. Then in every situation you will be able to immediately listen to the inner heart -- and it is always right, it never goes wrong.\nThe whole purpose of meditation is just to find the inner guide. Once you have found the inner guide meditation also is no more needed; then nothing is needed, You have got your eyes open, now you can live your life with total spontaneity. You need not depend on the memory system at all, now your answers will be real\nresponses. Your actions will be real responses, not reactions.\nReactions come from the mind, responses come from the innermost core -- and there is a vast differences, an immense distance between the two. A reaction is borrowed, hence you are not your own self; the response is yours, hence it fulfils, it helps you to go on growing, to go on moving higher and higher.\nFinally, following the inner advice one comes to the point where one becomes absolutely harmonious with the whole, because when you go right always you become harmonious with the whole. That's exactly the meaning of right and wrong.\nWrong means going astray from the whole, becoming discordant with the whole, and right means falling into harmony with the whole. And the whole has a direct connection with your being.\nThat's the meaning of your name. You have to discover it, then it will become a truth to you.\n(Osho talked again tonight about meditation being the means by which we discover that our nature is light. Once we know that, we know we are immortal and there is no need to keep returning to live out another life.)\nOne moves into the vastness of existence and becomes part of it. That is what is called meeting with god. Just as a river goes into the ocean, the meditator enters the vastness of existence and becomes one with it. The twoness disappears -- that is the experience of immortality. Then one is, but not separate from the whole; one is part of the whole, an intrinsic, organic part of the whole. Those who have attained this, they are the awakened ones.\nBecause of the experience of light the awakened person is called enlightened. He has come to experience the inner light -- and that is the greatest experience in life. Life is really an opportunity to experience light, to become enlightened.\n(Then he talked of man's dual nature; he is composed of both light and darkness, Osho told Melania, an Italian woman.)\nMan consists of both. The body consists of darkness and the soul consists of light, and where this darkness and light meet that is the territory of the mind. So mind has both a little bit of light and a little bit of darkness; hence mind always\nremains in tension, because it is being pulled in two opposite directions.\nThe body pulls it towards itself, the soul pulls it towards self, And both are almost equal magnetic forces so the mind remains hanging, in between. Sometimes it chooses the body, sometimes it chooses the soul.\nBut whatsoever it chooses there is always the feeling that it is wrong because the other has been left. There 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nis a feeling that something is missing.\nMind continuously lives in choice. And every choice is going to be only half and the other half will take revenge, hence mind is anxiety, anguish. The whole effort here is to help you to no beyond mind.\nThe mind cannot become part either of the body or of the soul. One has to get out of the mind to be free of the tension. Unless one transcends mind, goes beyond it, one cannot feel peace, There is no such thing as peace of mind. People talk about peace of mind -- that is nonsense. Mind means no peace, no-mind means peace. So the right expression will be \"peace of no-mind\" -- then you are centred in your real being.\nSo I am giving you a name which represents both. Up to now you have been Melania, darkness; now you have to be light. It is a quantum leap, a jump. It is possible, although difficult -- but that difficulty is beautiful, it is a challenge. It makes life more exciting, it makes growth an adventure.\nLove, bliss, awareness -- these are things that come from the beyond. No money can purchase them, no power can purchase them, they are not commodities.\nAnd these are the only things worth having, so those who live only with purchasable things are simply wasting their lives. Life takes on a new colour and new flavour and new beauty the moment you start seeking the priceless. And the most important of all the priceless values is meditation, because once you enter\ninto meditation all other values follow of their own accord.\nA meditative person is bound to be blissful, is bound to be loving, is bound to be free, so he has freedom, he has love, he has bliss. In fact all the treasures of life become available to him, Meditation functions as a master key -- so put your whole energy into meditation.\n(By prefixing her name, Maria, with Atit (transcending) she had the whole meaning of sannyas in a nutshell, Osho told the next sannyasin.)\nMaria is a very paradoxical word, hence very significant. All paradoxes are significant because they come very close to the truth. Truth contains its opposite.\nMaria has three meanings. The first meaning is bitterness -- that is where we all are. The second meaning is rebellion -- we have to rebel against bitterness, we have to drop bitterness. That is the meaning of Atit Maria: to go beyond bitterness. The very going is rebellion. And the third meaning is fragrance.\nWhen you have gone beyond bitterness, when you have passed through the mutation, that revolution, great fragrance is released.\nWe are bitter because we are not what we should be. Everybody is feeling sour because everybody is feeling this is not what life should be; if this is all then this is nothing. There must be something more to it, and unless that something more is found one cannot drop one's bitterness. Out of this bitterness comes anger, jealousy, violence, hatred -- all kinds of negativities. One is continuously complaining but the real complaint is somewhere else deep down. It is a complaint against existence, that \"What am I doing here?\nWhy am I here? -- nothing is happening. Why am I forced to be alive, because nothing is happening.\" Time goes on passing and life remains without any bliss. It creates bitterness.\nIt is not accidental that old people become very bitter. It is very difficult to live with old people, even if they are your own parents. It is very difficult for the simple reason that their whole life has gone down the drain, they are feeling bitter. They jump upon everything to throw their negativity; they start catharting and freaking out over anything. They cannot tolerate children being happy, dancing, singing, shouting out of joy\n-- they cannot tolerate it. It is a nuisance for them, because they have missed their life. And in fact when they are saying, \"Don't be a nuisance to us,\" they are simply saying, \"How dare you be so joyous!\" They are against young people, and whatsoever the young people are doing, the old always think they are wrong.\nIn fact, they are simply feeling bitter about the whole thing called life. And they go on finding excuses.… It is very rare to find an old person who is not bitter, that means he has lived really beautifully, he is really grown-up. Then old people have tremendous beauty which no young man can ever have. He has a certain ripeness, maturity, he is seasoned. He has seen so much and lived so much that he is tremendously grateful to god.\nBut it is very hard to find that type of old man, because it means that man is a Buddha, a Christ, a Krishna. Only an awakened person can be non-bitter in old age -- because death is coming, life is gone, what is there for one to be happy about? One is simply angry.\nYou have heard about angry people, angry young men, but really no young man can ever be as angry as old people. Nobody talks about angry old men, but my own experience -- I have watched young people, old 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\npeople -- is that nobody can be as angry as the old.\nBitterness is a state of ignorance. You have to go beyond it, you have to learn the awareness which becomes a bridge to take you beyond. And that very going is revolution. The moment you have really gone beyond all complaints, all no's, there arises a tremendous yes -- just yes, yes, yes -- there is great fragrance.\nThe same energy that was bitter becomes fragrance.\nThis is the whole process of sannyas. Your name contains the whole process of sannyas, from bitterness to fragrance.\n(Her new name, Prabhati, means a morning song, Osho said and then he\ndescribed the Indian custom of singing to welcome the new day.)\nPrabhat is sung in praise of the morning sun. Prabhat means the morning, the dawn, when the sun is just about to rise. The East has become red but the sun has not yet come to the horizon.\nIn India we have songs for every hour -- different melodies, different songs. For the evening we have one kind of song which has some attunement with the evening; for the night we have different songs, different melodies; for midnight again a different melody.\nTo be in attunement with existence, Indian music is divided into hours. There are different songs for each twenty-four hours, because every hour existence takes a new birth. It is different -- morning is different.\nIn the morning birds are singing -- that is prabhati. In the night it is all silent; birds are asleep, trees are asleep, everybody is asleep -- so we have melodies which will help you to go into deep sleep. The prabhati will wake you up.\nIn the ancient days there was a routine in the ashrams, and that's what I'm thinking of having for the new commune. In the morning when the sun is just about to rise, there should be singing, dancing; just as birds and trees sway in the wind and everybody is agog, waiting for the sun to come on the horizon, and then suddenly the sun comes. It is a welcoming song. The most beautiful song is prabhati because it is the beginning of the day, the beginning of a new day, a new birth.\nIn the East we have thought that going to sleep every night is a small death. It is, because in sleep you completely forget who you are. If you die in your sleep you will never know when you died or whether you were ever alive. So sleep is a small death, a mini-death. And every morning is a mini-birth, a new birth, and you have to praise the lord -- he has given you another day! We are not worthy, we have wasted yesterday, all the yesterdays. But he is generous, he has given us another chance to try again, to live, to rejoice, to be total!\nIn the East the color orange is the color of the morning, of the dawn. That's why I have chosen it for my sannyasins. It has to be the dawn of a new humanity. My sannyasin has to prove that there is a new man on earth; that is the most essential thing needed today: the beginning of the new man. The old is finished and gone, the old is tired, exhausted, spent. We are just somehow carrying the old corpse. It\nneeds to be burned, given a last farewell. We have to say goodbye to it so that we can welcome the new. The evening songs are goodbye -- saying goodbye to the sun. Maybe we will never see the sun again; so it is the last goodbye, every day we say a last goodbye. But in the morning there has to be a welcome song -- that is prabhati.\nMeditation brings you to the beginning of a new birth, an inner birth; it is the beginning of dawn inside.\nSo the outer orange simply represents something of the inside. It is only through meditation that one can get out of sleep and can enter the day, because it is only through meditation that one can become awake. So put your energies into meditation, focus all your energies on meditation.\nAnd the morning is never far away; it simply needs the heart to open a song of welcome, and it is there.\nIt is just waiting for you to sing your heart out. The moment you start dancing the sun cannot resist the temptation to come up on the horizon.\nI feel sometimes that if one day all the birds decide not to sing, the sun will not rise. For what? If all the trees decide not to open their flowers saying, \"Let the sun come first,\" the sun won't come. There has to be an inner connection; it cannot be a one-sided affair. It is not only that the sun rises and the flowers open and the birds sing -- no. Vice versa is also true: the flowers open, the birds sing and the sun rises. It has to be two-way.\nLife is always interdependent; the poets have felt it. Tennyson said, \"If I could understand a single flower, root and all, then I would understand the whole universe.\"\nAnd he is right -- but this has been only a feeling in the poets. Mystics have seen it, experienced it, that this is so.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\n(Anahato, his new name, means the inner music, Osho told the last sannyasin.) The inner music has a strange quality. The outer music needs an instrument, it needs a duality -- the musician and the instrument. The inner music does not need duality -- the musician is the music. The musician is the instrument, the musician is all. There is no division.\nThe Zen people call it the sound of one hand clapping. No, one hand cannot clap. They are simply showing that inside it happens, the sound of one hand clapping. Two hands are needed to clap. That is the outside music, two hands clapping. It is easy for two hands to clap; there is a conflict, there is a struggle, there is a clash. But the inner music, anahato, means silence, the sound of silence.\nSilence has its own music. It can be heard only by those who have dropped all noise from the head. It can be heard only by the heart, not by the head. The heady person goes on missing it. Only the person who is full of heart, full of love, can hear the music.\nThis is the music that helps you to go into the beyond. It becomes a rainbow bridge. You cannot grasp it with the mind, you cannot comprehend it with the mind. The mind has to be put aside, completely put aside, and then suddenly it is there.\nThat is the whole art of meditation, putting the mind slowly aside and getting to the inner music, becoming attuned to the inner world of oneness. You can call it the experience of god, tao, truth, dhamma, it is really nothing but the experience of the ultimate music. All names for it are good, they indicate some quality of it, but it is the hidden harmony of Heraclitus; that is the same thing.\nTo me, Heraclitus is not a philosopher but a mystic and one of the greatest mystics. The West has completely misunderstood him. He talks about the hidden harmony, it is hidden in everybody, and once you have known it inside you, you will be able to know it everywhere else.\nJust the Tip of the Iceberg Chapter #7\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"3715","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/just_the_tip_of_the_iceberg/part6/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/just_the_tip_of_the_iceberg/>Just The Tip Of The Iceberg</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>18 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;3715 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Just_The_Tip_Of_The_Iceberg/part6.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part5>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

Chuang Tzu Auditorium</h3><p>Archive code: 8009065 ShortTitle: ICEBRG06 Audio:</p><p>No Video:</p><p>No</p><p>[NOTE: This is an unedited tape transcript of an unpublished darshan
diary, which has been scanned and cleaned up. It is for reference
purposes only.]</p><p>(It was to a social worker from Holland that Osho spoke about man's
relationship to existence. We are loved by existence but its ways of
expressing that love are not understood by us, he began.) We are not
open, that's why we go on missing. And one always feels that something
is missing. This is what is missing: existence goes on pouring love over
us but we remain closed.</p><p>And that love that comes from the whole is our most essential
nourishment, so the soul remains starved.</p><p>That's what is missing. The soul is starving, it misses significance,
it misses meaning.</p><p>There is a feeling that existence is totally indifferent to us -- it
is not so, This is a stupid idea that has come into the mind of man
because of scientific progress, science has given many blessings to man
but certain curses have also come in the wake of it.</p><p>It has made man's body more healthy, more nourished, but it has made
man's soul very undernourished, almost starving, It has given much but
it has also taken much; and what it has given is superficial,
non-essential, and what it has</p><p>taken away is the essential. So science goes on giving us a more
comfortable life but at the same time a tremendous feeling of
meaninglessness.</p><p>Any intelligent person starts feeling that to exist is pointless. And
the reason is not that to exist is pointless, the reason is that we are
not able... we have completely forgotten the language to relate with
existence.</p><p>Sannyas is the learning of the forgotten language so that one can
again feel the joy of being, so that one can feel that we are
significant to existence, that we are needed by the whole, that we are
not just accidental, that we are favoured sons. That is why Jesus goes
on emphasing that "I am the son of god." But Christians misunderstood
him. They thought only he was the son of god. He is simply telling you
that wherever there is the feeling of "I am" the sentence is not
complete unless you make it "I am the favoured son of god, I am the only
begotten son of god." Unless that experience happens to you, just "I am"
is not enough. The sentence has to be completed.</p><p>He is not only saying something about himself, he is saying something
about every I. His I does not represent ego, his I simply represents the
feeling of authentic being, in everybody, But Christians got mixed up.
They thought he and nobody else was the begotten son of god.</p><p>My teaching here is to make everybody feel as if they are the only
begotten son of god. Nobody is lower, nobody is higher -- everybody is
immensely significant.</p><p>(The meaning of the name Antar Rainer is what the search called
meditation is for: the inner voice, Osho explained.)</p><p>We unnecessarily go on seeking advice from the outside when god is
really to speak to us from the innermost core of our being. He is
already there but we never listen to that still, small voice. In fact,
we cannot listen because we are living in such a noisy head, there is so
much chattering going on. That still small voice cannot penetrate unless
you make your mind absolutely silent.</p><p>In many universities in America they have made a few experiments with
total silence. Of course their experiments are concerned with outer
noise. It happened to a musician that he went into a chamber which
1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>was absolutely soundproof, no noise penetrated from the outside. He
entered the chamber and he was surprised, because he was told there was
absolute silence -- and he was a trained musician, he was not deaf, he
had an ear for sound... He was very much puzzled; he started hearing two
sounds. He rushed out and told the director, "What is the matter? I hear
two sounds."</p><p>The director laughed; he said, "Yes, those two sounds will be there.
One is of your heart functioning and the other is of the blood
circulating. Those we cannot stop because they go with you." The
musician said, "I have never heard them before!"</p><p>Nobody ever hears them, hut if you so into an absolutely silent
chamber, one hundred percent soundproof, when you will suddenly hear
your heart beating loudly -- you cannot imagine that the heart beats so
loudly, it is as if the sound is almost coming from the outside -- and
your blood circulating. Blood circulates with very great speed, it is s
constant flow. He drew a squiggly line. It is riverlike; it has its own
sound.</p><p>The same happens when your inner mind is completely silenced be
meditative awareness. Then you hear the innermost advice and you will be
able to hear it in every situation That is the finding of the inner
guide.</p><p>The function of the master is to help you to find your inner master.
The outer master is only a mirror so that you can slowly move inwards
and find your own master. The real Master's work is to gradually become
useless to the disciple. Slowly slowly, gradually, the master starts
receding. As your inner voice starts working he starts pulling his hands
back. There is no need for him, he has done his work. That is his work,
to make your inner voice heard by you, then you know the source of all
wisdom. Then in every situation you will be able to immediately listen
to the inner heart -- and it is always right, it never goes wrong.</p><p>The whole purpose of meditation is just to find the inner guide. Once
you have found the inner guide meditation also is no more needed; then
nothing is needed, You have got your eyes open, now you can live your
life with total spontaneity. You need not depend on the memory system at
all, now your answers will be real</p><p>responses. Your actions will be real responses, not reactions.</p><p>Reactions come from the mind, responses come from the innermost core
-- and there is a vast differences, an immense distance between the two.
A reaction is borrowed, hence you are not your own self; the response is
yours, hence it fulfils, it helps you to go on growing, to go on moving
higher and higher.</p><p>Finally, following the inner advice one comes to the point where one
becomes absolutely harmonious with the whole, because when you go right
always you become harmonious with the whole. That's exactly the meaning
of right and wrong.</p><p>Wrong means going astray from the whole, becoming discordant with the
whole, and right means falling into harmony with the whole. And the
whole has a direct connection with your being.</p><p>That's the meaning of your name. You have to discover it, then it
will become a truth to you.</p><p>(Osho talked again tonight about meditation being the means by which
we discover that our nature is light. Once we know that, we know we are
immortal and there is no need to keep returning to live out another
life.)</p><p>One moves into the vastness of existence and becomes part of it. That
is what is called meeting with god. Just as a river goes into the ocean,
the meditator enters the vastness of existence and becomes one with it.
The twoness disappears -- that is the experience of immortality. Then
one is, but not separate from the whole; one is part of the whole, an
intrinsic, organic part of the whole. Those who have attained this, they
are the awakened ones.</p><p>Because of the experience of light the awakened person is called
enlightened. He has come to experience the inner light -- and that is
the greatest experience in life. Life is really an opportunity to
experience light, to become enlightened.</p><p>(Then he talked of man's dual nature; he is composed of both light
and darkness, Osho told Melania, an Italian woman.)</p><p>Man consists of both. The body consists of darkness and the soul
consists of light, and where this darkness and light meet that is the
territory of the mind. So mind has both a little bit of light and a
little bit of darkness; hence mind always</p><p>remains in tension, because it is being pulled in two opposite
directions.</p><p>The body pulls it towards itself, the soul pulls it towards self, And
both are almost equal magnetic forces so the mind remains hanging, in
between. Sometimes it chooses the body, sometimes it chooses the
soul.</p><p>But whatsoever it chooses there is always the feeling that it is
wrong because the other has been left. There 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on

only half and the other half will take revenge, hence mind is anxiety,
anguish. The whole effort here is to help you to no beyond mind.</p><p>The mind cannot become part either of the body or of the soul. One
has to get out of the mind to be free of the tension. Unless one
transcends mind, goes beyond it, one cannot feel peace, There is no such
thing as peace of mind. People talk about peace of mind -- that is
nonsense. Mind means no peace, no-mind means peace. So the right
expression will be "peace of no-mind" -- then you are centred in your
real being.</p><p>So I am giving you a name which represents both. Up to now you have
been Melania, darkness; now you have to be light. It is a quantum leap,
a jump. It is possible, although difficult -- but that difficulty is
beautiful, it is a challenge. It makes life more exciting, it makes
growth an adventure.</p><p>Love, bliss, awareness -- these are things that come from the beyond.
No money can purchase them, no power can purchase them, they are not
commodities.</p><p>And these are the only things worth having, so those who live only
with purchasable things are simply wasting their lives. Life takes on a
new colour and new flavour and new beauty the moment you start seeking
the priceless. And the most important of all the priceless values is
meditation, because once you enter</p><p>into meditation all other values follow of their own accord.</p><p>A meditative person is bound to be blissful, is bound to be loving,
is bound to be free, so he has freedom, he has love, he has bliss. In
fact all the treasures of life become available to him, Meditation
functions as a master key -- so put your whole energy into
meditation.</p><p>(By prefixing her name, Maria, with Atit (transcending) she had the
whole meaning of sannyas in a nutshell, Osho told the next
sannyasin.)</p><p>Maria is a very paradoxical word, hence very significant. All
paradoxes are significant because they come very close to the truth.
Truth contains its opposite.</p><p>Maria has three meanings. The first meaning is bitterness -- that is
where we all are. The second meaning is rebellion -- we have to rebel
against bitterness, we have to drop bitterness. That is the meaning of
Atit Maria: to go beyond bitterness. The very going is rebellion. And
the third meaning is fragrance.</p><p>When you have gone beyond bitterness, when you have passed through
the mutation, that revolution, great fragrance is released.</p><p>We are bitter because we are not what we should be. Everybody is
feeling sour because everybody is feeling this is not what life should
be; if this is all then this is nothing. There must be something more to
it, and unless that something more is found one cannot drop one's
bitterness. Out of this bitterness comes anger, jealousy, violence,
hatred -- all kinds of negativities. One is continuously complaining but
the real complaint is somewhere else deep down. It is a complaint
against existence, that "What am I doing here?</p><p>Why am I here? -- nothing is happening. Why am I forced to be alive,
because nothing is happening." Time goes on passing and life remains
without any bliss. It creates bitterness.</p><p>It is not accidental that old people become very bitter. It is very
difficult to live with old people, even if they are your own parents. It
is very difficult for the simple reason that their whole life has gone
down the drain, they are feeling bitter. They jump upon everything to
throw their negativity; they start catharting and freaking out over
anything. They cannot tolerate children being happy, dancing, singing,
shouting out of joy</p><p>-- they cannot tolerate it. It is a nuisance for them, because they
have missed their life. And in fact when they are saying, "Don't be a
nuisance to us," they are simply saying, "How dare you be so joyous!"
They are against young people, and whatsoever the young people are
doing, the old always think they are wrong.</p><p>In fact, they are simply feeling bitter about the whole thing called
life. And they go on finding excuses.… It is very rare to find an old
person who is not bitter, that means he has lived really beautifully, he
is really grown-up. Then old people have tremendous beauty which no
young man can ever have. He has a certain ripeness, maturity, he is
seasoned. He has seen so much and lived so much that he is tremendously
grateful to god.</p><p>But it is very hard to find that type of old man, because it means
that man is a Buddha, a Christ, a Krishna. Only an awakened person can
be non-bitter in old age -- because death is coming, life is gone, what
is there for one to be happy about? One is simply angry.</p><p>You have heard about angry people, angry young men, but really no
young man can ever be as angry as old people. Nobody talks about angry
old men, but my own experience -- I have watched young people, old

have to learn the awareness which becomes a bridge to take you beyond.
And that very going is revolution. The moment you have really gone
beyond all complaints, all no's, there arises a tremendous yes -- just
yes, yes, yes -- there is great fragrance.</p><p>The same energy that was bitter becomes fragrance.</p><p>This is the whole process of sannyas. Your name contains the whole
process of sannyas, from bitterness to fragrance.</p><p>(Her new name, Prabhati, means a morning song, Osho said and then
he</p><p>described the Indian custom of singing to welcome the new day.)</p><p>Prabhat is sung in praise of the morning sun. Prabhat means the
morning, the dawn, when the sun is just about to rise. The East has
become red but the sun has not yet come to the horizon.</p><p>In India we have songs for every hour -- different melodies,
different songs. For the evening we have one kind of song which has some
attunement with the evening; for the night we have different songs,
different melodies; for midnight again a different melody.</p><p>To be in attunement with existence, Indian music is divided into
hours. There are different songs for each twenty-four hours, because
every hour existence takes a new birth. It is different -- morning is
different.</p><p>In the morning birds are singing -- that is prabhati. In the night it
is all silent; birds are asleep, trees are asleep, everybody is asleep
-- so we have melodies which will help you to go into deep sleep. The
prabhati will wake you up.</p><p>In the ancient days there was a routine in the ashrams, and that's
what I'm thinking of having for the new commune. In the morning when the
sun is just about to rise, there should be singing, dancing; just as
birds and trees sway in the wind and everybody is agog, waiting for the
sun to come on the horizon, and then suddenly the sun comes. It is a
welcoming song. The most beautiful song is prabhati because it is the
beginning of the day, the beginning of a new day, a new birth.</p><p>In the East we have thought that going to sleep every night is a
small death. It is, because in sleep you completely forget who you are.
If you die in your sleep you will never know when you died or whether
you were ever alive. So sleep is a small death, a mini-death. And every
morning is a mini-birth, a new birth, and you have to praise the lord --
he has given you another day! We are not worthy, we have wasted
yesterday, all the yesterdays. But he is generous, he has given us
another chance to try again, to live, to rejoice, to be total!</p><p>In the East the color orange is the color of the morning, of the
dawn. That's why I have chosen it for my sannyasins. It has to be the
dawn of a new humanity. My sannyasin has to prove that there is a new
man on earth; that is the most essential thing needed today: the
beginning of the new man. The old is finished and gone, the old is
tired, exhausted, spent. We are just somehow carrying the old corpse.
It</p><p>needs to be burned, given a last farewell. We have to say goodbye to
it so that we can welcome the new. The evening songs are goodbye --
saying goodbye to the sun. Maybe we will never see the sun again; so it
is the last goodbye, every day we say a last goodbye. But in the morning
there has to be a welcome song -- that is prabhati.</p><p>Meditation brings you to the beginning of a new birth, an inner
birth; it is the beginning of dawn inside.</p><p>So the outer orange simply represents something of the inside. It is
only through meditation that one can get out of sleep and can enter the
day, because it is only through meditation that one can become awake. So
put your energies into meditation, focus all your energies on
meditation.</p><p>And the morning is never far away; it simply needs the heart to open
a song of welcome, and it is there.</p><p>It is just waiting for you to sing your heart out. The moment you
start dancing the sun cannot resist the temptation to come up on the
horizon.</p><p>I feel sometimes that if one day all the birds decide not to sing,
the sun will not rise. For what? If all the trees decide not to open
their flowers saying, "Let the sun come first," the sun won't come.
There has to be an inner connection; it cannot be a one-sided affair. It
is not only that the sun rises and the flowers open and the birds sing
-- no. Vice versa is also true: the flowers open, the birds sing and the
sun rises. It has to be two-way.</p><p>Life is always interdependent; the poets have felt it. Tennyson said,
"If I could understand a single flower, root and all, then I would
understand the whole universe."</p><p>And he is right -- but this has been only a feeling in the poets.
Mystics have seen it, experienced it, that this is so.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>(Anahato, his new name, means the inner music, Osho told the last
sannyasin.) The inner music has a strange quality. The outer music needs
an instrument, it needs a duality -- the musician and the instrument.
The inner music does not need duality -- the musician is the music. The
musician is the instrument, the musician is all. There is no
division.</p><p>The Zen people call it the sound of one hand clapping. No, one hand
cannot clap. They are simply showing that inside it happens, the sound
of one hand clapping. Two hands are needed to clap. That is the outside
music, two hands clapping. It is easy for two hands to clap; there is a
conflict, there is a struggle, there is a clash. But the inner music,
anahato, means silence, the sound of silence.</p><p>Silence has its own music. It can be heard only by those who have
dropped all noise from the head. It can be heard only by the heart, not
by the head. The heady person goes on missing it. Only the person who is
full of heart, full of love, can hear the music.</p><p>This is the music that helps you to go into the beyond. It becomes a
rainbow bridge. You cannot grasp it with the mind, you cannot comprehend
it with the mind. The mind has to be put aside, completely put aside,
and then suddenly it is there.</p><p>That is the whole art of meditation, putting the mind slowly aside
and getting to the inner music, becoming attuned to the inner world of
oneness. You can call it the experience of god, tao, truth, dhamma, it
is really nothing but the experience of the ultimate music. All names
for it are good, they indicate some quality of it, but it is the hidden
harmony of Heraclitus; that is the same thing.</p><p>To me, Heraclitus is not a philosopher but a mystic and one of the
greatest mystics. The West has completely misunderstood him. He talks
about the hidden harmony, it is hidden in everybody, and once you have
known it inside you, you will be able to know it everywhere else.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=just-the-tip-of-the-iceberg>Just the Tip of the Iceberg</h3><p>Chapter #7</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part5>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

It is for reference purposes only.]\nIt is dangerous, it is insecure, it is going into the unknown. It is only for those who have tremendous courage, it is not for the cowards. For the cowards truth is not possible; they will have to live in lies. They don't deserve truth, they are not worthy of it. They live in fear and they are always afraid to move beyond the familiar. And truth is always beyond the familiar.\nThe familiar is where the crowd lives, in which the crowd lives. The crowd consists of cowards and the crowd is the lowest as far as intelligence is concerned. One cannot fall below that, hence there is no danger, you are walking on plain ground.\nBut when you start moving towards the Himalayan peaks, naturally there is danger; one step wrong and you will be gone forever. But in that very risk one is born, reborn. That very risk gives you sharpness, intelligence, because of the challenge, and without the challenge intelligence goes on gathering rust and dust. When there is challenge; you are constantly alert, aware.\nThe most beautiful thing about danger is it gives you alertness, awareness; hence the people who go climbing an unknown peak, unmapped, are really searching awareness. They are not aware of what they are searching for. The people who\nhave travelled to the North and South poles, taking all kinds of risks, the people who have gone to the moon, are not aware of what their search is really for. They are searching for awareness but their search is not conscious.\nA meditator goes consciously. There is no need to go to the Himalayan peaks or to the moon because there are higher peaks within you and greater distances within you and far more significant stars within you; the whole sky is there, the whole cosmos is there. But it is far more risky than going to the moon or going to Everest.\nThe greatest, the most dangerous, the riskiest space, is within; hence very few people dare to go there.\nFalling from those peaks which are inside you you fall into a deeper abyss than one has ever known before.\nWhen you start knowing something about bliss, at the same time you become aware that if a single step goes wrong you will fall into a darkness into which you have never been. As you move towards the positive the negative also becomes bigger. When you reach the peak the valley is the greatest that surrounds you.\nWhen you were on plain ground there was no valley at all; there was not much risk. Even if you had fallen there was not much risk -- maybe a fracture or two, at the most. But if you fall from the peak you will be shattered, completely shattered.\nBut nobody ever falls from the peaks for the simple reason that as you move higher, you become more 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nalert, more conscious, you become aware of the razor's edge. You are walking on a sword. You are like a tightrope walker who has to be aware, very aware. He has to live in the moment; he cannot think of the past, he cannot think of the future. The moment is enough unto itself; he has to be herenow. Hence there is\nno fall, I have never heard of anybody falling from the peaks. But the danger is there, and because of the danger very few people go into the inward world, the interiority of one's own being.\nThey cling to whatsoever security they have gott money, power, prestige, family, the Rotary Club, the Lion's Club -- where you will not find a single lion, all are sheep. But sheep like to call themselves lions, they like pretending. Comfortable, beautiful lies they live in.\nFriedrich Nietzsche said, \"Don't take away the lies from people, otherwise they will die.\" And in a way he is right that people cannot live without lies, they need comfortable lies; hence Christianity exists, Hinduism exists, Buddhism exists. All these organised religions have nothing to do with truth. Their whole existence depends on there being cowards who constantly need to be comforted, consoled. They don't want the truth because truth means you have to go on a long pilgrimage, the longest journey. But if you have courage the journey becomes smaller.\nThe greater the courage, the shorter is the journey. If the courage is total then in a single step, like sudden lightning, one reaches the peak. It is worth taking all the risks, it is worth it to go into the dangerous, it is worth it to go into the uncharted sea, because it is only through that gambling that one's soul is born, otherwise man lives without a soul. And to live without a soul is not worth anything. It is meaningless, it has no glory, no splendour, no fragrance, no beauty, no bliss. It is monotony, sheer monotony, boredom.\nThe ultimate truth needs a new kind of hearing because god is constantly speaking within you. But we don't hear, we are so full of noise. The mind continuously chatters; day in, day out, whether awake or asleep, it goes on chattering. And there is not only one mind, everybody is carrying many minds.\nThe idea of one mind is absolutely wrong; we don't have one mind, we have many minds. So it is not just a single mind chattering, it is many minds chattering; it is a crowd inside. They are all quarreling with each other, fighting with each other for domination. Each mind wants to be the dominant one.\nAnd in this conflict, confusion, chaos, you cannot hear the still small voice within. It is very clear but it is a whisper: soft, delicate, like a flower, like a breeze. You need a gracious hearing, you need a silence to hear it, a deep\ntranscendence of the mind, a distance from the mind, so that the chattering goes farther and farther away. You can hear it somewhere in the neighbourhood and it goes on receding. As you become more and more silent it fades away. Finally, when you are really silent, there is no mind at all; it has gone so far away, like the farthest star. You cannot hear anything. From the mind now there is nothing, no problem.\nThen suddenly the heart is heard.\nThat is the meaning of Simone: when one listens to one's own heart. The heart does not speak any language; all languages belong to the mind. The heart has its own way of conveying its messages which is not intellectual but intuitive.\nThe word \"intuition\" is beautiful. The mind needs tuition, it needs teachers -- schools, colleges, universities. It needs tuition, it has to be trained by others by the society. Intuition means it is already there; the master is inside you. There is no need to follow the ideas given by others, because they cannot go deeper than the mind, and mind is just the periphery of your being. And the more ideas you gather, the more clumsy you become, because more and more minds are created.\nA scholar is almost in a state of insanity. There are scriptures which he can quote.\nThere was a great orator of England, Ingersoll. He was a very famous orator, very few orators have been of that quality, and he was a very sincere man too. Before he started speaking he would always raise a hand with two fingers sticking up, and when he ended he would raise his other hand with two fingers sticking up.\nEverybody asked \"What is this gesture? What do you mean?\" And he would smile and never answer.\nWhen he was dying one of his friends said, \"Now please, it is a question of only a few minutes or at the most a few hours and you will be gone. Now tell us, what was the secret of your raising two fingers of your left hand at the beginning of each speech and two fingers of your right hand at the end? What was the meaning?\" He said, \"They are inverted commas, because whatsoever I was saying was not my own. I could not say that so I had to hide it, but now I can say I was just repeating others; the whole thing was borrowed.\"\nBut he was a sincere man. At least he made an effort to make it clear that whatsoever he was saying was not his own.\nThe mind has nothing of its own, it is always within inverted commas; whether you know or not, whether you are sincere or not, it is so. Mind is false thing, never original, always borrowed.\nBut the heart is your own, it is your own voice, it is your very being speaking to you. But its 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\ncommunication is not through language. It is a silent communication. It is communion rather than communication.\nOnce the mind is silent nothing is said but everything is heard. Without uttering a single word, for the first time you start moving in the right way, in the right direction. The heart goes on guiding you in subtle ways; you just have to be silent, that's all. And your life is transformed through silence. I teach here only silence and nothing else, because out of silence everything else flowers. One becomes a garden and all kinds of flowers bloom. With the silence comes spring, because with silence comes joy, with silence comes love, with silence comes celebration, with silence comes god, with silence comes truth.\nGod can be attained through two ways: either prayer or meditation. They are different ways, diametrically opposite but, strangely leading to the same experience.\nIf you look at the ways they look antagonistic, and if one thinks logically one will think, how can these contrary thoughts lead to the same goal? But those who have attained have seen that, ultimately, both paths lead to the same goal. And those two paths are needed because there are two types of people in the world.\nHumanity can be divided into two categories: the people who are more interested in love and the people who are more interested in bliss. The person who is interested in love has to follow the path of prayer. Then God is somewhere\noutside and you become a lover or a beloved. Both things have been done in the past.\nThe Indian mystics who followed the path of prayer have always thought of God as the lover and themselves as the beloved. They thought of themselves as feminine because God is the only male. That too has a beauty of its own -- you are just receptive like a woman.\nThe Sufis have done just the opposite. It is the same path but they think of themselves as lovers and God as a beloved. God is the woman -- that too has its beauty. But both are on the path of love. Prayer means the highest form of love. But you have to hypothesize God somewhere outside, then you can relate.\nThe people who are interested in bliss have no need to hypothesize God outside, they have to hypothesize God inside. Buddha, Mahavira -- the whole tradition of Tao mystics and Zen mystics follows the path of meditation. In meditation, you don't need any outside God -- it is self-exploration.\nNow, these two things look totally opposite; one is focussed on the inside God. How can they reach to the same point? -- But they do.\nThe person who thinks of God as being on the outside dissolves himself into his God. He disappears, and the moment he disappears the ego is dropped and there is oneness. That oneness is realization.\nIn meditation you have to discard the ego, you have to become aware of the ego, you have to become watchful of the ego and all its tricks and strategies and cunning ways. As you watch the ego and its subtle ways it starts disappearing. It cannot exist in the light of awareness. Awareness is just like light: you bring light in and the darkness disappears. And the ego is nothing but darkness.\nThe person following the path of love surrenders his ego to God. \"I am not, you are.\" But the same phenomenon happens, the ego is surrendered. And the person on the path of meditation does it through awareness. The same phenomenon happens, the ego disappears. And the moment the ego disappears you have come to find oneness with existence. So both reach the same oneness, both paths lead to the disappearance of duality; the duality is dissolved.\nMy feeling is that, as man becomes more and more mature, the path of meditation has to be more and more implemented.\nA child cannot understand the path of meditation; he can understand the path of love because love is natural. Every child knows what love is. Maybe later on he forgets what it is, but every child knows what love is; it is an intrinsic feel.\nMeditation is for a grown-up person. And humanity has come of age, hence meditation is going to become more significant than prayer in the future. Buddha is going to become more significant than Jesus.\nZen is going to become more predominant than Sufism, Hassidism. Of course a few people will go on following those paths, and nothing is wrong in following them if they appeal to you -- if they fit you. But the more intelligent you are, the more contemporary you are, more is the possibility that you will be easily moved by meditation; hence my emphasis on meditation.\nI help people in prayer only when I see that meditation will not be possible for a certain person. But it is becoming more secondary every day.\nDhyaneshwar means God that is attained through meditation. So remember, meditation is going to be your way.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nExperience is of the mind. Mind deals only with dead things. Experience means something that has already become past. Experiencing means that which is present, which is already here and now, which is a process, not a thing. And this has to be understood about everything that is valuable. Love, bliss, awareness\n-- these are all processes, not things. You are always moving from one perfection to another perfection but the end never comes. It is an endless pilgrimage. The pilgrimage itself is so beautiful that there is no need for any end, the pilgrimage itself is the end.\nNever make any goal in life because life has no goal, hence all goals are false and those who are running after goals are bound to be disappointed. Live life as\na process, not as a dead thing but as something alive, growing, like a tree which is constantly growing; new leaves are always coming, the old are disappearing, the old is constantly replaced by the new. Or like a river which constantly goes on flowing towards the ocean, it is a continuum. Life is a river, love is a river, awareness is a river.\nRemember always, nouns are all false. Existence consists of verbs, not nouns. In fact if we want to make language really true -- true to life, true to reality -- then we have to drop all nouns, all pronouns. Language should consist only of verbs. There is no tree, there is only treeing. There is no river, there is only rivering; there is no life, there is only living; and there is no love, there is only loving.\nThis has to be remembered constantly because the mind tries to make everything a noun. It lives in nouns -- that's why it goes on missing life. It is very happy with dead things because dead things can be easily manipulated. Dead things become objects. You can think about them, you can go round and round them, you can dissect them, you can try to find out what their secret is. But when something is alive mind simply feels impotent.\nYou cannot dissect an alive child. Yes, you can do a post-mortem when somebody is dead. And mind goes on doing post-mortems. It goes on cutting up and analysing corpses. But when a child is dead it is no more the same child. The real has already left; the bird is no more in the cage, only the cage is there. And by dissecting the cage you cannot find the bird.\nThat's why science goes on missing the soul. It goes on missing your centre because it depends on dissection, analysis. Science lives in nouns. A person becomes religious when he becomes aware that all nouns are false, only verbs are real.\nThat is the meaning of Prem Anubhuti: love is an experiencing, it is a process. Never try to make it permanent. Never try to change its natural course, its flow, because a canal is not a river. There is a tremendous difference between the two. The river has freedom, the canal is imprisoned. It only has the appearance of a river.\nMy sannyasins have to understand it as deeply as possible. Never destroy any process by forcing your ideas upon it. Remain spontaneous, alert, receptive, but allowing life its own course, never interfering. Then all bliss is yours and all\nbenediction is yours. Then life is always an ongoing ecstasy, it is a dance of such tremendous beauty and grace that mind is absolutely incapable of comprehending it.\nJust the Tip of the Iceberg Chapter #12\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"3018","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/just_the_tip_of_the_iceberg/part11/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/just_the_tip_of_the_iceberg/>Just The Tip Of The Iceberg</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>15 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;3018 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Just_The_Tip_Of_The_Iceberg/part11.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part10>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

the inward world, the interiority of one's own being.</p><p>They cling to whatsoever security they have gott money, power,
prestige, family, the Rotary Club, the Lion's Club -- where you will not
find a single lion, all are sheep. But sheep like to call themselves
lions, they like pretending. Comfortable, beautiful lies they live
in.</p><p>Friedrich Nietzsche said, "Don't take away the lies from people,
otherwise they will die." And in a way he is right that people cannot
live without lies, they need comfortable lies; hence Christianity
exists, Hinduism exists, Buddhism exists. All these organised religions
have nothing to do with truth. Their whole existence depends on there
being cowards who constantly need to be comforted, consoled. They don't
want the truth because truth means you have to go on a long pilgrimage,
the longest journey. But if you have courage the journey becomes
smaller.</p><p>The greater the courage, the shorter is the journey. If the courage
is total then in a single step, like sudden lightning, one reaches the
peak. It is worth taking all the risks, it is worth it to go into the
dangerous, it is worth it to go into the uncharted sea, because it is
only through that gambling that one's soul is born, otherwise man lives
without a soul. And to live without a soul is not worth anything. It is
meaningless, it has no glory, no splendour, no fragrance, no beauty, no
bliss. It is monotony, sheer monotony, boredom.</p><p>The ultimate truth needs a new kind of hearing because god is
constantly speaking within you. But we don't hear, we are so full of
noise. The mind continuously chatters; day in, day out, whether awake or
asleep, it goes on chattering. And there is not only one mind, everybody
is carrying many minds.</p><p>The idea of one mind is absolutely wrong; we don't have one mind, we
have many minds. So it is not just a single mind chattering, it is many
minds chattering; it is a crowd inside. They are all quarreling with
each other, fighting with each other for domination. Each mind wants to
be the dominant one.</p><p>And in this conflict, confusion, chaos, you cannot hear the still
small voice within. It is very clear but it is a whisper: soft,
delicate, like a flower, like a breeze. You need a gracious hearing, you
need a silence to hear it, a deep</p><p>transcendence of the mind, a distance from the mind, so that the
chattering goes farther and farther away. You can hear it somewhere in
the neighbourhood and it goes on receding. As you become more and more
silent it fades away. Finally, when you are really silent, there is no
mind at all; it has gone so far away, like the farthest star. You cannot
hear anything. From the mind now there is nothing, no problem.</p><p>Then suddenly the heart is heard.</p><p>That is the meaning of Simone: when one listens to one's own heart.
The heart does not speak any language; all languages belong to the mind.
The heart has its own way of conveying its messages which is not
intellectual but intuitive.</p><p>The word "intuition" is beautiful. The mind needs tuition, it needs
teachers -- schools, colleges, universities. It needs tuition, it has to
be trained by others by the society. Intuition means it is already
there; the master is inside you. There is no need to follow the ideas
given by others, because they cannot go deeper than the mind, and mind
is just the periphery of your being. And the more ideas you gather, the
more clumsy you become, because more and more minds are created.</p><p>A scholar is almost in a state of insanity. There are scriptures
which he can quote.</p><p>There was a great orator of England, Ingersoll. He was a very famous
orator, very few orators have been of that quality, and he was a very
sincere man too. Before he started speaking he would always raise a hand
with two fingers sticking up, and when he ended he would raise his other
hand with two fingers sticking up.</p><p>Everybody asked "What is this gesture? What do you mean?" And he
would smile and never answer.</p><p>When he was dying one of his friends said, "Now please, it is a
question of only a few minutes or at the most a few hours and you will
be gone. Now tell us, what was the secret of your raising two fingers of
your left hand at the beginning of each speech and two fingers of your
right hand at the end? What was the meaning?" He said, "They are
inverted commas, because whatsoever I was saying was not my own. I could
not say that so I had to hide it, but now I can say I was just repeating
others; the whole thing was borrowed."</p><p>But he was a sincere man. At least he made an effort to make it clear
that whatsoever he was saying was not his own.</p><p>The mind has nothing of its own, it is always within inverted commas;
whether you know or not, whether you are sincere or not, it is so. Mind
is false thing, never original, always borrowed.</p><p>But the heart is your own, it is your own voice, it is your very
being speaking to you. But its 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>communication is not through language. It is a silent communication.
It is communion rather than communication.</p><p>Once the mind is silent nothing is said but everything is heard.
Without uttering a single word, for the first time you start moving in
the right way, in the right direction. The heart goes on guiding you in
subtle ways; you just have to be silent, that's all. And your life is
transformed through silence. I teach here only silence and nothing else,
because out of silence everything else flowers. One becomes a garden and
all kinds of flowers bloom. With the silence comes spring, because with
silence comes joy, with silence comes love, with silence comes
celebration, with silence comes god, with silence comes truth.</p><p>God can be attained through two ways: either prayer or meditation.
They are different ways, diametrically opposite but, strangely leading
to the same experience.</p><p>If you look at the ways they look antagonistic, and if one thinks
logically one will think, how can these contrary thoughts lead to the
same goal? But those who have attained have seen that, ultimately, both
paths lead to the same goal. And those two paths are needed because
there are two types of people in the world.</p><p>Humanity can be divided into two categories: the people who are more
interested in love and the people who are more interested in bliss. The
person who is interested in love has to follow the path of prayer. Then
God is somewhere</p><p>outside and you become a lover or a beloved. Both things have been
done in the past.</p><p>The Indian mystics who followed the path of prayer have always
thought of God as the lover and themselves as the beloved. They thought
of themselves as feminine because God is the only male. That too has a
beauty of its own -- you are just receptive like a woman.</p><p>The Sufis have done just the opposite. It is the same path but they
think of themselves as lovers and God as a beloved. God is the woman --
that too has its beauty. But both are on the path of love. Prayer means
the highest form of love. But you have to hypothesize God somewhere
outside, then you can relate.</p><p>The people who are interested in bliss have no need to hypothesize
God outside, they have to hypothesize God inside. Buddha, Mahavira --
the whole tradition of Tao mystics and Zen mystics follows the path of
meditation. In meditation, you don't need any outside God -- it is
self-exploration.</p><p>Now, these two things look totally opposite; one is focussed on the
inside God. How can they reach to the same point? -- But they do.</p><p>The person who thinks of God as being on the outside dissolves
himself into his God. He disappears, and the moment he disappears the
ego is dropped and there is oneness. That oneness is realization.</p><p>In meditation you have to discard the ego, you have to become aware
of the ego, you have to become watchful of the ego and all its tricks
and strategies and cunning ways. As you watch the ego and its subtle
ways it starts disappearing. It cannot exist in the light of awareness.
Awareness is just like light: you bring light in and the darkness
disappears. And the ego is nothing but darkness.</p><p>The person following the path of love surrenders his ego to God. "I
am not, you are." But the same phenomenon happens, the ego is
surrendered. And the person on the path of meditation does it through
awareness. The same phenomenon happens, the ego disappears. And the
moment the ego disappears you have come to find oneness with existence.
So both reach the same oneness, both paths lead to the disappearance of
duality; the duality is dissolved.</p><p>My feeling is that, as man becomes more and more mature, the path of
meditation has to be more and more implemented.</p><p>A child cannot understand the path of meditation; he can understand
the path of love because love is natural. Every child knows what love
is. Maybe later on he forgets what it is, but every child knows what
love is; it is an intrinsic feel.</p><p>Meditation is for a grown-up person. And humanity has come of age,
hence meditation is going to become more significant than prayer in the
future. Buddha is going to become more significant than Jesus.</p><p>Zen is going to become more predominant than Sufism, Hassidism. Of
course a few people will go on following those paths, and nothing is
wrong in following them if they appeal to you -- if they fit you. But
the more intelligent you are, the more contemporary you are, more is the
possibility that you will be easily moved by meditation; hence my
emphasis on meditation.</p><p>I help people in prayer only when I see that meditation will not be
possible for a certain person. But it is becoming more secondary every
day.</p><p>Dhyaneshwar means God that is attained through meditation. So
remember, meditation is going to be your way.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on

Experience means something that has already become past. Experiencing
means that which is present, which is already here and now, which is a
process, not a thing. And this has to be understood about everything
that is valuable. Love, bliss, awareness</p><p>-- these are all processes, not things. You are always moving from
one perfection to another perfection but the end never comes. It is an
endless pilgrimage. The pilgrimage itself is so beautiful that there is
no need for any end, the pilgrimage itself is the end.</p><p>Never make any goal in life because life has no goal, hence all goals
are false and those who are running after goals are bound to be
disappointed. Live life as</p><p>a process, not as a dead thing but as something alive, growing, like
a tree which is constantly growing; new leaves are always coming, the
old are disappearing, the old is constantly replaced by the new. Or like
a river which constantly goes on flowing towards the ocean, it is a
continuum. Life is a river, love is a river, awareness is a river.</p><p>Remember always, nouns are all false. Existence consists of verbs,
not nouns. In fact if we want to make language really true -- true to
life, true to reality -- then we have to drop all nouns, all pronouns.
Language should consist only of verbs. There is no tree, there is only
treeing. There is no river, there is only rivering; there is no life,
there is only living; and there is no love, there is only loving.</p><p>This has to be remembered constantly because the mind tries to make
everything a noun. It lives in nouns -- that's why it goes on missing
life. It is very happy with dead things because dead things can be
easily manipulated. Dead things become objects. You can think about
them, you can go round and round them, you can dissect them, you can try
to find out what their secret is. But when something is alive mind
simply feels impotent.</p><p>You cannot dissect an alive child. Yes, you can do a post-mortem when
somebody is dead. And mind goes on doing post-mortems. It goes on
cutting up and analysing corpses. But when a child is dead it is no more
the same child. The real has already left; the bird is no more in the
cage, only the cage is there. And by dissecting the cage you cannot find
the bird.</p><p>That's why science goes on missing the soul. It goes on missing your
centre because it depends on dissection, analysis. Science lives in
nouns. A person becomes religious when he becomes aware that all nouns
are false, only verbs are real.</p><p>That is the meaning of Prem Anubhuti: love is an experiencing, it is
a process. Never try to make it permanent. Never try to change its
natural course, its flow, because a canal is not a river. There is a
tremendous difference between the two. The river has freedom, the canal
is imprisoned. It only has the appearance of a river.</p><p>My sannyasins have to understand it as deeply as possible. Never
destroy any process by forcing your ideas upon it. Remain spontaneous,
alert, receptive, but allowing life its own course, never interfering.
Then all bliss is yours and all</p><p>benediction is yours. Then life is always an ongoing ecstasy, it is a
dance of such tremendous beauty and grace that mind is absolutely
incapable of comprehending it.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:justify id=just-the-tip-of-the-iceberg>Just the Tip of the Iceberg</h3><p>Chapter #12</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part10>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

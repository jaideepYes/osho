One cannot seek truth through thinking because thinking is an unconscious activity. It is groping in the dark.\nOnly when one is conscious, alert, aware, does seeing begin. Thinking is not seeing; it is a substitute for seeing. The blind man thinks about light but the man who can see, sees light. He does not think about it, there is no need to think about it.\nThe man who has not known love thinks about it, the man who has tasted love knows it knowing and thinking are two diametrically opposite processes. Thinking is not knowing -- and we go on thinking about truth. That is not the way for the seeker.\nThe seeker has to drop thinking and become aware. And awareness is possible only when you drop thinking, when there is no thought in your consciousness, your consciousness is pure, uncontaminated, unpolluted. In that clarity everything is revealed. All the mysteries of life, all the secrets of existence, are 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- yours.\n(It's the greatest love, that of truth, Osho went on to say.) People live in comfortable lies. They don't want truth, they want consolations, cosy consolations; hence they remain clinging to superstitions, to traditions, to conventions, because all that is old has a certain prestige, a certain credit in the marketplace. All that is old, they say, is gold. It is not so.\nThe old looks gold only to the fools, to the cowards.\nLife is new every moment, it is never old. Existence is always now and here. It has nothing to do with the past and nothing to do with the future either. The moment you are also now and here there is a meeting\n-- and that meeting becomes the truth. Of course it will shatter many illusions, it will shatter many ideologies, it will shatter all conceptions, a priori beliefs, because truth cannot fit with you, truth cannot compromise with you and your ideas about it. You have to be ready to fit with truth itself. That's what I call love for truth, a readiness to go with truth wherever it leads, and whatsoever needs to be dropped one is ready to drop. That is possible only if there is love for truth.\nLove can do everything, love can sacrifice everything -- and truth requires total sacrifice, total commitment.\nSannyas is the journey of love towards truth. So I am here to shatter all your beliefs, ideas, conceptions, projections. In a way my work looks very hard, harsh, because I have to cut out many chunks which you have believed to be your very being.\nThe work of a master is exactly like that of a sculptor: he has to cut the rock and he has to be very hard.\nOnly by his hardness, by cutting out all that is non-essential, is he capable of transforming the rock into a beautiful statue.\nWhen you come to me you come as a raw diamond. It needs much cutting, much polishing, only then will you shine in your splendour. When you come to me you come full of superstitions -- Christian, Hindu, Mohammedan, Buddhist, Communist. I have to destroy all those, mercilessly, because only then can I help you to discover your real being.\nFrom your side sannyas means a green signal to go ahead.\n(We're here to die -- and born tomorrow. Sujate, Patricia's new name, gave Osho the opportunity to talk about the second birth a sannyasin passes through.)\nThe first birth is only a so-called birth. It only gives you an opportunity, a potential. Unless the second birth happens you are not well-born, you are only half-born. Many people think that they are fully born with the first birth. They are deceiving themselves. They will die without knowing anything about life, without knowing what it really was to be. They will only vegetate. They will exist but their existence will not have anything of value. It will be a very superficial existence -- routine, mundane.\nA second birth is needed and that birth happens through love because love means only one thing, the dropping of the ego.\nWith the first birth you cannot drop the ego. In fact, each child has to learn the language of the ego just to survive. It is only for a grown-up person to decide, to choose, whether to live in the ego or to drop it and live in total humbleness.\nJesus is right when he says, \"Blessed are the meek for theirs is the kingdom of god.\" By meek he means those who are without any ego. And the only magic that can help you to drop the ego is love.\nJesus also says, \"Unless you are born again you will not enter into my kingdom of god.\" That's exactly the meaning of Sujate: unless you are born again. And love is going to be the very process of your second birth.\nSannyas, to really be a transformation, a revolution, has to be nothing but a jump, a quantum leap into the mysterious dimension of love.\nDrop the ego. Don't think you are separate from existence. Ego creates walls, love creates bridges.\nDestroy all walls and use the same material, the same bricks, to create bridges.\nIt is the same material that creates the ego. Dismantle it and use the same material in making bridges.\nAnd make as many bridges as possible. The more bridges you have with existence, the more rich you are.\nWhen you are related totally you are liberated: liberated from all sleep, somnambulism, unconsciousness.\nYour life becomes full of light.\nLove, and you will know what light is. Love, and you will know what life is. Love, and you will know what god is.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\n(Osho warned us that although meditation is a must, it must be dropped at some point. He was addressing Dhyanbodhi, a truck driver from Holland.)\nMeditation is a method, a means. Awareness is the end, the goal. Meditation is only a key. It opens the door and then you enter into the world of awareness.\nMeditation is not an end unto itself, so when you have attained to awareness meditation disappears.\nMeditation is complete only when it can be dropped, when you need not meditate any more, then meditation has come to its ultimate peak, it has released your awareness. Its work is done.\nIt is a ladder or a boat: you reach the other shore and the boat is no more needed. You simply say thank you to the boat. Of course it has done much for you, you feel grateful, but there is no need to become attached to it, there is no need to\ncarry the boat on your head wherever you go. When you have crossed the bridge, the bridge is no more needed. When you have climbed the ladder and reached a higher plane you forget all about the ladder.\nThere are two types of people in the world who are interested in meditation. They can be divided into two categories.\nOne type is people like Maharishi Mahesh Yogi; their idea is that meditation is the goal. Then the other category is like J. Krishnamurti who says meditation is not needed at all. Both are right in a way and both are also wrong in a way. They are both telling half the truth.\nMahesh Yogi is telling the first part of the truth: meditation is needed, and he is right. But it is not needed forever, it is just a means. And the meditator has to be aware of it from the very beginning otherwise he will become attached, obsessed with meditation itself. Then it becomes a ritual. Then it is no more of help, it becomes a hindrance.\nIf you cling to the ladder, even if you have reached the top rung of the ladder and you cling to that, you have not reached the higher plane. Unless you leave the ladder behind you will not be able to move on the higher plane.\nKrishnamurti is too cautious about this fear, because many meditators become attached to their meditation, so he says there is no need for meditation. But if there is no need for meditation you will remain on the lower level. Without the ladder you cannot reach the higher level.\nMy approach is total. I say meditation is needed and I also say a moment comes when meditation has to be dropped. And that is the meaning of your name, Dhyanbodhi.\nDhyan means meditation -- that is the beginning part, half, and Bodhi means awareness -- that is the last part, the other half, the other side of the coin. That's why Zen people say effortless effort: effort is needed but they remind you again and again not to become attached to it, hence the paradox of effortless effort. And I agree with the Zen approach towards life. It is a whole approach, more wholesome than any approach that has ever existed on earth.\n(Then he enlarged on the nature of awareness.)\nAwareness is what the alchemists have been searching for -- the elixir, the nectar, the magical formula that can help you to become an immortal.\nIn fact everybody is immortal but we are living in a mortal body and we are so close to the body that the identity arises. There is no distance to see the body as separate. We are so immersed in the body, rooted in the body, that we start feeling we are the body -- and then the problem arises: we start becoming afraid of death. Then all the fears, all the nightmares, come in its wake.\nAwareness creates the distance between you and your body. It makes you watchful of both your own body and mind, because body and mind are not separate. Body-mind is one entity, the mind is the inside of the body. And when you become aware of body-mind you immediately know you are separate from both and the distance starts happening. Then you know you are immortal, you are not part of time, you are part of the eternal, that there is no birth for you and no death either, that you have always been here and you will always be here. You have been in many bodies because you desired so much.\nEach desire brings you back into a body because without a body no desire car. be fulfilled. If one is very much attached to food one will need a body; without a body you cannot enjoy food -- souls are not known to eat food. So a person who is too greedy for food is bound to come back in a body. Or the person who is too attached to sexual pleasures is bound to come back in a body, because nobody has ever heard... Except for one thing, that the holy ghost created Jesus Christ.… Otherwise no ghost has ever been able to do anything like that. And it is just a myth: ghosts cannot do it. Even if they want to do it they will have to possess 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nsomebody's body. Without a body there is no possibility of any pleasure, any fulfilment of any desire.\nSo when all desires disappear you will not come back into the body but you will remain in the universal consciousness as part of the infinity. That's what we in the East call nirvana, the ultimate state of consciousness, when there is no need\nfor any body, no need to be imprisoned again. We call it the ultimate freedom, because to be in a body is a bondage. Of course it is a very limited thing and you are unlimited; it is forcing the unlimited into such a limited, small world of the body. That's why there is constant tension, uneasiness, and one goes on feeling crippled, one goes on feeling crushed, crowded, imprisoned, chained.\nOne may not be exactly aware of it but vaguely everybody feels something is wrong. This is what is wrong: we are infinite and are trying to exist through the very small world of the body.\nAwareness frees you from the body. And the moment you know you are not the body, in that very moment all desires that can be fulfilled through the body also disappear. It is like bringing light into a dark room -- darkness disappears. Awareness functions like light and all desires are nothing but darkness. And it is nectar.\nSannyas is an alchemical phenomenon. Our search is for that ultimate transmutation in which the mortal experiences immortality.\n(Osho continued on the subject of awareness when explaining the meaning of her name to Gyanbodhi.) There is a possibility of becoming knowledgeable without awareness. But knowledgeability is not wisdom, it is mere information -- borrowed, and anything borrowed is ugly, anything borrowed is a burden.\nIt does not enhance your growth, it hinders it, it blocks it.\nTrue knowledge, wisdom, happens through awareness -- not by accumulating information but by going through a transformation. Awareness is a radical transformation; you are born anew.\nOrdinarily one exists in a very sleepy state. One is aware very minimally, just one percent or not even that. It is enough for your day-to-day work, it is enough to earn your bread and to make a shelter and to have children and a family. It is enough for that, but more than that is not possible. Ninety-nine per cent is just darkness in you. And all that darkness can be changed, one can be full of light. And then one knows the intensity of living, the tremendous ecstasy of living.\nSannyas means putting your total energy into awakening. Just a total effort is needed -- passionate, intense. From this moment think of awareness as a question of life and death. In fact it is a question of life and death. Without\nawareness you are simply dying every day; with awareness you start living for the first time and then life goes on growing bigger and bigger, vaster and vaster.\nOne day it is so abundant that not only are you alive, whosoever comes close to you, he becomes alive.\nYou start imparting some magic to others too, you start overflowing with life, love, light. And that is a state of a Buddha, of a Christ, of a wise man or a wise woman.\nIn English there is no good word for wise woman. Somehow the word has become very much associated with wrong things -- witch. A witch really means a wise woman. And you will find many witches around here. (laughter) But they are wise women, remember, not witches in the western sense of the word.\nSo become a witch!\n(Then he ended on a rather more juicy note -- that of love.) Love is the most blessed state because it is a state beyond the mind. Mind is logic. Logic is a very low phenomenon -- worldly, materialistic. Logic is mathematics; and life is not logic, it is far more than logic.\nLife is love, life is a mystery. No logic is able to measure it. No logic can fathom its depth or its height.\nLife remains a mystery for logic, because the very beginning of logic is to take life as a problem -- and it is not a problem.\nA problem can be solved; a mystery cannot be solved, it is unsolvable. Love knows how to live the mystery; it is not bothered about solving it, it is not even bothered about understanding it. Its whole approach is how to live it in its totality, how to go into it deeply, fully, not holding anything back. Love is a quantum leap. It is great courage. One needs a gambler's heart and one also needs the quality of a drunkard.\nThe calculative person cannot love, he is cunning; and love needs simplicity. The calculative person is always a Jew, whether he knows it or not -- that is not the point, whether he is born a Jew or not -- that is not the point. He is a businessman, he always thinks in terms of profit. And love is not a profitable business, it is not a business at all. It is living life without the attitude of a\nbusinessman.\nIt is living life as a poet, as a musician, as an artist; as a lover -- and then life reveals all its mysteries and one becomes more rich as one becomes more capable of love.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nLove unconditionally, love all, without any discrimination. Love for love's sake, not bothering about any reason -- and then you will know what god is. It is only to the lover's heart that god becomes available. For the logician god is non- existential, for the lover only god exists. That's why Jesus says god is love. He is absolutely right.\nAnd I don't thing anybody before him has made such a pregnant statement. That one statement is enough to prove that this man knew that he was talking of something that he had known himself. It was not borrowed, it was not in any scripture of the world. No other enlightened person has ever said that before.\nAnd because of such statements he was crucified; he was going against the whole tradition and convention.\nA real master always goes against the conventional, the traditional. He is bound to because with him the whole existence moves a step forward, closer to god. own observation is that love is the most blessed phenomenon.\nBlessed are those who know what love is, for theirs is the kingdom of god.\nJust the Tip of the Iceberg Chapter #24\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"3071","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/just_the_tip_of_the_iceberg/part23/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/just_the_tip_of_the_iceberg/>Just The Tip Of The Iceberg</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>15 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;3071 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Just_The_Tip_Of_The_Iceberg/part23.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part22>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

cut the rock and he has to be very hard.</p><p>Only by his hardness, by cutting out all that is non-essential, is he
capable of transforming the rock into a beautiful statue.</p><p>When you come to me you come as a raw diamond. It needs much cutting,
much polishing, only then will you shine in your splendour. When you
come to me you come full of superstitions -- Christian, Hindu,
Mohammedan, Buddhist, Communist. I have to destroy all those,
mercilessly, because only then can I help you to discover your real
being.</p><p>From your side sannyas means a green signal to go ahead.</p><p>(We're here to die -- and born tomorrow. Sujate, Patricia's new name,
gave Osho the opportunity to talk about the second birth a sannyasin
passes through.)</p><p>The first birth is only a so-called birth. It only gives you an
opportunity, a potential. Unless the second birth happens you are not
well-born, you are only half-born. Many people think that they are fully
born with the first birth. They are deceiving themselves. They will die
without knowing anything about life, without knowing what it really was
to be. They will only vegetate. They will exist but their existence will
not have anything of value. It will be a very superficial existence --
routine, mundane.</p><p>A second birth is needed and that birth happens through love because
love means only one thing, the dropping of the ego.</p><p>With the first birth you cannot drop the ego. In fact, each child has
to learn the language of the ego just to survive. It is only for a
grown-up person to decide, to choose, whether to live in the ego or to
drop it and live in total humbleness.</p><p>Jesus is right when he says, "Blessed are the meek for theirs is the
kingdom of god." By meek he means those who are without any ego. And the
only magic that can help you to drop the ego is love.</p><p>Jesus also says, "Unless you are born again you will not enter into
my kingdom of god." That's exactly the meaning of Sujate: unless you are
born again. And love is going to be the very process of your second
birth.</p><p>Sannyas, to really be a transformation, a revolution, has to be
nothing but a jump, a quantum leap into the mysterious dimension of
love.</p><p>Drop the ego. Don't think you are separate from existence. Ego
creates walls, love creates bridges.</p><p>Destroy all walls and use the same material, the same bricks, to
create bridges.</p><p>It is the same material that creates the ego. Dismantle it and use
the same material in making bridges.</p><p>And make as many bridges as possible. The more bridges you have with
existence, the more rich you are.</p><p>When you are related totally you are liberated: liberated from all
sleep, somnambulism, unconsciousness.</p><p>Your life becomes full of light.</p><p>Love, and you will know what light is. Love, and you will know what
life is. Love, and you will know what god is.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>(Osho warned us that although meditation is a must, it must be
dropped at some point. He was addressing Dhyanbodhi, a truck driver from
Holland.)</p><p>Meditation is a method, a means. Awareness is the end, the goal.
Meditation is only a key. It opens the door and then you enter into the
world of awareness.</p><p>Meditation is not an end unto itself, so when you have attained to
awareness meditation disappears.</p><p>Meditation is complete only when it can be dropped, when you need not
meditate any more, then meditation has come to its ultimate peak, it has
released your awareness. Its work is done.</p><p>It is a ladder or a boat: you reach the other shore and the boat is
no more needed. You simply say thank you to the boat. Of course it has
done much for you, you feel grateful, but there is no need to become
attached to it, there is no need to</p><p>carry the boat on your head wherever you go. When you have crossed
the bridge, the bridge is no more needed. When you have climbed the
ladder and reached a higher plane you forget all about the ladder.</p><p>There are two types of people in the world who are interested in
meditation. They can be divided into two categories.</p><p>One type is people like Maharishi Mahesh Yogi; their idea is that
meditation is the goal. Then the other category is like J. Krishnamurti
who says meditation is not needed at all. Both are right in a way and
both are also wrong in a way. They are both telling half the truth.</p><p>Mahesh Yogi is telling the first part of the truth: meditation is
needed, and he is right. But it is not needed forever, it is just a
means. And the meditator has to be aware of it from the very beginning
otherwise he will become attached, obsessed with meditation itself. Then
it becomes a ritual. Then it is no more of help, it becomes a
hindrance.</p><p>If you cling to the ladder, even if you have reached the top rung of
the ladder and you cling to that, you have not reached the higher plane.
Unless you leave the ladder behind you will not be able to move on the
higher plane.</p><p>Krishnamurti is too cautious about this fear, because many meditators
become attached to their meditation, so he says there is no need for
meditation. But if there is no need for meditation you will remain on
the lower level. Without the ladder you cannot reach the higher
level.</p><p>My approach is total. I say meditation is needed and I also say a
moment comes when meditation has to be dropped. And that is the meaning
of your name, Dhyanbodhi.</p><p>Dhyan means meditation -- that is the beginning part, half, and Bodhi
means awareness -- that is the last part, the other half, the other side
of the coin. That's why Zen people say effortless effort: effort is
needed but they remind you again and again not to become attached to it,
hence the paradox of effortless effort. And I agree with the Zen
approach towards life. It is a whole approach, more wholesome than any
approach that has ever existed on earth.</p><p>(Then he enlarged on the nature of awareness.)</p><p>Awareness is what the alchemists have been searching for -- the
elixir, the nectar, the magical formula that can help you to become an
immortal.</p><p>In fact everybody is immortal but we are living in a mortal body and
we are so close to the body that the identity arises. There is no
distance to see the body as separate. We are so immersed in the body,
rooted in the body, that we start feeling we are the body -- and then
the problem arises: we start becoming afraid of death. Then all the
fears, all the nightmares, come in its wake.</p><p>Awareness creates the distance between you and your body. It makes
you watchful of both your own body and mind, because body and mind are
not separate. Body-mind is one entity, the mind is the inside of the
body. And when you become aware of body-mind you immediately know you
are separate from both and the distance starts happening. Then you know
you are immortal, you are not part of time, you are part of the eternal,
that there is no birth for you and no death either, that you have always
been here and you will always be here. You have been in many bodies
because you desired so much.</p><p>Each desire brings you back into a body because without a body no
desire car. be fulfilled. If one is very much attached to food one will
need a body; without a body you cannot enjoy food -- souls are not known
to eat food. So a person who is too greedy for food is bound to come
back in a body. Or the person who is too attached to sexual pleasures is
bound to come back in a body, because nobody has ever heard... Except
for one thing, that the holy ghost created Jesus Christ.… Otherwise no
ghost has ever been able to do anything like that. And it is just a
myth: ghosts cannot do it. Even if they want to do it they will have to
possess 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on

pleasure, any fulfilment of any desire.</p><p>So when all desires disappear you will not come back into the body
but you will remain in the universal consciousness as part of the
infinity. That's what we in the East call nirvana, the ultimate state of
consciousness, when there is no need</p><p>for any body, no need to be imprisoned again. We call it the ultimate
freedom, because to be in a body is a bondage. Of course it is a very
limited thing and you are unlimited; it is forcing the unlimited into
such a limited, small world of the body. That's why there is constant
tension, uneasiness, and one goes on feeling crippled, one goes on
feeling crushed, crowded, imprisoned, chained.</p><p>One may not be exactly aware of it but vaguely everybody feels
something is wrong. This is what is wrong: we are infinite and are
trying to exist through the very small world of the body.</p><p>Awareness frees you from the body. And the moment you know you are
not the body, in that very moment all desires that can be fulfilled
through the body also disappear. It is like bringing light into a dark
room -- darkness disappears. Awareness functions like light and all
desires are nothing but darkness. And it is nectar.</p><p>Sannyas is an alchemical phenomenon. Our search is for that ultimate
transmutation in which the mortal experiences immortality.</p><p>(Osho continued on the subject of awareness when explaining the
meaning of her name to Gyanbodhi.) There is a possibility of becoming
knowledgeable <em>without</em> awareness. But knowledgeability is not
wisdom, it is mere information -- borrowed, and anything borrowed is
ugly, anything borrowed is a burden.</p><p>It does not enhance your growth, it hinders it, it blocks it.</p><p>True knowledge, wisdom, happens through awareness -- not by
accumulating information but by going through a transformation.
Awareness is a radical transformation; you are born anew.</p><p>Ordinarily one exists in a very sleepy state. One is aware very
minimally, just one percent or not even that. It is enough for your
day-to-day work, it is enough to earn your bread and to make a shelter
and to have children and a family. It is enough for that, but more than
that is not possible. Ninety-nine per cent is just darkness in you. And
all that darkness can be changed, one can be full of light. And then one
knows the intensity of living, the tremendous ecstasy of living.</p><p>Sannyas means putting your total energy into awakening. Just a total
effort is needed -- passionate, intense. From this moment think of
awareness as a question of life and death. In fact it is a question of
life and death. Without</p><p>awareness you are simply dying every day; with awareness you start
living for the first time and then life goes on growing bigger and
bigger, vaster and vaster.</p><p>One day it is so abundant that not only are you alive, whosoever
comes close to you, <em>he</em> becomes alive.</p><p>You start imparting some magic to others too, you start overflowing
with life, love, light. And that is a state of a Buddha, of a Christ, of
a wise man or a wise woman.</p><p>In English there is no good word for wise woman. Somehow the word has
become very much associated with wrong things -- witch. A witch really
means a wise woman. And you will find many witches around here.
(laughter) But they are wise women, remember, not witches in the western
sense of the word.</p><p>So become a witch!</p><p>(Then he ended on a rather more juicy note -- that of love.) Love is
the most blessed state because it is a state beyond the mind. Mind is
logic. Logic is a very low phenomenon -- worldly, materialistic. Logic
is mathematics; and life is not logic, it is far more than logic.</p><p>Life is love, life is a mystery. No logic is able to measure it. No
logic can fathom its depth or its height.</p><p>Life remains a mystery for logic, because the very beginning of logic
is to take life as a problem -- and it is not a problem.</p><p>A problem can be solved; a mystery cannot be solved, it is
unsolvable. Love knows how to live the mystery; it is not bothered about
solving it, it is not even bothered about understanding it. Its whole
approach is how to live it in its totality, how to go into it deeply,
fully, not holding anything back. Love is a quantum leap. It is great
courage. One needs a gambler's heart and one also needs the quality of a
drunkard.</p><p>The calculative person cannot love, he is cunning; and love needs
simplicity. The calculative person is always a Jew, whether he knows it
or not -- that is not the point, whether he is born a Jew or not -- that
is not the point. He is a businessman, he always thinks in terms of
profit. And love is not a profitable business, it is not a business at
all. It is living life without the attitude of a</p><p>businessman.</p><p>It is living life as a poet, as a musician, as an artist; as a lover
-- and then life reveals all its mysteries and one becomes more rich as
one becomes more capable of love.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on

love's sake, not bothering about any reason -- and then you will know
what god is. It is only to the lover's heart that god becomes available.
For the logician god is non- existential, for the lover only god exists.
That's why Jesus says god is love. He is absolutely right.</p><p>And I don't thing anybody before him has made such a pregnant
statement. That one statement is enough to prove that this man knew that
he was talking of something that he had known himself. It was not
borrowed, it was not in any scripture of the world. No other enlightened
person has ever said that before.</p><p>And because of such statements he was crucified; he was going against
the whole tradition and convention.</p><p>A real master always goes against the conventional, the traditional.

forward, closer to god. own observation is that love is the most blessed
phenomenon.</p><p>Blessed are those who know what love is, for theirs is the kingdom of

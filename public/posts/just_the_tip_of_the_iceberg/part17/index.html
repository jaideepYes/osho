It is for reference purposes only.]\nThe bear is a symbol of resurrection, and meditation begins in courage and ends in resurrection. The coward cannot meditate because the first requirement of meditation is to be absolutely alone. Not that one has to go to the mountains -- that is not real aloneness. One has to go inwards; it is not an outward journey at all. But to go in means to leave everybody out. You cannot be accompanied by your friends, by your beloved; nobody can go with you. And that creates fear, hence very few people ever try to go in.\nEverybody is interested in travelling, people are even interested in going to the moon where nothing is to be found. But the inner journey which can give you a new life, a resurrection, is not even attempted by millions -- not even thought about, not even dreamt about, for the simple reason that it needs guts, courage.\nYou will be all alone, absolutely alone. The whole world will disappear as if it exists not. The deeper you go, the more illusory the world becomes, as if you had seen it in a dream and it is no more. You are so alone that nobody else exists. But this is a basic requirement to be fulfilled.\nCourage is the foundation of all religious growth, of all spiritual growth. And if one is courageous enough, then of course one can have infinite bliss, one can\nhave absolute freedom, one can have divine life.\nThat is resurrection: dying to the old pattern, the old gestalt, the old you, and beginning anew. It is a rebirth.\nSannyas is the whole process of rebirthing.\n(The pointer in Prem Wolfgang's name was that love takes guts!)\n... because you can love only if you are ready to drop the ego -- and that is the hardest thing in life to do, the most difficult thing;. One can renounce money, family, power, prestige, everything, but when it comes to renouncing; the ego it becomes almost impossible -- -not impossible, but almost impossible. One can renounce money because the ego can en joy it: \"Look how much I have renounced!\" You can renounce the family, the society; you can go to the mountains or to a monastery, and the ego will be going with you, rejoicing that \"I am not an ordinary person -- am a holy man!\"\nBut when it comes to renouncing the ego, the ego resists. It gives you a tough fight, a tough time. You push it out from one side, it comes back in from another side. You throw it out from the front door, it comes in from the' back door. You try to be humble, it enters your humility; it starts bragging about humility. It says, \"Look! There is nobody more humble than me!\" Its names are very subtle.\nOne needs courage because it is almost like dying. It is a death in a way, because we have lived with the ego, we have become so identified with it -- there is not even an inch's difference. It is not like taking your clothes off, it is like peeling your skin -- it hurts. Hence courage is needed, clarity is needed, understanding is needed, awareness is needed, and tremendous love is needed, trust is needed. Unless you know what love is you will not be able to drop the ego.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nSo many so-called saints have failed for the simple reason that they tried to drop\nthe ego but they never tried simultaneously to grow towards love. Then where will your energy go? If you drop the ego, great energy is released, and if you are against love then that energy will go on again creating a new ego.\nSo these are two parts of the same process: drop the ego and put your total energy into love so that nothing is left for the ego to survive on, so there is no nourishment left and it dies of starvation. As the ego dies your love explodes. And to know love is to know god. To love is the only religion. One need not be a Christian or a Hindu or a Mohammedan, one only needs to be loving and one is religious.\n(Mind is doubt -- and doubt is a drag was the gist of Osho's next address.) Doubts exploit you; they are parasites. They leave you utterly exhausted, tired, bored. They suck all juice out of you, they leave you just like a dry bone.\nThat's why so many people in the world look so serious, so sad. The world is not serious, the world is rejoicing. Look at the trees and the birds and the animals and the stars and the rivers. The whole existence is in a continuous celebration except for man, because only man can live in the heart and only man can live in the head. The choice is open. It is not open for anybody else; only man has the freedom to choose. And we have chosen the mind because mind helps in the world to have more money, to have more power, more prestige; it helps in fulfilling your so-called desires and ambitions. But it destroys you. It destroys all that is worth having: it destroys your very soul.\nThe heart has to be chosen. Once you choose the heart, loyalty, trust, love, start flowering. One wonders where all the doubts have suddenly gone. Just as you bring light into a room and the darkness disappears, the same happens with the heart. Once you start choosing the heart instead of the head, all doubts and all darkness disappears. Suddenly your life is full of light, full of love. And love is a rejoicing. Love is festive, it is playful. And I call this quality of love, of trust, godly, divine.\nThere is no way to prove god as far as mind is concerned. No argument can quench the infinitely doubting quality of the mind; there is no way. But the heart never doubts; the heart simply knows, it knows intuitively -- no proofs are required. God is self-evident for the heart, just as light is self-evident for the person who has eyes. Only the blind person thinks about light and only the blind person think's about god.\nThe heart has its own eyes, its own approach towards reality -- a direct, immediate connection with reality.\nBe in the heart, live through the heart. Enhance the qualities of the heart, nourish them. Even if you have much to lose in the world don't be worried, because if you gain in the inner world you are gaining something eternal. In the outside world everything is momentary. You may have money today you may not have money tomorrow. You may be powerful today, tomorrow you may not be powerful. You may be a president today, tomorrow you may be nobody.\nBefore the communist revolution in Russia the prime minister of Russia was a man called Kerensky.\nAfter the revolution everybody forgot about him; he escaped from Russia, and then nobody ever thought about what happened to him. Just a few years ago he died in New York -- he was a grocer! For all those fifty years he was living there, just running a small shop, and nobody was even aware that he was once one of the most powerful men in the world.\nEverything is momentary on the outside. And one thing is certain, that death will take everything away, and death is inevitable. But in the inner world whatsoever you gain is going to be with you; even death cannot destroy it. You will go on carrying it with you. The body will be consumed by death, the head will be consumed by death, but your love, your joy, your truth, will go with you. That is the real treasure.\n(My religion is bliss, Osho told Anand Dharma, and if it has any commandment it is to celebrate as many moments of your life as you possibly can.)\nDon't think that a few things are mundane and a few other things are sacred. For the man who knows how to rejoice everything is sacred. There is no division between the world and god -- it is all divine.\nPerhaps the world is manifest god and god is the unmanifest world. And when one rejoices, why make any difference between the manifest and the unmanifest? The flower is the manifest seed and the seed is the unmanifest flower -- they are one. So is this world and that, this shore and that. There is no need to divide materialism and spiritualism -- they are all together.\nSo rejoice in the smallest things: taking a shower or drinking tea. Don't make\nany difference. To the man who knows how to be blissful drinking tea is as sacred as any prayer can be, his sleep is as sacred as any religious activity.\nCheerfulness brings a new vision, a new perspective. It transforms the whole world. Then chopping 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nwood and carrying water from the well is as beautiful as the greatest creativity. And this is the magic of sannyas, to transform the ordinary into the extraordinary. The secret lies in this small word, \"bliss\".\nSo you have to enquire deeply into the world of bliss, and not only enquire but start living it, so that for twenty -- four hours round the clock whatsoever you are doing becomes religious. If you are sad you miss the point. So don't be sad and serious. Laughing, dancing singing live your life in a very simple and humble way, without any desire to improve, to attain something to be ambitious, because life is so beautiful in its ordinariness that any improvement is going to destroy that beauty.\n(The birds and the bees can teach us a few things, he went on to tell the next sannyasin.) Learn from the birds their song, learn from the trees their dance, learn from the rivers their music. And once you open up you will be surprised, the whole existence is such a poetic phenomenon!\nOne need not enquire into the meaning of it all; then it becomes a philosophical enquiry. The moment you ask, \"What is the meaning of this?\" you have lost track of poetry. The moment you start dancing with a tree without asking what is the meaning of this swaying tree in the wind?\" you are being poetic. And the miracle, the miracle of miracles, is that the person who starts thinking \"What is the meaning of it all?\" will never find the meaning, and the person who does not care about the meaning immediately finds it. Dance with the trees, sing with the birds, swim in the ocean, and you will find the meaning -- without seeking it.\nJust become part of this beautiful existence.\nSing your song, because everybody has come with a song in the heart and unless you sing it vou will remain unfulfilled. You have to do your thing -- that's what I mean by singing your song. Be creative, in whatsoever way it is. Whatsoever you feel like doing, do it! Don't be bothered about what others say; that is irrelevant. Insist that this is what you want to do and this is what you are going to do, irrespective of all the consequences. Don't compromise.\nThe poet is really a rebel, he never compromises. If he compromises he is not a poet, he is a businessman. And if you don't compromise your love will grow in leaps and bounds. Sing your song and you will find love coming, arriving from some hidden sources within you. It will fill you; overfill you! It will start overflowing you; it will start reaching others.\nThat's how I have reached millions of people. I never go anywhere. I simply go on sitting in my chair!\nBuddha at least travelled from one village to another for forty-two years. Mahavir travelled, Jesus travelled.\nI may be the first man who simply sits in his chair in his room, never even going outside! But my song is reaching people, without any effort it is reaching millions. You just have to be loving, and then you have such infinite energy that it is bound to affect the whole quality of existence.\nBut insist on one thing and that is, \"I have to be myself.\" I teach my sannyasins: be yourself. Never compromise, don't imitate -- sing your song. And you will find love and you will find bliss, and ultimately you will find truth and god.\n(The natural spring of wisdom can only flow when it is unimpeded by the rocks of knowledge, Osho explained.)\nEverybody brings wisdom with him, but we become overburdened with knowledge that others are very eager to impose upon us. Parents, teachers, the priests, the politicians... everybody is eager to impose his knowledge upon the child, and they destroy the wisdom of the child. The wisdom becomes so burdened with stupid knowledge -- with geography and with history which are sheer nonsense -- and with scriptures.\nThe Bible and the Koran and the Gita... if they are not your own experience they only burden you. They can burden you so much that you stop moving -- the\nburden can be mountainous. And as you grow in age, more and more knowledge goes on accumulating.\nMy effort here is to help you get rid of knowledge, because wisdom is your very nature. If you can get rid of knowledge you will be surprised: underneath all this rubbish there is a diamond which you have brought with you, which has not to be given to you. It is already there, it has to be brought out.\nThat's exactly the meaning of the word 'education': to draw out. But what the educationalists have been doing for centuries is just the opposite; it is miseducation, it is not education. They are not drawing out your nature, they are stuffing something in you from the outside, they are forcing you to swallow it. And of course they are very clever in forcing you. They punish you, they reward you, they manipulate you in every possible way. And the child is really innocent. He starts doing what he is told to do, and by the time he is capable of doing something on his own, he is so overburdened that he completely forgets that he had an insight of his own.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nWisdom means your own insight. It has not to be taught to you, it needs no tuition. That's why we call it intuition. It is inner, it is already a given fact; it is a gift from God.\nSo drop all knowledge and search within yourself for your intrinsic nature. And that's what wisdom is. It is very innocent. It gives you clarity, transparency; it makes you more and more aware about yourself, about others. It awakens you. It creates an inner light. And once you have that light clear, unburdened, unclouded, your life starts moving in the right direction. You need not force it to move in any direction, it starts moving of its own accord. You have found the key -- it is hidden in you.\nThe function of the master is not to teach you anything, not to help you to learn something, but just the opposite: to help you unlearn so that you can find your\nown source.\n(You can get to know god through prayer -- but that's a somewhat unsophisticated way to get acquainted, Osho told the last initiate, a man from Denmark.) Prayer is for immature persons, for childish persons, for retarded people, because prayer means hypothesising a god outside and talking to that god and shouting and telling him, \"I am miserable and you are great\" and praising him. The whole thing is childish because you have first projected a god\n-- that god is your creation. Hence the Hindu has his own projection, the Mohammedan has his own, the Christian has his own.\nThere are three hundred religions in the world and at least three thousand sects of those religions, so there are at least three thousand concepts about god. God is one -- how can there be three thousand concepts? They are our projections. First we create a god, an idea, a dream, and then we start talking to that dream. It is almost like auto-hypnosis: you are hypnotising yourself by your own words, and nobody answers. But one can befool oneself totally.\nIt is a very childish approach. That's why we call god the father because the child needs a father; or we call god the mother because the child needs a mother.\nGautam the Buddha says there is no god forget all about it. In fact he is saying prayer is not for the grown-up people it is not for mature people. For mature people meditation is the way. Meditation means no hypothesising about god on the outside. Meditation simply means becoming silent a centering becoming rooted in your very being.\nAnd in that rootedness for the first time you start finding a new quality. That new quality can be called godliness -- not god but godliness. Because it is something which vou have never known some new name has to be given to it -- call it truth, liberation, freedom. It is such a transcendental quality, that \"godliness\" is a perfectly beautiful word for it. But you won't find any god, not some ancient, old man sitting somewhere above the clouds. That is very childish.\nCarl Gustav Jung has written in his memoirs, \"Whenever I think of God sitting above the clouds I am reminded of my own childhood ideas\" -- because his father was a priest so he had been continuously sermonising about god in heaven. And the child was worried that if that god suddenly starts pissing then?...\nA child is a child! Or he defecates? So Carl Gustav Jung says \"I used to dream that he was pissing and the whole world was drowned in his piss! I would come out of my dreams so afraid and scared. \"What kind of god is this sitting there? Sooner or later he will piss! How long can he control it? Unless he is dead... then that is another thing.\nBut the whole idea is childish, stupid. There is no god sitting somewhere, but there is certainly godliness within you. That is found through meditation, not through prayer. And if you find your godliness through meditation, then a new understanding about prayer arises too. Then prayer is not praise of god, praise of the lord. Then prayer is just a thankfulness towards the whole existence for how much it has given to us. It is gratitude. Then prayer also has a different quality. You don't say anything you simply bow down to the earth, to existence, to the sun, to the moon, to the mountains not towards somebody in particular, not towards some person but just towards the whole. It is pure gratitude! Then prayer is also beautiful -- but that prayer is known only by those who have found godliness through meditation.\nOtherwise the people who have gathered in the churches and the temples and the mosques are all retarded people... retarded people go there. If you want to count how many retarded people are in the world you can simply go into the temples and churches and the mosques and just count and you will find the right people there!\nPsychologists say that the average mental age of humanity is twelve years. Certainly it is a retarded thing, this humanity is very retarded. A person may be eighty years old and his mental age is twelve. Of course his religions attitude cannot be more than that of a twelve-year old. His approach towards life will be 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- childish.\nI teach meditation, and then one day prayer is possible, but that is a totally different phenomenon. It has nothing to do with prayer as you have known it I\ninsist on meditation. Once the flower of meditation opens in you and you feel godliness, you experience godliness, then there is a natural gratitude. It is neither Christian nor Hindu nor Mohammedan nor Buddhist, it is simply gratitude towards the whole. That is prayer. It is the fragrance of meditation.\nJust the Tip of the Iceberg Chapter #18\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"3518","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/just_the_tip_of_the_iceberg/part17/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/just_the_tip_of_the_iceberg/>Just The Tip Of The Iceberg</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>17 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;3518 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Just_The_Tip_Of_The_Iceberg/part17.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part16>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

disappear as if it exists not. The deeper you go, the more illusory the
world becomes, as if you had seen it in a dream and it is no more. You
are so alone that nobody else exists. But this is a basic requirement to
be fulfilled.</p><p>Courage is the foundation of all religious growth, of all spiritual
growth. And if one is courageous enough, then of course one can have
infinite bliss, one can</p><p>have absolute freedom, one can have divine life.</p><p>That is resurrection: dying to the old pattern, the old gestalt, the
old you, and beginning anew. It is a rebirth.</p><p>Sannyas is the whole process of rebirthing.</p><p>(The pointer in Prem Wolfgang's name was that love takes guts!)</p><p>... because you can love only if you are ready to drop the ego -- and
that is the hardest thing in life to do, the most difficult thing;. One
can renounce money, family, power, prestige, everything, but when it
comes to renouncing; the ego it becomes almost impossible -- -not
impossible, but almost impossible. One can renounce money because the
ego can en joy it: "Look how much I have renounced!" You can renounce
the family, the society; you can go to the mountains or to a monastery,
and the ego will be going with you, rejoicing that "I am not an ordinary
person -- am a holy man!"</p><p>But when it comes to renouncing the ego, the ego resists. It gives
you a tough fight, a tough time. You push it out from one side, it comes
back in from another side. You throw it out from the front door, it
comes in from the' back door. You try to be humble, it enters your
humility; it starts bragging about humility. It says, "Look! There is
nobody more humble than me!" Its names are very subtle.</p><p>One needs courage because it is almost like dying. It is a death in a
way, because we have lived with the ego, we have become so identified
with it -- there is not even an inch's difference. It is not like taking
your clothes off, it is like peeling your skin -- it hurts. Hence
courage is needed, clarity is needed, understanding is needed, awareness
is needed, and tremendous love is needed, trust is needed. Unless you
know what love is you will not be able to drop the ego.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>So many so-called saints have failed for the simple reason that they
tried to drop</p><p>the ego but they never tried simultaneously to grow towards love.
Then where will your energy go? If you drop the ego, great energy is
released, and if you are against love then that energy will go on again
creating a new ego.</p><p>So these are two parts of the same process: drop the ego and put your
total energy into love so that nothing is left for the ego to survive
on, so there is no nourishment left and it dies of starvation. As the
ego dies your love explodes. And to know love is to know god. To love is
the only religion. One need not be a Christian or a Hindu or a
Mohammedan, one only needs to be loving and one is religious.</p><p>(Mind is doubt -- and doubt is a drag was the gist of Osho's next
address.) Doubts exploit you; they are parasites. They leave you utterly
exhausted, tired, bored. They suck all juice out of you, they leave you
just like a dry bone.</p><p>That's why so many people in the world look so serious, so sad. The
world is not serious, the world is rejoicing. Look at the trees and the
birds and the animals and the stars and the rivers. The whole existence
is in a continuous celebration except for man, because only man can live
in the heart and only man can live in the head. The choice is open. It
is not open for anybody else; only man has the freedom to choose. And we
have chosen the mind because mind helps in the world to have more money,
to have more power, more prestige; it helps in fulfilling your so-called
desires and ambitions. But it destroys you. It destroys all that is
worth having: it destroys your very soul.</p><p>The heart has to be chosen. Once you choose the heart, loyalty,
trust, love, start flowering. One wonders where all the doubts have
suddenly gone. Just as you bring light into a room and the darkness
disappears, the same happens with the heart. Once you start choosing the
heart instead of the head, all doubts and all darkness disappears.
Suddenly your life is full of light, full of love. And love is a
rejoicing. Love is festive, it is playful. And I call this quality of
love, of trust, godly, divine.</p><p>There is no way to prove god as far as mind is concerned. No argument
can quench the infinitely doubting quality of the mind; there is no way.
But the heart never doubts; the heart simply knows, it knows intuitively
-- no proofs are required. God is self-evident for the heart, just as
light is self-evident for the person who has eyes. Only the blind person
thinks about light and only the blind person think's about god.</p><p>The heart has its own eyes, its own approach towards reality -- a
direct, immediate connection with reality.</p><p>Be in the heart, live through the heart. Enhance the qualities of the
heart, nourish them. Even if you have much to lose in the world don't be
worried, because if you gain in the inner world you are gaining
something eternal. In the outside world everything is momentary. You may
have money today you may not have money tomorrow. You may be powerful
today, tomorrow you may not be powerful. You may be a president today,
tomorrow you may be nobody.</p><p>Before the communist revolution in Russia the prime minister of
Russia was a man called Kerensky.</p><p>After the revolution everybody forgot about him; he escaped from
Russia, and then nobody ever thought about what happened to him. Just a
few years ago he died in New York -- he was a grocer! For all those
fifty years he was living there, just running a small shop, and nobody
was even aware that he was once one of the most powerful men in the
world.</p><p>Everything is momentary on the outside. And one thing is certain,
that death will take everything away, and death is inevitable. But in
the inner world whatsoever you gain is going to be with you; even death
cannot destroy it. You will go on carrying it with you. The body will be
consumed by death, the head will be consumed by death, but your love,
your joy, your truth, will go with you. That is the real treasure.</p><p>(My religion is bliss, Osho told Anand Dharma, and if it has any
commandment it is to celebrate as many moments of your life as you
possibly can.)</p><p>Don't think that a few things are mundane and a few other things are
sacred. For the man who knows how to rejoice everything is sacred. There
is no division between the world and god -- it is all divine.</p><p>Perhaps the world is manifest god and god is the unmanifest world.
And when one rejoices, why make any difference between the manifest and
the unmanifest? The flower is the manifest seed and the seed is the
unmanifest flower -- they are one. So is this world and that, this shore
and that. There is no need to divide materialism and spiritualism --
they are all together.</p><p>So rejoice in the smallest things: taking a shower or drinking tea.
Don't make</p><p>any difference. To the man who knows how to be blissful drinking tea
is as sacred as any prayer can be, his sleep is as sacred as any
religious activity.</p><p>Cheerfulness brings a new vision, a new perspective. It transforms
the whole world. Then chopping 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on

creativity. And this is the magic of sannyas, to transform the ordinary
into the extraordinary. The secret lies in this small word, "bliss".</p><p>So you have to enquire deeply into the world of bliss, and not only
enquire but start living it, so that for twenty -- four hours round the
clock whatsoever you are doing becomes religious. If you are sad you
miss the point. So don't be sad and serious. Laughing, dancing singing
live your life in a very simple and humble way, without any desire to
improve, to attain something to be ambitious, because life is so
beautiful in its ordinariness that any improvement is going to destroy
that beauty.</p><p>(The birds and the bees can teach us a few things, he went on to tell
the next sannyasin.) Learn from the birds their song, learn from the
trees their dance, learn from the rivers their music. And once you open
up you will be surprised, the whole existence is such a poetic
phenomenon!</p><p>One need not enquire into the meaning of it all; then it becomes a
philosophical enquiry. The moment you ask, "What is the meaning of
this?" you have lost track of poetry. The moment you start dancing with
a tree without asking what is the meaning of this swaying tree in the
wind?" you are being poetic. And the miracle, the miracle of miracles,
is that the person who starts thinking "What is the meaning of it all?"
will never find the meaning, and the person who does not care about the
meaning immediately finds it. Dance with the trees, sing with the birds,
swim in the ocean, and you will find the meaning -- without seeking
it.</p><p>Just become part of this beautiful existence.</p><p>Sing your song, because everybody has come with a song in the heart
and unless you sing it vou will remain unfulfilled. You have to do your
thing -- that's what I mean by singing your song. Be creative, in
whatsoever way it is. Whatsoever you feel like doing, do it! Don't be
bothered about what others say; that is irrelevant. Insist that this is
what you want to do and this is what you are going to do, irrespective
of all the consequences. Don't compromise.</p><p>The poet is really a rebel, he never compromises. If he compromises
he is not a poet, he is a businessman. And if you don't compromise your
love will grow in leaps and bounds. Sing your song and you will find
love coming, arriving from some hidden sources within you. It will fill
you; overfill you! It will start overflowing you; it will start reaching
others.</p><p>That's how I have reached millions of people. I never go anywhere. I
simply go on sitting in my chair!</p><p>Buddha at least travelled from one village to another for forty-two
years. Mahavir travelled, Jesus travelled.</p><p>I may be the first man who simply sits in his chair in his room,
never even going outside! But my song is reaching people, without any
effort it is reaching millions. You just have to be loving, and then you
have such infinite energy that it is bound to affect the whole quality
of existence.</p><p>But insist on one thing and that is, "I have to be myself." I teach
my sannyasins: be yourself. Never compromise, don't imitate -- sing your
song. And you will find love and you will find bliss, and ultimately you
will find truth and god.</p><p>(The natural spring of wisdom can only flow when it is unimpeded by
the rocks of knowledge, Osho explained.)</p><p>Everybody brings wisdom with him, but we become overburdened with
knowledge that others are very eager to impose upon us. Parents,
teachers, the priests, the politicians... everybody is eager to impose
his knowledge upon the child, and they destroy the wisdom of the child.
The wisdom becomes so burdened with stupid knowledge -- with geography
and with history which are sheer nonsense -- and with scriptures.</p><p>The Bible and the Koran and the Gita... if they are not your own
experience they only burden you. They can burden you so much that you
stop moving -- the</p><p>burden can be mountainous. And as you grow in age, more and more
knowledge goes on accumulating.</p><p>My effort here is to help you get rid of knowledge, because wisdom is
your very nature. If you can get rid of knowledge you will be surprised:
underneath all this rubbish there is a diamond which you have brought
with you, which has not to be given to you. It is already there, it has
to be brought out.</p><p>That's exactly the meaning of the word 'education': to draw out. But
what the educationalists have been doing for centuries is just the
opposite; it is miseducation, it is not education. They are not drawing
out your nature, they are stuffing something in you from the outside,
they are forcing you to swallow it. And of course they are very clever
in forcing you. They punish you, they reward you, they manipulate you in
every possible way. And the child is really innocent. He starts doing
what he is told to do, and by the time he is capable of doing something
on his own, he is so overburdened that he completely forgets that he had
an insight of his own.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>Wisdom means your own insight. It has not to be taught to you, it
needs no tuition. That's why we call it intuition. It is inner, it is
already a given fact; it is a gift from God.</p><p>So drop all knowledge and search within yourself for your intrinsic
nature. And that's what wisdom is. It is very innocent. It gives you
clarity, transparency; it makes you more and more aware about yourself,
about others. It awakens you. It creates an inner light. And once you
have that light clear, unburdened, unclouded, your life starts moving in
the right direction. You need not force it to move in any direction, it
starts moving of its own accord. You have found the key -- it is hidden
in you.</p><p>The function of the master is not to teach you anything, not to help
you to learn something, but just the opposite: to help you unlearn so
that you can find your</p><p>own source.</p><p>(You can get to know god through prayer -- but that's a somewhat
unsophisticated way to get acquainted, Osho told the last initiate, a
man from Denmark.) Prayer is for immature persons, for childish persons,
for retarded people, because prayer means hypothesising a god outside
and talking to that god and shouting and telling him, "I am miserable
and you are great" and praising him. The whole thing is childish because
you have first projected a god</p><p>-- that god is your creation. Hence the Hindu has his own projection,
the Mohammedan has his own, the Christian has his own.</p><p>There are three hundred religions in the world and at least three
thousand sects of those religions, so there are at least three thousand
concepts about god. God is one -- how can there be three thousand
concepts? They are our projections. First we create a god, an idea, a
dream, and then we start talking to that dream. It is almost like
auto-hypnosis: you are hypnotising yourself by your own words, and
nobody answers. But one can befool oneself totally.</p><p>It is a very childish approach. That's why we call god the father
because the child needs a father; or we call god the mother because the
child needs a mother.</p><p>Gautam the Buddha says there is no god forget all about it. In fact
he is saying prayer is not for the grown-up people it is not for mature
people. For mature people meditation is the way. Meditation means no
hypothesising about god on the outside. Meditation simply means becoming
silent a centering becoming rooted in your very being.</p><p>And in that rootedness for the first time you start finding a new
quality. That new quality can be called godliness -- not god but
godliness. Because it is something which vou have never known some new
name has to be given to it -- call it truth, liberation, freedom. It is
such a transcendental quality, that "godliness" is a perfectly beautiful
word for it. But you won't find any god, not some ancient, old man
sitting somewhere above the clouds. That is very childish.</p><p>Carl Gustav Jung has written in his memoirs, "Whenever I think of God
sitting above the clouds I am reminded of my own childhood ideas" --
because his father was a priest so he had been continuously sermonising
about god in heaven. And the child was worried that if that god suddenly
starts pissing then?...</p><p>A child is a child! Or he defecates? So Carl Gustav Jung says "I used
to dream that he was pissing and the whole world was drowned in his
piss! I would come out of my dreams so afraid and scared. "What kind of
god is this sitting there? Sooner or later he <em>will</em> piss! How
long can he control it? Unless he is dead... then that is another
thing.</p><p>But the whole idea is childish, stupid. There is no god sitting
somewhere, but there is certainly godliness within you. That is found
through meditation, not through prayer. And if you find your godliness
through meditation, then a new understanding about prayer arises too.
Then prayer is not praise of god, praise of the lord. Then prayer is
just a thankfulness towards the whole existence for how much it has
given to us. It is gratitude. Then prayer also has a different quality.
You don't say anything you simply bow down to the earth, to existence,
to the sun, to the moon, to the mountains not towards somebody in
particular, not towards some person but just towards the whole. It is
pure gratitude! Then prayer is also beautiful -- but that prayer is
known only by those who have found godliness through meditation.</p><p>Otherwise the people who have gathered in the churches and the
temples and the mosques are all retarded people... retarded people go
there. If you want to count how many retarded people are in the world
you can simply go into the temples and churches and the mosques and just
count and you will find the right people there!</p><p>Psychologists say that the average mental age of humanity is twelve
years. Certainly it is a retarded thing, this humanity is very retarded.
A person may be eighty years old and his mental age is twelve. Of course
his religions attitude cannot be more than that of a twelve-year old.

gratitude. It is neither Christian nor Hindu nor Mohammedan nor

It is for reference purposes only.]\nMeditation is the alchemy of dispelling all darkness. If one enters within without knowing meditation one will find only darkness. That's why people cannot believe Socrates, Jesus, Buddha -- because people's experience goes against the experience of all the awakened ones. Whenever they look within there is darkness, and all these people who have meditated deeply say, \"All is light -- just go in.\"\nThis has been one of the basic problems for all seekers: if you go in without meditation you will find darkness. It is only through meditation that darkness is transformed into light; hence, before entering in one has to learn the whole art of how to be meditative, how to be silent, without thoughts, how just to be. That's what meditation is all about -- how just to be. Once you know that point where thinking disappears and everything comes to a full stop, then turn in and look and you are in for a great surprise: there is all light, infinite light.\nThat is the moment one comes to know that this is our source, and that we don't belong to the world of darkness, we belong to the world of light, that we belong to the world of stars, to the world that is beyond.\nThat we are not bodies and not minds, that we are divine. Birth is not birth, death\nis not death. We have been before, we will be afterwards; we are eternal.\nAll these experiences immediately become actual when the light is there. In darkness you cannot see yourself; only in the light can you see who you are, what your real constituents are, and what immensity, what treasure, is hidden within you. Every man, every being, is a child of light because we all come from the same source. We are rays of the same sun and we go back to the same source.\nSociety starts perverting the child, society starts distracting him from his nature. society starts creating barriers for him so his blissfulness becomes blocked. Society goes on putting rocks around him because it is very much afraid of blissful people. Blissful people are the most dangerous people in the world -- they are pure fire. And society wants robots, machines.\nIt is not just an accident that science is continuously improving machines and substituting man with machines. Man is continuously becoming useless because machines can function more efficiently, and if man has to compete with machines he has to forget all blissfulness, all intelligence, all love, all that makes him a man. He has to forget about it, only then can he compete with machines; he has to function like a robot. And that's what our schools, colleges and universities are for, to destroy your humanity and to create an efficient mechanism.\nThat's why great effort is needed to be that which you already are because you have to remove all the rocks put in the way by the society. And they are heavy rocks; if one is not industrious one cannot succeed in knowing bliss. And to fail in knowing bliss is to miss the whole opportunity of life. Then one exists in 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nvain, there is no point.\nSo let this become the beginning of a great journey. You will have to put all your energy into it. Once you decide to put all your energy into it, it is not difficult. Those rocks can be destroyed because they are unnatural and your nature is just\nhidden beneath them. If you start removing rocks, springs of joy start flowing, you will have a second childhood -- and that is the beginning of true religiousness, the second childhood.\nSo you have undone all that the society has done to you, you are free from all that bondage, you are a man again. You are again on the right track you are again moving naturally, spontaneously, alert, watchful.\nYou are no more mechanical, now you are awareness. And with awareness all the doors of all the mysteries open. You become a welcome guest into the house of god.\n[As the photographer from Switzerland sat back to listen to Osho's address he removed his glasses and placed them on the floor beside him. Nothing goes unobserved... ) Man lives in lies. He believes they are the only truth. And once you believe in a certain lie you make it a truth. But it is an invented truth, and it cannot liberate you and it cannot help you to know god -- because truth is another name for god.\nPeople are Christians, Hindus, Mohammedans -- these are all borrowed ideas, and truth cannot be borrowed. The only thing in life which cannot be borrowed is truth. It is so delicate, it is so subtle, that the moment it is given from one person to another it dies in the communication. It never reaches the other, what reaches us a lie.\nTruth is an experience, The man who has known can speak about it, and the man who has not known can remember those words but those words will be empty words for the man who has not known. How can they be full of meaning? -- meaning comes from experience. So for people, \"good\", \"love\", \"truth\",\n\"freedom\" are all beautiful words; they use them and they believe that they know what they are saying.\nThey know nothing. Only very few people have known; millions only believe and believing is not knowing.\nKnowing is totally different from believing.\nIn fact, the first step towards knowing is dropping of all beliefs. Unless you become unconditioned you cannot know what actually is, because your belief\nwill cover your eyes, it will colour everything.\nThe Christian looks in a Christian way and the Hindu in a Hindu way. And the truth is neither Christian nor Hindu, the truth is simply truth, Both have coloured glasses.\nJust as you have nut down your glasses, in exactly the same way all beliefs have to be put down. Then you face the truth as it is. And to know truth is to know god, there is no other god.\n(The master only gives you hints about how to be blissful -- not because he wants to keep you guessing but because it's a delicate business, the job of directing disciples, Osho confided.) The master cannot give you a detailed map of the territory because no map exists. And no map can ever be made for the simple reason that every individual is so unique that if a map is prepared then the map will be applicable only to the person who made it. If Buddha makes a map it is true as far as he is concerned, if I make a map it is true as far as I am concerned. But the trouble arises when people start imitating and going according to the map.\nMy map will become a distraction for you from yourself -- you will start imitating. So seeing the uniqueness of every individual, the real master never gives a map. The real master always respects the uniqueness, the individuality, of every individual. Hence we can only give you a few hints. You have to understand those hints and go on the journey without any map.\nThat's why only very few courageous people ever try to enter the territory of bliss, of truth, of love --\nbecause you have to go without any map. And the mind is very much afraid to go into something unknown, to go beyond the boundary to take the jump into the unknown.\nAnd whatsoever I am saying here can only be taken as hints. They are helpful, but one is not to cling to them because you are not made for the clothes, clothes are made for you. You are not made for principles, principles are made for you. But Christianity has a detailed map; it tries to cut every person to the size and shape of Jesus.\nNow, if you are a little taller than Jesus you will be in trouble; Christianity will\ncut you down, either from the feet or from the head. If you are a little fatter than Jesus you are in trouble; you will have to go on a diet, a fast. And nobody is exactly like Jesus. Hence nobody needs to be a Christian or a Hindu or a 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nMohammedan, everybody needs to be just himself.\nMy sannyasins are not my followers but just my lovers, my friends. I am not here to give you detailed guidance, but just a few hints here and there, a few touches here and there. And then I leave you alone to make your own map, to cut your clothes according to your size and shape and to move into that unknown territory within yourself which is never repeated. It is yours and only yours.\nSo remember: the greatest calamity that can happen to a person is that he starts imitating somebody.\nRespect Jesus and Buddha and Krishna and Lao Tzu and Zarathustra -- and there have been many other people of tremendous insight. Respect them, listen to their music, try to understand their hints, but never be an imitator, never be a follower. Just be yourself.\n(Then Osho talked about another aspect of how we loss track of our real nature -\n- by trying to impose character on ourselves instead of allowing our consciousness to flower.) If one follows the first route, creating a character, one goes pseudo, one becomes false, and split also.\nOne becomes two persons because the very method of creating a character is that of repression -- there is no other method. You have to repress your nature and you have to act according to certain principles decided by others. They tell you that is right and that is wrong, what is good and what is bad. They have already given you ten commandments and you have to follow them, Now what will you do with your nature?\nThe only thing possible is that you repress your nature you neglect it, ignore it. But nature cannot be changed in this way; it goes on nagging you from within\nand It goes on forcing you to go against the character that you have cultivated; hence all the hypocrisy. It is very rare to find a religious person who is not a hypocrite. And a person is really religious only when be is not a hypocrite.\nHypocrisy means you pretend to be something which you are not. You know it, it hurts, hence it creates sadness. The whole world is full of sadness because the whole world has been directed to create character, morality.\nMy effort here is just the opposite. I am not interested in character at all, in morality st all. I sm not telling people to be immoral, I am telling people to be conscious, to create consciousness.\nAnd that is what meditation is meant for. It is a method to create consciousness. It makes you more alert, more aware, and as you become more aware your life starts changing. But now you are not trying to change; it changes because of your awareness. Now you can see more clearly; your clarity makes you go towards the right. Not that you have to go towards the right according to Moses or Manu or somebody else; you simply have to be clear and your clarity determines everything. It becomes the only source of decision, Now decisions are not coming from the outside, you are living your own insight. Your life will not be divided, vou will not be a hypocrite. You will be one thing and you will do the same thing, Your doing and your being will have a deep harmony, and when doing and being are harmonious life is a joy, it is a dance.\nGood has to come out of consciousness, not out of cultivation or character. Real morality is born out of ccnsciousness. So that has to be the focus, everything else is non-essential. The essential thing is awareness.\n(Osho spoke next to Prem Puneet, a town-planner who hailed from Holland.) Love brings a purity, not vice versa. It has been said again and again by the priests in the past that if you are pure then your life will have the fragrance of love. That is wrong. If one waits for it, it is never going to happen, because how will you be pure?\nLove is nothing but a process of purification. When you love you become aware of jealousy; if you don't love you will never even become aware of jealousy. That's why the so-called saints decide not to love --\nbecause that keeps their jealousy fast asleep. It is there, dormant, and because it is dormant they are not aware of it and nobody else is aware of it. But one is not\nfree of it. It is there, like a seed waiting for its time, and any moment it can sprout; any situation and it can start growing. The potential is there, Love makes you aware of jealousy, of possessiveness, of domination, of ego and a thousand other trips, One can simply drop love and all those things will disappear, but only from your consciousness. They will become part of your unconscious, they will go underground. But you are not free of them.\nThe saints have been very much afraid of love for the simple reason that it makes you aware of things which you don't want to be aware of,\nMy effort here is to help you to be more loving because love brings all kinds of things to the surface. It is a revelation. Of course there is great pain in it because to know that you are jealous is to know that you are ugly; to know that you are possessive is to know that you are not what you should be; to know that you are always trying in some way or other to dominate is not a good feeling, It hurts to see all this madness in 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- oneself.\nThe saints, the so-called saints, have chosen a cheap way: just drop love and all things will disappear from your vision.\nMy effort is for you to go deeper into love so you can bring all these things totally to the surface, so that you can even know their very roots -- not only the leaves and the branches but the roots. And the day you come to know their roots you can throw them out.\nLove is a process of purification, but a painful process. All growth is painful, hence people have decided not to grow, it is too painful. But then you miss the whole opportunity. Then one remains retarded --\npsychologically, spiritually, very retarded. You can see the whole humanity living in a retarded way.\nNobody is really grown-up because people have avoided the pain that is inevitable in growth.\nSo one has to accept the pain very understandingly. No need to make a fuss about it, no need to magnify it; one just has to accept it, the way you accept surgery, the way you accept an operation. You know that there is going to be a little pain but that has to be accepted. You understandingly accept it.\nIf one can accept the pain then one can soon go beyond it. The deeper your acceptance of it, the quicker you go beyond it. A man of real intelligence can even go beyond it in a single moment. But in that single moment he will have to suffer hell because the whole of the pain will explode with such intensity that you will feel you are in hell. But if you can accept it, not in a reluctant way, not in any resistant way, if you allow it because it is natural, it has to be so; nothing can be done about it; if you can accept it in a relaxed way you will go beyond it, you will transcend it. And then you are purified, purified of all poisons. Use love as a process of purification.\nLove is the beginning and love is the end, or course in the middle there is pain, but it is worth it. Once you have come to purification you will know what you have attained is millions of times more valuable than all the pain that you have gone through, That pain seems so tiny. But it is later on only. When you are passing through the pain it looks very big because you have nothing else to compare it with.\nWhen the explosion of bliss happens then you know that the pain was nothing, it was just a nightmare.\nBut passing through a nightmare, although it is only a dream, is painful. When you wake up you know, you laugh at it -- but that happens only later on.\nThe first thing that Bodhidharma did when he became enlightened was to laugh. It is said that tor seven days he was laughing and laughing. His friends, other meditators, started enquiring, \"Have you gone mad or something?\" He said, \"I was mad, now I am sane. And I am laughing because it looked so big. But I was making a mountain out of a molehill; it was nothing, Now that I have gained is so much that that price was almost nothing. Just for a song I have attained the ultimate.\"\nHence the presence of a Master is helpful, In those moments of pain and anguish\nand anxiety you can always look up to him, you can always see that there is a future because he represents your future. He is what you will be one day. In seeing him trust arises, in loving him one passes through the pain more comfortably, more easily.\nYes, if the trust is total one can pass through the pain almost painlessly. So it all depends on how much trust is there, how much surrender is there Sannyas is surrender, sannyas is trust, sannyas is a deep let-go!\n(An apt name for a child psychologist, Anand Daya means bliss and compassion, Osho explained to the Dutch woman before him.)\nAnand Daya means bliss and compassion.\nBliss happens inside, compassion is its outer expression. Bliss happens at your very center and compassion is its circumference. A man of bliss is inevitably a man of deep compassion and love.\nIf there is no compassion that means bliss has not happened, that that man is dreaming about it, he is hallucinating, he is in an illusion. Compassion is the proof that something real has happened.\nBecause of this fact, that compassion proves that bliss has happened, many people have tried to be compassionate. So they have tried the other way round because that seems easier. You can be very compassionate towards the poor and the sick and the old and the miserable. That's what all the Christian missionaries are doing. They are trying to be compassionate, but their compassion is superficial, very superficial and shallow. Bliss has not happened.\nRemember, if bliss happens compassion is bound to follow. You can create a compassionate character around yourself but bliss is not bound to follow because the center transforms the circumference, not vice versa. The circumference cannot transform the center.\nThe roots change the leaves but the leaves cannot change the roots. If the roots are healthy the leaves are 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nhealthy, but you cannot make the leaves healthy. You can paint them, you can make them as green as you want, you can paint them, but those leaves are dying. Your paint will kill them sooner than they would have died on their own. It will quicken their death, it will speed up their death; they will become dead sooner.\nAnd that's what has happened to your saints; they are trying to paint the leaves, they are trying to paint the flowers.\nIt is not only with ordinary people, not only with women; the saints are the same. Women are trying to paint their cheeks red and their lips with lipstick and everything. I don't know who they are befooling!\nLipstick looks so ugly that only a stupid woman can do it. But stupidity is very prevalent. Now they are trying to deceive people that they have such healthy lips. If your lips are healthy it is perfectly good, but by painting them you are really destroying them. You are not allowing them the sun and the air because they are covered by some ugly paint.\nBut the same is the case with your so-called saints -- it is the same humanity and the same logic. They are painted people, their compassion is just something painted.\nMy sannyasins have to remember it. I don't teach compassion because it has deceived many people. I teach bliss. Forget all about others, the first thing has to happen within you. And the moment it happens you will be able to share with others. That is going to happen naturally; there is no need to worry about it. It is an absolute inevitability, it is a by-product!\n(Then Osho wound up the evening by talking about the beauty meditation creates in and around the meditator.)\nMeditation does two things to you: one: it makes you aware of the beauty that exists all around, it makes you sensitive to it; and the second thing: it makes you beautiful, it gives you a certain grace. Your eyes become full of beauty because the whole existence is beautiful. We just have to drink out of it, we just have to allow the beauty to enter us. Through our eyes, through our ears, through all our senses; the beauty has to be allowed to enter us. It gives tremendous nourishment to the soul.\nOrdinarily a person is not aware of the beauty that surrounds existence. He is more aware of all that is ugly because the mind always goes on finding the negative. It counts the thorns, it misses the roses. It counts the wounds, it misses the blessings. That's the way of the mind.\nMind basically is negative, its whole approach is negative. It thinks only of dark things. From the past it goes on collecting dark things and about the future it goes on projecting dark things. It lives surrounded by a dark world of its own creation. And of course then life seems to be a great hell, The moment you move into meditation, the moment you become a little more silent, a little more calm and quiet, more relaxed, more resting in your being, you suddenly become aware of the beauty of the trees, of the beauty of the clouds, the beauty of people, of everything that is there.\nEverything is beautiful because it is all full of god; even rocks are overflowing with godliness. Nothing is empty Or god. And once you start experiencing all these beautiful dimensions the ultimate result is that you are so nourished by your beautiful experiences -- by music, by poetry, by dance, by celebration, by love that you become beautiful. A natural outcome is that a great grace arises in your being. It starts radiating.\nEverybody can see it, unless one is determined not to; that is another matter. If one wants to see it, it is there. That's why we have surrounded all the pictures of Jesus and Buddha and Zarathustra with light: a grace surrounds them.

Chuang Tzu Auditorium</h3><p>Archive code: 8009055 ShortTitle: ICEBRG05 Audio:</p><p>No Video:</p><p>No</p><p>[NOTE: This is an unedited tape transcript of an unpublished darshan
diary, which has been scanned and cleaned up. It is for reference
purposes only.]</p><p>Meditation is the alchemy of dispelling all darkness. If one enters
within without knowing meditation one will find only darkness. That's
why people cannot believe Socrates, Jesus, Buddha -- because people's
experience goes against the experience of all the awakened ones.
Whenever they look within there is darkness, and all these people who
have meditated deeply say, "All is light -- just go in."</p><p>This has been one of the basic problems for all seekers: if you go in
without meditation you will find darkness. It is only through meditation
that darkness is transformed into light; hence, before entering in one
has to learn the whole art of how to be meditative, how to be silent,
without thoughts, how just to be. That's what meditation is all about --
how just to be. Once you know that point where thinking disappears and
everything comes to a full stop, then turn in and look and you are in
for a great surprise: there is all light, infinite light.</p><p>That is the moment one comes to know that this is our source, and
that we don't belong to the world of darkness, we belong to the world of
light, that we belong to the world of stars, to the world that is
beyond.</p><p>That we are not bodies and not minds, that we are divine. Birth is
not birth, death</p><p>is not death. We have been before, we will be afterwards; we are
eternal.</p><p>All these experiences immediately become actual when the light is
there. In darkness you cannot see yourself; only in the light can you
see who you are, what your real constituents are, and what immensity,
what treasure, is hidden within you. Every man, every being, is a child
of light because we all come from the same source. We are rays of the
same sun and we go back to the same source.</p><p>Society starts perverting the child, society starts distracting him
from his nature. society starts creating barriers for him so his
blissfulness becomes blocked. Society goes on putting rocks around him
because it is very much afraid of blissful people. Blissful people are
the most dangerous people in the world -- they are pure fire. And
society wants robots, machines.</p><p>It is not just an accident that science is continuously improving
machines and substituting man with machines. Man is continuously
becoming useless because machines can function more efficiently, and if
man has to compete with machines he has to forget all blissfulness, all
intelligence, all love, all that makes him a man. He has to forget about
it, only then can he compete with machines; he has to function like a
robot. And that's what our schools, colleges and universities are for,
to destroy your humanity and to create an efficient mechanism.</p><p>That's why great effort is needed to be that which you already are
because you have to remove all the rocks put in the way by the society.
And they are heavy rocks; if one is not industrious one cannot succeed
in knowing bliss. And to fail in knowing bliss is to miss the whole
opportunity of life. Then one exists in 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished>Osho's books on

put all your energy into it. Once you decide to put all your energy into
it, it is not difficult. Those rocks can be destroyed because they are
unnatural and your nature is just</p><p>hidden beneath them. If you start removing rocks, springs of joy
start flowing, you will have a second childhood -- and that is the
beginning of true religiousness, the second childhood.</p><p>So you have undone all that the society has done to you, you are free
from all that bondage, you are a man again. You are again on the right
track you are again moving naturally, spontaneously, alert,
watchful.</p><p>You are no more mechanical, now you are awareness. And with awareness
all the doors of all the mysteries open. You become a welcome guest into
the house of god.</p><p>[As the photographer from Switzerland sat back to listen to Osho's
address he removed his glasses and placed them on the floor beside him.
Nothing goes unobserved... ) Man lives in lies. He believes they are the
only truth. And once you believe in a certain lie you make it a truth.
But it is an invented truth, and it cannot liberate you and it cannot
help you to know god -- because truth is another name for god.</p><p>People are Christians, Hindus, Mohammedans -- these are all borrowed
ideas, and truth cannot be borrowed. The only thing in life which cannot
be borrowed is truth. It is so delicate, it is so subtle, that the
moment it is given from one person to another it dies in the
communication. It never reaches the other, what reaches us a lie.</p><p>Truth is an experience, The man who has known can speak about it, and
the man who has not known can remember those words but those words will
be empty words for the man who has not known. How can they be full of
meaning? -- meaning comes from experience. So for people, "good",
"love", "truth",</p><p>"freedom" are all beautiful words; they use them and they believe
that they know what they are saying.</p><p>They know nothing. Only very few people have known; millions only
believe and believing is not knowing.</p><p>Knowing is totally different from believing.</p><p>In fact, the first step towards knowing is dropping of all beliefs.
Unless you become unconditioned you cannot know what actually is,
because your belief</p><p>will cover your eyes, it will colour everything.</p><p>The Christian looks in a Christian way and the Hindu in a Hindu way.
And the truth is neither Christian nor Hindu, the truth is simply truth,
Both have coloured glasses.</p><p>Just as you have nut down your glasses, in exactly the same way all
beliefs have to be put down. Then you face the truth as it is. And to
know truth is to know god, there is no other god.</p><p>(The master only gives you hints about how to be blissful -- not
because he wants to keep you guessing but because it's a delicate
business, the job of directing disciples, Osho confided.) The master
cannot give you a detailed map of the territory because no map exists.
And no map can ever be made for the simple reason that every individual
is so unique that if a map is prepared then the map will be applicable
only to the person who made it. If Buddha makes a map it is true as far
as he is concerned, if I make a map it is true as far as I am concerned.
But the trouble arises when people start imitating and going according
to the map.</p><p>My map will become a distraction for you from yourself -- you will
start imitating. So seeing the uniqueness of every individual, the real
master never gives a map. The real master always respects the
uniqueness, the individuality, of every individual. Hence we can only
give you a few hints. You have to understand those hints and go on the
journey without any map.</p><p>That's why only very few courageous people ever try to enter the
territory of bliss, of truth, of love --</p><p>because you have to go without any map. And the mind is very much
afraid to go into something unknown, to go beyond the boundary to take
the jump into the unknown.</p><p>And whatsoever I am saying here can only be taken as hints. They are
helpful, but one is not to cling to them because you are not made for
the clothes, clothes are made for you. You are not made for principles,
principles are made for you. But Christianity has a detailed map; it
tries to cut every person to the size and shape of Jesus.</p><p>Now, if you are a little taller than Jesus you will be in trouble;
Christianity will</p><p>cut you down, either from the feet or from the head. If you are a
little fatter than Jesus you are in trouble; you will have to go on a
diet, a fast. And nobody is exactly like Jesus. Hence nobody needs to be
a Christian or a Hindu or a 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>Mohammedan, everybody needs to be just himself.</p><p>My sannyasins are not my followers but just my lovers, my friends. I
am not here to give you detailed guidance, but just a few hints here and
there, a few touches here and there. And then I leave you alone to make
your own map, to cut your clothes according to your size and shape and
to move into that unknown territory within yourself which is never
repeated. It is yours and only yours.</p><p>So remember: the greatest calamity that can happen to a person is
that he starts imitating somebody.</p><p>Respect Jesus and Buddha and Krishna and Lao Tzu and Zarathustra --
and there have been many other people of tremendous insight. Respect
them, listen to their music, try to understand their hints, but never be
an imitator, never be a follower. Just be yourself.</p><p>(Then Osho talked about another aspect of how we loss track of our
real nature -</p><p>- by trying to impose character on ourselves instead of allowing our
consciousness to flower.) If one follows the first route, creating a
character, one goes pseudo, one becomes false, and split also.</p><p>One becomes two persons because the very method of creating a
character is that of repression -- there is no other method. You have to
repress your nature and you have to act according to certain principles
decided by others. They tell you that is right and that is wrong, what
is good and what is bad. They have already given you ten commandments
and you have to follow them, Now what will you do with your nature?</p><p>The only thing possible is that you repress your nature you neglect
it, ignore it. But nature cannot be changed in this way; it goes on
nagging you from within</p><p>and It goes on forcing you to go against the character that you have
cultivated; hence all the hypocrisy. It is very rare to find a religious
person who is not a hypocrite. And a person is really religious only
when be is not a hypocrite.</p><p>Hypocrisy means you pretend to be something which you are not. You
know it, it hurts, hence it creates sadness. The whole world is full of
sadness because the whole world has been directed to create character,
morality.</p><p>My effort here is just the opposite. I am not interested in character
at all, in morality st all. I sm not telling people to be immoral, I am
telling people to be conscious, to create consciousness.</p><p>And that is what meditation is meant for. It is a method to create
consciousness. It makes you more alert, more aware, and as you become
more aware your life starts changing. But now you are not
<em>trying</em> to change; it changes because of your awareness. Now you
can see more clearly; your clarity makes you go towards the right. Not
that you have to go towards the right according to Moses or Manu or
somebody else; you simply have to be clear and your clarity determines
everything. It becomes the only source of decision, Now decisions are
not coming from the outside, you are living your own insight. Your life
will not be divided, vou will not be a hypocrite. You will be one thing
and you will do the same thing, Your doing and your being will have a
deep harmony, and when doing and being are harmonious life is a joy, it
is a dance.</p><p>Good has to come out of consciousness, not out of cultivation or
character. Real morality is born out of ccnsciousness. So that has to be
the focus, everything else is non-essential. The essential thing is
awareness.</p><p>(Osho spoke next to Prem Puneet, a town-planner who hailed from
Holland.) Love brings a purity, not vice versa. It has been said again
and again by the priests in the past that if you are pure then your life
will have the fragrance of love. That is wrong. If one waits for it, it
is never going to happen, because how will you be pure?</p><p>Love is nothing but a process of purification. When you love you
become aware of jealousy; if you don't love you will never even become
aware of jealousy. That's why the so-called saints decide not to love
--</p><p>because that keeps their jealousy fast asleep. It is there, dormant,
and because it is dormant they are not aware of it and nobody else is
aware of it. But one is not</p><p>free of it. It is there, like a seed waiting for its time, and any
moment it can sprout; any situation and it can start growing. The
potential is there, Love makes you aware of jealousy, of possessiveness,
of domination, of ego and a thousand other trips, One can simply drop
love and all those things will disappear, but only from your
consciousness. They will become part of your unconscious, they will go
underground. But you are not free of them.</p><p>The saints have been very much afraid of love for the simple reason
that it makes you aware of things which you don't want to be aware
of,</p><p>My effort here is to help you to be more loving because love brings
all kinds of things to the surface. It is a revelation. Of course there
is great pain in it because to know that you are jealous is to know that
you are ugly; to know that you are possessive is to know that you are
not what you should be; to know that you are always trying in some way
or other to dominate is not a good feeling, It hurts to see all this
madness in 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:- oneself.</p><p>The saints, the so-called saints, have chosen a cheap way: just drop
love and all things will disappear from your vision.</p><p>My effort is for you to go deeper into love so you can bring all
these things totally to the surface, so that you can even know their
very roots -- not only the leaves and the branches but the roots. And
the day you come to know their roots you can throw them out.</p><p>Love is a process of purification, but a painful process. All growth
is painful, hence people have decided not to grow, it is too painful.
But then you miss the whole opportunity. Then one remains retarded
--</p><p>psychologically, spiritually, very retarded. You can see the whole
humanity living in a retarded way.</p><p>Nobody is really grown-up because people have avoided the pain that
is inevitable in growth.</p><p>So one has to accept the pain very understandingly. No need to make a
fuss about it, no need to magnify it; one just has to accept it, the way
you accept surgery, the way you accept an operation. You know that there
is going to be a little pain but that has to be accepted. You
understandingly accept it.</p><p>If one can accept the pain then one can soon go beyond it. The deeper
your acceptance of it, the quicker you go beyond it. A man of real
intelligence can even go beyond it in a single moment. But in that
single moment he will have to suffer hell because the whole of the pain
will explode with such intensity that you will feel you are in hell. But
if you can accept it, not in a reluctant way, not in any resistant way,
if you allow it because it is natural, it has to be so; nothing can be
done about it; if you can accept it in a relaxed way you will go beyond
it, you will transcend it. And then you are purified, purified of all
poisons. Use love as a process of purification.</p><p>Love is the beginning and love is the end, or course in the middle
there is pain, but it is worth it. Once you have come to purification
you will know what you have attained is millions of times more valuable
than all the pain that you have gone through, That pain seems so tiny.
But it is later on only. When you are passing through the pain it looks
very big because you have nothing else to compare it with.</p><p>When the explosion of bliss happens then you know that the pain was
nothing, it was just a nightmare.</p><p>But passing through a nightmare, although it is only a dream, is
painful. When you wake up you know, you laugh at it -- but that happens
only later on.</p><p>The first thing that Bodhidharma did when he became enlightened was
to laugh. It is said that tor seven days he was laughing and laughing.
His friends, other meditators, started enquiring, "Have you gone mad or
something?" He said, "I was mad, now I am sane. And I am laughing
because it looked so big. But I was making a mountain out of a molehill;
it was nothing, Now that I have gained is so much that that price was
almost nothing. Just for a song I have attained the ultimate."</p><p>Hence the presence of a Master is helpful, In those moments of pain
and anguish</p><p>and anxiety you can always look up to him, you can always see that
there is a future because he represents your future. He is what you will
be one day. In seeing him trust arises, in loving him one passes through
the pain more comfortably, more easily.</p><p>Yes, if the trust is total one can pass through the pain almost
painlessly. So it all depends on how much trust is there, how much
surrender is there Sannyas is surrender, sannyas is trust, sannyas is a
deep let-go!</p><p>(An apt name for a child psychologist, Anand Daya means bliss and
compassion, Osho explained to the Dutch woman before him.)</p><p>Anand Daya means bliss and compassion.</p><p>Bliss happens inside, compassion is its outer expression. Bliss
happens at your very center and compassion is its circumference. A man
of bliss is inevitably a man of deep compassion and love.</p><p>If there is no compassion that means bliss has not happened, that
that man is dreaming about it, he is hallucinating, he is in an
illusion. Compassion is the proof that something real has happened.</p><p>Because of this fact, that compassion proves that bliss has happened,
many people have tried to be compassionate. So they have tried the other
way round because that seems easier. You can be very compassionate
towards the poor and the sick and the old and the miserable. That's what
all the Christian missionaries are doing. They are trying to be
compassionate, but their compassion is superficial, very superficial and
shallow. Bliss has not happened.</p><p>Remember, if bliss happens compassion is bound to follow. You can
create a compassionate character around yourself but bliss is not bound
to follow because the center transforms the circumference, not vice
versa. The circumference cannot transform the center.</p><p>The roots change the leaves but the leaves cannot change the roots.
If the roots are healthy the leaves are 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on

you can make them as green as you want, you can paint them, but those
leaves are dying. Your paint will kill them sooner than they would have
died on their own. It will quicken their death, it will speed up their
death; they will become dead sooner.</p><p>And that's what has happened to your saints; they are trying to paint
the leaves, they are trying to paint the flowers.</p><p>It is not only with ordinary people, not only with women; the saints
are the same. Women are trying to paint their cheeks red and their lips
with lipstick and everything. I don't know who they are befooling!</p><p>Lipstick looks so ugly that only a stupid woman can do it. But
stupidity is very prevalent. Now they are trying to deceive people that
they have such healthy lips. If your lips are healthy it is perfectly
good, but by painting them you are really destroying them. You are not
allowing them the sun and the air because they are covered by some ugly
paint.</p><p>But the same is the case with your so-called saints -- it is the same
humanity and the same logic. They are painted people, their compassion
is just something painted.</p><p>My sannyasins have to remember it. I don't teach compassion because
it has deceived many people. I teach bliss. Forget all about others, the
first thing has to happen within you. And the moment it happens you will
be able to share with others. That is going to happen naturally; there
is no need to worry about it. It is an absolute inevitability, it is a
by-product!</p><p>(Then Osho wound up the evening by talking about the beauty
meditation creates in and around the meditator.)</p><p>Meditation does two things to you: one: it makes you aware of the
beauty that exists all around, it makes you sensitive to it; and the
second thing: it makes you beautiful, it gives you a certain grace. Your
eyes become full of beauty because the whole existence is beautiful. We
just have to drink out of it, we just have to allow the beauty to enter
us. Through our eyes, through our ears, through all our senses; the
beauty has to be allowed to enter us. It gives tremendous nourishment to
the soul.</p><p>Ordinarily a person is not aware of the beauty that surrounds
existence. He is more aware of all that is ugly because the mind always
goes on finding the negative. It counts the thorns, it misses the roses.
It counts the wounds, it misses the blessings. That's the way of the
mind.</p><p>Mind basically is negative, its whole approach is negative. It thinks
only of dark things. From the past it goes on collecting dark things and
about the future it goes on projecting dark things. It lives surrounded
by a dark world of its own creation. And of course then life seems to be
a great hell, The moment you move into meditation, the moment you become
a little more silent, a little more calm and quiet, more relaxed, more
resting in your being, you suddenly become aware of the beauty of the
trees, of the beauty of the clouds, the beauty of people, of everything
that is there.</p><p>Everything is beautiful because it is all full of god; even rocks are
overflowing with godliness. Nothing is empty Or god. And once you start
experiencing all these beautiful dimensions the ultimate result is that
you are so nourished by your beautiful experiences -- by music, by
poetry, by dance, by celebration, by love that <em>you</em> become
beautiful. A natural outcome is that a great grace arises in your being.
It starts radiating.</p><p>Everybody can see it, unless one is determined not to; that is
another matter. If one wants to see it, it is there. That's why we have
surrounded all the pictures of Jesus and Buddha and Zarathustra with
light: a grace surrounds them. But people who are determined to remain
with closed eyes, of course, they cannot see it.</p><p>To be a disciple means now you will be seeing your Master with open
eyes, you will no longer be blind towards the Master, that you will put
your mind aside, that you will look without the mind, without the
interference of the mind, without any interpretation, that you will look
directly.</p><p>With the master one relates heart to heart, not mind to mind. And
then one can see the beauty that has happened. And if it can happen to
one person it can happen to everybody. It is everybody's birthright.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=just-the-tip-of-the-iceberg>Just the Tip of the Iceberg</h3><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-4>Osho's books on

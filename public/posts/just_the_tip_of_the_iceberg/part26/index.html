It is for reference purposes only.]\n(Osho reiterated in his address to a professor from Germany, a theme on which he touched on the evening of the twenty-first -- the synthesis of love and peace; tonight he exchanged \"bliss\" for love but it was essentially the same message. The two -- bliss and love -- can be experienced together, he said.) When I say this is possible I am not only philosophising about it, I have experienced it and I have observed thousands of sannyasins experiencing it. Now it is no more just an experiment, it is a proved hynothesis.\n(Meditation is not inimical but actually medicinal for the mind, observed Osho in his address to Dhyan Rosalie.)\nMind is a mechanism -- a beautiful mechanism, of tremendous importance, but\nthere is no need to keep it on for twenty-four hours a day, day in, day out. It is tiring, it becomes too hot. It starts burning its own tissues.\nThat's why children seem to be more intelligent than older people, for the simple reason that their delicate tissues are still alive. Their engines are brand-new, their computers are not yet over-burdened. And mind is a biological computer.\nAnd remember... Fifty years ago one of the great Indian scientists discovered something; now many other scientists have come to the same discovery. His name was Jagdish Chandra Bashu. He was laughed at.\nHe said, \"Just as there is mental fatigue there is metal fatigue. Even metal gets tired, even metal needs rest.\"\nHe was laughed at. Of course he was a Nobel prize-winner, one of the greatest scientists India has ever given to the world, but it took fifty years for the scientific world to recognize what a tremendous insight he had given it.\nNow it is a well-established fact, that everything tires, and the more delicate a thing is, the more easily it tires. And your mind is a very delicate phenomenon. In such a small space, the head, you are carrying a computer bigger than any which has yet been invented. Scientists say if we were to create a computer like the human brain we would need almost the same space as a huge city takes to install it, because a single human brain can contain all the information that is contained in all the books of the world; that its capacity.\nIt consists of seven hundred million cells and each cell can contain infinite information, almost infinite information.\nSo I am not against the mind, in fact I am all for it. 4nd that's why I want that it be given a little rest. The poor mind is continuously working. You are sleeping; the body rests but the mind continues dreaming, chattering.\nI sometimes suspect that when people die, even in their graves their minds must be continuing ... old habits! The mind must be chattering, still planning for tomorrow, not knowing that you are in the grave, dreaming. If it can continue in your sleep it can continue in your death too. It has something like an autonomous authority, and we have completely forgotten how to put it off.\nThat's the whole secret of meditation: it is a method of putting it off. It can be\nput off very easily, you just have to be a witness. Just watching your mind ... and you easily become aware that just by watching, doing nothing else, no chanting of a mantra .o. because that is again the working of the mind. No need to chant a mantra. That is stupid; you are again a victim of the same mind. No need to repeat and recite a prayer, because that is mind-work.\nWitnessing the mind, listening to its noise, aware of it all -- thoughts passing, the whole traffic of memories, desires, imagination, dreams -- just standing by the side of the road and seeing the whole traffic...\nAnd it is always rush hour as far as the mind is concerned! Just watching it, a miracle happens, because watching is the only thing in you which is not of the mind, which belongs to your being, to your soul.\nThe moment you watch you are just a consciousness, and immediately something starts settling in your consciousness, and the mind and you are separate. The moment you know that you are not the mind, you are out of the mind, your cooperation with the mind stops. And that is the whole method of putting the ignition off. It is your energy that keeps it on. When you are separate your cooperation disappears and the mind comes to a halt, immediately to a halt. That is the state of meditation, absolute silence. In that silence you 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nstart opening up your petals, your consciousness becomes a roseflower. And that is the meaning of Rosalie: a roseflower.\nOnly in deep silence does the spring come to your soul, flowers bloom, fragrance is released. And when your consciousness blossoms there is tremendous fulfilment, contentment, bliss, peace, truth, freedom. All the great values come as a by-product of meditation.\nI don't think any communist has gone through all his books -- they are tiring, very tiring. I don't think that even he himself read them all! Going through his books was a kind of self-torture, but I did it. And after searching through his great, voluminous works I agreed with only one statement, and that is the\nstatement at the end of his Communist Manifesto where he says: Proletariat of the world unite, because you have nothing to lose but your chains. With that statement I agree. Of course I have my own meaning -- Karl Marx may not agree with it.\nI call a proletariat a person who is miserable. he may be rich or poor, that is not important. A proletariat is one who has not known his inner kingdom. He may be a Rockefeller or a Morgan or a Ford. Jesus is not a proletariat although he comes from a very poor family. He is the richest man the world has ever known --\nthe uneducated son of a carpenter.\nThe proletariat is one who has nothing. His whole being is empty -- no joy, no peace, no understanding.\nHe is a beggar, and beggars have nothing to lose except their chains. But a problem arises: we become so accustomed even to chains that we cling to them.\nIt is a well-known fact that once a person is imprisoned he returns again and again to gaol. That fact has not been yet considered by our so-called lawyers, judges. They still go on punishing people, they still go on carrying the idea that punishment is going to prevent them from committing a crime. In fact, our gaols are universities to teach crime! because once a person is imprisoned for five years he becomes accustomed to gaol; in fact he starts liking it. Life is very easy: you don't have to bother about employment, about the rising prices of things. You will get tea every day at the right time, and your lunch and your breakfast and everything; you need not bother about shelter and clothes. And just by paying the price of chains life becomes so easy, comfortable, that who wants to come out?\nSo once a prisoner is released he immediately finds another excuse to go in. This fact has not yet been taken into account. He becomes habituated to the life of a prisoner. The outside world scares him; he feels afraid. The moment you throw him out of gaol you throw him out of his home! Now he has to search for a place to live, some work to do. He has to earn money and the whole struggle to survive.… Suddenly he sees that it is better to be back in gaol. These prisoners are called gaolbirds -- they always come back. And it is true about almost ninety-eight percent of criminals, they always come back.\nPeople start clinging even to their chains -- they give them a certain comfort.\nPeople cling to misery. It needs courage to drop the known, great courage to risk the known for the unknown. It is a gamble.\nSannyas is a gamble. It is risking your known life for something unknown, That's why a master is needed to persuade you, to push you, to seduce you towards the unknown. A master is needed whom you can trust, whose love you can trust, whose presence gives you the confidence to take the step into the unknown, to take your small boat into the uncharted sea. Once you have entered into the unknown then there is no problem: you know that is bliss, that is truth, that is god. Then one never looks back. But to drop the safety of the shore, to drop the safety of the known and the familiar, one needs courage.\nI don't say to my sannyasins to renounce the world, I say renounce misery, renounce the known, and always be ready to go into the unknown, into the new, because that is the way to god.\nThese are the three words to be contemplated: the known, which is misery; the unknown, which is the way towards god; and the unknowable, which is another name for god. Move from the known into the unknown, and the unknown will take you to the unknowable, to the ultimate mystery of existence.\n(Tomaso was described on the darshan list as being a teacher from Italy.) Meditation makes you innocent, and it will not be difficult for you because you are an innocent person.\nYou are just like a child. It is very rare to come across a child of your age! You could not even keep your eyes closed!\nThat is beautiful -- I loved it -- you were looking in between, many times. But that's good!\nAnd I have heard many stories about you... that every day you go to the meditation and you read my books there. That's good! That's what meditation is all about!\nJust be like a child -- and you are. Don't be worried about the world. The world is cunning and the world condemns simple people. You are a simple person, hence meditation will come very naturally to you and is 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nbound to happen. Meditation creates the right space within you, it prepares the ground.\nAnd for you, this is a good meditation; you can just sit silently with closed eyes. That will be a little hard so you can open them a few times -- nothing to worry about! Once in a while looking around is perfectly okay!\nAnd truth is not far away; if one is simple it is bound to happen. It is a gift of god to all simple people.\nYou have come to the right place. Italy is not the right place for simple people! It is good for the Mafia, but for.…\nSo now enjoy being here. Dance, sing, and for the first time in your life relax, because there is no need to be clever here. Right?\nSo be here!\n(His way lay beyond the ego, Osho told Veet Atto, an agriculture student from Italy.) The only problem is the ego, but it creates thousands of other problems; it is the root cause. And I am not interested in pruning the leaves and the branches\n-- cut the root -- because that is a futile effort, cutting leaves and branches; they will grow again. And all the religions have become too much concerned with the leavres and the branches, and by cutting them nothing is going to happen.\nThe problem with the roots is that they are always underground; you cannot see them. And that's how ego is, it is always underground. You see greed, you see anger, you see sex, you see ambition; these are all above the ground. Jealousy, possessiveness, domination, they are all above the ground. But they are only symptoms. And never treat the symptoms -- cut the root, go to the very root, and then in a single blow life can be transformed.\nThe ego is a false entity. It is an invented centre which exists not. It is a cheap way to create some identity. To discover the real centre needs courage, needs deep meditation, needs inner searching, a soul-searching. So people have found a short-cut: rather than finding the real centre they create a plastic centre. It is\ncheap, easy. That's what ego is. Ego simply means you don't know who you are, still you think you know.\nThis false knowing has to be dropped. It is better to accept that you don't know; that is a first step towards truth. Dionysius calls it \"agnosia\", a state of not- knowing.\nSo these are the three states: ignorance.… In ignorance a person does not know but thinks he knows. The second is agnosia: a state of not-knowing. A person still does not know, but he knows that he does not know\n-- and that is a tremendous growth. And the third is realisation, enlightenment, awakening Buddhahood, when a person knows that he knows.\nMillions are living in the first state. Sannyas means moving to the second. And then the third comes or its own, you need not do anything. You just remain in the second, watching so that the first does not come in from some back door. Remain in a state of not-knowing, remain innocent, childlike, wondering about it all but not creating false knowledge to hide your ignorance, and the ego disappears.\nThe moment the ego disappears your real being reveals itself. And then there is light and then there is abundant life and then there is an infinity of love overflowing. By going beyond the ego one goes beyond both time and space and enters into the ultimate. Less than that cannot satisfy, less that that is not worthwhile.\nThis is the goal for a sannyasin -- the ultimate realisation of god or truth or nirvana.\n(Life can be travelled via the highway of the head or of the heart, Osho told us.) The method of the head is analysis and the method of the heart is synthesis.\nWhen you analyse something you destroy its life. For example, if you give a rose flower to a chemist and you tell him \"Look, what a beautiful flower it is!n he will say \"I will have to dissect it. I will have to find where the beauty is.\" And he will analyse the flower. He will find how much earth is there and how much water and other chemicals, but he will not find beauty because beauty is not a chemical, beauty is not matter. He will simply deny it, he will say there is no beauty.\nBut the poet or the painter, they approach life through a totally different way. For them chemicals do not matter, matter does not matter. For them beauty is the most significant phenomenon. They will dance and rejoice. Their way of seeing is through love. Love reveals beauty, logic destroys it.\nAll that medical science knows about man is about dead bodies, because they go on doing post-mortems on dead bodies. Even if you cut up a living body, the moment you cut it, it will be dead. So whatsoever medical science knows about man is about a dead man, not about an alive man. That's why they will deny 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nthat there is a soul, because they have not found it. They cannot put it in a test tube; it is not observable either. It is a totally different world: it is found through the heart.\nAnalysis is not the way to find the ultimate truth, the living truth. Analysis is right as far as matter is concerned. Synthesis is the right approach towards life. And that's what I teach here.\nBring your energy from the head to the heart, move from logic to love. And love will give you new insight; it will open your third eye. It is just a metaphor -- there is not a third eye really. Otherwise there are fools who start thinking of a third eye as if something like these two eyes is there inside. Then again you are thinking in terms of matter, and the medical science will deny it because they know there is no third eye.\nThe third eye is only a metaphor, it is poetry. It is just a way of saying that love has its own way of knowing and seeing.\nIt is said about Majnu... the story of Majnu is a Sufi story, a great love story. This young man Majnu fell in love with a woman, Laila. These are metaphors for Sufis. It is not just a love story, it has a deeper meaning too. The mundane can enjoy it as a love story and the meditators can enjoy it as a tremendous story of the love between man and god.\nLaila was not beautiful; she was very homely or maybe she was even ugly. She was not even fair-skinned, she was dark. And Majnu was so mad after her that the whole town became compassionate towards Majnu. The parents were absolutely against this love affair -- parents are always against love affairs. And they were rich people and Majnu was poor .\nEven the king became interested in the whole phenomenon, because many times he heard Majnu passing by the side of the palace shouting \"Laila! Laila! Laila!\" He was continuously repeating the name of Laila as if it were a name of god, and he was continuously weeping and crying.\nOne day the king called him and said, \"Because of you, I myself became interested in Laila. Thinking that she must be a very beautiful woman I called her to the court and I was surprised -- you must be mad --\nshe is a very ordinary woman, in fact ugly, and I feel much for you. So look, I have called twelve beautiful girls from my own palace and you can choose any. These are the most beautiful girls in the whole country.\"\nMajnu looked very closely at each girl and shook his head.\nThe king said, \"You must be insane! These are the most beautiful girls and you are saying no to them for that ugly woman. I don't see the point!\"\nMajnu said, \"You don't understand, sir. To know the beauty of Laila, you need the eyes of a Majnu!\nUnless you have my eyes you cannot see her beauty. I love her!\"\nThis is a tremendous insight. People think that they love somebody because the person is beautiful; that is wrong. The person looks beautiful because you love them. Love comes first, then the person becomes beautiful. It is love that beautifies the person, not vice versa, not that the person is beautiful, that's why you have fallen in love. Just the opposite is the case: you have fallen in love and the person looks beautiful.\nLove creates beauty, reveals beauty. For love there is nothing ugly. As your love grows, the whole existence starts becoming beautiful. When your love is perfect this is the most perfect existence that can be.\nWhen your love is absolute then everything is divine, then everywhere is god, because the eyes of love can only see god and nothing else.\nJust the Tip of the Iceberg Chapter #27\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"3344","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/just_the_tip_of_the_iceberg/part26/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/just_the_tip_of_the_iceberg/>Just The Tip Of The Iceberg</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>16 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;3344 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Just_The_Tip_Of_The_Iceberg/part26.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part25>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

observed Osho in his address to Dhyan Rosalie.)</p><p>Mind is a mechanism -- a beautiful mechanism, of tremendous
importance, but</p><p>there is no need to keep it on for twenty-four hours a day, day in,
day out. It is tiring, it becomes too hot. It starts burning its own
tissues.</p><p>That's why children seem to be more intelligent than older people,
for the simple reason that their delicate tissues are still alive. Their
engines are brand-new, their computers are not yet over-burdened. And
mind <em>is</em> a biological computer.</p><p>And remember... Fifty years ago one of the great Indian scientists
discovered something; now many other scientists have come to the same
discovery. His name was Jagdish Chandra Bashu. He was laughed at.</p><p>He said, "Just as there is mental fatigue there is metal fatigue.
Even metal gets tired, even metal needs rest."</p><p>He was laughed at. Of course he was a Nobel prize-winner, one of the
greatest scientists India has ever given to the world, but it took fifty
years for the scientific world to recognize what a tremendous insight he
had given it.</p><p>Now it is a well-established fact, that everything tires, and the
more delicate a thing is, the more easily it tires. And your mind is a
very delicate phenomenon. In such a small space, the head, you are
carrying a computer bigger than any which has yet been invented.
Scientists say if we were to create a computer like the human brain we
would need almost the same space as a huge city takes to install it,
because a single human brain can contain all the information that is
contained in all the books of the world; that its capacity.</p><p>It consists of seven hundred million cells and each cell can contain
infinite information, almost infinite information.</p><p>So I am not against the mind, in fact I am all for it. 4nd that's why
I want that it be given a little rest. The poor mind is continuously
working. You are sleeping; the body rests but the mind continues
dreaming, chattering.</p><p>I sometimes suspect that when people die, even in their graves their
minds must be continuing ... old habits! The mind must be chattering,
still planning for tomorrow, not knowing that you are in the grave,
dreaming. If it can continue in your sleep it can continue in your death
too. It has something like an autonomous authority, and we have
completely forgotten how to put it off.</p><p>That's the whole secret of meditation: it is a method of putting it
off. It can be</p><p>put off very easily, you just have to be a witness. Just watching
your mind ... and you easily become aware that just by watching, doing
nothing else, no chanting of a mantra .o. because that is again the
working of the mind. No need to chant a mantra. That is stupid; you are
again a victim of the same mind. No need to repeat and recite a prayer,
because that is mind-work.</p><p>Witnessing the mind, listening to its noise, aware of it all --
thoughts passing, the whole traffic of memories, desires, imagination,
dreams -- just standing by the side of the road and seeing the whole
traffic...</p><p>And it is always rush hour as far as the mind is concerned! Just
watching it, a miracle happens, because watching is the only thing in
you which is not of the mind, which belongs to your being, to your
soul.</p><p>The moment you watch you are just a consciousness, and immediately
something starts settling in your consciousness, and the mind and you
are separate. The moment you know that you are not the mind, you are out
of the mind, your cooperation with the mind stops. And that is the whole
method of putting the ignition off. It is your energy that keeps it on.
When you are separate your cooperation disappears and the mind comes to
a halt, immediately to a halt. That is the state of meditation, absolute
silence. In that silence you 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on

roseflower. And that is the meaning of Rosalie: a roseflower.</p><p>Only in deep silence does the spring come to your soul, flowers
bloom, fragrance is released. And when your consciousness blossoms there
is tremendous fulfilment, contentment, bliss, peace, truth, freedom. All
the great values come as a by-product of meditation.</p><p>I don't think any communist has gone through all his books -- they
are tiring, very tiring. I don't think that even he himself read them
all! Going through his books was a kind of self-torture, but I did it.
And after searching through his great, voluminous works I agreed with
only one statement, and that is the</p><p>statement at the end of his Communist Manifesto where he says:
Proletariat of the world unite, because you have nothing to lose but
your chains. With that statement I agree. Of course I have my own
meaning -- Karl Marx may not agree with it.</p><p>I call a proletariat a person who is miserable. he may be rich or
poor, that is not important. A proletariat is one who has not known his
inner kingdom. He may be a Rockefeller or a Morgan or a Ford. Jesus is
not a proletariat although he comes from a very poor family. He is the
richest man the world has ever known --</p><p>the uneducated son of a carpenter.</p><p>The proletariat is one who has nothing. His whole being is empty --
no joy, no peace, no understanding.</p><p>He is a beggar, and beggars have nothing to lose except their chains.
But a problem arises: we become so accustomed even to chains that we
cling to them.</p><p>It is a well-known fact that once a person is imprisoned he returns
again and again to gaol. That fact has not been yet considered by our
so-called lawyers, judges. They still go on punishing people, they still
go on carrying the idea that punishment is going to prevent them from
committing a crime. In fact, our gaols are universities to teach crime!
because once a person is imprisoned for five years he becomes accustomed
to gaol; in fact he starts liking it. Life is very easy: you don't have
to bother about employment, about the rising prices of things. You will
get tea every day at the right time, and your lunch and your breakfast
and everything; you need not bother about shelter and clothes. And just
by paying the price of chains life becomes so easy, comfortable, that
who wants to come out?</p><p>So once a prisoner is released he immediately finds another excuse to
go in. This fact has not yet been taken into account. He becomes
habituated to the life of a prisoner. The outside world scares him; he
feels afraid. The moment you throw him out of gaol you throw him out of
his home! Now he has to search for a place to live, some work to do. He
has to earn money and the whole struggle to survive.… Suddenly he sees
that it is better to be back in gaol. These prisoners are called
gaolbirds -- they always come back. And it is true about almost
ninety-eight percent of criminals, they always come back.</p><p>People start clinging even to their chains -- they give them a
certain comfort.</p><p>People cling to misery. It needs courage to drop the known, great
courage to risk the known for the unknown. It is a gamble.</p><p>Sannyas is a gamble. It is risking your known life for something
unknown, That's why a master is needed to persuade you, to push you, to
seduce you towards the unknown. A master is needed whom you can trust,
whose love you can trust, whose presence gives you the confidence to
take the step into the unknown, to take your small boat into the
uncharted sea. Once you have entered into the unknown then there is no
problem: you know that is bliss, that is truth, that is god. Then one
never looks back. But to drop the safety of the shore, to drop the
safety of the known and the familiar, one needs courage.</p><p>I don't say to my sannyasins to renounce the world, I say renounce
misery, renounce the known, and always be ready to go into the unknown,
into the new, because that is the way to god.</p><p>These are the three words to be contemplated: the known, which is
misery; the unknown, which is the way towards god; and the unknowable,
which is another name for god. Move from the known into the unknown, and
the unknown will take you to the unknowable, to the ultimate mystery of
existence.</p><p>(Tomaso was described on the darshan list as being a teacher from
Italy.) Meditation makes you innocent, and it will not be difficult for
you because you are an innocent person.</p><p>You are just like a child. It is very rare to come across a child of
your age! You could not even keep your eyes closed!</p><p>That is beautiful -- I loved it -- you were looking in between, many
times. But that's good!</p><p>And I have heard many stories about you... that every day you go to
the meditation and you read my books there. That's good! That's what
meditation is all about!</p><p>Just be like a child -- and you are. Don't be worried about the

perfectly okay!</p><p>And truth is not far away; if one is simple it is bound to happen. It

life relax, because there is no need to be clever here. Right?</p><p>So be here!</p><p>(His way lay beyond the ego, Osho told Veet Atto, an agriculture
student from Italy.) The only problem is the ego, but it creates
thousands of other problems; it is the root cause. And I am not
interested in pruning the leaves and the branches</p><p>-- cut the root -- because that is a futile effort, cutting leaves
and branches; they will grow again. And all the religions have become
too much concerned with the leavres and the branches, and by cutting
them nothing is going to happen.</p><p>The problem with the roots is that they are always underground; you
cannot see them. And that's how ego is, it is always underground. You
see greed, you see anger, you see sex, you see ambition; these are all
above the ground. Jealousy, possessiveness, domination, they are all
above the ground. But they are only symptoms. And never treat the
symptoms -- cut the root, go to the very root, and then in a single blow
life can be transformed.</p><p>The ego is a false entity. It is an invented centre which exists not.
It is a cheap way to create some identity. To discover the real centre
needs courage, needs deep meditation, needs inner searching, a
soul-searching. So people have found a short-cut: rather than finding
the real centre they create a plastic centre. It is</p><p>cheap, easy. That's what ego is. Ego simply means you don't know who
you are, still you think you know.</p><p>This false knowing has to be dropped. It is better to accept that you
don't know; that is a first step towards truth. Dionysius calls it
"agnosia", a state of not- knowing.</p><p>So these are the three states: ignorance.… In ignorance a person does
not know but thinks he knows. The second is agnosia: a state of
not-knowing. A person still does not know, but he knows that he does not
know</p><p>-- and that is a tremendous growth. And the third is realisation,
enlightenment, awakening Buddhahood, when a person knows that he
knows.</p><p>Millions are living in the first state. Sannyas means moving to the
second. And then the third comes or its own, you need not do anything.
You just remain in the second, watching so that the first does not come
in from some back door. Remain in a state of not-knowing, remain
innocent, childlike, wondering about it all but not creating false
knowledge to hide your ignorance, and the ego disappears.</p><p>The moment the ego disappears your real being reveals itself. And
then there is light and then there is abundant life and then there is an
infinity of love overflowing. By going beyond the ego one goes beyond
both time and space and enters into the ultimate. Less than that cannot
satisfy, less that that is not worthwhile.</p><p>This is the goal for a sannyasin -- the ultimate realisation of god
or truth or nirvana.</p><p>(Life can be travelled via the highway of the head or of the heart,
Osho told us.) The method of the head is analysis and the method of the
heart is synthesis.</p><p>When you analyse something you destroy its life. For example, if you
give a rose flower to a chemist and you tell him "Look, what a beautiful
flower it is!n he will say "I will have to dissect it. I will have to
find where the beauty is." And he will analyse the flower. He will find
how much earth is there and how much water and other chemicals, but he
will not find beauty because beauty is not a chemical, beauty is not
matter. He will simply deny it, he will say there is no beauty.</p><p>But the poet or the painter, they approach life through a totally
different way. For them chemicals do not matter, <em>matter</em> does
not matter. For them beauty is the most significant phenomenon. They
will dance and rejoice. Their way of seeing is through love. Love
reveals beauty, logic destroys it.</p><p>All that medical science knows about man is about dead bodies,
because they go on doing post-mortems on dead bodies. Even if you cut up
a living body, the moment you cut it, it will be dead. So whatsoever
medical science knows about man is about a dead man, not about an alive
man. That's why they will deny 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>that there is a soul, because they have not found it. They cannot put
it in a test tube; it is not observable either. It is a totally
different world: it is found through the heart.</p><p>Analysis is not the way to find the ultimate truth, the living truth.
Analysis is right as far as matter is concerned. Synthesis is the right
approach towards life. And that's what I teach here.</p><p>Bring your energy from the head to the heart, move from logic to
love. And love will give you new insight; it will open your third eye.
It is just a metaphor -- there is not a third eye really. Otherwise
there are fools who start thinking of a third eye as if something like
these two eyes is there inside. Then again you are thinking in terms of
matter, and the medical science will deny it because they know there is
no third eye.</p><p>The third eye is only a metaphor, it is poetry. It is just a way of
saying that love has its own way of knowing and seeing.</p><p>It is said about Majnu... the story of Majnu is a Sufi story, a great
love story. This young man Majnu fell in love with a woman, Laila. These
are metaphors for Sufis. It is not just a love story, it has a deeper
meaning too. The mundane can enjoy it as a love story and the meditators
can enjoy it as a tremendous story of the love between man and god.</p><p>Laila was not beautiful; she was very homely or maybe she was even
ugly. She was not even fair-skinned, she was dark. And Majnu was so mad
after her that the whole town became compassionate towards Majnu. The
parents were absolutely against this love affair -- parents are always
against love affairs. And they were rich people and Majnu was poor .</p><p>Even the king became interested in the whole phenomenon, because many
times he heard Majnu passing by the side of the palace shouting "Laila!
Laila! Laila!" He was continuously repeating the name of Laila as if it
were a name of god, and he was continuously weeping and crying.</p><p>One day the king called him and said, "Because of you, I myself
became interested in Laila. Thinking that she must be a very beautiful
woman I called her to the court and I was surprised -- you must be mad
--</p><p>she is a very ordinary woman, in fact ugly, and I feel much for you.
So look, I have called twelve beautiful girls from my own palace and you
can choose any. These are the most beautiful girls in the whole
country."</p><p>Majnu looked very closely at each girl and shook his head.</p><p>The king said, "You must be insane! These are the most beautiful
girls and you are saying no to them for that ugly woman. I don't see the
point!"</p><p>Majnu said, "You don't understand, sir. To know the beauty of Laila,
you need the eyes of a Majnu!</p><p>Unless you have <em>my</em> eyes you cannot see her beauty. I love
her!"</p><p>This is a tremendous insight. People think that they love somebody
because the person is beautiful; that is wrong. The person looks
beautiful because you love them. Love comes first, then the person
becomes beautiful. It is love that beautifies the person, not vice
versa, not that the person is beautiful, that's why you have fallen in
love. Just the opposite is the case: you have fallen in love and the
person looks beautiful.</p><p>Love creates beauty, reveals beauty. For love there is nothing ugly.
As your love grows, the whole existence starts becoming beautiful. When
your love is perfect this is the most perfect existence that can be.</p><p>When your love is absolute then everything is divine, then everywhere
is god, because the eyes of love can only see god and nothing else.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=just-the-tip-of-the-iceberg>Just the Tip of the Iceberg</h3><p>Chapter #27</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part25>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

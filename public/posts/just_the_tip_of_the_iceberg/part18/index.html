It is for reference purposes only.]\n(Osho began the evening by talking about bliss as a flowering of aloneness.) Bliss means courage, nothing else. It is already there inside, but to go inside is not for the cowards because the coward always wants company, a crowd. He feels at ease with the crowd; surrounded by people he feels secure. The coward is like a sheep. The sheep is perfectly happy with the crowd; alone, great fear arises.\nAn inside journey is a journey towards absolute aloneness; you cannot take anybody there with you.\nYou cannot share your centre with anybody, not even with your beloved. It is not in the nature of things; nothing can be done about it. It is easier to go to the moon because you can have company. Even if you don't have company you can have a connection with the earth; you can phone the people here. You can get directions from the outside, from the far away earth, but still you are connected. The moment you go in, all connections with the outside world are broken; all bridges are broken. In fact, the whole world disappears.\nThat's why the mystics have called the world illusory, maya, not that it does not exist but for the meditator, one who goes in, it is almost as if it does not exist.\nThe silence is so profound; no noise penetrates it. The aloneness is so deep that one needs guts. But out of that aloneness explodes bliss. Out of that aloneness, the experience of god. There is no other way; there has never been any and there is never going to be.\n(Because John was the name of the most loved disciple of Jesus, the name has that connotation, Osho explained to a Dutch analyst. And then he described the three different kinds of people who seek truth.) One is the student. His enquiry is mental, of the head, intellectual. He wants to gather a little knowledge of what truth is all about; his enquiry is superficial. The second category consists of disciples. Their enquiry is of the heart, not of the head. They really want to know truth, not just knowledge about truth; they want to experience it. They are not satisfied with mere knowledge, they want an authentic experience. Hence the disciple moves on a different plane from the student, the scholar. The student collects information, the 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\ndisciple asks for transformation.\nAnd the third category consists of the devotees. They are those to whom the transformation has happened , who have come to experience, to taste, who have found a glimpse of truth. The disciple is still seeking, the devotee has arrived. That is the third category.\nOnly a disciple can become a devotee. The student cannot become a devotee; first he will have to become a disciple. If the student remains a student for his whole life he will be missing the whole point. He will talk about truth, about love, about god, about meditation. But all knowledge is borrowed, it is not his own experience. The disciple has a little bit of experience because he moves from logic to love, from head to heart. The heart is closer to being. The student is in the head, the disciple in the heart, and the devotee reaches his very being. But nobody can bypass disciplehood -- it is a must.\nAnd the only thing that can make you really a disciple and ultimately a devotee is meditation. One has to learn how to be silent, still, calm and quiet. The\nmoment you know the art of being silent, the miracle starts happening. You start becoming a beloved disciple, you are no more an ordinary disciple. And when meditation is complete, entire, you are transformed into a devotee. Then the whole world is divine. For a devotee all is god; except for god, nothing exists.\nThat is the goal of sannyas. One may come here as a student, but one should not go from here as a student. If one goes as a disciple one has taken a great jump. And if you are a disciple then it is not very difficult to be a devotee. The first gap is bigger -- from the student to the disciple. The first change is very radical; the second change is very gradual. It comes on its own, of its own accord; you need not strive for it.\nThe disciple one day naturally becomes a devotee, but it is not so with the student. The student may remain a student for his whole life. The pundits, the scholars, the theologians, the professors, the philosophers --\nthey remain only students.\nSannyas means disciplehood, and sannyas is fulfilled when you have become a devotee. When the trees and the mountains and the sun and the moon and the stars, all represent one reality, one god, you have come home.\nPankaj means a lotus, and the lotus has always represented something of tremendous value. Two things particularly have to be remembered. One: the lotus grows out of mud -- the most beautiful flower grows out of dirty mud. It means that the dirty mud contains something beautiful. So don't reject the dirty mud, because it contains lotuses.\nOne has to know the art of how to grow lotuses. And it is a miracle, one cannot believe it! If one has not seen a lotus growing out of mud one cannot believe it; one cannot conceive that this beautiful flower, this delicate flower, with such fragrance, with such colour, has come out of ordinary mud.\nMan is born as ordinary mud, but man contains a lotus -- just in the seed. Man has not to be rejected, man has to be accepted and transformed. The world has not to be denied, because it contains something infinitely beautiful. It is not on the surface, it has to be brought to the surface.\nHence I am not against anything: not against body, not against the world, not against the outside. I am not against anything, but I am for transforming\neverything. Whatsoever god has given is something valuable; if we cannot understand its value it is our fault, our limited vision.\nThe second thing to be remembered about the lotus is: it lives in the water, but the water touches it not.\nIt has such velvety petals that even if dewdrops gather on those petals they remain separate. That's why on a lotus petal the dewdrop looks so beautiful, it looks like a pearl because the lotus remains untouched.\nThat's why I say it precisely defines my vision of sannyas. A sannyasin has to live in the world but has to remain untouched like a lotus. I am not for renunciation, I don't teach escapism. I teach live in the world but don't let the world enter you. Be in the world but don't be of the world. Remain aloof, remain cool, remain untouched. And then the world has much to teach you. The world is a device of god; it is a situation in which to grow and mature. Those who escape remain retarded.\nI have come across many people in the Himalayas who have lived the life of an escapist for their whole life, for thirty years, forty years, fifty years. But they look retarded, they don't look intelligent; they don't have the sharpness. Their sword has gathered rust because they escaped from the challenges of life.\nLive in life -- all those challenges are good. It is only through those challenges that one grows. Growth comes through the hard way. Never choose the easy way, otherwise you will remain immature. Never choose the short-cut, otherwise you will miss many scenes and scenery on the way. Live life in its totality, intensely but with awareness. Awareness becomes like a velvety coating on you and keeps you separate from the world. And that very art is sannyas.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\n(The real Christian is Christ, Osho told a German psychologist.) Friedrich Nietzsche has said that the first and the last Christian died on the cross two\nthousand years before -- the first and the last! And he is right. He was a madman, but about many things his insight is far deeper than that of your so-called pope!. Sometimes it happens that mad people have greater insight than the so-called sane people because the so-called sane are not really sane.\nChristians are not really interested in Christ, neither are Buddhists interested in Buddha, nor are the Hindus really interested in Krishna -- because it is not a question of worship. Christ is not Jesus' name, his name is Jesus. He attained to a certain peak of consciousness. That peak is known in the West as Christ- consciousness, in the East we call it Buddha-consciousness. It is the same, it is the same peak. There are different languages describing the same peak.\nOne can be a Christian only if one attains Christ-consciousness, and that is possible through meditation.\nNot by reading the Bible, not by going to the church, not by following the Christian ritual, not by believing in a certain dogma and creed, but by purifying your consciousness, dropping all that is unnecessary, non-essential, so that only the essential remains in you. The moment only the essential remains in you there is a great explosion of light. And that experience makes one a Christ or a Buddha or a Jina or a Krishna; it matters not what word is used.\nNever be bothered with words. Remember the meaning and forget the words.\nA man without love is like a flower without fragrance. A flower without fragrance is not of much value.\nA man without love is also not of any value at all. A man without love is an empty temple -- god is missing.\nJesus says god is love. I say love is god, I make love far more important than god, because when love comes god automatically happens. So one can ignore god but one cannot ignore love. Love is the very bridge. And by love I don't mean the love that is known ordinarily -- that is lust, it is not love. It is desire, it is not love. It is exploitation of the other as a means, it is not love.\nLove knows no lust; it is not a desire. Love is never a beggar. Love gives and never asks for any return.\nLove gives for the sheer joy of giving. Love shares one's bliss, because one\ncomes to know slowly slowly that the more you share it, the more it happens. The more you give, the more you have.\nSo it is not a question of whom to love, it is a question of being in a state of love, unaddressed, to whomsoever it may concern. No need even to put the name on it. Love addressed to a particular person becomes limited, narrow. And a narrow love is not real love; it becomes crippled. Love is so vast, you cannot narrow it down.\nIt is as stupid as somebody deciding \"Because I love you, I will breathe only in your presence. So when you are not there I will not breathe.\"\nThen the next time will never happen, the next meeting is impossible, because that man will be dead!\nEven when the lover is not there or the beloved is not there, one has to breathe. Love should be like breathing. It should not be a relationship but like breathing -\n- natural. So whosoever comes to you, your love is there just is as your breathing\nis there. If you pass by the side of a tree, your love showers on the tree. You say hello to the tree -- you can even shake hands! And when you sit on a rock, of course you enquire \"How are you?\"\nA lover is continuously in a state of love -- that's what I mean by love. Then it takes you by and by towards god. The ultimate peak of love is god. God is not a person, it is the ultimate fragrance of love, a living fragrance.\nI like to use the word \"godliness\" rather than \"god\", because god gives you a sense of a person.\nGodliness is far better because it gives you only a sense of fragrance -- a presence not a person.\nLove, and love unconditionally. Love, and love without asking for any return. Love as an end unto itself, and that is true prayer. And love the whole existence without any discrimination, without any choice. Love choicelessly, and then the day is not far away when you will become aware of godliness surrounding you, reaching you from every nook and corner of existence. You will become fire with it, aflame!\n(And then to Prem Peter Osho said: )\nLove is the rock on which the temple of life can be built. Without love all houses are made on sands, shifting sands. One is bound to be disillusioned sooner or later, one is bound to be disappointed because the whole effort can collapse any moment. You don't have a real foundation to your house. It is more or less a house made of playing cards. It looks beautiful but just a little breeze and it collapses.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nMake your life rooted in love and then it never collapses. Love is the only experience that defies death, that knows no death. A man of love is unafraid of death because in knowing love he has known something of immortal existence. Tasting love he has tasted something of eternity and he knows that in him there is something which is going to persist. No death can destroy it, no fire can burn it. There is no possibility of its being erased from existence. The certainty is so deep, so self-evident, that it needs no other proof. You simply know it is so.\nBut the people who make their houses without the foundation of love are simply fools. Life will go on slipping out of their hands, and sooner or later death knocks on the door and they will not have any shelter against death. They will not know what to do. They will not know that something in them is going to survive so there is no need to fear.\nLove makes one fearless, and fearlessness is a great achievement. It means you have known something of deathlessness.\n(Love is virtue' was the meaning of her new name, Prem Sunito, Osho told a German student.) Lovelessness is the only vice, the only sin; all other sins arise out of it. They are simply branches, offshoots, leaves, foliage; the root is lovelessness. Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, Mao Tse Tung -- all these criminals are rooted in a state of lovelessness. They cannot love, they have become incapable of love.\nThe person who loves cannot harm; it is impossible to harm. How can you harm when you love? You cannot even imagine harming anybody. Love transforms your whole life; it gives you a new character. And the character is not imposed, it comes from your very innermost core. It is not like morality; morality is just superficial. Religiousness comes from within -- that is authentic virtue. First the centre becomes full of love, then the love starts spreading towards the circumference. That is your character. And when love glows in your acts they are virtuous.\nSo I teach you only love, not morality, because my observation is that if love is there one is moral automatically, inevitably. And if one is not loving then all morality is pseudo, bogus. It only creates hypocrites, it does not create real sages.\nLove cleanses you of all impurities -- anger, jealousy, hatred, possessiveness, domination. All trips and all numbers of the ego simply disappear just like dust disappears when you take a shower. Love is a shower of the spirit: it cleanses you. It makes you pure like a small child, innocent. And out of that innocence is beauty, out of that innocence is grace, and out of that innocence ultimately is the experience of god.\nWe have to be worthy to experience god. We have to create a right situation, only then can we invite him to come in. Even if an ordinary guest comes to your house you clean the house, you decorate the house, you arrange the furniture; you make everything give a sense of welcome so the guest feels at home, welcomed, loved. And when we invite god we have to prepare our own inner being because that is the place into which we can invite him.\nAnd love cleanses the inner world. Love is alchemical, it transforms your very chemistry. It makes you a new person, it gives you a new birth. One becomes twice-born through love.\nMy message contains only one single word: love. So if by becoming a sannyasin you become more loving, that's enough. Then everything will be taken care of.\nJesus says, \"Seek ye the kingdom of god and all else shall be added unto you.\" What he means by god is love. Read, \"Seek ye the kingdom of love and all else shall be added unto you.\"\n(To an artist from Canada Osho gave the name, Prem Gatha -- a story of love.)\nShakespeare says about life: A tale told by an idiot, full of fury and noise, signifying nothing. And he is right as far as ninety-nine point nine percent of people are concerned: their life is a tale told by an idiot; it makes no sense at all. The ordinary life of the majority makes no sense at all, it is utterly stupid. Somehow they go on and on dragging themselves, but it is not life because there is no dance. They are only dragging, they are vegetating -- it is not real life.\nReal life must have the quality of godliness, the fragrance of lore. Love has to become your inner story, then it is no more a tale told by an idiot. Then it is a tale told by a Buddha, full of dance and music! Then it releases the imprisoned splendour in you. And you have such a vast sky within, far more beautiful than the outer sky with all its stars and moon and sun. You have a far bigger sky within you, far more beautiful.\nRabiya, one of the Sufi mystics, was sitting in her small cottage, and a guest mystic, Hasan, was also staying with her. It was early morning and Hasan went out. It was a beautiful dawn and the sky was red and 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nthe birds were singing and the flowers opening and the trees swaying in the cool morning breeze. He was so thrilled that he called Rabiya, \"Rabiya, what are you doing inside? Come out! God has given us such a beautiful morning -- don't miss it!\"\nAnd Rabiya laughed. She was a very strange woman, of the same calibre as Christ and Buddha. Her laughter was so loud that Hasan felt a little shocked -- why was she laughing? He asked, \"Why are you laughing?\"\nShe said, \"Hasan, you come in -- because you are seeing a painting of god and I am seeing god himself!\nYes, the painting is beautiful, but who cares when you have found the painter himself? You come in, rather than calling me out!\"\nShe transformed a small, ordinary statement into a tremendously significant\nmessage. Hasan went in; he saw Rabiya -- she was sitting with closed eyes -- surrounded by such a beautiful aura. He fell at her feet and said, \"Forgive me! It was wrong on my part to call you out. I was not aware. I am not really a meditator,\" he said. \"I have learned much from the scriptures and people think that I am a great mystic, but I am only a scholar. Teach me the art of going in.\nAnd that's what sannyas is about, the art of coming in. And then the whole story changes. It is no more full of noise and fury. The same energy starts becoming a song, a tremendously beautiful music. The same energy that was sheer nonsense starts becoming a profound meaningfulness. And the same idiot is no more an idiot. All his idiocy is gone and his Buddhahood explodes. Each idiot is carrying a Buddha within his womb, and the Buddha has to be released.\nThe head is always a failure; it cannot be victorious. The heart is always victorious; it can never fail.\nLove never fails; logic always fails because logic is rooted in doubt. How can it succeed? Its very foundation is doubt. And love is rooted in trust. How can it fail? There is no possibility.\nIn fact, love has such a magical quality that you may fail in the eyes of the world but you are never a failure as far as you are concerned -- and that is the only thing to be considered. Logic may succeed in the eyes of the world -- it is cunning. It succeeds politically; it succeeds as far as prestige, power, money is concerned. But inside you know that you have failed. Your life is empty, there is no meaning in it.\nAnd doubt goes on creating darkness. Doubt is another name for darkness, and trust another name for light. And these are the two alternatives available for every person: the head and the heart. The whole humanity can be divided in two categories, the heads and the hearts. But we don't divine humanity that way, we divide humanity into hand\u0026 and heads. The labourer is called a hand and the boss is called the head. The person who works is a hand and the person who is cunning enough not to work is the head. But there is no category for the heart at all. This is a strange categorisation. The real division is between the heads and the hearts.\nBut I can understand why the heart has been ignored -- there are so few people who live in the heart.\nThey are negligible, they are exceptional, they can be ignored. They only prove the rule; they need not be counted. A Buddha, a Christ, a Krishna -- they need not be counted. We can ignore them; they don't consist of the vast humanity, they are not part of us. We have managed to cut them off from humanity. We call them avataras, teerthankaras, descendants of god, sons of gods, messengers of god, but not human beings.\nAnd they are really human beings -- nobody else is! But to save our ego, we say, \"We are human beings; they are far above us, transcendental. We can worship them, that's okay, but we cannot live according to them. That is impossible.\"\nI say to you, worship is stupid. Live like a Buddha -- that is the only true worship. Live like a Christ.\nAnd you have every potential to be a Christ or a Buddha; you are not less endowed. You have a heart, but it is not functioning. It is as if you have an air- conditioner in the room and it is not functioning, and you are perspiring and you are getting hot and you are freaking out! And it is just that you don't know how to put the conditioner on, and all these troubles will disappear.\nThe heart is there, a given fact, but it is absolutely non-functioning. We have forgotten how to put it on.\nWe have forgotten two things: we don't know how to put the head off and we don't know how to put the heart on. So the head goes on continuously, day in, day out, year in, year out. Even in the night when you are asleep it goes on chattering. It does not take any note of whether you are awake or asleep, whether you are alive or dead -- it does not bother!\nEven people in their graves must be thinking, still thinking, planning what they have to do tomorrow. I cannot imagine that they have stopped -- such a long habit! Habits don't die so easily. You can die, that's another matter, but the habits persist and many things continue. So I think the head must be continuing.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nNails go on growing in the grave and hair goes on growing -- old habits! So I think the head must continue dreaming, planning, imagining, having memories.\nWe have completely forgotten how to put it off. And the miracle is that the same switch which puts the head off, puts the heart on. The moment you put the head off, the heart goes on. There are not two switches!\nAnd this is the whole of meditation: to help you find the switch, so you can put the head off. And then immediately you will start having a different humming sound, a different functioning. A different dimension opens up.\nThe heart can make you victorious. The heart can make you a master of your own being. It can make you blissful, peaceful, divine.\n(Bliss is inside us, Osho reiterated in his last address, which was to an Indian ex- police inspector. Turn in, he told him, and you will discover a whole new perspective to life.) Then it is no more confined by birth and death. Then we know it has been before birth and it will be there after death too. Then birth and death are not the beginning and the end of life but only ordinary episodes in an eternal journey.\nPeople are sad and miserable for the simple reason that they have been searching outside. They cannot find it there because it is not there in the first place. You have to look in the right place. Our consciousness contains all, the whole kingdom of god is there. Man comes with all that he needs, with all that he desires.\nBut the problem is that he starts rushing here and there, hither and thither, all over the world, thinking that by gaining more money or becoming more powerful he will be blissful. He goes on and on wasting energy.\nThe moment when one starts looking in is the most important one in life; nothing is more important than that. And sannyas has to be that turning-point.\nMy whole effort here is to help you to look within. The moment it happens... and it can happen any moment; all that is needed is your cooperation with me. It cannot happen in a state of conflict. That's what sannyas is a cooperation with the master. The disciple simply becomes so attuned with the master that he starts\ntaking hints. He is no more in an argumentative mood, he argues no more. With the master there is no argument possible; one simply listens and follows. And things are so simple that if one can listen and follow it can happen immediately, instantly.\nSo be here for a few days and learn at least one meditation, Vipassana, and that will suit you.\nJust the Tip of the Iceberg Chapter #19\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"4646","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/just_the_tip_of_the_iceberg/part18/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/just_the_tip_of_the_iceberg/>Just The Tip Of The Iceberg</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>22 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;4646 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Just_The_Tip_Of_The_Iceberg/part18.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part17>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

Chuang Tzu Auditorium</h3><p>Archive code: 8009185 ShortTitle: ICEBRG18 Audio:</p><p>No Video:</p><p>No</p><p>[NOTE: This is an unedited tape transcript of an unpublished darshan
diary, which has been scanned and cleaned up. It is for reference
purposes only.]</p><p>(Osho began the evening by talking about bliss as a flowering of
aloneness.) Bliss means courage, nothing else. It is already there
inside, but to go inside is not for the cowards because the coward
always wants company, a crowd. He feels at ease with the crowd;
surrounded by people he feels secure. The coward is like a sheep. The
sheep is perfectly happy with the crowd; alone, great fear arises.</p><p>An inside journey is a journey towards absolute aloneness; you cannot
take anybody there with you.</p><p>You cannot share your centre with anybody, not even with your
beloved. It is not in the nature of things; nothing can be done about
it. It is easier to go to the moon because you can have company. Even if
you don't have company you can have a connection with the earth; you can
phone the people here. You can get directions from the outside, from the
far away earth, but still you are connected. The moment you go in, all
connections with the outside world are broken; all bridges are broken.
In fact, the whole world disappears.</p><p>That's why the mystics have called the world illusory, maya, not that
it does not exist but for the meditator, one who goes in, it is almost
as if it does not exist.</p><p>The silence is so profound; no noise penetrates it. The aloneness is
so deep that one needs guts. But out of that aloneness explodes bliss.
Out of that aloneness, the experience of god. There is no other way;
there has never been any and there is never going to be.</p><p>(Because John was the name of the most loved disciple of Jesus, the
name has that connotation, Osho explained to a Dutch analyst. And then
he described the three different kinds of people who seek truth.) One is
the student. His enquiry is mental, of the head, intellectual. He wants
to gather a little knowledge of what truth is all about; his enquiry is
superficial. The second category consists of disciples. Their enquiry is
of the heart, not of the head. They really want to know truth, not just
knowledge about truth; they want to experience it. They are not
satisfied with mere knowledge, they want an authentic experience. Hence
the disciple moves on a different plane from the student, the scholar.
The student collects information, the 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>disciple asks for transformation.</p><p>And the third category consists of the devotees. They are those to
whom the transformation has happened , who have come to experience, to
taste, who have found a glimpse of truth. The disciple is still seeking,
the devotee has arrived. That is the third category.</p><p>Only a disciple can become a devotee. The student cannot become a
devotee; first he will have to become a disciple. If the student remains
a student for his whole life he will be missing the whole point. He will
talk about truth, about love, about god, about meditation. But all
knowledge is borrowed, it is not his own experience. The disciple has a
little bit of experience because he moves from logic to love, from head
to heart. The heart is closer to being. The student is in the head, the
disciple in the heart, and the devotee reaches his very being. But
nobody can bypass disciplehood -- it is a must.</p><p>And the only thing that can make you really a disciple and ultimately
a devotee is meditation. One has to learn how to be silent, still, calm
and quiet. The</p><p>moment you know the art of being silent, the miracle starts
happening. You start becoming a beloved disciple, you are no more an
ordinary disciple. And when meditation is complete, entire, you are
transformed into a devotee. Then the whole world is divine. For a
devotee all is god; except for god, nothing exists.</p><p>That is the goal of sannyas. One <em>may</em> come here as a student,
but one should not go from here as a student. If one goes as a disciple
one has taken a great jump. And if you are a disciple then it is not
very difficult to be a devotee. The first gap is bigger -- from the
student to the disciple. The first change is very radical; the second
change is very gradual. It comes on its own, of its own accord; you need
not strive for it.</p><p>The disciple one day naturally becomes a devotee, but it is not so
with the student. The student may remain a student for his whole life.
The pundits, the scholars, the theologians, the professors, the
philosophers --</p><p>they remain only students.</p><p>Sannyas means disciplehood, and sannyas is fulfilled when you have
become a devotee. When the trees and the mountains and the sun and the
moon and the stars, all represent one reality, one god, you have come
home.</p><p>Pankaj means a lotus, and the lotus has always represented something
of tremendous value. Two things particularly have to be remembered. One:
the lotus grows out of mud -- the most beautiful flower grows out of
dirty mud. It means that the dirty mud contains something beautiful. So
don't reject the dirty mud, because it contains lotuses.</p><p>One has to know the art of how to grow lotuses. And it is a miracle,
one cannot believe it! If one has not seen a lotus growing out of mud
one cannot believe it; one cannot conceive that this beautiful flower,
this delicate flower, with such fragrance, with such colour, has come
out of ordinary mud.</p><p>Man is born as ordinary mud, but man contains a lotus -- just in the
seed. Man has not to be rejected, man has to be accepted and
transformed. The world has not to be denied, because it contains
something infinitely beautiful. It is not on the surface, it has to be
brought to the surface.</p><p>Hence I am not against anything: not against body, not against the
world, not against the outside. I am not against anything, but I am for
transforming</p><p>everything. Whatsoever god has given is something valuable; if we
cannot understand its value it is our fault, our limited vision.</p><p>The second thing to be remembered about the lotus is: it lives in the
water, but the water touches it not.</p><p>It has such velvety petals that even if dewdrops gather on those
petals they remain separate. That's why on a lotus petal the dewdrop
looks so beautiful, it looks like a pearl because the lotus remains
untouched.</p><p>That's why I say it precisely defines my vision of sannyas. A
sannyasin has to <em>live</em> in the world but has to remain untouched
like a lotus. I am not for renunciation, I don't teach escapism. I teach
live in the world but don't let the world enter you. Be in the world but
don't be of the world. Remain aloof, remain cool, remain untouched. And
then the world has much to teach you. The world is a device of god; it
is a situation in which to grow and mature. Those who escape remain
retarded.</p><p>I have come across many people in the Himalayas who have lived the
life of an escapist for their whole life, for thirty years, forty years,
fifty years. But they look retarded, they don't look intelligent; they
don't have the sharpness. Their sword has gathered rust because they
escaped from the challenges of life.</p><p>Live in life -- all those challenges are good. It is only through
those challenges that one grows. Growth comes through the hard way.
Never choose the easy way, otherwise you will remain immature. Never
choose the short-cut, otherwise you will miss many scenes and scenery on
the way. Live life in its totality, intensely but with awareness.
Awareness becomes like a velvety coating on you and keeps you separate
from the world. And that very art is sannyas.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>(The real Christian is Christ, Osho told a German psychologist.)
Friedrich Nietzsche has said that the first and the last Christian died
on the cross two</p><p>thousand years before -- the first and the last! And he is right. He
was a madman, but about many things his insight is far deeper than that
of your so-called pope!. Sometimes it happens that mad people have
greater insight than the so-called sane people because the so-called
sane are not really sane.</p><p>Christians are not really interested in Christ, neither are Buddhists
interested in Buddha, nor are the Hindus really interested in Krishna --
because it is not a question of worship. Christ is not Jesus' name, his
name is Jesus. He attained to a certain peak of consciousness. That peak
is known in the West as Christ- consciousness, in the East we call it
Buddha-consciousness. It is the same, it is the same peak. There are
different languages describing the same peak.</p><p>One can be a Christian only if one attains Christ-consciousness, and
that is possible through meditation.</p><p>Not by reading the Bible, not by going to the church, not by
following the Christian ritual, not by believing in a certain dogma and
creed, but by purifying your consciousness, dropping all that is
unnecessary, non-essential, so that only the essential remains in you.
The moment only the essential remains in you there is a great explosion
of light. And that experience makes one a Christ or a Buddha or a Jina
or a Krishna; it matters not what word is used.</p><p>Never be bothered with words. Remember the meaning and forget the
words.</p><p>A man without love is like a flower without fragrance. A flower
without fragrance is not of much value.</p><p>A man without love is also not of any value at all. A man without
love is an empty temple -- god is missing.</p><p>Jesus says god is love. I say love is god, I make love far more
important than god, because when love comes god automatically happens.
So one can ignore god but one cannot ignore love. Love is the very
bridge. And by love I don't mean the love that is known ordinarily --
that is lust, it is not love. It is desire, it is not love. It is
exploitation of the other as a means, it is not love.</p><p>Love knows no lust; it is not a desire. Love is never a beggar. Love
gives and never asks for any return.</p><p>Love gives for the sheer joy of giving. Love shares one's bliss,
because one</p><p>comes to know slowly slowly that the more you share it, the more it
happens. The more you give, the more you have.</p><p>So it is not a question of whom to love, it is a question of being in
a state of love, unaddressed, to whomsoever it may concern. No need even
to put the name on it. Love addressed to a particular person becomes
limited, narrow. And a narrow love is not real love; it becomes
crippled. Love is so vast, you cannot narrow it down.</p><p>It is as stupid as somebody deciding "Because I love you, I will
breathe only in your presence. So when you are not there I will not
breathe."</p><p>Then the next time will never happen, the next meeting is impossible,
because that man will be dead!</p><p>Even when the lover is not there or the beloved is not there, one has
to breathe. Love should be like breathing. It should not be a
relationship but like breathing -</p><p>- natural. So whosoever comes to you, your love is there just is as
your breathing</p><p>is there. If you pass by the side of a tree, your love showers on the
tree. You say hello to the tree -- you can even shake hands! And when
you sit on a rock, of course you enquire "How are you?"</p><p>A lover is continuously in a state of love -- that's what I mean by
love. Then it takes you by and by towards god. The ultimate peak of love
is god. God is not a person, it is the ultimate fragrance of love, a
living fragrance.</p><p>I like to use the word "godliness" rather than "god", because god
gives you a sense of a person.</p><p>Godliness is far better because it gives you only a sense of
fragrance -- a presence not a person.</p><p>Love, and love unconditionally. Love, and love without asking for any
return. Love as an end unto itself, and that is true prayer. And love
the whole existence without any discrimination, without any choice. Love
choicelessly, and then the day is not far away when you will become
aware of godliness surrounding you, reaching you from every nook and
corner of existence. You will become fire with it, aflame!</p><p>(And then to Prem Peter Osho said: )</p><p>Love is the rock on which the temple of life can be built. Without
love all houses are made on sands, shifting sands. One is bound to be
disillusioned sooner or later, one is bound to be disappointed because
the whole effort can collapse any moment. You don't have a real
foundation to your house. It is more or less a house made of playing
cards. It looks beautiful but just a little breeze and it collapses.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>Make your life rooted in love and then it never collapses. Love is
the only experience that defies death, that knows no death. A man of
love is unafraid of death because in knowing love he has known something
of immortal existence. Tasting love he has tasted something of eternity
and he knows that in him there is something which is going to persist.
No death can destroy it, no fire can burn it. There is no possibility of
its being erased from existence. The certainty is so deep, so
self-evident, that it needs no other proof. You simply know it is
so.</p><p>But the people who make their houses without the foundation of love
are simply fools. Life will go on slipping out of their hands, and
sooner or later death knocks on the door and they will not have any
shelter against death. They will not know what to do. They will not know
that something in them is going to survive so there is no need to
fear.</p><p>Love makes one fearless, and fearlessness is a great achievement. It
means you have known something of deathlessness.</p><p>(Love is virtue' was the meaning of her new name, Prem Sunito, Osho
told a German student.) Lovelessness is the only vice, the only sin; all
other sins arise out of it. They are simply branches, offshoots, leaves,
foliage; the root is lovelessness. Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, Mao Tse
Tung -- all these criminals are rooted in a state of lovelessness. They
cannot love, they have become incapable of love.</p><p>The person who loves cannot harm; it is impossible to harm. How can
you harm when you love? You cannot even imagine harming anybody. Love
transforms your whole life; it gives you a new character. And the
character is not imposed, it comes from your very innermost core. It is
not like morality; morality is just superficial. Religiousness comes
from within -- that is authentic virtue. First the centre becomes full
of love, then the love starts spreading towards the circumference. That
is your character. And when love glows in your acts they are
virtuous.</p><p>So I teach you only love, not morality, because my observation is
that if love is there one is moral automatically, inevitably. And if one
is not loving then all morality is pseudo, bogus. It only creates
hypocrites, it does not create real sages.</p><p>Love cleanses you of all impurities -- anger, jealousy, hatred,
possessiveness, domination. All trips and all numbers of the ego simply
disappear just like dust disappears when you take a shower. Love is a
shower of the spirit: it cleanses you. It makes you pure like a small
child, innocent. And out of that innocence is beauty, out of that
innocence is grace, and out of that innocence ultimately is the
experience of god.</p><p>We have to be worthy to experience god. We have to create a right
situation, only then can we invite him to come in. Even if an ordinary
guest comes to your house you clean the house, you decorate the house,
you arrange the furniture; you make everything give a sense of welcome
so the guest feels at home, welcomed, loved. And when we invite god we
have to prepare our own inner being because that is the place into which
we can invite him.</p><p>And love cleanses the inner world. Love is alchemical, it transforms
your very chemistry. It makes you a new person, it gives you a new
birth. One becomes twice-born through love.</p><p>My message contains only one single word: love. So if by becoming a
sannyasin you become more loving, that's enough. Then everything will be
taken care of.</p><p>Jesus says, "Seek ye the kingdom of god and all else shall be added
unto you." What he means by god is love. Read, "Seek ye the kingdom of
love and all else shall be added unto you."</p><p>(To an artist from Canada Osho gave the name, Prem Gatha -- a story
of love.)</p><p>Shakespeare says about life: A tale told by an idiot, full of fury
and noise, signifying nothing. And he is right as far as ninety-nine
point nine percent of people are concerned: their life is a tale told by
an idiot; it makes no sense at all. The ordinary life of the majority
makes no sense at all, it is utterly stupid. Somehow they go on and on
dragging themselves, but it is not life because there is no dance. They
are only dragging, they are vegetating -- it is not real life.</p><p>Real life must have the quality of godliness, the fragrance of lore.
Love has to become your inner story, then it is no more a tale told by
an idiot. Then it is a tale told by a Buddha, full of dance and music!
Then it releases the imprisoned splendour in you. And you have such a
vast sky within, far more beautiful than the outer sky with all its
stars and moon and sun. You have a far bigger sky within you, far more
beautiful.</p><p>Rabiya, one of the Sufi mystics, was sitting in her small cottage,
and a guest mystic, Hasan, was also staying with her. It was early
morning and Hasan went out. It was a beautiful dawn and the sky was red
and 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>the birds were singing and the flowers opening and the trees swaying
in the cool morning breeze. He was so thrilled that he called Rabiya,
"Rabiya, what are you doing inside? Come out! God has given us such a
beautiful morning -- don't miss it!"</p><p>And Rabiya laughed. She was a very strange woman, of the same calibre
as Christ and Buddha. Her laughter was so loud that Hasan felt a little
shocked -- why was she laughing? He asked, "Why are you laughing?"</p><p>She said, "Hasan, <em>you</em> come in -- because you are seeing a
painting of god and I am seeing god himself!</p><p>Yes, the painting is beautiful, but who cares when you have found the
painter himself? <em>You</em> come in, rather than calling me out!"</p><p>She transformed a small, ordinary statement into a tremendously
significant</p><p>message. Hasan went in; he saw Rabiya -- she was sitting with closed
eyes -- surrounded by such a beautiful aura. He fell at her feet and
said, "Forgive me! It was wrong on my part to call you out. I was not
aware. I am not really a meditator," he said. "I have learned much from
the scriptures and people think that I am a great mystic, but I am only
a scholar. Teach me the art of going in.</p><p>And that's what sannyas is about, the art of coming in. And then the
whole story changes. It is no more full of noise and fury. The same
energy starts becoming a song, a tremendously beautiful music. The same
energy that was sheer nonsense starts becoming a profound
meaningfulness. And the same idiot is no more an idiot. All his idiocy
is gone and his Buddhahood explodes. Each idiot is carrying a Buddha
within his womb, and the Buddha has to be released.</p><p>The head is always a failure; it cannot be victorious. The heart is
always victorious; it can never fail.</p><p>Love never fails; logic always fails because logic is rooted in
doubt. How can it succeed? Its very foundation is doubt. And love is
rooted in trust. How can it fail? There is no possibility.</p><p>In fact, love has such a magical quality that you may fail in the
eyes of the world but you are never a failure as far as you are
concerned -- and that is the only thing to be considered. Logic may
succeed in the eyes of the world -- it is cunning. It succeeds
politically; it succeeds as far as prestige, power, money is concerned.
But inside you know that you have failed. Your life is empty, there is
no meaning in it.</p><p>And doubt goes on creating darkness. Doubt is another name for
darkness, and trust another name for light. And these are the two
alternatives available for every person: the head and the heart. The
whole humanity can be divided in two categories, the heads and the
hearts. But we don't divine humanity that way, we divide humanity into
hand& and heads. The labourer is called a hand and the boss is
called the head. The person who works is a hand and the person who is
cunning enough not to work is the head. But there is no category for the
heart at all. This is a strange categorisation. The real division is
between the heads and the hearts.</p><p>But I can understand why the heart has been ignored -- there are so
few people who live in the heart.</p><p>They are negligible, they are exceptional, they can be ignored. They
only prove the rule; they need not be counted. A Buddha, a Christ, a
Krishna -- they need not be counted. We can ignore them; they don't
consist of the vast humanity, they are not part of us. We have managed
to cut them off from humanity. We call them avataras, teerthankaras,
descendants of god, sons of gods, messengers of god, but not human
beings.</p><p>And they are <em>really</em> human beings -- nobody else is! But to
save our ego, we say, "We are human beings; they are far above us,
transcendental. We can worship them, that's okay, but we cannot live
according to them. That is impossible."</p><p>I say to you, worship is stupid. <em>Live</em> like a Buddha -- that
is the only true worship. Live like a Christ.</p><p>And you have every potential to be a Christ or a Buddha; you are not
less endowed. You have a heart, but it is not functioning. It is as if
you have an air- conditioner in the room and it is not functioning, and
you are perspiring and you are getting hot and you are freaking out! And
it is just that you don't know how to put the conditioner on, and all
these troubles will disappear.</p><p>The heart <em>is</em> there, a given fact, but it is absolutely
non-functioning. We have forgotten how to put it on.</p><p>We have forgotten two things: we don't know how to put the head off
and we don't know how to put the heart on. So the head goes on
continuously, day in, day out, year in, year out. Even in the night when
you are asleep it goes on chattering. It does not take any note of
whether you are awake or asleep, whether you are alive or dead -- it
does not bother!</p><p>Even people in their graves must be thinking, still thinking,
planning what they have to do tomorrow. I cannot imagine that they have
stopped -- such a long habit! Habits don't die so easily. <em>You</em>
can die, that's another matter, but the habits persist and many things
continue. So I think the head must be continuing.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-4>Osho's books on

habits! So I think the head must continue dreaming, planning, imagining,
having memories.</p><p>We have completely forgotten how to put it off. And the miracle is
that the same switch which puts the head off, puts the heart on. The
moment you put the head off, the heart goes on. There are not two
switches!</p><p>And this is the whole of meditation: to help you find the switch, so
you can put the head off. And then immediately you will start having a
different humming sound, a different functioning. A different dimension
opens up.</p><p>The heart can make you victorious. The heart can make you a master of
your own being. It can make you blissful, peaceful, divine.</p><p>(Bliss is inside us, Osho reiterated in his last address, which was
to an Indian ex- police inspector. Turn in, he told him, and you will
discover a whole new perspective to life.) Then it is no more confined
by birth and death. Then we know it has been before birth and it will be
there after death too. Then birth and death are not the beginning and
the end of life but only ordinary episodes in an eternal journey.</p><p>People are sad and miserable for the simple reason that they have
been searching outside. They cannot find it there because it is not
there in the first place. You have to look in the right place. Our
consciousness contains all, the whole kingdom of god is there. Man comes
with all that he needs, with all that he desires.</p><p>But the problem is that he starts rushing here and there, hither and
thither, all over the world, thinking that by gaining more money or
becoming more powerful he will be blissful. He goes on and on wasting
energy.</p><p>The moment when one starts looking in is the most important one in
life; nothing is more important than that. And sannyas has to be that
turning-point.</p><p>My whole effort here is to help you to look within. The moment it
happens... and it can happen any moment; all that is needed is your
cooperation with me. It cannot happen in a state of conflict. That's
what sannyas is a cooperation with the master. The disciple simply
becomes so attuned with the master that he starts</p><p>taking hints. He is no more in an argumentative mood, he argues no
more. With the master there is no argument possible; one simply listens
and follows. And things are so simple that if one can listen and follow
it can happen immediately, instantly.</p><p>So be here for a few days and learn at least one meditation,
Vipassana, and that will suit you.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:justify id=just-the-tip-of-the-iceberg>Just the Tip of the Iceberg</h3><p>Chapter #19</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part17>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

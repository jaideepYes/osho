Hence all the so-called prayers are disturbances. When you start saying something to god you miss the whole point.\nTo me prayer means to be in a prayerful mood, a loving mood. But nothing has to be said. One has to be simply open, open to existence, to the trees, to the sun, to the wind, to the rain, to the stars. When one is open and silent it is prayer.\nHence prayer cannot be Christian, Hindu or Mohammedan; prayer is simply prayer, because it is silence.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nIf you say something then it can be Christian or Hindu or Jewish. But if you don't say anything, if you are simply full of gratitude towards existence, no word crosses your mind, that is prayer, authentic prayer.\nWithout meditation there is no prayer. Prayer is the fragrance of meditation, the song of silence. Nothing is said but everything is heard. If you say something, god cannot hear it; if you don't say it, it is heard. One has to understand this paradox, only then can one understand prayer.\n(Love is an overflow of bliss.)\nA miserable person cannot be but unloving. It is not a question of your intentions. Even the miserable person wants to be loving, but it is impossible; just wanting it is not going to help. It is impossible in a state of misery because one is closed, one is shrinking and dying within, and love needs flowing, opening. And love is possible only when you have something to give.\nThe miserable person has nothing to give. In fact, he continuously demands \"Give me this, give me that.\" He pretends to show love, but the reality is that he wants to be loved. And the other party may be in the same situation, hence two beggars are asking from each other \"Give me something\" -- and both have empty bowls! Naturally there is going to be conflict, misery, fight. Lovers are continuously fighting for the simple reason that everybody wants the other to love and nobody is ready to love.\nI teach bliss, and then love comes inevitably. When you are overflowing with bliss you have to share it.\nIt has an intrinsic need to share, just as a cloud full of rainwater has to shower or when a flower opens it has to release its fragrance.\nLove is the release of your grace, of your beauty, of your splendour. Every man is an imprisoned splendour -- and misery is the prison. It is only a question of understanding and misery disappears. It is our choice whether to be miserable or to be blissful. In a single moment of understanding one can drop all misery. It is not a question of gradual growth, it can be dropped suddenly. And whenever it is dropped it is dropped suddenly. My whole effort here is to make you aware and understanding so that you can see it is you who are creating your misery by choosing it. Once you have accepted the total responsibility for being miserable then it is just a question of not creating it anymore, and the same energy\nbecomes bliss. And the moment you are blissful, life is love. When life is love it is religious, it is divine.\n(Real freedom is a state of mind, or rather, mindlessness, was the gist of the message for Dhyan Svatantro.)\nMeditation is a means; freedom is the goal, the ultimate goal. But without meditation nobody can attain to freedom. I am not talking about political freedom, I am talking about spiritual freedom.\nMan has tried in thousands of ways to change the outer structure of the society, to change the state, the economy. We have tried all kinds of economies, Capitalist, communist, socialist, fascist -- we have tried all kinds of political ideologies. And all have failed, without any exception, for the simple reason that if man remains inwardly a slave you cannot make him free from the outside that is impossible. We will again create a new kind of bondage, he will move from one prison to another prison. But he cannot live without chains; he has become accustomed to chains. And the root cause is within him.\nMeditation simply destroys the root cause of all slavery. Meditation simply means a state of no-mind.\nMind means all that society has given to you. It is not yours, mind is something borrowed. It is basically planted in you by the society, by the politicians, by the priests, by the pedagogues. The whole educational system exists just to condition the child in a particular pattern, to give him a certain gestalt, to imprison him, to make him a Christian or a Hindu or a Mohammedan or a communist -- but to make SOMEthing out of him, not to allow him to be himself but to impose a certain structure.\nNobody wants anybody to be himself. Parents have their ideas about how their children should be; they impose their ambitions, their ideologies. Society is very much afraid of free people. It wants to cripple everybody's consciousness, because slaves are obedient. Slaves are not dangerous because they cannot be rebels.\nSo your mind is basically against you. Never thing of it as yours. It serves the society, it serves the state, it serves the church; it is not in your service. It is a very cunning device.\nMeditation means to put the mind aside so that the whole imposed world of conditionings is put aside.\nWhen you are not a Christian, nor a Hindu, you are neither an American nor a German nor a Chinese nor an Indian. All nations are put aside, all races are put aside. For the first time you are simply a human being with no label. And the beauty of that is immense and the ecstasy of it is immeasurable. Suddenly you find yourself expanding. Even the sky is not the limit! You become vast. Meditation opens doors for you, doors 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nof infinity, of eternity. You go above time and space.\nThe moment you drop the mind you become part of god -- and by \"god\" I don't mean any person. God is not a person at all -- god is a presence, not a person. God simply means a quality, a certain godliness that surrounds the whole existence, a certain sacredness, a purity, a fragrance.\nThe moment you put the mind aside, the barrier between you and the whole is no more there, the wall between you and the whole is no more there. Suddenly a meeting, a merger, a communion, happens. And that communion brings freedom\n-- freedom from the body, freedom from the mind. You are simply pure consciousness. It brings freedom from birth and freedom from death too. Suddenly you become aware that you were before birth happened and you will be there even after death. The house, the body, is just a temporary abode. You have lived in many bodies and you have lived in many minds. Those minds, those bodies are all gone, but you remain. You are the only abiding factor in existence.\nThis consciousness is timeless, beginningless, endless. And it brings many kinds of freedom, a multi-dimensional freedom. It brings freedom from death, and naturally, the moment you are free from death, the moment you know you are immortal, as immortal as the whole existence, all fears disappear.\nFreedom from death means freedom from fear. And when there is no fear there\nis love -- there is love only when there is no fear.\nThe person who is full of fear, how can he love? And the person who is full of fear, he cannot enquire into truth. All that he wants is to be consoled so that he can repress his fears.\nThe people who are in the churches, in the temples, in the mosques, are all afraid\n-- cowards. They are simply there out of fear. They are afraid of hell, they are afraid they may lose heaven; they are afraid of a thousand and one things. They are constantly trembling inside. This is a very ill state of affairs.\nMy sannyasins have to go beyond all this. They have to drop the mind, and with it all the beliefs and all the knowledge that others have given to you, because it is not true. Truth is always yours, your experience, authentically your experience. It cannot be given by somebody to you. I cannot give it to you. My truth -- I cannot give it to you -- will remain mine. I can only help you to find your truth. I can simply give you a few hints, a few guidelines. Then you have to follow those guidelines in the inner world. It is inward exploration. I don't give you any belief, any dogma, any creed. I simply give you a few methods which can help you to go inwards.\nThe moment you have reached your own centre you know what is, you know that which is. In that very moment you are free, and freedom brings love, bliss, truth, god. Freedom brings all the ecstasies that one has been longing for for thousands of lives. All frustrations disappear. Life becomes a blessing. And not only are you blissful, you also become a blessing to the whole existence.\nA blessed person is always a blessing to all. His very presence is enough to enhance other people's joy.\nHe triggers in other people's hearts blocked sources of energy. Just being in contact with a man who is blissful is enough, and your heart will start singing a song; some bell suddenly starts ringing inside you.\nThere is a synchronicity, and immediately a transmutation starts happening.\nThat's what the meaning of sannyas is: being with a master in deep attunement, being with a master with deep love and trust so that you can gather courage to put the mind aside. It is the greatest courage in life, but if once, even for a single moment, you can put the mind aside, you will have a glimpse of the ultimate.\nAnd then there is no trouble: you can put the mind aside whenever you want. The first experience is very definitive, very decisive, but the first experience needs courage; it needs courage to risk.\nSannyas is a risk. It is moving in danger, moving in insecurity -- but life grows only in insecurity. Only gamblers know the depth of life, only drunkards know the heights of life. The cowards just go on clinging to their miseries -- they cannot know anything of value.\n(Love is an alchemy that only works with the catalyst of egolessness, Osho told Prem Parivartan.) Ego is like a rock and love is like a roseflower, and if you put a rock on the roseflower obviously the roseflower will be crushed and will die. You have to put the rock aside.\nPeople have chosen egos because we have been brought up in such a stupid way that the whole effort is to create an ego in the child. It is created through ambition. Ambition is fuel, food for ego, and we try to force every child to become ambitious. And once the child becomes ambitious he loses track of his heart; then he is hung up in the head o.. because the heart is absolutely non- ambitious. The head is ambitious; it is always on an ego trip. It always wants to be first, to be foremost. It wants to be the president, the prime minister, this and that. It is always desiring more and more, and it never leaves any energy for you to live, to love, to rejoice. It destroys your heart. Your heart is a delicate phenomenon, like a roseflower.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nMy approach is: see clearly and choose the rose, and forget all about ambition. By becoming a sannyasin this change has to happen -- only then are you truly a sannyasin -- that you move your whole energy from ambition, from the head, and allow your heart to grow. And then thousands of flowers grow.\nSuddenly the spring comes to your being. Then one knows what contentment is \u0026nd one knows what sharing is, and one feels grateful to god for giving us such\na beautiful life and such a tremendously ecstatic existence.\nBut without love one simply drags. Love brings dance to your being, it brings celebration.\nMy sannyasins are not to be like the old stupid so-called saints -- sad and serious and ugly, with long faces. And you can see on their noses, their egos. They are holier-than-thou, always condemning others.\nI want sannyasins to be lovers, dancers, singers, poets, sculptors, painters -- creative, enjoying creativity, living moment to moment with total abandonment, with deep surrender to existence. Then all the beauties of life are yours, the very kingdom of god is yours.\nThere is no need to live in misery. One can go on from one peak to higher peaks, from one perfection to another perfection of bliss. There is no end to it -- it is an unending pilgrimage.\n(Life's a laugh, Osho told a Japanese sannyasin.)\nLife has to be taken non-seriously. It has to be taken joyfully, it has to be taken playfully, and only then will you be able to know what it is. The serious person is dull, dead. The serious person can think about what life is but he will never know.\nOne has to become like a small child again, full of wonder and awe and rejoicing in small things. Watch a child collecting seashells on the beach, coloured stones, with such joy, as if he has found diamonds. Look at the glee, the fun, the laughter, of the child! Running after butterflies or collecting wild flowers he is so totally in it that there is no past, no future for him.\nJesus says again and again: Unless you are like a small child you shall not enter into my kingdom of god. What he really means is to take life playfully e a child. Rejoice in small things. It is a gift of god to be rejoiced! It is not a problem to be solved, it is a mystery to be lived. The serious person makes a problem out of it and then he gets into trouble because it is not a problem in the first place. Hence no solution is going to be a solution; each solution will bring more problems.\nThe whole history of philosophy is proof for it. Each philosopher has given more problems to the world and he has not been able to solve a single problem\nbecause the fundamental approach is wrong. Life is not a riddle or a problem, it is a mystery. It cannot be de-mystified, hence there can e no solution ever.\nThe poets are closer to life than the philosophers, the musicians are closer to life than the mathematicians. The dancers are even closer because in a real dance the dancer disappears. He himself becomes part of the mystery. He loses his ego, and with the ego all seriousness is lost.\nI teach dance, I teach music, I teach poetry, because these are the pillars of the temple of celebration.\nJust the Tip of the Iceberg Chapter #26\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2671","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/just_the_tip_of_the_iceberg/part25/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/just_the_tip_of_the_iceberg/>Just The Tip Of The Iceberg</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>13 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2671 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Just_The_Tip_Of_The_Iceberg/part25.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part24>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

ideologies. Society is very much afraid of free people. It wants to
cripple everybody's consciousness, because slaves are obedient. Slaves
are not dangerous because they cannot be rebels.</p><p>So your mind is basically <em>against</em> you. Never thing of it as
yours. It serves the society, it serves the state, it serves the church;
it is not in your service. It is a very cunning device.</p><p>Meditation means to put the mind aside so that the whole imposed
world of conditionings is put aside.</p><p>When you are not a Christian, nor a Hindu, you are neither an
American nor a German nor a Chinese nor an Indian. All nations are put
aside, all races are put aside. For the first time you are simply a
human being with no label. And the beauty of that is immense and the
ecstasy of it is immeasurable. Suddenly you find yourself expanding.
Even the sky is not the limit! You become vast. Meditation opens doors

don't mean any person. God is not a person at all -- god is a presence,
not a person. God simply means a quality, a certain godliness that
surrounds the whole existence, a certain sacredness, a purity, a
fragrance.</p><p>The moment you put the mind aside, the barrier between you and the
whole is no more there, the wall between you and the whole is no more
there. Suddenly a meeting, a merger, a communion, happens. And that
communion brings freedom</p><p>-- freedom from the body, freedom from the mind. You are simply pure
consciousness. It brings freedom from birth and freedom from death too.
Suddenly you become aware that you were before birth happened and you
will be there even after death. The house, the body, is just a temporary
abode. You have lived in many bodies and you have lived in many minds.
Those minds, those bodies are all gone, but you remain. You are the only
abiding factor in existence.</p><p>This consciousness is timeless, beginningless, endless. And it brings
many kinds of freedom, a multi-dimensional freedom. It brings freedom
from death, and naturally, the moment you are free from death, the
moment you know you are immortal, as immortal as the whole existence,
all fears disappear.</p><p>Freedom from death means freedom from fear. And when there is no fear
there</p><p>is love -- there is love only when there is no fear.</p><p>The person who is full of fear, how can he love? And the person who
is full of fear, he cannot enquire into truth. All that he wants is to
be consoled so that he can repress his fears.</p><p>The people who are in the churches, in the temples, in the mosques,
are all afraid</p><p>-- cowards. They are simply there out of fear. They are afraid of
hell, they are afraid they may lose heaven; they are afraid of a
thousand and one things. They are constantly trembling inside. This is a
very ill state of affairs.</p><p>My sannyasins have to go beyond all this. They have to drop the mind,
and with it all the beliefs and all the knowledge that others have given
to you, because it is not true. Truth is always yours, your experience,
authentically your experience. It cannot be given by somebody to you. I
cannot give it to you. My truth -- I cannot give it to you -- will
remain mine. I can only help you to find your truth. I can simply give
you a few hints, a few guidelines. Then you have to follow those
guidelines in the inner world. It is inward exploration. I don't give
you any belief, any dogma, any creed. I simply give you a few methods
which can help you to go inwards.</p><p>The moment you have reached your own centre you know what is, you
know that which is. In that very moment you are free, and freedom brings
love, bliss, truth, god. Freedom brings all the ecstasies that one has
been longing for for thousands of lives. All frustrations disappear.
Life becomes a blessing. And not only are you blissful, you also become
a blessing to the whole existence.</p><p>A blessed person is always a blessing to all. His very presence is
enough to enhance other people's joy.</p><p>He triggers in other people's hearts blocked sources of energy. Just
being in contact with a man who is blissful is enough, and your heart
will start singing a song; some bell suddenly starts ringing inside
you.</p><p>There is a synchronicity, and immediately a transmutation starts
happening.</p><p>That's what the meaning of sannyas is: being with a master in deep
attunement, being with a master with deep love and trust so that you can
gather courage to put the mind aside. It is the greatest courage in
life, but if once, even for a single moment, you can put the mind aside,
you will have a glimpse of the ultimate.</p><p>And then there is no trouble: you can put the mind aside whenever you
want. The first experience is very definitive, very decisive, but the
first experience needs courage; it needs courage to risk.</p><p>Sannyas is a risk. It is moving in danger, moving in insecurity --
but life grows only in insecurity. Only gamblers know the depth of life,
only drunkards know the heights of life. The cowards just go on clinging
to their miseries -- they cannot know anything of value.</p><p>(Love is an alchemy that only works with the catalyst of egolessness,
Osho told Prem Parivartan.) Ego is like a rock and love is like a
roseflower, and if you put a rock on the roseflower obviously the
roseflower will be crushed and will die. You have to put the rock
aside.</p><p>People have chosen egos because we have been brought up in such a
stupid way that the whole effort is to create an ego in the child. It is
created through ambition. Ambition is fuel, food for ego, and we try to
force every child to become ambitious. And once the child becomes
ambitious he loses track of his heart; then he is hung up in the head
o.. because the heart is absolutely non- ambitious. The head is
ambitious; it is always on an ego trip. It always wants to be first, to
be foremost. It wants to be the president, the prime minister, this and
that. It is always desiring more and more, and it never leaves any
energy for you to live, to love, to rejoice. It destroys your heart.
Your heart is a delicate phenomenon, like a roseflower.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>My approach is: see clearly and choose the rose, and forget all about
ambition. By becoming a sannyasin this change has to happen -- only then
are you truly a sannyasin -- that you move your whole energy from
ambition, from the head, and allow your heart to grow. And then
thousands of flowers grow.</p><p>Suddenly the spring comes to your being. Then one knows what
contentment is &amp;nd one knows what sharing is, and one feels grateful
to god for giving us such</p><p>a beautiful life and such a tremendously ecstatic existence.</p><p>But without love one simply drags. Love brings dance to your being,
it brings celebration.</p><p>My sannyasins are not to be like the old stupid so-called saints --
sad and serious and ugly, with long faces. And you can see on their
noses, their egos. They are holier-than-thou, always condemning
others.</p><p>I want sannyasins to be lovers, dancers, singers, poets, sculptors,
painters -- creative, enjoying creativity, living moment to moment with
total abandonment, with deep surrender to existence. Then all the
beauties of life are yours, the very kingdom of god is yours.</p><p>There is no need to live in misery. One can go on from one peak to
higher peaks, from one perfection to another perfection of bliss. There
is no end to it -- it is an unending pilgrimage.</p><p>(Life's a laugh, Osho told a Japanese sannyasin.)</p><p>Life has to be taken non-seriously. It has to be taken joyfully, it
has to be taken playfully, and only then will you be able to know what
it is. The serious person is dull, dead. The serious person can think
about what life is but he will never know.</p><p>One has to become like a small child again, full of wonder and awe
and rejoicing in small things. Watch a child collecting seashells on the
beach, coloured stones, with such joy, as if he has found diamonds. Look
at the glee, the fun, the laughter, of the child! Running after
butterflies or collecting wild flowers he is so totally in it that there
is no past, no future for him.</p><p>Jesus says again and again: Unless you are like a small child you
shall not enter into my kingdom of god. What he really means is to take
life playfully e a child. Rejoice in small things. It is a gift of god
to be rejoiced! It is not a problem to be solved, it is a mystery to be
lived. The serious person makes a problem out of it and then he gets
into trouble because it is not a problem in the first place. Hence no
solution is going to be a solution; each solution will bring more
problems.</p><p>The whole history of philosophy is proof for it. Each philosopher has
given more problems to the world and he has not been able to solve a
single problem</p><p>because the fundamental approach is wrong. Life is not a riddle or a
problem, it is a mystery. It cannot be de-mystified, hence there can e
no solution ever.</p><p>The poets are closer to life than the philosophers, the musicians are
closer to life than the mathematicians. The dancers are even closer
because in a real dance the dancer disappears. He himself becomes part
of the mystery. He loses his ego, and with the ego all seriousness is
lost.</p><p>I teach dance, I teach music, I teach poetry, because these are the
pillars of the temple of celebration.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:justify id=just-the-tip-of-the-iceberg>Just the Tip of the Iceberg</h3><p>Chapter #26</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part24>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

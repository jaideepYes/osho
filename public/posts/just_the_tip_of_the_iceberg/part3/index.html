It is for reference purposes only.]\n(Prem Sabine. Sabine was the name of a now extinct Italian tribe, he told us.) Love is one of the languages which has been forgotten completely. The primitive people were more loving. As civilisation has grown love has disappeared. Sabine simply means a woman from the tribe which has disappeared, which is no more. Love also has disappeared in the same way. Now man exists like a desert; hence there is so much sadness in the world, so much seriousness, so much burden. Everybody is carrying a load of rocks on their hearts.\nDeath seems to be a relief to many people, hence so many people commit suicide. Life must have lost all meaning. And those who don't commit suicide are not necessarily alive; they may just be afraid of death, of the unknown. They may simply be cowards.\nSo people who commit suicide are utterly sad, obviously, so sad that they don't want to exist a single moment more. And those who do exist, at the most they survive, they don't live -- because without love there is no life. One can survive but survival is not enough. There is no dance in it, no poetry in it, no celebration in it.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nLove is the suprememost value. Think of love as god, as the only god, and make every effort to live according to love. Never allow anything that distracts you from love, because anything that distracts you from love distracts you from life too and from god too. They are all synonymous.\nD.H. Lawrence used to say that it would be good if for one hundred years we closed all the schools, colleges, universities, so that man can again become a little primitive, a little less civilised, a little less sophisticated, a little less cultured.\nThere is great insight in it. Of course it cannot be done, but something else can be done, and that's what I am trying to do. Let the universities continue and let civilisation continue -- they cannot be stopped, it is not possible to stop them -- but we can persuade individuals to jump out of this garbage. And if a vast number of people in the world start living the life of love then others will automatically be attracted to it It is bound to happen, because every man whose heart becomes full of love becomes a magnet. He becomes an energy field, and whosoever comes in contact with such a person is bound to be affected by it. Love is infectious.\nSo live love and spread love. That's my message to the sannyasins.\nIf you are courageous you can be blissful, if you are not courageous you are bound to remain miserable.\nMisery simply shows that the person is a coward, because the coward cannot drop anything. Even though he is miserable, even though it is misery, he clings. Whatsoever is there he clings to it. He is unable to renounce anything. He knows it hurts but he is more afraid of the unknown than the known, which is giving him fear, which is giving him misery, which is giving his all kinds of anguishes, anxieties.\nAt least one comfort is there, it is known. And he goes on clinging to it. He only says that he wants to be blissful but he does nothing because he cannot take the\nbasic step. The basic step is to drop misery --\nbecause misery is not clinging to anybody, it is we who cling to it.\nSo a really courageous person can drop it instantly, not even gradually, because that too shows cowardliness. That shows that, we will drop it slowly slowly so that we can become accustomed to the unknown first; as it becomes more familiar we can drop a little bit more. But then it can take lives! And even then he will not be transformed.\nTransformation needs a discontinuity; not a gradual change but a jump, a quantum leap from the known into the unknown. It needs the heart of a gambler.\nSo be courageous and drop all that creates misery in you. And drop it immediately, don't postpone it for tomorrow The coward always postpones. The courageous does it immediately; once he sees the point he is ready to do it whatsoever the risk, whatsoever the cost.\nThe cowardly only goes on wavering, lingering, thinking he will do it And remember: tomorrow never comes.\n(Mind -- your master or your manservant. That's what Osho talked about next.) The moment one tastes the nectar of meditation all darkness disappears, all misery disappears, all beggarliness disappears. One becomes a prince, a princess, because one enters into the kingdom of god. In fact one becomes a god. But meditation is the alchemy, the whole secret is in meditation.\nThese are the two possibilities: one is mind, the other is meditation. Mind keeps you attached to the world, to things, to the visible, to the ordinary, to the mundane. Meditation opens the doors for the invisible, for the sacred. Mind is tethered with the non-essential and meditation gives you the essential. The distance is vast in a sense -- it is the biggest distance possible -- but in another sense it can happen in a single moment or even in a split second because it is only a question of understanding the point.\nMeditation means knowing that you are not the mind, becoming aware that mind is separate from you; you are awareness of the mind, and awareness of the mind is not mind, cannot be. Mind is an object and you are subjectivity. You can see your mind functioning -- thought coming and going. It is just like a road, and the traffic goes on and on and people are passing -- memories, faces, dreams,\nthoughts, desires. It is a queue, a continuous queue, non-ending; day in, day out it continues. But you can become aware of it.\nOrdinarily we are not aware of it; that's what is known as metaphysical sleep. The moment you become aware of the traffic of the mind the metaphysical sleep is broken, you are awake for the first time. Knowing that mind is separate is enough to bring the revolution. The moment it becomes your own experience that you are not the mind, you have entered into the kingdom of god.\nSo in a sense the distance is vast, in a sense there is no distance; just a single insight is enough and like a blow of a sword one is cut away from the mind; the identity with the mind is dropped. Then mind remains; you can use it whenever you want and you can turn it off whenever you want. On or off -- it depends on 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nyou. Mind is no more your master.\nOrdinarily it is the master and you are the slave. Meditation makes you the master and mind starts functioning as a slave. And as a slave mind is beautiful, as a master it is very dangerous.\n(The next new sannyasin, listed as a mathematician, was named Gyan Atit -- transcendence of knowledge!)\nKnowledge is a barrier, not a bridge. It prevents you from knowing because it gives you a false sense of knowing. And remember, the danger is never from ignorance, the danger is from so-called knowledge. The ignorant person is far more innocent, in a far healthier state than the knowledgeable, because the ignorant knows he is ignorant. Knowing that he is ignorant he remains humble, he remains simple, and out of that humbleness and simplicity there is a possibility of wisdom.\nBut the knowledgeable person covers up his ignorance and starts behaving as if he knows, but all that he knows is \"as if\". Slowly slowly he can become auto-\nhypnotised by that \"as if\" and he can forget the \"as if\"\ncompletely and he can start believing that he knows. Now this man is in real trouble because he will stop enquiring and he will become very egoistic.\nThe pundits, the scholars, the professors, are very egoistic people for the simple reason that they believe they know -- and they know nothing. And everybody is knowledgeable, more or less.\nOne has to put aside all knowledge, one has to look beyond it. Beyond is the world of the stars.\nKnowledge keeps you tethered to the earth, it never allows you to see the stars. It never allows you to see the beyond, and beyond is what god means -- the beyond. Going beyond knowledge is going into the beyond.\nGoing beyond knowledge is going into the beyond. Dropping knowledge is creating an opportunity to know.\nSocrates says: I know only one thing, that I know nothing.\nThis is the beginning of wisdom, this is transcendence, this is the meaning of your name.\n(His address to the next sannyasin, Vedaprem, was in a similar vein.) The only criterion of wisdom is love. The knowledgeable person is not a loving person, he cannot be.\nHe is so full of rubbish, he is so much in his head... that his heart functions no more.\nHis whole energy has moved into the head. He has become just his head, he has forgotten the way to his heart.\nEven if he loves he loves through the head; he thinks he loves. Even love is not love -- not a feeling.\nThat too is a conclusion, a logical conclusion that one needs love, that it is nourishing, that it is a necessity of life, but all these are conclusions of the mind.\nA man of love is bound to be a man of wisdom. These two things are two aspects of the same coin. One can begin from either; either you start becoming love, then wisdom will come as a shadow of your love, or you start by becoming wise and love will come as its shadow. But remember, by wise I mean intelligent, not knowledgeable.\nIntellect is not intelligence and to be an intellectual is not necessarily to be intelligent. Intelligence is a totally different quality. The intellectual only repeats whatsoever he has learned. In any situation which is absolutely new, about which he knows nothing, he is an utter fool. He cannot act spontaneously, his whole activity comes from his memory. If there is something in his memory then he is very knowledgeable, he is an expert. If some situation arises for which he has a ready-made answer then he will prove that he knows much. But even a small problem which is new is impossible for him; he cannot solve it.\nThe intelligent person has a certain immediacy. He can respond to any situation. He does not depend on the memory, he depends on awareness. And wisdom means awareness, intelligence, meditativeness. It is not of the mind, it is of the heart. In the beginning it is of the heart and finally it is not even of the heart; then it is of the being, ultimately it is of the being. And these are the three most important centres, upper centres: the head, the heart, the being.\nThe first step is from the head to the heart, the second step is from the heart to the being. And the moment you reach your being you have reached to the very centre of existence. It is not your centre alone, it is the centre of everything that is. In religious words you call it god, but you can simply call it t centre -- and that will do.\nMan's whole life has become burdened too much with words. God is a word, truth is a word, love is a 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nword, beauty is a word. He has not experienced anything. He goes on accumulating these words just as a few stupid people go on accumulating postal stamps.\nPeople accumulate words... and the word is not the thing. The word \"fire\" is not fire; you cannot cook anything on it. The word 'love' is not love. But if you watch you will be surprised how we are living in words. People go on saying to each other \"I love you\" without meaning anything.\nA lover was saying to his beloved, \"No force of the world can prevent me from loving you. We have to become one. I can go through fire, I will cross seven oceans to reach you.\" When he was departing the girl asked \"Are you coming tomorrow?\" He said \"If it doesn't rain.\" And he was going to cross seven oceans!\nBut these are words, and people live and exchange words. You say to somebody \"I love you\". And of course he says \"The same to you\". (laughter) You exchange words.\nI have heard about an army man who because of his courage in the war was given a very high post. He had been just an ordinary soldier; he was made a major. When he became a major his friends -- other majors and other top officials -- were puzzled because whenever another soldier would say to him \"Good morning, Sir,\" he would say good morning and quietly he would say \"The same to you\" -- so silently almost like a whisper, \"The same to you.\" But he always said it.\nFinally they asked \"What is the matter? Why do you say 'The same to you'?\" He said \"Because I have been a soldier myself.\" They said \"We don't understand.\" He said \"The problem is I have been a soldier so whenever I used to say 'Good morning, Sir,' deep down I was saying 'You bastard! (laughter) Son of a Bitch! Fuck you!' I used to say all these things, and they must be saying the same things to me! So I know! I say 'The same to you!'\"\nThese things are not said; what we say is \"Good morning, Sir.\"\nPeople are continuously, on the surface -- even in the deeper layers -- full of words; they are saying one thing, thinking another thing; on a third layer some dream is passing by. And these are all layers of words. If you watch the layers of words you will be surprised, it is like an onion: layers and layers. You peel one layer there is another layer, you peel that layer and there is another layer. It is like Chinese boxes, boxes within boxes -- and we are lost in them.\nA sannyasin has to transcend all words, word as such has to be transcended. You have to learn the art of wordless silence, you have to enter into that silence\nwhere the word has disappeared.\nThe Bible begins: In the beginning there was the word. What nonsense! How can there be a word when there was no man? If I had to rewrite it I would write: there was silence, in the beginning there was silence, absolute silence.\nWord must have entered later on, only when god created man. He created animals, trees, etcetera; on the sixth day he created man. And they say he created man first and woman next because he wanted the poor guy at least to say something to him. Once the woman is there she won't allow it! (laughter) So with man enters the word, with mind enters the word. And the moment you leave the word aside, mind is transcended, man is transcended. In fact the word \"man\" comes from the same root as mind; it comes from a Sanskrit root \"man. From man both words, mind and man, are derived.\nMind is man. And what is mind? -- the word. To transcend the word is to transcend the world too, because once you are beyond words you are beyond the world. That is true renunciation. You don't escape to the mountains but you have escaped into the deepest core of your being. Then you can live in the marketplace and yet you will not be of the marketplace.\n(Love is the suprememost value, Osho said as a starter tonight. And he concluded by returning to the same theme.)\nLove is the foundation on which one's life can become a temple and one's being can become a host for the divine guest.\nI teach love and nothing else, because everything else can follow without any effort. If you are capable of love you are capable of the impossible. If one can manage to be loving one has succeeded in finding the path, in finding the truth. The only difficulty is that love demands that you drop the barrier of the ego.\nThe ego is just like a great barrier between you and the reality; it allows you only glimpses of reality.\nAnd it goes on interpreting reality, it never allows it as it is. It continuously goes on giving a commentary on it: \"This is beautiful, that is ugly. Look -- this is good, that is bad.\" It never gives you any opportunity to see what is exactly the case. Before you can see it has already interpreted, it has already contaminated; it has already come in.\nScientists say the mind allows only two per cent of reality to enter; ninety-eight per cent is prevented.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThat is too much! The mind is a great barrier, it is standing there at the door, watching what goes in and allowing only that which fits with it, which adjusts to it.\nLove means changing the very focus of your life. It is coming down from the head to the heart, and as you come to the heart, the heart allows everything, one hundred per cent. It is just an opening, a window into existence. It allows the sun, the moon, the stars, the flowers, the birds, the rain, the wind -- it goes on allowing everything. And the more existence reaches you, the more bliss happens. The more existence penetrates you, the more you become alive, the more you become divine. So logic has to be dropped and love has to be learned.\nOur society continuously teaches us logic and prevents us from moving towards the world of love. That is a great strategy to keep people hung up in their heads. Heady people are efficient but they are just like machines, robots.\nSannyas means de-automatising yourself. The society has made you an automatic robot; sannyas has to uncondition you, to make you your natural self again, the way god wanted you to be, the way nature intended you to be -- not what society wanted, not what the politicians and the priests have desired, but what nature intended.\nLove is a natural phenomenon, logic is man's invention. Rely more on nature, trust the natural more and your life will become full of benediction, full of grace, full of god.\nJust the Tip of the Iceberg Chapter #4\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"3239","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/just_the_tip_of_the_iceberg/part3/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/just_the_tip_of_the_iceberg/>Just The Tip Of The Iceberg</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>16 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;3239 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Just_The_Tip_Of_The_Iceberg/part3.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part2>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

individuals to jump out of this garbage. And if a vast number of people
in the world start living the life of love then others will
automatically be attracted to it It is bound to happen, because every
man whose heart becomes full of love becomes a magnet. He becomes an
energy field, and whosoever comes in contact with such a person is bound
to be affected by it. Love is infectious.</p><p>So live love and spread love. That's my message to the
sannyasins.</p><p>If you are courageous you can be blissful, if you are not courageous
you are bound to remain miserable.</p><p>Misery simply shows that the person is a coward, because the coward
cannot drop anything. Even though he is miserable, even though it is
misery, he clings. Whatsoever is there he clings to it. He is unable to
renounce anything. He knows it hurts but he is more afraid of the
unknown than the known, which is giving him fear, which is giving him
misery, which is giving his all kinds of anguishes, anxieties.</p><p>At least one comfort is there, it is known. And he goes on clinging
to it. He only says that he wants to be blissful but he does nothing
because he cannot take the</p><p>basic step. The basic step is to drop misery --</p><p>because misery is not clinging to anybody, it is <em>we</em> who
cling to it.</p><p>So a really courageous person can drop it instantly, not even
gradually, because that too shows cowardliness. That shows that, we will
drop it slowly slowly so that we can become accustomed to the unknown
first; as it becomes more familiar we can drop a little bit more. But
then it can take lives! And even then he will not be transformed.</p><p>Transformation needs a discontinuity; not a gradual change but a
jump, a quantum leap from the known into the unknown. It needs the heart
of a gambler.</p><p>So be courageous and drop all that creates misery in you. And drop it
immediately, don't postpone it for tomorrow The coward always postpones.
The courageous does it immediately; once he sees the point he is ready
to do it whatsoever the risk, whatsoever the cost.</p><p>The cowardly only goes on wavering, lingering, thinking he will do it
And remember: tomorrow never comes.</p><p>(Mind -- your master or your manservant. That's what Osho talked
about next.) The moment one tastes the nectar of meditation all darkness
disappears, all misery disappears, all beggarliness disappears. One
becomes a prince, a princess, because one enters into the kingdom of
god. In fact one becomes a god. But meditation is the alchemy, the whole
secret is in meditation.</p><p>These are the two possibilities: one is mind, the other is
meditation. Mind keeps you attached to the world, to things, to the
visible, to the ordinary, to the mundane. Meditation opens the doors for
the invisible, for the sacred. Mind is tethered with the non-essential
and meditation gives you the essential. The distance is vast in a sense
-- it is the biggest distance possible -- but in another sense it can
happen in a single moment or even in a split second because it is only a
question of understanding the point.</p><p>Meditation means knowing that you are not the mind, becoming aware
that mind is separate from you; you are awareness of the mind, and
awareness of the mind is not mind, cannot be. Mind is an object and you
are subjectivity. You can see your mind functioning -- thought coming
and going. It is just like a road, and the traffic goes on and on and
people are passing -- memories, faces, dreams,</p><p>thoughts, desires. It is a queue, a continuous queue, non-ending; day
in, day out it continues. But you can become aware of it.</p><p>Ordinarily we are not aware of it; that's what is known as
metaphysical sleep. The moment you become aware of the traffic of the
mind the metaphysical sleep is broken, you are awake for the first time.
Knowing that mind is separate is enough to bring the revolution. The
moment it becomes your own experience that you are not the mind, you
have entered into the kingdom of god.</p><p>So in a sense the distance is vast, in a sense there is no distance;
just a single insight is enough and like a blow of a sword one is cut
away from the mind; the identity with the mind is dropped. Then mind
remains; you can use it whenever you want and you can turn it off
whenever you want. On or off -- it depends on 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on

<em>you</em> the master and mind starts functioning as a slave. And as a
slave mind is beautiful, as a master it is very dangerous.</p><p>(The next new sannyasin, listed as a mathematician, was named Gyan
Atit -- transcendence of knowledge!)</p><p>Knowledge is a barrier, not a bridge. It prevents you from knowing
because it gives you a false sense of knowing. And remember, the danger
is never from ignorance, the danger is from so-called knowledge. The
ignorant person is far more innocent, in a far healthier state than the
knowledgeable, because the ignorant knows he is ignorant. Knowing that
he is ignorant he remains humble, he remains simple, and out of that
humbleness and simplicity there is a possibility of wisdom.</p><p>But the knowledgeable person covers up his ignorance and starts
behaving as if he knows, but all that he knows is "as if". Slowly slowly
he can become auto-</p><p>hypnotised by that "as if" and he can forget the "as if"</p><p>completely and he can start believing that he knows. Now this man is
in real trouble because he will stop enquiring and he will become very
egoistic.</p><p>The pundits, the scholars, the professors, are very egoistic people
for the simple reason that they believe they know -- and they know
nothing. And everybody is knowledgeable, more or less.</p><p>One has to put aside all knowledge, one has to look beyond it. Beyond
is the world of the stars.</p><p>Knowledge keeps you tethered to the earth, it never allows you to see
the stars. It never allows you to see the beyond, and beyond is what god
means -- the beyond. Going beyond knowledge is going into the
beyond.</p><p>Going beyond knowledge is going into the beyond. Dropping knowledge
is creating an opportunity to know.</p><p>Socrates says: I know only one thing, that I know nothing.</p><p>This is the beginning of wisdom, this is transcendence, this is the
meaning of your name.</p><p>(His address to the next sannyasin, Vedaprem, was in a similar vein.)
The only criterion of wisdom is love. The knowledgeable person is not a
loving person, he cannot be.</p><p>He is so full of rubbish, he is so much in his head... that his heart
functions no more.</p><p>His whole energy has moved into the head. He has become just his
head, he has forgotten the way to his heart.</p><p>Even if he loves he loves through the head; he <em>thinks</em> he
loves. Even love is not love -- not a feeling.</p><p>That too is a conclusion, a logical conclusion that one needs love,
that it is nourishing, that it is a necessity of life, but all these are
conclusions of the mind.</p><p>A man of love is bound to be a man of wisdom. These two things are
two aspects of the same coin. One can begin from either; either you
start becoming love, then wisdom will come as a shadow of your love, or
you start by becoming wise and love will come as its shadow. But
remember, by wise I mean intelligent, not knowledgeable.</p><p>Intellect is not intelligence and to be an intellectual is not
necessarily to be intelligent. Intelligence is a totally different
quality. The intellectual only repeats whatsoever he has learned. In any
situation which is absolutely new, about which he knows nothing, he is
an utter fool. He cannot act spontaneously, his whole activity comes
from his memory. If there is something in his memory then he is very
knowledgeable, he is an expert. If some situation arises for which he
has a ready-made answer then he will prove that he knows much. But even
a small problem which is new is impossible for him; he cannot solve
it.</p><p>The intelligent person has a certain immediacy. He can respond to any
situation. He does not depend on the memory, he depends on awareness.
And wisdom means awareness, intelligence, meditativeness. It is not of
the mind, it is of the heart. In the beginning it is of the heart and
finally it is not even of the heart; then it is of the being, ultimately
it is of the being. And these are the three most important centres,
upper centres: the head, the heart, the being.</p><p>The first step is from the head to the heart, the second step is from
the heart to the being. And the moment you reach your being you have
reached to the very centre of existence. It is not your centre alone, it
is the centre of everything that is. In religious words you call it god,
but you can simply call it t centre -- and that will do.</p><p>Man's whole life has become burdened too much with words. God is a
word, truth is a word, love is a 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on

accumulating these words just as a few stupid people go on accumulating
postal stamps.</p><p>People accumulate words... and the word is not the thing. The word
"fire" is not fire; you cannot cook anything on it. The word 'love' is
not love. But if you watch you will be surprised how we are living in
words. People go on saying to each other "I love you" without meaning
anything.</p><p>A lover was saying to his beloved, "No force of the world can prevent
me from loving you. We have to become one. I can go through fire, I will
cross seven oceans to reach you." When he was departing the girl asked
"Are you coming tomorrow?" He said "If it doesn't rain." And he was
going to cross seven oceans!</p><p>But these are words, and people live and exchange words. You say to
somebody "I love you". And of course he says "The same to you".
(laughter) You exchange words.</p><p>I have heard about an army man who because of his courage in the war
was given a very high post. He had been just an ordinary soldier; he was
made a major. When he became a major his friends -- other majors and
other top officials -- were puzzled because whenever another soldier
would say to him "Good morning, Sir," he would say good morning and
quietly he would say "The same to you" -- so silently almost like a
whisper, "The same to you." But he always said it.</p><p>Finally they asked "What is the matter? Why do you say 'The same to
you'?" He said "Because I have been a soldier myself." They said "We
don't understand." He said "The problem is I have been a soldier so
whenever I used to say 'Good morning, Sir,' deep down I was saying 'You
bastard! (laughter) Son of a Bitch! Fuck you!' I used to say all these
things, and they must be saying the same things to me! So I know! I say
'The same to you!'"</p><p>These things are not said; what we say is "Good morning, Sir."</p><p>People are continuously, on the surface -- even in the deeper layers
-- full of words; they are saying one thing, thinking another thing; on
a third layer some dream is passing by. And these are all layers of
words. If you watch the layers of words you will be surprised, it is
like an onion: layers and layers. You peel one layer there is another
layer, you peel that layer and there is another layer. It is like
Chinese boxes, boxes within boxes -- and we are lost in them.</p><p>A sannyasin has to transcend all words, word as such has to be
transcended. You have to learn the art of wordless silence, you have to
enter into that silence</p><p>where the word has disappeared.</p><p>The Bible begins: In the beginning there was the word. What nonsense!
How can there be a word when there was no man? If I had to rewrite it I
would write: there was silence, in the beginning there was silence,
absolute silence.</p><p>Word must have entered later on, only when god created man. He
created animals, trees, etcetera; on the sixth day he created man. And
they say he created man first and woman next because he wanted the poor
guy at least to say something to him. Once the woman is there she won't
allow it! (laughter) So with man enters the word, with mind enters the
word. And the moment you leave the word aside, mind is transcended, man
is transcended. In fact the word "man" comes from the same root as mind;
it comes from a Sanskrit root "man. From man both words, mind and man,
are derived.</p><p>Mind is man. And what is mind? -- the word. To transcend the word is
to transcend the world too, because once you are beyond words you are
beyond the world. That is true renunciation. You don't escape to the
mountains but you have escaped into the deepest core of your being. Then
you can live in the marketplace and yet you will not be of the
marketplace.</p><p>(Love is the suprememost value, Osho said as a starter tonight. And
he concluded by returning to the same theme.)</p><p>Love is the foundation on which one's life can become a temple and
one's being can become a host for the divine guest.</p><p>I teach love and nothing else, because everything else can follow
without any effort. If you are capable of love you are capable of the
impossible. If one can manage to be loving one has succeeded in finding
the path, in finding the truth. The only difficulty is that love demands
that you drop the barrier of the ego.</p><p>The ego is just like a great barrier between you and the reality; it
allows you only glimpses of reality.</p><p>And it goes on interpreting reality, it never allows it as it is. It
continuously goes on giving a commentary on it: "This is beautiful, that
is ugly. Look -- this is good, that is bad." It never gives you any
opportunity to see what is exactly the case. Before you can see it has
already interpreted, it has already contaminated; it has already come
in.</p><p>Scientists say the mind allows only two per cent of reality to enter;
ninety-eight per cent is prevented.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>That is too much! The mind is a great barrier, it is standing there
at the door, watching what goes in and allowing only that which fits
with it, which adjusts to it.</p><p>Love means changing the very focus of your life. It is coming down
from the head to the heart, and as you come to the heart, the heart
allows everything, one hundred per cent. It is just an opening, a window
into existence. It allows the sun, the moon, the stars, the flowers, the
birds, the rain, the wind -- it goes on allowing everything. And the
more existence reaches you, the more bliss happens. The more existence
penetrates you, the more you become alive, the more you become divine.
So logic has to be dropped and love has to be learned.</p><p>Our society continuously teaches us logic and prevents us from moving
towards the world of love. That is a great strategy to keep people hung
up in their heads. Heady people are efficient but they are just like
machines, robots.</p><p>Sannyas means de-automatising yourself. The society has made you an
automatic robot; sannyas has to uncondition you, to make you your
natural self again, the way god wanted you to be, the way nature
intended you to be -- not what society wanted, not what the politicians
and the priests have desired, but what nature intended.</p><p>Love is a natural phenomenon, logic is man's invention. Rely more on
nature, trust the natural more and your life will become full of
benediction, full of grace, full of god.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=just-the-tip-of-the-iceberg>Just the Tip of the Iceberg</h3><p>Chapter #4</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part2>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

It is for reference purposes only.]\n(Our nature, pure and simple, is to be pure and simple, Osho reminded us in his first address tonight.) We come into the world absolutely pure and innocent, absolutely clear, clean, but then the world starts writing on our consciousness, it starts conditioning us. It pollutes everybody, it contaminates, poisons. By the time a child is mature enough to think on his of the world has already destroyed him. He is already crippled, paralysed; the world has already taught him to use crutches and he has forgotten to use his own insight. He cannot stand on his own legs; it has made him dependent.\nThis is the greatest conspiracy against humanity, to make every human being a cripple -- not physically but spiritually. And the strategy that is used is to give you a mind so that your consciousness becomes covered with thoughts, desires, ambitions, ego, ideologies, religion, politics, and a thousand and one things are there, layer upon layer. Your mirrorlike consciousness disappears and then a man lives a life of indignity, a life which is absolutely graceless, a life of blindness, a life of utter dependency.\nFirst the child depends on the parents and they enjoy the child being dependent on them. Then they force the child to depend on the teachers, on the priests, on the politicians and whosoever is in authority.\nYou always have to look up to the authority, you have to follow orders and be obedient.\nObedience has been almost like a cancer. It has been used against man to destroy his freedom, to destroy his very soul. And once they have destroyed it they start talking about purity: Be pure, be moral, be integrated, be sincere, be honest. First they destroy all possibilities and then they start talking about great values. That is another strategy to make you feel guilty, because you cannot manage it. They have destroyed all your possibilities and now they are expecting you to be pure.\nYou were pure in the first place but they did not allow it. Once they covered your mind with great clouds; now they want you to be pure -- and it becomes very difficult, almost impossible, and then a guilt arises in you. You start feeling unworthy, you lose all self-respect. And once a man loses his self-respect he loses all. Then he is just a slave; he will serve all the vested interests, the establishment. He will be only a functionary, a machine, he will not be a human being.\nAnd that's what these exploiters and oppressors of all kinds need -- not human beings but machines.\nThey don't want you to be anything more than your functions, your duties. You should end at your functions, you should not have anything more than them, because that anything more could be dangerous; You may start thinking on your own and then you will no longer be able to support all kinds of superstitions 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nwhich have been imposed upon you. You may start contemplating and then certainly you cannot always say yes; many times, in fact ninety-nine times out of one hundred, you will have to say no.\nYou may even start meditating if you are allowed -- and that will give you absolute freedom because it will help you to rediscover your nature. Society is very much afraid of giving you anything more than a machine needs. It brings\nyou down to the minimum and at the minimum nobody can be blissful. Bliss happens only at the maximum, when you have reached to the optimum, to the highest peak of your potential.\nAnd the only thing to be done is to undo whatsoever the society has done to you. That's the purpose of sannyas: it is an undoing, it is a dismantling, it is a dispelling all pollutants that society has put into you. It is a kind of returning to the source, to your natural purity.\nSo I don't teach purity, I don't teach morality -- that is all nonsense. I only teach meditation so you can get rid of the mind. The mind belongs to society and meditation belongs to you. With meditation you are absolutely free, and suddenly you start discovering your intrinsic treasures. And then begins a great pilgrimage of joys, beauty, beauties, songs, celebrations. And it is an unending process. It gives you the vision of eternity. It gives you the certainty that you are immortal.\nAnd to know it is to become part of god, is to be divine.\n(And continuing the theme, Osho turned to the next sannyasin -- a taxi driver from Germany.) Mind is a bondage, it is a prison, but a very subtle, invisible one; and a very strange one too, because ordinarily the prison is outside you and you are inside the prison. But with the mind it is just the opposite: you are outside the prison and the prison is inside you. It goes on deceiving you very easily because you don't see any walls around you; you can believe that you are free. But you are not free if your mind dominates you. And it does dominate you; it goes on pulling strings from behind you and you are just a puppet. The puppet can think it is free, that all these movements are his -- they are not.\nUnless one gets out of the mind, unless one puts the mind aside, one never knows what freedom is.\nFreedom is the very taste of god; there is nothing higher than it. Freedom means freedom from mind, freedom from body, freedom from birth, freedom from death, freedom from all kinds of limitations. When you feel you are unlimited and there are no boundaries to you, then only do you know what freedom is.\nOtherwise one is confined in a very small space which is overcrowded with desires, ambitions, expectations, frustrations, dreams, memories. It is so overcrowded that you are almost crushed by the crowd that you are carrying\nwithin yourself. What freedom can one have in such a crowded space? There is no space even to move.\nOne needs spaciousness. Meditation brings space to you, it creates space, it throws out all junk. And whatsoever your mind has is nothing but junk. It is a junkyard, a graveyard carrying corpses of the past and carrying unnecessary, stupid dreams about the future which are never going to happen; they have never happened. Between the past and the future you are confined, and both are non- existential. The past is no more and the future is not yet, and between these two non-existentials you are crushed.\nMeditation means to be here, to be now -- no more past, no more future. This very moment is all. And suddenly there is freedom, suddenly you start rising upwards from all kinds of bondage.\nMeditation is a simple phenomenon of being here and now, dying to the past every moment, not carrying it at all and not bothering about tomorrow, because it never comes. It is always now, it is never then. It is always here, it is never there. There and then don't exist, here and now exist; in fact they are two sides of the same coin. Even physics have come to the insight that time and space are not separate. Here means space, now means time.\nOne of the greatest contributions of Albert Einstein is the theory that time is a fourth dimension of space, it is not a separate thing. Space is three-dimensional and time is the fourth dimension. But this has been the insight of the mystics. It is so old that it is difficult to say when it really happened for the first time; it is the most ancient insight of the mystics. But it is natural: science has to follow only after thousands of years because its very procedure is a very long-winded one. But now physicists are saying exactly what the mystics said five thousand years ago, that now and here are two sides of the same coin. And that's the only thing that is real; all else is either imagination or memory.\nGetting out of memory and imagination is meditation, and the moment you are in meditation you are free, you are released from the prison.\n(Tonight Osho compared morality that is imposed on a person to lipstick!) 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nYou can paint your lips red -- that does not mean that you are so healthy, so young, that your lips are red. But you can paint them red. And there are millions of foolish women all over the world -- one wonders whom they are deceiving -- whose whole face shows one colour and their lips show another colour. It is so clear And there are layers of lipstick.\nI even wonder: who are the people who kiss them? (much laughter) Some mad, insane people -- they must be -- otherwise, who wants to taste lipstick? But that's how it is happening on many many planes of human life. Morality is just like lipsticks you paint yourself from the outside, you make a beautiful face, a mask, you pretend to be somebody you are not.\nWhen you are full of tears you smile, when you are angry you don't show it, you go on repressing it.\nNaturally this whole process creates a division is you. The tears were real but you did not allow them, you pushed them back. And the smile was false but you tried to smile. It cannot go very deep, it is only on the lips. It is just an exercise of the lips, a Jimmy Carter exercise. It has nothing to do with you.\nYou must have heard about the grin of the cheshire cat. The cat disappears but the grin remains. I always think that even if Jimmy Carter disappears the smile will remain there, because it has nothing to do with Jimmy Carter; the smile can continue on its own. Jimmy Carter is gone but the smile continues because it is something separate, totally separate. It has its own autonomy.\nMorality is just like that: a false smile. You practise morality but that does not give you dignity of character.\nDignity of character comes through meditation. You are not practising anything as far as your character is concerned, but your insight grows. You start seeing things as they are, and naturally when you start seeing things as they are your whole life is transformed in this new light, in this new vision. You cannot behave in the old way. You cannot deceive anybody because now through meditation one knows that we are not separate -- who are you deceiving? You are deceiving yourself. You cannot be violent, you cannot hurt, you cannot enjoy hurting\nanybody because now you know that the other is part of you as you are part of the other. We are part of one organic universe, we are not separate entities at all.\nThen of course you will have a dignity of character and a dignity will come through integrity. You will not be divided, you will be one. Your vision will be one, your lifestyle will simply be a consequence of it, not against it, nothing imposed. It is like healthy lips the redness comes from the blood circulating inside. It is a totally different phenomenon.\nSo remember, meditation has to be the source of real character. One can forget all about character -- just put your whole energy into meditation and out of it arises a character. It is not something put together by you, it comes spontaneously. And when character is spontaneous it has a beauty of its own, it is a joy. It is not a means to any end, it is an end unto itself.\n(How long will you be here? Osho added. Two months, maybe more, was the reply.) Let it be more!'\n(Bliss is the fragrance of inner unfolding, Osho told Anand Sugandha.) Ordinarily people live a closed life. They don't open their doors and windows. They live in fear, hiding, always afraid of the unknown. They don't allow the sun, the rain, the wind, to enter their being. But if you put a rose plant in your room and you close all the windows and all the doors and no wind, no rain, no sun reaches it, you cannot hope that the rose-bush will survive; it will die. That's how people are -- almost dead.\nThey are living a dead life, just dragging somehow.\nTo really live one has to be available to all that is. One has to be open and vulnerable, one has to drop all fears. There is only one thing one should be afraid of, and that is fear. Except for that never be afraid of anything, because fear cripples, kills. And the moment you start moving towards the unknown, in spite of all the fears, your life starts having many new thing, of which you were never aware, because as the adventure deepens, your thrill, your ecstasy, deepens with it.\nAs you start moving into the unknown there are so many challenges to be faced,\nencountered, that naturally you become more aware, more alert, more cautious, more conscious. You have to be. It is walking on a razor's edges how can you be sloppy? Sloppy? You have to be cautious and alert, it is risky. And whenever there is risk, your intelligence becomes sharp. And when intelligence is sharp, ecstasy is great and you are thrilled at each movement; at each step your inner being starts unfolding.\nOnly in this climate of adventure, ecstasy, integrity, risk, danger, intelligence, awareness, does the inner being open. The bud becomes a flower.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nIn the East we have called it a one-thousand-petalled lotus, this opening of the inner flower. There is no flower like it because it is the flower of consciousness, it is unique. And the perfume of it is what is called enlightenment, Buddhahood, Christ-consciousness. That's the fragrance.\nBliss is the fragrance of a life lived totally, dangerously, exploring the unknown and the unknowable.\n(We nave to remember two words and the difference between them, he told us tonight -- information and transformation.)\nPeople go on collecting information -- they think it is knowledge. It is not. It it deception, self --\ndeception. Knowing happens through transformation, not through information. Information can make you a scholar, a pundit, a knowledgeable person, but it cannot make you wise. You will be as stupid as ever, or maybe more.\nScholars have only repressed their ignorance. It has not left them, it is deep inside them. Of course they have accumulated much knowledge, but because it is not their own it has no value, no validity, no truth.\nOne can repeat the Bible like a parrot -- that does not mean that one becomes a Moses or a Jesus, otherwise all the universities would be creating many Jesuses, Buddhas, Krishnas. Universities have utterly failed in creating wise people.\nIf once in a while a person who has passed through the universities becomes wise, that simply means he has become wise in spite of the university, not because of the university; he must have been very very cautious. The university could not destroy him, because the universities can only impart information.\nSannyas is the beginning of transformation. It is a change of the very base of your life, it is a change of your very outlook, it is a change at the deepest core of your being. It is a shift from mind to no-mind, from noise to silence, from continuous chattering inside to profound silence. This change of gestalt releases your wisdom. And to live in one's own light is the most glorious thing; only then can one feel grateful to god, never before it.\nThe animal love is unconscious.\nDivine love is absolutely conscious. Human love is half way between the two, hence in human love there is always a conflict, one's being feels torn apart. That's why although love gives people great hopes, those hopes are never fulfilled. On the contrary, every hope brings great frustrations, disillusionment.\nLove promises ecstasies but what it really brings is agony. It is human love, so it is bound to be so, because human love is a tense affair. A part of it is absolutely ready to go back to the animal world -- that's the sexual part in love. And the other part wants to transcend, to go beyond even the human -- that is the prayer part in it. Lovers become very much confused; they cannot figure out what actually is the case, because sometimes they feel love as just lust and sometimes they feel it as such a profound prayerfulness that they are puzzled.\nHence love has never been defined. How to define it? If you define it according to the highest peaks it is prayer, but those are rare. If you define it by its ordinary, day-to-day existence, then it is just lust and nothing else. And one cannot conceive how the lust can be prayerful or how the prayer can fall so low that it becomes just an animal desire.\nSo lovers are in a very great confusion, but it is not their fault. My sannyasins have to understand that human love is inevitably a tense affair because it is neither wholly animal nor wholly divine. It is in a continuous conflict. It is\ndivided, it is split; it is in a way schizophrenic.\nEither you have to fall back and behave like animals -- then there is not much conflict... but that is not possible, one cannot fall back, one cannot go back. People have tried all methods to fall back -- alcohol, psychedelic drugs... all kinds of intoxicants are momentary successes in falling back, but after a few hours you are again in the same situation.\nOne can only go ahead, one cannot go back. Human love has to go towards divine love, but that is an arduous task, it is going uphill. The first is impossible but it looks easy; the second is possible but it looks impossible. So many choose the first because it looks easy, but it is not possible at all. The possible is the second but it is not easy. All upward movement is arduous. It needs consciousness, it needs sincerity, it needs commitment, it needs perseverance and patience.\nI am giving you this name Devapriti, just so that you can be reminded again and again. You very name will remind you, will become a reminder that one has to go to the highest peak of love, only then is there fulfillment, only then does one feel at ease, at home.\nHow long will you be here? 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nI will stay until the end of October.\nTill the end of October? Then come back again. And this is your home -- come back forever!\n(In Indian mythology Gandharv is the name of god's musicians, Osho told the newest swami -- Prem Gandharv. And then he spoke to us of love.)\nMusic is pure when even instruments are not needed. And because of that I feel\nthat Indian mythology has more insight than any other mythology. The angels in the Christian heaven go on playing on harps --\neverybody is carrying a harp. They must be really tired by now. (laughter) And the whole day there is no other work, you have to go on playing hallelujah. It must be boring.\nIndian mythology says that the musicians of the gods don't need any instruments, they don't even sing songs. Their silence is their song, their silence is their prayer. That seems to be far more significant, far more dignified.\nSilence is music, pure music.\nThe Zen people say that the ultimate enlightenment is like the sound of one hand clapping. One hand clapping... If two hands clap then there is a clash, conflict. When only one hand is clapping it is of course absolutely silent, there is no sound at all, and that silence is the ultimate music.\nLove is the ultimate music to me. It does not need even the other. If the other is needed then it is either animal love or at the most human love. But when the other is not needed at all, then it is divine love. Then it is not a question of relationship, it is not a question of your even being loving: you become love itself. Then you are the music, you are the song. It is no more a quality, no more an activity. It is your very being.\nAnd when love becomes your being there is great celebration inside. There is no sound, there are no instruments, but one hears a celestial music, a music which is not a created one -- uncreated music. We are made of it so if we go deep in our beings we are bound to find it. It is already there like an undercurrent.\nOnce in a while in certain situations we become aware of it. Seeing a beautiful sunset suddenly you fall silent -- not that you practise being silent or that you try to be silent, no -- it simply happens. The beauty is so tremendous, it is such an awe that you forget to blink your eyes. It is as if for a moment the heartbeat stops; for a moment time stops, mind stops, everything stops; you are in a complete nothingness. And then you feel great beauty, great joy.\nOf course you logically think it is coming from the beautiful sunset -- it is not so. The beautiful sunset may have functioned as a triggering point. It may have triggered a process in you but it is not the cause of it.\nAnd once you understand that there is no cause to it , you can simply close your eyes and you can fall into deep silence any moment. That's what meditation is all about: creating a situation independent of the outside world. No sunset is needed, no beautiful full-moon is needed, no beautiful woman or man is needed, no roses\n, no lotuses are needed. Nothing is needed because you have found that these are only triggering points -- and it can be done by yourself.\nJust by becoming attuned to the inner, you immediately hear something, you immediately become full of something which cannot be expressed in any words whatsoever. It remains unexpressed, inexpressible. But love comes closest to it.\nSo remember, love has to become the music of your life.\nTable of Contents Chapter title: None Chapter title: None Chapter title: None Chapter title: None Chapter title: None Chapter title: None Chapter title: None\nChapter title: Mahaparanirvana day Chapter title: None\n\u003c Previous | Contents\n","wordCount":"3903","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/just_the_tip_of_the_iceberg/part30/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/just_the_tip_of_the_iceberg/>Just The Tip Of The Iceberg</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>19 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;3903 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Just_The_Tip_Of_The_Iceberg/part30.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part29>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a></p><h2 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:justify id=chapter-title-none><span id=bookmark58>‌</span>Chapter title:

Chuang Tzu Auditorium</h3><p>Archive code: 8009305 ShortTitle: ICEBRG30 Audio:</p><p>No Video:</p><p>No</p><p>[NOTE: This is an unedited tape transcript of an unpublished darshan
diary, which has been scanned and cleaned up. It is for reference
purposes only.]</p><p>(Our nature, pure and simple, is to be pure and simple, Osho reminded
us in his first address tonight.) We come into the world absolutely pure
and innocent, absolutely clear, clean, but then the world starts writing
on our consciousness, it starts conditioning us. It pollutes everybody,
it contaminates, poisons. By the time a child is mature enough to think
on his of the world has already destroyed him. He is already crippled,
paralysed; the world has already taught him to use crutches and he has
forgotten to use his own insight. He cannot stand on his own legs; it
has made him dependent.</p><p>This is the greatest conspiracy against humanity, to make every human
being a cripple -- not physically but spiritually. And the strategy that
is used is to give you a mind so that your consciousness becomes covered
with thoughts, desires, ambitions, ego, ideologies, religion, politics,
and a thousand and one things are there, layer upon layer. Your
mirrorlike consciousness disappears and then a man lives a life of
indignity, a life which is absolutely graceless, a life of blindness, a
life of utter dependency.</p><p>First the child depends on the parents and they enjoy the child being
dependent on them. Then they force the child to depend on the teachers,
on the priests, on the politicians and whosoever is in authority.</p><p>You always have to look up to the authority, you have to follow
orders and be obedient.</p><p>Obedience has been almost like a cancer. It has been used against man
to destroy his freedom, to destroy his very soul. And once they have
destroyed it they start talking about purity: Be pure, be moral, be
integrated, be sincere, be honest. First they destroy all possibilities
and then they start talking about great values. That is another strategy
to make you feel guilty, because you cannot manage it. They have
destroyed all your possibilities and now they are expecting you to be
pure.</p><p>You <em>were</em> pure in the first place but they did not allow it.
Once they covered your mind with great clouds; now they want you to be
pure -- and it becomes very difficult, almost impossible, and then a
guilt arises in you. You start feeling unworthy, you lose all
self-respect. And once a man loses his self-respect he loses all. Then
he is just a slave; he will serve all the vested interests, the
establishment. He will be only a functionary, a machine, he will not be
a human being.</p><p>And that's what these exploiters and oppressors of all kinds need --
not human beings but machines.</p><p>They don't want you to be anything more than your functions, your
duties. You should end at your functions, you should not have anything
more than them, because that anything more could be dangerous; You may
start thinking on your own and then you will no longer be able to
support all kinds of superstitions 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>which have been imposed upon you. You may start contemplating and
then certainly you cannot always say yes; many times, in fact
ninety-nine times out of one hundred, you will have to say no.</p><p>You may even start meditating if you are allowed -- and that will
give you absolute freedom because it will help you to rediscover your
nature. Society is very much afraid of giving you anything more than a
machine needs. It brings</p><p>you down to the minimum and at the minimum nobody can be blissful.
Bliss happens only at the maximum, when you have reached to the optimum,
to the highest peak of your potential.</p><p>And the only thing to be done is to undo whatsoever the society has
done to you. That's the purpose of sannyas: it is an undoing, it is a
dismantling, it is a dispelling all pollutants that society has put into
you. It is a kind of returning to the source, to your natural
purity.</p><p>So I don't teach purity, I don't teach morality -- that is all
nonsense. I only teach meditation so you can get rid of the mind. The
mind belongs to society and meditation belongs to you. With meditation
you are absolutely free, and suddenly you start discovering your
intrinsic treasures. And then begins a great pilgrimage of joys, beauty,
beauties, songs, celebrations. And it is an unending process. It gives
you the vision of eternity. It gives you the certainty that you are
immortal.</p><p>And to know it is to become part of god, is to be divine.</p><p>(And continuing the theme, Osho turned to the next sannyasin -- a
taxi driver from Germany.) Mind is a bondage, it is a prison, but a very
subtle, invisible one; and a very strange one too, because ordinarily
the prison is outside you and you are inside the prison. But with the
mind it is just the opposite: you are outside the prison and the prison
is inside you. It goes on deceiving you very easily because you don't
see any walls around you; you can believe that you are free. But you are
not free if your mind dominates you. And it does dominate you; it goes
on pulling strings from behind you and you are just a puppet. The puppet
can think it is free, that all these movements are his -- they are
not.</p><p>Unless one gets out of the mind, unless one puts the mind aside, one
never knows what freedom is.</p><p>Freedom is the very taste of god; there is nothing higher than it.
Freedom means freedom from mind, freedom from body, freedom from birth,
freedom from death, freedom from all kinds of limitations. When you feel
you are unlimited and there are no boundaries to you, then only do you
know what freedom is.</p><p>Otherwise one is confined in a very small space which is overcrowded
with desires, ambitions, expectations, frustrations, dreams, memories.
It is so overcrowded that you are almost crushed by the crowd that you
are carrying</p><p>within yourself. What freedom can one have in such a crowded space?
There is no space even to move.</p><p>One needs spaciousness. Meditation brings space to you, it creates
space, it throws out all junk. And whatsoever your mind has is nothing
but junk. It is a junkyard, a graveyard carrying corpses of the past and
carrying unnecessary, stupid dreams about the future which are never
going to happen; they have never happened. Between the past and the
future you are confined, and both are non- existential. The past is no
more and the future is not yet, and between these two non-existentials
you are crushed.</p><p>Meditation means to be here, to be now -- no more past, no more
future. This very moment is all. And suddenly there is freedom, suddenly
you start rising upwards from all kinds of bondage.</p><p>Meditation is a simple phenomenon of being here and now, dying to the
past every moment, not carrying it at all and not bothering about
tomorrow, because it never comes. It is always now, it is never then. It
is always here, it is never there. There and then don't exist, here and
now exist; in fact they are two sides of the same coin. Even physics
have come to the insight that time and space are not separate. Here
means space, now means time.</p><p>One of the greatest contributions of Albert Einstein is the theory
that time is a fourth dimension of space, it is not a separate thing.
Space is three-dimensional and time is the fourth dimension. But this
has been the insight of the mystics. It is so old that it is difficult
to say when it really happened for the first time; it is the most
ancient insight of the mystics. But it is natural: science has to follow
only after thousands of years because its very procedure is a very
long-winded one. But now physicists are saying exactly what the mystics
said five thousand years ago, that now and here are two sides of the
same coin. And that's the only thing that is real; all else is either
imagination or memory.</p><p>Getting out of memory and imagination is meditation, and the moment
you are in meditation you are free, you are released from the
prison.</p><p>(Tonight Osho compared morality that is imposed on a person to
lipstick!) 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>You can paint your lips red -- that does not mean that you are so
healthy, so young, that your lips are red. But you can paint them red.
And there are millions of foolish women all over the world -- one
wonders whom they are deceiving -- whose whole face shows one colour and
their lips show another colour. It is so clear And there are
<em>layers</em> of lipstick.</p><p>I even wonder: who are the people who kiss them? (much laughter) Some
mad, insane people -- they must be -- otherwise, who wants to taste
lipstick? But that's how it is happening on many many planes of human
life. Morality is just like lipsticks you paint yourself from the
outside, you make a beautiful face, a mask, you pretend to be somebody
you are not.</p><p>When you are full of tears you smile, when you are angry you don't
show it, you go on repressing it.</p><p>Naturally this whole process creates a division is you. The tears
were real but you did not allow them, you pushed them back. And the
smile was false but you tried to smile. It cannot go very deep, it is
only on the lips. It is just an exercise of the lips, a Jimmy Carter
exercise. It has nothing to do with you.</p><p>You must have heard about the grin of the cheshire cat. The cat
disappears but the grin remains. I always think that even if Jimmy
Carter disappears the smile will remain there, because it has nothing to
do with Jimmy Carter; the smile can continue on its own. Jimmy Carter is
gone but the smile continues because it is something separate, totally
separate. It has its own autonomy.</p><p>Morality is just like that: a false smile. You practise morality but
that does not give you dignity of character.</p><p>Dignity of character comes through meditation. You are not practising
anything as far as your character is concerned, but your insight grows.
You start seeing things as they are, and naturally when you start seeing
things as they are your whole life is transformed in this new light, in
this new vision. You cannot behave in the old way. You cannot deceive
anybody because now through meditation one knows that we are not
separate -- who are you deceiving? You are deceiving yourself. You
cannot be violent, you cannot hurt, you cannot enjoy hurting</p><p>anybody because now you know that the other is part of you as you are
part of the other. We are part of one organic universe, we are not
separate entities at all.</p><p>Then of course you will have a dignity of character and a dignity
will come through integrity. You will not be divided, you will be one.
Your vision will be one, your lifestyle will simply be a consequence of
it, not against it, nothing imposed. It is like healthy lips the redness
comes from the blood circulating inside. It is a totally different
phenomenon.</p><p>So remember, meditation has to be the source of real character. One
can forget all about character -- just put your whole energy into
meditation and out of it arises a character. It is not something put
together by you, it comes spontaneously. And when character is
spontaneous it has a beauty of its own, it is a joy. It is not a means
to any end, it is an end unto itself.</p><p>(How long will you be here? Osho added. Two months, maybe more, was
the reply.) Let it be more!'</p><p>(Bliss is the fragrance of inner unfolding, Osho told Anand
Sugandha.) Ordinarily people live a closed life. They don't open their
doors and windows. They live in fear, hiding, always afraid of the
unknown. They don't allow the sun, the rain, the wind, to enter their
being. But if you put a rose plant in your room and you close all the
windows and all the doors and no wind, no rain, no sun reaches it, you
cannot hope that the rose-bush will survive; it will die. That's how
people are -- almost dead.</p><p>They are living a dead life, just dragging somehow.</p><p>To really live one has to be available to all that is. One has to be
open and vulnerable, one has to drop all fears. There is only one thing
one should be afraid of, and that is fear. Except for that never be
afraid of anything, because fear cripples, kills. And the moment you
start moving towards the unknown, in spite of all the fears, your life
starts having many new thing, of which you were never aware, because as
the adventure deepens, your thrill, your ecstasy, deepens with it.</p><p>As you start moving into the unknown there are so many challenges to
be faced,</p><p>encountered, that naturally you become more aware, more alert, more
cautious, more conscious. You have to be. It is walking on a razor's
edges how can you be sloppy? Sloppy? You have to be cautious and alert,
it is risky. And whenever there is risk, your intelligence becomes
sharp. And when intelligence is sharp, ecstasy is great and you are
thrilled at each movement; at each step your inner being starts
unfolding.</p><p>Only in this climate of adventure, ecstasy, integrity, risk, danger,
intelligence, awareness, does the inner being open. The bud becomes a
flower.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>In the East we have called it a one-thousand-petalled lotus, this
opening of the inner flower. There is no flower like it because it is
the flower of consciousness, it is unique. And the perfume of it is what
is called enlightenment, Buddhahood, Christ-consciousness. That's the
fragrance.</p><p>Bliss is the fragrance of a life lived totally, dangerously,
exploring the unknown and the unknowable.</p><p>(We nave to remember two words and the difference between them, he
told us tonight -- information and transformation.)</p><p>People go on collecting information -- they think it is knowledge. It
is not. It it deception, self --</p><p>deception. Knowing happens through transformation, not through
information. Information can make you a scholar, a pundit, a
knowledgeable person, but it cannot make you wise. You will be as stupid
as ever, or maybe more.</p><p>Scholars have only repressed their ignorance. It has not left them,
it is deep inside them. Of course they have accumulated much knowledge,
but because it is not their own it has no value, no validity, no
truth.</p><p>One can repeat the Bible like a parrot -- that does not mean that one
becomes a Moses or a Jesus, otherwise all the universities would be
creating many Jesuses, Buddhas, Krishnas. Universities have utterly
failed in creating wise people.</p><p>If once in a while a person who has passed through the universities
becomes wise, that simply means he has become wise in spite of the
university, not because of the university; he must have been very very
cautious. The university could not destroy him, because the universities
can only impart information.</p><p>Sannyas is the beginning of transformation. It is a change of the
very base of your life, it is a change of your very outlook, it is a
change at the deepest core of your being. It is a shift from mind to
no-mind, from noise to silence, from continuous chattering inside to
profound silence. This change of gestalt releases your wisdom. And to
live in one's own light is the most glorious thing; only then can one
feel grateful to god, never before it.</p><p>The animal love is unconscious.</p><p>Divine love is absolutely conscious. Human love is half way between
the two, hence in human love there is always a conflict, one's being
feels torn apart. That's why although love gives people great hopes,
those hopes are never fulfilled. On the contrary, every hope brings
great frustrations, disillusionment.</p><p>Love promises ecstasies but what it really brings is agony. It is
human love, so it is bound to be so, because human love is a tense
affair. A part of it is absolutely ready to go back to the animal world
-- that's the sexual part in love. And the other part wants to
transcend, to go beyond even the human -- that is the prayer part in it.
Lovers become very much confused; they cannot figure out what actually
is the case, because sometimes they feel love as just lust and sometimes
they feel it as such a profound prayerfulness that they are puzzled.</p><p>Hence love has never been defined. How to define it? If you define it
according to the highest peaks it is prayer, but those are rare. If you
define it by its ordinary, day-to-day existence, then it is just lust
and nothing else. And one cannot conceive how the lust can be prayerful
or how the prayer can fall so low that it becomes just an animal
desire.</p><p>So lovers are in a very great confusion, but it is not their fault.
My sannyasins have to understand that human love is inevitably a tense
affair because it is neither wholly animal nor wholly divine. It is in a
continuous conflict. It is</p><p>divided, it is split; it is in a way schizophrenic.</p><p>Either you have to fall back and behave like animals -- then there is
not much conflict... but that is not possible, one cannot fall back, one
cannot go back. People have tried all methods to fall back -- alcohol,
psychedelic drugs... all kinds of intoxicants are momentary successes in
falling back, but after a few hours you are again in the same
situation.</p><p>One can only go ahead, one cannot go back. Human love has to go
towards divine love, but that is an arduous task, it is going uphill.
The first is impossible but it looks easy; the second is possible but it
looks impossible. So many choose the first because it looks easy, but it
is not possible at all. The possible is the second but it is not easy.
All upward movement is arduous. It needs consciousness, it needs
sincerity, it needs commitment, it needs perseverance and patience.</p><p>I am giving you this name Devapriti, just so that you can be reminded
again and again. You very name will remind you, will become a reminder
that one has to go to the highest peak of love, only then is there
fulfillment, only then does one feel at ease, at home.</p><p>How long will you be here? 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>I will stay until the end of October.</p><p>Till the end of October? Then come back again. And this is your home
-- come back forever!</p><p>(In Indian mythology Gandharv is the name of god's musicians, Osho
told the newest swami -- Prem Gandharv. And then he spoke to us of
love.)</p><p>Music is pure when even instruments are not needed. And because of
that I feel</p><p>that Indian mythology has more insight than any other mythology. The
angels in the Christian heaven go on playing on harps --</p><p>everybody is carrying a harp. They must be really tired by now.
(laughter) And the whole day there is no other work, you have to go on
playing hallelujah. It must be boring.</p><p>Indian mythology says that the musicians of the gods don't need any
instruments, they don't even sing songs. Their silence is their song,
their silence is their prayer. That seems to be far more significant,
far more dignified.</p><p>Silence is music, pure music.</p><p>The Zen people say that the ultimate enlightenment is like the sound
of one hand clapping. <em>One</em> hand clapping... If two hands clap
then there is a clash, conflict. When only one hand is clapping it is of
course absolutely silent, there is no sound at all, and that silence is
the ultimate music.</p><p>Love is the ultimate music to me. It does not need even the other. If
the other is needed then it is either animal love or at the most human
love. But when the other is not needed at all, then it is divine love.
Then it is not a question of relationship, it is not a question of your
even being loving: you become love itself. Then you are the music, you
are the song. It is no more a quality, no more an activity. It is your
very being.</p><p>And when love becomes your being there is great celebration inside.
There is no sound, there are no instruments, but one hears a celestial
music, a music which is not a created one -- uncreated music. We are
made of it so if we go deep in our beings we are bound to find it. It is
already there like an undercurrent.</p><p>Once in a while in certain situations we become aware of it. Seeing a
beautiful sunset suddenly you fall silent -- not that you practise being
silent or that you try to be silent, no -- it simply happens. The beauty
is so tremendous, it is such an awe that you forget to blink your eyes.
It is as if for a moment the heartbeat stops; for a moment time stops,
mind stops, everything stops; you are in a complete nothingness. And
then you feel great beauty, great joy.</p><p>Of course you logically think it is coming from the beautiful sunset
-- it is not so. The beautiful sunset may have functioned as a
triggering point. It may have triggered a process in you but it is not
the cause of it.</p><p>And once you understand that there is no cause to it , you can simply
close your eyes and you can fall into deep silence any moment. That's
what meditation is all about: creating a situation independent of the
outside world. No sunset is needed, no beautiful full-moon is needed, no
beautiful woman or man is needed, no roses</p><p>, no lotuses are needed. Nothing is needed because you have found
that these are only triggering points -- and it can be done by
yourself.</p><p><a href=part5 class=a>Just by becoming attuned to the inner, you
immediately hear something, you immediately become full of something
which cannot be expressed in any word</a>s whatsoever. It remains
unexpressed, inexpressible. But love comes closest to it.</p><p>So remember, love has to become the music of your life.</p><h1 style=padding-top:3pt;text-indent:0;text-align:center id=table-of-contents>Table of Contents</h1><p><u>Chapter title: None</u> <u>Chapter title: None</u> <u>Chapter

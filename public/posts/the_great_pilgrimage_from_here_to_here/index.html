WHAT CAN I DO ABOUT IT?</p><p>Prem Kabir, it is one of the human weaknesses, one of the deep-rooted
frailties, to seek attention.</p><p>The reason one seeks attention is because one does not know oneself.
It is only in other people's eyes one can see his face, in their
opinions he can find his personality. What they say matters immensely.
If they neglect him, ignore him, he feels lost. If you pass by and
nobody takes any attention, you will start losing what you have put
together -- your personality. It is something that you have put
together. You have not discovered it, it is not natural. It is very
artificial and very arbitrary.</p><p>It is not only you who is a beggar for attention; almost everybody
is. And the situation cannot change until you discover your authentic
self -- which does not depend on anybody's opinion, attention,
criticism, indifference, which does not have anything to do with anybody
else. Because very few people have been able to discover their reality,
the whole world is full of beggars.</p><p>Deep down you are all trying to find attention; it is nourishment for
your personality.</p><p>Even if people condemn you, criticize you, are against you, that is
acceptable, at least they are paying attention to you; if they are
friendly, respectful, of course that is far better, but you cannot
survive as a personality without some kind of attention. It can be
negative, it can be positive, it doesn't matter. People must say
something about you; respectful or disrespectful, both fulfill the same
purpose.</p><p>I would like you to think about the word `respect'. It does not mean
honor, as it is said in all the dictionaries without exception. Respect
simply means looking again, re-spect.</p><p>When you are passing by on the road, somebody looks back again, you
have caught his eye -- you are somebody. Because respect gives you the
idea of being somebody special, you can do anything stupid just to get
attention.</p><p>In all the ages people have tried in a thousand and one ways to get
attention. Those ways are not necessarily rational -- for example, the
punks in the West. What are they really wanting by cutting their hair in
strange and weird ways, and then painting it with different psychedelic
colors? What are they wanting? They are beggars. You should not be angry
with them because that is what they want. You should not condemn them
because that is what they want. Their parents should not criticize them
because that is what they want. They cannot survive without people
paying attention to them.</p><p>People have done all kinds of things you may not believe in the past.
People have remained naked.… What was the need for Mahavira or Diogenes
to be naked? It is no longer natural for man to be naked in all the
seasons; he lost that capacity long ago. All animals are naked, but they
have a natural immunity. When it is winter their hair grows, when it is
hot summer their hair falls. Nature has given them a protection.</p><p>The same protection was available to man too, but man is intelligent
and can improve on nature. He found ways to cover his body according to
the seasons. Naturally his body lost the natural growth of hairs. Now,
to be naked... suddenly your body cannot create the mechanism to protect
you.</p><p>I know Mahavira or Diogenes are unique individuals, but I think they
were a little uncertain of their uniqueness. They fulfilled that
suspicion, that missing gap, by being naked, because you cannot avoid
giving attention to a naked person in a world where everybody is wearing
clothes. The naked person stands aloof. You cannot avoid... it is almost
irresistible to look at him, to ask, "What is the matter?"</p><p>But their nakedness became something spiritual; people started being
respectful just because they were naked. Now, nakedness is not a quality
or any qualification or any creativity; all the animals, all the birds,
all the trees are naked.</p><p>There are still Jaina monks in India, not more than twenty. They used
to be in thousands, but now to find that many stupid people is a little
difficult. One Jaina monk dies and is not replaced, so their number goes
on falling. Only twenty people all over India are still naked -- and I
have seen many of them; they don't show any sign of intelligence, they
don't show any quality of silence, they don't show any joy. Their faces
are sad, dull, sleepy. They are suffering, they are</p><p>torturing themselves, just for the simple reason that it brings the
attention of the people.</p><p>Anything, howsoever stupid, is possible for man if it can bring
attention to him. In Russia before the revolution there was a Christian
sect which used to cut their genitals publicly on a particular day each
year -- and they had thousands of followers. Their only qualification
for being spiritual was that they had cut their genitals. When the day
arrived, they would gather in a church courtyard and they would cut
their genitals and pile them up. And thousands of people would come to
see this stupidity.</p><p>The women were not left behind... of course they were in a difficulty
because they don't have hanging genitals to cut; their genitals are
inwards. They started cutting their breasts</p><p>-- they were not ready to be left behind. It was such a messy and
bloody affair, but people were touching their feet, worshiping them, and
all that they have done is just an ugly act against nature and against
themselves.</p><p>What is significant if a man goes on a fast? Mahatma Gandhi used the
strategy his whole life: It was nothing but catching the attention of
the whole nation. And if he was going to fast unto death, the whole
world's attention was immediately caught. Otherwise there is no
spirituality in fasting: millions die starving. Millions are going to
die in the coming ten, twelve years from starvation. Nobody will give
any honor or respect to them. Why?</p><p>Because their starvation is inevitable. They are not starving
wilfully but because they don't have food; they are simply poor and
starving people.</p><p>But Mahatma Gandhi had everything available to him, although he lived
like a poor man.</p><p>One of his intimate followers, a very intelligent woman, Sarojini
Naidu -- has a statement on record that to keep Mahatma Gandhi poor they
had to spend treasures on him. It was not a simple poverty, it was a
managed show.</p><p>He would not drink the milk from a buffalo because it is rich, rich
with vitamin A and other vitamins. He would not drink the milk of a cow
because that too is rich, and poor people cannot afford it. He would
drink only the milk of a goat, because that is the cheapest animal and
poor people can afford it. But you will be</p><p>surprised: his goat was being washed twice a day with Lux toilet
soap! His goat's food consisted of the richest nourishment that any rich
man may feel jealous of. It is such an insane world! The goat was given
the milk of a cow to drink. Cashew nuts, apples and other nourishing
fruits were her only food; she was not living on grass. Her daily food
in those old days cost ten rupees per day; that ten rupees per day in
those days was enough for a man to live for a whole month.</p><p>And Gandhi was traveling third class. Naturally, he was attracting
attention -- a great man is traveling third class! But nobody saw that
the third class compartment, which could have carried sixty people at
least, was carrying only a single man; it is far more costly than the
air-conditioned compartment. But it attracted attention.</p><p>He started using clothes just like the farmers of India -- they are
eighty percent of the people in the country. Because he was using
farmer's clothes -- the upper body is naked, only the lower body has a
small piece of cloth to wrap around -- the poor people of this country
became immensely respectful and started calling him Mahatma, the great
soul.</p><p>But I have been looking into his life as deeply as possible. I don't
find any great soul; I have not found even a little soul -- just pure
politics in the name of religion. Knowing perfectly well that India can
be impressed only by religion, he was doing devotional songs every day
in the morning and in the evening, but it was all to attract
attention.</p><p>Attention gives you tremendous nourishment for the ego. And there are
instances... his secretary -- private secretary, Mahadeo Desai -- has
written a whole diary of the many years that he spent with Mahatma
Gandhi as his secretary. Many times there are mentions about J.
Krishnamurti, with such sarcastic remarks that one cannot believe that
Mahatma Gandhi had any insight into meditation or awareness: otherwise
he cannot be sarcastic.</p><p>You can criticize, but criticism needs understanding. You can say
Krishnamurti is not right, but then you have to give evidence -- on what
grounds? But just to laugh and giggle when Krishnamurti's name was
mentioned... Krishnamurti was saying, "I am the awakened one; you also
have the capacity to be an awakened one," and that was making Mahatma
Gandhi laugh sarcastically.</p><p>Meher Baba, another man of the same caliber as J. Krishnamurti, gave
a</p><p>telegram to Mahatma Gandhi saying, "You have been in search of God,
you have written your autobiography and titled it EXPERIMENTS WITH
TRUTH, but you don't know anything of meditation, of silence. If you are
really interested I can come to you and I can make you aware of the
dimension of meditation." And the whole gang that was around Mahatma
Gandhi laughed -- "This fellow thinks that he is God himself." And
Mahatma Gandhi replied, "I will do my own search; you need not trouble
to come here."</p><p>A third time it happened. One man of the name Kedarnath was of the
same caliber as J.</p><p>Krishnamurti, but was not world known. He was not a man of words but
a man of silence, peace. He stayed in Mahatma Gandhi's ashram, and soon
the pendulum started moving towards him. The disciples of Mahatma Gandhi
by and by started deserting him. In his morning devotional songs, the
number of people was declining: they were going to sit in silence with
Kedernath.</p><p>Finally it became such a situation: the ashram was Mahatma Gandhi's,
Kedarnath was just a guest, but he captured almost all Gandhi's
disciples. Gandhi was left alone, but his ego would not allow him to go
and sit where all his disciples were sitting -- in silence with
Kedarnath. It was with great humanity and compassion that Kedarnath left
the ashram in the middle of the night just to avoid a clash, because now
it was becoming clear that Mahatma Gandhi had lost control of his own
disciples. Kedarnath did not want to create any conflict.</p><p>Sri Aurobindo had a certain clarity. He was not an enlightened man of
the category of J.</p><p>Krishnamurti or Meher Baba, but he was very close. Perhaps one life
more and he will be enlightened; he was just on the border line. He
declared, "India will become free, will attain freedom on my birthday"
-- and it actually happened. The fifteenth of August is Sri Aurobindo's
birthday, and he had declared it thirty years before. People had
completely forgotten about his declaration, but India became free on the
fifteenth of August.</p><p>Sri Aurobindo sent a message to Mahatma Gandhi, "Now that the country
is free, you need a complete program for its progress, because it is one
thing to fight for freedom and it is another thing after attaining the
freedom to create a nation; tremendous responsibility falls on your
shoulders."</p><p>And the reply that Mahatma Gandhi gave was again simply sarcastic:
"You have left the world; you live in your ashram. You don't have to
worry about what happens to freedom and what we are going to do; that is
our business. You have left it, you don't have to interfere."</p><p>Now a man like Sri Aurobindo could have given insight, but that
insight was not accepted</p><p>-- and it shows. In those forty years that have passed since freedom,
India has become worse every day. It has no program; its population has
doubled, more than doubled. Its poverty has doubled -- the poverty grows
according to the population. By the end of this century, India will be
for the first time in the whole history of mankind, of millions of
years, the most densely populated country. Up to now, China has been the
first. So only one achievement seems to have come out of forty years of
freedom: people have produced more and more children.</p><p>By the end of this century, just thirteen years away, India will have
one billion people in the country. When it became free it had only four
hundred million people. It seems that each year there is an increase of
one million people -- but no technology is growing, no science is
growing, no new methods are being used. And this population growth goes
on making the country poorer and poorer. India is living on loans from
the rich countries like America, and that is a new kind of slavery,
economic slavery.</p><p>The days of political slavery are past, because it was unnecessary.…
It is a similar case: the days of slaves are past, and the days of
servants have come in because the slave was a great responsibility to
the slaveowner. He had to take care of the slave's health, he had to
take care of his body, food, clothes, his medicine, because he was an
investment. He has purchased the man, and if he dies his whole
investment is gone.</p><p>Slavery disappeared not because slaves revolted against it; there is
no instance of slaves revolting. Slavery died because the people who
were enslaving other people found better ways -- servants. You are not
purchased; hence it is not an investment. If you die, you die; it is not
a loss to the owner. He pays you, but he has no concern for your body,
for your health, for your family. This was far better.</p><p>The same has happened in the world of freedom. The British Empire
disappeared, all other empires have disappeared, because political
slavery became costly, very costly. It was the responsibility of the
rulers to feed people, at least.</p><p>The moment Britain saw that India is growing so fast in population
that it will be impossible to feed the people, and the whole
responsibility will be on the head of Britain, Atlee sent to Mountbatten
an urgent message: "You finish the whole thing before 1948, and if you
can do it earlier I will praise you. Whatever way has to be found, be
quick, and let them be free. Because then the whole responsibility will
be on their own heads. They cannot complain, `Britain is exploiting us;
that's why we are poor.'"</p><p>Now nobody is exploiting you, and your poverty has grown much greater
than it has ever been under slavery.</p><p>Politicians can pretend to be religious if religion is attractive.
Because they need attention their whole personality is false. It depends
on how many people are following them; it depends on the number of
people who are attentive to them. It is a politics of numbers.</p><p>The Catholic pope is against birth control, against abortion, not
because he is compassionate, saying, "This is absolute cruelty and
violence," not because he is life-affirmative -- the whole Catholic
attitude is life-negative, it is against life. Then why this insistence
that there should be no birth control and no abortion? Because this is
the only way to increase the number of Catholics, and this is the only
way to make other people so poor that they have to come under the fold
of the Catholic empire.</p><p>Now that there are so many orphans in India, Catholics have a good
opportunity. And one wonders... a woman like Mother Teresa is awarded a
Nobel prize, is awarded many doctorates in India by Indian universities,
is awarded prizes by the Indian government, all because she is taking
care of orphans. But nobody thinks that that care simply means
converting those orphans into Catholics. Naturally Mother Teresa cannot
be in favor of birth control -- from where will she get the orphans?</p><p>Christianity cannot be in favor of a world which is rich. The
scientists are declaring continually that we have come to such a point
of technological</p><p>progress that now there is no need for anybody to be hungry, to be
starving or dying because of shortage of food. It has never before been
possible, but now scientists are saying that we can feed five billion
people very easily, we can feed even more -- but those voices are
silenced. No politician pays any attention, because politicians are also
interested in having a big following.</p><p>In India Mohammedans will not be ready to accept that you should not
marry four women... which is simply a human matter. But they have made
it a point that it is a religious matter. I cannot understand how it is
religious to marry four women. And if it is religious to marry four,
then it will be doubly religious to marry eight. Perhaps that's why
Mohammed himself married nine women. The reality is that four women can
produce four children in the year; vice-versa will not help. One woman
marrying four men will still produce one child, not four children. But
one man marrying a number of women can produce more children.</p><p>You will be surprised to know that India has already been divided in
the name of religion, and Mohammedans have taken Pakistan on one side,
and Bangladesh on another side; the country has been cut into three
parts. Now again Mohammedans are growing so much that India is the
greatest Mohammedan country in the world. No Mohammedan country has so
many Mohammedans as India has. Any day they can start demanding a
separate country, because they are second in number to Hindus, and
Hindus are not a converting religion. Mohammedans are a converting
religion, forcibly too. There is no need of any argument; the sword is
the argument!</p><p>Your so-called religious leaders, your so-called political leaders,
all need attention, all need their names and their photos continually in
the newspapers, because if newspapers forget anybody's name for a few
months, people forget that man also. Now what do you know about Richard
Nixon? Where is that poor fellow? One day he was the greatest, most
powerful man on the earth, and now you will only hear about him the day
he dies, and that too will be on the third, fourth page of the
newspapers in a small column. What happens to these powerful people?
When they lose people's attention, their personality starts
disappearing.</p><p>I have known many political leaders in this country. Perhaps this
country has more ex-ministers, chief ministers, governors than any other
country. Once they become "ex" they are finished. Then nobody pays any
attention to them, nobody asks them to inaugurate bridges, railway
lines, hospitals, schools. No paper even</p><p>bothers where they are, whether they are alive or dead. And there was
a time when they were in the newspapers every day, on the radios, on
television.</p><p>One of my sannyasins works in the Indian television. She wanted to
bring a small piece from my talks every day to the television. The
director said, "We can accept the material, but we cannot mention Osho's
name."</p><p>She said, "But this is absolutely illegal, and it is stealing."</p><p>But the director said, "You should not mention his name at all " --
because that's what the Indian politicians want, and that's what the
politicians of the whole world want.</p><p>The Attorney General of America has emphatically declared in a press
conference, "Our whole effort will be to silence Osho's voice
completely."</p><p>One reporter asked, "What does it mean? Do you want to assassinate
him?"</p><p>And the Attorney General laughed. He said, "No, we will find some
roundabout ways so he is not heard any more."</p><p>The American government is pressurizing the Indian government so that
no foreign news media will be allowed to reach me. And I am receiving
letters from Germany, from America, from Greece, from England, from
Australia, "What is the matter? Why is the Indian government absolutely
stubborn that they don't want any news media, newspapers, radio, or
television people to come to Poona?"</p><p>This is the way, in their eyes, to silence me. They are wrong. I have
my own ways: I have my own people who are enough... just person to
person. If a man like Gautam Buddha, without any television, without any
newspapers, without any radio, could convert the whole of Asia, what is
the problem? I am not dependent on their news media.</p><p>But the fear of the politicians is... the whole media attention
should be focused on them --</p><p>and why are people asking to go to Poona? Why don't they ask to come
to Delhi? That hurts them very badly.</p><p>It is not only your problem, that you are a beggar for attention; it
is a human reality. And the reason is that you depend on your
personality -- which is false, which has been created by the society,
and which can be taken away by society. Don't depend on it. It is not in
your power.</p><p>That which is in your power is your own individuality. Discover it!
And the name of the science to discover it is meditation.</p><p>Once you know yourself, you don't care about others. Even if the
whole world forgets you it does not matter, it does not even make the
slightest difference to you; or the whole world can know -- that too
does not give you any ego. You know ego is false, and to depend on the
false is to make houses on the sand, without foundation. Your
personalities are almost signatures on water. You have not even signed,
and they disappear.</p><p>A group of Jewish mothers were drinking coffee together, and bragging
about their children. One had a four-year-old who could read already.
Another had a five-year-old who had already appeared on television. Then
Becky Goldberg spoke up and said, "That's nothing. You should see my
little Hymie. He is only five years old, but the other day he went to
the psychiatrist all by himself!"</p><p>A middle-aged woman confessed to her priest that she was becoming
vain. "Why do you think so?" asked the priest.</p><p>"Because," replied the woman, "every time I look in the mirror I am
inspired by my beauty."</p><p>"Don't worry," said the priest, "that's not a sin, that's only a
mistake!"</p><p>It was a big meeting of the medical society in honor of an ear
specialist who was retiring after more than fifty years of service. As a
gift, they presented him with a golden ear. He stood up to make a
speech, and after the applause had died down, he looked at his gift and
said, "Thank god I was not a gynecologist!"</p><p>Don't depend on others!</p><p>Be independent in your being. Just listen to your inner voice.</p><p>You can listen the moment you start stilling and silencing your mind
-- and it is not difficult. And when I say it is not difficult, I say it
with absolute authority: It is not difficult! If it has happened to me,
it can happen to you -- there is no difference. All human beings are
potentially capable to know themselves. And the moment you know
yourself, then nobody can take away your individuality. Even if they
kill you, they can only kill your body, not you.</p><p>When Socrates was poisoned, the chief judge said to him, "I feel
sorry that I had to agree with the majority. They all wanted to kill
you. And you are such a strange fellow... I gave you three alternatives,
but you did not accept."</p><p>The chief judge had tremendous respect, but what to do? The majority
was shouting, "He should be killed because he is corrupting our youth.
He is giving them ideas which are against our tradition, against our
religion. He is making them skeptical of the old and the ancient. He is
making them explore the reality on their own, and not just believe in
knowledge and ancient scriptures. He is destroying our tradition. We
don't want this man; this man should be destroyed."</p><p>But the chief judge understood the whole situation. He said to
Socrates... because in those days in Greece there were city states;
Athens was a city state and the Athenian law was not applicable outside
Athens. So he said, "The first simple choice is, you just move out of
Athens, just outside the boundary line, and there you can make your
school, your academy. Those who want to learn will come there."</p><p>Socrates said, "That will show my fear of death... and some day I am
going to die, I am old enough. These people are too impatient; I will
die by myself. So to escape from Athens just for a few years... my being
does not support such an idea. I cannot act out of fear. I would rather
accept death, because you can only kill my body but not my spirit.</p><p>And the body is going to die anyway, any moment!"</p><p>The chief judge said, "The second alternative is if you promise not
to talk about truth, to stop teaching, you can live in Athens."</p><p>He said, "Then what will be the point of living? To me, truth is
higher than life. Life comes and goes; truth remains. No, I cannot
accept that."</p><p>The chief judge said, "Then the last thing is that you can say, Ì am
sorry that I</p><p>have hurt people's feelings.' Just a simple apology will make me
stand in your favor, and you can be saved from this ugly act of
poisoning you to death."</p><p>Socrates said, "That is not possible, because I have not done
anything wrong. I cannot say I am sorry. I can only say I am immensely
happy, and the question of an apology does not arise. For centuries you
all will be condemned because you poisoned me. And one thing I would
like you to know is that your name will be remembered only because you
gave the judgment for my death; otherwise, nobody will remember
you."</p><p>This is the man of individuality, who does not care for his life, for
his body, who has no fear. He accepted death with joy.</p><p>An individual is the only person who can get rid of this state of
begging; otherwise you are going to remain a beggar your whole life. And
in subtle ways you are continuously begging. Every young man falling in
love with a woman will ask the woman, "Am I the first man you have
fallen in love with?" It is almost inevitable. And every woman will ask,
"Am I the first woman you have fallen in love with?" Why such questions?
The woman wants you never to have paid attention to anybody: "I am the
first, the most beautiful woman in your eyes."</p><p>Man all through history has insisted that he will marry only a virgin
-- for what? It is such a stupid idea, because a virgin is absolutely
inexperienced. You should insist, "I should marry someone who has some
experience." This is simple, logical, rational and scientific.</p><p>But all the societies have insisted that they will accept in marriage
only a virgin girl.</p><p>In the middle ages there were doctors in Europe... because the
woman's virginity can be judged, checked. There is a very thin layer of
skin -- if she has not been in a sexual relationship, that skin remains
intact; if she has been in a sexual relationship, that skin is broken.
That broken skin proves that she is not a virgin. Now sometimes it can
be broken just by riding on a bicycle, it can be broken by riding on a
horse, it can be broken by any accident -- falling from the staircase.
It is not something that can be broken only by making love. But every
young man was alert on his first night as to whether the woman was
virgin or not, so there were doctors in Europe who used to fix a false
skin to make anybody virgin!</p><p>Their profession was flourishing greatly.</p><p>I was in Greece, and I asked one of my sannyasins, "In Greece is
virginity immensely valued by the orthodox church of Greece?" And the
sannyasin I was asking had been one of the most beautiful women, one
time chosen as Miss Greece.</p><p>She laughed. She said, "The church goes on saying that virginity is
our fundamental principle, but it is very difficult to find a virgin in
Greece!" But before getting married, they become virgin. It is just a
very small thing for a gynecologist to fix a thin layer of skin.</p><p>I have heard one priest was asking and thundering and threatening the
people of his congregation, "If you are not virgin, you will suffer
hellfire. So all women who are virgin, or who have been virgin before
their marriage, stand up!" Nobody stood up. He said, "I say again..."
One woman with a little baby stood up. He said, "I am happy at least one
woman has followed the religious principle of the Greek orthodox
church."</p><p>The woman said, "Forgive me Father, I am not standing for myself; I
am standing for the baby. You cannot expect a six-month-old baby to
stand by herself! She is certainly a virgin, I can guarantee it!"</p><p>All kinds of stupid notions have prevailed in humanity. And you have
to follow these notions if you want attention. In India, if you want to
have attention... There was a man in Mahatma Gandhi's ashram, and he was
an intelligent man. He had been a professor, a retired professor,
Professor Ranga. He lived for six months only on cow dung and cow urine
-- just these two things for six months -</p><p>- and he became more of an attraction than Mahatma Gandhi himself.
Everybody who was coming to the ashram was going to see Professor Ranga.
Even Mahatma Gandhi called him a great man, a great spiritual man! I
don't see how cow dung can make a man spiritual. It simply can prove
that he is stupid.</p><p>But in Hindu society where the cow is accepted as the mother, the
holy mother, this is a great spiritual attainment.</p><p>All over the world you will find the same kind of superstitions in
different ways. And if you want the attention of people, you have to
follow their ideas. You have always to be a follower, you have always to
be a believer, you have always to be stupid and idiotic.</p><p>But if you want to get rid of this begging, you will have to get rid
of your ego and your personality. You will have to learn that there is
nothing in respect, there is nothing in reputation, there is nothing in
respectability. They are all bogus words, meaningless, contentless. The
reality belongs to you, but unless you discover it, you will have to
depend on others.</p><p>You are emperors, but you have to discover yourself. And this
discovery is not difficult:</p><p>Your kingdom is within you.</p><p>You just have to learn to close your eyes and look inwards. A little
discipline, a little learning not to remain focused on the outside
continuously, but to turn inwards at least once or twice a day, whenever
you can find time... slowly, slowly you start becoming aware of your
eternal being. Then the idea of attention simply disappears.</p><p>And the miracle is: the day you don't need anybody's attention,
people start feeling your charisma, because charisma is the radiation of
your individuality. They start feeling that you are somebody special,
unique -- although they cannot pinpoint where your uniqueness is, what
it is that attracts like a magnet.</p><p>People who have discovered themselves have found thousands of people
attracted towards them, but they are not asking for it.</p><p>Question 2 BELOVED MASTER,</p><p>HOW CAN HYPNOSIS AND MEDITATION COME TOGETHER?</p><p>Amrit Nirjan, hypnosis has been condemned by all kinds of ignorant
people. They don't understand anything about it, but you will find
people everywhere condemning it. The word is used without knowing even
the meaning of it. People will say to you, "You are hypnotized, that's
why you go to Osho!" But just ask them what hypnosis is. They cannot
even tell you the literal meaning of it, nor can they tell you what is
the technique of it.</p><p>Just the word is enough to condemn anybody, "You are hypnotized."</p><p>Hypnosis is a tremendously beautiful art, and there is nothing wrong
in it. But everything can be used in a wrong way or in a right way. You
can have a sword and cut somebody's head. That is not the fault of the
sword; the sword is neutral. With your sword you can prevent somebody
from raping a woman. But the sword is absolutely neutral, neither good
nor bad; every energy is neutral.</p><p>Hypnosis is a tremendous source of energy. The word itself means
deliberate sleep. You know ordinary sleep, you sleep every day; because
it is ordinary sleep, it does not go deep enough. Its function is to
help your body to recover its energy lost in the day-to-day work, so
tomorrow morning you can get up fresh, again able to work. The ordinary
sleep only goes so deep that it can help your body to recover,
rejuvenate.</p><p>Deliberate sleep is the meaning of hypnosis. It is a simple thing,
but it goes as deep as you are ready to go. It refreshes your body, it
silences your mind, it cleanses your heart, it can reach to your very
being. It all depends on your willingness -- nobody can hypnotize you
against your will. That also is a greatly fallacious idea prevalent in
the world, that somebody can hypnotize you against your will. That is
impossible. Nobody can hypnotize you against your will.</p><p>Simple methods are used by the hypnotist. He will tell you to relax
and concentrate on something shiny, without moving your eyelids; just
keep your eyes open as long as you can, and only when it is almost
impossible for you, when the eyelids close by themselves</p><p>-- you cannot do anything, you cannot stop -- only then... You are
relaxed, lying down in a silent place, looking at a very strong light
which tires the eyes, staring at it. The hypnotist is repeating, "Your
eyelids are becoming very heavy, the light is too strong and you are
going to fall asleep soon." And he will go on repeating it.</p><p>It takes not more than three to five minutes before you will start
feeling your eyelids have become heavier, and heavier, and heavier. And
a moment comes when you cannot keep them open, they simply close. Then
the hypnotist starts telling you, "You are going deeper, deeper. And you
will hear only my voice and nothing else." Your total willingness is
needed. If you are reluctant, if you don't want it, then the hypnotist
is absolutely helpless. It is not a power of the hypnotist as it is
understood in the world, it is the willingness of the hypnotized that
brings that deep kind of deliberate sleep.</p><p>If you follow, cooperate with the hypnotist, he can take you deeper,
deeper, deeper... the mind has become silent. And the moment he says
anything, it simply sinks into your being. Your heart is dancing with
harmony -- no tension, no thought. You have entered into the innermost
shrine of your being; now relax there.</p><p>But this is possible only, and I am saying categorically only, if you
are willing to go into it. But it is tremendously helpful, because you
find it very difficult on your own to go into that deep silence where
the world is left far behind. And if the hypnosis is going to be used
for meditative purposes... It can be used for many kinds of purposes, it
can be used for healing.</p><p>Seventy percent of your diseases are just mind diseases, they are not
really there. You simply believe they are there, and because you
believe, they are there. It is because of this there are so many
`pathies': allopathy, homeopathy, naturopathy, ayurveda, unani. There
are so many `pathies', Chinese, Japanese... and all function perfectly
well, but only for seventy percent.</p><p>Only allopathy is a scientific methodology; it functions on one
hundred percent of your diseases. But every pathy... homeopathy is
nothing but sugar pills, but it works, and the work is not small --
seventy percent. For seventy percent of sicknesses it is perfectly good.
Naturopathy works, and naturopathy is very simple, for example, having a
mud bath. Fill your bathtub with mud and lie down in the mud, and it
cures many things. It has been found that seventy percent of diseases
are in your own hands.</p><p>I had a doctor who was a fake doctor. He was my friend. He had no
degrees, but his board was full of degrees -- all kinds of degrees, from
inside India, from outside India.</p><p>And he made a lab. As you entered into his clinic, first you would
pass through a tremendous lab, which was all just bogus -- great
machines that you have never seen, which have nothing to do with
medicine -- and he would impress you in this way.</p><p>When you reached his office you would be surprised. He never used an
ordinary stethoscope; he had a very special arrangement. He was a genius
although he was a fake.</p><p>But he was a genius! You would have to lie down on the table, and
above your</p><p>head there were many big bottles with colored water, joined with a
tube. That tube he would attach to the stethoscope, and the water would
jump. You would see the water jumping --</p><p>whether red water is jumping or green water is jumping. You have
never seen such a thing!</p><p>It created great trust in the man: "That man is not ordinary." And he
was just watching the water...! That could have been done by anybody, by
an ordinary stethoscope; it was nothing... your heart is jumping, so the
water is jumping. Everything was special! He had almost cured the person
by the time he was out of his clinic, and he was simply giving water,
colored water, to people.</p><p>He was caught by the police. As I heard that he had been caught, I
went immediately to the police station and I told those people, "He is
fake, but he has helped hundreds of people -- you should also consider
that. It is absolutely unjust to harass him. It is true that those
degrees are false, but those degrees are not given by any university,
any medical college; so what is wrong if he has used the alphabet and he
has made his degrees himself? Your concern should be how many people he
has helped. And those are the people whom nobody could help."</p><p>People used to go to him only as a last resort, because his fees were
very high. Naturally, he had such a great establishment, his fees were
almost eight times more than any qualified doctor. And he said to me,
"Even taking eight times the fees helps the patient.</p><p>When he pays so much, he gets well quickly. When he pays so much, he
believes that the doctor is not ordinary. So it is not only a question
of getting more money, it is a question of helping the patient. It is
part of treatment."</p><p>But the police were not ready to listen to me; he was presented
before the magistrate. I went there too, and I said, "You should look at
the record of how many people he cures.</p><p>And those are the incurable people. They have been to allopathy, they
have been to ayurveda, they have been to homeopathy. Nothing helps, but
this man manages to help them. Now the real criterion should be how much
service, how much help he has given, but you are simply bothering about
certificates."</p><p>The magistrate said, "I can understand you, but I have to follow the
law."</p><p>So the poor doctor is behind the bars. But I was continually talking
to him, and he was very open and clear. He said, "I have arranged this
whole thing as a hypnotic strategy.</p><p>Once the patient is hypnotized, is ready to cooperate with me, once
he trusts me... and he has to trust because he has paid so much money,
and he has to trust because I am the last resort. He has been to all
kinds of doctors. If I fail, then he has no hope, so naturally he has to
trust me. And he can see that it is not an ordinary doctor's clinic. It
is so extraordinary that it is impossible for the doctor to fail."</p><p>If somebody is not willing, the hypnotist has to create the
willingness. Hypnotism is not some power in the hands of the hypnotist.
That idea I want to criticize absolutely, without any conditions
attached to it. It is thought all over the world that it is a power in
the hands of the hypnotist. It is not; it is your power.</p><p>The hypnotist is only a help to awaken you to your own power, and
then it can be used for many things: for healing, for making you live
longer, for changing your harmful habits, smoking, drinking. It can do
tremendous work.</p><p>It can be used as an educative methodology. You can learn in hypnosis
better than you can learn ordinarily, because everything is silent and
you are hearing only one voice.</p><p>Even if somebody else comes and talks, you will not hear, you are
open only to a small narrow way to the hypnotist. He can teach you any
new language. He can teach you any new science. He can teach you
arithmetic, anything within minutes for which people take hours and days
to learn.</p><p>And it can be used for meditation too. As far as I am concerned
hypnosis is simply a relaxed, deliberate sleep with a small opening, a
little window, to the person who hypnotized you. He can tell you that
your meditation will go deeper every day, and if this thought gets in
your unconscious, your meditation will start going deeper. Just a few
sessions and he can give you the last post-hypnotic suggestion: now you
don't need any hypnosis; your meditation will go deeper on its own
accord.</p><p>Hypnosis has not been used in the whole of history for meditation,
but it can be used, and it can be used with tremendous power, because
you have to fight so</p><p>much with your thoughts unnecessarily. That whole struggle with your
mind can be dropped by hypnotic sessions without much effort.</p><p>Hypnosis is also capable of giving you a post-hypnotic suggestion, if
you want to hypnotize yourself, by a simple strategy: count from one to
one hundred, and from one hundred back to one. By the time you have
reached back to one, you will fall into deep hypnosis. And you can tell
yourself before going into hypnosis</p><p>-- because you will be alone -- "The state of hypnosis will last only
for fifteen minutes. After fifteen minutes I will come out of it." This
is auto-hypnosis.</p><p>Hetero-hypnosis means somebody is helping you. In the beginning it is
good to take help.</p><p>But you have to be very willing, in a very loveful atmosphere.</p><p>An old man was torturing his family continuously with this disease,
that disease. And he was reading the encyclopedia and finding diseases.
He was reading medical magazines and finding new diseases that have just
been discovered, and he would immediately start torturing his family, "I
am suffering from this disease." It was a way of remaining in power. He
was retired. Nobody cared about him; in fact, he was a burden. But even
if you are a burden, you don't want to be neglected. His method not to
be neglected and not to be ignored was to create new diseases.</p><p>Doctors were tired because they said, "That man is strange, he has no
disease. He just goes on reading and finding diseases from
encyclopedias, and then we have to treat something which he has not got
-- and that may unnecessarily create trouble." Medicine which is given
to a person who has no disease may cause some trouble, particularly
allopathic medicines which are almost all based on poison. So the
doctors were saying,</p><p>"We are tired, just..."</p><p>Then one doctor said, "It will be good if you go to a hypnotist. I
have a friend who is a very good hypnotist, perhaps he may be helpful."
Now the old man is saying that he is suffering from sleeplessness, so
the hypnotist will be perfectly the right person. He will give him
sleep. He will also give him the the post- hypnotic suggestion, "You
will go to sleep -- just drink hot milk before you go to bed and
immediately you will fall asleep."</p><p>He will associate sleep with the hot milk, and once it gets
associated in the mind, it works.</p><p>Every child knows that the teddy bear works; you take the teddy bear
away, and the child cannot sleep. And everybody has his own methods of
creating teddy bears. You will find somebody clutching his blanket. If
you don't allow him to clutch his blanket, he cannot sleep. Everybody
has a certain posture of sleeping. If you don't allow him that posture,
he cannot sleep. These are natural ways of auto-hypnotizing
yourself.</p><p>So the hypnotist was brought, and the old man was told, "Now you
forget... all your diseases will be finished. We have found the greatest
hypnotist." The old man lay down, and the hypnotist said, "Just as I say
you are falling asleep, asleep... and your eyelids are becoming heavy,
so heavy, mountainously heavy so that you cannot keep them open... "</p><p>And soon the old man was fast asleep.</p><p>The doctor took away his bag, slipped silently out, took his fees,
and the family was very happy that this is the right man. But as the son
came back, the old man opened one eye and said, "Has that crank gone or
not?" He was not willing; he was just pretending.</p><p>Immediately the moment he said, "Your eyes are becoming heavy," he
closed his eyes, listened to the whole thing, and knew that this is
stupid. How can this create sleep?</p><p>Your willingness is absolutely needed. It is you who creates the
hypnosis, not the person who hypnotizes you. But it is good in the
beginning if you can help each other. There is nothing much to it;
anybody you trust can help you and take you deep into hypnosis. And when
you are in deep hypnosis he can check whether you are in deep hypnosis
or not. He can push a needle in your hand; you will not feel it. He can
take your hand up and leave it, and it will fall because you are not
awake and you cannot keep it that way. So there are just a few small
things he can try to find out if you are really in hypnosis.</p><p>Then he can tell you about meditation: whenever you sit to meditate,
take a bath, make a special room for your meditation. Don't do anything
in that room so that it remains vibrating with your meditativeness. Burn
incense, bring roses and flowers, sit silently.</p><p>Close your eyes, watch your thoughts and you will immediately go into
deep silence; thoughts will disappear. This can happen without hypnosis
but it takes a longer time.</p><p>Hypnosis is a short cut.</p><p>Your question is significant, Amrit Nirjan. You are asking, "How can
hypnosis and meditation come together?" They can come together very
easily. Hypnosis can be used for many purposes -- it can be used for
meditation. And the people who said you are being hypnotized by me are,
in a way, right. Just because I don't use methods of hypnotizing you,
that does not mean that hypnosis is not created by you.</p><p>I am not hypnotizing you, but you love me, you trust me -- that's
enough. And then when I stop for a moment, you also stop with me. When I
am not speaking... just a gap, and you are also in a gap. Slowly, slowly
your heart starts the same rhythm as my heart. My words start having a
certain music, a certain solacing, a certain relaxing quality. All
depends on love, all depends on trust, but you are creating it.</p><p>I am not hypnotizing -- I am not a hypnotist.</p><p>I don't need to be, I am myself. My presence is hypnotizing. So I
don't need to tell you,</p><p>"Lie down and I will move a crystal... ding-dong, ding-dong. You are
falling asleep, ding-dong.… " I have told you the story...</p><p>A sex maniac was being hypnotized by a ding-dong hypnotist, and the
sex maniac jumped; he said, "Doctor, it works! My ding-dong is
asleep!"</p><p>I am not a ding-dong hypnotist!...</p><p>I love you. I want to share my truth with you for no other reason
except that I am so full of it, I cannot contain it. I want to share; I
want to unburden myself. And if you are ready on the other end to
receive it, hypnosis will happen automatically. And with hypnosis,
because my insistence is continuously on meditation, you will find it
easier to meditate here with me than anywhere else -- in the beginning
at least.</p><p>Later on, when you have developed on your own and you are more
confident that you can fly in the silent spaces of your heart, then you
will be able to create the same state anywhere; I will not be
needed.</p><p>I don't want you to be addicted to me -- because I am not a drug, and
I don't want you to be addicted to anything. But you can use things
which have been condemned by ignorant people, not knowing what they are
saying. You can use them for tremendous benefit, for your spiritual
growth.</p><p>Just an innocent heart is needed for meditation. And hypnosis can
cleanse your heart and can bring you into the state of a small
child.</p><p>Little Roger was frightened of the large bulldog that occupied the
yard next to his home.</p><p>One day, feeling adventurous, Roger climbed the fence. The huge
bulldog rushed up to him and licked his face. The boy began to scream
and his mother came running to his side.</p><p>"Did he bite you, darling?"</p><p>"Not yet," whimpered Roger, "He just tasted me." That is the
simplicity of a child.</p><p>Old Sam Rosenbaum was seventy-five, really very old, and finally got
his nerve together to take a flight in a small airplane. As he climbed
out after the ride, he turned to the pilot and said, "Sir, I wish to
thank you for both those rides."</p><p>"What are you talking about?" said the pilot, "You had only one
ride." "Oh no I didn't," said old Sam. "I had two: my first and my
last!"</p><p>In old age also, if people have lived rightly they come back to the
same innocence of a child. And according to me, unless an old man
becomes again a child, he has missed the opportunity of growing in the
spiritual dimension; he has wasted his life in trivia. He has been
collecting only seashells and colored stones on the sea beach, but he
has not been able to discover the treasure of consciousness, awareness,
enlightenment.</p><p>Hypnosis can be certainly used. Here we are going to create a school
for hypnosis, where you will be able to learn how to auto-hypnotize
yourself so you don't have the dependence on the hypnotist. And then you
can use that auto- hypnotizing process for meditation.</p><p>This is a pioneer effort to bring hypnosis and meditation together
for the first time. But together they can be tremendously great. They
can bring you so much light, so much blissfulness -- and so easily. I
like to repeat Chuang Tzu's statement, "Easy is right; right is easy." I
don't want you to become unnecessarily self-torturing, following
unnecessarily long, arduous ways to come to yourself.</p><p>You don't have to go anywhere.</p><p>I want to teach you the great pilgrimage from here to here. I want
you to learn the art of reaching to God singing, dancing, rejoicing.</p><p>Laugh your way to God.</p><p>In essence that is my teaching.</p><p>And it is possible, with the help of hypnosis, to make meditation the
easiest process. But drop any idea of condemnation of hypnosis, which
you may have gathered because all the world, the whole world, is afraid
of being hypnotized. There have been people, highly intelligent, who
wanted to come to see me but they finally decided not to because they
were afraid they may be hypnotized. Nobody can hypnotize you against
your will.</p><p>Millions of people would like to come. They are reading my books,
they are listening to my tapes, they are seeing the videos, but they are
afraid to come close to me. A fear has been created by the so-called
religious leaders that they will be hypnotized.</p><p>It happened that one famous but ugly and pornographic magazine,
STERN, from Germany, had sent a reporter. He became so interested
because he wanted to write an inside story. So he meditated, he listened
to me, he did everything that sannyasins are doing here. He became so
joyful and blissful that he became a sannyasin! He wrote the story, he
went back. The STERN editorial board was very annoyed. The first thing
they said was, "You have been hypnotized. We cannot publish your
article. You have written it under hypnosis."</p><p>He said, "What nonsense you are talking!"</p><p>They did not publish his article. On the contrary, they fired him.
And they managed to distort his article the way they wanted: they left
out everything that was positive, they inserted their own
interpretations, and colored the whole thing in such an ugly and
negative way that even he was surprised, because when they fired him...
and he was one of their most important chief reporters.</p><p>He had come to live here, then he lived in the commune in America,
and I think soon he will be coming back. Wherever he will be, he will be
a sannyasin. He has tasted the experience himself. It is no more a
borrowed knowledge; it has entered into his being, but it is not
hypnosis.</p><p>He was wrongly understood, and he was wrongly condemned. Journalists
come, but they always are spectators. They will not know what is
happening to people in their inner being. Unless they become insiders,
their reports are worthless. Many other people come, just as spectators
to see what is happening.</p><p>This place is not for spectators.</p><p>This place is only for those who have courage to participate in this
tremendous experiment of consciousness awakening.</p><p>Okay, Vimal? Yes, Osho.</p><p>The Great Pilgrimage: From Here to Here Chapter #2</p><p>Chapter title: Be a joke unto yourself</p><p>7 September 1987 am in Gautam the Buddha Auditorium Archive</p><p>code: 8709070</p><p>ShortTitle:</p><p>PILGR02</p><p>Audio:</p><p>Yes Video:</p><p>Yes Length:</p><p>92</p><p>mins Question 1</p><p>BELOVED MASTER,</p><p>IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU ARE TRULY THE FIRST MAN THIS PLANET HAS</p><p>EVER KNOWN WHO REALLY UNDERSTANDS WOMEN AND ACCEPTS THEM.</p><p>PLEASE COMMENT.</p><p>Prem Bubula, I have told you that a woman is to be loved, not
understood. That is the first understanding.</p><p>Life is so mysterious that our hands cannot reach to its heights, our
eyes cannot look into its deepest mystery. Understanding any expression
of existence -- men or women or trees or animals or birds -- is the
function of science, not of a mystic. I am not a scientist. To me
science itself is a mystery, and now scientists have started to
recognize it -- they are dropping their old stubborn, superstitious
attitude that one day they will know all that is to be known.</p><p>With Albert Einstein the whole history of science has taken a very
different route</p><p>because the more he went into the deepest core of matter, the more he
became puzzled. All logic was left behind, all rationality was left
behind. You cannot dictate to existence, because it does not follow your
logic. Logic is man-made.</p><p>There was a point in Albert Einstein's life when he remembers that he
was wavering about whether to insist on being rational... but that would
be foolish. It would be human, but not intelligent. Even if you insist
on logic, on rationality, existence is not going to change according to
your logic; your logic has to change according to existence. And the
deeper you go, existence becomes more and more mysterious.</p><p>A point comes when you have to leave logic and rationality and just
listen to nature. I call it the ultimate understanding -- but not in the
ordinary sense of understanding. You know it, you feel it, but there is
no way to say it.</p><p>Man is a mystery, woman is a mystery, everything that exists is a
mystery -- and all our efforts to figure it out are going to fail.</p><p>I am reminded of a man who was purchasing in a toy shop a present for
his son for Christmas. He was a well-known mathematician, so naturally
the shopkeeper brought out a jigsaw puzzle. The mathematician tried...
it was a beautiful puzzle. He tried and tried and tried and started
perspiring. It was becoming awkward: the customers and the salesmen and
the shopkeeper were all watching and he has not been able to bring the
puzzle to a solution.</p><p>Finally he dropped the idea and he shouted at the shopkeeper: "I am a
mathematician and if I cannot solve this jigsaw puzzle, how do you think
my small boy will be able to?"</p><p>The shopkeeper said, "You don't understand. It is made in such a way
that nobody can solve it -- mathematician or no mathematician."</p><p>The mathematician asked, "But why is it made in this way?"</p><p>The shopkeeper said, "It is made in this way so that the boy from the
very beginning starts learning that life cannot be solved, cannot be
understood."</p><p>You can live it, you can rejoice in it, you can become one with the
mystery, but the idea of understanding as an observer is not at all
possible.</p><p>I don't understand myself. The greatest mystery to me is myself. But
a few clues I can give to you:</p><p>A psychiatrist is a fellow who asks you a lot of expensive questions
that your wife asks you for nothing.</p><p>The key to happiness: You may speak of love and tenderness and
passion, but real ecstasy is discovering you haven't lost your keys
after all.</p><p>Women begin by resisting a man's advances and end by blocking his
retreat. If you want to change a woman's mind, agree with her.</p><p>If you want to know what a woman really means, look at her -- don't
listen to her.</p><p>The lady walked up to the policeman and said, "Officer, that man on
the corner is annoying me."</p><p>"I have been watching the whole time," said the cop, "and that man
wasn't even looking at you."</p><p>"Well," said the woman, "isn't that annoying?"</p><p>The romantic young man turned to the beautiful young girl in his bed
and asked, "Am I the first man you ever made love to?"</p><p>She thought for a moment and then said, "You could be -- I have a
terrible memory for faces."</p><p>A young girl said to an old maid, "You must have missed a great deal
by not marrying!"</p><p>"Only the ceremony!" replied the old maid.</p><p>In the Garden of Eden, Eve was nagging Adam, as usual. "I saw you
playing around with another woman underneath the tree of knowledge last
night!" she screamed.</p><p>"But Eve," said Adam, "you know that there is only you and I here in
Eden!"</p><p>"Don't lie to me! I always know when you are lying!" Eve whined.
"Eve, listen! This is just a fantasy brought on by your menopause."</p><p>"Don't give me any psychological bullshit! I know what I saw!" Eve
roared. "Okay, okay, then if you don't believe me, just count my
ribs."</p><p>A man went on a safari with his wife and his mother-in-law. One day
he was lying morosely in his tent when he heard a cry from his wife. He
jumped up and rushed into the clearing. There, out in the open, he saw
mama-in-law shaking her fist at a huge lion who was standing five feet
away from her, ready to move.</p><p>"Do something!" pleaded his wife in alarm.</p><p>"Why should I?" retorted the frustrated hunter. "That lion got
himself into this mess -- let him get himself out of it!"</p><p>Everything is mysterious: it is better to enjoy it rather than trying
to understand it.</p><p>Ultimately the man who goes on trying to understand life proves to be
a fool, and the man who enjoys life becomes wise goes on enjoying life,
because he becomes more and more aware of the mysterious that surrounds
us.</p><p>The greatest understanding is to know that nothing can be understood,
that all is mysterious and miraculous. To me this is the beginning of
religion in your life.</p><p>Question 2 BELOVED MASTER,</p><p>I LOVE TO DO T'AI CHI AND IT HAS BECOME MY DAILY MEDITATION, BUT I
HAVE A TENDENCY TO BECOME TOO SERIOUS ABOUT IT. CAN YOU DRIVE</p><p>OUT THE MONKEY?</p><p>Anand Srajan, it is impossible for anybody to drive the monkey out of
your mind, because it does not exist; your seriousness is creating it.
And nobody can</p><p>change your seriousness either. It is your life attitude which is
making you serious. What is there to be serious about? Existence is a
continuous celebration, a festival that knows no holidays.</p><p>You are serious because for thousands of years people have been
telling you that the serious man is a better man, higher man, more
evolved than the nonserious. The nonserious have never been taken into
account.</p><p>But to me the situation is just the reverse. The nonserious one is
the one who will come to know the real life and its experiences.
Seriousness is closing you, making you hard, making you sad. Seriousness
comes from ambition, from desire which you are not being able to
attain.</p><p>But the religions have paid too much respect to seriousness. I have
never come across in any religious scripture of any religion -- and
there are three hundred religions on the earth</p><p>-- that anybody has paid respect to nonseriousness, to playfulness,
to a sense of humor.</p><p>They all make you dodos.</p><p>I have heard... one day as the bishop entered a church in New York,
he could not believe his eyes: he saw Jesus Christ standing there.</p><p>He said, "My god! I thought that prayers are never heard. I never
believed that there is any God or any son of God -- but what to do with
this fellow? Either he is a hippy or he is Jesus Christ. I am in
trouble."</p><p>He approached the man and asked, "Can I ask you who you are?"</p><p>And the man said, "You have been serving me, spreading my word, and
you don't recognize me!"</p><p>The bishop's heart started sinking: "My god! He is Jesus Christ! And
now there is bound to be trouble."</p><p>He phoned the pope in Rome: "What am I supposed to do? In our
teaching courses there is not even a single mention that `Jesus will
come one day to your church.' So what has to be done, what is the right
course? How should I</p><p>behave?"</p><p>The pope said, "Don't create trouble for me! It is good that he has
come to New York. Do two things: first, the most important, look serious
and busy. Who knows, he may be...</p><p>And second, don't forget to inform the police."</p><p>Religions have been teaching people to be serious because seriousness
creates a certain kind of dullness in your consciousness. Seriousness is
not a help. It is poisonous; nobody can take it away, unless you
understand... then it will disappear.</p><p>A psychiatrist and a friend were walking down the street, and a
stranger passing by suddenly kicked the psychiatrist in the shins. The
shrink walked on as if nothing had happened. His friend was astounded.
"Aren't you going to do anything about it?" he cried.</p><p>"Why should I?" asked the psychiatrist. "It's his problem."</p><p>If the monkey is there inside you, it is his problem! He must be
getting tortured with your seriousness and your t'ai chi. Don't be
worried. He himself will be trying to find a way to get out of the
mess.</p><p>A man who is playful does not bother about things like t'ai chi!
There is so much to enjoy around and you, like an idiot, do t'ai chi!
Naturally you are becoming serious. A beautiful woman passes by... and
you are doing t'ai chi! Can't you do anything playful, blissful,
pleasant? Naturally you are becoming serious because you are losing
contact with life.</p><p>There are all kinds of idiots in the world. Somebody is doing t'ai
chi, somebody is doing aikido, somebody is doing jujitsu, somebody is
doing yoga, standing on his head. Now, I don't think any woman is going
to be interested in you: this kind of fellow who is standing on his head
is already dead! So then nobody takes interest in you, and you become
serious. You are creating it, and you want me to chase it out. I am not
responsible for it. Who suggested you do t'ai chi?</p><p>I have heard that three missionaries were caught by cannibals in
southern Africa. The chief of the cannibals asked the first, "Which do
you want -- you can choose</p><p>-- do you want `chi-chi' or do you want death?"</p><p>The man thought about it and he said, "Whatever chi-chi is, it cannot
be worse than death." So he said, "I want chi-chi."</p><p>So he was given the treatment they called chi-chi. He was sexually
abused, beaten... and as chi-chi started, he started thinking, "It was
better to choose death. These people will kill me by chi-chi, and they
are unnecessarily humiliating me."</p><p>And the other two missionaries were watching what was going on. Then
the turn came to the second: "What do you want?"</p><p>Death is such a dangerous thing... he thought, "One can survive
chi-chi, but death you cannot survive." He also said, "Chi-chi."</p><p>So again the whole game began. All the cannibals were beating him and
doing all kinds of stupid sexual perversions -- and the poor missionary
had come to save them...!</p><p>Now the turn came of the third, who was the chief missionary. The
chief asked, "What do you think -- chi-chi or death?"</p><p>He said, "It will be a great mercy if you allow me death. Chi-chi I
have seen."</p><p>But the chief said, "This is a problem: we don't kill anybody before
chi-chi, and after chi-chi nobody survives!"</p><p>Now what are you interested in t'ai chi for? Naturally it will make
you serious. You will forget laughing, you will forget a sense of humor
-- a man of t'ai chi has to be serious.</p><p>And you are asking me to take out the seriousness... and the monkey.
The monkey comes in the same package! You become serious and the monkey
will come in.</p><p>And as far as the monkey is concerned, it is his problem -- you don't
worry. You just get rid of this chi-chi.</p><p>Just to deceive you they have changed the name to t'ai chi! Question
3</p><p>BELOVED MASTER, PLEASE FORGIVE ME.</p><p>I CANNOT PUT MYSELF ON THE LINE ENOUGH. I AM AT YOUR FEET.</p><p>Nirupa, you must be living in a misunderstanding, because I have
never been angry at you; I have never been angry at anyone, Ronald
Reagan included!</p><p>Asking to be forgiven... you are asking something which must be your
projection. I have never been angry at anyone. You have been always
forgiven, but you must be carrying something in your mind. You say, "I
cannot put myself on the line enough."</p><p>Who is asking you to put yourself on the line enough? As you are, you
are perfectly okay and acceptable and lovable -- but you seem to be a
martyr.</p><p>Who can be perfect in this world?</p><p>The world itself is not perfect, because perfection means death. If
you want to live, you have to remain a little bit imperfect always, so
that you can go on perfecting yourself.</p><p>Evolution is nothing but a constant imperfection. Imperfection gives
you space to grow into.</p><p>And remember one thing: you will never be perfect. You will be coming
closer and closer and closer, but you will never be perfect. Perfection
is not allowed by the laws of nature itself.</p><p>And the idea that "I cannot put myself on the line enough" -- there
is no need. Put on the line as much as you enjoy -- that is enough.</p><p>But I have a feeling that you want to go up the ladder to the highest
rung... But you don't know that the ladder at the highest rung goes
nowhere. You come to the highest rung and then you look stupid. Then
your whole life is wasted: you have become the president, you have
become the prime minister and all kinds of nonsense people. But they all
feel awkward; that's why they go on smiling to hide... so that nobody
suspects that they have been stupid. There are ladders and ladders.…</p><p>Hymie Goldberg is right. He became the richest man and when asked,
"What have you learned?" he said, "Nothing but climbing ladders -- and
at the end there is nothing."</p><p>But you cannot even say that at the end there is nothing.</p><p>Nirupa, you are perfectly good. You have always been good. My love to
you has never wavered. It does not waver to anybody. And I know your
devotion, your dedication; it is immensely valuable.</p><p>But you are living in some misunderstanding. Drop that
misunderstanding. You are on the line, and there is no need to be
forgiven. You have all my love, as everybody else has.</p><p>Here there is no hierarchy. Here there is nobody higher and nobody
lower.</p><p>There was to be a christening party for the new baby, but before the
ceremony the priest took the new father aside and asked, "Are you
prepared for this solemn event?"</p><p>"I think so," replied the father. "I've got cheese rolls, salad and
cake." "No, no," interrupted the priest, "I mean spiritually
prepared?"</p><p>"Well, I don't know," said the man thoughtfully. "Do you think two
cases of whiskey are enough?"</p><p>You are living in some fantasy about yourself and torturing yourself.
A few people like torturing... And I told you, here there is no
hierarchy. And that's one of the most important things to be remembered:
the people who are doing the work are just functional; they are not
higher than you.</p><p>In the commune in America... because I was silent and in isolation,
people created hierarchies just out of their routine habit. As I came
out, those who were at the top of the hierarchy tried to persuade me
that I should not speak, that things are going well and I should not see
anybody -- everybody is okay.</p><p>I asked, "Then what is the purpose of me being here? If they are all
okay, I should go back to my country where nobody is okay." I had to
insist: "Now it is enough. Three years is enough, and I want to come to
my people and see what is</p><p>happening."</p><p>And when I started speaking the whole gang that had created the
hierarchy escaped, because now there was no possibility... wherever I am
there is no hierarchy, only functions. Somebody is doing cleaning,
somebody is doing the work of the secretary, somebody is doing the work
of the person in charge of the ashram, but there is nobody higher and
lower.</p><p>And you should remember, Nirupa, a very significant law: The
organization of any bureaucracy is very much like a septic tank -- the
really big chunks always rise to the top!</p><p>Don't be bothered. Question 4 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>SEVERAL TIMES I HAVE READ IN YOUR BOOKS, OR HEARD YOU MENTION, THE
PSYCHOLOGICAL FACT THAT MAN THINKS ABOUT WOMAN ONCE</p><p>EVERY THREE MINUTES, WHILE WOMAN ONLY THINKS ABOUT MAN ONCE</p><p>EVERY SEVEN MINUTES. IS THIS ONLY A PSYCHOLOGICAL DIFFERENCE, OR DOES
IT GO DEEPER? TO BE MORE SPECIFIC, PLEASE EXPLAIN THE TWO</p><p>(OR FOUR) SIDES OF THE MIDNIGHT BEDROOM DILEMMA OF "I HAVE A
HEADACHE."</p><p>A few things first. The psychological fact of man thinking about
woman every three minutes -- they cannot wait more than that -- is only
average, because science talks only about averages. Don't believe that
you are the average person; the average person does not exist. There may
be people who are thinking only of women all the time!</p><p>A psychologist was testing a patient. He drew a straight line on the
paper and asked the patient, "What does it remind you of?"</p><p>He said, "It reminds me of women."</p><p>The psychologist said, "Strange. A straight line?" But he tried more
lines. He made a triangle and asked the man, "What does this remind you
of?"</p><p>The man said, "You seem to be a strange person. This reminds me of
women!"</p><p>The psychologist made a round circle. The man got very angry. He
said, "You are coming too close. I am suffering from women, and you are
reminding me of them again and again. Are you a sex maniac or
something?"</p><p>The psychologist said, "It is a very strange, peculiar case. Why do
these things remind you of women?"</p><p>The man said, "Everything reminds me of women! Look out of the
window" -- a camel was going by. "That camel too reminds me of women.
You remind me of women! In fact, I don't think about anything else --
this is my whole life philosophy."</p><p>Those three minutes are for average people -- and average people
don't exist. It is just a mathematical calculation in which children are
included who don't think of women; in which really ripe and grown-up
people are included who don't think of women; in which sex maniacs are
included who don't think about anything else.… So don't be satisfied
with the average; just look at yourself and find out how many minutes
you can remain without thinking of women.</p><p>My own experience of thousands of men is that the gap is at the most
one minute. You can keep a watch in front of you and test whether in one
minute the idea of women comes or not. And you will be surprised: "My
god. Every minute I am thinking of women."</p><p>The case with women is totally different. Seven minutes is also an
average, but ordinarily no woman thinks of man every seven minutes. The
average is because women sex maniacs also exist. There are women who
don't think of men at all -- hours pass -- and they feel great
relief.</p><p>And you are asking me -- this has become the midnight bedroom dilemma
of "I have a headache." That is a female thing, not a male thing. It is
a female strategy. Unless you are very close to female chemistry you
will not say, "I have a headache."</p><p>Man uses the woman just like sleeping pills. Sex gives him a good
sleep. All energy is gone out of him. Now there is nothing else to do
except to fall asleep and hope that in the morning he can get up.</p><p>Man's mind is different than woman's mind. They function in different
directions.</p><p>Doctors, who are mainly men, have researched and come to the
conclusion that no man has died while making love. That's true. In the
whole history of billions of human beings no man has died by making
love, while making love. Nobody has suffered a heart attack while making
love.</p><p>So for man, woman is almost a commodity to be used for good sleep,
for no heart attack, for avoiding death as far as he can.</p><p>But the woman has been almost tortured. First she has had her
orgasmic joy taken away, because man finishes too soon, before the woman
has even begun. The difference in the orgasmic capacity between man and
woman is immense; it is a recent discovery, in this century -- the whole
humanity in the past has lived in darkness.</p><p>Man's sexuality is local, genital. Woman's sexuality is widespread,
all over her body.</p><p>Naturally, to attain an orgasmic experience her whole body has to
throb with joy, tremble with ecstasy -- but that will take time. By the
time her whole body is ready and trembling and feeling a dance of energy
in her being, the man is fast asleep. He is finished, he has gone to
sleep.</p><p>Man has been in many ways cruel, primitive and barbarous towards
women. He has never cared what she feels; he is only concerned with
himself. He has been using women -- and remember the most humiliating
thing in the world is to be used, because that brings you down from your
dignity into a commodity.</p><p>Commodities are used. Human beings are not used, but women have been
used for thousands of years. In fact, they have even forgotten that they
have any orgasmic capacity. Naturally, they try to avoid this ugly scene
as much as possible; hence "I have a headache" is a feminine
strategy.</p><p>You are in a deep misunderstanding; put things right! If you want a
woman not</p><p>to have a headache, then be playful with her: sing, dance, bring to
your bedroom the atmosphere of a temple, burn incense, take a good bath
after the whole day's... And your love should be the climax.</p><p>But wait! Unless the woman starts throbbing and trembling and starts
becoming ecstatic, only then making love to her will you have an
orgasmic experience and she will have an orgasmic experience. And when
both orgasmic experiences happen simultaneously, it is a tremendous
phenomenon. Religiously it is a tremendous phenomenon, because it will
give you the first glimpse of meditation.</p><p>My own understanding is that man has come to know about meditation
from no other source, because there is no other source available. How
did man start to think, in the very beginning, about meditation? Mind,
you know, is natural; meditation has to be achieved.</p><p>Something must have given him a glimpse beyond mind. Orgasmic
experience gives you a state when time stops, mind stops, and you are
sheer joy.</p><p>That has been, according to me, the source of thinking that going
beyond mind is possible. And if it is possible in sexual orgasm, a few
adventurous people, pioneers, must have tried... why can't it be
possible alone? Because two things they have got absolutely correct:
time stops, mind stops.</p><p>Of course you cannot stop time directly; hence the conclusion: stop
the mind. And the moment mind is silent and has stopped, time stops, and
suddenly you find yourself, without any sexuality, in an orgasmic joy
which is far deeper than the sexual. In sex you are dependent on the
other person; now you are absolutely free.</p><p>If people like Gautam Buddha or Mahavira became celibate... it was
not that through being celibate they became Gautam Buddha and Mahavira.
The situation is just the reverse: they became Gautam Buddha and
Mahavira by meditation and they found a far bigger freedom and orgasmic
joy. Sex disappeared from their life.</p><p>But people have looked at it wrongly. From the outside you cannot see
their orgasmic joy; you can only see that this man has become celibate.
Perhaps by becoming celibate you will also attain the orgasmic joy. It
does not work that way.</p><p>Mind has to stop first, then time stops. And when both time and mind
are stopped you have tremendous ecstasy, ecstasy so great... There is
not only a difference of degree between sexual orgasm and spiritual
orgasm; the difference is qualitative: it has a beauty of its own, a
blissfulness of its own, a contentment of its own.</p><p>But the whole of humanity has been misled because of a logical
fallacy. People saw that Bodhidharma or Sanai or Ta Hui have become
celibate... perhaps by becoming celibate we will attain to their
enlightenment. But by becoming celibate you will become only a
pervert.</p><p>Just the other day my news service, Anando, has brought the news that
in Europe Catholic bishops and priests are leaving the churches and
getting married. And the fear has arisen... in the backward countries
many people have been converted and now they are becoming bishops and
cardinals. Perhaps the day is not far away when black people will be
teaching in the white countries as bishops and cardinals. And then the
final step is the first black man becoming the pope -- because it is a
question of majority or minority, and white bishops are becoming the
minority every day.</p><p>But those priests are on the right path. They have suffered
unnecessarily and now they have gathered courage and they are marrying.
My feeling is it is a good sign.</p><p>But the Catholic church is afraid that black people may dominate
Catholicism. That would be a strange situation, because the white man
has always thought that he is carrying the whole burden of humanity,
that he is responsible for everybody's salvation. It is not going to be
so anymore. Soon black people will be the saviors of white people. You
have saved for many centuries, now give them a chance. You have not been
able to save anything; perhaps black people may be able to save.</p><p>The danger is greater because black people are sexually more powerful
than white people... perhaps because of the climate, their situation,
their food. If black people start dominating the Catholic church, then
there is going to be an immense perversion of sexuality; it is now
Africa which is suffering most from the disease AIDS. But this influx
cannot be stopped; the Catholics have invited it themselves.</p><p>Just try to be alert and don't imitate, and your seriousness will be
gone, your headache will be gone.</p><p>Father John, a Catholic priest, was astonished one day to see his
friend, Father Michael, driving a Mercedes-Benz. He asked him how he
could afford such a great car when all he could afford was a
bicycle.</p><p>So Father Michael told him that one day during the prayer before the
collection he was swinging his rosary when he realized that the whole
congregation was hypnotized. So he told everyone to empty their wallets
and when he counted the money he had enough to buy a car.</p><p>Father John said, "That's great. I'm going to try it."</p><p>But a few weeks later when they met again, Father John was still
riding his bicycle.</p><p>"What happened?" asked his friend.</p><p>"Well," said Father John, "everything went just as you said and the
congregation was completely in my power. But just then I dropped the
rosary and said, Òh shit,' and I'm still cleaning the church!"</p><p>Paddy and Maureen live in an old house, very close to the railway
station, and every time a train goes by, the door of their bedroom
wardrobe opens by itself. Maureen gets so fed up with this that one day
she calls a carpenter to come and fix it. But he can't locate the
problem and he decides that the only thing to do is to get inside it,
close the door and watch what happens.</p><p>Just then Paddy comes home. He sees a pair of men's shoes in the
bedroom and starts looking around for the owner, but before Maureen can
explain a train goes by, the wardrobe opens by itself, and the carpenter
is revealed inside.</p><p>Paddy is furious. "And what the hell are you doing here?" he cries.
"You won't believe this," says the man, "but I'm waiting for a train!"
Life is so hilarious, and you are having a headache!</p><p>Enjoy life and you will forget not only the headache but even the
head, because</p><p>one remembers the head only when he has a headache -- have you
noticed that? My definition for a healthy man is that he does not feel
his body at all. The moment you have a heartache you feel the heart; the
moment you have a stomachache you feel the stomach; when you have a
headache you feel the head. If you are perfectly healthy you will not
feel the body at all. It is simply there.</p><p>But mistakes happen because our clarity about existence is not
meditative. Our mind is continuously creating unnecessary problems,
unnecessary dilemmas.</p><p>Hymie Goldberg was a string salesman from New York. His boss sent him
to the deep South in order to open some new accounts for the company,
but Hymie encountered discrimination everywhere he went and was unable
to do any business. Finally, in Mississippi, an anti-Semitic store owner
said to Hymie, "Okay, Jew, I'll buy as much string as reaches from the
end of your Jewish nose to the tip of your Jewish prick."</p><p>A month later, the same store owner was surprised to receive four
hundred cartons of grade "A" string. Inside was a bill for twenty-five
thousand dollars and a note which said: Thank you for your generous
order. I hope we can do business again soon. Signed: Hymie Goldberg.

else can be found? You are all a joke unto yourself.</p><p>Gautam Buddha said as his last statement: "Be a light unto yourself."
The day I leave the body please remind me, so that I can make my last
statement: "Be a joke unto yourself."</p><p>That is far more joyful than being a light unto yourself. What are
you going to do with a light? Light your cigars, or burn people's
houses?</p><p>But being a joke unto yourself, you will be a bliss for everyone.</p><p>You are right... this is the way I find jokes -- looking at you. So
be aware when I look at you; I am searching for a joke!</p><p>A big old Indian was sitting in a bar out West when a dirty hippy
came in and started to drink a lot and insult all the other people
there. Soon everyone had left the bar in disgust except for the old
Indian who just watched the hippy with interest.</p><p>So the hippy walked over to him and said, "Hey, Indian, what the hell
are you staring at?"</p><p>"Well," said the Indian, "many years ago I was arrested for making
love to a buffalo, and I just had a feeling that maybe you are my
son."</p><p>I see your troubles and really... I take them seriously, but deep
inside I am giggling. Not to offend you I talk about your problems,
which are sheer nonsense</p><p>-- but don't tell it to anybody!</p><p>Once there was a man who had everything a man could desire: a
wonderful job that he liked, a wonderful wife and wonderful children,
but then one day he began to see spots in front of his eyes. At first he
tried to ignore them, but they began to get worse. So finally he paid a
visit to the doctor. The doctor examined him but could find nothing
wrong with him, so he sent him to a specialist, a neurosurgeon, who
examined him thoroughly with many tests. He also could find nothing.</p><p>But he said to the man, "Although I can find nothing specific, I have
seen cases like this before; often it is some pressure on the brain,
which usually results in death after six months to a year."</p><p>The man became very upset, but then he decided that if indeed he only
had such a short time to live, he would enjoy life and do everything he
ever wanted. The man loved nice clothes, so he went to the best tailor
in town and said, "Give me the best clothes you have in your store:
English imported suits, Italian leather shoes, hand-stitched silk ties,
and one dozen of the best tailored silk shirts, size</p><p>fourteen neck."</p><p>The tailor who had taken all his measurements said to him, "Fourteen
neck? You don't have a fourteen neck -- you have a fifteen neck!"</p><p>"Don't tell me what I have," said the man, "I have been wearing a
size fourteen neck all my adult life."</p><p>"Well, if that's so," said the tailor, "then you must be seeing spots
in front of your eyes!"</p><p>Seeing you, certainly I rejoice. So many jokes all around! Perhaps
this is the first gathering in the world where jokes are being used for
your spiritual growth.…</p><p>And you cannot be otherwise -- unless you become enlightened. Only
enlightened people don't have anything in life which you can make a joke
of. But in ignorance and unconsciousness, whatever you do is somehow
hilarious -- your fights, your love affairs, your marriages, your
divorces. If you start watching your behavior, you will find out for
yourself -- "My god. My whole life is full of jokes!"</p><p>And it will be a great revelation... far greater than the revelation
of God, because that too is only a joke and nothing else.</p><p>Okay, Vimal? Yes, Osho.</p><p>The Great Pilgrimage: From Here to Here Chapter #3</p><p> </p><div class=toc><p><a href=part1 class=toc0>Chapter title: Into the open sky</a><a href=part2 class=toc0>Chapter title: Suddenly you have

BELOVED OSHO,
CAN YOU SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THE MYSTERY OF WOMEN?
Devageet, it is one of the ancientmost questions. Man has always puzzled about women, and the real problem is neither man nor woman.

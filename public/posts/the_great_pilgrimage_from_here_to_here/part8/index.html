Man has always puzzled about women, and the real problem is neither man nor woman. Reduced to the factual, to the existential, the problem is between the head and the heart.\nThe head cannot understand the mystery of the heart. The head is logical,\nrational, mathematical, scientific; the heart knows nothing of reason, nothing of logic. The heart functions in a totally different way. Its functioning creates in the head the idea of the mystery. It is not a question about women; it is a question that arises because women function through the heart and man functions through the head. Have you ever heard any women asking, \"What is the mystery of man?\" They simply know it.\nThe problem arises out of logical reasoning. It is a very superficial phenomenon. It is good with objects, with dead things; it deals with them perfectly because a dead thing has no interiority, a dead thing has no inner being, it has no life. The scientist is perfectly right about objects, but the moment he comes to think about subjectivity -- the interiority\n-- he is baffled, because reason cannot function there.\nThe heart knows without any process of knowing, without any syllogism, without any argument. How do you know that the rose is beautiful? Is it a rational conclusion? If you bring reason in, you will not be able to prove that the rose is beautiful, because reason cannot fathom the phenomenon of beauty.\nWhen you say the rose is beautiful, you are functioning from the heart. When you say the starry night overwhelms you, it is not a rational statement; if you are forced to prove it rationally, you will be at a loss. Then suddenly you will become aware that it was the heart that has spoken, and the head is absolutely incapable of figuring out how the heart functions.\nBut the heart is not in the same difficulty about the head, because the head is superficial and the heart is deep down within you. The lower cannot understand the higher. The higher simply understands the lower, there is no need of any reasoning. Your heart is both higher than your head and deeper than your head. The woman can be a poet, but cannot really be a mathematician. Mathematics is purely a game of the mind. Poetry is a totally different phenomenon.\nI am reminded of Frau Einstein, Albert Einstein's wife. She was a poet, and Albert Einstein was perhaps the greatest scientific thinker of all the ages. Naturally Frau Einstein wanted her husband to know about her poetry. Einstein tried to avoid the subject as much as he could, but finally one night, the full moon in the sky, Frau Einstein could not resist the temptation. She had composed a beautiful poem about the full moon, and she recited the poem.\nAlbert Einstein looked at her with great surprise, almost shocked. She could not understand, \"Why is he looking at me in this weird manner? At the most he can say that the poetry is not great... but he is looking at me as if I am insane!\" After the recital of the poem she asked Albert Einstein, \"What do you think?\"\nHe said, \"I had never thought that you are so crazy. You talk about the moon as beautiful, you talk about the moon reminding you of your beloved. It is sheer nonsense! The moon is too big, it cannot be substituted for your beloved. And the moon is not at all beautiful!\nIt is just as ordinary as the earth, even more ordinary because there is no greenery, no water, just barren land. And the light that you see reflected from the moon is not its own.\nThat light is borrowed from the sun, it is not coming from the moon. The sunlight falls on the moon and the rays are reflected back, and those reflected rays are coming to your eyes;the moon is not the source of them. I had always thought that you are well educated, but you don't know even the ABC of physics!\"\nNow was the chance for Frau Einstein to look at him as if he is insane, because for centuries poets have sung songs about the moon -- its beauty, its tremendous magnetic force, its cool light. It has a certain hypnotic spell on the heart... and it is now also proved by facts that it has a certain hypnotic spell.\nMore people -- in fact all except Mahavira -- have become enlightened on a full- moon night. Mahavira is the only exception; he became enlightened on a no- moon night.\nGautam Buddha was born on a full-moon night, became enlightened on a full- moon night, died on a full-moon night. He is a perfect example of the hypnotic spell of the moon. Many more people go mad on the full-moon night -- these are approved statistics -\n- and more people commit suicide on full-moon nights.\nThe full moon somehow drives man's mind into dimensions beyond reasoning. And it is not only man that is affected by the full moon; even the ocean is affected. But a physicist, a mathematician will not be able to understand it -- and Frau Einstein never again mentioned poetry to Albert Einstein in her whole life.\nAlthough she went on composing, she was not publishing them. It was decided on the first recital that that kind of dialogue is not possible between her and her husband -- but it is not any exceptional case.\nNo husband and no wife are in the situation of understanding each other.\nMisunderstanding is the natural situation. The man says something, the woman immediately understands something else. The man cannot believe how she has come to this conclusion -- and to the woman that conclusion is absolutely clear, there is no doubt about it. And whatever she says, the man is at a loss to figure it out.\nPsychologists have started calling couples intimate enemies. They are... because no one understands each other. But the reason is not the woman and the man. The reason is far deeper. It is the head and the heart.\nSo I would like to emphasize the point, Devageet, that the question from the very beginning has been formed in a wrong way. It is not the mystery of women, it is the mystery of the heart -- which the head is incapable of figuring out. The heart has no problem about the head;it is a lower, more superficial layer, and the heart understands it.\nSo when men say that women are mysteries, women simply smile amongst themselves:Look at these idiots! Have you ever heard any woman saying that women are mysteries? They know each other perfectly well. There is no mystery.\nIt will be better to understand in a different dimension too. Forget about man and woman; just think about your own head and your own heart. Do they have a communion? Are they capable of understanding each other? I have not met Albert Einstein, but I would have loved to meet him for the simple reason that I wanted to ask him how he fell in love with Frau Einstein. What physics, what mathematics, what science is behind the experience of falling in love?\nBut perhaps he never thought about it. Love is coming from the heart; it cannot come from the head. Even the greatest scientist once in a while goes astray from the head. One beautiful sunset and he is overwhelmed. He forgets that he is a scientist and he is not allowed to do such things, feminine things; he is a male mind. And every scientist falls in love with a woman without ever thinking what love is. It is a mystery... even your own heart is a mystery to you.\nMy own understanding is that Mahavira at first denied any women to be initiated into sannyas. The same was the case with Gautam Buddha;he denied women to be initiated into sannyas. And the same is the case with other religions; they have all put woman in a secondary place. And the reason, according to me, is that all our so-called religions are head-oriented... too much head. Their God is not their love, their God is their idea. It is a hypothesis. They have created a system -- rational, logical, flawless -- but it is their own mind which is creating the system. It is not a discovery. It is not unveiling the mystery of existence.\nAnd why have all these religions been so afraid of women? There were other reasons, but the most fundamental reason is that all the founders of religions were male, and their theologies were from the head. To allow women among their fellow travelers was to create unnecessary trouble, because they speak different languages, they understand different languages. They are coming from different spaces. At the most, they can tolerate each other.\nThat is what is happening between every wife and every husband: they are just tolerating each other. There seems to be no possibility of a sane conversation. Any conversation between a wife and husband immediately leads to conflict, and the woman starts behaving, according to man, in such a crazy way... throwing things, breaking things. He cannot understand -- what argument is this? But the woman knows perfectly well that only this argument will decide the thing -- and it decides! The man simply agrees, \"You are right, but just don't destroy more things!\" In every argument with a woman, the woman is the winner, although she knows nothing about argumentation.\nThe day he initiated the first woman into sannyas, Gautam Buddha said, \"My religion was going to last for five thousand years. Now it will last only five hundred years\" -- not a great welcome to the poor woman!\nAsked why he was saying so, he said, \"It is impossible to include both women and men without them coming into conflict. The religion will destroy itself from within. If it had remained just confined to males there was a possibility for it to continue at least for five thousand years, because they can understand each other.\"\nYou have to be very alert about it.… I am the first man who makes no difference between initiating men and women, and my feeling is -- if I were to reply to Gautam Buddha, I would say, \"If it was only males it would last for only five\nhundred years. Now it is men and women together it can last for eternity.\"\nWhen heart and head are together, you are more complete and more whole. Heart is a part, head is a part, but together... if a communion is possible, your strength is not doubled, it is multiplied. How can the head and the heart come to a point of meeting?\nAnd it is a multidimensional question:\nIt is between the woman and the man. It is between the heart and the head.\nIt is between the East and the West.\nOne of the royal poets of England, Rudyard Kipling, has written two famous lines which have become better known than anything else that he wrote. Those lines are, \"East is East and West is West, and never the twain shall meet.\" Nobody has argued against it... and he was the royal poet of the British Empire.\nBut I disagree absolutely, without any conditions and reservations, because wherever you are standing East and West are meeting. Bombay is West to Calcutta, Calcutta is East to Bombay;Tokyo is East to Calcutta, and Calcutta is West to Tokyo. Wherever you are, you cannot say you are in the East or in the West. They are relative terms;they are not fixed territories. Wherever you are, in every man, in every tree, in every bird, East and West are meeting.\nRudyard Kipling is simply talking nonsense! But he has a point in his ridiculous statement -- and the point is the same. The West is head-oriented and the East is heart-oriented. It is the same question in different directions: How can they meet? How can there be an intimate love between the head and the heart, not intimate enmity? -- it is a contradiction in terms.\nThey meet in meditation, because in meditation the head is empty and the heart is empty: the head is empty of thoughts and the heart is empty of feelings. When there are two emptinesses you cannot keep them separate, because there is nothing between them to keep them separate. Two zeros become one zero... Two nothingnesses cannot exist separately; they are bound to become one because there is not even a fence between them.\nBut Rudyard Kipling, although he lived in India almost his whole life, has never heard about meditation. It is meditation in which the head and heart lose each other, melt into each other. It is meditation in which man and woman melt into each other.\nIn India we have an ancient, very ancient statue -- one of the most beautiful pieces of art -\n- a statue of Ardhanarishwar. The statue is half man and half woman. It is the statue of Shiva, the Hindu God, and half of the body is of the woman and the other half of the body is of the man. Up to the time of Carl Gustav Jung it was thought that it is only a mythology, metaphor, poetry -- but this cannot be true. The whole credit goes to Carl Gustav Jung for introducing to the world that this is not a metaphor, this is a reality.\nEvery man and every woman are both, because every child is born of a father and a mother. So something of the mother and something of the father is present in every child, whether the child is a girl or the child is a boy. The only difference can be that the man is a little more man, perhaps fifty-one percent man and forty-nine percent woman, and the woman is fifty-one percent woman and forty-nine percent man. But the difference is not much.\nThat's why it has become scientifically possible to change the sexes -- because the other sex is also present, just the percentage of hormones has to be changed. What was fifty-one percent has to be made forty-nine, or what was forty-nine has to be made fifty-one...\nthen the man becomes woman and the woman becomes man.\nBut even within you, you are not at ease. There is a conflict, continuous conflict between the head and the heart, between the man and the woman. This conflict can be dissolved only if the head drops its thinking and the heart drops its feeling and both are just pure empty spaces. In that emptiness there is a great meeting and a great understanding.\nI don't see any woman as a mystery. I have looked hard, and perhaps there will not be another man in the whole world who has come in contact with so many men and so many women. But neither the man seems to be a mystery nor the woman seems to be a mystery, because within myself the head and heart have melted into each other, and that has given me a new perspective and has changed\nthe whole vision around me.\nDevageet, if you really want to understand the mystery of women you will have to understand the art of melting your head into your heart. That will not only help you to know the mystery of women, it will also help you to know the mystery of men. Not only that, it will help you to know the mystery of the whole existence.\nA shy young girl was about to get married, so she went to see her very experienced friend for some advice.\n\"Doris,\" she began, \"it may sound silly, but there are a few things I just have to ask you.\"\n\"That's okay,\" said Doris. \"Just go ahead.\"\n\"Okay,\" said the shy girl, \"is it all right to talk to your husband while making love?\"\n\"Well,\" said Doris, \"I must admit that I have never done that, but I suppose there is nothing wrong in it -- as long as there is a telephone within reach.\"\nThere is mystery but it is not confined only to women. The whole existence is mysterious. This beautiful rain... this music of the falling rain... the joy of the trees. Don't you think there is great mystery?\nThere was a hill station in the state where I was a professor for many years, and on that hill station was a resthouse far away deep in the hills, absolutely lonely. For miles there was nobody... even the servant who used to take care of the resthouse used to leave by the evening for his own home. I used to go to that resthouse whenever I could find time and sometimes it used to rain just like this... and I was alone in that resthouse and for miles there was nobody. Just the music of rain, just the dance of the trees... I have never forgotten the beauty of it. Whenever it rains I again remember it. It has left such a beautiful impact.\nIf you look, then each flower is a mystery. From where do those colors come? Every rainbow is a mystery, every moment of life is a mystery. Just to be here... is it not a mystery that you are nowhere else but here?\nOnce your eyes are clear and your head and heart are no more in conflict,\neverything starts becoming mysterious. Then you don't want to de-mystify it -- that is absolutely ugly and criminal! The mystery of existence has to be welcomed as it is. Dissecting it, demystifying it, is a violation, aggression, violence.\nA man of meditation simply enjoys the flowers, the birds, the trees, the rain, the sun, the moon, the people. It is good that we are all engulfed in a mysterious whole. Life will be utterly boring if every mystery is decoded.\nScience's whole effort is to demystify existence. Poetry and art are concerned in rejoicing, in welcoming the mystery of existence.And the mystic, the religious man, lives the mystery -- not from the outside as a poet, but from the very inside of it. He becomes himself mystery.\nThere is a beautiful story. Unfortunately it cannot be true. I would have loved it to have been true...! In the East there have been many lovers, very famous lovers\n-- Heer and Ranjha, Sheeri and Farhad -- and the most famous is the third couple, Laila and Majnu.\nNone of them could meet and live with each other. That is their great fortune; hence they remained loving each other for their whole life.\nMajnu was a poor man. Laila was a very rich, super-rich girl, and the parents were not willing to give their only girl into the hands of Majnu, who was nobody at all, just a beggar. Just to avoid him, and to avoid any slander, the parents left the town for another city; they had businesses in many cities and houses in many cities.\nThe day they left, Majnu was standing outside the city by the side of a tree, hiding himself in the foliage of the tree, just to see for the last time his beloved Laila moving away. He saw Laila on her camel, and the whole caravan was moving away. He went on looking and looking as far as he could, and in a desert you can see very far, there are no obstructions.\nFinally, beyond the horizon, they disappeared... but Majnu went on looking. This is where the story becomes a myth, but of tremendous significance. He never left that place.\nHe trusted his love, and he hoped that one day Laila will return from the same route.\nThere was no other route going out from the town.\nAfter twelve years, Laila returned. The father was dead and now she was free at last. She never married anyone else; she had insisted that if she was going to marry anyone, she would marry Majnu. Her father had said, \"If that is your decision, then my decision is that you will never marry.\" But when the father died, Laila came.\nNow twelve years is a long time. In these twelve years Majnu had been standing by the side of the tree. The foliage had grown much; he had not eaten, he had not drunk water, and by and by he had become joined with the tree. Standing for twelve years was so long... slowly, slowly he became part of the tree.\nLaila came and she enquired about Majnu in the town. The people said, \"It is a very sad story. He had gone to say goodbye to you, but he never came back. Only once in a while in the deep silences of the night, from a certain tree, a sound comes calling your name:\n`Laila, it is too long. When are you going to come back?' -- and people have become afraid of the tree because it seems the tree is haunted by ghosts or something. Nobody comes close to the tree.\"\nLaila went to the tree. She heard the voice, she heard the joyful welcome, but she could not see where Majnu was hiding. She entered into the foliage of the tree. With great difficulty she could figure out that Majnu had become part of the tree.\nIt cannot be factual... but the mystic becomes part of the mystery of existence. And the story of Laila and Majnu is a Sufi story. Perhaps it is symbolic of the ultimate union with existence.\nNot trying to demystify it, but becoming a part of the mystery yourself, that is the only true understanding. The mystery will remain amystery, but by becoming yourself a mystery, you will understand.\nThat is the only true understanding. All other understandings are only knowledge borrowed from others.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nIS MISUNDERSTANDING NATURAL TO THE HUMAN MIND?\nMilarepa, misunderstanding is certainly natural to the human mind. Mind is a misunderstanding, and through mind whatsoever you understand is misunderstanding.\nUnderstanding arises only when mind is absent, because what is mind after all? -\n- just a collection of thoughts, none of which is your experience. Through that screen of collected thoughts, whatever you see you interpret. You never see what is there, you only see what your mind can interpret. And all interpretations are misunderstandings.\nWhen there is no interpretation, you simply see the fact, the truth... that which is. Then the mind does not distort, does not color, does not give meanings to it. You don't have any mind; you are just an opening, a mirror reflecting reality as it is.\nWhat are the differences in the world between people? What is the difference between a Christian and a Hindu, or a Buddhist and a Mohammedan? Nobody is born as a Buddhist or a Christian or a Hindu. The differences are only of the mind and you don't bring the mind with you when you are born. It is all nurtured.\nYour mind is created by the society you are born in, and of course they create your mind for their own purposes. It is not for you but for the society, for the state, for the church.\nYour mind is a slave. Whoever has created it has created it for its own purposes -\n- to exploit you.\nEvery nation fills your mind with nationality. Every religion fills your mind with the idea that even to die for your religion is the greatest virtue or to kill for your religion is not a sin. All these religions, all these nations, these political, social, religious ideologies, go on conflicting, fighting. Man has not done anything much on the earth except fighting or preparing for fighting. There are only two periods in history: one is preparation for war, and the other is war itself. Man has never known peace.\nMy history teacher in the high school was at a loss when I told him this, because he was talking about periods of peace when there was no war, and he was dividing history into war periods and peace periods. I said, \"I cannot agree with you because what do you do in your peace time? -- you prepare for war. So I\nwould like to divide history into two periods: preparation for war, and war itself.\"\nHe was a very nice gentleman, hence he was not angry. For a moment he was silent and then he said, \"Perhaps you are right. My whole life I have been dividing history into these two periods... but you seem to be more clear, because if there is a peace period, from where does the war come in?\"\nThe day we will have peace, then there will be no war. But up to now we have not known peace. What is the reason for all this conflict and war and violence and murders and massacres? The mind!\nThe world will know peace only when we have learnt how to go beyond mind. Then you are not a Christian and you are not an Indian, you are not a Chinese and you are not a communist. Then you are simply a human being. In that utter purity of humanness, the world will come to know exactly what peace is and what a celebration it brings with itself.\nMind as such is nothing but misunderstanding. If you really want to understand, get rid of the mind. But people do just the opposite: in trying to understand they go on strengthening their minds. They think a stronger mind -- more nourished, more reformed, more educated -- will be able to understand. I have seen the most educated people, but their Christianity remains there, their Hinduism remains there. Even the very highly educated culture remains superstitious... and their misunderstanding becomes even deeper. Now they have more refined arguments for their misunderstanding.\nOne great Christian missionary, Stanley Jones used to stay with me. He had fallen in love with me. He was an old man and a world famous missionary, very educated, very refined and sophisticated. But I asked him one day, \"The only thing that puzzles me is that with so much information and so much sophistication, you are still a Christian, you have not yet become just human. Deep down you still think that Christianity is the only true religion, that all other religions are so-so... they may be faraway echoes of truth, but Christianity has the monopoly of truth.\n\"Even with your understanding you have not been able to see that Jesus Christ cannot be compared to Gautam Buddha. Jesus Christ remains a Jew, dies a Jew. He had no idea that his crucifixion would become the beginning of a new\nreligion. He had never thought beyond the boundaries of Jewish thinking. Gautam Buddha was a rebel. He was born a Hindu, but he renounced Hinduism. By renouncing Hinduism, he renounced the whole mind that the Hindus had given to him. He became clear and pure, just a child again. That makes him a totally unique and different person than all other religious people.\"\nStanley Jones said to me, \"Whenever you argue for anything, you argue well! But there are reasons which cannot be dispelled by argument.\"\nI said, \"What kind of reasons?\"\nHe said, \"I cannot refute you on this point, but in the deepest part of me I cannot put anybody above Jesus Christ.\"\nI said, \"This is what I call the mind. You don't have any argument, but still you have a conditioning so deep... with this conditioning you cannot look around the world with open eyes, unprejudiced, impartial.\n\"You go on arguing against other religions without any difficulty. You go on finding superstitions in Hindus, in Mohammedans, in Jainas, in Buddhists, but I have never heard you talk about the superstitions of Christians. Do you mean to say that they don't have any superstitions? Or is it simply that your mind cannot conceive of it because it has been created by Christians? In Christian colleges, in theological trainings, your mind has been completely filled with Christian ideas, and you think it is your mind. In fact you are being used.\"\nBut this is the situation. People think they need a greater mind to understand. I want you to see it clearly: you need no mind if you want to understand. You need only a meditative silent space.\nQuestion 3 BELOVED OSHO,\nAM I REALLY A GOOD THERAPIST?\nPrasad, to be a good therapist is a very difficult job. A good therapist has to be immensely compassionate, because it is not his techniques of therapy that help people, it is his love. There is nothing compared to love as far as healing the wounds of a man's being are concerned. All other techniques can be helpful,\nsupportive, but the basic is not a technique but a loving heart.\nA therapist cannot be a professional. The moment a therapist becomes professional things start going wrong, because the profession of therapy means that the patient should never be cured. He should be given hope but he should never be cured, because once you cure him you have lost one customer. The physician or the therapist, their profession is very strange.\nI have heard about an old doctor. His son came back from the medical college, fresh, and he told the father, \"Now you have become old and I can take charge of all your patients.\nYou can rest. If I need any advice I will ask you.\"\nThe father said, \"I was waiting for this. You are now well educated. You know more than I know, you know the latest researches in medicine, but if I can be of any help, I will be available.\"\nAfter three days the father asked the son how things were going. He said, \"Great, just great. The woman you have been treating for thirty years for arthritis I have cured within three days.\"\nThe father said, \"My god! You are an idiot. That woman is so rich, she can afford to remain uncured for her whole life. And how do you think I was supporting you in the university? That woman has provided money for your education, and that woman was going to provide money for your younger brother. That woman was almost a goldmine.\"\nThe son was shocked. He said, \"What are you saying?\"\nThe father said, \"You are young, you don't understand. This profession is a contradiction.\nYou have to cure, but in such a way that the cure takes as long as possible.\" The poor get cured sooner, the richer get cured on a long term basis...!\nAnd psychotherapy in particular is in an even more dangerous contradiction. There is not a single person in the whole world who is totally psychoanalyzed. In the first place, psychoanalysts are making great earnings; they are the most\nhighly paid professionals in the world. They cannot afford to lose rich patients -- and they have only rich patients.\nPoor countries don't suffer from any diseases which psychoanalysis can help. When people are hungry, what can psychoanalysis do? Psychoanalysis comes only when people are so rich they don't know what to do with their money. Then psychoanalysis comes in and shows them what to do with it -- be psychoanalyzed!\nPrasad, a good therapist is one who avoids being a professional. It should be part of your love, not part of your business; only then can you be a good therapist. And as far as I know, you are one of the best therapists around here. I don't see in you things which lead therapists astray. One is a certain kind of gurudom. A therapist should not become a guru, because the moment you become a guru you start changing your patients into your disciples, you start exploiting their misery for your own aggrandizement, for your own ego. You start playing a role of being superior to you, higher than you.\nI have not seen in your eyes that ugly ego which changes helping people into exploiting people. I have seen so many therapists who sooner or later fall into the trap. Because they know something more than the ordinary normal human being, they are in a position to exploit, they are in a position to create a following. That is not the work of the therapist.\nThe work of the therapist is to help the patient to drop his tensions, to drop his unnecessary problems, to drop his habit of creating problems. Most of the patients that come to you are hypochondriacs; they are not suffering from any real problem. Seventy percent of their problems are just imaginary.\nI have seen people looking into medical periodicals, medical encyclopedias to find out what kind of disease they have -- they don't have any disease! But it seems, particularly in the most advanced countries, women are bragging... just as they used to brag in the past about their ornaments, about their mink coats, about their houses, about their luxuries, now they are bragging about psychoanalysis: \"Who is your psychoanalyst?\" --\nsome poor guy or some great psychoanalyst, only very few people can afford his services... And it becomes an addiction, particularly in societies where people don't have time to listen to anybody, where everybody is in a rush.\nBertrand Russell mentions in his autobiography, \"The way psychoanalysis is growing, I can predict that in the next century, if man still remains on the earth, there will be psychoanalysts on every street in the world.\"Everybody will need once in a while to go to the psychoanalysts -- not because he has a disease, not that he has some mental problem, but just to talk.Nobody listens, nobody has time. You have to pay the psychoanalyst for listening.\nIn fact, if you are attentively listening to somebody a subtle help happens. He unburdens himself; things that he cannot say to other people he can say to you, because it is part of your work that you will keep it secret, that you will not start gossiping about it. So in privacy and secrecy he can open his heart, his wounds which he goes on hiding in the society. And by hiding the wounds, you can never cure them. By exposing them to light they are cured.\nI have heard about a young psychotherapist who was working as an assistant to a famous old psychoanalyst. He used to get bored because people were coming with the same dreams, the same problems, the same worries... every day from morning till evening you have to listen and listen and listen, and it becomes heavy, so heavy that even in the night you cannot sleep. You have listened so much that until it gets settled you cannot sleep.\nBut he had never seen the old man ever feeling tired or bored.\nSo one day, getting out of the office, in the elevator, the young man asked the old psychoanalyst, \"What is your secret? You must have been in psychoanalysis for almost sixty years -- sixty years of listening to all kinds of garbage and crap! I have just been here for three months, and I am tired and finished and I am thinking I have to change the profession. These people will drive me crazy!\"\nThe old man laughed and he said, \"Who listens? There is no need to listen. Just pretend.\"\nThat's why Sigmund Freud has devised a beautiful couch. The patient lies on the couch, and behind the couch -- the patient cannot see -- sits the psychoanalyst. Whether he is there or not does not matter. Once in a while he goes out and comes in, and the psychoanalysis continues. The man goes on talking about his dreams, about his worries, about his problems, uncoiling his mind, and he feels better. The psychoanalyst is not doing anything; he is simply giving his time and pretending to be attentive.\nBut this becomes an addiction. The patient has to come twice or thrice a week because so much goes on gathering in his head that he has to unburden it. But I will not call that old man a good therapist. He is simply exploiting the weaknesses and the frailties of human beings.\nPrasad, be attentive, be respectful, be loving. That makes a good therapist. The patient is not different from you. You are in the same boat. You not only allow him to open his heart, you also open your heart to him to give him a feeling that he is not alone in his suffering, that perhaps everybody in the world is suffering and hiding it.\nThe good therapist will create a friendliness, a deep intimacy with the patient. He should not remain on a high pedestal, far above, as if he has no problems. The fact is therapists have more problems than anybody else. They have their own problems and they have other people's problems too; hence four times more therapists go insane than any other profession, and four times more therapists commit suicide than any other profession. It is not just accidental.\nBut if you can be friendly, if you can hold the hand of the patient, if you can tell him that these are your problems too and it is good to have a companion, to have a friend, \"We can work it out together. It is not only that you will be helped, I will be helped also...\"\nUnless a therapist comes to this humbleness, he is not going to help. And I can see in your eyes the possibility of this humbleness.\nIn the middle of her psychiatric session, Mrs. Blossom suddenly exclaimed, \"Doctor, I simply can't resist you! How about a little kiss?\"\n\"Absolutely not!\" the doctor replied indignantly. \"That would be contrary to the ethics of my profession. Now continue what you were telling me.\"\n\"Well, as I was saying,\" the patient reluctantly resumed, \"I am always having arguments with my husband about his father, and just yesterday... I am sorry, doctor, I just can't go on talking. I have this overwhelming impulse. Come on! What harm would there be if you gave me just one little kiss?\"\n\"That's absolutely impossible!\" the doctor snapped. \"In fact, I should not even be lying here on this couch with you!\"\nPatients are being exploited sexually, financially, in every possible way. The patient has to be given as much respect and dignity as you can manage. You should be a humble helper, not a savior, then you can help people immensely. You can be a good therapist.\nYou have to be.\nMy therapists have to be in a different way than the therapists in the outside world. There they are business people. Here you are helping your fellow travelers, your brothers, your sisters. And by helping them, you are helping yourself because their problems and your problems are not different.\nThe village idiot was very famous. His name was Elmer. One day a village resident wanted to show a visiting friend just what an idiot Elmer was.\n\"Watch this,\" he said. \"Hey, Elmer! I have got something for you.\" He then held out his hand, and on the outstretched palm were a nickel and a dime. \"Go ahead, Elmer,\" he said,\n\"take one.\"\nSo Elmer said, \"Thank you, I will take the big one,\" and picked up the nickel. The man winked at his friend and then said, \"See what an idiot he is?\"\nBut as Elmer shuffled off, the visitor felt sorry for him and ran after him.\n\"Listen, Elmer,\" he said earnestly, \"don't you know that the small coin is worth twice as much as the big one?\"\n\"Of course I do,\" said Elmer, \"but the first time I pick up the dime, they will stop playing the game.\"\nEven idiots are not so much idiots as you think; they have their own intelligence. Your patients are not just to be treated objectively. You have to bridge yourself with your patient. You have to become a friend before you can be a therapist -- and particularly the therapists who are working in the field of sannyas. Their function is not the same as the function of the psychotherapist in the outside world.\nIn the outside world, psychotherapy is nothing but a strategy of the society to keep people within their normal limits; the psychologist, psychoanalyst, therapist are all helping the society. Whenever somebody starts going beyond the normal standards, they pull him back down. It is not necessarily helpful... One can go below mind, and then it is good to pull him up. But if somebody is going beyond mind, then to pull him down is not a help.\nIt is just the opposite of help.\nHere within my field therapy is used only as a cleaning process. It is just preparing the ground, taking out the wild weeds, the stones, so that I can manage to bring the roses of meditation into your life. Here therapy is only a preparation for meditation; its function is totally different from in the outside world. There you have to bring the person back into mind. Here you have to help the person to be courageous so that he can step beyond mind.\nYou are preparing people for me. The ultimate push is going to be through me. You have just to give them courage and encouragement. This can be done not by being special, not by being higher, not by being holier. You are not priests and you are not professionals.\nYou are just fellow travelers in this vast caravan, and you have to help people, prepare people because now there is a gap that never used to be in the past.\nBuddha never needed any psychotherapy for his sannyasins; those people were innocent.\nBut in these twenty-five centuries, people have lost their innocence, they have become too knowledgeable. People have lost their contact with existence. They have become uprooted.\nI am the first person who uses therapy but whose interest is not therapy but meditation, just as it was with Chuang Tzu or Gautam Buddha. They never used therapy because there was no need. People were simply ready, and you could bring the rosebushes without clearing the ground. The ground was already clear.\nIn these twenty-five centuries man has become so burdened with rubbish, so many wild weeds have grown in his being that I am using therapy just to clean the ground, take away the wild weeds, the roots, so the difference between the ancient man and the modern man is destroyed.\nThe modern man has to be made as innocent as the ancient man, as simple, as natural. He has lost all these great qualities. The therapist has to help him -- but his work is only a preparation. It is not the end. The end part is going to be the meditation.\nAs far as you are concerned, Prasad, you are doing perfectly well. Okay, Vimal?\nYes, Osho.\nThe Great Pilgrimage: From Here to Here Chapter #28\nChapter title: Education for life -- and for death\n3 October 1987 pm in Gautam the Buddha Auditorium Archive\ncode: 8710035\nShortTitle: PILGR28\nAudio: Yes Video: Yes Length: 103\nmins Question 1\nBELOVED OSHO,\nI STILL STUDY IN SCHOOL AND I WANT TO KNOW: WHAT IS THE SECRET OF\nEDUCATION?\nMaya, it may be a little difficult for you to understand the secret of education. But I cannot come down from my vision, so I will tell what I feel is the secret, knowing perfectly well perhaps you may not be able to understand it yet, you are too young. But through you perhaps others may understand, and one day you will also grow up and be in a position to understand it.\nThe question is very complex and I can see that you have asked it without knowing its implications. It is the question that is one of the most fundamental for the future of man. I would like to begin from the very beginning.\nUp to now, man has been living an accidental life. No one knows what your potential is, what you are supposed by nature to be. And the question -- the secret of education --\ncannot be decided without knowing what your potential is. Are you going to become a musician? a poet? an engineer? a doctor? Without knowing anything about your possibilities, almost groping in the dark, we go on deciding people's destiny for strange reasons.\nThe very word education, in its roots, means to draw out. It has the very secret in its root-meaning. Whatever is within you as a seed has to be drawn out, given full opportunity, so that it can blossom. But no one knows what is hidden within you, what kind of soil you need and what kind of gardener, what is the right climate and the right season and the right time for you to be sown.\nParents decide about their children according to their own ambitions. Somebody wanted to be very rich and could not be: he is hoping through his children that his ambitions should be fulfilled. Although he could not manage it, he will manage through his children. Naturally he would not like his children to move in\ndirections where possibilities of becoming rich are scarce. As a musician you cannot earn much; as a flute-player you cannot compete with engineers, with doctors, with politicians, with industrialists.\nNaturally the parents who have been interested in money would like to send their children into a certain pattern of education which brings them the right qualification to be rich.\nThe decision is arbitrary. The person about whom it is being decided, his potential has not even been taken into consideration. He may have the potential of becoming a great dancer, or a great painter, he may not have any greed for money, but you are forcing him into a direction where greed for money is an essential to be successful.\nEven if he succeeds... of which there is not much chance, because unless you have an inner urge, an instinct for money, the chances of your success are rare. You will be a failure, and your life will become a long, drawn-out misery. But if by chance you succeed and you become rich, still your misery will not be dropped, because you never wanted to be rich in the first place. This was not your destiny. You are living somebody else's life --\nhow can you be happy? You are trying to fulfill somebody else's ambition and you are not in a position to fulfill your own nature.\nHence the immense misery in the world: the person who could have been a great musician has become just a pigmy industrialist. A person who could have been a great mystic has been forced to become a mathematician. Almost everybody is in the wrong place. And to be in the wrong place is very painful. You yourself are not aware of why you are suffering, because you yourself are not aware that you have missed your target.\nYou are following somebody else's idea of what you should be.\nSo the first thing, according to me, begins with genetic engineering. There lies the secret of all education. Up to now what we have been calling education is a chaos.\nPeople have been consulting astrologers about what their children should be. Now stars are not interested in your children -- I don't see any possibility that stars are even aware of your children. That the congregation of stars in a certain\nposition is going to give your child a certain potential is an unproved hypothesis. Millions of children are born in the world almost at the same moment, but those millions of children cannot have the same destiny although the stars were the same.\nIt is such a far-fetched idea that stars can decide your life. And if stars are deciding, then they are deciding in an insane way. Life on the earth shows that the decisions made about man are made wrongly, whosoever is making them.\nPeople consult palmists, who decide by reading the lines of the hand. It is all sheer nonsense! Birth-charts cannot say anything about you, but all marriages are made by consulting birth-charts... and you can see what those birth-charts are doing! I used to live in a city for a few years, and just opposite me lived a very famous astrologer who was deciding people's marriages by reading their birth- charts. As we were living opposite each other, it did not take long to get introduced to him.\nI told him, \"Do you really believe that what you are doing is sane?\"\nHe said, \"What do you mean? I am the best astrologer around this area. People come to me from hundreds of miles away.\"\nI said, \"That I can see myself. But I also see that your wife beats you. Did you look at your birth-charts when you got married to this woman? And if you could not decide even for yourself, don't you feel ashamed that what you are doing is simply stupid -- and not only stupid, inhuman?\"\nHe was at a loss. I said, \"Remember, I am a strange man. I will spread this news to everybody, and I will sit in the front of my garden to prevent people coming to you. I will tell them what is happening in your life.\"\nAt that very moment his wife came in from the kitchen and she said, \"You are right. I will support you. This man is simply an idiot. He knows nothing; he has destroyed my life, he has destroyed his life, and he is destroying thousands of other people's lives!\"\nBut this goes on. There are people who will consult the I-Ching, who will consult the Tarot cards... But the real thing is somewhere else. And it is known, but religious prejudices are preventing humanity from using it.\nThe secret is in genetic engineering. Now it is scientifically possible to find the program of each human being, even before his birth. The male sperm carries many of the programs for his life and what he can become; whether he will be male or female, whether he will be a strong-bodied man or a weakling, whether he will live a life of health or will remain continually sick, his resistance against disease, how long he will live... and what kinds of potentialities are hidden in him -- whether he can become a great mathematician or a great painter or a great poet or a great industrialist. Your destiny is written in the biological beginnings of your life, not in the birth-chart, nor in the stars, nor in the lines of your hands.\nNow there are scientific openings to a new world: each sperm can be read almost like an open book. You can decide your child's life. Before he is born, you can choose what you want your child to be. To me, the real education begins from there.\nIn each lovemaking the man releases at least one million sperms, but only one sperm may be able to reach the female egg. It is a marathon race. The small sperm -- which is not visible to the bare eyes -- in proportion to his size, the track that he has to follow towards the mother's egg is almost two miles long, and he has only two hours' lifespan. So if he does not reach within two hours, he will die. Such competition he will never again face in his life.\nThe whole life will be competitive, but the beginning is the worst competition you can conceive: one million people rushing towards the female egg, and only one is going to win the race! The remainder are going to die.\nRarely it happens that two sperms reach at the same time -- that's why twins are born.\nSometimes even nine children have been given birth to by a woman, because nine sperms reached at the same time. The reason is this: the female egg remains open only for the first sperm reaching to it. The moment the sperm has entered the egg, the egg automatically becomes hard, it is no more porous, so others reaching are rejected. But if two reach at the same time, then their entry is possible because the egg is still porous.\nNow it is a blind game -- most probably the idiots will reach first. That's why the world is full of idiots! The idiots will not take any care, any consideration of anybody; they will simply rush blindly with full force. The wiser ones may stand\nby the side and see what is happening. The really wise ones may not even participate in the race, it is so stupid.\nThese problems can be solved. But religious superstitiousness is a great barrier in the world for every kind of progress and new idea.\nI will be opposed by all the religions -- it does not matter, I have been opposed my whole life -- but my proposal is that every male who wants children should donate his sperms to a hospital and the medical science board should work out for those sperms what the possibilities are.\nIn those one million sperms there may be Albert Einsteins, Bertrand Russells, Martin Heideggers, great musicians like Yehudi Menuhin, great dancers like Nijinsky, great philosophers like Friedrich Nietzsche, great novelists like Fyodor Dostoevsky. They can be picked out and the father and mother can choose what they want. When you can choose the great diamonds, why go for the colored stones? And when you can be the chooser, why be accidental?\nThey can choose, if they want, a Henry Ford, who will make great riches possible.\nMoney is an art, just as anything else; it has its own geniuses. Everybody cannot be a Henry Ford!\nIf you want your child to be a Gautam Buddha, then you have to see, according to the genetic analysis, which sperm has the potentiality of being a mystic. The sperm has to be injected, so he need not be in competition with all kinds of fellows in a crowd. From that choice starts your education.\nThis is only the beginning of genetic engineering. Finally it is going to happen, the work is growing every day... the chosen sperm has a program, but the program can be changed a little bit. It may be possible that he has the mind of an Albert Einstein, but not the body, not the health -- that can be added, the program can be changed a little bit. He may have just a life of fifty years, but that program can be changed. He can be given as long a life as you want -- the maximum lifespan can be almost three hundred years -- and as much health and as much resistance against disease. All these things can be added to the program.\nThe child now starts the journey with the parents' full awareness of what he is going to become, to what school he should be sent, and what kind of education\nhe should be given according to the genetic code. Then the world will be full of geniuses, talented people, healthy people. It is possible to avoid old age completely... a man can go on living youthfully up to the point of death.\nNow these are not fictions, these have become scientific facts. But religions are even preventing these scientific facts from being known to the public, to the people. They are afraid of strange things. Their fear is that morality will be disturbed. So let it be disturbed...! Anyway, what kind of morality exists in the world? Except hypocrisy, there exists no morality.\nGenetic engineering can decide even the character, the morality, the discipline of the individual who is going to be born. From there many things become possible. For the child, a clearcut, non-accidental career, and for the parents -- because the child is not be given birth through sex -- sex becomes pure fun. It does not carry any responsibility, any danger.\nNow there are one hundred percent safe pills for males. For the women the pill is not one hundred percent safe; she has to take it every day. If she misses one day, because she is not thinking she will make love on that day, then suddenly the husband turns up, or suddenly the husband is gone... either way it works. The opportunity of love arises, and mind tends to take chances. Mind just thinks, \"Every time you make love you don't become pregnant.\"\nA man in the ordinary course of his sexual life has intercourse at least four thousand times. That is the norm; I am not talking about sex maniacs! This is the very average shop-keeper... four thousand times means forty million people. Existence is really abundant. The man may have only two or three children out of forty million people. Forty million people can make a whole country.\nNow they have developed two other pills. The first pill that they have developed was a great revolution, because it prevented women from becoming pregnant. In the past a woman's whole life was nothing but a factory to produce children. She was continuously pregnant; her life was nothing more than the life of a cow. So the first pill prevented her being pregnant, but it was not one hundred percent safe.\nThe second pill is a greater revolution, because it can be taken after you make love. The first was before you make love; the second is a great advancement, because now you need not be worried; you can make love whenever, with\nwhomsoever the possibility arises. And one never knows when the possibility will knock on your door -- perhaps in a train, and you may have forgotten to bring your pills and the possibility may not strike again. It is just a stranger and suddenly you feel like this is the man you are made for, he is made for you... although when the next station comes, he will be gone. The next pill is a greater advancement: you can take it afterwards.\nThe third pill is even more significant: the woman need not take it, the man can take it.\nWithin these three pills all accidental birth can be avoided. Sex becomes just a playfulness, loses all seriousness that it has carried in the past; and you can get a child of which you can really be proud. You can fill the whole earth with the right kind of people.\nCriminals can be avoided, politicians can be avoided, priests can be avoided, murderers can be avoided, rapists can be avoided, violent people can be avoided, or if they have some special quality in them, then their program can be changed, their violence can be taken out. Rather than teaching people not to be violent, not to be thieves, not to be criminals... For thousands of years we have been teaching and it seems to have no effect.\nOn the other hand, we have been making laws against criminals. The laws goes on becoming more and more complicated -- more courts, more jails, more legal experts --\nbut nothing has been of any help. Criminals go on increasing. Our whole approach is unscientific. If a child is born with a program of being a murderer, you cannot do anything. No moral preaching is going to help, no legal threat, \"If you murder somebody, you will be sent to the gallows,\" is going to help.\nIn England in the middle ages it was thought that if criminals were punished in the middle of the town, so that the whole town can see what happens if you steal or if you do something wrong, against the law... Criminals were beaten, naked, and thousands of people were watching them. The idea was that these thousands of people will get the idea that stealing is dangerous: you have to stand naked before your whole town, you lose all your dignity. Not only that, one thousand lashes... your whole body starts losing blood, your skin is broken everywhere, it was sheer humiliation, torture.\nBut the process had to be stopped, because then it was found that when thousands of people were attentively watching a criminal being tortured, thieves were working in the crowd, picking people's pockets. When it was found that even in that crowd many people had lost the contents of their pockets... they were so attentive that they forgot about pockets and they forgot that there may be thieves Finally the government came to the conclusion that this is not going to\nhelp. If people are picking poeple's pockets while another thief is being tortured, you cannot teach !\nPeople have been sentenced to death in thousands, but it has not prevented murderers.\nThe reason is that the murderer has a program in which he is not able to make any change. It is intrinsic in his biology, in his physiology, in his chemistry, about which he is not able to do anything. It is in every cell of his body, and he will have to fulfill his destiny.\nAll your laws are stupid, all your courts are idiotic, and all your lawmakers are utterly ignorant people. They want to do something which no individual is capable of and which can be done only before the child is conceived -- not afterwards. The world is full of blind people, crippled people, paralyzed people, deaf people. They cannot respect themselves.\nJust the other day I received a letter from England. Now I feel at a loss what to do. A young man... he is a sannyasin but he is so ugly that people feel a kind of\nrepulsion, sickness, even to be near him. Now his biology demands that he should fall in love with some woman, some woman should accept him. But no woman even comes close to him.\nHe has written a letter, What should I do?\nNow really he is not responsible for his ugly face; his parents should have taken care. He had no necessity to be born; a beautiful face could have been chosen, because even the face, the beauty, the color, everything is in the program But\nnow it is too late, so what to say to him? No meditation can make him beautiful.\nMeditation can help him to go beyond this urge, biological urge, but he does not want to go beyond the biological urge. His question is: \"Why am I deprived when everybody else is enjoying the love of somebody? What sin have I committed?\" He has not committed any sin, it is just that his parents were\nignorant. The only thing that can be suggested to him is to go through plastic surgery.\nBut there are blind people, there are deaf people, there are crippled people, there are people who are retarded. They don't have any more possibilities of intelligence -- and who is responsible for this? The priests of all the religions have been deceiving humanity.\nThey are the great deceivers. They have been telling people, \"You are suffering from blindness, from crippledness, from paralysis because of your past life's evil acts.\"\nThis is not true. The scientific truth is that people are unnecessarily suffering because we are listening to the priests and not to the scientists. The priests are absolutely against interfering as far as human life is concerned. They start great protests immediately that you should not interfere in the work of God.\nBut I cannot see what kind of work God is doing. Now what about this young man who is created ugly? -- this is God's work? And all these people who are retarded, stupid -- this is God's work? And the priests are not ready to have a different world. They are against family planning, they are against birth control, they are against everything that man is now capable of doing to create a better world, a better humanity.\nSo this is my first thing: education will never be right unless children are born through genetic engineering, not through the old bullock cart method that you have followed up to now. This is one of the most significant secrets: unless we listen to sanity and intelligence, we are not going to revolutionize human life.\nSecondly, a few things about education. I want education to be divided in two parts: the first part should be given in the beginning and the second part should be given at the time a person retires.\nThe first part of education should be for attaining the highest possible standard of livelihood. It should consist of the art of living and love. It should teach people how to be total in their acts, how to use the opportunity of life without losing anything, to squeeze every drop of juice that existence provides. The first part will be for the young people --\ntraining for life and training for love, training for intensity, training for totality.\nThe second part will be after retirement, which will depend how long we can allow man to live. It may be according to the present average lifespan, sixty years, seventy years --\nbut as the person retires. There are people in the area of Kashmir occupied by Pakistan who have passed the one hundred and fiftieth year -- thousands of people. That small area of Kashmir seems to be the most healthy area. They are poor people, with no medical facilities, but even at the age of one hundred and fifty, they are young.\nBut there are other places also in the world, particularly in the Soviet Union, in Kazakhstan, in Azerbaijan, in the Caucasus, where people have lived even longer -- one hundred and eighty years -- and thousands of people, not just one. They are still working in the fields, in the gardens, in the orchards; you cannot call them old, they are still capable of producing children.\nSo it will depend... If genetic engineering succeeds in destroying the superstitions of humankind, then the second part will come very late. The second part will be preparation for death. Just as the first part was preparation for life, the second part will be preparation for death -- how to die meditatively, silently, peacefully; how to meet death with a song and a dance and a welcome.\nThe second part will be basically religious, just as the first part was basically scientific.\nThe education will be complete, but it has to be at both the ends -- the beginning and the end. Each university should have a double structure: one for the young people who are going to enter into life, and the other for the old people who are going to enter into the unknown world of death.\nThe first part of education will be of many dimensions -- all sciences, all arts, all kinds of crafts. Somebody is a great carpenter, somebody is a great shoemaker, somebody is a great scientist, somebody is a great moneymaker -- they are all contributing whatever their potential allows them to life, with totality, not holding anything back. Naturally they should have equal opportunity to grow, and they should have equal respect. Just because a man is a president of a country does not mean that he should have respect and the man who makes perfect shoes should not. Both are fulfilling certain needs of the society; both should have the same honor and the same dignity.\nThis equal opportunity, equal respect will begin from the very world of education. And for education to make all these changes, education will have to go through many changes itself.\nFor example, examinations should be dissolved, because examinations emphasize people's memory, not their intelligence. Memory is not a great thing; particularly in the future it is not going to be of any importance. You can carry your small computer in your pocket which will have all the memories that you need, and any time... immediately the computer will supply. There is no need to fill your head with unnecessary rubbish.\nThe computer is going to replace the whole system of education which has depended up to now on memory. Whoever can memorize more comes first class, gets a gold medal, tops the university. But have you ever thought about what happens to these gold medalists in the world? They don't show anywhere any genius. Somebody is just a head clerk, somebody is just a stationmaster, somebody is a postmaster -- what happened to their gold medals? What happened to the great respect that their university paid to them?\nIn fact the university paid respect to their memories and memories are of not much use in actual life. In actual life you need intelligence. And the difference should be made clear to you. Memory is a ready-made answer. But life goes on changing, it is never ready-made -- so all your ready-made answers are lagging behind life.\nLife needs a living response... not a ready-made answer, but a spontaneous response this moment; it needs intelligence.\nUp to now education systems have not been creating intelligence at all. Intelligence needs a totally different kind of structure. Examinations are for memory, they are a memory test of how much you can memorize. But if questions are asked which you have not memorized, you are at a loss. You don't have the intelligence to respond to a new question for which the answer has not been memorized before.\nThe whole system of examinations is futile. A different structure should be created: each student, every day, should get his credit marks from the teacher to show if he is behaving intelligently, if he is answering things intelligently -- not just a repetition of the textbooks, but something original.\nOriginality should be respected and honored, not repetition -- not being a carbon copy.\nAnd there is no need to wait for one year; if a student can get enough marks within six months, he should pass into a higher standard. There is no question of anybody failing or anybody passing. Just as you start getting closer to the standard beyond your standard...\nthere is no examination. Just with your teachers watching your responses and your intelligence, you will be moving on. Somebody may come one month later, somebody may come a few months later, but there is no question of a fixed year program. I have been a teacher in the university and I know.… There were students who were so talented that they could have passed the whole course set for one year in two months; now ten months are wasted. Who is responsible for that? And there were retarded students; even one year was not enough for them.\nI have seen one person failing ten times in his matriculation examination. You will ask what happened the eleventh time? -- he did not appear in the examination. Enough is enough! He was the most experienced matriculate, although he never passed in ten years continuously. People who had been colleagues with him became his teachers and he was still there -- ready, stable and permanent.\nEach individual should be given credit for his own intelligence. There should not be any time limit, because that time limit wastes the more talented, the more genuinely intelligent, the geniuses, and waits for the retarded, for the idiotic and the stupid. It is an ugly system.\nOf course with genetic engineering the idiots and the stupid will not be allowed to enter into life. Move somewhere else! -- there are fifty thousand planets in the universe where life exists -- why bother us? Move on, go somewhere else where people are still idiots and still listen to the priests and go to the churches. This planet is no more for you.\nThe classroom will have a totally different form. It will not be the classroom where the teacher teaches you; although he knows more and you know less, his knowledge is out of date. He has learned everything thirty years ago, when he was a student. In thirty years everything has changed. It is such an insane structure that people who are teaching in the universities are all out of date.\nWhat they are teaching is no more relevant.\nAccording to me, the library can be the only classroom. The teacher can only be a guide to help the students to find the latest, the recentmost researches in every subject. In the library the students should be there, and the teacher should be there just to help them, because he is more acquainted with the library, he has been longer in the library, he knows about the new discoveries and the latest inventions which have arrived. His function should be that of a guide to lead the students to the up to date knowledge.\nThis can be facilitated very easily with computers, with television sets. In the twentieth century you need not teach people geography with a map when television can bring you exactly to the place you are learning about -- New York or London or Peking -- you need not bother yourself looking at maps, looking at pictures, descriptions. On the television screen you can be instantly in New York, and what is seen is remembered more easily than what is heard, than what is read.\nThe future belongs to the televisions, to the computers, because they are the memory systems. The teacher will have a totally new function that will not be of teaching but only of guidance -- where you can find the right book in the library, where you can find the right video in the library, where you can find the right information in the computer.\nTeaching becomes more alive, more colorful, more real. And the day is not far away when television will be three-dimensional. Then it will seem exactly as if people are walking and may come out of the television set any moment. Only two three-dimensional films were made, then the idea was dropped because they were too costly. But they will come back. With better techniques they will not be that costly.\nI have seen one of the films. It was a strange experience. A man throws a spear -- and the whole audience in the movie hall gives way, because it is as if that spear is going through the hall. It is three-dimensional; it is as realistic as any actual spear can be. A man comes running on his horse and people shriek and divide to give way to the horse... it is just entering into the hall. It never enters! Slowly they become accustomed, by the end of the film: \"Don't be worried. Just sit tight in your seat. Nothing is coming out of the screen. It comes only up to the screen and stops.\"\nWhen things can be taught in three-dimensional televisions and films, when everything that you need to memorize can be done by a small computer... It can be connected with the national computer, which carries all the knowledge that has been found since man started coming down from the trees. You can get every information, information which will be very difficult to remember.\nFor example, if I ask you -- and you are all educated people here -- \"On what day was Socrates married?\"... Now, how educated are you? You cannot remember the date Socrates was married; it was such a great date that he suffered his whole life, and you don't even have compassion enough to remember the date! But your computer can remember all that you want. It can contain whole libraries immediately at hand.\nThe future of education, if scientifically worked out, is going to be a tremendous adventure. Up to now it has been a kind of enforcement; students have to be forced, bribed.\nEducation can become so colorful, so actual, so real that you will not need to say to the students, \"Be attentive!\" They will be attentive automatically.\nAnd the same for the second part of education. All scientific technology can be used to give you experiences very close to death. You can be taught meditations, you can be taught relaxation, you can be taught how to go deeper in your sleep. Hypnotism will play a great role in the second part of education, because you can be hypnotized so deeply that you can almost touch the territory of death.\nHypnotism became condemned by the same people who are always condemning everything that can make man's life more easy, more pleasant, more juicy. The organized religions have been such poisoners. They condemned hypnotism, which is a science in itself and has to be revived again. It is the only way to take you to the whole area that you will pass through when you die.\nIf you have passed that area many times death will not be anything to be feared. On the contrary, you will be tremendously excited. You have lived, you have lived so fully, you are contented with life; you would love to know what death is... a new challenge, a new beginning, entering into the universal, getting out of the imprisonment of the body, becoming just pure consciousness.\nUnless education can teach you both life and death it is not complete education. Unless education can make everybody dignified, self-respectful, neither inferior\nto anybody nor superior to anybody, it is not education. So I begin with genetic engineering.\nI end up with meditation, enlightenment.\nBefore death you must realize what tremendous beauty and splendor is contained within your consciousness. Then education covers your whole life, and gives you the most perfect possibility of your growth.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nTHESE DAYS I FEEL LIKE A FRUITCAKE. ALSO I'M READING THE IDIOT BY\nFYODOR DOSTOEVSKY. DO YOU THINK THERE IS ANY CONNECTION?\nVimal, there is nothing wrong in feeling like a fruitcake. It is really delicious. It is so nice... and it cannot have any connection with the reading of the great masterpiece of Fyodor Dostoevsky, THE IDIOT. THE IDIOT is only the name, but the person he calls the idiot in that great novel... That novel has to be considered one of the ten great novels in the whole world literature. There is no way to think that anything better than Fyodor Dostoevsky's IDIOT can be created.\nThe idiot is a sage. He is called idiot by the people because they can't understand his simplicity, his humbleness, his purity, his trust, his love. You can cheat him, you can deceive him, and he will still trust you. That's why people think he is an idiot. He is really one of the most beautiful characters ever created by any novelist.\nThe novel could just as well have been called THE SAGE. His trust is so much that it does not matter that you deceive. It does not matter that you cheat him; that is your problem, it is not his problem. His love, his trust will continue. Dostoevsky's idiot is not an idiot; he is one of the sanest men amongst an insane humanity.\nBut this is the problem: if you are living in a society where everybody is blind and only you have eyes, you will be in constant difficulty. Those blind people will not believe that you have eyes; those blind people would like to destroy your eyes, because your eyes are giving them constant anxiety and tension. But somebody has something which nobody else has... so most probably they will destroy your eyes.\nIn an insane world, to be sane is the most difficult situation. If you can become the idiot of Fyodor Dostoevsky, it is perfectly beautiful; it is really a fruitcake! There is no harm in it. It is better than to be a cunning politician, better than to be a cunning priest.\nHumbleness has such a blessing. Simplicity has such a benediction.\nSolomon Fiegenbaum came home one evening and was startled to find a young girl ransacking his apartment. Looking at her sternly, he said, \"Young woman, you are a thief! I am going to call the police.\"\n\"Please, sir,\" she pleaded, \"if I get in trouble again, I will be put away for years. Please don't call the police.\"\n\"I'm very sorry, but I have to,\" replied Sollie.\n\"Please, sir,\" she begged him tearfully, \"I will do anything for you. I will even give you my body.\"\nSollie thought for a moment. \"Okay,\" he said, \"take off your clothes and get into my bed.\"\nThe girl did so and Sollie quickly followed. He tried and tried and tried for about half an hour. Exhausted, he finally gave up.\n\"It's no use,\" Sollie cried, \"I just can't make it. I will have to call the police.\" Such cunning people... but the world is full of them. Be simple like a small child\n-- that is the idea of Dostoevsky in THE IDIOT.\nElmer, aged nine, was puzzled over the girl problem and discussed it with his\nfriend, Ernie.\n\"I've walked her to school three times,\" said Elmer, \"and carried her books, and I have bought her an ice cream twice. Now, do you think I ought to kiss her?\"\n\"No, you don't need to,\" said Ernie. \"You have already done enough for that girl.\"\nChildren have a beauty, and they have an insight which, as you grow old, you lose.\nThe village priest approached a group of small boys sitting in a circle around a dog.\nWhen he came up to them, he asked, \"What are you doing to the dog?\" Little Ernie answered, \"Whoever tells the biggest lie, wins the dog.\"\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed the priest, \"I'm surprised at you boys. When I was young like you, I never told a lie.\"\nThere was silence for a while, until little Ernie shouted out, \"Give him the dog!\"\nThe printed sign on the church lawn said, IF TIRED OF SIN -- COME IN. Scrawled underneath in lipstick, IF NOT, CALL THE STAR HOTEL AND ASK FOR LUCY.\nOkay Vimal? Yes, Osho.\nTable of Contents Chapter title: Into the open sky\nChapter title: Suddenly you have [blossomed]{style=” color: #00F; font-family:\"Times New Roman\", serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: underline; font-size: 14pt;“} {style=” color: #00F; font-family:\"Times New Roman\", serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 14pt;“} Chapter title: Expectation breeds [frustration]{style=” color: #00F; font-family:\"Times New Roman\", serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: underline; font-size: 14pt;“} {style=” color: #00F; font-family:\"Times New Roman\", serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 14pt;“} Chapter title: Drunk with [awareness]{style=” color: #00F; font-family:\"Times New Roman\", serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: underline; font-size: 14pt;“} {style=” color: #00F; font-family:\"Times New Roman\", serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 14pt;“} Chapter title: Innocence regained\n\u003c Previous | Contents\n","wordCount":"13908","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_great_pilgrimage_from_here_to_here/part8/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_great_pilgrimage_from_here_to_here/>The Great Pilgrimage From Here to Here</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: Become the mystery</h1><div class=post-meta>66 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;13908 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Great_Pilgrimage_From_Here_to_Here/part8.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part7>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a></p><h2 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=chapter-title-become-the-mystery><span id=bookmark14>‌</span>Chapter title: Become the mystery<span id=bookmark15>‌</span></h2><p>3 October 1987 am in Gautam the Buddha Auditorium Archive</p><p>code:</p><p>8710030</p><p>ShortTitle:</p><p>PILGR27</p><p>Audio:</p><p>Yes Video:</p><p>Yes Length:</p><p>123</p><p>mins Question 1</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>CAN YOU SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THE MYSTERY OF WOMEN?</p><p>Devageet, it is one of the ancientmost questions. Man has always
puzzled about women, and the real problem is neither man nor woman.
Reduced to the factual, to the existential, the problem is between the
head and the heart.</p><p>The head cannot understand the mystery of the heart. The head is
logical,</p><p>rational, mathematical, scientific; the heart knows nothing of
reason, nothing of logic. The heart functions in a totally different
way. Its functioning creates in the head the idea of the mystery. It is
not a question about women; it is a question that arises because women
function through the heart and man functions through the head. Have you
ever heard any women asking, "What is the mystery of man?" They simply
know it.</p><p>The problem arises out of logical reasoning. It is a very superficial
phenomenon. It is good with objects, with dead things; it deals with
them perfectly because a dead thing has no interiority, a dead thing has
no inner being, it has no life. The scientist is perfectly right about
objects, but the moment he comes to think about subjectivity -- the
interiority</p><p>-- he is baffled, because reason cannot function there.</p><p>The heart knows without any process of knowing, without any
syllogism, without any argument. How do you know that the rose is
beautiful? Is it a rational conclusion? If you bring reason in, you will
not be able to prove that the rose is beautiful, because reason cannot
fathom the phenomenon of beauty.</p><p>When you say the rose is beautiful, you are functioning from the
heart. When you say the starry night overwhelms you, it is not a
rational statement; if you are forced to prove it rationally, you will
be at a loss. Then suddenly you will become aware that it was the heart
that has spoken, and the head is absolutely incapable of figuring out
how the heart functions.</p><p>But the heart is not in the same difficulty about the head, because
the head is superficial and the heart is deep down within you. The lower
cannot understand the higher. The higher simply understands the lower,
there is no need of any reasoning. Your heart is both higher than your
head and deeper than your head. The woman can be a poet, but cannot
really be a mathematician. Mathematics is purely a game of the mind.
Poetry is a totally different phenomenon.</p><p>I am reminded of Frau Einstein, Albert Einstein's wife. She was a
poet, and Albert Einstein was perhaps the greatest scientific thinker of
all the ages. Naturally Frau Einstein wanted her husband to know about
her poetry. Einstein tried to avoid the subject as much as he could, but
finally one night, the full moon in the sky, Frau Einstein could not
resist the temptation. She had composed a beautiful poem about the full
moon, and she recited the poem.</p><p>Albert Einstein looked at her with great surprise, almost shocked.
She could not understand, "Why is he looking at me in this weird manner?
At the most he can say that the poetry is not great... but he is looking
at me as if I am insane!" After the recital of the poem she asked Albert
Einstein, "What do you think?"</p><p>He said, "I had never thought that you are so crazy. You talk about
the moon as beautiful, you talk about the moon reminding you of your
beloved. It is sheer nonsense! The moon is too big, it cannot be
substituted for your beloved. And the moon is not at all beautiful!</p><p>It is just as ordinary as the earth, even more ordinary because there
is no greenery, no water, just barren land. And the light that you see
reflected from the moon is not its own.</p><p>That light is borrowed from the sun, it is not coming from the moon.
The sunlight falls on the moon and the rays are reflected back, and
those reflected rays are coming to your eyes;the moon is not the source
of them. I had always thought that you are well educated, but you don't
know even the ABC of physics!"</p><p>Now was the chance for Frau Einstein to look at him as if he is
insane, because for centuries poets have sung songs about the moon --
its beauty, its tremendous magnetic force, its cool light. It has a
certain hypnotic spell on the heart... and it is now also proved by
facts that it has a certain hypnotic spell.</p><p>More people -- in fact all except Mahavira -- have become enlightened
on a full- moon night. Mahavira is the only exception; he became
enlightened on a no- moon night.</p><p>Gautam Buddha was born on a full-moon night, became enlightened on a
full- moon night, died on a full-moon night. He is a perfect example of
the hypnotic spell of the moon. Many more people go mad on the full-moon
night -- these are approved statistics -</p><p>- and more people commit suicide on full-moon nights.</p><p>The full moon somehow drives man's mind into dimensions beyond
reasoning. And it is not only man that is affected by the full moon;
even the ocean is affected. But a physicist, a mathematician will not be
able to understand it -- and Frau Einstein never again mentioned poetry
to Albert Einstein in her whole life.</p><p>Although she went on composing, she was not publishing them. It was
decided on the first recital that that kind of dialogue is not possible
between her and her husband -- but it is not any exceptional case.</p><p>No husband and no wife are in the situation of understanding each
other.</p><p>Misunderstanding is the natural situation. The man says something,
the woman immediately understands something else. The man cannot believe
how she has come to this conclusion -- and to the woman that conclusion
is absolutely clear, there is no doubt about it. And whatever she says,
the man is at a loss to figure it out.</p><p>Psychologists have started calling couples intimate enemies. They
are... because no one understands each other. But the reason is not the
woman and the man. The reason is far deeper. It is the head and the
heart.</p><p>So I would like to emphasize the point, Devageet, that the question
from the very beginning has been formed in a wrong way. It is not the
mystery of women, it is the mystery of the heart -- which the head is
incapable of figuring out. The heart has no problem about the head;it is
a lower, more superficial layer, and the heart understands it.</p><p>So when men say that women are mysteries, women simply smile amongst
themselves:Look at these idiots! Have you ever heard any woman saying
that women are mysteries? They know each other perfectly well. There is
no mystery.</p><p>It will be better to understand in a different dimension too. Forget
about man and woman; just think about your own head and your own heart.
Do they have a communion? Are they capable of understanding each other?
I have not met Albert Einstein, but I would have loved to meet him for
the simple reason that I wanted to ask him how he fell in love with Frau
Einstein. What physics, what mathematics, what science is behind the
experience of falling in love?</p><p>But perhaps he never thought about it. Love is coming from the heart;
it cannot come from the head. Even the greatest scientist once in a
while goes astray from the head. One beautiful sunset and he is
overwhelmed. He forgets that he is a scientist and he is not allowed to
do such things, feminine things; he is a male mind. And every scientist
falls in love with a woman without ever thinking what love is. It is a
mystery... even your own heart is a mystery to you.</p><p>My own understanding is that Mahavira at first denied any women to be
initiated into sannyas. The same was the case with Gautam Buddha;he
denied women to be initiated into sannyas. And the same is the case with
other religions; they have all put woman in a secondary place. And the
reason, according to me, is that all our so-called religions are
head-oriented... too much head. Their God is not their love, their God
is their idea. It is a hypothesis. They have created a system --
rational, logical, flawless -- but it is their own mind which is
creating the system. It is not a discovery. It is not unveiling the
mystery of existence.</p><p>And why have all these religions been so afraid of women? There were
other reasons, but the most fundamental reason is that all the founders
of religions were male, and their theologies were from the head. To
allow women among their fellow travelers was to create unnecessary
trouble, because they speak different languages, they understand
different languages. They are coming from different spaces. At the most,
they can tolerate each other.</p><p>That is what is happening between every wife and every husband: they
are just tolerating each other. There seems to be no possibility of a
sane conversation. Any conversation between a wife and husband
immediately leads to conflict, and the woman starts behaving, according
to man, in such a crazy way... throwing things, breaking things. He
cannot understand -- what argument is this? But the woman knows
perfectly well that only this argument will decide the thing -- and it
decides! The man simply agrees, "You are right, but just don't destroy
more things!" In every argument with a woman, the woman is the winner,
although she knows nothing about argumentation.</p><p>The day he initiated the first woman into sannyas, Gautam Buddha
said, "My religion was going to last for five thousand years. Now it
will last only five hundred years" -- not a great welcome to the poor
woman!</p><p>Asked why he was saying so, he said, "It is impossible to include
both women and men without them coming into conflict. The religion will
destroy itself from within. If it had remained just confined to males
there was a possibility for it to continue at least for five thousand
years, because they can understand each other."</p><p>You have to be very alert about it.… I am the first man who makes no
difference between initiating men and women, and my feeling is -- if I
were to reply to Gautam Buddha, I would say, "If it was only males it
would last for only five</p><p>hundred years. Now it is men and women together it can last for
eternity."</p><p>When heart and head are together, you are more complete and more
whole. Heart is a part, head is a part, but together... if a communion
is possible, your strength is not doubled, it is multiplied. How can the
head and the heart come to a point of meeting?</p><p>And it is a multidimensional question:</p><p>It is between the woman and the man. It is between the heart and the
head.</p><p>It is between the East and the West.</p><p>One of the royal poets of England, Rudyard Kipling, has written two
famous lines which have become better known than anything else that he
wrote. Those lines are, "East is East and West is West, and never the
twain shall meet." Nobody has argued against it... and he was the royal
poet of the British Empire.</p><p>But I disagree absolutely, without any conditions and reservations,
because wherever you are standing East and West are meeting. Bombay is
West to Calcutta, Calcutta is East to Bombay;Tokyo is East to Calcutta,
and Calcutta is West to Tokyo. Wherever you are, you cannot say you are
in the East or in the West. They are relative terms;they are not fixed
territories. Wherever you are, in every man, in every tree, in every
bird, East and West are meeting.</p><p>Rudyard Kipling is simply talking nonsense! But he has a point in his
ridiculous statement -- and the point is the same. The West is
head-oriented and the East is heart-oriented. It is the same question in
different directions: How can they meet? How can there be an intimate
love between the head and the heart, not intimate enmity? -- it is a
contradiction in terms.</p><p>They meet in meditation, because in meditation the head is empty and
the heart is empty: the head is empty of thoughts and the heart is empty
of feelings. When there are two emptinesses you cannot keep them
separate, because there is nothing between them to keep them separate.
Two zeros become one zero... Two nothingnesses cannot exist separately;
they are bound to become one because there is not even a fence between
them.</p><p>But Rudyard Kipling, although he lived in India almost his whole
life, has never heard about meditation. It is meditation in which the
head and heart lose each other, melt into each other. It is meditation
in which man and woman melt into each other.</p><p>In India we have an ancient, very ancient statue -- one of the most
beautiful pieces of art -</p><p>- a statue of Ardhanarishwar. The statue is half man and half woman.
It is the statue of Shiva, the Hindu God, and half of the body is of the
woman and the other half of the body is of the man. Up to the time of
Carl Gustav Jung it was thought that it is only a mythology, metaphor,
poetry -- but this cannot be true. The whole credit goes to Carl Gustav
Jung for introducing to the world that this is not a metaphor, this is a
reality.</p><p>Every man and every woman are both, because every child is born of a
father and a mother. So something of the mother and something of the
father is present in every child, whether the child is a girl or the
child is a boy. The only difference can be that the man is a little more
man, perhaps fifty-one percent man and forty-nine percent woman, and the
woman is fifty-one percent woman and forty-nine percent man. But the
difference is not much.</p><p>That's why it has become scientifically possible to change the sexes
-- because the other sex is also present, just the percentage of
hormones has to be changed. What was fifty-one percent has to be made
forty-nine, or what was forty-nine has to be made fifty-one...</p><p>then the man becomes woman and the woman becomes man.</p><p>But even within you, you are not at ease. There is a conflict,
continuous conflict between the head and the heart, between the man and
the woman. This conflict can be dissolved only if the head drops its
thinking and the heart drops its feeling and both are just pure empty
spaces. In that emptiness there is a great meeting and a great
understanding.</p><p>I don't see any woman as a mystery. I have looked hard, and perhaps
there will not be another man in the whole world who has come in contact
with so many men and so many women. But neither the man seems to be a
mystery nor the woman seems to be a mystery, because within myself the
head and heart have melted into each other, and that has given me a new
perspective and has changed</p><p>the whole vision around me.</p><p>Devageet, if you really want to understand the mystery of women you
will have to understand the art of melting your head into your heart.
That will not only help you to know the mystery of women, it will also
help you to know the mystery of men. Not only that, it will help you to
know the mystery of the whole existence.</p><p>A shy young girl was about to get married, so she went to see her
very experienced friend for some advice.</p><p>"Doris," she began, "it may sound silly, but there are a few things I
just have to ask you."</p><p>"That's okay," said Doris. "Just go ahead."</p><p>"Okay," said the shy girl, "is it all right to talk to your husband
while making love?"</p><p>"Well," said Doris, "I must admit that I have never done that, but I
suppose there is nothing wrong in it -- as long as there is a telephone
within reach."</p><p>There is mystery but it is not confined only to women. The whole
existence is mysterious. This beautiful rain... this music of the
falling rain... the joy of the trees. Don't you think there is great
mystery?</p><p>There was a hill station in the state where I was a professor for
many years, and on that hill station was a resthouse far away deep in
the hills, absolutely lonely. For miles there was nobody... even the
servant who used to take care of the resthouse used to leave by the
evening for his own home. I used to go to that resthouse whenever I
could find time and sometimes it used to rain just like this... and I
was alone in that resthouse and for miles there was nobody. Just the
music of rain, just the dance of the trees... I have never forgotten the
beauty of it. Whenever it rains I again remember it. It has left such a
beautiful impact.</p><p>If you look, then each flower is a mystery. From where do those
colors come? Every rainbow is a mystery, every moment of life is a
mystery. Just to be here... is it not a mystery that you are nowhere
else but here?</p><p>Once your eyes are clear and your head and heart are no more in
conflict,</p><p>everything starts becoming mysterious. Then you don't want to
de-mystify it -- that is absolutely ugly and criminal! The mystery of
existence has to be welcomed as it is. Dissecting it, demystifying it,
is a violation, aggression, violence.</p><p>A man of meditation simply enjoys the flowers, the birds, the trees,
the rain, the sun, the moon, the people. It is good that we are all
engulfed in a mysterious whole. Life will be utterly boring if every
mystery is decoded.</p><p>Science's whole effort is to demystify existence. Poetry and art are
concerned in rejoicing, in welcoming the mystery of existence.And the
mystic, the religious man, lives the mystery -- not from the outside as
a poet, but from the very inside of it. He becomes himself mystery.</p><p>There is a beautiful story. Unfortunately it cannot be true. I would
have loved it to have been true...! In the East there have been many
lovers, very famous lovers</p><p>-- Heer and Ranjha, Sheeri and Farhad -- and the most famous is the
third couple, Laila and Majnu.</p><p>None of them could meet and live with each other. That is their great
fortune; hence they remained loving each other for their whole life.</p><p>Majnu was a poor man. Laila was a very rich, super-rich girl, and the
parents were not willing to give their only girl into the hands of
Majnu, who was nobody at all, just a beggar. Just to avoid him, and to
avoid any slander, the parents left the town for another city; they had
businesses in many cities and houses in many cities.</p><p>The day they left, Majnu was standing outside the city by the side of
a tree, hiding himself in the foliage of the tree, just to see for the
last time his beloved Laila moving away. He saw Laila on her camel, and
the whole caravan was moving away. He went on looking and looking as far
as he could, and in a desert you can see very far, there are no
obstructions.</p><p>Finally, beyond the horizon, they disappeared... but Majnu went on
looking. This is where the story becomes a myth, but of tremendous
significance. He never left that place.</p><p>He trusted his love, and he hoped that one day Laila will return from
the same route.</p><p>There was no other route going out from the town.</p><p>After twelve years, Laila returned. The father was dead and now she
was free at last. She never married anyone else; she had insisted that
if she was going to marry anyone, she would marry Majnu. Her father had
said, "If that is your decision, then my decision is that you will never
marry." But when the father died, Laila came.</p><p>Now twelve years is a long time. In these twelve years Majnu had been
standing by the side of the tree. The foliage had grown much; he had not
eaten, he had not drunk water, and by and by he had become joined with
the tree. Standing for twelve years was so long... slowly, slowly he
became part of the tree.</p><p>Laila came and she enquired about Majnu in the town. The people said,
"It is a very sad story. He had gone to say goodbye to you, but he never
came back. Only once in a while in the deep silences of the night, from
a certain tree, a sound comes calling your name:</p><p>`Laila, it is too long. When are you going to come back?' -- and
people have become afraid of the tree because it seems the tree is
haunted by ghosts or something. Nobody comes close to the tree."</p><p>Laila went to the tree. She heard the voice, she heard the joyful
welcome, but she could not see where Majnu was hiding. She entered into
the foliage of the tree. With great difficulty she could figure out that
Majnu had become part of the tree.</p><p>It cannot be factual... but the mystic becomes part of the mystery of
existence. And the story of Laila and Majnu is a Sufi story. Perhaps it
is symbolic of the ultimate union with existence.</p><p>Not trying to demystify it, but becoming a part of the mystery
yourself, that is the only true understanding. The mystery will remain
amystery, but by becoming yourself a mystery, you will understand.</p><p>That is the only true understanding. All other understandings are
only knowledge borrowed from others.</p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>IS MISUNDERSTANDING NATURAL TO THE HUMAN MIND?</p><p>Milarepa, misunderstanding is certainly natural to the human mind.
Mind is a misunderstanding, and through mind whatsoever you understand
is misunderstanding.</p><p>Understanding arises only when mind is absent, because what is mind
after all? -</p><p>- just a collection of thoughts, none of which is your experience.
Through that screen of collected thoughts, whatever you see you
interpret. You never see what is there, you only see what your mind can
interpret. And all interpretations are misunderstandings.</p><p>When there is no interpretation, you simply see the fact, the
truth... that which is. Then the mind does not distort, does not color,
does not give meanings to it. You don't have any mind; you are just an
opening, a mirror reflecting reality as it is.</p><p>What are the differences in the world between people? What is the
difference between a Christian and a Hindu, or a Buddhist and a
Mohammedan? Nobody is born as a Buddhist or a Christian or a Hindu. The
differences are only of the mind and you don't bring the mind with you
when you are born. It is all nurtured.</p><p>Your mind is created by the society you are born in, and of course
they create your mind for their own purposes. It is not for you but for
the society, for the state, for the church.</p><p>Your mind is a slave. Whoever has created it has created it for its
own purposes -</p><p>- to exploit you.</p><p>Every nation fills your mind with nationality. Every religion fills
your mind with the idea that even to die for your religion is the
greatest virtue or to kill for your religion is not a sin. All these
religions, all these nations, these political, social, religious
ideologies, go on conflicting, fighting. Man has not done anything much
on the earth except fighting or preparing for fighting. There are only
two periods in history: one is preparation for war, and the other is war
itself. Man has never known peace.</p><p>My history teacher in the high school was at a loss when I told him
this, because he was talking about periods of peace when there was no
war, and he was dividing history into war periods and peace periods. I
said, "I cannot agree with you because what do you do in your peace
time? -- you prepare for war. So I</p><p>would like to divide history into two periods: preparation for war,
and war itself."</p><p>He was a very nice gentleman, hence he was not angry. For a moment he
was silent and then he said, "Perhaps you are right. My whole life I
have been dividing history into these two periods... but you seem to be
more clear, because if there is a peace period, from where does the war
come in?"</p><p>The day we will have peace, then there will be no war. But up to now
we have not known peace. What is the reason for all this conflict and
war and violence and murders and massacres? The mind!</p><p>The world will know peace only when we have learnt how to go beyond
mind. Then you are not a Christian and you are not an Indian, you are
not a Chinese and you are not a communist. Then you are simply a human
being. In that utter purity of humanness, the world will come to know
exactly what peace is and what a celebration it brings with itself.</p><p>Mind as such is nothing but misunderstanding. If you really want to
understand, get rid of the mind. But people do just the opposite: in
trying to understand they go on strengthening their minds. They think a
stronger mind -- more nourished, more reformed, more educated -- will be
able to understand. I have seen the most educated people, but their
Christianity remains there, their Hinduism remains there. Even the very
highly educated culture remains superstitious... and their
misunderstanding becomes even deeper. Now they have more refined
arguments for their misunderstanding.</p><p>One great Christian missionary, Stanley Jones used to stay with me.
He had fallen in love with me. He was an old man and a world famous
missionary, very educated, very refined and sophisticated. But I asked
him one day, "The only thing that puzzles me is that with so much
information and so much sophistication, you are still a Christian, you
have not yet become just human. Deep down you still think that
Christianity is the only true religion, that all other religions are
so-so... they may be faraway echoes of truth, but Christianity has the
monopoly of truth.</p><p>"Even with your understanding you have not been able to see that
Jesus Christ cannot be compared to Gautam Buddha. Jesus Christ remains a
Jew, dies a Jew. He had no idea that his crucifixion would become the
beginning of a new</p><p>religion. He had never thought beyond the boundaries of Jewish
thinking. Gautam Buddha was a rebel. He was born a Hindu, but he
renounced Hinduism. By renouncing Hinduism, he renounced the whole mind
that the Hindus had given to him. He became clear and pure, just a child
again. That makes him a totally unique and different person than all
other religious people."</p><p>Stanley Jones said to me, "Whenever you argue for anything, you argue
well! But there are reasons which cannot be dispelled by argument."</p><p>I said, "What kind of reasons?"</p><p>He said, "I cannot refute you on this point, but in the deepest part
of me I cannot put anybody above Jesus Christ."</p><p>I said, "This is what I call the mind. You don't have any argument,
but still you have a conditioning so deep... with this conditioning you
cannot look around the world with open eyes, unprejudiced,
impartial.</p><p>"You go on arguing against other religions without any difficulty.
You go on finding superstitions in Hindus, in Mohammedans, in Jainas, in
Buddhists, but I have never heard you talk about the superstitions of
Christians. Do you mean to say that they don't have any superstitions?
Or is it simply that your mind cannot conceive of it because it has been
created by Christians? In Christian colleges, in theological trainings,
your mind has been completely filled with Christian ideas, and you think
it is your mind. In fact you are being used."</p><p>But this is the situation. People think they need a greater mind to
understand. I want you to see it clearly: you need no mind if you want
to understand. You need only a meditative silent space.</p><p>Question 3 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>AM I REALLY A GOOD THERAPIST?</p><p>Prasad, to be a good therapist is a very difficult job. A good
therapist has to be immensely compassionate, because it is not his
techniques of therapy that help people, it is his love. There is nothing
compared to love as far as healing the wounds of a man's being are
concerned. All other techniques can be helpful,</p><p>supportive, but the basic is not a technique but a loving heart.</p><p>A therapist cannot be a professional. The moment a therapist becomes
professional things start going wrong, because the profession of therapy
means that the patient should never be cured. He should be given hope
but he should never be cured, because once you cure him you have lost
one customer. The physician or the therapist, their profession is very
strange.</p><p>I have heard about an old doctor. His son came back from the medical
college, fresh, and he told the father, "Now you have become old and I
can take charge of all your patients.</p><p>You can rest. If I need any advice I will ask you."</p><p>The father said, "I was waiting for this. You are now well educated.
You know more than I know, you know the latest researches in medicine,
but if I can be of any help, I will be available."</p><p>After three days the father asked the son how things were going. He
said, "Great, just great. The woman you have been treating for thirty
years for arthritis I have cured within three days."</p><p>The father said, "My god! You are an idiot. That woman is so rich,
she can afford to remain uncured for her whole life. And how do you
think I was supporting you in the university? That woman has provided
money for your education, and that woman was going to provide money for
your younger brother. That woman was almost a goldmine."</p><p>The son was shocked. He said, "What are you saying?"</p><p>The father said, "You are young, you don't understand. This
profession is a contradiction.</p><p>You have to cure, but in such a way that the cure takes as long as
possible." The poor get cured sooner, the richer get cured on a long
term basis...!</p><p>And psychotherapy in particular is in an even more dangerous
contradiction. There is not a single person in the whole world who is
totally psychoanalyzed. In the first place, psychoanalysts are making
great earnings; they are the most</p><p>highly paid professionals in the world. They cannot afford to lose
rich patients -- and they have only rich patients.</p><p>Poor countries don't suffer from any diseases which psychoanalysis
can help. When people are hungry, what can psychoanalysis do?
Psychoanalysis comes only when people are so rich they don't know what
to do with their money. Then psychoanalysis comes in and shows them what
to do with it -- be psychoanalyzed!</p><p>Prasad, a good therapist is one who avoids being a professional. It
should be part of your love, not part of your business; only then can
you be a good therapist. And as far as I know, you are one of the best
therapists around here. I don't see in you things which lead therapists
astray. One is a certain kind of gurudom. A therapist should not become
a guru, because the moment you become a guru you start changing your
patients into your disciples, you start exploiting their misery for your
own aggrandizement, for your own ego. You start playing a role of being
superior to you, higher than you.</p><p>I have not seen in your eyes that ugly ego which changes helping
people into exploiting people. I have seen so many therapists who sooner
or later fall into the trap. Because they know something more than the
ordinary normal human being, they are in a position to exploit, they are
in a position to create a following. That is not the work of the
therapist.</p><p>The work of the therapist is to help the patient to drop his
tensions, to drop his unnecessary problems, to drop his habit of
creating problems. Most of the patients that come to you are
hypochondriacs; they are not suffering from any real problem. Seventy
percent of their problems are just imaginary.</p><p>I have seen people looking into medical periodicals, medical
encyclopedias to find out what kind of disease they have -- they don't
have any disease! But it seems, particularly in the most advanced
countries, women are bragging... just as they used to brag in the past
about their ornaments, about their mink coats, about their houses, about
their luxuries, now they are bragging about psychoanalysis: "Who is your
psychoanalyst?" --</p><p>some poor guy or some great psychoanalyst, only very few people can
afford his services... And it becomes an addiction, particularly in
societies where people don't have time to listen to anybody, where
everybody is in a rush.</p><p>Bertrand Russell mentions in his autobiography, "The way
psychoanalysis is growing, I can predict that in the next century, if
man still remains on the earth, there will be psychoanalysts on every
street in the world."Everybody will need once in a while to go to the
psychoanalysts -- not because he has a disease, not that he has some
mental problem, but just to talk.Nobody listens, nobody has time. You
have to pay the psychoanalyst for listening.</p><p>In fact, if you are attentively listening to somebody a subtle help
happens. He unburdens himself; things that he cannot say to other people
he can say to you, because it is part of your work that you will keep it
secret, that you will not start gossiping about it. So in privacy and
secrecy he can open his heart, his wounds which he goes on hiding in the
society. And by hiding the wounds, you can never cure them. By exposing
them to light they are cured.</p><p>I have heard about a young psychotherapist who was working as an
assistant to a famous old psychoanalyst. He used to get bored because
people were coming with the same dreams, the same problems, the same
worries... every day from morning till evening you have to listen and
listen and listen, and it becomes heavy, so heavy that even in the night
you cannot sleep. You have listened so much that until it gets settled
you cannot sleep.</p><p>But he had never seen the old man ever feeling tired or bored.</p><p>So one day, getting out of the office, in the elevator, the young man
asked the old psychoanalyst, "What is your secret? You must have been in
psychoanalysis for almost sixty years -- sixty years of listening to all
kinds of garbage and crap! I have just been here for three months, and I
am tired and finished and I am thinking I have to change the profession.
These people will drive me crazy!"</p><p>The old man laughed and he said, "Who listens? There is no need to
listen. Just pretend."</p><p>That's why Sigmund Freud has devised a beautiful couch. The patient
lies on the couch, and behind the couch -- the patient cannot see --
sits the psychoanalyst. Whether he is there or not does not matter. Once
in a while he goes out and comes in, and the psychoanalysis continues.
The man goes on talking about his dreams, about his worries, about his
problems, uncoiling his mind, and he feels better. The psychoanalyst is
not doing anything; he is simply giving his time and pretending to be
attentive.</p><p>But this becomes an addiction. The patient has to come twice or
thrice a week because so much goes on gathering in his head that he has
to unburden it. But I will not call that old man a good therapist. He is
simply exploiting the weaknesses and the frailties of human beings.</p><p>Prasad, be attentive, be respectful, be loving. That makes a good
therapist. The patient is not different from you. You are in the same
boat. You not only allow him to open his heart, you also open your heart
to him to give him a feeling that he is not alone in his suffering, that
perhaps everybody in the world is suffering and hiding it.</p><p>The good therapist will create a friendliness, a deep intimacy with
the patient. He should not remain on a high pedestal, far above, as if
he has no problems. The fact is therapists have more problems than
anybody else. They have their own problems and they have other people's
problems too; hence four times more therapists go insane than any other
profession, and four times more therapists commit suicide than any other
profession. It is not just accidental.</p><p>But if you can be friendly, if you can hold the hand of the patient,
if you can tell him that these are your problems too and it is good to
have a companion, to have a friend, "We can work it out together. It is
not only that you will be helped, I will be helped also..."</p><p>Unless a therapist comes to this humbleness, he is not going to help.
And I can see in your eyes the possibility of this humbleness.</p><p>In the middle of her psychiatric session, Mrs. Blossom suddenly
exclaimed, "Doctor, I simply can't resist you! How about a little
kiss?"</p><p>"Absolutely not!" the doctor replied indignantly. "That would be
contrary to the ethics of my profession. Now continue what you were
telling me."</p><p>"Well, as I was saying," the patient reluctantly resumed, "I am
always having arguments with my husband about his father, and just
yesterday... I am sorry, doctor, I just can't go on talking. I have this
overwhelming impulse. Come on! What harm would there be if you gave me
just one little kiss?"</p><p>"That's absolutely impossible!" the doctor snapped. "In fact, I
should not even be lying here on this couch with you!"</p><p>Patients are being exploited sexually, financially, in every possible
way. The patient has to be given as much respect and dignity as you can
manage. You should be a humble helper, not a savior, then you can help
people immensely. You can be a good therapist.</p><p>You have to be.</p><p>My therapists have to be in a different way than the therapists in
the outside world. There they are business people. Here you are helping
your fellow travelers, your brothers, your sisters. And by helping them,
you are helping yourself because their problems and your problems are
not different.</p><p>The village idiot was very famous. His name was Elmer. One day a
village resident wanted to show a visiting friend just what an idiot
Elmer was.</p><p>"Watch this," he said. "Hey, Elmer! I have got something for you." He
then held out his hand, and on the outstretched palm were a nickel and a
dime. "Go ahead, Elmer," he said,</p><p>"take one."</p><p>So Elmer said, "Thank you, I will take the big one," and picked up
the nickel. The man winked at his friend and then said, "See what an
idiot he is?"</p><p>But as Elmer shuffled off, the visitor felt sorry for him and ran
after him.</p><p>"Listen, Elmer," he said earnestly, "don't you know that the small
coin is worth twice as much as the big one?"</p><p>"Of course I do," said Elmer, "but the first time I pick up the dime,
they will stop playing the game."</p><p>Even idiots are not so much idiots as you think; they have their own
intelligence. Your patients are not just to be treated objectively. You
have to bridge yourself with your patient. You have to become a friend
before you can be a therapist -- and particularly the therapists who are
working in the field of sannyas. Their function is not the same as the
function of the psychotherapist in the outside world.</p><p>In the outside world, psychotherapy is nothing but a strategy of the
society to keep people within their normal limits; the psychologist,
psychoanalyst, therapist are all helping the society. Whenever somebody
starts going beyond the normal standards, they pull him back down. It is
not necessarily helpful... One can go below mind, and then it is good to
pull him up. But if somebody is going beyond mind, then to pull him down
is not a help.</p><p>It is just the opposite of help.</p><p>Here within my field therapy is used only as a cleaning process. It
is just preparing the ground, taking out the wild weeds, the stones, so
that I can manage to bring the roses of meditation into your life. Here
therapy is only a preparation for meditation; its function is totally
different from in the outside world. There you have to bring the person
back into mind. Here you have to help the person to be courageous so
that he can step beyond mind.</p><p>You are preparing people for me. The ultimate push is going to be
through me. You have just to give them courage and encouragement. This
can be done not by being special, not by being higher, not by being
holier. You are not priests and you are not professionals.</p><p>You are just fellow travelers in this vast caravan, and you have to
help people, prepare people because now there is a gap that never used
to be in the past.</p><p>Buddha never needed any psychotherapy for his sannyasins; those
people were innocent.</p><p>But in these twenty-five centuries, people have lost their innocence,
they have become too knowledgeable. People have lost their contact with
existence. They have become uprooted.</p><p>I am the first person who uses therapy but whose interest is not
therapy but meditation, just as it was with Chuang Tzu or Gautam Buddha.
They never used therapy because there was no need. People were simply
ready, and you could bring the rosebushes without clearing the ground.
The ground was already clear.</p><p>In these twenty-five centuries man has become so burdened with
rubbish, so many wild weeds have grown in his being that I am using
therapy just to clean the ground, take away the wild weeds, the roots,
so the difference between the ancient man and the modern man is
destroyed.</p><p>The modern man has to be made as innocent as the ancient man, as
simple, as natural. He has lost all these great qualities. The therapist
has to help him -- but his work is only a preparation. It is not the
end. The end part is going to be the meditation.</p><p>As far as you are concerned, Prasad, you are doing perfectly well.
Okay, Vimal?</p><p>Yes, Osho.</p><p>The Great Pilgrimage: From Here to Here Chapter #28</p><p>Chapter title: Education for life -- and for death</p><p>3 October 1987 pm in Gautam the Buddha Auditorium Archive</p><p>code: 8710035</p><p>ShortTitle: PILGR28</p><p>Audio: Yes Video: Yes Length: 103</p><p>mins Question 1</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>I STILL STUDY IN SCHOOL AND I WANT TO KNOW: WHAT IS THE SECRET OF</p><p>EDUCATION?</p><p>Maya, it may be a little difficult for you to understand the secret
of education. But I cannot come down from my vision, so I will tell what
I feel is the secret, knowing perfectly well perhaps you may not be able
to understand it yet, you are too young. But through you perhaps others
may understand, and one day you will also grow up and be in a position
to understand it.</p><p>The question is very complex and I can see that you have asked it
without knowing its implications. It is the question that is one of the
most fundamental for the future of man. I would like to begin from the
very beginning.</p><p>Up to now, man has been living an accidental life. No one knows what
your potential is, what you are supposed by nature to be. And the
question -- the secret of education --</p><p>cannot be decided without knowing what your potential is. Are you
going to become a musician? a poet? an engineer? a doctor? Without
knowing anything about your possibilities, almost groping in the dark,
we go on deciding people's destiny for strange reasons.</p><p>The very word education, in its roots, means to draw out. It has the
very secret in its root-meaning. Whatever is within you as a seed has to
be drawn out, given full opportunity, so that it can blossom. But no one
knows what is hidden within you, what kind of soil you need and what
kind of gardener, what is the right climate and the right season and the
right time for you to be sown.</p><p>Parents decide about their children according to their own ambitions.
Somebody wanted to be very rich and could not be: he is hoping through
his children that his ambitions should be fulfilled. Although he could
not manage it, he will manage through his children. Naturally he would
not like his children to move in</p><p>directions where possibilities of becoming rich are scarce. As a
musician you cannot earn much; as a flute-player you cannot compete with
engineers, with doctors, with politicians, with industrialists.</p><p>Naturally the parents who have been interested in money would like to
send their children into a certain pattern of education which brings
them the right qualification to be rich.</p><p>The decision is arbitrary. The person about whom it is being decided,
his potential has not even been taken into consideration. He may have
the potential of becoming a great dancer, or a great painter, he may not
have any greed for money, but you are forcing him into a direction where
greed for money is an essential to be successful.</p><p>Even if he succeeds... of which there is not much chance, because
unless you have an inner urge, an instinct for money, the chances of
your success are rare. You will be a failure, and your life will become
a long, drawn-out misery. But if by chance you succeed and you become
rich, still your misery will not be dropped, because you never wanted to
be rich in the first place. This was not your destiny. You are living
somebody else's life --</p><p>how can you be happy? You are trying to fulfill somebody else's
ambition and you are not in a position to fulfill your own nature.</p><p>Hence the immense misery in the world: the person who could have been
a great musician has become just a pigmy industrialist. A person who
could have been a great mystic has been forced to become a
mathematician. Almost everybody is in the wrong place. And to be in the
wrong place is very painful. You yourself are not aware of why you are
suffering, because you yourself are not aware that you have missed your
target.</p><p>You are following somebody else's idea of what you should be.</p><p>So the first thing, according to me, begins with genetic engineering.
There lies the secret of all education. Up to now what we have been
calling education is a chaos.</p><p>People have been consulting astrologers about what their children
should be. Now stars are not interested in your children -- I don't see
any possibility that stars are even aware of your children. That the
congregation of stars in a certain</p><p>position is going to give your child a certain potential is an
unproved hypothesis. Millions of children are born in the world almost
at the same moment, but those millions of children cannot have the same
destiny although the stars were the same.</p><p>It is such a far-fetched idea that stars can decide your life. And if
stars are deciding, then they are deciding in an insane way. Life on the
earth shows that the decisions made about man are made wrongly,
whosoever is making them.</p><p>People consult palmists, who decide by reading the lines of the hand.
It is all sheer nonsense! Birth-charts cannot say anything about you,
but all marriages are made by consulting birth-charts... and you can see
what those birth-charts are doing! I used to live in a city for a few
years, and just opposite me lived a very famous astrologer who was
deciding people's marriages by reading their birth- charts. As we were
living opposite each other, it did not take long to get introduced to
him.</p><p>I told him, "Do you really believe that what you are doing is
sane?"</p><p>He said, "What do you mean? I am the best astrologer around this
area. People come to me from hundreds of miles away."</p><p>I said, "That I can see myself. But I also see that your wife beats
you. Did you look at your birth-charts when you got married to this
woman? And if you could not decide even for yourself, don't you feel
ashamed that what you are doing is simply stupid -- and not only stupid,
inhuman?"</p><p>He was at a loss. I said, "Remember, I am a strange man. I will
spread this news to everybody, and I will sit in the front of my garden
to prevent people coming to you. I will tell them what is happening in
your life."</p><p>At that very moment his wife came in from the kitchen and she said,
"You are right. I will support you. This man is simply an idiot. He
knows nothing; he has destroyed my life, he has destroyed his life, and
he is destroying thousands of other people's lives!"</p><p>But this goes on. There are people who will consult the I-Ching, who
will consult the Tarot cards... But the real thing is somewhere else.
And it is known, but religious prejudices are preventing humanity from
using it.</p><p>The secret is in genetic engineering. Now it is scientifically
possible to find the program of each human being, even before his birth.
The male sperm carries many of the programs for his life and what he can
become; whether he will be male or female, whether he will be a
strong-bodied man or a weakling, whether he will live a life of health
or will remain continually sick, his resistance against disease, how
long he will live... and what kinds of potentialities are hidden in him
-- whether he can become a great mathematician or a great painter or a
great poet or a great industrialist. Your destiny is written in the
biological beginnings of your life, not in the birth-chart, nor in the
stars, nor in the lines of your hands.</p><p>Now there are scientific openings to a new world: each sperm can be
read almost like an open book. You can decide your child's life. Before
he is born, you can choose what you want your child to be. To me, the
real education begins from there.</p><p>In each lovemaking the man releases at least one million sperms, but
only one sperm may be able to reach the female egg. It is a marathon
race. The small sperm -- which is not visible to the bare eyes -- in
proportion to his size, the track that he has to follow towards the
mother's egg is almost two miles long, and he has only two hours'
lifespan. So if he does not reach within two hours, he will die. Such
competition he will never again face in his life.</p><p>The whole life will be competitive, but the beginning is the worst
competition you can conceive: one million people rushing towards the
female egg, and only one is going to win the race! The remainder are
going to die.</p><p>Rarely it happens that two sperms reach at the same time -- that's
why twins are born.</p><p>Sometimes even nine children have been given birth to by a woman,
because nine sperms reached at the same time. The reason is this: the
female egg remains open only for the first sperm reaching to it. The
moment the sperm has entered the egg, the egg automatically becomes
hard, it is no more porous, so others reaching are rejected. But if two
reach at the same time, then their entry is possible because the egg is
still porous.</p><p>Now it is a blind game -- most probably the idiots will reach first.
That's why the world is full of idiots! The idiots will not take any
care, any consideration of anybody; they will simply rush blindly with
full force. The wiser ones may stand</p><p>by the side and see what is happening. The really wise ones may not
even participate in the race, it is so stupid.</p><p>These problems can be solved. But religious superstitiousness is a
great barrier in the world for every kind of progress and new idea.</p><p>I will be opposed by all the religions -- it does not matter, I have
been opposed my whole life -- but my proposal is that every male who
wants children should donate his sperms to a hospital and the medical
science board should work out for those sperms what the possibilities
are.</p><p>In those one million sperms there may be Albert Einsteins, Bertrand
Russells, Martin Heideggers, great musicians like Yehudi Menuhin, great
dancers like Nijinsky, great philosophers like Friedrich Nietzsche,
great novelists like Fyodor Dostoevsky. They can be picked out and the
father and mother can choose what they want. When you can choose the
great diamonds, why go for the colored stones? And when you can be the
chooser, why be accidental?</p><p>They can choose, if they want, a Henry Ford, who will make great
riches possible.</p><p>Money is an art, just as anything else; it has its own geniuses.
Everybody cannot be a Henry Ford!</p><p>If you want your child to be a Gautam Buddha, then you have to see,
according to the genetic analysis, which sperm has the potentiality of
being a mystic. The sperm has to be injected, so he need not be in
competition with all kinds of fellows in a crowd. From that choice
starts your education.</p><p>This is only the beginning of genetic engineering. Finally it is
going to happen, the work is growing every day... the chosen sperm has a
program, but the program can be changed a little bit. It may be possible
that he has the mind of an Albert Einstein, but not the body, not the
health -- that can be added, the program can be changed a little bit. He
may have just a life of fifty years, but that program can be changed. He
can be given as long a life as you want -- the maximum lifespan can be
almost three hundred years -- and as much health and as much resistance
against disease. All these things can be added to the program.</p><p>The child now starts the journey with the parents' full awareness of
what he is going to become, to what school he should be sent, and what
kind of education</p><p>he should be given according to the genetic code. Then the world will
be full of geniuses, talented people, healthy people. It is possible to
avoid old age completely... a man can go on living youthfully up to the
point of death.</p><p>Now these are not fictions, these have become scientific facts. But
religions are even preventing these scientific facts from being known to
the public, to the people. They are afraid of strange things. Their fear
is that morality will be disturbed. So let it be disturbed...! Anyway,
what kind of morality exists in the world? Except hypocrisy, there
exists no morality.</p><p>Genetic engineering can decide even the character, the morality, the
discipline of the individual who is going to be born. From there many
things become possible. For the child, a clearcut, non-accidental
career, and for the parents -- because the child is not be given birth
through sex -- sex becomes pure fun. It does not carry any
responsibility, any danger.</p><p>Now there are one hundred percent safe pills for males. For the women
the pill is not one hundred percent safe; she has to take it every day.
If she misses one day, because she is not thinking she will make love on
that day, then suddenly the husband turns up, or suddenly the husband is
gone... either way it works. The opportunity of love arises, and mind
tends to take chances. Mind just thinks, "Every time you make love you
don't become pregnant."</p><p>A man in the ordinary course of his sexual life has intercourse at
least four thousand times. That is the norm; I am not talking about sex
maniacs! This is the very average shop-keeper... four thousand times
means forty million people. Existence is really abundant. The man may
have only two or three children out of forty million people. Forty
million people can make a whole country.</p><p>Now they have developed two other pills. The first pill that they
have developed was a great revolution, because it prevented women from
becoming pregnant. In the past a woman's whole life was nothing but a
factory to produce children. She was continuously pregnant; her life was
nothing more than the life of a cow. So the first pill prevented her
being pregnant, but it was not one hundred percent safe.</p><p>The second pill is a greater revolution, because it can be taken
after you make love. The first was before you make love; the second is a
great advancement, because now you need not be worried; you can make
love whenever, with</p><p>whomsoever the possibility arises. And one never knows when the
possibility will knock on your door -- perhaps in a train, and you may
have forgotten to bring your pills and the possibility may not strike
again. It is just a stranger and suddenly you feel like this is the man
you are made for, he is made for you... although when the next station
comes, he will be gone. The next pill is a greater advancement: you can
take it afterwards.</p><p>The third pill is even more significant: the woman need not take it,
the man can take it.</p><p>Within these three pills all accidental birth can be avoided. Sex
becomes just a playfulness, loses all seriousness that it has carried in
the past; and you can get a child of which you can really be proud. You
can fill the whole earth with the right kind of people.</p><p>Criminals can be avoided, politicians can be avoided, priests can be
avoided, murderers can be avoided, rapists can be avoided, violent
people can be avoided, or if they have some special quality in them,
then their program can be changed, their violence can be taken out.
Rather than teaching people not to be violent, not to be thieves, not to
be criminals... For thousands of years we have been teaching and it
seems to have no effect.</p><p>On the other hand, we have been making laws against criminals. The
laws goes on becoming more and more complicated -- more courts, more
jails, more legal experts --</p><p>but nothing has been of any help. Criminals go on increasing. Our
whole approach is unscientific. If a child is born with a program of
being a murderer, you cannot do anything. No moral preaching is going to
help, no legal threat, "If you murder somebody, you will be sent to the
gallows," is going to help.</p><p>In England in the middle ages it was thought that if criminals were
punished in the middle of the town, so that the whole town can see what
happens if you steal or if you do something wrong, against the law...
Criminals were beaten, naked, and thousands of people were watching
them. The idea was that these thousands of people will get the idea that
stealing is dangerous: you have to stand naked before your whole town,
you lose all your dignity. Not only that, one thousand lashes... your
whole body starts losing blood, your skin is broken everywhere, it was
sheer humiliation, torture.</p><p>But the process had to be stopped, because then it was found that
when thousands of people were attentively watching a criminal being
tortured, thieves were working in the crowd, picking people's pockets.
When it was found that even in that crowd many people had lost the
contents of their pockets... they were so attentive that they forgot
about pockets and they forgot that there may be thieves Finally the
government came to the conclusion that this is not going to</p><p>help. If people are picking poeple's pockets while another thief is
being tortured, you cannot teach !</p><p>People have been sentenced to death in thousands, but it has not
prevented murderers.</p><p>The reason is that the murderer has a program in which he is not able
to make any change. It is intrinsic in his biology, in his physiology,
in his chemistry, about which he is not able to do anything. It is in
every cell of his body, and he will have to fulfill his destiny.</p><p>All your laws are stupid, all your courts are idiotic, and all your
lawmakers are utterly ignorant people. They want to do something which
no individual is capable of and which can be done only before the child
is conceived -- not afterwards. The world is full of blind people,
crippled people, paralyzed people, deaf people. They cannot respect
themselves.</p><p>Just the other day I received a letter from England. Now I feel at a
loss what to do. A young man... he is a sannyasin but he is so ugly that
people feel a kind of</p><p>repulsion, sickness, even to be near him. Now his biology demands
that he should fall in love with some woman, some woman should accept
him. But no woman even comes close to him.</p><p>He has written a letter, What should I do?</p><p>Now really he is not responsible for his ugly face; his parents
should have taken care. He had no necessity to be born; a beautiful face
could have been chosen, because even the face, the beauty, the color,
everything is in the program But</p><p>now it is too late, so what to say to him? No meditation can make him
beautiful.</p><p>Meditation can help him to go beyond this urge, biological urge, but
he does not want to go beyond the biological urge. His question is: "Why
am I deprived when everybody else is enjoying the love of somebody? What
sin have I committed?" He has not committed any sin, it is just that his
parents were</p><p>ignorant. The only thing that can be suggested to him is to go
through plastic surgery.</p><p>But there are blind people, there are deaf people, there are crippled
people, there are people who are retarded. They don't have any more
possibilities of intelligence -- and who is responsible for this? The
priests of all the religions have been deceiving humanity.</p><p>They are the great deceivers. They have been telling people, "You are
suffering from blindness, from crippledness, from paralysis because of
your past life's evil acts."</p><p>This is not true. The scientific truth is that people are
unnecessarily suffering because we are listening to the priests and not
to the scientists. The priests are absolutely against interfering as far
as human life is concerned. They start great protests immediately that
you should not interfere in the work of God.</p><p>But I cannot see what kind of work God is doing. Now what about this
young man who is created ugly? -- this is God's work? And all these
people who are retarded, stupid -- this is God's work? And the priests
are not ready to have a different world. They are against family
planning, they are against birth control, they are against everything
that man is now capable of doing to create a better world, a better
humanity.</p><p>So this is my first thing: education will never be right unless
children are born through genetic engineering, not through the old
bullock cart method that you have followed up to now. This is one of the
most significant secrets: unless we listen to sanity and intelligence,
we are not going to revolutionize human life.</p><p>Secondly, a few things about education. I want education to be
divided in two parts: the first part should be given in the beginning
and the second part should be given at the time a person retires.</p><p>The first part of education should be for attaining the highest
possible standard of livelihood. It should consist of the art of living
and love. It should teach people how to be total in their acts, how to
use the opportunity of life without losing anything, to squeeze every
drop of juice that existence provides. The first part will be for the
young people --</p><p>training for life and training for love, training for intensity,
training for totality.</p><p>The second part will be after retirement, which will depend how long
we can allow man to live. It may be according to the present average
lifespan, sixty years, seventy years --</p><p>but as the person retires. There are people in the area of Kashmir
occupied by Pakistan who have passed the one hundred and fiftieth year
-- thousands of people. That small area of Kashmir seems to be the most
healthy area. They are poor people, with no medical facilities, but even
at the age of one hundred and fifty, they are young.</p><p>But there are other places also in the world, particularly in the
Soviet Union, in Kazakhstan, in Azerbaijan, in the Caucasus, where
people have lived even longer -- one hundred and eighty years -- and
thousands of people, not just one. They are still working in the fields,
in the gardens, in the orchards; you cannot call them old, they are
still capable of producing children.</p><p>So it will depend... If genetic engineering succeeds in destroying
the superstitions of humankind, then the second part will come very
late. The second part will be preparation for death. Just as the first
part was preparation for life, the second part will be preparation for
death -- how to die meditatively, silently, peacefully; how to meet
death with a song and a dance and a welcome.</p><p>The second part will be basically religious, just as the first part
was basically scientific.</p><p>The education will be complete, but it has to be at both the ends --
the beginning and the end. Each university should have a double
structure: one for the young people who are going to enter into life,
and the other for the old people who are going to enter into the unknown
world of death.</p><p>The first part of education will be of many dimensions -- all
sciences, all arts, all kinds of crafts. Somebody is a great carpenter,
somebody is a great shoemaker, somebody is a great scientist, somebody
is a great moneymaker -- they are all contributing whatever their
potential allows them to life, with totality, not holding anything back.
Naturally they should have equal opportunity to grow, and they should
have equal respect. Just because a man is a president of a country does
not mean that he should have respect and the man who makes perfect shoes
should not. Both are fulfilling certain needs of the society; both
should have the same honor and the same dignity.</p><p>This equal opportunity, equal respect will begin from the very world
of education. And for education to make all these changes, education
will have to go through many changes itself.</p><p>For example, examinations should be dissolved, because examinations
emphasize people's memory, not their intelligence. Memory is not a great
thing; particularly in the future it is not going to be of any
importance. You can carry your small computer in your pocket which will
have all the memories that you need, and any time... immediately the
computer will supply. There is no need to fill your head with
unnecessary rubbish.</p><p>The computer is going to replace the whole system of education which
has depended up to now on memory. Whoever can memorize more comes first
class, gets a gold medal, tops the university. But have you ever thought
about what happens to these gold medalists in the world? They don't show
anywhere any genius. Somebody is just a head clerk, somebody is just a
stationmaster, somebody is a postmaster -- what happened to their gold
medals? What happened to the great respect that their university paid to
them?</p><p>In fact the university paid respect to their memories and memories
are of not much use in actual life. In actual life you need
intelligence. And the difference should be made clear to you. Memory is
a ready-made answer. But life goes on changing, it is never ready-made
-- so all your ready-made answers are lagging behind life.</p><p>Life needs a living response... not a ready-made answer, but a
spontaneous response this moment; it needs intelligence.</p><p>Up to now education systems have not been creating intelligence at
all. Intelligence needs a totally different kind of structure.
Examinations are for memory, they are a memory test of how much you can
memorize. But if questions are asked which you have not memorized, you
are at a loss. You don't have the intelligence to respond to a new
question for which the answer has not been memorized before.</p><p>The whole system of examinations is futile. A different structure
should be created: each student, every day, should get his credit marks
from the teacher to show if he is behaving intelligently, if he is
answering things intelligently -- not just a repetition of the
textbooks, but something original.</p><p>Originality should be respected and honored, not repetition -- not
being a carbon copy.</p><p>And there is no need to wait for one year; if a student can get
enough marks within six months, he should pass into a higher standard.
There is no question of anybody failing or anybody passing. Just as you
start getting closer to the standard beyond your standard...</p><p>there is no examination. Just with your teachers watching your
responses and your intelligence, you will be moving on. Somebody may
come one month later, somebody may come a few months later, but there is
no question of a fixed year program. I have been a teacher in the
university and I know.… There were students who were so talented that
they could have passed the whole course set for one year in two months;
now ten months are wasted. Who is responsible for that? And there were
retarded students; even one year was not enough for them.</p><p>I have seen one person failing ten times in his matriculation
examination. You will ask what happened the eleventh time? -- he did not
appear in the examination. Enough is enough! He was the most experienced
matriculate, although he never passed in ten years continuously. People
who had been colleagues with him became his teachers and he was still
there -- ready, stable and permanent.</p><p>Each individual should be given credit for his own intelligence.
There should not be any time limit, because that time limit wastes the
more talented, the more genuinely intelligent, the geniuses, and waits
for the retarded, for the idiotic and the stupid. It is an ugly
system.</p><p>Of course with genetic engineering the idiots and the stupid will not
be allowed to enter into life. Move somewhere else! -- there are fifty
thousand planets in the universe where life exists -- why bother us?
Move on, go somewhere else where people are still idiots and still
listen to the priests and go to the churches. This planet is no more for
you.</p><p>The classroom will have a totally different form. It will not be the
classroom where the teacher teaches you; although he knows more and you
know less, his knowledge is out of date. He has learned everything
thirty years ago, when he was a student. In thirty years everything has
changed. It is such an insane structure that people who are teaching in
the universities are all out of date.</p><p>What they are teaching is no more relevant.</p><p>According to me, the library can be the only classroom. The teacher
can only be a guide to help the students to find the latest, the
recentmost researches in every subject. In the library the students
should be there, and the teacher should be there just to help them,
because he is more acquainted with the library, he has been longer in
the library, he knows about the new discoveries and the latest
inventions which have arrived. His function should be that of a guide to
lead the students to the up to date knowledge.</p><p>This can be facilitated very easily with computers, with television
sets. In the twentieth century you need not teach people geography with
a map when television can bring you exactly to the place you are
learning about -- New York or London or Peking -- you need not bother
yourself looking at maps, looking at pictures, descriptions. On the
television screen you can be instantly in New York, and what is seen is
remembered more easily than what is heard, than what is read.</p><p>The future belongs to the televisions, to the computers, because they
are the memory systems. The teacher will have a totally new function
that will not be of teaching but only of guidance -- where you can find
the right book in the library, where you can find the right video in the
library, where you can find the right information in the computer.</p><p>Teaching becomes more alive, more colorful, more real. And the day is
not far away when television will be three-dimensional. Then it will
seem exactly as if people are walking and may come out of the television
set any moment. Only two three-dimensional films were made, then the
idea was dropped because they were too costly. But they will come back.
With better techniques they will not be that costly.</p><p>I have seen one of the films. It was a strange experience. A man
throws a spear -- and the whole audience in the movie hall gives way,
because it is as if that spear is going through the hall. It is
three-dimensional; it is as realistic as any actual spear can be. A man
comes running on his horse and people shriek and divide to give way to
the horse... it is just entering into the hall. It never enters! Slowly
they become accustomed, by the end of the film: "Don't be worried. Just
sit tight in your seat. Nothing is coming out of the screen. It comes
only up to the screen and stops."</p><p>When things can be taught in three-dimensional televisions and films,
when everything that you need to memorize can be done by a small
computer... It can be connected with the national computer, which
carries all the knowledge that has been found since man started coming
down from the trees. You can get every information, information which
will be very difficult to remember.</p><p>For example, if I ask you -- and you are all educated people here --
"On what day was Socrates married?"... Now, how educated are you? You
cannot remember the date Socrates was married; it was such a great date
that he suffered his whole life, and you don't even have compassion
enough to remember the date! But your computer can remember all that you
want. It can contain whole libraries immediately at hand.</p><p>The future of education, if scientifically worked out, is going to be
a tremendous adventure. Up to now it has been a kind of enforcement;
students have to be forced, bribed.</p><p>Education can become so colorful, so actual, so real that you will
not need to say to the students, "Be attentive!" They will be attentive
automatically.</p><p>And the same for the second part of education. All scientific
technology can be used to give you experiences very close to death. You
can be taught meditations, you can be taught relaxation, you can be
taught how to go deeper in your sleep. Hypnotism will play a great role
in the second part of education, because you can be hypnotized so deeply
that you can almost touch the territory of death.</p><p>Hypnotism became condemned by the same people who are always
condemning everything that can make man's life more easy, more pleasant,
more juicy. The organized religions have been such poisoners. They
condemned hypnotism, which is a science in itself and has to be revived
again. It is the only way to take you to the whole area that you will
pass through when you die.</p><p>If you have passed that area many times death will not be anything to
be feared. On the contrary, you will be tremendously excited. You have
lived, you have lived so fully, you are contented with life; you would
love to know what death is... a new challenge, a new beginning, entering
into the universal, getting out of the imprisonment of the body,
becoming just pure consciousness.</p><p>Unless education can teach you both life and death it is not complete
education. Unless education can make everybody dignified,
self-respectful, neither inferior</p><p>to anybody nor superior to anybody, it is not education. So I begin
with genetic engineering.</p><p>I end up with meditation, enlightenment.</p><p>Before death you must realize what tremendous beauty and splendor is
contained within your consciousness. Then education covers your whole
life, and gives you the most perfect possibility of your growth.</p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>THESE DAYS I FEEL LIKE A FRUITCAKE. ALSO I'M READING THE IDIOT BY</p><p>FYODOR DOSTOEVSKY. DO YOU THINK THERE IS ANY CONNECTION?</p><p>Vimal, there is nothing wrong in feeling like a fruitcake. It is
really delicious. It is so nice... and it cannot have any connection
with the reading of the great masterpiece of Fyodor Dostoevsky, THE
IDIOT. THE IDIOT is only the name, but the person he calls the idiot in
that great novel... That novel has to be considered one of the ten great
novels in the whole world literature. There is no way to think that
anything better than Fyodor Dostoevsky's IDIOT can be created.</p><p>The idiot is a sage. He is called idiot by the people because they
can't understand his simplicity, his humbleness, his purity, his trust,
his love. You can cheat him, you can deceive him, and he will still
trust you. That's why people think he is an idiot. He is really one of
the most beautiful characters ever created by any novelist.</p><p>The novel could just as well have been called THE SAGE. His trust is
so much that it does not matter that you deceive. It does not matter
that you cheat him; that is your problem, it is not his problem. His
love, his trust will continue. Dostoevsky's idiot is not an idiot; he is
one of the sanest men amongst an insane humanity.</p><p>But this is the problem: if you are living in a society where
everybody is blind and only you have eyes, you will be in constant
difficulty. Those blind people will not believe that you have eyes;
those blind people would like to destroy your eyes, because your eyes
are giving them constant anxiety and tension. But somebody has something
which nobody else has... so most probably they will destroy your
eyes.</p><p>In an insane world, to be sane is the most difficult situation. If
you can become the idiot of Fyodor Dostoevsky, it is perfectly
beautiful; it is really a fruitcake! There is no harm in it. It is
better than to be a cunning politician, better than to be a cunning
priest.</p><p>Humbleness has such a blessing. Simplicity has such a
benediction.</p><p>Solomon Fiegenbaum came home one evening and was startled to find a
young girl ransacking his apartment. Looking at her sternly, he said,
"Young woman, you are a thief! I am going to call the police."</p><p>"Please, sir," she pleaded, "if I get in trouble again, I will be put
away for years. Please don't call the police."</p><p>"I'm very sorry, but I have to," replied Sollie.</p><p>"Please, sir," she begged him tearfully, "I will do anything for you.
I will even give you my body."</p><p>Sollie thought for a moment. "Okay," he said, "take off your clothes
and get into my bed."</p><p>The girl did so and Sollie quickly followed. He tried and tried and
tried for about half an hour. Exhausted, he finally gave up.</p><p>"It's no use," Sollie cried, "I just can't make it. I will have to
call the police." Such cunning people... but the world is full of them.
Be simple like a small child</p><p>-- that is the idea of Dostoevsky in THE IDIOT.</p><p>Elmer, aged nine, was puzzled over the girl problem and discussed it
with his</p><p>friend, Ernie.</p><p>"I've walked her to school three times," said Elmer, "and carried her
books, and I have bought her an ice cream twice. Now, do you think I
ought to kiss her?"</p><p>"No, you don't need to," said Ernie. "You have already done enough
for that girl."</p><p>Children have a beauty, and they have an insight which, as you grow
old, you lose.</p><p>The village priest approached a group of small boys sitting in a

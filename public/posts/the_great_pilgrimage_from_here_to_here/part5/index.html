IT SEEMS SO FAMILIAR, YET FROM A LONG\nTIME AGO. IN THESE MOMENTS THERE FEELS NO GAP OF YOU AND ME. I AM LIKE A CHILD PLAYING IN YOUR BEAUTIFUL GARDEN.\nBELOVED OSHO, IS THIS SIGNIFICANT OR AM I ALREADY MOVING INTO MY\nSECOND CHILDHOOD AT THE RIPE OLD AGE OF THIRTY-FIVE?\nP.S. YOU CAN SCARE ME ANY TIME.\nPrem Yatra, this great experiment through which you all are passing is basically to achieve your lost childhood again.\nWhen I say \"your lost childhood,\" I mean your innocence, your eyes full of wonder, knowing nothing, having nothing, but yet feeling yourself at the top of the world. Those golden moments of wonder, joy, no tension, no worry, no anxiety, have to be regained, rediscovered. The sage is nothing but the circle that started in your birth coming full way, complete, back to the same point.\nOf course the second childhood is far more valuable and significant than the first. In the first the innocence was there because of ignorance, so it was not pure and clear and in your possession; it was just a natural thing that happens to every childhood. The second childhood is your greatest achievement -- it does not happen to all. The second childhood makes you innocent without ignorance, the second childhood comes through all kinds of experiences. It is mature, centered, ripe.\nYou should be blessed that you are feeling like that. The second childhood is just exactly the existential meaning of meditation, and from there on is the great pilgrimage of coming back home -- which you have never really left, which is impossible to leave, because it is you. Wherever you will go, you will find yourself there.\nIt is not even a shadow which follows you because that will disappear if you are sitting in the shade. It will appear only when you are standing in the sunlight. Your shadow is not an eternal companion, and in times of darkness even your shadow itself leaves you. But in the times of light your shadow is back.\nThe same is the situation with friends, lovers: in the days of darkness they leave you just like the shadow; in the days of success, richness, they all come back. They are not really companions.\nThere is only one essential being in you which will be everywhere with you,\nwithout any condition. Even if you are in hell it doesn't matter, it will be with you; if you are in heaven it doesn't matter, it will be with you.\nTo find that essential core of your being is on the one hand utter innocence, and on the other hand is the greatest wisdom that has ever existed on the earth.\nSo your body may be becoming old, but if you are learning ways of being silent and peaceful and meditative and loving, you will not grow old. You will remain as young and as fresh as early morning dewdrops shining in the beautiful sunrise, looking far more precious than any pearls.\nYou should be happy and rejoice in your childhood. This is what Jesus meant when he said again and again, \"Unless you are born again...\" Even Christians have not got the meaning of his statement. They think literally that \"unless you are born again\" means that first you will have to die, and then you will be born, and on the judgment day Jesus will take you into paradise. That is not the meaning of the man.\nWhat he is saying is: Unless you die right now as a personality and emerge as an innocent individuality, unscratched, unpolluted by the society and the people... This is your new birth, this is resurrection.\nEnjoy your divine childhood, and when it is the right time I will scare you! You are too new; the childhood is not yet absolutely settled, and you can misunderstand if I scare you.\nJust wait...! That moment will also come. Right now your whole concern should be getting deeper into childhood.\nI don't scare anybody except Avirbhava, because she has a quality of a child. I don't know why. Perhaps her father is dead, her mother is dead... I feel a tremendous feeling for her -\n- and she is utterly innocent. So once in a while -- not once in a while, almost every day --\nwhenever I have the chance and she is close by, I try to do my best.\n\"I don't want your son, Ernie, swimming in our pool anymore\" says Mrs. Meyer to her neighbor, Mrs. Jones.\n\"But what has my poor little Ernie done?\" asks Mrs. Jones. \"He is constantly peeing in the pool,\" says Mrs. Meyer angrily.\n\"Don't be so hard on him,\" says Mrs. Jones, \"all children of his age do that!\" \"Maybe they do,\" says Mrs. Meyer, \"but not from the diving board.\"\nChildhood has its beauties, because it does not know the etiquette, the manners, and all kinds of crap. It is so simple and so innocent and so spontaneous.\nA man walked into a bar and was amazed to see a dog sitting at a table with three men playing poker. The man went over and asked, \"Can that dog really read his cards?\"\n\"Sure he can,\" said one of the men. \"But he's not much of a player. Whenever he draws a good hand he wags his tail!\"\nThat is absolutely innocent... the poor dog cannot contain his joy.\nTwo cockroaches were munching delicacies on top of a garbage pile when one of them began telling of some new tenants in the nearby apartments.\n\"I hear,\" he said, \"that their refrigerator is spotless, their floors are gleaming, and there is not a speck of dust in the whole place.\"\n\"Please, please,\" said the other cockroach, \"not while I'm eating!\" Such bad news...!\nIt will be a tremendous revolution the day we start learning the languages of birds, of bees, of cockroaches. They all have their ways of communicating. But then the heart feels a little sadness, because we have not been able to learn even to communicate with human beings, and we have been here for millions of years. What kind of stupidity is this, that we don't know the whole humanity as belonging to us and we belonging to it? All that man has done is simply butchering, murdering, war. The same energy, the same effort would have made this world the greatest miracle in the whole universe.\nBut we don't understand each other. We may even be speaking the same\nlanguage, but understanding is not necessarily expected; what is expected is misunderstanding. So people are hiding themselves, hiding their childhood, hiding their innocence, protecting themselves from everybody with defense measures; otherwise you will see children young and old all playing in this garden of the earth, rejoicing, laughing, giggling. Why this seriousness? Man has not gained anything out of this seriousness; he has simply lost everything -- but he continues to be serious.\nI am absolutely against seriousness. I call it a psychological sickness.\nOnly a playful, childlike, innocent behavior is the right behavior, is what I would like to call virtuous behavior, religious, spiritual... not only human but divine.\nThe moment you are as innocent as a child you have transcended humanity, you have entered into the world of godliness.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nI LOVE THE WORDS YOU USE, \"ONE'S ORIGINAL FACE,\" BUT I HAVE NO\nEXISTENTIAL GLIMPSE OR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT YOU MEAN BY\nTHEM. WOULD YOU CARE TO EXPLAIN FURTHER?\nVeena, the original face is only a poetic expression for your absolute innocence, which is not damaged by your parents, by your teachers, by your society, by your culture and by yourself.\nI can understand why you love those words... because you don't have the original face.\nAnd the reason you don't have the original face is... You are trying hard for it, but whenever I look at you there is a certain pretension, a certain hypocrisy. There is no bad intention in your being, but you want to look the way you should\nlook, and that is destroying the whole thing. You should look the way you are.\nDrop all nonsense that has been imposed on you with all those commandments that religions have been issuing, without any respect to the uniqueness of individuals.\nJust be yourself.\nThat's the meaning of the original face.\nIt is just a poetic expression to say to you: Don't try in any way to look more beautiful, to look more meditative, to look more respectful. Those are deadly poisons... the very desire to look like somebody who you are not.\nMy whole teaching is: Just be what you are and don't care a bit about the world. Then you will feel a tremendous relaxation and a deep peace within your heart. That is your original face, relaxed, without tensions, without pretensions, without hypocrisies, without the so-called disciplines of how you should behave.\nBut all those poisons have gone deep in your blood, in your bones, in your marrow. What I am trying to do is to take out those poisons and give you back your naturalness. And there is nothing more beautiful than the natural, there is nothing more mysterious than the original; no etiquette, no mannerism can improve upon it.\nBut everybody is trying to improve upon himself. Then everything becomes false. Your smile is false, your hands raised together folded in reverence are just an exercise of the hands -- your heart is not with them. And unfortunately I have such eyes that I can see exactly where the trouble is; when everybody is laughing there are serious and sober people who are pretending to hold their laughter, because it doesn't look right.\nVeena, you have been a long, long time with me, but I have never felt that you are relaxed, at ease, at home. Just being at ease, relaxed, at home, all these poor trees know what is the original face, these birds know what is the original face. Only man has forgotten, because he has found masks upon masks; he is lost in the jungle of masks, and now it is very difficult to find which is the original.\nBut a simple understanding... whenever you see yourself tense, remember that you are doing something against nature. Whenever you are doing something more special than others, remember that you are trying to be superior, behaving as a great meditator, behaving as a real English lady. English ladies don't have original faces!\nDrop all this nonsense of being English and German and Indian. I see Indians here once in a while, and even in the tumultuous laughter of you all I can detect them; either they will laugh louder than anybody to show that they are not the Indians I condemn, or they will just look downwards to hide their face, because they have lost the intelligence to understand even a simple joke. And rather than enjoying the moment, they are judging continuously whether it is right to tell a joke in a religious discourse.… Who told you this is a religious discourse? I hate the very word! I just enjoy to be with you.\nThis very enjoyment is our religiousness.\nWe don't have anything except ourselves. And condemned by the whole world, which is a big world, still we have our simplicity, our innocence; we have got rid of all old garbage. Just allow yourself to come out of the cage that you yourself have been creating... and others have been helping.\nThe original face is a beautiful poetic expression, but it does not mean that you will have a different face. This same face will lose all its tensions, this same face will be relaxed, this same face will be nonjudgmental, this same face will not think of others as inferior.\nThis same face under these new values will be your original face.\nThere is an ancient proverb: Many a hero is a man who did not have the courage to be a coward. If you are a coward what is wrong in it? You are a coward -- it is perfectly good.\nCowards are also needed, otherwise from where will you get heroes? They are an absolute necessity to give the background to create heroes.\nJust be yourself, whatever it is. The problem is that never before has anybody told you just to be yourself. Everybody is poking his nose in, saying that you should be this way, you should be that way -- even in ordinary matters.\nIn my school... I was just a small boy, but I hated to be told how I have to be. Teachers started bribing me -- \"If you behave rightly, you can become a genius.\"\nI said, \"Hell with the genius -- I simply want to be myself.\"\nI used to sit with my legs on the table, and every teacher was offended. They would say,\n\"What kind of behavior is this?\"\nI said, \"The table is not saying anything to me. It is something between me and the table, so why are you looking so angry? I am not putting my legs on your head! You should relax just as I am relaxing. And this way I feel better able to understand what nonsense you are teaching.\"\nJust beside the room was a beautiful window, and outside were trees and birds and cuckoos. Mostly I was looking out of the window, and the teacher would come and say,\n\"Why do you come to school at all?\"\nI said, \"Because in my house there is no window like this which opens up to the whole sky, and around my house there are no cuckoos, no birds. The house is in the city, surrounded by other houses, so crowded that birds don't come there, cuckoos don't feel that these are the people to be blessed by their songs.\n\"Forget the idea that I come here to listen to you! I am paying my fee, you are simply a servant and you should remember that. If I fail I will not come to complain to you; if I fail I will not feel sad. But if for the whole year I have to pretend that I am listening to you, and I am listening to the cuckoos outside, that will be the beginning of a hypocritical life. And I don't want to be a hypocrite.\"\nOn every matter the teachers, the professors wanted you to do it in a certain way. In my school in those days, and perhaps even today, using a cap was necessary. I have nothing against caps; since I have left the university I have started using caps, but I never wore one until I left the university. The first teacher who was worried about me, said, \"You are disturbing the discipline of the school. Where is your cap?\"\nI said, \"Bring the school code of behavior. Is there any mention that every boy\nshould use a cap? And if there is not, you are imposing something against the school code.\"\nHe took me to the principal of the school and I told the principal, \"I am absolutely ready, just show me where it is written that a cap is compulsory. If it is compulsory, I may even leave the school, but first let me see where it is written.\"\nThere was no written code and I said, \"Can you give me any other reasonable arguments for using the cap? Will it increase my intelligence? Will it increase my life? Will it give me better health, more understanding?\" I said, \"As far as I know, Bengal is the only province in India where caps are not used, and that is the most intelligent part of the country. Punjab is just the opposite. There for a cap, people use turbans -- such big turbans, as if their intelligence is escaping so they are keeping it. And that is the most unintelligent part of the country.\"\nThe principal said, \"There seems to be some sense in what you are saying, but it is a school discipline. If you stop using caps, then others will stop.\"\nI said, \"Then what is the fear? Just drop the whole old convention.\"\nNobody wants to allow you to be yourself on matters which are absolutely insignificant.\nI used to have long hair in my childhood. And I used to come in and out of my father's shop, because the shop and the home were connected. The home was behind the shop and it was absolutely necessary to pass through the shop. People would ask, \"Whose girl is this?\" -- because my hair was so long, they could not think that a boy should be having such long hair.\nMy father felt very ashamed and embarrassed to say, \"He is a boy.\" But they said, \"Then why all this hair?\"\nOne day -- it was not his normal nature -- he became so embarrassed and angry that he came and cut my hair with his own hands. Bringing the scissors with which he used to cut cloth in his shop, he cut my hair. I didn't say anything to him -- he was surprised. He said,\n\"You don't have anything to say?\"\nI said, \"I will say it in my own way.\" \"So what do you mean?\"\nI said, \"You will see.\" And I went to the opium-addict barber who used to have a shop just in front of our house. He was the only man I had a respect for. There were a row of barber shops, but I loved that old man. He was a rare variety, and he loved me; for hours we used to talk to each other. What he was saying was all nonsense! One day he was saying to me, \"If all the opium addicts can be organized into a political party, we can take over this country!\"\nI said, \"It is a good idea.\"\nBut he said, \"Because we are all opium addicts, I myself forget my own idea.\"\nI said, \"You don't be worried. I am here and I will remember. You just tell me what changes you want to have in the country, what kind of political ideology you want, and I will manage it.\"\nHe said, \"That's good.\"\nSo I went to him and I told him, \"Just shave my whole head completely.\" In India the head is shaved completely only when your father dies.\nFor a moment even that opium addict came to his senses. He said, \"What has happened?\nHas your father died?\"\nI said, \"Don't bother about these things. You do what I am saying; it is none of your concern! You just cut my hair completely, shave it completely.\"\nHe said, \"Done! That is the easiest job. So many times I get into trouble. People say to me, `Shave the beard,' and I forget and I shave their heads. They say,\n`What have you done?' And I say, Àt the most I can say to you don't pay for it -- what is the problem?'\"\nI used to sit in his shop, because there was always something so ridiculous happening. He would cut half the mustache of somebody and would say, \"Wait, I have remembered some urgent work.\" And the man would say, \"But I am caught\nhere in your chair and half the mustache is gone. I cannot go out of the shop!\" He would say, \"Simply wait there.\"\nAnd then hours will pass and that man is sitting there...\"What kind of idiot is this man?\"\nAt one time I had to help by cutting the half mustache of a man. I said, \"Now you are free. Just never come back here again... because that man has not done much harm to you, he just forgets.\"\nSo the barber said, \"That's right. It is none of my concern. If he has died, he has died.\"\nHe shaved my head completely, and I went home. I passed through the shop. My father looked and all his customers looked. They said, \"What happened? Whose boy is this? His father has died.\"\nMy father said, \"He is my boy and I am alive! But I knew he was going to do something.\nHe has answered me well.\"\nWherever I went people would ask, \"What happened? He was perfectly healthy.\"\nI said, \"People die at any age. You are worried about him, you are not worried about my hairs.\"\nThat was the last thing my father ever did to me, because he knew that the answer could be more dangerous! On the contrary, he brought a certain oil that is used for growing hair. It is a very costly oil, comes from Bengal out of a certain flower, javakusum. It is very costly, rare, used only by the richest people -- and not by men but by women -- to keep the hair as long as possible. In Bengal I have come across women whose hair touched the earth -- five feet long, six feet long. That oil simply functions powerfully on the hairs.\nI said, \"Now you understand.\"\nHe said, \"I have understood. You use this oil quickly; in a few months your hair will be back.\"\nI said, \"You created the whole mess. What was there to be embarrassed about? You could have said, `She is my girl.' I don't have any objection about that. But you should not have interfered with me the way you did. It was violent, barbarous. Rather than saying anything to me, you simply started cutting my hair.\"\nNobody allows anybody to be just himself. And you have learned all those ideas so deeply that it seems they are your ideas. Just relax. Forget all those conditionings, drop them like dry leaves falling from the trees. It is better to be a naked tree without any leaves than to have plastic leaves and plastic foliage and plastic flowers; that is ugly.\nThe original face simply means that you are not being dominated by any kind of morality, religion, society, parents, teachers, priests, not being dominated by anyone. Just living your life according to your own inner sense -- you have a sensibility -- and you will have the original face.\nThe young teacher wrote on the blackboard, \"I ain't had no fun all summer.\" Then she asked the children, \"What is wrong with that sentence and what do I do to correct it?\"\nLittle Ernie shouted from the back, \"Get a boyfriend.\"\nThe sentence will be corrected by itself -- just get a boyfriend!\nThis is the simple original face; it doesn't bother about consequences. But England is perhaps the most attached to false personalities.…\nElizabeth and Philip had been married for a considerable time, and it became particularly apparent to Philip that Elizabeth had lost all enthusiasm for their lovemaking.\nOn a recent occasion, Philip was making love to his wife when he suddenly said, \"Is something the matter? Are you hurt?\"\n\"No, I'm all right,\" answered Elizabeth. \"Why do you ask?\" \"Oh,\" said Philip, \"for a moment there, I thought you moved.\"\nPeople have become absolutely dead. And Veena comes from that same lot of\nlunatics!\nJust enjoy and be at ease with yourself and with the world, and the original face starts shining by itself.\nWhen the doctor had finished his examination of the woman, he looked up and said brightly, \"Mrs. Brown, I have good news for you.\"\n\"I'm glad of that, doctor,\" said the woman, \"But I am MISS Brown.\"\n\"Miss Brown,\" said the doctor, without changing expression, \"I have bad news for you.\"\nThere are many people whose expressions will not change. Now such a great change --\nfrom Mrs. Brown to Miss Brown -- but the doctor is keeping his personality, his face, absolutely without change.\nWhenever I look at Veena I feel very sad for her... no expression, sits just like a marble statue. She is beautiful. She will make a good model if you want to make a marble statue.\nBut it seems she is holding back from life; she is not allowing the playfulness and the joy that are our birthright. That is why the words òriginal face' strike her. It looks immensely intriguing -- but she cannot understand what it means. It does not mean another face; it simply means no face imposed upon that which you have got from nature itself.\nOne needs a little courage, a little daring, just to be himself whatever the circumstances.\nAnd on the whole, every circumstance and every consequence -- even if you have to suffer -- will enrich your individuality, will make your intelligence sharper, will give you a sense of direction which comes from your own inner being and is not given by some guide from outside.\nQuestion 3 BELOVED MASTER,\nEVERY TIME I MANAGE TO CLUTCH A STRAW YOU STEP ON MY FINGERS.\nMY BRAIN IS TOTALLY SCRAMBLED. MY WHOLE WORLD SEEMS UNREAL.\nYOU GOT ME INTO THIS MESS -- ARE YOU GOING TO GET ME OUT, OR IS\nTHAT UP TO ME?\nPrem Nayana, the first thing is: I am going to get you into a deeper mess, because unless you touch the rock bottom of your mess, it is very difficult to get out of it.\nDo you know how to swim? Have you ever drowned in a river? -- and what happens?\nYou have to go first to the bottom and then at the bottom you are thrown up. That is why dead people know the secret but the living people don't. You will not see any dead person drowning -- he simply floats, and living people get drowned. They say they don't know swimming, but dead people are swimming perfectly well!\nSo as far as I am concerned I am not going to get you out of the mess. I will manage every way to take you to the rock bottom, then you will pop up on your own.\nAnd what do you mean, \"Every time I manage to clutch a straw you step on my fingers\"?\nJust don't clutch at any straw. It is so easy...! And you know me perfectly well. I will not let you clutch at any straw, because those straws are not going to save you; I will step on your fingers. You cannot make me stop, but you can do one thing: stop clutching at straws.\nShe is speaking in a very poetic way. To translate it into pragmatic language, she is saying that whenever she starts believing in some principle, I demolish it. Whenever she starts creating a system of beliefs and finds a consolation in that belief system, I destroy it.\nMy way of creating goes through a long passage of destroying, because the real work is to destroy -- and then you will come out of it. You don't have to be created. You are there already, dumped with so much garbage that I have to take that garbage away. And you are clutching...!\nNever try to make a system of beliefs out of what I am saying. If you understand me well, I am not a system maker and I don't want believers, I don't want followers. I don't want anybody to think that I am the savior.\nI don't even shave my own beard! Nirvano goes on saying to me, \"I can trim it a little.\"\nI say, \"No, absolutely no! These are my original hairs. I have never shaved my beard.\nThey are the same original hairs as when they first had started growing in my youth, and I am going to keep them to the very last.\"\nShe feels worried that they will become thinner, that this beard will become too long. I said, \"Don't be worried. Even if it starts touching the ground, I am always in favor of the original.\"\nOne very essential thing which I have been telling you, but I have to repeat it, is: Feel me more than my words, feel my presence more than my presentation. I am not a philosopher. I am incurably a mystic. There is no medicine which can cure me.\nBut if you go on... and this has happened with thousands of people; in these thirty years I must have come across millions of people, but they were all seeking some savior -- and I walked on their fingers. They were all seeking somebody to take away their responsibility, without knowing that the moment your responsibility is gone, your freedom is also gone. They exist together; they are inseparable.\nIf you want freedom, you have to accept every responsibility. If you want freedom, you don't have to clutch with your hands onto any belief, philosophy, religion. You just be yourself. Why can't you enjoy yourself consciously? There is no intrinsic necessity for having a belief.\nThousands of people have come to me and gone. There was a time I was\nsurrounded by Jainas. Unfortunately I was born in a Jaina family, so naturally my first audience was of Jainas. They were immensely happy because I was saying things which they had never thought about, I was interpreting their scriptures in a totally new way. They had great hope in me. They thought that...\nTheir religion has remained very small; it is the smallest religion in India. And it is the ancientmost religion -- it is more ancient than Hinduism. But what calamity has happened? Even today there are not more than thirty-five lakhs of Jainas in a country of nine hundred million people. What has happened? Jainism is at least seven thousand years old -- that is at least. It can be more, older, because in Harrappur and in Mohanjodro two ancient cities have been excavated, and Jaina statues have been found in those cities.\nNow it is a scientific fact that those cities were destroyed somewhere between seven thousand and ten thousand years ago, and that is a very conservative estimate. But even if we take that estimate, in ten thousand years the population of the Jainas has remained negligible -- thirty-five lakhs. That is not worth any consideration! That is why in the great religions of the world Jainism is never counted -- never counted with Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism. They are great religions, and they are all very new as far as Jainism is concerned.\nBecause of my interpretations they had a tremendous hope in me, that perhaps I may spread their religion to the whole world, take the message to the whole world. But they were unaware -- they were my first audience -- they were not aware what kind of man I am: I cannot support anything which my heart is not ready to support.\nSo a few things I have supported in Jainism -- people were very happy. But the moment I started telling about things which I cannot support, they were shocked. I have walked on their fingers. Just a small thing -- which is so rational -- and the Jaina community... their supreme command decided to expel me. I wrote a letter to them saying, \"Don't be stupid.\nI expel you all from my life. You don't have to expel me; you cannot. I am no more part of you.\"\nAnd what was the reason? I addressed a Jaina conference and told them, \"You are the oldest vegetarians of the world. You eat the purest food, but you have not produced a single Nobel prize winner. What is your contribution to art, to music,\nto science, to mathematics, to painting, to poetry? What is your contribution to the world? There are the Jews who get forty percent of all the Nobel prizes, and the rest of the world has to live only on sixty percent.\"\nAnd I told them, \"The reason is -- I have deeply enquired into the matter -- that in vegetarian food something is missing which is necessary for intelligence. That is why you have remained retarded.\"\nVegetarian food is not complete, and particularly for intelligence certain vitamins are missing. Those vitamins can be found in meat. Certainly I cannot support non-vegetarian food. Even though it gives you better intelligence, it destroys your very soul; it makes you cruel, violent, inhuman.\nSo I suggested to them, \"I have found something which should be immediately accepted if any intelligence is left in you, and that is eating eggs which are not fertilized, non-fertilized eggs. They are not living, there is no life. If you leave them they will simply rot and disappear. There is no life in them because the male sperm has not entered into the mother's egg; the mother has grown the egg without the male sperm. It is not alive, so there is no harm in eating it. It is vegetarian.\"\nSuddenly they were very angry. I am suggesting for them to eat eggs, and they are afraid even to eat tomatoes, because tomatoes look like meat -- just the color, poor tomatoes...\nHow can they conceive of themselves eating non-fertilized eggs? Somebody stood up and said, \"Maybe that is right that they are not living, but they are coming from animals.\"\nI said, \"So is milk; what is the difference? If you are avoiding anything that is coming from any living being, your children are from the very beginning against Jainism; they are drinking their mother's milk. And you are drinking milk\" -- and Jainas drink milk and milk-made products more than anybody. They cannot enjoy meat and non-vegetarian foods, so to substitute they have invented thousands of ways of delicacies made of milk products.\nBut the very word ègg' was enough for them to leave me completely; the Jainas disappeared. I was dangerous! I was teaching something that they have never done in ten thousand years. No scripture of theirs suggests anything about it. But they were absolutely unable to answer my questions -- \"If you are eating the\npurest food, your intelligence should have been the purest flame, the sharpest genius, the most creative, but it has not been so.\" And immediately -- they had come to me because they thought I was supporting their system, but I am not supporting anybody's system -- they disappeared.\nThen the second gang was of Gandhians. For a little while it was okay, but the moment I criticized Mahatma Gandhi... nobody had any answer for it, but the Gandhians disappeared. I had stepped on their fingers! And as the Gandhians disappeared, immediately socialists, communists gathered around me, not knowing that the same is going to be their fate.\nOf course, from each group a few courageous people have remained. A few Jains have remained, a few Gandhians have remained, who had the intelligence to understand that I am not against anybody, but I cannot support anything which is fundamentally wrong, and is harmful to human life.\nThe communists were very happy, because they were in search of a man... The only calamity for the communists in India is that they don't have a saintly figure. They don't attract the masses, and the masses will never be attracted to communists, because they cannot think that someone who is speaking to them and also smoking a cigarette and putting it in the ashtray in between can be a leader. This is impossible for the Indian masses. And because communists don't believe in God, are against all religions, Indians cannot have any communion with them.\nYou will be surprised that in the Russian revolution there was one Indian as important as Lenin himself. His name was Edmund Roy; he was an international figure in the communist movement. Thinking that he was so much respected internationally by the communists, he came to India, back to his home, and here he came in conflict with Mahatma Gandhi immediately. He was right on many more points than Mahatma Gandhi, but that is not how the masses decide. He smoked cigarettes, he drank vodka, he has lived in Russia, he believed in violence: he is intolerable!\nSo when the communists saw that the Gandhians were angry with me, they thought it was an opportunity. If I can be their representative, it will be an immense help for them to gain power in India, because they have heard that I don't believe in any religions; they have heard there is no God, no heaven, no hell. They felt, \"This seems to be perfectly agreeing with us.\"\nIn fact, my emphasis was far deeper than their own philosophy. So when I said that there are no religions, but there is something higher than religion and that is religiousness; there is no God as a person, but as a presence, and the whole universe is full of godliness... I walked on their fingers! Immediately all communists disappeared from my audience. But a few courageous souls have remained, and have become accustomed to my stepping on their fingers. And they have learned one secret: With me it is not ideas that matter.\nWith me it is your transformation that matters.\nAnd your transformation is possible only if your mind slowly, slowly becomes calm and quiet.\nSo now I have my own people. But once in a while a stranger accidentally gets caught.\nNow I have been enquiring about that sannyasin Piyoosh, whether he has reached Igatpuri and Goenka or not; otherwise he should be loaded in a truck and sent to Igatpuri.\nThis is not his place. But he is hiding. He has not approached the office. He has not approached Swami Dhyan Yogi, who initiates sannyasins, to return his papers. So once in a while somebody who does not understand my way of working, gets into unnecessary trouble.\nI am not interested in how many people are meditating; it is not my responsibility. I am fulfilled and absolutely content. If death comes this moment I will not even tell death,\n\"Wait a few minutes more; let me finish my speech.\" What is the point? I am always ready; in the middle of the sentence I can stop. I have no desires, no longings, no stupid superiority complex of being a prophet or a messiah or a messenger of God. That is why I can speak to you now heart to heart.\nWhen I call you my people, it simply means you are no longer Hindus, no longer Christians, no longer Jews, that you have dropped all that rubbish away, that you have come to me as an individual on your own authority. And I will not give you new chains to console you.\nYou are saying to me, \"You got me into this mess.\" You are wrong, Prem\nNayana, you got into this mess on your own accord. I never go and knock on people's doors -- but it is so easy to throw away the responsibility, without knowing you are throwing away your freedom too. I cannot accept the responsibility because I cannot destroy your freedom. I love you too much.\nAnd now you are saying, \"You got me into this mess -- are you going to get me out, or is it up to me?\" It has been always up to you whether to get into the mess or get out of it. It is none of my business. I have never bothered.… Millions of people have passed by my side, people who were ready to die for me, or were ready to kill me just if I said something that went against their prejudices -- the same people.\nIt has been a tremendously rich life of experiences, but now I am absolutely finished with taking anybody's responsibility, destroying anybody's freedom. You are here on your own accord. Whatever happens to you, you are responsible; it is happening out of your freedom. I respect your freedom so much that I cannot take the responsibility.\nJust meditate over the whole matter, and you will see this is not a place where one gets into a mess; this is a place where we dry-clean you! All the mess that you bring with you, we take it away... slowly, so it does not hurt you too much. But one has to be very alert and very intelligent if he wants to remain with me. I am not here for retarded idiots.\nThe worried wife came to the doctor and said, \"Doctor, I don't know what is wrong with my husband. He has sudden changes. Monday he liked milk- pudding, Tuesday he liked milk-pudding, Wednesday he liked milk-pudding, Thursday he liked milk-pudding, and all of a sudden, today he does not like milk-pudding.\"\nThis is not the place for such idiots, who can't understand simple things.\nMoishe Finkelstein met his old friend Sam Feigenbaum on the street in Moscow. \"Did you hear,\" said Moishe, \"that old Yossel Mosovith has died?\"\n\"No,\" said Sam, \"I did not even hear that he had been arrested.\"\nA man was having his fiftieth birthday and his wife wanted to give him something really special. They had been married for twenty-five years and had\nthe perfect marriage.\n\"What's something you have never had on your birthday?\" she asked. He looked coy and she said, \"Come on, it is okay -- anything you want.\" \"Well,\" he said, \"I have never had a whore.\"\n\"Okay,\" she said, \"I will get you the best.\"\nSo she booked him a very classy whore for the whole night. When he came home the next day she asked, \"Did you enjoy yourself?\"\n\"Yes,\" he said shyly.\n\"Well, did she do anything I don't do?\" \"Yes,\" he said modestly.\n\"Well, what was it?\" she said. \"She moaned,\" said the husband.\nSo the next time they were making love, the wife kept saying, \"Shall I moan yet?\"\n\"Not yet,\" he would say.\nThen finally he was about to climax and he said, \"Okay start moaning, start moaning!\"\nSo the wife said, \"Oh my God! I have had a terrible day, your mother came, the vacuum cleaner broke, my hair is a mess \"\nPrem Nayana, this is a place of laughter and love, of joy and celebration. According to me it is the only holy place in the world. Just be careful not to clutch any straw, because then I cannot resist the temptation of stepping on your fingers. The responsibility is yours.\nOkay, Vimal?\nYes, Osho.\nThe Great Pilgrimage: From Here to Here Chapter #17\nChapter title: On the master's operating table\n14 September 1987 pm in Gautam the Buddha Auditorium Archive\ncode:\n8709145\nShortTitle:\nPILGR17\nAudio:\nYes Video:\nYes Length:\n83\nmins Question 1\nBELOVED OSHO,\nTHE OTHER DAY WHEN YOU SAID THAT I WAS \"COMING ALONG FINE, SLOW BUT STEADY.\" FOR ME, IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL STATEMENT. BUT IT\nTOUCHED AN OLD WOUND THAT I WAS HARDLY AWARE OF.\nTHE WOUND COMES FROM SCHOOL AND BEING OFTEN TOLD THAT I WAS\nSLOW, A BIT DIM, NOT VERY INTELLIGENT AND DEFINITELY NEEDED TO\nTRY HARDER.\nAND LISTENING TO YOU I HAD THE FEELING THAT MAYBE ALL THIS WAS\nTRUE. IS IT?\nVimal, it is of great understanding on your part that you have not blamed me because I have touched your old wound. It hurts. But unless all the wounds are opened to the sun, to the wind, they will go on growing underneath; they can become cancerous.\nMany people, many more than the people who are suffering from physical cancer, are suffering from psychological cancer. And the only way to remove a psychological cancer is to expose it. If there is love and trust, then you will not start getting angry or hurt, because I am nothing but your physician. And just out of my love I have to hit you --\nsometimes very hard, because the crust that is covering your wound has become very thick.\nYour question reminded me of Veena. She had asked a question this morning. I had looked all around -- she was not here. Although I knew why she was not here, I have also enquired. And the reason she has given is that she woke up with a stiff neck. That need not prevent you from coming here. You have a stiff neck anyway! Then she has not turned up to work the whole day, and her boyfriend has been saying that she is very upset.\nFirst you ask a question, without ever thinking that you are putting me into a situation: either I have to lie just to console you, just to inflate your ego... but that way I am not your friend; that way I am your greatest enemy. That is what all the priests, all the religions, all your leaders have been doing for thousands of\nyears, and I don't want to do it. But I can see why they were doing it: you were very happy with them. They were giving you more and more doses of opium to keep you fast asleep and consoled.\nBecause I have to say the truth, it is bound to hurt you, sometimes very deeply. And I can understand; the pain that has been repressed suddenly uncoils within you. But if rather than bringing understanding it brings an upset, then it was better you had not asked the question. You cannot expect from me that I am going to nourish your ego, protect your wounds, console you in your misery, suffering, insincerity, helping you to be a beautiful hypocrite.\nShe is again not here; I have looked around.… And it is not that she is not hearing what I am saying; her room is just close by. She has heard in the morning -- the stiff neck came later on -- and she is hearing right now.\nBut you cannot understand my difficulty. If I don't care about you, then I can simply say things which console you but don't transform you. If I love you, then I have to be a surgeon and I have sometimes to operate on you.\nYou laugh so beautifully when you hear of Zen masters hitting their disciples, and if Veena goes on like this she will have unnecessarily forced me to carry a staff too. I have never carried anything in my hand in my whole life, but a friend has sent a beautiful staff, which is waiting. Either Veena gets okay by tomorrow morning, or I will have to use for the first time a very gross and primitive method.\nI hit you as sophisticatedly as possible, as playfully as possible. But if you are here not to be transformed, but are just hanging around unconsciously, not even aware why you are here, not being aware of the pilgrimage, then your being here or not being here is almost the same. One thing you should remember: by your being upset you cannot change me.\nYou can simply force me to use primitive methods that Zen masters used. Please don't force me! And the only way is that whenever I say to you... even if it hurts, my purpose is not to hurt you. When I hurt you it is almost a necessity.\nVimal has shown immense understanding. He is not complaining that I have touched his wound. That should be the attitude of everyone who has come to be part of this caravan, who has accepted a totally new way which has never existed before, and a totally new style of life, of utter freedom and love.\nBut you have to be reminded continuously that even love is not just simply a bed of roses.\nAnd the more you love me, the more I am going to be hard with you. The more you understand me, the more I can operate on you. You should remember that all my sannyasins are just on the operating table twenty-four hours a day. If you have a stiff neck, good; it will be operated on!\nVimal, whatever your teacher said to you is almost a universal problem. Teachers hurt their students, not out of love, not to help them, but to feel a certain power.\nThere is a very beautiful historical incident in the life of one of the great emperors of India. He had captured his own father, imprisoned him, because the father was living too long. And he could not wait anymore; he himself was getting old. By the time his father dies he will not be able to live longer himself to dominate the whole kingdom. The father has to be removed.\nPolitics knows nothing about love.\nThe father was imprisoned by his own son in jail. And strangely enough, the next day the father simply sent a message, \"There is no problem; I have ruled enough. You need not have taken so much trouble to arrest me. You could have simply said it to me. But now what has happened has happened. I would just like you to send thirty students, small boys, whom I can teach the holy KORAN\" -- their religious book.\nWhen the message reached the court of his son, who had now become the emperor of the whole of India... The son, despite being a ruthless, violent, ugly man, still seems to have had tremendous insight into the psychology of man -- and that is almost fifteen hundred years before Sigmund Freud.\nHe said to the court, \"Do you see this letter from my father? For what does he want these thirty children? He cannot live without dominating somebody, and the best way is to dominate small children because they are so helpless.\"\nAfter fifteen hundred years Sigmund Freud came to the same conclusion -- he had no idea of this incident -- that the people who teach in the schools, who choose the profession of teaching, somehow are people who don't have the courage to go into politics but still want to dominate. That is one thing to\nremember about teachers. In my vision not everybody should be allowed to be a teacher. It is one of the most fundamental things in life. Only people who have a meditative understanding and no desire to dominate should be allowed to be teachers. Then they will not hurt others, just to feel powerful themselves.\nI had graduated from the university, I had topped the whole university. I simply went directly to the education minister and I told him, \"I need to be appointed as a professor in a certain university.\"\nHe said, \"You are strange. You should have applied.\"\nI said, \"Applications cannot represent me. I have come myself.\" But he said, \"You need qualifications.\"\nI said, \"I have all the qualifications that you need, and I have much more.\" He said, \"What is much more?\"\nI said, \"Look into my eyes. I have no desire to dominate the way you have the desire to dominate. I am not a politician. And just because I don't have any desire to dominate, I am qualified to be a teacher.\"\nHe said, \"Strange argument. No application, no certificates, no moral certificates...\"\nI placed my certificates before him and I said, \"These are the certificates. But if you cannot see me, what will you be able to see in these certificates? And I am saying to you that I simply qualify on a ground which will be absolutely necessary in the future for every teacher.\"\nHe looked into my certificates and he said to me, \"Speak quietly! There are clerks and typists and other departments by the side.\"\nI said, \"I don't care about anybody. You just give me the appointment in the university I want; otherwise I am going to give a press conference and you will be unnecessarily embarrassed, because as far as educational qualifications are concerned they are amply fulfilled. What more do you want than a man who has topped the whole university? What more do you want than a man who has received as many marks as nobody else before?\nWhat do you want from a man who has this certificate from one of his examiners?\" It was just a letter written to me saying, \"For my whole life I have been waiting just to see something like the way you have answered the questions. In my whole life I have never given the first class award to anybody.\"\nHe was well known all over the country, particularly in this part, because I think he belonged to Poona or nearby, Professor Ranade. He was at that time the greatest professor of philosophy in India. In his letter he said, \"I wanted to give you one hundred percent marks, but I hesitated because people may think that I am somehow favoring you.\nSo please forgive me, I am giving you only ninety-nine percent. And the reason I am so impressed by your answers is that they are not from the textbooks. It seems you have never read your textbooks; it seems that you are the only person I have come across\" --\nand he was an old man, a retired professor -- \"who has responded to the questions spontaneously.\"\nI said to the education minister, \"What more do you want?\"\nHe became so afraid when I told him about the press conference that he immediately wrote the order. He said, \"It will reach.\"\nI said, \"I want it to be given to me to take with me when I go myself. What is the need to waste money in postage? You give it to me.\"\nAnd he became so freaked out! He said, \"You don't understand the bureaucratic way. It has to go through the post.\"\nI said, \"I don't want to support any bureaucracy. You give me the order, and you can send another copy of the order through your bureaucratic channel.\"\nJust out of fear he gave it to me with trembling hands. I laughed saying, \"It is strange.\nAre you taking my interview or am I taking your interview?\"\nAnd he was right. I reached before the order came through the mail, and when I gave the order to the vice-chancellor of the university he said, \"But I have not\nreceived anything.\"\nI said, \"This is the original. You will receive the true copy.\"\nHe said, \"This is just absolutely absurd. The original has to come to me.\" I said, \"It has come.\"\nHe became afraid that there may be some trouble later on for him. He immediately told me, \"I have to phone to the education minister.\"\nI said, \"You can phone.\"\nAnd he phoned. He said, \"This is a strange case, unprecedented. The order, the original order, has been brought by the person himself, and he says the true copy is coming through the bureaucracy -- whenever it comes it will come. What should I do?\"\nThe education minister said, \"Exactly what I have done! Simply do what he says; otherwise, from the very first day you will be creating trouble for yourself. So just do whatsoever he says. The true copy is coming by the bureaucracy.\"\nIt came after seven days.\nTeachers are psychologically attracted towards the profession for the simple desire of dominating, insulting, humiliating -- not out of love, not out of respect, not out of concern for your growth.\nSo it is good that you got your wound opened up. It has been created in your school, where they were telling you that you were \"slow, a bit dim, not very intelligent and definitely needed to try harder.\" Now you are saying, \"And listening to you I had the feeling that maybe all this was true. Is it?\"\nNo. Something of it was true and something of it was not true. I will have to separate the truth from the untruth.\nYou are not unintelligent, you are not dim; these statements are ugly from any teacher towards any student. These are the statements which make people dim and unintelligent, because repeated often in every class, again and again, they become a kind of hypnosis.\nThey start believing in them. And once a person starts believing that he is unintelligent, dim, he starts acting also in an unintelligent way, because he has to prove the idea that he has been given.\nBut as far as your being slow is concerned, they were absolutely right. You are slow, you are lazy. And your laziness is not bone lazy; otherwise I will forgive it. You are just lazy by habit. Bone lazy is someone who cannot help himself; from his very bones he is lazy.\nI am bone lazy, so I know perfectly well what bone lazy means. I have never done anything. How I have managed my life I sometimes wonder. People have been doing so much, and still they cannot manage their lives. It is just a miracle; I have simply not done anything.\nOne of my friends came from the Soviet Union to see me. He shook hands and he told me, \"You should never go to the Soviet Union.\"\nI said, \"Why?\"\nHe said, \"Your hands! Anybody shaking hands with you will immediately say that you don't belong to the proletariat, you are a capitalist, because you have never done anything\n-- no sign on your hands that you have even carried a bucket of water.\" And that's true!\nYou are in a far better position, Vimal. I cannot help it, so I have not tried at all; I have simply relaxed in my laziness. People have understood that if somebody is bone lazy and you love him, what to do? -- prepare food for him, prepare clothes for him, prepare his bed, prepare his bathroom, do everything.\nYou are just habitually lazy. You can drop it, you are more fortunate than me. But that does not mean that you have to work harder. You have just to understand that laziness is your habit, and to be enslaved by any habit is against your own growth. I am not interested that you should work more or less -- what does it matter? At least to me it matters nothing whether anybody works or not.\nThis much is certain: that if for fifty-seven years I could manage without moving from my bed, moving from my chair... that is the only movement I do. I am the only man who enjoys freedom of movement -- no obstacles, no problem.\nBut it will go against your own growth if you don't drop the habit. And you have such a beautiful soul that it will be a great misfortune not to attain to the ultimate illumination I have been talking about. Your laziness may become a hindrance; it is just against your own growth.\nSo you can think: if you want to remain the same, I have no objection; if you want to grow, then just see that your laziness is not something natural to you. You have learned it just by your teachers telling you that you are unintelligent, you are dim. You accepted their ideas -- and the natural effect of those ideas is laziness.\nYou are neither unintelligent nor dim. Drop that laziness which is hanging around like darkness. By dropping it you will find your intelligence becoming sharper, better, your understanding more clear, more deep, your love gaining new flowers and new foliage.\nA few sutras for you to contemplate, just lying down in your bed underneath the blanket, in utter laziness.\nA small town is one where there is no place to go that you should not. The only thing which cannot be misquoted is silence.\nNo matter what goes wrong, there is always somebody who knew it would. An optimist sees a doughnut -- a pessimist sees a hole.\nThe best way to succeed in the world is to find a crowd that is going somewhere and get in front of them.\nAfter man came woman, and she has been after him ever since. Opposites attract -- like sloe gin and fast women.\nYou don't get it? Neither do I! I will also think over it, because my understanding about gin or any other kind of alcoholic drugs is nil. I thought you may understand it!\nThere is a crack in everything God has made.\nPublic opinion exists only where there are no ideas.\nWhenever truth is injured, defend it. But if the truth goes against you, accept it. It is better to be defeated than to reject the truth.\nA start is like a love affair... any fool can start it, but to end it requires considerable skill.\nSo be alert! Before starting any love affair, be prepared how you will end it. That is called homework.\nAn Englishman thinks seated, a Frenchman standing, an American pacing, and an Irishman afterwards.\nTo keep an idea secret is to tell it to only one person at a time. Old age is when it is harder to find temptation than to resist it. Old men are not really old men, they are just twice boys.\nIf everything is coming your way, you are in the wrong lane.\nA fool and his money are soon elected. Drop the old proverb which used to say: A fool and his money are soon parted, that does not happen anymore. A fool and his money are soon elected.\nIf the facts are against you, argue the law. If the law is against you, argue the facts.\nIf the facts and the law are against you, shout like hell.\nIf worry makes you so nervous that your hand shakes, learn to play the guitar.\nThe reason there are so few women after dinner speakers is because few can wait that long.\nA woman is able to forgive and forget, except she will never forget what she forgave.\nThat is one of the mysteries of women.\nIf you have half a mind to watch TV, that's enough.\nVimal, just give it a try. I have nothing against laziness. It is not a sin, it is not a crime; it is only a hindrance to your own spiritual growth. But if you find it impossible and if you find that it is your very nature, then relax in it, it is perfectly good. But first give it a try, because my understanding is that bone lazy people are very rare in the world, they cannot survive.\nHow have I survived? Later on when you start writing about me, make it a miracle!\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nNOTHING TO HOLD ON TO NOWHERE TO BELONG TO NOWHERE TO GO\nBELOVED OSHO, WHY IS IT PAINFUL TO FEEL MY ALONENESS?\nDhyan Parijato, \"Nothing to hold on to, nowhere to belong to, nowhere to go -- why is it painful to feel my aloneness?\"\nWhat am I here for? For the time being hang around me, hold on to me. Go with me wherever I am going. Belong to this caravan which is simply enjoying, not going anywhere.\nIt is not the Jewish caravan that Moses was leading continuously for forty years. And just now they have discovered the reason was they had lost a quarter. They searched the whole Middle East -- it took forty years, and still they could not get it!\nThis caravan is not searching for anything. This caravan is just remaining herenow.\nAnd I am allowing you to hold on to me, belong to me, just as a device because\nyou are feeling so alone. Just the idea that you belong to me, that you can hold on to me, that you go with me, and your painfulness and your feeling of aloneness will disappear. Once it has disappeared you will see that what I have given to you was only teddy bears just for the time being; temporary arrangements to keep you alive to the point where you can live in your aloneness, because aloneness is the most beautiful space there is.\nBut you are in a deep misunderstanding. You are mixed up because of the language and the dictionaries and the so-called learned people who use the word àloneness'\nsynonymously with `loneliness'. Aloneness is experienced only at the very height of consciousness, loneliness in the very dark ditches and valleys. Loneliness is a desire to be with someone, and aloneness is the joy of being oneself. They are not synonymous; they are absolutely opposite.\nIf you are feeling painful, it is loneliness. So just for the time being you need a few teddy bears. All through history those teddy bears have been used. What is your God? --\nnothing but a big teddy bear. What are all your theological systems? -- just teddy bears made out of logical, rational argumentation, to help you and to give you the sense that you are not lonely.\nBut they have all proved dangerous, because if you go on carrying your teddy bear your whole life... It is okay up to a certain age. On railway stations, on airports you will see little boys, little girls carrying their teddy bears, which look absolutely Italian, so greasy, so dirty. But without them they cannot live, they are absolutely lonely. They sleep with them, they wake up with them, they go on carrying them everywhere.\nBut a moment comes when they have grown up and they see that what they have been carrying is just stupidity. Then the teddy bear remains in the corner of the room for a few days, and then nobody knows where it has gone. The corporation truck has taken it away.\nSo will go your God: the corporation truck will take it away with all the rubbish.\nYou don't know anything, Dhyan Parijato, about what aloneness is. Aloneness is that beautiful space where you feel yourself so contented with yourself that you\ndon't need anybody else -- no God, no master, no friend, no lover.\nThat does not mean that you cannot relate. You can relate with a master, but for the first time the relatedness will be of a totally different quality. You can relate in love, but your relatedness will not become a relationship. You can have friends, but they will not be filling any gap inside you. You are so full, there is no gap. You can enjoy their company -\n- and you will enjoy when they are gone even more, because they are a kind of disturbance. Once in a while just for the change of taste you can enjoy people. But mostly you will enjoy yourself.\nI am reminded of one of Walt Whitman's most beautiful songs: \"I celebrate myself.\" You should look into that song and meditate upon it. Unless the moment comes when you start celebrating yourself for no reason at all, you have not known what religiousness is, you have not known for what this whole existence exists, you have not known anything of beauty, of truth, of divineness. Your life has been nothing but a long, dark night of the soul.\nYour meditation will help you to make the distinction between aloneness and loneliness.\nYour meditation will make you absolutely clear about the beauty and the light and the blissfulness of aloneness. Then what is the need to hold on to something? You are enough unto yourself. What is the need to belong to someone or to something? You are complete, entire: the circle has come to its completion. Nothing is missing, and what is the need to go anywhere?\nThe most funny people in the world are the tourists, who are always going somewhere for no reason at all. Whenever I see tourists, I have such a hard time to keep myself silent.\nThey are such a temptation to laugh: carrying two cameras, telescopes, thermos flasks, all kinds of junk and strange things; loaded with all that and running from one place to another. And they do all that running; they go on taking pictures!\nBack at home, relaxed, they will see the album and will say, \"My god, what a beautiful Taj Mahal.\" And they could have purchased that photograph in their own town without going anywhere else.\nAll this tourism has given them amoebas, all kinds of diseases. What they think is beautiful, to me has always looked ugly. It has given them a tan, it has destroyed their original color, just burned their skin. But idiots are idiots. You can see them lying down -\n- suffering, for a distortion of their faces, of their bodies -- on all the beaches of the world.\nIf you want to know how many authentic idiots there are, you just go on counting the number of people who are getting a tan on the sea beaches, and you will come almost very close to the right number. Whenever I see somebody with a tan I cannot practice what I preach. I simply cannot like that stupid act that they have done. And they waste so much money on it: there are tan oils and tan creams and tan powders, and all the five-star hotels are full of these people. A strange kind of mania -- tan mania!\nThere is nowhere to go.\nJust meditate silently here and avoid these kinds of madnesses. They go on spreading like wildfire, and just because others are doing it you get caught into it.\nJust meditation is enough for you.\nGo in, and you will find all the answers for all your questions, and more. Question 3\nBELOVED OSHO,\nWHEN I FIRST CAME TO YOU, YOU TOLD ME TO MAKE WORK MY\nMEDITATION AND TO STOP ALL FORMAL MEDITATIONS. EVER SINCE, I HAVE BEEN GOING FOR IT... AND I LOVE IT!\nLATELY I'VE BEEN WONDERING IF MAYBE I SHOULD SLOW DOWN. YOU\nHAVE BEEN TALKING SO MUCH ABOUT MEDITATION. CAN WORK STILL BE\nOUR MEDITATION? I LOVE WORKING, BUT I GET TEASED A LOT ABOUT\nBEING A WORKAHOLIC.\nVedaprem, condensed to your very essentials the question means: I should slow down talking about meditation. You are doing perfectly well -- and you love it.\nIf people tease you and call you a workaholic, it is a compliment. These people must be lazy people like Vimal! All the people here are meditating, and if you are enjoying the meditation that I have given to you -- that work is your meditation -- and you are enjoying it and you love it, then why bother about others? Perhaps they are feeling jealous of you. Perhaps they want to destroy your joy.\nThis is a strange world. Here anybody who succeeds in any sphere is going to be teased, dragged down, bullied by the people saying, \"You are doing something wrong.\" And all that they want is that you should be a part of the crowd of failures.\nAs far as I can see you are doing perfectly well. Perhaps I may have done too much talking about meditation. I will try to slow down.\nA traveling salesman was stuck in a small town and went to the only available farmhouse for a place to sleep.\n\"Can you put me up for the night?\" he asked the farmer.\n\"I guess I can,\" he answered, \"if you don't mind sharing a room with my young son.\"\n\"My God,\" said the salesman, \"I'm in the wrong joke.\"\nThis is your situation; you are in a wrong crowd. But don't look around at anybody; just concentrate, contemplate, meditate on your work. Everything has to be poured into work.\nYes, be a workaholic.\nBe utterly drunk with the joy of creativity.\nI have not said it in vain, that work is your meditation. Apparently I am bone lazy, but just apparently; otherwise, who is harassing you all, day in, day out? By the time somehow you have got rested I am again back in the morning to torture you for the whole day. By the time you have slowed down a little -- I am back!\nA young swami on his way to M.G. Road fell out of his rickshaw. And as luck would have it, he landed in heaven.\nAfter a few days' rest, he asked for some work. Finally he was given a position in the\n\"Religious Statistics Department.\"\nHere they had a clock for every religious leader on the earth, and any sins committed by them would be recorded by a slight movement forward.\nThe pope's clock had moved only two minutes in sixty-seven years. Mother Teresa's only one minute, and so on.\nThe swami enquired to the angel in charge, \"What about Osho's clock?\" \"Oh,\" said the angel, \"we use his as a desk fan!\"\nJust to avoid talking about meditation...\nThere was a German, a Frenchman and an Englishman staying with their new brides at a famous honeymoon hotel. As they retired to bed they agreed that they would get together the next day and exchange experiences over some drinks.\nThe next day the German was asked, \"How did you get on last night?\"\n\"Ach, vunce to begin wid, then vunce one hour later, und every time the clock struck, vunce again, vich vass eight times in eight hours.\"\n\"And what did your wife say?\" \"Wunderbar, wunderbar!!\"\nThe Frenchman told them, \"I am straight away on the work. Zen I am on the work again when I get back my breath. Zen I sleep and start again, and sleep and\nstart again, and sleep and start again, twenty times. Then I am halted, finis.\" \"What did your wife say?\"\n\"Magnifique, encore, magnifique!!\"\nThe Englishman had been very quiet. \"Come tell us, how many?\" \"Once,\" he said.\n\"Once! -- what did your wife say at dawn?\" \"Get off, we need some sleep.\"\nI am in a difficulty -- how to avoid meditation? Only today I will avoid, not tomorrow, because I don't want difficult tasks.\nJust for your sake...\nDevageet falls in love with an eighteen-year-old girl and they go off to Goa for a honeymoon. When they get back, a friend says to him, \"Do tell me, how was it?\"\n\"It was beautiful,\" says Devageet. \"The sun, the sea... we made love almost every night.\"\n\"Wait a minute,\" says his friend. \"A man of your age -- how did you manage that?\"\n\"Well,\" says Devageet. \"We almost made love on Monday, almost on Tuesday...\" Okay, Vimal?\nYes, Osho.\nThe Great Pilgrimage: From Here to Here Chapter #18\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"12454","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_great_pilgrimage_from_here_to_here/part5/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_great_pilgrimage_from_here_to_here/>The Great Pilgrimage From Here to Here</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: Innocence regained</h1><div class=post-meta>59 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;12454 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Great_Pilgrimage_From_Here_to_Here/part5.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part4>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

CHILDLIKE FEELING. IT SEEMS SO FAMILIAR, YET FROM A LONG</p><p>TIME AGO. IN THESE MOMENTS THERE FEELS NO GAP OF YOU AND ME. I AM
LIKE A CHILD PLAYING IN YOUR BEAUTIFUL GARDEN.</p><p>BELOVED OSHO, IS THIS SIGNIFICANT OR AM I ALREADY MOVING INTO MY</p><p>SECOND CHILDHOOD AT THE RIPE OLD AGE OF THIRTY-FIVE?</p><p>P.S. YOU CAN SCARE ME ANY TIME.</p><p>Prem Yatra, this great experiment through which you all are passing
is basically to achieve your lost childhood again.</p><p>When I say "your lost childhood," I mean your innocence, your eyes
full of wonder, knowing nothing, having nothing, but yet feeling
yourself at the top of the world. Those golden moments of wonder, joy,
no tension, no worry, no anxiety, have to be regained, rediscovered. The
sage is nothing but the circle that started in your birth coming full
way, complete, back to the same point.</p><p>Of course the second childhood is far more valuable and significant
than the first. In the first the innocence was there because of
ignorance, so it was not pure and clear and in your possession; it was
just a natural thing that happens to every childhood. The second
childhood is your greatest achievement -- it does not happen to all. The
second childhood makes you innocent without ignorance, the second
childhood comes through all kinds of experiences. It is mature,
centered, ripe.</p><p>You should be blessed that you are feeling like that. The second
childhood is just exactly the existential meaning of meditation, and
from there on is the great pilgrimage of coming back home -- which you
have never really left, which is impossible to leave, because it is you.
Wherever you will go, you will find yourself there.</p><p>It is not even a shadow which follows you because that will disappear
if you are sitting in the shade. It will appear only when you are
standing in the sunlight. Your shadow is not an eternal companion, and
in times of darkness even your shadow itself leaves you. But in the
times of light your shadow is back.</p><p>The same is the situation with friends, lovers: in the days of
darkness they leave you just like the shadow; in the days of success,
richness, they all come back. They are not really companions.</p><p>There is only one essential being in you which will be everywhere
with you,</p><p>without any condition. Even if you are in hell it doesn't matter, it
will be with you; if you are in heaven it doesn't matter, it will be
with you.</p><p>To find that essential core of your being is on the one hand utter
innocence, and on the other hand is the greatest wisdom that has ever
existed on the earth.</p><p>So your body may be becoming old, but if you are learning ways of
being silent and peaceful and meditative and loving, you will not grow
old. You will remain as young and as fresh as early morning dewdrops
shining in the beautiful sunrise, looking far more precious than any
pearls.</p><p>You should be happy and rejoice in your childhood. This is what Jesus
meant when he said again and again, "Unless you are born again..." Even
Christians have not got the meaning of his statement. They think
literally that "unless you are born again" means that first you will
have to die, and then you will be born, and on the judgment day Jesus
will take you into paradise. That is not the meaning of the man.</p><p>What he is saying is: Unless you die right now as a personality and
emerge as an innocent individuality, unscratched, unpolluted by the
society and the people... This is your new birth, this is
resurrection.</p><p>Enjoy your divine childhood, and when it is the right time I will
scare you! You are too new; the childhood is not yet absolutely settled,
and you can misunderstand if I scare you.</p><p>Just wait...! That moment will also come. Right now your whole
concern should be getting deeper into childhood.</p><p>I don't scare anybody except Avirbhava, because she has a quality of
a child. I don't know why. Perhaps her father is dead, her mother is
dead... I feel a tremendous feeling for her -</p><p>- and she is utterly innocent. So once in a while -- not once in a
while, almost every day --</p><p>whenever I have the chance and she is close by, I try to do my
best.</p><p>"I don't want your son, Ernie, swimming in our pool anymore" says
Mrs. Meyer to her neighbor, Mrs. Jones.</p><p>"But what has my poor little Ernie done?" asks Mrs. Jones. "He is
constantly peeing in the pool," says Mrs. Meyer angrily.</p><p>"Don't be so hard on him," says Mrs. Jones, "all children of his age
do that!" "Maybe they do," says Mrs. Meyer, "but not from the diving
board."</p><p>Childhood has its beauties, because it does not know the etiquette,
the manners, and all kinds of crap. It is so simple and so innocent and
so spontaneous.</p><p>A man walked into a bar and was amazed to see a dog sitting at a
table with three men playing poker. The man went over and asked, "Can
that dog really read his cards?"</p><p>"Sure he can," said one of the men. "But he's not much of a player.
Whenever he draws a good hand he wags his tail!"</p><p>That is absolutely innocent... the poor dog cannot contain his
joy.</p><p>Two cockroaches were munching delicacies on top of a garbage pile
when one of them began telling of some new tenants in the nearby
apartments.</p><p>"I hear," he said, "that their refrigerator is spotless, their floors
are gleaming, and there is not a speck of dust in the whole place."</p><p>"Please, please," said the other cockroach, "not while I'm eating!"
Such bad news...!</p><p>It will be a tremendous revolution the day we start learning the
languages of birds, of bees, of cockroaches. They all have their ways of
communicating. But then the heart feels a little sadness, because we
have not been able to learn even to communicate with human beings, and
we have been here for millions of years. What kind of stupidity is this,
that we don't know the whole humanity as belonging to us and we
belonging to it? All that man has done is simply butchering, murdering,
war. The same energy, the same effort would have made this world the
greatest miracle in the whole universe.</p><p>But we don't understand each other. We may even be speaking the
same</p><p>language, but understanding is not necessarily expected; what is
expected is misunderstanding. So people are hiding themselves, hiding
their childhood, hiding their innocence, protecting themselves from
everybody with defense measures; otherwise you will see children young
and old all playing in this garden of the earth, rejoicing, laughing,
giggling. Why this seriousness? Man has not gained anything out of this
seriousness; he has simply lost everything -- but he continues to be
serious.</p><p>I am absolutely against seriousness. I call it a psychological
sickness.</p><p>Only a playful, childlike, innocent behavior is the right behavior,
is what I would like to call virtuous behavior, religious, spiritual...
not only human but divine.</p><p>The moment you are as innocent as a child you have transcended
humanity, you have entered into the world of godliness.</p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>I LOVE THE WORDS YOU USE, "ONE'S ORIGINAL FACE," BUT I HAVE NO</p><p>EXISTENTIAL GLIMPSE OR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT YOU MEAN BY</p><p>THEM. WOULD YOU CARE TO EXPLAIN FURTHER?</p><p>Veena, the original face is only a poetic expression for your
absolute innocence, which is not damaged by your parents, by your
teachers, by your society, by your culture and by yourself.</p><p>I can understand why you love those words... because you don't have
the original face.</p><p>And the reason you don't have the original face is... You are trying
hard for it, but whenever I look at you there is a certain pretension, a
certain hypocrisy. There is no bad intention in your being, but you want
to look the way you should</p><p>look, and that is destroying the whole thing. You should look the way
you are.</p><p>Drop all nonsense that has been imposed on you with all those
commandments that religions have been issuing, without any respect to
the uniqueness of individuals.</p><p>Just be yourself.</p><p>That's the meaning of the original face.</p><p>It is just a poetic expression to say to you: Don't try in any way to
look more beautiful, to look more meditative, to look more respectful.
Those are deadly poisons... the very desire to look like somebody who
you are not.</p><p>My whole teaching is: Just be what you are and don't care a bit about
the world. Then you will feel a tremendous relaxation and a deep peace
within your heart. That is your original face, relaxed, without
tensions, without pretensions, without hypocrisies, without the
so-called disciplines of how you should behave.</p><p>But all those poisons have gone deep in your blood, in your bones, in
your marrow. What I am trying to do is to take out those poisons and
give you back your naturalness. And there is nothing more beautiful than
the natural, there is nothing more mysterious than the original; no
etiquette, no mannerism can improve upon it.</p><p>But everybody is trying to improve upon himself. Then everything
becomes false. Your smile is false, your hands raised together folded in
reverence are just an exercise of the hands -- your heart is not with
them. And unfortunately I have such eyes that I can see exactly where
the trouble is; when everybody is laughing there are serious and sober
people who are pretending to hold their laughter, because it doesn't
look right.</p><p>Veena, you have been a long, long time with me, but I have never felt
that you are relaxed, at ease, at home. Just being at ease, relaxed, at
home, all these poor trees know what is the original face, these birds
know what is the original face. Only man has forgotten, because he has
found masks upon masks; he is lost in the jungle of masks, and now it is
very difficult to find which is the original.</p><p>But a simple understanding... whenever you see yourself tense,
remember that you are doing something against nature. Whenever you are
doing something more special than others, remember that you are trying
to be superior, behaving as a great meditator, behaving as a real
English lady. English ladies don't have original faces!</p><p>Drop all this nonsense of being English and German and Indian. I see
Indians here once in a while, and even in the tumultuous laughter of you
all I can detect them; either they will laugh louder than anybody to
show that they are not the Indians I condemn, or they will just look
downwards to hide their face, because they have lost the intelligence to
understand even a simple joke. And rather than enjoying the moment, they
are judging continuously whether it is right to tell a joke in a
religious discourse.… Who told you this is a religious discourse? I hate
the very word! I just enjoy to be with you.</p><p>This very enjoyment is our religiousness.</p><p>We don't have anything except ourselves. And condemned by the whole
world, which is a big world, still we have our simplicity, our
innocence; we have got rid of all old garbage. Just allow yourself to
come out of the cage that you yourself have been creating... and others
have been helping.</p><p>The original face is a beautiful poetic expression, but it does not
mean that you will have a different face. This same face will lose all
its tensions, this same face will be relaxed, this same face will be
nonjudgmental, this same face will not think of others as inferior.</p><p>This same face under these new values will be your original face.</p><p>There is an ancient proverb: Many a hero is a man who did not have
the courage to be a coward. If you are a coward what is wrong in it? You
are a coward -- it is perfectly good.</p><p>Cowards are also needed, otherwise from where will you get heroes?
They are an absolute necessity to give the background to create
heroes.</p><p>Just be yourself, whatever it is. The problem is that never before
has anybody told you just to be yourself. Everybody is poking his nose
in, saying that you should be this way, you should be that way -- even
in ordinary matters.</p><p>In my school... I was just a small boy, but I hated to be told how I
have to be. Teachers started bribing me -- "If you behave rightly, you
can become a genius."</p><p>I said, "Hell with the genius -- I simply want to be myself."</p><p>I used to sit with my legs on the table, and every teacher was
offended. They would say,</p><p>"What kind of behavior is this?"</p><p>I said, "The table is not saying anything to me. It is something
between me and the table, so why are you looking so angry? I am not
putting my legs on your head! You should relax just as I am relaxing.
And this way I feel better able to understand what nonsense you are
teaching."</p><p>Just beside the room was a beautiful window, and outside were trees
and birds and cuckoos. Mostly I was looking out of the window, and the
teacher would come and say,</p><p>"Why do you come to school at all?"</p><p>I said, "Because in my house there is no window like this which opens
up to the whole sky, and around my house there are no cuckoos, no birds.
The house is in the city, surrounded by other houses, so crowded that
birds don't come there, cuckoos don't feel that these are the people to
be blessed by their songs.</p><p>"Forget the idea that I come here to listen to you! I am paying my
fee, you are simply a servant and you should remember that. If I fail I
will not come to complain to you; if I fail I will not feel sad. But if
for the whole year I have to pretend that I am listening to you, and I
am listening to the cuckoos outside, that will be the beginning of a
hypocritical life. And I don't want to be a hypocrite."</p><p>On every matter the teachers, the professors wanted you to do it in a
certain way. In my school in those days, and perhaps even today, using a
cap was necessary. I have nothing against caps; since I have left the
university I have started using caps, but I never wore one until I left
the university. The first teacher who was worried about me, said, "You
are disturbing the discipline of the school. Where is your cap?"</p><p>I said, "Bring the school code of behavior. Is there any mention that
every boy</p><p>should use a cap? And if there is not, you are imposing something
against the school code."</p><p>He took me to the principal of the school and I told the principal,
"I am absolutely ready, just show me where it is written that a cap is
compulsory. If it is compulsory, I may even leave the school, but first
let me see where it is written."</p><p>There was no written code and I said, "Can you give me any other
reasonable arguments for using the cap? Will it increase my
intelligence? Will it increase my life? Will it give me better health,
more understanding?" I said, "As far as I know, Bengal is the only
province in India where caps are not used, and that is the most
intelligent part of the country. Punjab is just the opposite. There for
a cap, people use turbans -- such big turbans, as if their intelligence
is escaping so they are keeping it. And that is the most unintelligent
part of the country."</p><p>The principal said, "There seems to be some sense in what you are
saying, but it is a school discipline. If you stop using caps, then
others will stop."</p><p>I said, "Then what is the fear? Just drop the whole old
convention."</p><p>Nobody wants to allow you to be yourself on matters which are
absolutely insignificant.</p><p>I used to have long hair in my childhood. And I used to come in and
out of my father's shop, because the shop and the home were connected.
The home was behind the shop and it was absolutely necessary to pass
through the shop. People would ask, "Whose girl is this?" -- because my
hair was so long, they could not think that a boy should be having such
long hair.</p><p>My father felt very ashamed and embarrassed to say, "He is a boy."
But they said, "Then why all this hair?"</p><p>One day -- it was not his normal nature -- he became so embarrassed
and angry that he came and cut my hair with his own hands. Bringing the
scissors with which he used to cut cloth in his shop, he cut my hair. I
didn't say anything to him -- he was surprised. He said,</p><p>"You don't have anything to say?"</p><p>I said, "I will say it in my own way." "So what do you mean?"</p><p>I said, "You will see." And I went to the opium-addict barber who
used to have a shop just in front of our house. He was the only man I
had a respect for. There were a row of barber shops, but I loved that
old man. He was a rare variety, and he loved me; for hours we used to
talk to each other. What he was saying was all nonsense! One day he was
saying to me, "If all the opium addicts can be organized into a
political party, we can take over this country!"</p><p>I said, "It is a good idea."</p><p>But he said, "Because we are all opium addicts, I myself forget my
own idea."</p><p>I said, "You don't be worried. I am here and I will remember. You
just tell me what changes you want to have in the country, what kind of
political ideology you want, and I will manage it."</p><p>He said, "That's good."</p><p>So I went to him and I told him, "Just shave my whole head
completely." In India the head is shaved completely only when your
father dies.</p><p>For a moment even that opium addict came to his senses. He said,
"What has happened?</p><p>Has your father died?"</p><p>I said, "Don't bother about these things. You do what I am saying; it
is none of your concern! You just cut my hair completely, shave it
completely."</p><p>He said, "Done! That is the easiest job. So many times I get into
trouble. People say to me, `Shave the beard,' and I forget and I shave
their heads. They say,</p><p>`What have you done?' And I say, Àt the most I can say to you don't
pay for it -- what is the problem?'"</p><p>I used to sit in his shop, because there was always something so
ridiculous happening. He would cut half the mustache of somebody and
would say, "Wait, I have remembered some urgent work." And the man would
say, "But I am caught</p><p>here in your chair and half the mustache is gone. I cannot go out of
the shop!" He would say, "Simply wait there."</p><p>And then hours will pass and that man is sitting there..."What kind
of idiot is this man?"</p><p>At one time I had to help by cutting the half mustache of a man. I
said, "Now you are free. Just never come back here again... because that
man has not done much harm to you, he just forgets."</p><p>So the barber said, "That's right. It is none of my concern. If he
has died, he has died."</p><p>He shaved my head completely, and I went home. I passed through the
shop. My father looked and all his customers looked. They said, "What
happened? Whose boy is this? His father has died."</p><p>My father said, "He is my boy and I am alive! But I knew he was going
to do something.</p><p>He has answered me well."</p><p>Wherever I went people would ask, "What happened? He was perfectly
healthy."</p><p>I said, "People die at any age. You are worried about him, you are
not worried about my hairs."</p><p>That was the last thing my father ever did to me, because he knew
that the answer could be more dangerous! On the contrary, he brought a
certain oil that is used for growing hair. It is a very costly oil,
comes from Bengal out of a certain flower, javakusum. It is very costly,
rare, used only by the richest people -- and not by men but by women --
to keep the hair as long as possible. In Bengal I have come across women
whose hair touched the earth -- five feet long, six feet long. That oil
simply functions powerfully on the hairs.</p><p>I said, "Now you understand."</p><p>He said, "I have understood. You use this oil quickly; in a few
months your hair will be back."</p><p>I said, "You created the whole mess. What was there to be embarrassed
about? You could have said, `She is my girl.' I don't have any objection
about that. But you should not have interfered with me the way you did.
It was violent, barbarous. Rather than saying anything to me, you simply
started cutting my hair."</p><p>Nobody allows anybody to be just himself. And you have learned all
those ideas so deeply that it seems they are your ideas. Just relax.
Forget all those conditionings, drop them like dry leaves falling from
the trees. It is better to be a naked tree without any leaves than to
have plastic leaves and plastic foliage and plastic flowers; that is
ugly.</p><p>The original face simply means that you are not being dominated by
any kind of morality, religion, society, parents, teachers, priests, not
being dominated by anyone. Just living your life according to your own
inner sense -- you have a sensibility -- and you will have the original
face.</p><p>The young teacher wrote on the blackboard, "I ain't had no fun all
summer." Then she asked the children, "What is wrong with that sentence
and what do I do to correct it?"</p><p>Little Ernie shouted from the back, "Get a boyfriend."</p><p>The sentence will be corrected by itself -- just get a boyfriend!</p><p>This is the simple original face; it doesn't bother about
consequences. But England is perhaps the most attached to false
personalities.…</p><p>Elizabeth and Philip had been married for a considerable time, and it
became particularly apparent to Philip that Elizabeth had lost all
enthusiasm for their lovemaking.</p><p>On a recent occasion, Philip was making love to his wife when he
suddenly said, "Is something the matter? Are you hurt?"</p><p>"No, I'm all right," answered Elizabeth. "Why do you ask?" "Oh," said
Philip, "for a moment there, I thought you moved."</p><p>People have become absolutely dead. And Veena comes from that same
lot of</p><p>lunatics!</p><p>Just enjoy and be at ease with yourself and with the world, and the
original face starts shining by itself.</p><p>When the doctor had finished his examination of the woman, he looked
up and said brightly, "Mrs. Brown, I have good news for you."</p><p>"I'm glad of that, doctor," said the woman, "But I am MISS
Brown."</p><p>"Miss Brown," said the doctor, without changing expression, "I have
bad news for you."</p><p>There are many people whose expressions will not change. Now such a
great change --</p><p>from Mrs. Brown to Miss Brown -- but the doctor is keeping his
personality, his face, absolutely without change.</p><p>Whenever I look at Veena I feel very sad for her... no expression,
sits just like a marble statue. She is beautiful. She will make a good
model if you want to make a marble statue.</p><p>But it seems she is holding back from life; she is not allowing the
playfulness and the joy that are our birthright. That is why the words
òriginal face' strike her. It looks immensely intriguing -- but she
cannot understand what it means. It does not mean another face; it
simply means no face imposed upon that which you have got from nature
itself.</p><p>One needs a little courage, a little daring, just to be himself
whatever the circumstances.</p><p>And on the whole, every circumstance and every consequence -- even if
you have to suffer -- will enrich your individuality, will make your
intelligence sharper, will give you a sense of direction which comes
from your own inner being and is not given by some guide from
outside.</p><p>Question 3 BELOVED MASTER,</p><p>EVERY TIME I MANAGE TO CLUTCH A STRAW YOU STEP ON MY FINGERS.</p><p>MY BRAIN IS TOTALLY SCRAMBLED. MY WHOLE WORLD SEEMS UNREAL.</p><p>YOU GOT ME INTO THIS MESS -- ARE YOU GOING TO GET ME OUT, OR IS</p><p>THAT UP TO ME?</p><p>Prem Nayana, the first thing is: I am going to get you into a deeper
mess, because unless you touch the rock bottom of your mess, it is very
difficult to get out of it.</p><p>Do you know how to swim? Have you ever drowned in a river? -- and
what happens?</p><p>You have to go first to the bottom and then at the bottom you are
thrown up. That is why dead people know the secret but the living people
don't. You will not see any dead person drowning -- he simply floats,
and living people get drowned. They say they don't know swimming, but
dead people are swimming perfectly well!</p><p>So as far as I am concerned I am not going to get you out of the
mess. I will manage every way to take you to the rock bottom, then you
will pop up on your own.</p><p>And what do you mean, "Every time I manage to clutch a straw you step
on my fingers"?</p><p>Just don't clutch at any straw. It is so easy...! And you know me
perfectly well. I will not let you clutch at any straw, because those
straws are not going to save you; I will step on your fingers. You
cannot make me stop, but you can do one thing: stop clutching at
straws.</p><p>She is speaking in a very poetic way. To translate it into pragmatic
language, she is saying that whenever she starts believing in some
principle, I demolish it. Whenever she starts creating a system of
beliefs and finds a consolation in that belief system, I destroy it.</p><p>My way of creating goes through a long passage of destroying, because
the real work is to destroy -- and then you will come out of it. You
don't have to be created. You are there already, dumped with so much
garbage that I have to take that garbage away. And you are
clutching...!</p><p>Never try to make a system of beliefs out of what I am saying. If you
understand me well, I am not a system maker and I don't want believers,
I don't want followers. I don't want anybody to think that I am the
savior.</p><p>I don't even shave my own beard! Nirvano goes on saying to me, "I can
trim it a little."</p><p>I say, "No, absolutely no! These are my original hairs. I have never
shaved my beard.</p><p>They are the same original hairs as when they first had started
growing in my youth, and I am going to keep them to the very last."</p><p>She feels worried that they will become thinner, that this beard will
become too long. I said, "Don't be worried. Even if it starts touching
the ground, I am always in favor of the original."</p><p>One very essential thing which I have been telling you, but I have to
repeat it, is: Feel me more than my words, feel my presence more than my
presentation. I am not a philosopher. I am incurably a mystic. There is
no medicine which can cure me.</p><p>But if you go on... and this has happened with thousands of people;
in these thirty years I must have come across millions of people, but
they were all seeking some savior -- and I walked on their fingers. They
were all seeking somebody to take away their responsibility, without
knowing that the moment your responsibility is gone, your freedom is
also gone. They exist together; they are inseparable.</p><p>If you want freedom, you have to accept every responsibility. If you
want freedom, you don't have to clutch with your hands onto any belief,
philosophy, religion. You just be yourself. Why can't you enjoy yourself
consciously? There is no intrinsic necessity for having a belief.</p><p>Thousands of people have come to me and gone. There was a time I
was</p><p>surrounded by Jainas. Unfortunately I was born in a Jaina family, so
naturally my first audience was of Jainas. They were immensely happy
because I was saying things which they had never thought about, I was
interpreting their scriptures in a totally new way. They had great hope
in me. They thought that...</p><p>Their religion has remained very small; it is the smallest religion
in India. And it is the ancientmost religion -- it is more ancient than
Hinduism. But what calamity has happened? Even today there are not more
than thirty-five lakhs of Jainas in a country of nine hundred million
people. What has happened? Jainism is at least seven thousand years old
-- that is at least. It can be more, older, because in Harrappur and in
Mohanjodro two ancient cities have been excavated, and Jaina statues
have been found in those cities.</p><p>Now it is a scientific fact that those cities were destroyed
somewhere between seven thousand and ten thousand years ago, and that is
a very conservative estimate. But even if we take that estimate, in ten
thousand years the population of the Jainas has remained negligible --
thirty-five lakhs. That is not worth any consideration! That is why in
the great religions of the world Jainism is never counted -- never
counted with Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism. They are great
religions, and they are all very new as far as Jainism is concerned.</p><p>Because of my interpretations they had a tremendous hope in me, that
perhaps I may spread their religion to the whole world, take the message
to the whole world. But they were unaware -- they were my first audience
-- they were not aware what kind of man I am: I cannot support anything
which my heart is not ready to support.</p><p>So a few things I have supported in Jainism -- people were very
happy. But the moment I started telling about things which I cannot
support, they were shocked. I have walked on their fingers. Just a small
thing -- which is so rational -- and the Jaina community... their
supreme command decided to expel me. I wrote a letter to them saying,
"Don't be stupid.</p><p>I expel you all from my life. You don't have to expel me; you cannot.
I am no more part of you."</p><p>And what was the reason? I addressed a Jaina conference and told
them, "You are the oldest vegetarians of the world. You eat the purest
food, but you have not produced a single Nobel prize winner. What is
your contribution to art, to music,</p><p>to science, to mathematics, to painting, to poetry? What is your
contribution to the world? There are the Jews who get forty percent of
all the Nobel prizes, and the rest of the world has to live only on
sixty percent."</p><p>And I told them, "The reason is -- I have deeply enquired into the
matter -- that in vegetarian food something is missing which is
necessary for intelligence. That is why you have remained retarded."</p><p>Vegetarian food is not complete, and particularly for intelligence
certain vitamins are missing. Those vitamins can be found in meat.
Certainly I cannot support non-vegetarian food. Even though it gives you
better intelligence, it destroys your very soul; it makes you cruel,
violent, inhuman.</p><p>So I suggested to them, "I have found something which should be
immediately accepted if any intelligence is left in you, and that is
eating eggs which are not fertilized, non-fertilized eggs. They are not
living, there is no life. If you leave them they will simply rot and
disappear. There is no life in them because the male sperm has not
entered into the mother's egg; the mother has grown the egg without the
male sperm. It is not alive, so there is no harm in eating it. It is
vegetarian."</p><p>Suddenly they were very angry. I am suggesting for them to eat eggs,
and they are afraid even to eat tomatoes, because tomatoes look like
meat -- just the color, poor tomatoes...</p><p>How can they conceive of themselves eating non-fertilized eggs?
Somebody stood up and said, "Maybe that is right that they are not
living, but they are coming from animals."</p><p>I said, "So is milk; what is the difference? If you are avoiding
anything that is coming from any living being, your children are from
the very beginning against Jainism; they are drinking their mother's
milk. And you are drinking milk" -- and Jainas drink milk and milk-made
products more than anybody. They cannot enjoy meat and non-vegetarian
foods, so to substitute they have invented thousands of ways of
delicacies made of milk products.</p><p>But the very word ègg' was enough for them to leave me completely;
the Jainas disappeared. I was dangerous! I was teaching something that
they have never done in ten thousand years. No scripture of theirs
suggests anything about it. But they were absolutely unable to answer my
questions -- "If you are eating the</p><p>purest food, your intelligence should have been the purest flame, the
sharpest genius, the most creative, but it has not been so." And
immediately -- they had come to me because they thought I was supporting
their system, but I am not supporting anybody's system -- they
disappeared.</p><p>Then the second gang was of Gandhians. For a little while it was
okay, but the moment I criticized Mahatma Gandhi... nobody had any
answer for it, but the Gandhians disappeared. I had stepped on their
fingers! And as the Gandhians disappeared, immediately socialists,
communists gathered around me, not knowing that the same is going to be
their fate.</p><p>Of course, from each group a few courageous people have remained. A
few Jains have remained, a few Gandhians have remained, who had the
intelligence to understand that I am not against anybody, but I cannot
support anything which is fundamentally wrong, and is harmful to human
life.</p><p>The communists were very happy, because they were in search of a
man... The only calamity for the communists in India is that they don't
have a saintly figure. They don't attract the masses, and the masses
will never be attracted to communists, because they cannot think that
someone who is speaking to them and also smoking a cigarette and putting
it in the ashtray in between can be a leader. This is impossible for the
Indian masses. And because communists don't believe in God, are against
all religions, Indians cannot have any communion with them.</p><p>You will be surprised that in the Russian revolution there was one
Indian as important as Lenin himself. His name was Edmund Roy; he was an
international figure in the communist movement. Thinking that he was so
much respected internationally by the communists, he came to India, back
to his home, and here he came in conflict with Mahatma Gandhi
immediately. He was right on many more points than Mahatma Gandhi, but
that is not how the masses decide. He smoked cigarettes, he drank vodka,
he has lived in Russia, he believed in violence: he is intolerable!</p><p>So when the communists saw that the Gandhians were angry with me,
they thought it was an opportunity. If I can be their representative, it
will be an immense help for them to gain power in India, because they
have heard that I don't believe in any religions; they have heard there
is no God, no heaven, no hell. They felt, "This seems to be perfectly
agreeing with us."</p><p>In fact, my emphasis was far deeper than their own philosophy. So
when I said that there are no religions, but there is something higher
than religion and that is religiousness; there is no God as a person,
but as a presence, and the whole universe is full of godliness... I
walked on their fingers! Immediately all communists disappeared from my
audience. But a few courageous souls have remained, and have become
accustomed to my stepping on their fingers. And they have learned one
secret: With me it is not ideas that matter.</p><p>With me it is your transformation that matters.</p><p>And your transformation is possible only if your mind slowly, slowly
becomes calm and quiet.</p><p>So now I have my own people. But once in a while a stranger
accidentally gets caught.</p><p>Now I have been enquiring about that sannyasin Piyoosh, whether he
has reached Igatpuri and Goenka or not; otherwise he should be loaded in
a truck and sent to Igatpuri.</p><p>This is not his place. But he is hiding. He has not approached the
office. He has not approached Swami Dhyan Yogi, who initiates
sannyasins, to return his papers. So once in a while somebody who does
not understand my way of working, gets into unnecessary trouble.</p><p>I am not interested in how many people are meditating; it is not my
responsibility. I am fulfilled and absolutely content. If death comes
this moment I will not even tell death,</p><p>"Wait a few minutes more; let me finish my speech." What is the
point? I am always ready; in the middle of the sentence I can stop. I
have no desires, no longings, no stupid superiority complex of being a
prophet or a messiah or a messenger of God. That is why I can speak to
you now heart to heart.</p><p>When I call you my people, it simply means you are no longer Hindus,
no longer Christians, no longer Jews, that you have dropped all that
rubbish away, that you have come to me as an individual on your own
authority. And I will not give you new chains to console you.</p><p>You are saying to me, "You got me into this mess." You are wrong,
Prem</p><p>Nayana, you got into this mess on your own accord. I never go and
knock on people's doors -- but it is so easy to throw away the
responsibility, without knowing you are throwing away your freedom too.
I cannot accept the responsibility because I cannot destroy your
freedom. I love you too much.</p><p>And now you are saying, "You got me into this mess -- are you going
to get me out, or is it up to me?" It has been always up to you whether
to get into the mess or get out of it. It is none of my business. I have
never bothered.… Millions of people have passed by my side, people who
were ready to die for me, or were ready to kill me just if I said
something that went against their prejudices -- the same people.</p><p>It has been a tremendously rich life of experiences, but now I am
absolutely finished with taking anybody's responsibility, destroying
anybody's freedom. You are here on your own accord. Whatever happens to
you, you are responsible; it is happening out of your freedom. I respect
your freedom so much that I cannot take the responsibility.</p><p>Just meditate over the whole matter, and you will see this is not a
place where one gets into a mess; this is a place where we dry-clean
you! All the mess that you bring with you, we take it away... slowly, so
it does not hurt you too much. But one has to be very alert and very
intelligent if he wants to remain with me. I am not here for retarded
idiots.</p><p>The worried wife came to the doctor and said, "Doctor, I don't know
what is wrong with my husband. He has sudden changes. Monday he liked
milk- pudding, Tuesday he liked milk-pudding, Wednesday he liked
milk-pudding, Thursday he liked milk-pudding, and all of a sudden, today
he does not like milk-pudding."</p><p>This is not the place for such idiots, who can't understand simple
things.</p><p>Moishe Finkelstein met his old friend Sam Feigenbaum on the street in
Moscow. "Did you hear," said Moishe, "that old Yossel Mosovith has
died?"</p><p>"No," said Sam, "I did not even hear that he had been arrested."</p><p>A man was having his fiftieth birthday and his wife wanted to give
him something really special. They had been married for twenty-five
years and had</p><p>the perfect marriage.</p><p>"What's something you have never had on your birthday?" she asked. He
looked coy and she said, "Come on, it is okay -- anything you want."
"Well," he said, "I have never had a whore."</p><p>"Okay," she said, "I will get you the best."</p><p>So she booked him a very classy whore for the whole night. When he
came home the next day she asked, "Did you enjoy yourself?"</p><p>"Yes," he said shyly.</p><p>"Well, did she do anything I don't do?" "Yes," he said modestly.</p><p>"Well, what was it?" she said. "She moaned," said the husband.</p><p>So the next time they were making love, the wife kept saying, "Shall
I moan yet?"</p><p>"Not yet," he would say.</p><p>Then finally he was about to climax and he said, "Okay start moaning,
start moaning!"</p><p>So the wife said, "Oh my God! I have had a terrible day, your mother
came, the vacuum cleaner broke, my hair is a mess "</p><p>Prem Nayana, this is a place of laughter and love, of joy and
celebration. According to me it is the only holy place in the world.
Just be careful not to clutch any straw, because then I cannot resist
the temptation of stepping on your fingers. The responsibility is
yours.</p><p>Okay, Vimal?</p><p>Yes, Osho.</p><p>The Great Pilgrimage: From Here to Here Chapter #17</p><p>Chapter title: On the master's operating table</p><p>14 September 1987 pm in Gautam the Buddha Auditorium Archive</p><p>code:</p><p>8709145</p><p>ShortTitle:</p><p>PILGR17</p><p>Audio:</p><p>Yes Video:</p><p>Yes Length:</p><p>83</p><p>mins Question 1</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>THE OTHER DAY WHEN YOU SAID THAT I WAS "COMING ALONG FINE, SLOW BUT
STEADY." FOR ME, IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL STATEMENT. BUT IT</p><p>TOUCHED AN OLD WOUND THAT I WAS HARDLY AWARE OF.</p><p>THE WOUND COMES FROM SCHOOL AND BEING OFTEN TOLD THAT I WAS</p><p>SLOW, A BIT DIM, NOT VERY INTELLIGENT AND DEFINITELY NEEDED TO</p><p>TRY HARDER.</p><p>AND LISTENING TO YOU I HAD THE FEELING THAT MAYBE ALL THIS WAS</p><p>TRUE. IS IT?</p><p>Vimal, it is of great understanding on your part that you have not
blamed me because I have touched your old wound. It hurts. But unless
all the wounds are opened to the sun, to the wind, they will go on
growing underneath; they can become cancerous.</p><p>Many people, many more than the people who are suffering from
physical cancer, are suffering from psychological cancer. And the only
way to remove a psychological cancer is to expose it. If there is love
and trust, then you will not start getting angry or hurt, because I am
nothing but your physician. And just out of my love I have to hit you
--</p><p>sometimes very hard, because the crust that is covering your wound
has become very thick.</p><p>Your question reminded me of Veena. She had asked a question this
morning. I had looked all around -- she was not here. Although I knew
why she was not here, I have also enquired. And the reason she has given
is that she woke up with a stiff neck. That need not prevent you from
coming here. You have a stiff neck anyway! Then she has not turned up to
work the whole day, and her boyfriend has been saying that she is very
upset.</p><p>First you ask a question, without ever thinking that you are putting
me into a situation: either I have to lie just to console you, just to
inflate your ego... but that way I am not your friend; that way I am
your greatest enemy. That is what all the priests, all the religions,
all your leaders have been doing for thousands of</p><p>years, and I don't want to do it. But I can see why they were doing
it: you were very happy with them. They were giving you more and more
doses of opium to keep you fast asleep and consoled.</p><p>Because I have to say the truth, it is bound to hurt you, sometimes
very deeply. And I can understand; the pain that has been repressed
suddenly uncoils within you. But if rather than bringing understanding
it brings an upset, then it was better you had not asked the question.
You cannot expect from me that I am going to nourish your ego, protect
your wounds, console you in your misery, suffering, insincerity, helping
you to be a beautiful hypocrite.</p><p>She is again not here; I have looked around.… And it is not that she
is not hearing what I am saying; her room is just close by. She has
heard in the morning -- the stiff neck came later on -- and she is
hearing right now.</p><p>But you cannot understand my difficulty. If I don't care about you,
then I can simply say things which console you but don't transform you.
If I love you, then I have to be a surgeon and I have sometimes to
operate on you.</p><p>You laugh so beautifully when you hear of Zen masters hitting their
disciples, and if Veena goes on like this she will have unnecessarily
forced me to carry a staff too. I have never carried anything in my hand
in my whole life, but a friend has sent a beautiful staff, which is
waiting. Either Veena gets okay by tomorrow morning, or I will have to
use for the first time a very gross and primitive method.</p><p>I hit you as sophisticatedly as possible, as playfully as possible.
But if you are here not to be transformed, but are just hanging around
unconsciously, not even aware why you are here, not being aware of the
pilgrimage, then your being here or not being here is almost the same.
One thing you should remember: by your being upset you cannot change
me.</p><p>You can simply force me to use primitive methods that Zen masters
used. Please don't force me! And the only way is that whenever I say to
you... even if it hurts, my purpose is not to hurt you. When I hurt you
it is almost a necessity.</p><p>Vimal has shown immense understanding. He is not complaining that I
have touched his wound. That should be the attitude of everyone who has
come to be part of this caravan, who has accepted a totally new way
which has never existed before, and a totally new style of life, of
utter freedom and love.</p><p>But you have to be reminded continuously that even love is not just
simply a bed of roses.</p><p>And the more you love me, the more I am going to be hard with you.
The more you understand me, the more I can operate on you. You should
remember that all my sannyasins are just on the operating table
twenty-four hours a day. If you have a stiff neck, good; it will be
operated on!</p><p>Vimal, whatever your teacher said to you is almost a universal
problem. Teachers hurt their students, not out of love, not to help
them, but to feel a certain power.</p><p>There is a very beautiful historical incident in the life of one of
the great emperors of India. He had captured his own father, imprisoned
him, because the father was living too long. And he could not wait
anymore; he himself was getting old. By the time his father dies he will
not be able to live longer himself to dominate the whole kingdom. The
father has to be removed.</p><p>Politics knows nothing about love.</p><p>The father was imprisoned by his own son in jail. And strangely
enough, the next day the father simply sent a message, "There is no
problem; I have ruled enough. You need not have taken so much trouble to
arrest me. You could have simply said it to me. But now what has
happened has happened. I would just like you to send thirty students,
small boys, whom I can teach the holy KORAN" -- their religious
book.</p><p>When the message reached the court of his son, who had now become the
emperor of the whole of India... The son, despite being a ruthless,
violent, ugly man, still seems to have had tremendous insight into the
psychology of man -- and that is almost fifteen hundred years before
Sigmund Freud.</p><p>He said to the court, "Do you see this letter from my father? For
what does he want these thirty children? He cannot live without
dominating somebody, and the best way is to dominate small children
because they are so helpless."</p><p>After fifteen hundred years Sigmund Freud came to the same conclusion
-- he had no idea of this incident -- that the people who teach in the
schools, who choose the profession of teaching, somehow are people who
don't have the courage to go into politics but still want to dominate.
That is one thing to</p><p>remember about teachers. In my vision not everybody should be allowed
to be a teacher. It is one of the most fundamental things in life. Only
people who have a meditative understanding and no desire to dominate
should be allowed to be teachers. Then they will not hurt others, just
to feel powerful themselves.</p><p>I had graduated from the university, I had topped the whole
university. I simply went directly to the education minister and I told
him, "I need to be appointed as a professor in a certain
university."</p><p>He said, "You are strange. You should have applied."</p><p>I said, "Applications cannot represent me. I have come myself." But
he said, "You need qualifications."</p><p>I said, "I have all the qualifications that you need, and I have much
more." He said, "What is much more?"</p><p>I said, "Look into my eyes. I have no desire to dominate the way you
have the desire to dominate. I am not a politician. And just because I
don't have any desire to dominate, I am qualified to be a teacher."</p><p>He said, "Strange argument. No application, no certificates, no moral
certificates..."</p><p>I placed my certificates before him and I said, "These are the
certificates. But if you cannot see me, what will you be able to see in
these certificates? And I am saying to you that I simply qualify on a
ground which will be absolutely necessary in the future for every
teacher."</p><p>He looked into my certificates and he said to me, "Speak quietly!
There are clerks and typists and other departments by the side."</p><p>I said, "I don't care about anybody. You just give me the appointment
in the university I want; otherwise I am going to give a press
conference and you will be unnecessarily embarrassed, because as far as
educational qualifications are concerned they are amply fulfilled. What
more do you want than a man who has topped the whole university? What
more do you want than a man who has received as many marks as nobody
else before?</p><p>What do you want from a man who has this certificate from one of his
examiners?" It was just a letter written to me saying, "For my whole
life I have been waiting just to see something like the way you have
answered the questions. In my whole life I have never given the first
class award to anybody."</p><p>He was well known all over the country, particularly in this part,
because I think he belonged to Poona or nearby, Professor Ranade. He was
at that time the greatest professor of philosophy in India. In his
letter he said, "I wanted to give you one hundred percent marks, but I
hesitated because people may think that I am somehow favoring you.</p><p>So please forgive me, I am giving you only ninety-nine percent. And
the reason I am so impressed by your answers is that they are not from
the textbooks. It seems you have never read your textbooks; it seems
that you are the only person I have come across" --</p><p>and he was an old man, a retired professor -- "who has responded to
the questions spontaneously."</p><p>I said to the education minister, "What more do you want?"</p><p>He became so afraid when I told him about the press conference that
he immediately wrote the order. He said, "It will reach."</p><p>I said, "I want it to be given to me to take with me when I go
myself. What is the need to waste money in postage? You give it to
me."</p><p>And he became so freaked out! He said, "You don't understand the
bureaucratic way. It has to go through the post."</p><p>I said, "I don't want to support any bureaucracy. You give me the
order, and you can send another copy of the order through your
bureaucratic channel."</p><p>Just out of fear he gave it to me with trembling hands. I laughed
saying, "It is strange.</p><p>Are you taking my interview or am I taking your interview?"</p><p>And he was right. I reached before the order came through the mail,
and when I gave the order to the vice-chancellor of the university he
said, "But I have not</p><p>received anything."</p><p>I said, "This is the original. You will receive the true copy."</p><p>He said, "This is just absolutely absurd. The original has to come to
me." I said, "It has come."</p><p>He became afraid that there may be some trouble later on for him. He
immediately told me, "I have to phone to the education minister."</p><p>I said, "You can phone."</p><p>And he phoned. He said, "This is a strange case, unprecedented. The
order, the original order, has been brought by the person himself, and
he says the true copy is coming through the bureaucracy -- whenever it
comes it will come. What should I do?"</p><p>The education minister said, "Exactly what I have done! Simply do
what he says; otherwise, from the very first day you will be creating
trouble for yourself. So just do whatsoever he says. The true copy is
coming by the bureaucracy."</p><p>It came after seven days.</p><p>Teachers are psychologically attracted towards the profession for the
simple desire of dominating, insulting, humiliating -- not out of love,
not out of respect, not out of concern for your growth.</p><p>So it is good that you got your wound opened up. It has been created
in your school, where they were telling you that you were "slow, a bit
dim, not very intelligent and definitely needed to try harder." Now you
are saying, "And listening to you I had the feeling that maybe all this
was true. Is it?"</p><p>No. Something of it was true and something of it was not true. I will
have to separate the truth from the untruth.</p><p>You are not unintelligent, you are not dim; these statements are ugly
from any teacher towards any student. These are the statements which
make people dim and unintelligent, because repeated often in every
class, again and again, they become a kind of hypnosis.</p><p>They start believing in them. And once a person starts believing that
he is unintelligent, dim, he starts acting also in an unintelligent way,
because he has to prove the idea that he has been given.</p><p>But as far as your being slow is concerned, they were absolutely
right. You are slow, you are lazy. And your laziness is not bone lazy;
otherwise I will forgive it. You are just lazy by habit. Bone lazy is
someone who cannot help himself; from his very bones he is lazy.</p><p>I am bone lazy, so I know perfectly well what bone lazy means. I have
never done anything. How I have managed my life I sometimes wonder.
People have been doing so much, and still they cannot manage their
lives. It is just a miracle; I have simply not done anything.</p><p>One of my friends came from the Soviet Union to see me. He shook
hands and he told me, "You should never go to the Soviet Union."</p><p>I said, "Why?"</p><p>He said, "Your hands! Anybody shaking hands with you will immediately
say that you don't belong to the proletariat, you are a capitalist,
because you have never done anything</p><p>-- no sign on your hands that you have even carried a bucket of
water." And that's true!</p><p>You are in a far better position, Vimal. I cannot help it, so I have
not tried at all; I have simply relaxed in my laziness. People have
understood that if somebody is bone lazy and you love him, what to do?
-- prepare food for him, prepare clothes for him, prepare his bed,
prepare his bathroom, do everything.</p><p>You are just habitually lazy. You can drop it, you are more fortunate
than me. But that does not mean that you have to work harder. You have
just to understand that laziness is your habit, and to be enslaved by
any habit is against your own growth. I am not interested that you
should work more or less -- what does it matter? At least to me it
matters nothing whether anybody works or not.</p><p>This much is certain: that if for fifty-seven years I could manage
without moving from my bed, moving from my chair... that is the only
movement I do. I am the only man who enjoys freedom of movement -- no
obstacles, no problem.</p><p>But it will go against your own growth if you don't drop the habit.
And you have such a beautiful soul that it will be a great misfortune
not to attain to the ultimate illumination I have been talking about.
Your laziness may become a hindrance; it is just against your own
growth.</p><p>So you can think: if you want to remain the same, I have no
objection; if you want to grow, then just see that your laziness is not
something natural to you. You have learned it just by your teachers
telling you that you are unintelligent, you are dim. You accepted their
ideas -- and the natural effect of those ideas is laziness.</p><p>You are neither unintelligent nor dim. Drop that laziness which is
hanging around like darkness. By dropping it you will find your
intelligence becoming sharper, better, your understanding more clear,
more deep, your love gaining new flowers and new foliage.</p><p>A few sutras for you to contemplate, just lying down in your bed
underneath the blanket, in utter laziness.</p><p>A small town is one where there is no place to go that you should
not. The only thing which cannot be misquoted is silence.</p><p>No matter what goes wrong, there is always somebody who knew it
would. An optimist sees a doughnut -- a pessimist sees a hole.</p><p>The best way to succeed in the world is to find a crowd that is going
somewhere and get in front of them.</p><p>After man came woman, and she has been after him ever since.
Opposites attract -- like sloe gin and fast women.</p><p>You don't get it? Neither do I! I will also think over it, because my
understanding about gin or any other kind of alcoholic drugs is nil. I
thought you may understand it!</p><p>There is a crack in everything God has made.</p><p>Public opinion exists only where there are no ideas.</p><p>Whenever truth is injured, defend it. But if the truth goes against
you, accept it. It is better to be defeated than to reject the
truth.</p><p>A start is like a love affair... any fool can start it, but to end it
requires considerable skill.</p><p>So be alert! Before starting any love affair, be prepared how you
will end it. That is called homework.</p><p>An Englishman thinks seated, a Frenchman standing, an American
pacing, and an Irishman afterwards.</p><p>To keep an idea secret is to tell it to only one person at a time.
Old age is when it is harder to find temptation than to resist it. Old
men are not really old men, they are just twice boys.</p><p>If everything is coming your way, you are in the wrong lane.</p><p>A fool and his money are soon elected. Drop the old proverb which
used to say: A fool and his money are soon parted, that does not happen
anymore. A fool and his money are soon elected.</p><p>If the facts are against you, argue the law. If the law is against
you, argue the facts.</p><p>If the facts and the law are against you, shout like hell.</p><p>If worry makes you so nervous that your hand shakes, learn to play
the guitar.</p><p>The reason there are so few women after dinner speakers is because
few can wait that long.</p><p>A woman is able to forgive and forget, except she will never forget
what she forgave.</p><p>That is one of the mysteries of women.</p><p>If you have half a mind to watch TV, that's enough.</p><p>Vimal, just give it a try. I have nothing against laziness. It is not
a sin, it is not a crime; it is only a hindrance to your own spiritual
growth. But if you find it impossible and if you find that it is your
very nature, then relax in it, it is perfectly good. But first give it a
try, because my understanding is that bone lazy people are very rare in
the world, they cannot survive.</p><p>How have I survived? Later on when you start writing about me, make
it a miracle!</p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>NOTHING TO HOLD ON TO NOWHERE TO BELONG TO NOWHERE TO GO</p><p>BELOVED OSHO, WHY IS IT PAINFUL TO FEEL MY ALONENESS?</p><p>Dhyan Parijato, "Nothing to hold on to, nowhere to belong to, nowhere
to go -- why is it painful to feel my aloneness?"</p><p>What am I here for? For the time being hang around me, hold on to me.
Go with me wherever I am going. Belong to this caravan which is simply
enjoying, not going anywhere.</p><p>It is not the Jewish caravan that Moses was leading continuously for
forty years. And just now they have discovered the reason was they had
lost a quarter. They searched the whole Middle East -- it took forty
years, and still they could not get it!</p><p>This caravan is not searching for anything. This caravan is just
remaining herenow.</p><p>And I am allowing you to hold on to me, belong to me, just as a
device because</p><p>you are feeling so alone. Just the idea that you belong to me, that
you can hold on to me, that you go with me, and your painfulness and
your feeling of aloneness will disappear. Once it has disappeared you
will see that what I have given to you was only teddy bears just for the
time being; temporary arrangements to keep you alive to the point where
you can live in your aloneness, because aloneness is the most beautiful
space there is.</p><p>But you are in a deep misunderstanding. You are mixed up because of
the language and the dictionaries and the so-called learned people who
use the word àloneness'</p><p>synonymously with `loneliness'. Aloneness is experienced only at the
very height of consciousness, loneliness in the very dark ditches and
valleys. Loneliness is a desire to be with someone, and aloneness is the
joy of being oneself. They are not synonymous; they are absolutely
opposite.</p><p>If you are feeling painful, it is loneliness. So just for the time
being you need a few teddy bears. All through history those teddy bears
have been used. What is your God? --</p><p>nothing but a big teddy bear. What are all your theological systems?
-- just teddy bears made out of logical, rational argumentation, to help
you and to give you the sense that you are not lonely.</p><p>But they have all proved dangerous, because if you go on carrying
your teddy bear your whole life... It is okay up to a certain age. On
railway stations, on airports you will see little boys, little girls
carrying their teddy bears, which look absolutely Italian, so greasy, so
dirty. But without them they cannot live, they are absolutely lonely.
They sleep with them, they wake up with them, they go on carrying them
everywhere.</p><p>But a moment comes when they have grown up and they see that what
they have been carrying is just stupidity. Then the teddy bear remains
in the corner of the room for a few days, and then nobody knows where it
has gone. The corporation truck has taken it away.</p><p>So will go your God: the corporation truck will take it away with all
the rubbish.</p><p>You don't know anything, Dhyan Parijato, about what aloneness is.
Aloneness is that beautiful space where you feel yourself so contented
with yourself that you</p><p>don't need anybody else -- no God, no master, no friend, no
lover.</p><p>That does not mean that you cannot relate. You can relate with a
master, but for the first time the relatedness will be of a totally
different quality. You can relate in love, but your relatedness will not
become a relationship. You can have friends, but they will not be
filling any gap inside you. You are so full, there is no gap. You can
enjoy their company -</p><p>- and you will enjoy when they are gone even more, because they are a
kind of disturbance. Once in a while just for the change of taste you
can enjoy people. But mostly you will enjoy yourself.</p><p>I am reminded of one of Walt Whitman's most beautiful songs: "I
celebrate myself." You should look into that song and meditate upon it.
Unless the moment comes when you start celebrating yourself for no
reason at all, you have not known what religiousness is, you have not
known for what this whole existence exists, you have not known anything
of beauty, of truth, of divineness. Your life has been nothing but a
long, dark night of the soul.</p><p>Your meditation will help you to make the distinction between
aloneness and loneliness.</p><p>Your meditation will make you absolutely clear about the beauty and
the light and the blissfulness of aloneness. Then what is the need to
hold on to something? You are enough unto yourself. What is the need to
belong to someone or to something? You are complete, entire: the circle
has come to its completion. Nothing is missing, and what is the need to
go anywhere?</p><p>The most funny people in the world are the tourists, who are always
going somewhere for no reason at all. Whenever I see tourists, I have
such a hard time to keep myself silent.</p><p>They are such a temptation to laugh: carrying two cameras,
telescopes, thermos flasks, all kinds of junk and strange things; loaded
with all that and running from one place to another. And they do all
that running; they go on taking pictures!</p><p>Back at home, relaxed, they will see the album and will say, "My god,
what a beautiful Taj Mahal." And they could have purchased that
photograph in their own town without going anywhere else.</p><p>All this tourism has given them amoebas, all kinds of diseases. What
they think is beautiful, to me has always looked ugly. It has given them
a tan, it has destroyed their original color, just burned their skin.
But idiots are idiots. You can see them lying down -</p><p>- suffering, for a distortion of their faces, of their bodies -- on
all the beaches of the world.</p><p>If you want to know how many authentic idiots there are, you just go
on counting the number of people who are getting a tan on the sea
beaches, and you will come almost very close to the right number.
Whenever I see somebody with a tan I cannot practice what I preach. I
simply cannot like that stupid act that they have done. And they waste
so much money on it: there are tan oils and tan creams and tan powders,
and all the five-star hotels are full of these people. A strange kind of
mania -- tan mania!</p><p>There is nowhere to go.</p><p>Just meditate silently here and avoid these kinds of madnesses. They
go on spreading like wildfire, and just because others are doing it you
get caught into it.</p><p>Just meditation is enough for you.</p><p>Go in, and you will find all the answers for all your questions, and
more. Question 3</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>WHEN I FIRST CAME TO YOU, YOU TOLD ME TO MAKE WORK MY</p><p>MEDITATION AND TO STOP ALL FORMAL MEDITATIONS. EVER SINCE, I HAVE
BEEN GOING FOR IT... AND I LOVE IT!</p><p>LATELY I'VE BEEN WONDERING IF MAYBE I SHOULD SLOW DOWN. YOU</p><p>HAVE BEEN TALKING SO MUCH ABOUT MEDITATION. CAN WORK STILL BE</p><p>OUR MEDITATION? I LOVE WORKING, BUT I GET TEASED A LOT ABOUT</p><p>BEING A WORKAHOLIC.</p><p>Vedaprem, condensed to your very essentials the question means: I
should slow down talking about meditation. You are doing perfectly well
-- and you love it.</p><p>If people tease you and call you a workaholic, it is a compliment.
These people must be lazy people like Vimal! All the people here are
meditating, and if you are enjoying the meditation that I have given to
you -- that work is your meditation -- and you are enjoying it and you
love it, then why bother about others? Perhaps they are feeling jealous
of you. Perhaps they want to destroy your joy.</p><p>This is a strange world. Here anybody who succeeds in any sphere is
going to be teased, dragged down, bullied by the people saying, "You are
doing something wrong." And all that they want is that you should be a
part of the crowd of failures.</p><p>As far as I can see you are doing perfectly well. Perhaps I may have
done too much talking about meditation. I will try to slow down.</p><p>A traveling salesman was stuck in a small town and went to the only
available farmhouse for a place to sleep.</p><p>"Can you put me up for the night?" he asked the farmer.</p><p>"I guess I can," he answered, "if you don't mind sharing a room with
my young son."</p><p>"My God," said the salesman, "I'm in the wrong joke."</p><p>This is your situation; you are in a wrong crowd. But don't look
around at anybody; just concentrate, contemplate, meditate on your work.
Everything has to be poured into work.</p><p>Yes, be a workaholic.</p><p>Be utterly drunk with the joy of creativity.</p><p>I have not said it in vain, that work is your meditation. Apparently
I am bone lazy, but just apparently; otherwise, who is harassing you
all, day in, day out? By the time somehow you have got rested I am again
back in the morning to torture you for the whole day. By the time you
have slowed down a little -- I am back!</p><p>A young swami on his way to M.G. Road fell out of his rickshaw. And
as luck would have it, he landed in heaven.</p><p>After a few days' rest, he asked for some work. Finally he was given
a position in the</p><p>"Religious Statistics Department."</p><p>Here they had a clock for every religious leader on the earth, and
any sins committed by them would be recorded by a slight movement
forward.</p><p>The pope's clock had moved only two minutes in sixty-seven years.
Mother Teresa's only one minute, and so on.</p><p>The swami enquired to the angel in charge, "What about Osho's clock?"
"Oh," said the angel, "we use his as a desk fan!"</p><p>Just to avoid talking about meditation...</p><p>There was a German, a Frenchman and an Englishman staying with their
new brides at a famous honeymoon hotel. As they retired to bed they
agreed that they would get together the next day and exchange
experiences over some drinks.</p><p>The next day the German was asked, "How did you get on last
night?"</p><p>"Ach, vunce to begin wid, then vunce one hour later, und every time
the clock struck, vunce again, vich vass eight times in eight
hours."</p><p>"And what did your wife say?" "Wunderbar, wunderbar!!"</p><p>The Frenchman told them, "I am straight away on the work. Zen I am on
the work again when I get back my breath. Zen I sleep and start again,
and sleep and</p><p>start again, and sleep and start again, twenty times. Then I am
halted, finis." "What did your wife say?"</p><p>"Magnifique, encore, magnifique!!"</p><p>The Englishman had been very quiet. "Come tell us, how many?" "Once,"
he said.</p><p>"Once! -- what did your wife say at dawn?" "Get off, we need some
sleep."</p><p>I am in a difficulty -- how to avoid meditation? Only today I will
avoid, not tomorrow, because I don't want difficult tasks.</p><p>Just for your sake...</p><p>Devageet falls in love with an eighteen-year-old girl and they go off
to Goa for a honeymoon. When they get back, a friend says to him, "Do
tell me, how was it?"</p><p>"It was beautiful," says Devageet. "The sun, the sea... we made love
almost every night."</p><p>"Wait a minute," says his friend. "A man of your age -- how did you
manage that?"</p><p>"Well," says Devageet. "We almost made love on Monday, almost on
Tuesday..." Okay, Vimal?</p><p>Yes, Osho.</p><p>The Great Pilgrimage: From Here to Here Chapter #18</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part4>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

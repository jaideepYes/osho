But none of them has thought about the devil, which is a counterpart. They both exist together, just like light and darkness, life and death.\nBoth are hypothetical. God does not exist the way you exist and the trees exist and the mountains exist; it is just a hypothesis. And because of the hypothesis of God, theologians have had to create his other pole, the other polarity, the devil. So the devil becomes darkness and God becomes light.\nThe Hindu UPANISHADS have one of the most beautiful prayers, perhaps the most beautiful in the whole world of religion. I love its poetry, but I don't agree with its philosophy. The prayer is very small, but very pregnant with meaning and significance. It says, \"Lead me from darkness to light\" -- tamsoma jyotirgamaya. It says, \"Lead me from untruth to the truth\" -- astoma sadgamaya. And in the final stage it says, \"Lead me from death to life\" -- mrityorma amritamgamaya.\nIt is sheer poetry, you cannot improve upon it -- but it is utterly false, because darkness and light are one phenomenon. You cannot go from darkness to light, because light is nothing but a little less darkness, and darkness is nothing but a little less light. It is a difference of degrees. Neither can you go from untruth to truth -- the same differentiation of degrees is there. Every untruth has something true about it, and every truth expressed has to join hands with untruth.\nAnd you cannot go from death to eternal life, because death is part of life. It is not against it -- it is the very crescendo of life. They both exist together. A person who cannot die, cannot live either. Life exists with death almost like two wings of a bird: you cannot have the bird flying in the sky across the sun with one wing. Life and death are just like your two legs -- you cannot move with one leg.\nExistence is dialectical: it always has its opposite. Without the opposite, it will not exist.\nBecause man created God as the very holy of the holiest, he had to create a devil. It was just an absolute philosophical necessity! The devil is the counterpart of God. You will be surprised to know... your name is Deva Prachurya. Deva means divine, and devil also comes from the same root; it also means divine.\nBut both are hypothetical. I have no objection if God is a woman, but certainly I am immensely happy if the devil is a woman! God may be, may not be, but the devil is certainly a woman; otherwise for such a long eternity the devil could not have been nagging God continuously! From whom is God escaping? Where is he hiding, and from whom? Why has he not the guts to come out, at least once in a\nwhile, to remind people that he is still alive? The woman does not allow it.\nSo I am not certain about God, but, Deva Prachurya, woman is certainly a devil -\n- and vice-versa!\nMrs. Markovitz got a knock on the door.\n\"It is your husband,\" shouted her neighbor, \"he is face down in the swimming pool. I think he is drowned.\"\n\"Is today Wednesday?\" asked Mrs. Markovitz. \"Yes,\" said her neighbor, \"it is, but...\"\n\"What time is it?\" Mrs Markovitz asked. \"Eleven o'clock, but...\" replied her neighbor.\n\"Then don't worry about a thing,\" said Mrs. Markovitz, \"the pool man will be here in an hour!\"\nThe husband has drowned... but the wife and the husband are the greatest enemies in the world; psychologists call them \"intimate enemies.\" They have always been! It is a very recent development of insight.\nGod being a woman will create trouble. Then the devil will be a man -- because they have to be polar opposites. Perhaps the women's liberation movement has not thought about the implications of what they are doing. I would like God to be the man and tortured by the devil, the woman, rather than vice-versa, because good can be tortured by bad, but bad cannot be tortured by good. But the question simply has not come up around the world -- and women are insisting that God is a woman.\nIt is really strange that nobody has bothered about the devil, who is a more important person than God. God is only a VIP, the devil is a VVIP! God may have created the world, but the devil is running it -- and running it so devilishly and so perfectly.\nGenghis Khan, Tamerlane, Nadirshah, Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, Benito Mussolini, Ronald Reagan -- who do you think they represent? Certainly not\nGod! They represent the devil, and they have made our history. They are the people who go on creating more and more evil in the world.\nFriedrich Nietzsche has declared, \"God is dead and man is free.\" His statement is incomplete; he has forgotten about the devil. God may be dead -- most probably he cannot manage to survive the devil for so long -- but the devil is there. And unless the devil is also dead, man cannot be free.\nMan's real problem is not God; that poor fellow has never been seen after those first six days when he created the world. Since then nobody knows where he is -- whether he is sick, or got so tired of creating the world in six days that the seventh day he rested... that is allowed. But what happened on Monday? On office days you should be back. Since then he has been on holiday... it is an eternity. Most probably he died.\nBut the devil is still alive, and shows himself again and again. You cannot conceive of Adolf Hitler in any other way than an incarnation of the devil; you cannot think of Nadirshah and his great company, Tamerlane and Genghis Khan, as anything other than incarnations of the devil.\nI remember one case... Nadirshah attacked India -- and he was a man who enjoyed killing people so greatly that his whole life he was killing and killing. One night he asked his soldiers to bring the most beautiful woman of the area, so they brought a prostitute from a nearby village. In India, prostitutes are a little different than in the West. In the West they are only sex objects. In the East they are artists, dancers, singers; their being sex objects is secondary.\nShe danced, and Nadirshah was very happy. The night was almost coming to an end when Nadirshah said, \"Now I want to go to sleep, you can go back.\"\nHe gave immense rewards to the woman, but the woman said, \"It is dark outside. With so much money, so many diamonds... I am a woman and alone, and the path goes through a dark forest -- I cannot go.\"\nNadirshah told his soldiers, \"You go ahead of her, and go on burning everything that you find -- forest, village, anything. Make it a light.\"\nNobody has made light that way -- just a small torch would have done. But Nadirshah had such a devilish mind: he burned seven villages and the whole forest to make it almost look like day. He told the prostitute, \"Now you can go.\nAnd you will remember that you had come to see not some Tom, Dick, Harry; you had come to see the great emperor, Nadirshah. He can make the night into day.\" Thousands of villagers were burned alive.\nYou cannot say such a man represents God in any way.\nThe devil is spread all over your history; even today, the devil is ruling you. The devil is a politician, has always been a politician. God is a nice guy -- if he exists\n-- very gentlemanly, has remained almost anonymous, almost a nobody. If one has to think about who is more important, indubitably it is the devil.\nI would like him to be a woman, because the woman has many devilish qualities. But then God will have to be a man, because the polarity... both cannot be women, both cannot be men. If both were women, there would have been constant struggle and fight and jealousy and envy. If both were men, there would have been homosexuality and AIDS. So that is not acceptable; they have to be polar opposites.\nMy feeling is that the devil is man and God is woman -- at least he has been functioning as very womanly. The devil is very aggressive, and God goes on retreating.\nSo your question is very important theologically -- although in reality they both don't exist. Hypotheses cannot be male or female: two plus two is four -- do you think it is male or female? It is just neutral, it has no genital difference.\nGod and the devil are just theological hypotheses. It simply shows the weakness of the theologians that they could not manage the world without false hypotheses to support their systems. God they needed to create the world -- without ever bothering who created God. Their fundamental idea is that without somebody creating, nothing can be created; that's why they have accepted God as the creator of the world. But why stop with God?\nWhat happened to the original thesis?\nThe thesis was that nothing can be created without a creator. Who created God?\nAccording to all religions... the question has remained unanswered. They know that if they say God A was created by God B they will get into more trouble... then God C and God D, and the whole alphabet. Still, when they reach X,Y,Z,\nnothing will be solved -- who created God Z?\nIn fact they have started from a very wrong premise. Existence is intrinsically self-generated. It has always been here, so the question of creation does not arise. And it will always be here, so the question of destruction does not arise. It may pass through many phases of evolution, but it will remain.\nIf God can be dropped, there is no need for the devil. They are a married couple\n--\nbecause nobody has seen either of them, it is very difficult to say who is man and who is woman. But the devil seems to have been functioning around the world for centuries; after those six days, he has been in charge.\nMost probably, if you want hypotheses also to be divided as male and female, then he seems to be the male, because he has been working all along... and God must be a housewife -- that's why you don't see her any more in the marketplace. But the devil you will find anywhere. You don't have to look for him; he is looking for you!\nI am more interested that you get rid of both -- whoever they may be, male or female.\nGetting rid of both of them, existence becomes absolute freedom; man attains dignity and self respect.\nThe very idea of God and devil makes you either the slave of one or the slave of another.\nThe sinners are the servants of the devil, and the saints are the servants of God. But to be a servant, to be a slave, is against human dignity.\nHence I say unto you: God is dead, the devil is dead. Their death is very necessary for you to be alive. If they are alive, you are dead. Then you are imprisoned from both sides.\nThen man has to do a strange game continuously: he works for the devil, and worships God -- because you have to keep both of them happy.\nAn old man was dying and suddenly he started worshiping first God, repeating his name, and then the name of the devil. His family was aghast! They said, \"Are you mad? In the last moments of your life you are remembering the devil?\"\nHe said, \"I don't want to take any chance... who knows where I am going and whom I am going to meet? And it costs nothing, so I will remember both. Whoever meets me, I have remembered him, and if nobody meets me, there is no problem. If both meet me, then too there is no problem. I am calculating every possibility.\"\nMan is crushed between the devil and God, between good and evil. I want man not to be crushed, not to be enslaved, but to be an individual in his own right, free. And out of his freedom, and out of his awareness, he should act -- not according to what God wants.\nI have told you the story of the ten commandments. When God made the world, he went to the Babylonians and said, \"Would you like to have a commandment?\"\nThey said, \"First we would like to see what it is.\" And he said, \"Thou shalt not commit adultery.\"\nThe Babylonians said, \"What would we do? We don't want any commandment, please forgive us.\"\nHe went to the Egyptians, and he went to other races. Nobody was willing, because everybody asked, \"What is the commandment?\" And they said, \"We don't want to be encaged in any commandment. We want to live on our own.\"\nFinally he reached Moses and asked him, \"Do you want to have a commandment?\"\nMoses asked, \"How much does it cost?\"\nThis is a rare question! God had gone all around the world... and it was only Moses who asked the price, the first thing. God said, \"It costs nothing.\"\nMoses said, \"Then I will have ten!\" If it does not cost anything, why not have ten? --\nthat's how there are ten commandments.\nEvery religion has created its own commandments -- strange, unnatural -- out of fear or out of greed. But they have made this poor humanity that you see around the world.\nEven the richest man is so poor because he does not have the freedom to act according to his own consciousness. He has to act according to principles given by somebody else, and one does not know whether that man was a con-man, a fraud, a poet, a dreamer. There is no evidence... because so many people have claimed that they are incarnations of God, that they are messengers of God, that they are prophets of God, and they all bring different messages. Either God is mad or these people are simply lying. Nost probably they are lying...!\nIt gives you a great egoistic feeling if you are a prophet, a messiah, an avatara, a tirthankara -- somebody special, not just an ordinary human being. Then you can dominate. This is a different kind of politics. Wherever there is domination, there is politics.\nThe politician is dominating because of physical force -- his armies, his armaments, his nuclear weapons. The religious prophets, messiahs, saviors, avataras are dominating you spiritually. Their domination is more dangerous -- they are far greater politicians. They are dominating your life not only from outside but from inside. They have become your inside, they have become your morality, they have become your conscience, they have become your very spiritual being.\nFrom inside they go on dominating you, saying what is right, what is wrong. You have to follow them, otherwise you start feeling guilty, and guilt is one of the greatest spiritual diseases. If you follow them, you start feeling unnatural, neurotic, perverted, because you are not following your nature. If you follow your nature, you are not following your prophets and your saviors.\nAll these religions have created for man a situation in which he cannot be at ease, he cannot enjoy life, he cannot live it in its totality. So my suggestion is, it is better to let both guys be dead. And what does it matter? -- when one is dead, whether he is man or woman does not matter. A dead woman is not dangerous, neither is a dead man. They are not alive.\nLet humanity be free from all these old superstitions which have dominated so\nbadly, and distorted human nature so immensely. You can see the humanity that is the result. You say that a tree is known by its fruits. If that is true -- and that is true -- then your whole past of prophets, saviors, avataras, tirthankaras, God, devil, should be judged by the humanity that you find today.\nThis insane humanity -- miserable, suffering, full of anger, rage, hate... If this is the result of all your religions, of all your leaders -- whether political or religious\n-- then it is better to let God and the devil die. With God and the devil gone, political leaders and religious leaders will not have any support; they will be the next to die.\nI want man to be politically free, religiously free, free in every dimension to function out of his own still small voice, out of his own consciousness. And that will be a beautiful world, a real revolution.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nI FEEL SO BLESSED TO HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO FLOAT IN YOUR\nOCEAN OF SILENCE. DOES MY WANTING MORE BLOCK MY AVAILABILITY\nTO RECEIVE IT?\nAnand Saten, I am sorry to say to you that your wanting more is certainly going to block your availability to receive the bliss that you are receiving without expectations. This is a simple, basic rule.\nJesus says, \"Ask and it shall be given to you.\" I say, \"Don't ask, otherwise it will be not given to you; not only that, whatever is given to you will be taken away.\" Jesus says,\n\"Knock and the doors shall be opened,\" and I say unto you, \"Knock, and even if the doors are open, they will be locked!\"\nJesus says, \"Seek and ye shall find,\" and I say unto you, \"Seek, and you have missed forever. Don't seek, and you are it -- there is nothing else to find.\"\nThe bliss that you are finding here is not coming from outside; it has been within you always -- you just have never been in the company of blissful, madly divine people.\nSeeing so many people flowering, suddenly you have blossomed.\nBlissfulness is contagious. That's my whole idea of creating small oases around the world, where people can find blissful people all around. The very presence of those blissful people will transform them. Intrinsically everyone has the capacity, but they are always surrounded by miserable people so they never become aware that there is a possibility of being blissful. Everybody is miserable and it looks a little weird and awkward and embarrassing: when everybody is miserable and you are enjoying, one feels guilty. You have to be part of the company you have chosen.\nThe whole world can be blissful because everybody carries it within himself. But there are a few points to be remembered, and the most important is: don't ask for it, don't knock for it, don't seek it, don't expect it -- otherwise you will become closed. Remain available and open, and it comes... and it comes in abundance.\nPaddy drove through the red light and smashed into a car driven by Father O'Hagan. The car turned over three times and the priest was thrown from the vehicle into the gutter.\nPaddy rushed over and said, \"I am terribly sorry, Father\". \"Saints above!\" said the shaken priest, \"You almost killed me.\"\n\"Here,\" said Paddy, \"I have got a small bottle of whisky. Take some and you will feel a lot better.\"\nFather O'Hagan took a couple of large gulps and then continued his tirade: \"What were you doing? You nearly launched me into eternity.\"\n\"I am sorry, Father,\" said Paddy. \"Take a few more sips and it will ease your nerves.\"\nThe priest took another large gulp and almost finished the bottle, which he offered to Paddy saying, \"Why don't you have a drink?\"\n\"No thanks, Father,\" said Paddy, \"I will just sit here and wait for the police to arrive!\"\nJust be a little alert, that's all! If you can learn only one lesson, that of being conscious, blissfulness will arrive. And it is natural -- I can understand -- when it comes, you want more. But you have to be alert not to want more. On the contrary, be thankful for that which has come, and more will be coming -- that is absolutely certain. I say it on my own experience, not according to any scripture, or according to any religion, or according to any saint.\nDon't expect! Whatever you get, be grateful for it. Instead of expecting more say, \"This is too much! I don't deserve it, I have not earned it.\" Bow down to existence in deep gratitude, and you will feel flowers of bliss and benediction showering on you from all sides.\nOnce you have learned the simple rule, you will never expect -- and you will always be getting more and more. Just remain available, keep the doors and windows of your heart open.\nQuestion 3 BELOVED OSHO,\nFOR A FEW DAYS MY HEART HAS BEEN JUMPING ALL AROUND THE\nASHRAM AND IT FEELS LIKE I AM LOSING CONTROL. BELOVED MASTER, HOW FAR CAN I GO?\nNirgrantha, you have already gone too far if your heart is jumping all around the ashram!\nAnd you are still saying, \"It feels like I am losing control.\" You have lost control long ago; otherwise how can your heart go on jumping all around the ashram?\nYou forget all about control. This place is not for people who control; this place is for people who let their heart dance wherever it wants to dance!\nRemember a famous proverb: Talent is what you possess, genius is what possesses you.\nYou cannot control genius; you can control talents. Here we are creating the possibility for your sleeping genius to be awake. Once your genius is awake, you are going to be possessed, you will not be in control -- and there is no need to be in control. The sky is vast, millions of stars are moving without crashing, and no traffic control! Here I see thousands of hearts dancing, running -- no traffic control! Nature manages itself so perfectly that if you don't disturb, everything goes alright -- and very smoothly.\nA man dressed as Adolf Hitler visited a psychiatrist. \"You can see I have no problems,\"\nhe said. \"I have the greatest army in the world, all the money I ever need and every conceivable luxury you can imagine.\"\n\"Then what seems to be the trouble?\" asked the doctor.\n\"It is my wife,\" said the man, \"she thinks she is Mrs. Jones.\"\nSo just remember one thing: you can be dancing all around joyously, just don't get caught up with a wife, otherwise she will control you! You have lost control -\n- and here in my place there are great women controllers! The moment they see that some fellow is getting out of control, they immediately control. So avoid a wife. Once in a while you can dance with any woman, but remain free.\nControl is not my message; control is repression. Nirgrantha... I have given you the name Nirgrantha; do you understand its meaning? One who is absolutely free\n-- without any complexes, without any chains, without any bondage. And you are asking me about control...?\nI had explained to you when I gave you the name to drop all chains, drop all bondages.\nJust be yourself and do whatsoever pleases you. Just remember one thing: don't interfere into anybody's life, and don't allow anybody else to interfere in your life. This is true humanity -- authentic, honest, pure.\nIt was a rough ocean crossing, and Mr. Levensky was suffering the tortures of sea-sickness. During one of the more unsettled periods, he was leaning over the rail retching miserably, when a kindly steward patted him on the shoulder. \"I know sir,\" said the steward, \"that it seems awful, but remember -- no man ever\ndied of sea-sickness.\"\nMr. Levensky lifted his green face to the steward and said, \"For heaven's sake man, don't say that. It is the wonderful hope of dying that is keeping me alive!\"\nIt is a very strange life!\n\"Be careful,\" the doctor told the relatives of an elderly man who was dying.\nOne by one they went up to him, \"You look so much brighter today,\" exclaimed his daughter.\n\"You must be on the mend,\" said his son.\n\"I have not seen you look so healthy for years,\" said his wife.\nThe old chap opened his eyes and said, \"Thank you for your kind words; it is good to know that I am going to die cured!\"\nNirgrantha, rather than dying cured, why not live cured?\nYou are cured if your heart is jumping -- I have never heard of any dead man's heart jumping all around the ashram. We have three enlightened dead men in the ashram. This day is in their memory, and even on this day, they are not here! Dead men, even if they want to jump, cannot jump. So while you are alive, enjoy it to its fullest. Don't be worried about being tired or anything, because finally in your grave you will have enough rest!\nLive a life of immense intensity and totality so that in your grave you don't toss and turn, because there is not much space! Don't miss this moment in thinking about control. In graveyards you can think about all these great things, and nobody will prevent you. You can keep control, you will have to keep control! You can follow all ten commandments, you will have to follow -- how can you commit adultery in a grave?\nBefore that, it is good to live as joyously and as freely as possible, because who knows when you will be coming back to this beautiful earth, to these beautiful people? Even today you will not find a gathering of such beautiful people.\nThis is my only crime: I am condemned all over the world for simply one reason,\nthat I am making people live totally and intensely, not bothering about their commandments, not bothering about their holy scriptures, not bothering about their gods and their devils, their heaven and their hell.\nAll those things are to be thought about and contemplated in your grave. You will have enough time, almost the whole of eternity. So lie down there and be philosophical, be moral, don't commit any sin. But right now, don't be bothered about all these superstitions.\nOnly one thing has to be remembered, and that is to be as conscious as possible, because that will make you dance rightly, in right places, with right people! Your consciousness will not allow you to jump on somebody else's toes. That is the only sin.\nAccording to me, to interfere in somebody's life is the only sin, and the only virtue is not to interfere in anybody's life. Let him be himself, and let you be yourself... your freedom.\nThis is, according to me, the authentic religiousness. This is the only holy pilgrimage:\nFrom here to here -- you don't have to go anywhere.\nFrom now to now -- you don't have to travel in time or space.\nNirgrantha, you are in a good spirit; don't lose the track of it. Control is an old habit which every child is being taught from the very childhood: control -- control everything -\n- discipline, behave.\nNow you are no more a child, and I am not your father -- I am not even your uncle!\nThrow all control, throw all licenses, throw all boundaries. Life is so short, don't destroy it in controls and boundaries and mannerisms and etiquette and all kinds of nonsense.\nRejoice! I repeat, rejoice -- and rejoice totally. And if your heart is dancing, give\nit full energy. Everybody's heart is dancing. This is a place of dance, of song, of laughter. And I say this is the only kaaba, the only holy place in the world today. All holy places have become unholy, they have become prisons for man in the name of morality, control, discipline.\nThis is a small place with a vast territory of independence, freedom. The whole sky is yours -- even the sky is not the limit.\nOkay, Vimal? Yes, Osho.\nThe Great Pilgrimage: From Here to Here Chapter #5\nChapter title: You have never looked inside\n8 September 1987 pm in Gautam the Buddha Auditorium Archive\ncode: 8709085\nShortTitle: PILGR05\nAudio: Yes Video: Yes Length: 86\nmins Question 1\nBELOVED OSHO,\nGIVE ME SOME SUTRAS TO MEDITATE ON.\nDevageet... Devageet is a dental doctor, but lately he is turning into a philosopher! Just today he has sent a telegram to Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, saying \"Drop the idea of saving the world through transcendental meditation. I have a better suggestion.…\" His suggestion is `transdental medication'! And I think that if the world can be saved by yogic hopping, then there seems to be no problem why it cannot be saved by transdental medication.\nHe is asking for some sutras to meditate on, but sutras are serious, and meditation does not need any sutra. Meditation is a state where absolute emptiness exists, not even a sutra; there is not any possibility of any object. A philosopher never meditates, a philosopher contemplates. So I can give sutras for contemplation, but not for meditation because that will be absolutely wrong.\nMeditation simply means silence -- absolute, unconditional serenity of the heart, of the mind, of the being... no stirring of any kind. Even a sutra is enough of a disturbance. You can contemplate on a sutra; sutra is Sanskrit for maxim.\nThe first... a successful man: one who earns more than his wife can spend. And second, a successful woman: one who finds such a man!\nThird: A jealous man always finds more than he is looking for.\nFifth: Some minds are like concrete -- mixed-up and permanently set.\nSixth: The first half of life consists of the capacity to enjoy without the chance. The last half consists of the chance without the capacity.\nSeventh: What Poona really needs is a vegetarian mosquito.\nEighth: The man who admits he is wrong is wise. The man who gives in when he is right is married!\nNinth: The rich get richer and the poor get children.\nTenth: Middle age is when it takes longer to rest than to get tired.\nEleventh: You never know how many friends you have until you rent a cottage in Poona.\nTwelfth: You can't tell how deep a puddle is until you step in it. Thirteenth: Virtue is its own punishment.\nFourteenth: By the time a man is wise enough to watch his step, he is too old to go anywhere.\nFifteenth: Prayer must never be answered. If it is, it ceases to be prayer and becomes a correspondence.\nFifteenth: An asylum for the sane would be empty in this world. You don't get it! You belong to this world!\nSixteenth: It is always the best policy to speak the truth unless you are, of course, an exceptionally good liar.\nSeventeenth: He who does not mind a big belly will hardly mind anything else.\nDevageet, contemplate as much as you can, but it will not lead you anywhere. Anything that can bring you some light, some conclusion, is not contemplation, it is meditation.\nIt has been an old fallacy that meditation also needs an object to meditate upon. The very word `meditation' is wrong because it gives the idea that you have to meditate upon something. Meditation simply means that you don't have anything left to meditate upon.\nAll is empty: there is no object, no chanting, no mantra, no sutra... just pure emptiness.\nAnd suddenly all your energy of awareness turns upon yourself, without any effort on your part.\nAnd the turning of the energy of awareness upon yourself is the ultimate experience of life, of light, of everything that is really valuable;everything that cannot be purchased but can be attained, everything that is not a commodity anybody else can give you but is something that you already have -- but you have never looked inside.\nLooking inside is meditation -- just pure looking inwards, a turning of the eyes inwards one hundred and eighty degrees, and you have arrived home. Not a single step has to be taken, because you are not going anywhere; you are simply coming from here to here.\nYou are already there where you need to be, just you are not aware. Hence, meditation can be called awareness, watchfulness, alertness, witnessing -- but it is not thinking.\nContemplation is thinking; it will not lead you anywhere.\nNo philosopher has reached to any conclusion that solves the ultimate question of life, Who am I? But you are not to think about it... what will you think about it?\nThere are many people who have followed Maharishi Raman. His teaching was very simple -- he was a simple man, uneducated, not learned. He had escaped from his home when he was only seventeen. He escaped because his father died. When the whole family was weeping and crying, and the neighbors were preparing to take the dead body to the funeral pyre, nobody noticed that Raman had disappeared.\nThe experience of the death of his father became a tremendous revolution in Raman's mind. He was only seventeen, the only son of a poor family, and he escaped to the mountains. He remained his whole life on the mountain of Arunachal where he did nothing but just sit and watch inside. He never asked anybody anything. He had no master, he had nobody to guide him, but just sitting silently watching his own mind, he transcended his mind and he came to know himself.\nAnd by knowing himself he came to know the ultimate bliss -- the ecstasy that surrounded Gautam Buddha, the enlightenment that was radiating from Mahavira, the joy, the dance of all those who have awakened. So whoever was asking him, \"What are we supposed to do?\" he had only one answer his whole\nlife: \"Meditate on `Who am I?'\"\nBut people have misunderstood him... even such a simple statement. He was not saying,\n\"Contemplate,\" he was not saying, \"Think about `Who am I?'\" -- what can you think?\nEither you know or you don't know; thinking is impossible. What will you think? If you start you will think, \"This is my name, this is my country, this is my family, this is my race, this is my caste, this is my profession.…\" But what will you find by doing this? You will not find out who you are. These things are all on the periphery.\nBut Raman was not a master in the sense that he could explain to people that watching the mind, the whole process of the mind, the whole traffic of thoughts... Even \"Who am I?\" is a thought; don't get stuck to it. Just watch that thought too, and a moment comes when all thinking disappears -- just by watching. Just as you bring light into a dark room and darkness disappears, as you bring watchfulness to your mind, mind disappears.\nAnd the disappearance of the mind is the beginning of knowing yourself.\nThis is the highest peak of consciousness, and unless a man achieves it, he has wasted his life in trivia. He lived only in name; in fact he vegetated. He may have been a very rich vegetable... They say there are only two kinds of vegetables, cabbage and cauliflower; the cabbage category is uneducated, and the cauliflower is a cabbage with college degrees.\nBut there is not much difference.\nIf you really want to live and not to vegetate, meditation is the only way; and meditation means no-mind... just silence.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nYOU HAVE SPOKEN TO US ABOUT BEING IN THE WORLD YET NOT OF IT.\nHOW COME YOU HAVE NOT SPOKEN TO US ABOUT BEING IN THE COMMUNE YET NOT OF IT?\nDeva Shravan, I have spoken about being in the world but not of it. A commune is not a community, a commune is not a world, a commune is not a society. A commune is a very friendly gathering of people who live in the world but are not of the world.\nA commune is not an organization, it is simply the gathering of individuals. It does not take away anybody's individuality. It does not destroy your dignity, your pride, your self-respect. On the contrary, it gives you dignity, respect, love: it accepts you as you are. It does not demand that you should be somebody else, then only will you be thought worthy; it does not ask you to be a saint. It simply loves you as you are. That's why in the commune there is no question at all...\nHow can I say to you, \"Be in the commune but don't belong to it\"? The commune is basically individuals who have learned to be in the world and not of the world. That statement is true about the world, because the world tries to strangle you, the world tries to make you a prisoner in a thousand and one ways. The commune gives you total freedom to be yourself; there is no question of belonging to it. Each individual exists as an individual, not as a part of the commune.\nIn the larger world each individual is only a cog in the wheel, he does not exist as himself. He is only a number, just like in the armies. A soldier dies... on the board of the office appears the notice that \"number sixteen has died.\" In the army names are not recognized, but only numbers.\nYou will be surprised what the psychology is behind it; there is tremendous meaning. If your name is recognized, then you have a wife, you have children, you have old parents, an old father, an old mother, who must be waiting for you, who must be praying that you come back home alive. If you have a name, you are irreplaceable; but if you are just a number -- number sixteen...\nNumbers don't have wives, they don't have children, they don't have parents -- nobody is waiting for them. In fact numbers can be replaced, but names cannot be, individuals cannot be. Hence for centuries armies have been changing people into numbers. So when somebody looks at the board -- how many numbers have died -- he does not feel anything about their wives, their children, their father,\ntheir mother, their friends, all their hopes, all their prayers It is a very cunning\nstrategy to deceive people. And these numbers can be immediately replaced by other numbers; somebody else will become number sixteen. There is no problem in replacing numbers.\nSociety also, in a more subtle way, makes you just a part; it never allows you total freedom to be yourself. You are a husband, you are a wife, you are a father, you are a brother... you are never yourself, you are somebody else. There are a thousand and one expectations from you to be fulfilled; those are your chains. There are responsibilities and duties; those are your prisons.\nIn a commune you don't have a duty, you don't have a responsibility. You don't have to be somebody else to be worthy, to be respected, to be prestigious. Just as you are, in your utter nudeness, you are accepted, loved. Your very being is enough, nothing more is needed.\nYou don't ask a roseflower to be somebody else, and you don't ask a lotus to be somebody else. A marigold is as beautiful as the rose. The world would be poorer if there were no marigolds, and only roses. The world is richer because more variety is there.\nEach individual in a commune is unique; in the world he is just a carbon copy. In the commune, everybody is original; in the world, only a true copy.\nThe world expects you to follow, imitate -- everything others are doing you should do.\nThe commune does not ask anything of you; you should simply do what is spontaneous to you, what you feel like doing. You should allow yourself absolute freedom for your potential to blossom. Hence I have not talked about the other part of your question, because that will be against the very idea of the commune.\nA commune is not an alternative society.\nA commune is a brotherhood of rebellious souls.\nBernie was more than a little annoyed when a neighbor telephoned at 3:OO a.m. and complained, \"Your dog is barking so loudly that I can't sleep!\" The neighbor hung up before he could reply.\nThe following morning at 3:OO a.m. Bernie called his neighbor and said, \"I don't have a dog!\"\nThis is your world -- utterly insane! That's why I say that unfortunately you have to be in it. Be, but don't belong to it; keep yourself as much unimpressed, uninfluenced by others as possible. Keep your originality; don't lose it in the crowd.\nThe young bride was inconsolable, in spite of the fact that her dead, seventy- five-year-old husband had left her ten million dollars in his will. Her friends tried to make her understand: \"You are so young,\" they said. \"You have a great life ahead, and ten million dollars! He had to die sooner or later.\"\n\"You don't understand,\" she sobbed. \"He was the greatest lover. We lived next door to the church and he used to make love to me by the sound of the church bells -- ding-dong, ding-dong. And he would be alive today if it wasn't for that damn fire truck!\"\nThat's why I say: Don't belong to this world. Be in it, but be alert that you don't get lost in the madness that is all over the earth.\nOld man Finkelstein, aged eighty-five, went to a sperm bank to make a deposit. The young woman at the reception was skeptical. \"Are you sure that you want to do this?\" she asked.\n\"Yes,\" said old Finkelstein. \"I feel it is my duty to give something from myself to the world.\"\nThe woman gave him a jar and directed him to a room down the hall. When thirty minutes had passed and he did not return, the girl began to worry that he might have had a heart attack. But just then the old man came out of the room and approached the woman.\n\"Listen,\" he said, \"I tried it with one hand, then I tried it with two hands, then I got it up and hit it on the sink, then I ran warm water on it, then cold water over it, and I still can't get the lid of the jar open!\"\nIt is better not to be part of this insane world! Remain sane. Insanity is normal in the world -- that's why you don't detect it. Once you understand that it is the normal insanity, and you start looking deeply into it, you will be immensely\nsurprised that you are living in a big madhouse.\nThe commune is a rebellion, it is not a revolution. A revolution creates an alternative society. For example, what happened in the Soviet Union was a revolution; it created an alternative society. But that society is as insane as any other society; perhaps it has different names for its insanity, but nothing has changed.\nSeventy years after the revolution, people are standing in queues just to get bread\n-- even today. Seventy years ago they revolted against the czar to make a new world where nobody will be poor, but what actually happened is that they have created a world where nobody is rich. They have brought equality to the world, that's certainly true: they have made everybody equally poor. People in the Soviet Union, which is one sixth of the whole world, are living in a concentration camp.\nI have been in America, and my sannyasins in the Soviet Union are trying for me to enter into the Soviet Union some day. Today they must have gathered to celebrate -- they have informed me that they will be gathering at the same time as we are. They have to gather in basements. They have to read books silently, \"underground,\" so nobody can hear.\nThe KGB, the Intelligence Department, has caught hold of twenty sannyasins and has interrogated them continuously for weeks, harassed them just because they had my books. They have taken away all their books, and they were trying to force them to tell who the other sannyasins are. And because they were not telling, they were harassed continuously in the middle of the night; they would be called to the police station and the whole night continuous interrogation... and this is revolution!\nMan has become even more a slave than he was ever before. Man was not such a slave even in the days of the czar before the revolution; society was not so dominant and so afraid of people and their freedom.\nAmerica makes claims of democracy. I lived there for five years, and there is no democracy at all. It is one of the most hypocritical societies; it is deceiving the whole world in the name of democracy. It is another kind of dictatorship. But the whole world is like this.…\nI have been refused entry by twenty-one countries. Even before I had applied for\na tourist visa, the German parliament decided and ordered all the borders and all the airports that if I try to enter into the country from anywhere I am not allowed... not only that I am not allowed in the country, my airplane has not to be allowed to land at any airport.\nWhat kind of world have we made?\nI have not done any harm to those people. I have never been in their country. And what harm can I do if my airplane just lands for refueling in their international airport? -- and why do you call it an international airport? In what way can I affect their morality, their religion, their tradition?\nI was never aware that people can be so afraid of rational thinking, of intelligent behavior. I had never thought that the whole world lives under different kinds of superstitions. They are so afraid that somebody may create an upheaval -- at least in the younger generation -- by making them aware of their superstitions.\nBut to live under superstitions is to live blindly. That's why I say: don't belong to this world. This is not the world for human beings, this is not the world for intelligent people; this is an ugly world created by millions of years of superstition and darkness, exploited by the religious leaders, politicians and so- called moralists. They have all proved to be parasites -- and nothing else.\nA commune is not an alternative society. A commune is simply a brotherhood without any organization, without any hierarchy. Nobody is your religious leader and nobody is your political leader. Everybody is simply allowed to be his natural self, without any judgment and without any evaluation.\nQuestion 3 BELOVED OSHO,\nI FOUND OUT THAT MY TWO BASIC INTERESTS ARE SEX AND MEDITATION.\nAM I DOING RIGHT? I WANT TO BE YOUR FAVORITE DISCIPLE. WHAT TO\nDO? WHICH IS THE WORST QUESTION TO ASK YOU?\nChaitanya, you have asked it! You say your interests are two: sex and meditation. If sex is your interest, forget all about meditation. When you get tired of sex, fed up with it, then the same energy that was involved in sex can be used for meditation. But you can't have both together -- that will be like riding on two horses together. Either you have sex, or you have meditation.\nBut one thing you have to understand: you cannot have meditation unless you have transcended sex. But transcendence should not be understood in the old ways as repression. Transcendence is experience, so much experience that you don't think anymore about attraction, infatuation.\nSex simply drops like dry leaves from the trees.\nIt is not that you have to make some effort. If you have to make some effort to drop it, it will remain with you. And if it is there, meditation is impossible; it won't let you be silent. It is one of the most torturous biological slaveries. It is good to get rid of it by experiencing it with totality and intensity -- don't think of meditation at all. Sex, lived totally, will bring you to meditation; and then meditation will be very easy, because there will be no biological pull against it. Your so-called priests, monks, saints, cannot meditate.\nEven a man like Mahatma Gandhi, at the age of seventy, was having sexual dreams. This was the result of a whole life of repression. And finally at the age of seventy-five he started to sleep with young naked girls.\nHis disciples, who had become the rulers of the country -- he was the greatest spiritual and political leader, both -- tried to hide this fact; the masses of the country should not know about it. They protected him in every way. The news should not become common; people should not come to know about it. There was a danger that he might lose all his saintliness. People have respected him, followed him... and before his death, he will see himself fallen, failed.\nThey tried to persuade him to stop this, but he had his explanations and excuses. He used to tell them, \"This is an experiment to check on my celibacy -- whether I am really celibate or not.\"\nMind is very cunning. Nobody in the world has ever checked celibacy this way before. If you are celibate, I don't think you will not know whether you are or not, whether the idea of the other sex comes to your mind or not. You don't need any test. You yourself will be enough to know whether your mind is visited by\nsexual ideas, dreams, fantasies, or not.\nBut the reality was he was tortured... and the reason was not that he was insincere; he was a very sincere man, but he followed a wrong path sincerely. Always remember: just sincerity is not going to help. You can be very honest, very sincere, very arduous... but if you are on a wrong path all your sincerity will lead you not to the goal you wanted to reach, but exactly to its opposite.\nGandhi could never understand what meditation is, and that was one of his greatest failures. He could not understand that you can be free from any desire only if you have lived it completely, entirely. If something has remained unlived it is going to haunt you.\nChaitanya, you are saying sex and meditation are your two basic interests. Please have one basic interest! And sex is absolutely first, because that is your biological bondage.\nYou have to get free of it, and the way to get free of it is not to fight with it -- that's what religious people have been doing for centuries. They have not succeeded.\nNot a single person has succeeded in transcending sex by fighting it, by repressing it.\nLive it! -- and don't live it with guilt, don't live it as if it is something wrong, it is a sin. It is not. It is neither a sin nor a crime, it is an absolutely natural way of reproducing. You are not responsible for it.\nYou are produced through sex. Your every cell is sexual. Nature has found a way to go on reproducing life in new forms; sex is simply a methodology which nature has chosen.\nYou cannot fight with nature. Nature is vast and tremendously strong, but you can get beyond it, and the way beyond is through it -- not by fighting, but by understanding, experiencing.… And the more you become experienced, capable of understanding, it is absolutely easy to move your energy into the second stage of evolution: from sex to meditation.\nMeditation is very simple if sex has been lived completely without any fear, any repression, any guilt. My own understanding is that by the time... just as at the\nage of fourteen you become interested in sex, if you live perfectly and totally and sincerely --\nreligiously -- your sexual life, by the age of forty-two you will be out of it.\nLife has seven year cycles. If you take as an average seventy years, it has ten cycles of seven years. The first seven years you are absolutely innocent -- you are just as a saint should be. Your second seven years are a preparation for sex; slowly, slowly, the snake of sex starts uncoiling within you. By the age of fourteen you are mature and you can reproduce children. From fourteen to twenty-one your sexual energy is at its highest peak, exactly between fourteen and twenty-one: that means seventeen and a half is the climax of sexual energy.\nBut this society has lived with such repressive and unnatural, unscientific ideas that these are the years when you are told to be celibate. And these are the years when you could have lived sex, and celibacy would have come by itself by the time you are forty-two.\nBetween twenty-one and twenty-eight, sex is very normal, very natural. From twenty-eight to thirty-five, sex starts declining. From thirty-five to forty-two, sex reaches its ultimate decline. From forty-two to forty-nine, sex disappears. That's why in ancient India the wise people decided that by the time one is fifty-one should start preparing for vanprashtha. His face should be now towards the mountains, towards the forest -- that is the meaning of vanprashtha. He is still in the world, but now his whole consciousness has turned and he is getting ready to move into the deep forest to be alone. The days of meditation have come.\nBy the time a person is fifty his children will be nearabout twenty-five. They must be getting married, they must be getting into a profession. The father can look forward to twenty-five years more... these are the twenty-five years, from fifty to seventy-five, that he can watch -- he can live in the world yet not be of the world. He can watch his children slowly taking over. And after seventy-five all his interest in the world will have disappeared; then meditation will be his only interest.\nBut this is just a formal categorization. It depends on you and your intensity of living.\nYou can be beyond sex by the time you are thirty-five. You can be beyond sex without much difficulty when you are forty-two. But it is unfortunate that people\ndie still as foolish as young people.\nPsychologists have come to the conclusion that most people die with the idea of sex...\nthat is their last idea. They may be repeating the name of God, but inside they are thinking, If only it was possible one time more...! They have not lived their life wholeheartedly. That's why something that should have ended at forty-two has continued up to eighty, up to ninety.\nChaitanya, live your first interest and be finished with it. But be finished with it by living it, joyously! There is nothing wrong, there is no sin. Then meditation will become absolutely simple and easy, because your mind will not be burdened with sexual infatuation and desires. That is your only bondage. All other bondages are secondary, all other bondages are branches of your sexuality.\nFor what do you want money? For what do you want power? Have you watched that all other interests are centered on sex? A man without money will not be able to get the most beautiful woman; a man without power will not be able to get the most beautiful woman.\nAll your so-called desires are centered on a single fact, a single interest, and that is sex.\nJust live it, and live it joyously without any fear of hell or heaven. There is no hell, no heaven.\nOnce you are out of sex, once it has disappeared like smoke disappearing into the sky and you cannot see it, then meditation is so easy. You don't have to make any effort, you have just to sit silently with your eyes closed, relaxed, and you will find meditation is there.\nSex and meditation...? You will not be able to live sex fully, and that will go on lingering with you. And you will not be able to meditate because sex will continuously interfere.\nYou know the stories of the old seers, that even at their height, in their old age, after a long, long preparation of austerities, fasting, chanting, studying holy scriptures -- doing everything -- when they come to the point of realization, the stories say that suddenly apsaras from heaven... Apsaras are nothing but\nheavenly prostitutes, specially provided for the saints. They are sent down to disturb these poor fellows' meditation.\nThis is strange, why should anybody be bothered about these poor fellows who have been torturing themselves in every possible way -- starving, fighting with their body, repressing their sex? There is nobody who is sending these apsaras, and these apsaras are nowhere. It is just their own repressed sexuality that starts coming up in fantasies, in hallucinations.\nAnd it is so simple... if you want to experiment with what hallucination is, just go to a mountain cave alone, fast three weeks, and don't meet anyone. By the end of the second week you will start talking to yourself -- and not only will you talk, you will answer also!\nBy the third week you will start seeing people... if you are a man you will see women; if you are a woman you will see men. By the fourth week you will not be able to make a distinction at all whether the woman that you see sitting in front of you in the cave is real or an hallucination...!\nJust four weeks' experiment and you will know how apsaras have come. They will come to you too;they have not stopped the process of coming. But it is simply the hallucination of your repressed desire, so deeply repressed that it takes revenge -- with a vengeance.\nMy suggestion to you is, first sex, because it is more basic to your body, to your life; it is the foundation of life. Meditation is the highest peak, but sex is the roots. First think of the roots.\nMeditation is the flowers. They come at the very end, at the very top of the tree; they will come. But don't try both together, otherwise you will remain wishy- washy, always halfhearted... meditating and thinking about sex, making love and thinking about Gautam Buddha! This will simply drive you crazy.\nAnd you are asking, \"I want to be your favorite disciple.\"\nI feel scared! Please just remain a disciple! I don't have any favorite disciples, because to have favorite disciples means people who will betray you, people who will become Judases, people who will assassinate you. People who are first trying to be favorite disciples soon would like you to move over, give place to them; now they want to be masters. I don't want any favorite disciples. This is\nsimple politics. Just keep to the space where you are. I am feeling perfectly at ease; when you come too close... I am allergic!\nAnd you are saying, \"What to do? Which is the worst question to ask you?\" You cannot ask it. What worse question can you ask? You have asked it. But I can answer you, as bad as you like! Just I am looking for a worse...! So just be patient! It is really the worst, so just be quiet.\nAn English lady was on holiday in the wild west. One day she decided to visit an Indian reservation and became interested in the number of feathers in the men's headdresses. So she asked one brave, and he replied, \"Me only have one feather because me only have one squaw.\"\nThinking this was a joke, she asked another brave. \"Me only have four feathers because me only have four squaws,\" he replied.\nSomewhat perturbed, the English lady decided to ask the chief, who had a magnificent headdress full of feathers. \"Me Chief,\" he replied, \"so me fuck them all! Big, small, short, tall... me fuck them all!\"\nThe lady was horrified. \"You ought to be hung!\" she cried. \"You damned right,\" said the Chief, \"me hung like a buffalo!\" The English lady cried, \"You don't have to be so hostile!\" \"Hoss-style, dog-style, any style... me fuck them all!\"\nWith tears in her eyes, the lady cried, \"Oh, dear \"\n\"No deer,\" said the Chief, \"Deer run too fast and asshole too high!\" Okay, Vimal?\nYes, Osho.\nThe Great Pilgrimage: From Here to Here Chapter #6\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"10256","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_great_pilgrimage_from_here_to_here/part2/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_great_pilgrimage_from_here_to_here/>The Great Pilgrimage From Here to Here</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: Suddenly you have blossomed</h1><div class=post-meta>49 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;10256 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Great_Pilgrimage_From_Here_to_Here/part2.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part1>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

liberation movement is talking about God being a woman; they have
started pronouncing him not he but she. But none of them has thought
about the devil, which is a counterpart. They both exist together, just
like light and darkness, life and death.</p><p>Both are hypothetical. God does not exist the way you exist and the
trees exist and the mountains exist; it is just a hypothesis. And
because of the hypothesis of God, theologians have had to create his
other pole, the other polarity, the devil. So the devil becomes darkness
and God becomes light.</p><p>The Hindu UPANISHADS have one of the most beautiful prayers, perhaps
the most beautiful in the whole world of religion. I love its poetry,
but I don't agree with its philosophy. The prayer is very small, but
very pregnant with meaning and significance. It says, "Lead me from
darkness to light" -- tamsoma jyotirgamaya. It says, "Lead me from
untruth to the truth" -- astoma sadgamaya. And in the final stage it
says, "Lead me from death to life" -- mrityorma amritamgamaya.</p><p>It is sheer poetry, you cannot improve upon it -- but it is utterly
false, because darkness and light are one phenomenon. You cannot go from
darkness to light, because light is nothing but a little less darkness,
and darkness is nothing but a little less light. It is a difference of
degrees. Neither can you go from untruth to truth -- the same
differentiation of degrees is there. Every untruth has something true
about it, and every truth expressed has to join hands with untruth.</p><p>And you cannot go from death to eternal life, because death is part
of life. It is not against it -- it is the very crescendo of life. They
both exist together. A person who cannot die, cannot live either. Life
exists with death almost like two wings of a bird: you cannot have the
bird flying in the sky across the sun with one wing. Life and death are
just like your two legs -- you cannot move with one leg.</p><p>Existence is dialectical: it always has its opposite. Without the
opposite, it will not exist.</p><p>Because man created God as the very holy of the holiest, he had to
create a devil. It was just an absolute philosophical necessity! The
devil is the counterpart of God. You will be surprised to know... your
name is Deva Prachurya. Deva means divine, and devil also comes from the
same root; it also means divine.</p><p>But both are hypothetical. I have no objection if God is a woman, but
certainly I am immensely happy if the devil is a woman! God may be, may
not be, but the devil is certainly a woman; otherwise for such a long
eternity the devil could not have been nagging God continuously! From
whom is God escaping? Where is he hiding, and from whom? Why has he not
the guts to come out, at least once in a</p><p>while, to remind people that he is still alive? The woman does not
allow it.</p><p>So I am not certain about God, but, Deva Prachurya, woman is
certainly a devil -</p><p>- and vice-versa!</p><p>Mrs. Markovitz got a knock on the door.</p><p>"It is your husband," shouted her neighbor, "he is face down in the
swimming pool. I think he is drowned."</p><p>"Is today Wednesday?" asked Mrs. Markovitz. "Yes," said her neighbor,
"it is, but..."</p><p>"What time is it?" Mrs Markovitz asked. "Eleven o'clock, but..."
replied her neighbor.</p><p>"Then don't worry about a thing," said Mrs. Markovitz, "the pool man
will be here in an hour!"</p><p>The husband has drowned... but the wife and the husband are the
greatest enemies in the world; psychologists call them "intimate
enemies." They have always been! It is a very recent development of
insight.</p><p>God being a woman will create trouble. Then the devil will be a man
-- because they have to be polar opposites. Perhaps the women's
liberation movement has not thought about the implications of what they
are doing. I would like God to be the man and tortured by the devil, the
woman, rather than vice-versa, because good can be tortured by bad, but
bad cannot be tortured by good. But the question simply has not come up
around the world -- and women are insisting that God is a woman.</p><p>It is really strange that nobody has bothered about the devil, who is
a more important person than God. God is only a VIP, the devil is a
VVIP! God may have created the world, but the devil is running it -- and
running it so devilishly and so perfectly.</p><p>Genghis Khan, Tamerlane, Nadirshah, Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin,
Benito Mussolini, Ronald Reagan -- who do you think they represent?
Certainly not</p><p>God! They represent the devil, and they have made our history. They
are the people who go on creating more and more evil in the world.</p><p>Friedrich Nietzsche has declared, "God is dead and man is free." His
statement is incomplete; he has forgotten about the devil. God may be
dead -- most probably he cannot manage to survive the devil for so long
-- but the devil is there. And unless the devil is also dead, man cannot
be free.</p><p>Man's real problem is not God; that poor fellow has never been seen
after those first six days when he created the world. Since then nobody
knows where he is -- whether he is sick, or got so tired of creating the
world in six days that the seventh day he rested... that is allowed. But
what happened on Monday? On office days you should be back. Since then
he has been on holiday... it is an eternity. Most probably he died.</p><p>But the devil is still alive, and shows himself again and again. You
cannot conceive of Adolf Hitler in any other way than an incarnation of
the devil; you cannot think of Nadirshah and his great company,
Tamerlane and Genghis Khan, as anything other than incarnations of the
devil.</p><p>I remember one case... Nadirshah attacked India -- and he was a man
who enjoyed killing people so greatly that his whole life he was killing
and killing. One night he asked his soldiers to bring the most beautiful
woman of the area, so they brought a prostitute from a nearby village.
In India, prostitutes are a little different than in the West. In the
West they are only sex objects. In the East they are artists, dancers,
singers; their being sex objects is secondary.</p><p>She danced, and Nadirshah was very happy. The night was almost coming
to an end when Nadirshah said, "Now I want to go to sleep, you can go
back."</p><p>He gave immense rewards to the woman, but the woman said, "It is dark
outside. With so much money, so many diamonds... I am a woman and alone,
and the path goes through a dark forest -- I cannot go."</p><p>Nadirshah told his soldiers, "You go ahead of her, and go on burning
everything that you find -- forest, village, anything. Make it a
light."</p><p>Nobody has made light that way -- just a small torch would have done.
But Nadirshah had such a devilish mind: he burned seven villages and the
whole forest to make it almost look like day. He told the prostitute,
"Now you can go.</p><p>And you will remember that you had come to see not some Tom, Dick,
Harry; you had come to see the great emperor, Nadirshah. He can make the
night into day." Thousands of villagers were burned alive.</p><p>You cannot say such a man represents God in any way.</p><p>The devil is spread all over your history; even today, the devil is
ruling you. The devil is a politician, has always been a politician. God
is a nice guy -- if he exists</p><p>-- very gentlemanly, has remained almost anonymous, almost a nobody.
If one has to think about who is more important, indubitably it is the
devil.</p><p>I would like him to be a woman, because the woman has many devilish
qualities. But then God will have to be a man, because the polarity...
both cannot be women, both cannot be men. If both were women, there
would have been constant struggle and fight and jealousy and envy. If
both were men, there would have been homosexuality and AIDS. So that is
not acceptable; they have to be polar opposites.</p><p>My feeling is that the devil is man and God is woman -- at least he
has been functioning as very womanly. The devil is very aggressive, and
God goes on retreating.</p><p>So your question is very important theologically -- although in
reality they both don't exist. Hypotheses cannot be male or female: two
plus two is four -- do you think it is male or female? It is just
neutral, it has no genital difference.</p><p>God and the devil are just theological hypotheses. It simply shows
the weakness of the theologians that they could not manage the world
without false hypotheses to support their systems. God they needed to
create the world -- without ever bothering who created God. Their
fundamental idea is that without somebody creating, nothing can be
created; that's why they have accepted God as the creator of the world.
But why stop with God?</p><p>What happened to the original thesis?</p><p>The thesis was that nothing can be created without a creator. Who
created God?</p><p>According to all religions... the question has remained unanswered.
They know that if they say God A was created by God B they will get into
more trouble... then God C and God D, and the whole alphabet. Still,
when they reach X,Y,Z,</p><p>nothing will be solved -- who created God Z?</p><p>In fact they have started from a very wrong premise. Existence is
intrinsically self-generated. It has always been here, so the question
of creation does not arise. And it will always be here, so the question
of destruction does not arise. It may pass through many phases of
evolution, but it will remain.</p><p>If God can be dropped, there is no need for the devil. They are a
married couple</p><p>--</p><p>because nobody has seen either of them, it is very difficult to say
who is man and who is woman. But the devil seems to have been
functioning around the world for centuries; after those six days, he has
been in charge.</p><p>Most probably, if you want hypotheses also to be divided as male and
female, then he seems to be the male, because he has been working all
along... and God must be a housewife -- that's why you don't see her any
more in the marketplace. But the devil you will find anywhere. You don't
have to look for him; he is looking for you!</p><p>I am more interested that you get rid of both -- whoever they may be,
male or female.</p><p>Getting rid of both of them, existence becomes absolute freedom; man
attains dignity and self respect.</p><p>The very idea of God and devil makes you either the slave of one or
the slave of another.</p><p>The sinners are the servants of the devil, and the saints are the
servants of God. But to be a servant, to be a slave, is against human
dignity.</p><p>Hence I say unto you: God is dead, the devil is dead. Their death is
very necessary for you to be alive. If they are alive, you are dead.
Then you are imprisoned from both sides.</p><p>Then man has to do a strange game continuously: he works for the
devil, and worships God -- because you have to keep both of them
happy.</p><p>An old man was dying and suddenly he started worshiping first God,
repeating his name, and then the name of the devil. His family was
aghast! They said, "Are you mad? In the last moments of your life you
are remembering the devil?"</p><p>He said, "I don't want to take any chance... who knows where I am
going and whom I am going to meet? And it costs nothing, so I will
remember both. Whoever meets me, I have remembered him, and if nobody
meets me, there is no problem. If both meet me, then too there is no
problem. I am calculating every possibility."</p><p>Man is crushed between the devil and God, between good and evil. I
want man not to be crushed, not to be enslaved, but to be an individual
in his own right, free. And out of his freedom, and out of his
awareness, he should act -- not according to what God wants.</p><p>I have told you the story of the ten commandments. When God made the
world, he went to the Babylonians and said, "Would you like to have a
commandment?"</p><p>They said, "First we would like to see what it is." And he said,
"Thou shalt not commit adultery."</p><p>The Babylonians said, "What would we do? We don't want any
commandment, please forgive us."</p><p>He went to the Egyptians, and he went to other races. Nobody was
willing, because everybody asked, "What is the commandment?" And they
said, "We don't want to be encaged in any commandment. We want to live
on our own."</p><p>Finally he reached Moses and asked him, "Do you want to have a
commandment?"</p><p>Moses asked, "How much does it cost?"</p><p>This is a rare question! God had gone all around the world... and it
was only Moses who asked the price, the first thing. God said, "It costs
nothing."</p><p>Moses said, "Then I will have ten!" If it does not cost anything, why
not have ten? --</p><p>that's how there are ten commandments.</p><p>Every religion has created its own commandments -- strange, unnatural
-- out of fear or out of greed. But they have made this poor humanity
that you see around the world.</p><p>Even the richest man is so poor because he does not have the freedom
to act according to his own consciousness. He has to act according to
principles given by somebody else, and one does not know whether that
man was a con-man, a fraud, a poet, a dreamer. There is no evidence...
because so many people have claimed that they are incarnations of God,
that they are messengers of God, that they are prophets of God, and they
all bring different messages. Either God is mad or these people are
simply lying. Nost probably they are lying...!</p><p>It gives you a great egoistic feeling if you are a prophet, a
messiah, an avatara, a tirthankara -- somebody special, not just an
ordinary human being. Then you can dominate. This is a different kind of
politics. Wherever there is domination, there is politics.</p><p>The politician is dominating because of physical force -- his armies,
his armaments, his nuclear weapons. The religious prophets, messiahs,
saviors, avataras are dominating you spiritually. Their domination is
more dangerous -- they are far greater politicians. They are dominating
your life not only from outside but from inside. They have become your
inside, they have become your morality, they have become your
conscience, they have become your very spiritual being.</p><p>From inside they go on dominating you, saying what is right, what is
wrong. You have to follow them, otherwise you start feeling guilty, and
guilt is one of the greatest spiritual diseases. If you follow them, you
start feeling unnatural, neurotic, perverted, because you are not
following your nature. If you follow your nature, you are not following
your prophets and your saviors.</p><p>All these religions have created for man a situation in which he
cannot be at ease, he cannot enjoy life, he cannot live it in its
totality. So my suggestion is, it is better to let both guys be dead.
And what does it matter? -- when one is dead, whether he is man or woman
does not matter. A dead woman is not dangerous, neither is a dead man.
They are not alive.</p><p>Let humanity be free from all these old superstitions which have
dominated so</p><p>badly, and distorted human nature so immensely. You can see the
humanity that is the result. You say that a tree is known by its fruits.
If that is true -- and that is true -- then your whole past of prophets,
saviors, avataras, tirthankaras, God, devil, should be judged by the
humanity that you find today.</p><p>This insane humanity -- miserable, suffering, full of anger, rage,
hate... If this is the result of all your religions, of all your leaders
-- whether political or religious</p><p>-- then it is better to let God and the devil die. With God and the
devil gone, political leaders and religious leaders will not have any
support; they will be the next to die.</p><p>I want man to be politically free, religiously free, free in every
dimension to function out of his own still small voice, out of his own
consciousness. And that will be a beautiful world, a real
revolution.</p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>I FEEL SO BLESSED TO HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO FLOAT IN YOUR</p><p>OCEAN OF SILENCE. DOES MY WANTING MORE BLOCK MY AVAILABILITY</p><p>TO RECEIVE IT?</p><p>Anand Saten, I am sorry to say to you that your wanting more is
certainly going to block your availability to receive the bliss that you
are receiving without expectations. This is a simple, basic rule.</p><p>Jesus says, "Ask and it shall be given to you." I say, "Don't ask,
otherwise it will be not given to you; not only that, whatever is given
to you will be taken away." Jesus says,</p><p>"Knock and the doors shall be opened," and I say unto you, "Knock,
and even if the doors are open, they will be locked!"</p><p>Jesus says, "Seek and ye shall find," and I say unto you, "Seek, and
you have missed forever. Don't seek, and you are it -- there is nothing
else to find."</p><p>The bliss that you are finding here is not coming from outside; it
has been within you always -- you just have never been in the company of
blissful, madly divine people.</p><p>Seeing so many people flowering, suddenly you have blossomed.</p><p>Blissfulness is contagious. That's my whole idea of creating small
oases around the world, where people can find blissful people all
around. The very presence of those blissful people will transform them.
Intrinsically everyone has the capacity, but they are always surrounded
by miserable people so they never become aware that there is a
possibility of being blissful. Everybody is miserable and it looks a
little weird and awkward and embarrassing: when everybody is miserable
and you are enjoying, one feels guilty. You have to be part of the
company you have chosen.</p><p>The whole world can be blissful because everybody carries it within
himself. But there are a few points to be remembered, and the most
important is: don't ask for it, don't knock for it, don't seek it, don't
expect it -- otherwise you will become closed. Remain available and
open, and it comes... and it comes in abundance.</p><p>Paddy drove through the red light and smashed into a car driven by
Father O'Hagan. The car turned over three times and the priest was
thrown from the vehicle into the gutter.</p><p>Paddy rushed over and said, "I am terribly sorry, Father". "Saints
above!" said the shaken priest, "You almost killed me."</p><p>"Here," said Paddy, "I have got a small bottle of whisky. Take some
and you will feel a lot better."</p><p>Father O'Hagan took a couple of large gulps and then continued his
tirade: "What were you doing? You nearly launched me into eternity."</p><p>"I am sorry, Father," said Paddy. "Take a few more sips and it will
ease your nerves."</p><p>The priest took another large gulp and almost finished the bottle,
which he offered to Paddy saying, "Why don't you have a drink?"</p><p>"No thanks, Father," said Paddy, "I will just sit here and wait for
the police to arrive!"</p><p>Just be a little alert, that's all! If you can learn only one lesson,
that of being conscious, blissfulness will arrive. And it is natural --
I can understand -- when it comes, you want more. But you have to be
alert not to want more. On the contrary, be thankful for that which has
come, and more will be coming -- that is absolutely certain. I say it on
my own experience, not according to any scripture, or according to any
religion, or according to any saint.</p><p>Don't expect! Whatever you get, be grateful for it. Instead of
expecting more say, "This is too much! I don't deserve it, I have not
earned it." Bow down to existence in deep gratitude, and you will feel
flowers of bliss and benediction showering on you from all sides.</p><p>Once you have learned the simple rule, you will never expect -- and
you will always be getting more and more. Just remain available, keep
the doors and windows of your heart open.</p><p>Question 3 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>FOR A FEW DAYS MY HEART HAS BEEN JUMPING ALL AROUND THE</p><p>ASHRAM AND IT FEELS LIKE I AM LOSING CONTROL. BELOVED MASTER, HOW FAR
CAN I GO?</p><p>Nirgrantha, you have already gone too far if your heart is jumping
all around the ashram!</p><p>And you are still saying, "It feels like I am losing control." You
have lost control long ago; otherwise how can your heart go on jumping
all around the ashram?</p><p>You forget all about control. This place is not for people who
control; this place is for people who let their heart dance wherever it
wants to dance!</p><p>Remember a famous proverb: Talent is what you possess, genius is what
possesses you.</p><p>You cannot control genius; you can control talents. Here we are
creating the possibility for your sleeping genius to be awake. Once your
genius is awake, you are going to be possessed, you will not be in
control -- and there is no need to be in control. The sky is vast,
millions of stars are moving without crashing, and no traffic control!
Here I see thousands of hearts dancing, running -- no traffic control!
Nature manages itself so perfectly that if you don't disturb, everything
goes alright -- and very smoothly.</p><p>A man dressed as Adolf Hitler visited a psychiatrist. "You can see I
have no problems,"</p><p>he said. "I have the greatest army in the world, all the money I ever
need and every conceivable luxury you can imagine."</p><p>"Then what seems to be the trouble?" asked the doctor.</p><p>"It is my wife," said the man, "she thinks she is Mrs. Jones."</p><p>So just remember one thing: you can be dancing all around joyously,
just don't get caught up with a wife, otherwise she will control you!
You have lost control -</p><p>- and here in my place there are great women controllers! The moment
they see that some fellow is getting out of control, they immediately
control. So avoid a wife. Once in a while you can dance with any woman,
but remain free.</p><p>Control is not my message; control is repression. Nirgrantha... I
have given you the name Nirgrantha; do you understand its meaning? One
who is absolutely free</p><p>-- without any complexes, without any chains, without any bondage.
And you are asking me about control...?</p><p>I had explained to you when I gave you the name to drop all chains,
drop all bondages.</p><p>Just be yourself and do whatsoever pleases you. Just remember one
thing: don't interfere into anybody's life, and don't allow anybody else
to interfere in your life. This is true humanity -- authentic, honest,
pure.</p><p>It was a rough ocean crossing, and Mr. Levensky was suffering the
tortures of sea-sickness. During one of the more unsettled periods, he
was leaning over the rail retching miserably, when a kindly steward
patted him on the shoulder. "I know sir," said the steward, "that it
seems awful, but remember -- no man ever</p><p>died of sea-sickness."</p><p>Mr. Levensky lifted his green face to the steward and said, "For
heaven's sake man, don't say that. It is the wonderful hope of dying
that is keeping me alive!"</p><p>It is a very strange life!</p><p>"Be careful," the doctor told the relatives of an elderly man who was
dying.</p><p>One by one they went up to him, "You look so much brighter today,"
exclaimed his daughter.</p><p>"You must be on the mend," said his son.</p><p>"I have not seen you look so healthy for years," said his wife.</p><p>The old chap opened his eyes and said, "Thank you for your kind
words; it is good to know that I am going to die cured!"</p><p>Nirgrantha, rather than dying cured, why not live cured?</p><p>You are cured if your heart is jumping -- I have never heard of any
dead man's heart jumping all around the ashram. We have three
enlightened dead men in the ashram. This day is in their memory, and
even on this day, they are not here! Dead men, even if they want to
jump, cannot jump. So while you are alive, enjoy it to its fullest.
Don't be worried about being tired or anything, because finally in your
grave you will have enough rest!</p><p>Live a life of immense intensity and totality so that in your grave
you don't toss and turn, because there is not much space! Don't miss
this moment in thinking about control. In graveyards you can think about
all these great things, and nobody will prevent you. You can keep
control, you will have to keep control! You can follow all ten
commandments, you will have to follow -- how can you commit adultery in
a grave?</p><p>Before that, it is good to live as joyously and as freely as
possible, because who knows when you will be coming back to this
beautiful earth, to these beautiful people? Even today you will not find
a gathering of such beautiful people.</p><p>This is my only crime: I am condemned all over the world for simply
one reason,</p><p>that I am making people live totally and intensely, not bothering
about their commandments, not bothering about their holy scriptures, not
bothering about their gods and their devils, their heaven and their
hell.</p><p>All those things are to be thought about and contemplated in your
grave. You will have enough time, almost the whole of eternity. So lie
down there and be philosophical, be moral, don't commit any sin. But
right now, don't be bothered about all these superstitions.</p><p>Only one thing has to be remembered, and that is to be as conscious
as possible, because that will make you dance rightly, in right places,
with right people! Your consciousness will not allow you to jump on
somebody else's toes. That is the only sin.</p><p>According to me, to interfere in somebody's life is the only sin, and
the only virtue is not to interfere in anybody's life. Let him be
himself, and let you be yourself... your freedom.</p><p>This is, according to me, the authentic religiousness. This is the
only holy pilgrimage:</p><p>From here to here -- you don't have to go anywhere.</p><p>From now to now -- you don't have to travel in time or space.</p><p>Nirgrantha, you are in a good spirit; don't lose the track of it.
Control is an old habit which every child is being taught from the very
childhood: control -- control everything -</p><p>- discipline, behave.</p><p>Now you are no more a child, and I am not your father -- I am not
even your uncle!</p><p>Throw all control, throw all licenses, throw all boundaries. Life is
so short, don't destroy it in controls and boundaries and mannerisms and
etiquette and all kinds of nonsense.</p><p>Rejoice! I repeat, rejoice -- and rejoice totally. And if your heart
is dancing, give</p><p>it full energy. Everybody's heart is dancing. This is a place of
dance, of song, of laughter. And I say this is the only kaaba, the only
holy place in the world today. All holy places have become unholy, they
have become prisons for man in the name of morality, control,
discipline.</p><p>This is a small place with a vast territory of independence, freedom.
The whole sky is yours -- even the sky is not the limit.</p><p>Okay, Vimal? Yes, Osho.</p><p>The Great Pilgrimage: From Here to Here Chapter #5</p><p>Chapter title: You have never looked inside</p><p>8 September 1987 pm in Gautam the Buddha Auditorium Archive</p><p>code: 8709085</p><p>ShortTitle: PILGR05</p><p>Audio: Yes Video: Yes Length: 86</p><p>mins Question 1</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>GIVE ME SOME SUTRAS TO MEDITATE ON.</p><p>Devageet... Devageet is a dental doctor, but lately he is turning
into a philosopher! Just today he has sent a telegram to Maharishi
Mahesh Yogi, saying "Drop the idea of saving the world through
transcendental meditation. I have a better suggestion.…" His suggestion
is `transdental medication'! And I think that if the world can be saved
by yogic hopping, then there seems to be no problem why it cannot be
saved by transdental medication.</p><p>He is asking for some sutras to meditate on, but sutras are serious,
and meditation does not need any sutra. Meditation is a state where
absolute emptiness exists, not even a sutra; there is not any
possibility of any object. A philosopher never meditates, a philosopher
contemplates. So I can give sutras for contemplation, but not for
meditation because that will be absolutely wrong.</p><p>Meditation simply means silence -- absolute, unconditional serenity
of the heart, of the mind, of the being... no stirring of any kind. Even
a sutra is enough of a disturbance. You can contemplate on a sutra;
sutra is Sanskrit for maxim.</p><p>The first... a successful man: one who earns more than his wife can
spend. And second, a successful woman: one who finds such a man!</p><p>Third: A jealous man always finds more than he is looking for.</p><p>Fifth: Some minds are like concrete -- mixed-up and permanently
set.</p><p>Sixth: The first half of life consists of the capacity to enjoy
without the chance. The last half consists of the chance without the
capacity.</p><p>Seventh: What Poona really needs is a vegetarian mosquito.</p><p>Eighth: The man who admits he is wrong is wise. The man who gives in
when he is right is married!</p><p>Ninth: The rich get richer and the poor get children.</p><p>Tenth: Middle age is when it takes longer to rest than to get
tired.</p><p>Eleventh: You never know how many friends you have until you rent a
cottage in Poona.</p><p>Twelfth: You can't tell how deep a puddle is until you step in it.
Thirteenth: Virtue is its own punishment.</p><p>Fourteenth: By the time a man is wise enough to watch his step, he is
too old to go anywhere.</p><p>Fifteenth: Prayer must never be answered. If it is, it ceases to be
prayer and becomes a correspondence.</p><p>Fifteenth: An asylum for the sane would be empty in this world. You
don't get it! You belong to this world!</p><p>Sixteenth: It is always the best policy to speak the truth unless you
are, of course, an exceptionally good liar.</p><p>Seventeenth: He who does not mind a big belly will hardly mind
anything else.</p><p>Devageet, contemplate as much as you can, but it will not lead you
anywhere. Anything that can bring you some light, some conclusion, is
not contemplation, it is meditation.</p><p>It has been an old fallacy that meditation also needs an object to
meditate upon. The very word `meditation' is wrong because it gives the
idea that you have to meditate upon something. Meditation simply means
that you don't have anything left to meditate upon.</p><p>All is empty: there is no object, no chanting, no mantra, no sutra...
just pure emptiness.</p><p>And suddenly all your energy of awareness turns upon yourself,
without any effort on your part.</p><p>And the turning of the energy of awareness upon yourself is the
ultimate experience of life, of light, of everything that is really
valuable;everything that cannot be purchased but can be attained,
everything that is not a commodity anybody else can give you but is
something that you already have -- but you have never looked inside.</p><p>Looking inside is meditation -- just pure looking inwards, a turning
of the eyes inwards one hundred and eighty degrees, and you have arrived
home. Not a single step has to be taken, because you are not going
anywhere; you are simply coming from here to here.</p><p>You are already there where you need to be, just you are not aware.
Hence, meditation can be called awareness, watchfulness, alertness,
witnessing -- but it is not thinking.</p><p>Contemplation is thinking; it will not lead you anywhere.</p><p>No philosopher has reached to any conclusion that solves the ultimate
question of life, Who am I? But you are not to think about it... what
will you think about it?</p><p>There are many people who have followed Maharishi Raman. His teaching
was very simple -- he was a simple man, uneducated, not learned. He had
escaped from his home when he was only seventeen. He escaped because his
father died. When the whole family was weeping and crying, and the
neighbors were preparing to take the dead body to the funeral pyre,
nobody noticed that Raman had disappeared.</p><p>The experience of the death of his father became a tremendous
revolution in Raman's mind. He was only seventeen, the only son of a
poor family, and he escaped to the mountains. He remained his whole life
on the mountain of Arunachal where he did nothing but just sit and watch
inside. He never asked anybody anything. He had no master, he had nobody
to guide him, but just sitting silently watching his own mind, he
transcended his mind and he came to know himself.</p><p>And by knowing himself he came to know the ultimate bliss -- the
ecstasy that surrounded Gautam Buddha, the enlightenment that was
radiating from Mahavira, the joy, the dance of all those who have
awakened. So whoever was asking him, "What are we supposed to do?" he
had only one answer his whole</p><p>life: "Meditate on `Who am I?'"</p><p>But people have misunderstood him... even such a simple statement. He
was not saying,</p><p>"Contemplate," he was not saying, "Think about `Who am I?'" -- what
can you think?</p><p>Either you know or you don't know; thinking is impossible. What will
you think? If you start you will think, "This is my name, this is my
country, this is my family, this is my race, this is my caste, this is
my profession.…" But what will you find by doing this? You will not find
out who you are. These things are all on the periphery.</p><p>But Raman was not a master in the sense that he could explain to
people that watching the mind, the whole process of the mind, the whole
traffic of thoughts... Even "Who am I?" is a thought; don't get stuck to
it. Just watch that thought too, and a moment comes when all thinking
disappears -- just by watching. Just as you bring light into a dark room
and darkness disappears, as you bring watchfulness to your mind, mind
disappears.</p><p>And the disappearance of the mind is the beginning of knowing
yourself.</p><p>This is the highest peak of consciousness, and unless a man achieves
it, he has wasted his life in trivia. He lived only in name; in fact he
vegetated. He may have been a very rich vegetable... They say there are
only two kinds of vegetables, cabbage and cauliflower; the cabbage
category is uneducated, and the cauliflower is a cabbage with college
degrees.</p><p>But there is not much difference.</p><p>If you really want to live and not to vegetate, meditation is the
only way; and meditation means no-mind... just silence.</p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>YOU HAVE SPOKEN TO US ABOUT BEING IN THE WORLD YET NOT OF IT.</p><p>HOW COME YOU HAVE NOT SPOKEN TO US ABOUT BEING IN THE COMMUNE YET NOT
OF IT?</p><p>Deva Shravan, I have spoken about being in the world but not of it. A
commune is not a community, a commune is not a world, a commune is not a
society. A commune is a very friendly gathering of people who live in
the world but are not of the world.</p><p>A commune is not an organization, it is simply the gathering of
individuals. It does not take away anybody's individuality. It does not
destroy your dignity, your pride, your self-respect. On the contrary, it
gives you dignity, respect, love: it accepts you as you are. It does not
demand that you should be somebody else, then only will you be thought
worthy; it does not ask you to be a saint. It simply loves you as you
are. That's why in the commune there is no question at all...</p><p>How can I say to you, "Be in the commune but don't belong to it"? The
commune is basically individuals who have learned to be in the world and
not of the world. That statement is true about the world, because the
world tries to strangle you, the world tries to make you a prisoner in a
thousand and one ways. The commune gives you total freedom to be
yourself; there is no question of belonging to it. Each individual
exists as an individual, not as a part of the commune.</p><p>In the larger world each individual is only a cog in the wheel, he
does not exist as himself. He is only a number, just like in the armies.
A soldier dies... on the board of the office appears the notice that
"number sixteen has died." In the army names are not recognized, but
only numbers.</p><p>You will be surprised what the psychology is behind it; there is
tremendous meaning. If your name is recognized, then you have a wife,
you have children, you have old parents, an old father, an old mother,
who must be waiting for you, who must be praying that you come back home
alive. If you have a name, you are irreplaceable; but if you are just a
number -- number sixteen...</p><p>Numbers don't have wives, they don't have children, they don't have
parents -- nobody is waiting for them. In fact numbers can be replaced,
but names cannot be, individuals cannot be. Hence for centuries armies
have been changing people into numbers. So when somebody looks at the
board -- how many numbers have died -- he does not feel anything about
their wives, their children, their father,</p><p>their mother, their friends, all their hopes, all their prayers It is
a very cunning</p><p>strategy to deceive people. And these numbers can be immediately
replaced by other numbers; somebody else will become number sixteen.
There is no problem in replacing numbers.</p><p>Society also, in a more subtle way, makes you just a part; it never
allows you total freedom to be yourself. You are a husband, you are a
wife, you are a father, you are a brother... you are never yourself, you
are somebody else. There are a thousand and one expectations from you to
be fulfilled; those are your chains. There are responsibilities and
duties; those are your prisons.</p><p>In a commune you don't have a duty, you don't have a responsibility.
You don't have to be somebody else to be worthy, to be respected, to be
prestigious. Just as you are, in your utter nudeness, you are accepted,
loved. Your very being is enough, nothing more is needed.</p><p>You don't ask a roseflower to be somebody else, and you don't ask a
lotus to be somebody else. A marigold is as beautiful as the rose. The
world would be poorer if there were no marigolds, and only roses. The
world is richer because more variety is there.</p><p>Each individual in a commune is unique; in the world he is just a
carbon copy. In the commune, everybody is original; in the world, only a
true copy.</p><p>The world expects you to follow, imitate -- everything others are
doing you should do.</p><p>The commune does not ask anything of you; you should simply do what
is spontaneous to you, what you feel like doing. You should allow
yourself absolute freedom for your potential to blossom. Hence I have
not talked about the other part of your question, because that will be
against the very idea of the commune.</p><p>A commune is not an alternative society.</p><p>A commune is a brotherhood of rebellious souls.</p><p>Bernie was more than a little annoyed when a neighbor telephoned at
3:OO a.m. and complained, "Your dog is barking so loudly that I can't
sleep!" The neighbor hung up before he could reply.</p><p>The following morning at 3:OO a.m. Bernie called his neighbor and
said, "I don't have a dog!"</p><p>This is your world -- utterly insane! That's why I say that
unfortunately you have to be in it. Be, but don't belong to it; keep
yourself as much unimpressed, uninfluenced by others as possible. Keep
your originality; don't lose it in the crowd.</p><p>The young bride was inconsolable, in spite of the fact that her dead,
seventy- five-year-old husband had left her ten million dollars in his
will. Her friends tried to make her understand: "You are so young," they
said. "You have a great life ahead, and ten million dollars! He had to
die sooner or later."</p><p>"You don't understand," she sobbed. "He was the greatest lover. We
lived next door to the church and he used to make love to me by the
sound of the church bells -- ding-dong, ding-dong. And he would be alive
today if it wasn't for that damn fire truck!"</p><p>That's why I say: Don't belong to this world. Be in it, but be alert
that you don't get lost in the madness that is all over the earth.</p><p>Old man Finkelstein, aged eighty-five, went to a sperm bank to make a
deposit. The young woman at the reception was skeptical. "Are you sure
that you want to do this?" she asked.</p><p>"Yes," said old Finkelstein. "I feel it is my duty to give something
from myself to the world."</p><p>The woman gave him a jar and directed him to a room down the hall.
When thirty minutes had passed and he did not return, the girl began to
worry that he might have had a heart attack. But just then the old man
came out of the room and approached the woman.</p><p>"Listen," he said, "I tried it with one hand, then I tried it with
two hands, then I got it up and hit it on the sink, then I ran warm
water on it, then cold water over it, and I still can't get the lid of
the jar open!"</p><p>It is better not to be part of this insane world! Remain sane.
Insanity is normal in the world -- that's why you don't detect it. Once
you understand that it is the normal insanity, and you start looking
deeply into it, you will be immensely</p><p>surprised that you are living in a big madhouse.</p><p>The commune is a rebellion, it is not a revolution. A revolution
creates an alternative society. For example, what happened in the Soviet
Union was a revolution; it created an alternative society. But that
society is as insane as any other society; perhaps it has different
names for its insanity, but nothing has changed.</p><p>Seventy years after the revolution, people are standing in queues
just to get bread</p><p>-- even today. Seventy years ago they revolted against the czar to
make a new world where nobody will be poor, but what actually happened
is that they have created a world where nobody is rich. They have
brought equality to the world, that's certainly true: they have made
everybody equally poor. People in the Soviet Union, which is one sixth
of the whole world, are living in a concentration camp.</p><p>I have been in America, and my sannyasins in the Soviet Union are
trying for me to enter into the Soviet Union some day. Today they must
have gathered to celebrate -- they have informed me that they will be
gathering at the same time as we are. They have to gather in basements.
They have to read books silently, "underground," so nobody can hear.</p><p>The KGB, the Intelligence Department, has caught hold of twenty
sannyasins and has interrogated them continuously for weeks, harassed
them just because they had my books. They have taken away all their
books, and they were trying to force them to tell who the other
sannyasins are. And because they were not telling, they were harassed
continuously in the middle of the night; they would be called to the
police station and the whole night continuous interrogation... and this
is revolution!</p><p>Man has become even more a slave than he was ever before. Man was not
such a slave even in the days of the czar before the revolution; society
was not so dominant and so afraid of people and their freedom.</p><p>America makes claims of democracy. I lived there for five years, and
there is no democracy at all. It is one of the most hypocritical
societies; it is deceiving the whole world in the name of democracy. It
is another kind of dictatorship. But the whole world is like this.…</p><p>I have been refused entry by twenty-one countries. Even before I had
applied for</p><p>a tourist visa, the German parliament decided and ordered all the
borders and all the airports that if I try to enter into the country
from anywhere I am not allowed... not only that I am not allowed in the
country, my airplane has not to be allowed to land at any airport.</p><p>What kind of world have we made?</p><p>I have not done any harm to those people. I have never been in their
country. And what harm can I do if my airplane just lands for refueling
in their international airport? -- and why do you call it an
international airport? In what way can I affect their morality, their
religion, their tradition?</p><p>I was never aware that people can be so afraid of rational thinking,
of intelligent behavior. I had never thought that the whole world lives
under different kinds of superstitions. They are so afraid that somebody
may create an upheaval -- at least in the younger generation -- by
making them aware of their superstitions.</p><p>But to live under superstitions is to live blindly. That's why I say:
don't belong to this world. This is not the world for human beings, this
is not the world for intelligent people; this is an ugly world created
by millions of years of superstition and darkness, exploited by the
religious leaders, politicians and so- called moralists. They have all
proved to be parasites -- and nothing else.</p><p>A commune is not an alternative society. A commune is simply a
brotherhood without any organization, without any hierarchy. Nobody is
your religious leader and nobody is your political leader. Everybody is
simply allowed to be his natural self, without any judgment and without
any evaluation.</p><p>Question 3 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>I FOUND OUT THAT MY TWO BASIC INTERESTS ARE SEX AND MEDITATION.</p><p>AM I DOING RIGHT? I WANT TO BE YOUR FAVORITE DISCIPLE. WHAT TO</p><p>DO? WHICH IS THE WORST QUESTION TO ASK YOU?</p><p>Chaitanya, you have asked it! You say your interests are two: sex and
meditation. If sex is your interest, forget all about meditation. When
you get tired of sex, fed up with it, then the same energy that was
involved in sex can be used for meditation. But you can't have both
together -- that will be like riding on two horses together. Either you
have sex, or you have meditation.</p><p>But one thing you have to understand: you cannot have meditation
unless you have transcended sex. But transcendence should not be
understood in the old ways as repression. Transcendence is experience,
so much experience that you don't think anymore about attraction,
infatuation.</p><p>Sex simply drops like dry leaves from the trees.</p><p>It is not that you have to make some effort. If you have to make some
effort to drop it, it will remain with you. And if it is there,
meditation is impossible; it won't let you be silent. It is one of the
most torturous biological slaveries. It is good to get rid of it by
experiencing it with totality and intensity -- don't think of meditation
at all. Sex, lived totally, will bring you to meditation; and then
meditation will be very easy, because there will be no biological pull
against it. Your so-called priests, monks, saints, cannot meditate.</p><p>Even a man like Mahatma Gandhi, at the age of seventy, was having
sexual dreams. This was the result of a whole life of repression. And
finally at the age of seventy-five he started to sleep with young naked
girls.</p><p>His disciples, who had become the rulers of the country -- he was the
greatest spiritual and political leader, both -- tried to hide this
fact; the masses of the country should not know about it. They protected
him in every way. The news should not become common; people should not
come to know about it. There was a danger that he might lose all his
saintliness. People have respected him, followed him... and before his
death, he will see himself fallen, failed.</p><p>They tried to persuade him to stop this, but he had his explanations
and excuses. He used to tell them, "This is an experiment to check on my
celibacy -- whether I am really celibate or not."</p><p>Mind is very cunning. Nobody in the world has ever checked celibacy
this way before. If you are celibate, I don't think you will not know
whether you are or not, whether the idea of the other sex comes to your
mind or not. You don't need any test. You yourself will be enough to
know whether your mind is visited by</p><p>sexual ideas, dreams, fantasies, or not.</p><p>But the reality was he was tortured... and the reason was not that he
was insincere; he was a very sincere man, but he followed a wrong path
sincerely. Always remember: just sincerity is not going to help. You can
be very honest, very sincere, very arduous... but if you are on a wrong
path all your sincerity will lead you not to the goal you wanted to
reach, but exactly to its opposite.</p><p>Gandhi could never understand what meditation is, and that was one of
his greatest failures. He could not understand that you can be free from
any desire only if you have lived it completely, entirely. If something
has remained unlived it is going to haunt you.</p><p>Chaitanya, you are saying sex and meditation are your two basic
interests. Please have one basic interest! And sex is absolutely first,
because that is your biological bondage.</p><p>You have to get free of it, and the way to get free of it is not to
fight with it -- that's what religious people have been doing for
centuries. They have not succeeded.</p><p>Not a single person has succeeded in transcending sex by fighting it,
by repressing it.</p><p>Live it! -- and don't live it with guilt, don't live it as if it is
something wrong, it is a sin. It is not. It is neither a sin nor a
crime, it is an absolutely natural way of reproducing. You are not
responsible for it.</p><p>You are produced through sex. Your every cell is sexual. Nature has
found a way to go on reproducing life in new forms; sex is simply a
methodology which nature has chosen.</p><p>You cannot fight with nature. Nature is vast and tremendously strong,
but you can get beyond it, and the way beyond is through it -- not by
fighting, but by understanding, experiencing.… And the more you become
experienced, capable of understanding, it is absolutely easy to move
your energy into the second stage of evolution: from sex to
meditation.</p><p>Meditation is very simple if sex has been lived completely without
any fear, any repression, any guilt. My own understanding is that by the
time... just as at the</p><p>age of fourteen you become interested in sex, if you live perfectly
and totally and sincerely --</p><p>religiously -- your sexual life, by the age of forty-two you will be
out of it.</p><p>Life has seven year cycles. If you take as an average seventy years,
it has ten cycles of seven years. The first seven years you are
absolutely innocent -- you are just as a saint should be. Your second
seven years are a preparation for sex; slowly, slowly, the snake of sex
starts uncoiling within you. By the age of fourteen you are mature and
you can reproduce children. From fourteen to twenty-one your sexual
energy is at its highest peak, exactly between fourteen and twenty-one:
that means seventeen and a half is the climax of sexual energy.</p><p>But this society has lived with such repressive and unnatural,
unscientific ideas that these are the years when you are told to be
celibate. And these are the years when you could have lived sex, and
celibacy would have come by itself by the time you are forty-two.</p><p>Between twenty-one and twenty-eight, sex is very normal, very
natural. From twenty-eight to thirty-five, sex starts declining. From
thirty-five to forty-two, sex reaches its ultimate decline. From
forty-two to forty-nine, sex disappears. That's why in ancient India the
wise people decided that by the time one is fifty-one should start
preparing for vanprashtha. His face should be now towards the mountains,
towards the forest -- that is the meaning of vanprashtha. He is still in
the world, but now his whole consciousness has turned and he is getting
ready to move into the deep forest to be alone. The days of meditation
have come.</p><p>By the time a person is fifty his children will be nearabout
twenty-five. They must be getting married, they must be getting into a
profession. The father can look forward to twenty-five years more...
these are the twenty-five years, from fifty to seventy-five, that he can
watch -- he can live in the world yet not be of the world. He can watch
his children slowly taking over. And after seventy-five all his interest
in the world will have disappeared; then meditation will be his only
interest.</p><p>But this is just a formal categorization. It depends on you and your
intensity of living.</p><p>You can be beyond sex by the time you are thirty-five. You can be
beyond sex without much difficulty when you are forty-two. But it is
unfortunate that people</p><p>die still as foolish as young people.</p><p>Psychologists have come to the conclusion that most people die with
the idea of sex...</p><p>that is their last idea. They may be repeating the name of God, but
inside they are thinking, If only it was possible one time more...! They
have not lived their life wholeheartedly. That's why something that
should have ended at forty-two has continued up to eighty, up to
ninety.</p><p>Chaitanya, live your first interest and be finished with it. But be
finished with it by living it, joyously! There is nothing wrong, there
is no sin. Then meditation will become absolutely simple and easy,
because your mind will not be burdened with sexual infatuation and
desires. That is your only bondage. All other bondages are secondary,
all other bondages are branches of your sexuality.</p><p>For what do you want money? For what do you want power? Have you
watched that all other interests are centered on sex? A man without
money will not be able to get the most beautiful woman; a man without
power will not be able to get the most beautiful woman.</p><p>All your so-called desires are centered on a single fact, a single
interest, and that is sex.</p><p>Just live it, and live it joyously without any fear of hell or
heaven. There is no hell, no heaven.</p><p>Once you are out of sex, once it has disappeared like smoke
disappearing into the sky and you cannot see it, then meditation is so
easy. You don't have to make any effort, you have just to sit silently
with your eyes closed, relaxed, and you will find meditation is
there.</p><p>Sex and meditation...? You will not be able to live sex fully, and
that will go on lingering with you. And you will not be able to meditate
because sex will continuously interfere.</p><p>You know the stories of the old seers, that even at their height, in
their old age, after a long, long preparation of austerities, fasting,
chanting, studying holy scriptures -- doing everything -- when they come
to the point of realization, the stories say that suddenly apsaras from
heaven... Apsaras are nothing but</p><p>heavenly prostitutes, specially provided for the saints. They are
sent down to disturb these poor fellows' meditation.</p><p>This is strange, why should anybody be bothered about these poor
fellows who have been torturing themselves in every possible way --
starving, fighting with their body, repressing their sex? There is
nobody who is sending these apsaras, and these apsaras are nowhere. It
is just their own repressed sexuality that starts coming up in
fantasies, in hallucinations.</p><p>And it is so simple... if you want to experiment with what
hallucination is, just go to a mountain cave alone, fast three weeks,
and don't meet anyone. By the end of the second week you will start
talking to yourself -- and not only will you talk, you will answer
also!</p><p>By the third week you will start seeing people... if you are a man
you will see women; if you are a woman you will see men. By the fourth
week you will not be able to make a distinction at all whether the woman
that you see sitting in front of you in the cave is real or an
hallucination...!</p><p>Just four weeks' experiment and you will know how apsaras have come.
They will come to you too;they have not stopped the process of coming.
But it is simply the hallucination of your repressed desire, so deeply
repressed that it takes revenge -- with a vengeance.</p><p>My suggestion to you is, first sex, because it is more basic to your
body, to your life; it is the foundation of life. Meditation is the
highest peak, but sex is the roots. First think of the roots.</p><p>Meditation is the flowers. They come at the very end, at the very top
of the tree; they will come. But don't try both together, otherwise you
will remain wishy- washy, always halfhearted... meditating and thinking
about sex, making love and thinking about Gautam Buddha! This will
simply drive you crazy.</p><p>And you are asking, "I want to be your favorite disciple."</p><p>I feel scared! Please just remain a disciple! I don't have any
favorite disciples, because to have favorite disciples means people who
will betray you, people who will become Judases, people who will
assassinate you. People who are first trying to be favorite disciples
soon would like you to move over, give place to them; now they want to
be masters. I don't want any favorite disciples. This is</p><p>simple politics. Just keep to the space where you are. I am feeling
perfectly at ease; when you come too close... I am allergic!</p><p>And you are saying, "What to do? Which is the worst question to ask
you?" You cannot ask it. What worse question can you ask? You have asked
it. But I can answer you, as bad as you like! Just I am looking for a
worse...! So just be patient! It is really the worst, so just be
quiet.</p><p>An English lady was on holiday in the wild west. One day she decided
to visit an Indian reservation and became interested in the number of
feathers in the men's headdresses. So she asked one brave, and he
replied, "Me only have one feather because me only have one squaw."</p><p>Thinking this was a joke, she asked another brave. "Me only have four
feathers because me only have four squaws," he replied.</p><p>Somewhat perturbed, the English lady decided to ask the chief, who
had a magnificent headdress full of feathers. "Me Chief," he replied,
"so me fuck them all! Big, small, short, tall... me fuck them all!"</p><p>The lady was horrified. "You ought to be hung!" she cried. "You
damned right," said the Chief, "me hung like a buffalo!" The English
lady cried, "You don't have to be so hostile!" "Hoss-style, dog-style,
any style... me fuck them all!"</p><p>With tears in her eyes, the lady cried, "Oh, dear "</p><p>"No deer," said the Chief, "Deer run too fast and asshole too high!"

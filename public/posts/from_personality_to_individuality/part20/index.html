Question 1 OSHO,
IS IT WRONG TO TRY TO SAVE SOMEBODY? IS IT NOT PART OF COMPASSION?

IS IT NOT PART OF COMPASSION?\nCOMPASSION is a very delicate affair. It certainly has some place in making an effort to save others, but there are many conditions which have to be fulfilled first.\nThe first condition is that you are saved; otherwise, in the name of saving others you will be simply destroying them. And in the effort of saving others you will be missing the opportunity to save yourself Only a person who has come home himself can be of any help to somebody. A blind man cannot help blind people. You must have your eyes opened; you must have seen light yourself before you start telling others what it is.\nCompassion certainly includes the idea of saving others, but not against their will. If somebody does not want to be saved, you are not to force him; not at the point of a sword do you have to save him. That is not saving. That simply shows that in the name of saving you are trying to dominate people.\nIn Raipur there is an old, very ancient pond. Because of its ancientness it is called budha talub – old, aged, pond, and it belongs to the part of Raipur which is the ancientmost part. That part is also called budha padu – ancient part, very old; budha means old man. And the pond is certainly very beautiful in its oldness; all the old stone steps are covered with thick moss.\nI used to go there just to sit because nobody goes there. The pond has become dirty; thick moss floats on the water and the water is almost green. The pond has not been cleaned for years, so nobody goes there. And there are other ponds in other places, so there is no need; the water is not used any more. And because it was such a silent place I used to go there every evening to sit and see the sunset.\nOne day when I was sitting there a man suddenly fell into the pond and started shouting, “help! Help!” I had not seen him when he came by, or how he slipped. Anybody could have slipped, those steps were so slippery with moss. I jumped in to help that man and I pulled him out somehow. He was very angry.\nHe said to me, “Why did you do that?”\nI said, “This is strange! You were asking for help.”\nHe said, “Yes, I was asking for help because I became so afraid, but really I wanted to commit suicide – and you prevented me. I would not have shouted if I had any idea that somebody else was present here; nobody comes here. What are you doing here?”\nI said, “This is strange, but when you started shouting,‘Help! Help!’ I thought you were drowning. I have unnecessarily become wet in this muddy pond and you are now angry.”\nHe said, “Yes, I am certainly angry because that shout was just out of fear. I was not meaning to be saved.”\nSo do you know what I did? I simply pushed him back in. What else to do? And he started shouting again, “Help! Help!”\nAnd I said, “Now I am not going to help. I have helped twice: the first time by getting you out; the second, by pushing you back in. Now do whatsoever you want.”\nHe said, “What kind of man are you?” And he was drowning – coming up and going down, and crying, “Help!”\nI said, “Not against your will.\nHe said, “I am saying HELP” – but I simply sat there.\nI said, “You try yourself” He was not far away from the bank because I had just pulled him out, he was just close, so it was perfectly clear that he would manage. And he did manage. He got a little water inside him but he came out and said, “You are a strange man.”\nI said, “I am a strange man? You are a strange man! First I saved you; you were angry. Then I helped you by throwing you back in; you were angry again, and started crying out for help.”\nHe said, “Yes, when I get into water I become afraid of death, but really I want to commit suicide.”\nI said, “Then you come at some other time because at this time I am always here, and if you start shouting’Help!’ then it looks very strange not to help. But I cannot help you against your will.\nCompassion cannot allow you even to do good to the other person if he is not ready for it. Compassion gives total freedom, respect and dignity to the other person.\nAll these people who have been trying to save others are just a by-product of Christianity and its conditioning.\nIn Buddhism there is no place for saving anybody. Buddha says, “I can show you the way, but you will have to walk. I cannot walk for you. And if you don’t want to walk, who am I to force you to walk? At the most I can say I have walked the path, and the beauties of the path I can describe, but I cannot force you in any way. That will not be compassion, that will be cruelty. If it is your pleasure to go some other way, then all my blessings are with you. Even if you are going to hell, my blessings are with you.”\nMahavira has taken a very clear stand: “Nobody has ever been saved by anybody else. It is by its very nature not possible, because if somebody can save you, then somebody can unsave you also. Then your being saved is not something in your possession, it is given by somebody. It is just like somebody can give you money and somebody else can steal it – you are not the master of it. And at least your self-realization, your enlightenment, must be something of which you are the master, which nobody can deprive you of.\n“It is simple logic: if somebody can give it to you, then somebody can deprive you of it; there is no problem in it. If you can be forced to be enlightened, you can be forced to be unenlightened.”\nMahavira is very clear, and I agree with him, that at least one ultimate thing should be left to the individual. And enlightenment is the ultimate experience. It should not be borrowed, given, purchased, forced; otherwise it won’t be the real thing.\nIt is the Christian stupidity that has spread the idea; no other religion before Christianity had ever thought of saving somebody. If you know the way, you know the joys of the way; you can sing the song, you can dance the dance. If somebody feels like moving with you, being a fellow traveler, not a follower, then he is welcome. But there is no enforcement and you are not obliging him.\nThese are the beautiful points which have arisen in the Eastern consciousness over thousands of years, that even if you show the way, you give the details of the path and you give the discipline, you don’t make the other person feel obliged to you. You are not doing it for him; it is just your own experience which wants to be shared. He is obliging you by hearing you, by giving you a chance to share your experience. He is helping you to be unburdened of the fragrance that you are carrying – and you want to be unburdened; you have to be thankful to the person – the question of saving does not arise.\nBut after Christianity it became an almost universal phenomenon. After Christianity came Mohammedanism, and of course they went to the very logical end: either you have to be ready to be saved or be ready to die. They don’t give you any other choice, because they believe that if\nyou go on living unsaved you may commit sins and you will suffer in hell. By killing you they are at least taking away all the opportunities of falling into hell.\nAnd to be killed by a savior is almost to be saved. That’s what Mohammedans have been saying, that if you kill somebody in order to save him, he is saved; God will look after it. He is saved and you are accumulating more virtue in saving so many people. Mohammedans have killed millions of people in the East. And the strange thing is that they believed they were doing the right thing. And whenever somebody does a wrong thing believing that it is right, then it is more dangerous. You cannot persuade him otherwise, he does not give you a chance to be persuaded. In India I tried in every possible way to approach Mohammedan scholars, but they are unapproachable. They don’t want to discuss any religious matter with somebody who is not a Mohammedan.\nThey have a word of condemnation for the person who is not a Mohammedan. Just as Christians call him a heretic, Mohammedans call him kaffir – which is even worse than heretic. Kaffir comes from a word, kufr; kufr means sin, a sinner. Kaffir means a sinner: anybody who is not a Mohammedan is a sinner. There are no other categories, only two categories. Either you are a Mohammedan, then you are a saint.Just by being a Mohammedan you are a saint, you are saved, because you believe in\none God, one prophet – mohammed – and one holy book, the KORAN. These three things believed is enough for you to be a saint. And those who are not Mohammedans are all kaffirs, sinners.\nIt is a strange fact that India has the greatest population of Mohammedans – even today, after Pakistan was divided from India. Before the division, certainly India was the biggest Mohammedan country in the world. With Pakistan, it was hoped that now Mohammedans were going to have their own country. They got a great portion of the country, according to their population, but all the Mohammedans did not move to Pakistan. All the Hindus in Pakistan were killed, so Pakistan is purely a Mohammedan country. But the Mohammedans who did not move to Pakistan and who remain in India are still more in numbers than in any other country in the world, Pakistan included.\nIndia, although a Hindu country, has the biggest number of Mohammedans. Still it is impossible to communicate. I have tried my best, but if you are not a Mohammedan then how can you understand? There is no question of any dialogue: you are a kaffir.\nI had a professor as my colleague in the university, who loved me very much. He was a Mohammedan. I asked him, “Farid, can’t you manage?” Because Jabalpur is one of the big centers\nof Mohammedans and it has great scholars. One very famous scholar, Burhanuddin, was there. He was old, and famous all over India and outside India also as a scholar of Mohammedanism. I asked Farid, “Find some way for me to have a dialogue with him.”\nHe said, “Ft is really difficult – unless you can pretend to be a Mohammedan.”\nI said, “That too is very difficult, because then you have to teach me a few basic things of Mohammedanism – their prayer and what they do. And moreover that Burhanuddin knows me – we have spoken many times from the same platform – so it will be very difficult for me to act. I can try, there is no harm. At the most we may get caught and we can laugh at the whole thing.”\nHe said, “You can laugh, but my position will be very bad. They will kill me because you are a Mohammedan and you are supporting a kaffir, and deceiving one of your great masters.” But he was\nwilling to do it. He started teaching me the language, Urdu. It was difficult to learn because it is just absolutely the opposite of any language that is born of Sanskrit. An Urdu book starts from the back and the sentence starts from the right corner and goes towards the left.\nIt is so difficult to get adjusted: it is just upside down, the whole thing. You have to open the book from the end; that is the beginning. And then the sentence starts from the right and moves towards the left. And because of the way the Urdu language is written a perfect way has not yet been found to print it or type it. The way it is written is not scientific at all; most of it has to be guessed. So those who are accustomed to read it, they can read it because they can guess what it will be. But for somebody who is learning, it is very difficult to guess.\nBut for six months I tried. I learned enough so that I could deceive somebody into thinking that I was not very educated, but a little bit. I learned their prayers; Farid managed to get a wig for me and cut my beard like the Mohammedans cut theirs. And their beard is so strange that even when I think of it again now my stomach starts churning. But I went through it; they cut my mustache off completely and left just my beard.\nI said, “my God” If you had told me before then I would not have wasted these six months!” In a way they were right, because I know that a mustache is such a difficult thing – particularly a mustache like mine which is not trimmed but is wild. I don’t allow Mukta to trim it. It is difficult even to drink tea or to drink fruit juice because half of it will remain on the mustache. So Mohammedans have found a way: they cut off the mustache, they shave the mustache, and they keep the beard. But that looks so ugly.\nBut I said, “Okay, we will do it. Now, for a few days I will not leave my house. Just give me a wig and let me see Burhanuddin.” It certainly changed my face completely when Farid cut my beard like the Mohammedans’ – very thin along the jawline and just a little bit of beard on the chin – like Lenin’s, a little less. Without a mustache and with a wig I looked different.\nWe went there, but the old man detected something about my eyes. He said, “I have seen those eyes somewhere.”\nI said, “My God! Farid, where could Maulana” – Maulana means master; he was known as Maulana Burhanuddin – “have seen me? – because I have never been to this city.”\nFarid was trembling, he was having a nervous breakdown: we had never thought about the eyes. That old man continued to look, and he said, “I suspect something.”\nI said, “Farid, he suspects something.” Farid just fell at his feet and he said, “There is no need to suspect – you know this man. And forgive me, I was just trying to help him because he wanted to have a dialogue with you.”\nBut he said, “First tell me who he is, because as far as I can remember, I have known the man and I have seen him many times. You have just cut off his mustache.”\nI said; ’Now it is better, Farid, that you tell the whole thing, that not only have you cut off my mustache” I took off the wig and I said, “Look at the wig.”\nThe moment I was without the wig, Burhanuddin immediately recognized me, and he said, “YOU!\nI said, “What else to do? You know me perfectly but you will not have a personal talk with me. Do you think that just being a Mohammedan is enough to be a saint? And what sin have I committed?\n“Certainly I am not a Mohammedan, but Mohammed himself was not a Mohammedan when he was born. Was he a kaffir, a sinner? And can you tell me who converted Mohammed to Islam? He was never converted. Just as Jesus remained a Jew, Mohammed remained a pagan all his life; Mohammedanism is something that started after his death. So if Mohammed, a kaffir, can become the messenger of God, can’t I discuss the message?”\nBurhanuddin said, “This is what I was afraid of That s why we don’t encourage any dialogue between Mohammedans and non-Mohammedans.”\nI said, “That simply shows your weakness. What is the fear? I am opening myself to you, to be saved by you. Save me – and if you cannot save me then let me try to save you.”\nBut that man simply turned towards Farid and said, “Take him away – I don’t want to talk any more. And you have to come tomorrow to see me.”\nAnd Farid was punished, beaten. I could not believe it: he was a professor at the university, a well- known scholar who was a guide to many research students working on Mohammedanism, on Urdu literature, the KORAN. Burhanuddin had a few hooligans there – they gave Farid a good beating. He showed me his body; all over his body were signatures of the Mohammedan attitude.\nHe said, “I told you before, that if something goes wrong.They have only beaten me because I\nam a well-known person – if I were somebody else they would have killed me.”\nFrom Christianity the stupidity has moved to Mohammedanism. But except for these two religions no religion believes that you can save anybody; and in fact those other religions know more about compassion than these two religions. This idea of being a savior is simply illogical. Try to understand it.\nYou have been living for many lives; you have been doing things on your own. Now it is your responsibility to undo all that. How can I undo it? I have not done it, I have never been a partner with you in doing it. You have lived an absolutely free, individual life for many lives, and according to that you have grown and come to this stage where you are. This is not accidental, this is the growth of a long, long process. Now to undo that process you will have to take great responsibility on yourself I can show you the way I have undone my process. Certainly, the same method will help you to undo your process – perhaps with a little modification here and there. That you have to work out.\nYou can work it out with me, but that is going to be a dialogue, not dictation. I cannot dictate to you, aDo this,” and give you a simple panacea so that you will be saved: “believe in me and you are saved.” Then not believing in me would be the only problem. Do you think that is the only problem, not believing in me? If that is the only problem then certainly in believing in me the problem is solved, you are saved. But that is not the problem. In your believing in me, your anger will still remain anger, your greed will still remain greed, your jealousy will still remain jealousy.\nBelieving in me or Jesus or Mohammed is not going to change anything.\nDo you think people who believe in Jesus are different in any way from people who don’t believe in Jesus, who believe in Mohammed, who believe in somebody else? No, they are not different. Deep down they are the same people, with the same jealousy, with the same arrogance, the same egoism, same violence. Everything is the same, all the garbage is the same.\nBelieving changes nothing at all, so how can you be saved? The whole idea is idiotic.\nMahavira and Buddha are far more sophisticated than Jesus and Mohammed. One of my arguments with Jaina monks began with this same question. Mahavira says: “Nobody can save anybody except himself. Everybody has to save himself.” Buddha says: “Be a light unto yourself” That was his last message before he died.\nWhen Buddha was dying his closest disciple, Ananda, started crying. Thousands of disciples were there, at least ten thousand disciples were there. They were all ready to burst into tears, but they were holding back their tears somehow because Buddha would not like it: “At least while he is going beyond our reach let him go feeling that his disciples have followed his message.”\nBut Ananda could not contain himself. It was difficult for everybody, but for Ananda it was more difficult because for at least sixty years he had been like a shadow to Buddha, serving him in every possible way without asking anything in return. It was just a sheer joy to serve him and to sit silently while he was talking to others, answering others. Ananda would never interrupt. It is very difficult to find such a devoted person.\nHe was Buddha’s elder brother, his cousin-brother; he was older than Buddha. Before he was initiated into sannyas Ananda had asked Buddha three things. He said, “After being initiated I will be your disciple; whatsoever you say there is no question, I have to do it, and I will do it. But right now I am still your elder brother, so as an elder brother promise me three things and then initiate me, because after that I will never be able to ask anything.” He asked three things, but he never used a single promise.\nOne was: “you will not say to me,‘Ananda, you go somewhere else to spread the word.’ I am going to remain with you to serve you. You have to promise me.” The second was: “Even if in the middle of the night I bring somebody who needs your help, you cannot refuse them. Anybody whom I bring to you, you have to help; whether you are tired after the whole day’s work or not, it doesn’t matter. If I bring somebody to you, you have to help him, you cannot refuse.”\nAnd the third was: “If I ask a question, you cannot tell me, as you tell others,‘Be silent for two years, three years, meditate, and then I will answer.’ No, you will have to answer immediately.” As his younger brother, Buddha promised Ananda that these three things would be granted to him.\nBut Ananda was a rare man; otherwise, Buddha would have hesitated to accept these conditions, because initiation cannot be given in a conditional way. He could have simply said, “If you put conditions on me then initiation is not possible” – because many other times a few other people had come with conditions and he had refused them; but to Ananda he gave the promise. That is unprecedented in the whole history of initiation. But I can understand why he did it; he knew Ananda\nfrom his childhood – he was not a man to take advantage of anything. Buddha knew that Ananda would never use those promises – he could be given them.\nAnd Ananda never used them. He never asked a single question, he never brought a single person; and of course, Buddha never told him to go away. If Buddha had said to, Ananda would have gone-he would not have even mentioned the promise-but Buddha never asked him.\nThis man could not contain himself: sixty years was so long to be together. He had been just like a shadow-and now he was left alone. Tears came to his eyes. Buddha opened his eyes to look, to have a last look at his disciples. Seeing tears in Ananda’s eyes he said, “Ananda, be a light unto yourself I was not your light, and I was not your savior. My death makes no difference. In fact, now you will have to understand what I have been telling you for sixty years: don’t remain in any illusion that just because you are serving me and you are being with me devotedly – it is very difficult to find such a devotion – still that is not going to save you.”\nYou have to go through a transformation. And that only you can do.\nIt is such an inner work that even the Master cannot reach there. Except for you, nobody can reach there.\nAnd this is the beauty of the human soul:\nIt is absolutely unavailable to anybody. Your center is so protected by existence:\nNobody can even touch it.\nThe question of saving somebody does not arise. Yes, the man of compassion tries his best to explain to you the way, to explain to you how it has happened to him. But that is simply sharing his story with you. Perhaps out of that story you can get some hints for yourself, but that is up to you.\nIn these twenty-five centuries since Mahavira and Buddha, Buddhism has completely disappeared from India because Buddhist monks could not compromise with Hinduism in any way. And I think that it is perfectly right: there is no need to compromise with anybody. Rather than compromising they preferred either to be killed, burned, or to leave the country. So a very strange thing happened: Buddhism was born in India, Buddha was born in India, and yet in India there are no Buddhists. And there was a time when the whole of India was afire with Buddhism. Either they had to die... but not a single Buddhist is known to have been converted, it is impossible. If you have understood something how can somebody else convert you?\nThey left the country and spread all over Asia, so the whole of Asia turned to Buddhism. Except for India the whole continent is Buddhist. Buddhists from all over Asia come to India to pay homage to the place where Buddha had become enlightened. The temple that was made as a memorial\nfor Buddha’s enlightenment has a brahmin priest because Buddhists disappeared from India so totally that even to find a priest.For the memorial temple of Buddha’s enlightenment there was no\nBuddhist available. And a brahmin.Buddha’s whole revolution is against brahminism.\nBut brahmins are professional priests. You can tell them anything, you pay for it, and they will be the priest – it doesn’t matter. And to them it really doesn’t matter because Hinduism has thirty-three million gods. When you can worship thirty-three million gods, one or two more makes no difference. And they are not getting involved in your religion: just purely as professionals they perform the worship.\nI have talked with this brahmin priest who is worshipping in Buddha’s temple, just as a heritage. For centuries his family has been worshipping there; they are almost the owners of the place. I asked him, “Are you influenced in any way by Buddha?”\nHe said, “The question does not arise – we are professional priests. Somebody is a professional doctor, somebody is a professional engineer; that does not mean that becomes his religion. My religion is Hinduism and I go to the Hindu temple to worship for myself. This is simply a paid job. I am being paid; and I go on receiving many gifts because visitors come from all the Buddhist countries – Sri Lanka, Japan, Vietnam, Indonesia, Indo-China, China, Korea, Taipei, the whole of Asia. So many gifts go on coming to me, it is a really profitable job, but I am a brahmin and I am against Buddhism.”\nBuddhists disappeared because they did not compromise, and Jainism remained a small stream because it did compromise. It was one of the questions of debate for me all over India when meeting Jaina monks or meeting them on a stage in some conference. They would all say, “Mahavira was born to redeem the whole of mankind from sin.”\nI said, “This is absolutely wrong – you are just put ting Mahavira’s name in place of Jesus Christ. It is a Christian influence, it is not at all in tune with Mahavira. He was not born to redeem the whole world, and if he was, the proof is there that the world is not redeemed. Nor has Jesus’ crucifixion redeemed the world. Nobody has been able to redeem the world – it is nobody’s business to. If you can redeem yourself, that is more than enough. And if you can spread a little bit of light and fragrance around you, you are fortunate and blessed.”\nSaving somebody is really a thankless job – you know, the way I saved the man in that ancient pond in Raipur. He was shouting, “Help! Help!” but he could not believe it when I pushed him back. When he came out he said, “The first time it was okay because I was shouting,‘Help! Help!’ – but I was just standing there and you pushed me?”\nI said, “I was simply undoing what I had done, because it was wrong, against your will. If you want to commit suicide all my blessings are with you. If just a little push is needed, I am not so miserly that I won’t give it to you.”\nIt happened when I was a student that I had a friend who was in love with a Bengali girl. He was not a Bengali, but he was really a fanatic lover. He almost transformed himself into a Bengali; he even started speaking Hindi the way Bengalis speak. It was impossible to detect that he was not a Bengali because he was speaking Bengali very perfectly. That can be understood; but he started speaking Hindi which was his mother tongue, the way Bengalis speak it – and Bengalis destroy it!\nHe learned that too just to influence that girl and her parents, to show that although he was not a born Bengali, he was almost a Bengali. He started dressing himself the Bengali way and he started carrying an umbrella, which Bengalis always do – I don’t know why. If it is raining it is okay, if it is hot it is okay; but no matter whether it is raining or not, hot or not, cold or not, an umbrella is always with them. It is a multipurpose thing: to drive dogs away, to beat somebody or to fight with somebody. It has many purposes and is always handy. It has just become part of the Bengali personality – so he started carrying an umbrella.\nI said, “Thakur” – he was by caste a Thakur.\nHe said, “You are my friend, but don’t call me Thakur, call me’Thakoor’ the way Bengalis say it”the “u” in Thakur becomes “o”: Thakoor – “otherwise our friendship is finished.”\nI said, “I am not a Bengali and it looks so foolish to call you Thakoor; I will be unnecessarily wasting my breath. Thakur is perfectly good.”\nBut the family refused him, because Bengalis are very arrogant in that matter. They are just like French people in Europe. They think their language is the best and their culture is the best. Even if a Frenchman understands English he won’t speak it, he will speak in French. He cannot fall down so low and just speak English. Bengalis do the same: they can speak Hindi but they won’t.\nI have been visiting Calcutta hundreds of times but only Hindi-speaking people would come to listen to me. Even in Calcutta – which is the capital for Bengalis – not a single Bengali would turn up for a meeting. I had a few friends who would come to see me, and I asked them, “Why don’t you come to the meetings?\nThey said, “Unless you start speaking in Bengali, no Bengali is going to come.”\nYou will be surprised that in Calcutta they call everybody who is outside Bengal an Indian. They are Bengalis, and everybody, except them, is an Indian. That was strange to know. For the first time I came to know in Bengal that I am Indian and they are Bengalis.\nSo the family refused Thakur. They said, “You may speak Bengali, you may even speak Hindi the way Bengalis speak, you may carry an umbrella; you have managed everything well.…” The boy started eating fish and rice, because that is the most important food for Bengalis – rice and fish. He would not eat any other sweets than Bengali sweets. He was really a Majnu, a Farhad, a Romeo – that kind of person.\nBut the family refused him, they said, “We won’t accept you.” But he was not going to take any no from them. He closed himself in his room and his family all tried to persuade him to open the door.\nHe said, “I am not going to open the door. I am going to die in this room unless you go and persuade that family. Either I have to marry their daughter or I am going to die.”\nNow the family said, “How can we persuade them? Those people don’t even consider themselves Indians. You have become almost a Bengali.”\n“If they have refused you,” the father said, “they will not even talk to me because that’s far below them. Bengalis have culture, they have great poets and great scientists and everything great. They won’t listen to me.”\nStill, he went – what else to do? Thakur was his only son, and he was being so foolish that he wouldn’t open the door. The father went. He was a well-known doctor, but the family said, “We are sorry, but we cannot give our daughter to an Indian family. You will not be able to give her the comforts, the food, the culture, that she is accustomed to, so it is not going to happen. Just persuade your son.”\nThe trouble was that the girl was not interested, otherwise I would have managed something. I told the boy, “It is not a problem of being a Bengali or a non-bengali. I would have managed something if the girl was interested in you, but she is not interested at all; otherwise you could have eloped. I would have managed it.”\nI had done it two or three times in my life. I had even arranged for my own brother to elope with a girl, because my younger brother fell in love with the daughter of the landlord of the house where I used to live.\nMy landlord was furious, but I said, “Don’t be worried; I will persuade my brother when he comes next” – because he was studying in the engineering college, so he came whenever he had time; the engineering college was almost ten miles away from the place – “whenever he comes I will explain things to him. Don’t be worried.”\nMeanwhile I asked his daughter, “what do you want? If you are really willing then tomorrow you both escape – I will arrange everything. He is madly in love with you but the question is, are you in love with him?”\nShe said, “I am more madly in love with him than he is with me.”\nSo I said, “Then it is perfect.” I arranged a magistrate, but he was not willing to perform the marriage in Jabalpur because the legal procedure is that one month’s notice has to be posted on the court board:“such and such persons are going to be married. If anybody has any objection.”\nBut one month is a long time; if her father came to know.… I said, “Do one thing. Post it, back-date it one month tonight. Who will prove that it was not there for one month? On your notice board there are hundreds of notices. Just paste it in a corner. It should be there – back-dated.”\nHe said, “You don’t know law or anything.”\nI said, “You have to do it. It is not a question of law, it is a question of love. You have to do it! And I have never asked anything of you – and I am not asking for myself. But my young brother and this girl will both suffer their whole life. They will suffer anyway but let them suffer together! If they want that then it is my duty to help – you just help too.”\nHe said okay. In the night he placed a back-dated notice on the board, but he was very afraid that something might go wrong, even in the morning – the court did not open till then. He said, “What I\nwill do is this: I will go to a village nearby where I go occasionally for tours as a magistrate. So you send your brother and the girl there – nobody will be able to prevent them.”\nSo he went away, thirty or forty miles, and stayed in a guesthouse. I drove my brother and his girlfriend there and got them married – the magistrate signed and sealed everything. But his fear was right, because some clerk of his court found that back-dated note. The clerk knew the girl’s father, so he immediately phoned and said, “Do you know your girl is going to be married? Today is the last day to register any objections, and the magistrate is not here, he has gone on tour.”\nThe father came running from his shop. I was missing, and the girl was missing. They went around the whole town; their whole family was searching to find where we had gone. By the evening we returned. I went to Delhi; I said to my brother, “I am not coming home for a few days. Go to my father’s house in the village, don’t go to the girl’s father. Go to my father’s house; I will phone my father and tell him, ‘I have got one of your sons married and I am sending him and his wife to you, so receive them well at the station.’”\nMy father said, “You are just a trouble, because you have already done it without asking me. Now I can’t do anything about it – I will go to the station and receive them.”\nI said, “Give them a good reception, because the girl’s father is not going to give any reception. And I will not be there because I don’t want to be seen with them; otherwise... he is my landlord and he will throw me out and make me leave the house.”\nAfter three days I came back. The landlord looked at me and he said, “Where have you been?” I said, “I went to New Delhi.”\nHe said, “Yes, I see you must have gone, but what happened to my daughter?”\nI said, “I don’t know. What happened to your daughter? I am not your daughter’s guardian.” So he said, “You don’t know anything?”\nI said, “No, I don’t.”\nHe said, “They got married!”\nI said, “This is news to me. Who married them?” Then I persuaded him: “If they have got married then why make an unnecessary fuss about it? Give them a good reception. They are already married – you cannot do anything. Legally she is adult, he is adult; you cannot do anything legally. And you have showed me the one month’s notice: what were you doing for one month? And now, when they have got married, you think about it? Be a little cool. This will be unnecessarily a scandal for your family. Why make it a scandal? Give them a good reception and say that this is with our wishes that they have got married.”\nHe said, “It seems right; there is no point in doing otherwise.”\nSo I arranged it; I arranged that my father give a good reception to them. I organized things with the landlord and then I phoned my father, “Now you can bring the marriage procession to Jabalpur: her father is willing to give a good reception.”\nSo I told Thakur, “I have been arranging marriages – there is no problem – but the girl simply hates you, it is not just that she does not love you. Even if she were not in love I would have persuaded her, talked to her; at least she could feel compassion for you”because for six years continually he had been trying to become a Bengali, and he had become one. “But the girl simply hates you; she says it is impossible!”\nBut he would not open the door and he was threatening, “If you do anything I have poison inside.” He did have poison because he had got poison from his father’s dispensary. “I will drink it if you force me or if you try to break down the doors.”\nThe father said to me, “Now do something.” I went to the door. I said, “Listen, Thakoor.”\nHe said, “So it is you?” – because he understood, nobody else would call him Thakoor. I said, “Yes, it is I.”\nHe said, “I want to commit suicide.”\nI said, “I will arrange it – just come out with me. Here it will be difficult: even if you take the poison you are not going to die immediately. Your father is a doctor; the door can be broken down and you can be saved from the poison. It is not such a great thing. I found out from your father that that poison can kill, but it will take at least eighteen to twenty-fours hours for the man to die. Meanwhile the poison can be got out or an antidote can be given. So you see, it is simply foolish. Just come with me; my car is waiting outside, just come with me.”\nHe came out and I took him home. I said, “The best place to die is by the marble rocks. It is one of the most beautiful places in the world.” For two continuous miles the Narmada flows between two mountains of white marble. On the full-moon night it is an absolute dreamland: you can’t believe that things can be so beautiful. So I said to him, “This is good; although it is not full-moon night it is very close. In just two days time it will be full moon. If you can wait for two days, good; otherwise still it is good light. And you are going to die so what does it matter whether it is a full-moon night or a no-moon night?\n“I will drive you early in the morning – because that is the best time. In the night there are people and you may be saved, because when the moon is there many people go for picnics or for boating, so it is full. But in the morning there is nobody. It is a night place. In the day there is no beauty – if you see it in the day you will not believe it is the same place that you saw in the night... a millionfold difference.”\nI had actually requested the governor, who was my friend, “Close this place during the day. Nobody should be allowed to enter to see the marble rocks then because it destroys the beauty of the marble rocks. It should be open only when the moon is there, only for a few nights.”\nHe agreed but he said, “there is no law like that And the Narmada is a holy river for Hindus: it will cause trouble if we prevent people. They will say they are going to take a bath – and this is a religious thing, so don’t get me into trouble.”\nI told Thakur, “Five o’clock will be the right time, so I am fixing the alarm for four o’clock. It takes one hour to get from here to the marble rocks.” So in my room, on a table between our beds, I put the clock. Thakur was tossing and turning; I said, “what is the matter? You don’t feel like sleeping? – because this is the last night. Have a good sleep. You will never be able to sleep again, so just sleep.”\nHe said, “Are you my friend?”\nI said, “Yes, certainly, Thakoor, I am your friend.”\nHe said, “You are so interested in my suicide and you are making every arrangement: I wonder whether you are my friend or my enemy.”\nI said, “I am just your friend. You want to die – I am ready to help. If you want to live, I am ready to help. A friend is really known when a crucial moment comes, and this is such a moment. You are going to die – at least I can help you.” I brought the car to the porch, and I said, “In the morning somebody may get up late, so it is better if I go to the gas station to fin it up now; in the morning, at four o’clock, it may be difficult. We may not find the petrol pump owner, and some problem may arise, so I am making every arrangement.”\nThe more arrangements I made, the more he became afraid of suicide. And at four o’clock when the alarm went off he immediately put his hand on the clock. I caught his hand there and I said, “This is not good, because then we will be late.”\nHe said, “But I am feeling too sleepy.”\nI said, “You can sleep in the car – don’t be worried. And it only takes a few seconds, you have just to jump; if you cannot jump I can push you. And nobody can come alive out from the waterfall in the marble rocks; nobody ever has. Many people have committed suicide there; it is a special place. During examination times there are constables on duty twenty-four hours a day, because nobody can come back alive.\n“The waterfall is big and it falls onto rocks; so when you take a jump the waterfall takes you down deep, perhaps a hundred feet or a hundred and fifty feet down, and then there are rocks all around. You may be smashed on the rocks – nobody who has jumped there has ever come back alive.” So I said, “Don’t be worried: it is sure, guaranteed; there is no problem. Just have a good sleep in the car now.”\nHe sat in the car very reluctantly. On the way he said, “Are you really going to the marble rocks?” I said, “We decided on it.”\nHe said, “Just take me to my home. I don’t want to get married to that girl. To hell with that girl! I became a Bengali for her, and now I am going to commit suicide!”\nI said, “This is strange – you wasted my whole night and all the arrangements I have made. Don’t change your mind – keep to your word.”\nHe said, “You are saying that! It is my life and you are preparing for my death.”\nI said, “If you want I can leave you at your house, but remember, never mention suicide again.”\nHe said, “That I understand. I will certainly not mention suicide to you, nobody should mention it to you: you are dangerous.”\nI said, “I am simply helpful.”\nHe is still alive. He got married to another girl and he has children. The last time I went to Jabalpur in’69, he said, “If I had followed you and committed suicide it would have been better.”\nI said, “I am still ready. You should not mention it to me because if you still want to, there is no problem.”\nHe said, “No, I don’t mean it. I am simply saying that getting married and having children and a job – it is worse than death.”\nI said, “If it is worse, I am still ready to help you.”\nThere are people who are living a life which is worse than death, but they are not courageous enough even to commit suicide. And for transformation more courage is needed than for suicide. For suicide, only a few moments of courage are needed. Just for a few moments you have to keep hold of yourself, and then take a jump or shoot yourself It is just a question of moments. Any coward can be brave enough for a single moment.\nBut transformation is a lifelong process – it is not a question of saving yourself for a few moments\nThis is the reason why people got interested in religions like Christianity, because Christianity sells the idea so cheap. You have not to do anything: no transformation – the word transformation does not even appear in the whole BIBLE – no meditation. The word is not Christian or Jewish. All that you need to do is to believe in the messiah and go every Sunday to church. They can talk about anything, because who listens to these boring preachers there? And because they are boring they cannot conceive that there is a possibility of listening to somebody with deep intimacy and love.\nI saw on television a panel of three priests: one rabbi and two Christians. They discussed many things about me and about my commune – all rumors, there was nothing true in it. One thing they discussed was: “Osho has started speaking and He will be speaking every day now. Won’t people get bored?”\nThree priests... of course that is their experience. They don’t speak every day for three hours continually. They speak only once a week, and not for three hours; otherwise people would kill them. All the three priests are concerned that my people will get bored. They don’t know me, they don’t know my people.\nI have been speaking for thirty years continually, and I have not seen a single person sitting in front of me, bored. That is impossible, because whatever I am saying is not borrowed. I am opening my heart before you, and you are getting bored? That is impossible. I reveal myself to you, and you get bored? That is impossible. But what those three priests were saying had a certain relevance in their experience and so they all agreed that people would get bored.\nThe rabbi even suggested, “We should also start something like this, approaching people – because we have dropped that – talking about truth.” They don’t do that any more because there is no need. Nobody wants to hear, nobody is interested in their God. Even they are not interested.\nI have heard that three rabbis were discussing whose synagogue was the most modern. One said, “In my synagogue women are even allowed to sit side by side with men. Even girlfriends and boyfriends, those who are not married to each other, are allowed to sit together – even people sitting with others’ wives, who I know are committing adultery. But my synagogue is ultra-modern and we move with the times\nThe second one said, “This is nothing, because in my synagogue there is no preaching, no prayer; but a beautiful dinner is served and everybody enjoys it more than the sermon. The real question is enjoyment. With a sermon people get bored. You mention the TORAH, you mention the TALMUD, and they start thinking, How to escape from here? But just because of a delicious dinner everybody from the congregation comes.”\nThe third one said, “This is nothing – my synagogue remains closed on Jewish holidays.”\nThese people have nothing to do with truth; nothing to do with transformation, nothing to do with your personality: they are simply part of a business. These are firms of long, traditional standing. They are all doing business. The question is, whose customer are you? That’s what they mean by saving: “Why are you being saved by somebody else? We can save you in a less costly way, more cheaply, in a more ultra-modern way. We can even keep the synagogues closed on jewish holidays. What more do you want?” They are offering you everything – just be saved by them.\nThat reminds me again of Natthu Kaka. I was a regular visitor to his salon. I had no beard at that time – I was a child – and no mustache, so there was no fear, but I had to use a scarf because I had long hair, and if Natthu Kaka was in the mood he might start cutting. And once he had cut your hair you could not do anything. And he was such a nice man, he would say, “Why be worried? – you need not pay.” It was, every day, a problem that he had shaved somebody without asking him, and now the man was angry.\nParticularly in India, people shave if they become sannyasins; that means they are dying in a ritualistic way. When a person dies, he is shaved; it is just symbolic. Just as when a person dies he is shaved, in the same way when somebody becomes a traditional sannyasin he is shaved. Or if your father dies, traditionally all the sons will be shaved; but now they have found a little more liberal way – only the eldest son has to be shaved. So to shave somebody’s complete head without asking him.… And Natthu Kakka was really a craftsman: with just one hand half of your skull was shaved dean. Now there was no way except to let him shave your whole head, because with it only half shaven you would look more of an idiot than with it totally shaven.\nSo it was every day a question of a fight: people would get angry and would be ready toAnd\nI enjoyed the scene. Natthu Kaka’s shop was just in front of my father’s shop so whenever there was something happening I would immediately go there. But I kept my scarf in Natthu Kaka’s place itself because sometimes I might be coming by and just see some great thing happening there – somebody ready to hit Natthu Kaka, and him saying, “You are getting unnecessarily upset. I am an old man, an opium addict. I don’t know whom I am shaving and what is happening – it is all mixed up. Somehow you got into my hands, and it is just an old habit to shave people, sol did it.\nSo I used to keep my scarf there: the first thing I would do is put on my scarf One day he shaved a man who was a kind of political leader. Of course the man was very angry and he said, “You have to be punished for this. I am going to the police, I am going to the court.”\nI was there. I said, “There is no need to be angry, and even by going to the police and to the court your hair will not be replaced. This poor man is not even asking money from you. And as far as your hair is concerned.” This man was an educated man, and I used to have discussions with him.\nSo I told him, “You remember the Zen haiku: ‘Sitting silently, doing nothing, and the grass grows by itself’? Why be so worried? Just take out ‘grass’ and put in ‘hair.’”\nThat day an idea came to me. I made a small board and put it in Natthu Kaka’s shop. Natthu Kaka is dead but perhaps still there in his shop will be the board on which I wrote the haiku, with a note: “If Natthu Kaka shaves somebody, don’t get angry with him; he is just an old savior. And if he has shaved you, please meditate on this haiku:‘Sitting silently, doing nothing, the hair grows by itself’ The hair will grow – don’t be worried.”\nPerhaps that board is still there, or perhaps the shop is finished, because his sons were not interested in doing business with him. They were trying to find employment, because, they said, “With this old man we will lose business because we are not opium addicts. People forgive him because everybody comes running from all the shops around here saying, ‘Don’t be angry – he is a nice fellow.’”\nWhen last I went to my village – that was in’70 – he was still alive but very old. I went to see him and he said, “Since you have left for your studies, nobody comes regularly the way you used to come, and nobody is there to help this old opium addict. I go on doing my thing – I can’t help it.” He would sometimes catch hold of children and shave them, and then their fathers would come and say, “What have you done?” And his only answer was, “I don’t ask for any money, can’t I even practice? Where am I supposed to practice? No customers are coming and I am sitting without doing anything.”\nIn 1970 he told me, “You are the only person who can help me” – because in my childhood there was no legal prohibition on opium or any drugs; everything was available in the market. Only the person who was selling needed a license that cost five rupees per year; the people who were purchasing were not required to have any license or anything. But in 1970 when I went there, things had changed. All drugs were prohibited; and the old addicts, like Natthu Kaka, were given licenses so that they could get a little quantity every day. He was very angry.\nHe said, “Only you can help, because I know how many people are opium addicts in the whole country. If you lead us, and if all the opium addicts become united, we can turn over this government.”\nI said, “Great, Natthu! You want me to become the leader of the opium addicts?”\nHe said, “I don’t know anybody who would be as understanding as you.”\nI said, “The idea is good, but to collect all opium addicts and to persuade them to make a party and overturn the government is a very difficult job. I would have to do everything alone. Your opium addicts would create trouble rather than be any help! Just drop this political act – this is not for opium addicts.”\nHe said, “Think about it, because you go around the country: you can just tell all the opium addicts that this is simply unjust. I have lived my whole life with opium and I have not harmed anybody – except that once in a while I shave people, but I don’t take any money. I have not done any crime; in fact I don’t have any energy to do any crime, I am just enjoying my opium. My opium has made me so simple and so innocent that people come and milk my cow and I go on seeing what they are doing, but only later on I remember that it was my cow, that they were milking my cow and they have taken the milk.\n“I have not committed any crime; on the contrary people have been committing crimes against me. They take soap from my shop, they take mirrors from my shop – and I am sitting there! But I am enjoying my own world. So I don’t see what is the point in prohibiting opium. You can prohibit any other drug – I am not concerned – but opium simply makes a man a gentleman.”\nI said, “It is true, Natthu Kaka, but it will be very difficult. I will TRY.…” And I actually told Indira Gandhi the whole story.\nShe laughed, and she said, “He is, in a way, right, that opium addicts don’t create any trouble.” Opium simply makes them hallucinate, and opium is a drug which makes you very happy, it never makes you depressed; all other drugs have that possibility. Sometimes if your mood is depressed and you take LSD, that will depress you more; if your mood is happy and you take LSD, it will raise your happiness. It depends on your mood: the drug only exaggerates your mood.\nOpium does not work that way. It simply relaxes you and helps you to hallucinate beautiful things, nice things. It never gives you any nightmares, because this Natthu Kaka and his friends – I have talked to all of them – never had any nightmares with opium.\nSo Indira told me, “What he is saying is right, but to collect these opium addicts will be difficult for you; and to overturn the government with their support – it will be really a revolution if it becomes possible.”\nThis idea of saving is deeply insulting and humiliating to people.\nThe moment you say, “I would like to save you,” you are reducing that person to a subhuman being: You are a savior and he is just to be saved.\nIt is ugly, it is just sick.\nIt is not compassion.\nCompassion shares.\nAnd if somebody is available and open he absorbs it.\nBut the credit never goes to you; you cannot claim, “I have saved you.” The person saves himself:\nThat’s the only way, there is no other way. The second question?\nQuestion 2 OSHO,\nI HAVE HEARD YOU SAY THAT YOU ARE NOT HERE TO INSPIRE ANYBODY HOWEVER, THE FACT IS THAT I COME AWAY FROM YOUR RECENT DISCOURSES TOTALLY AFIRE AND IGNITED BY WHATEVER IT IS THAT HAPPENS BETWEEN YOU AND US. PLEASE COMMENT.\nYES, I am not here to inspire. But you are here to be inspired. These are two different things.\nIf you get inspired the credit goes to you. It is not me who is inspiring you, it is you who are open to me. If you bring your candle close to me and it becomes lighted, is it my flame that is responsible or is it you coming closer to me, bringing your unlighted candle? I don’t move a single inch towards your candle, because that I consider a trespass.\nI open myself completely to you.\nI make my candle available to you. You can bring your candle.\nIt is just as when a thirsty man comes to the well:\nIf he drinks and his thirst is quenched, all credit goes to him. In fact the well feels grateful, thankful to him because as more water is taken out of the well, fresh water goes on flowing into the well. If people stop drinking from the well and drawing water from the well, the water dies. Its inner sources become closed; soon the well becomes poisonous.\nIf a man of enlightenment remains closed – which is impossible, I am just saying it for argument’s sake – if a man of enlightenment remains closed he will destroy his enlightenment. But it is impossible. Enlightenment becomes enlightenment only because he opens up. And he goes on opening – there is no end to his opening.\nAll that he is, is only a presence. That’s why I say I don’t do anything. I am just here for you to do something. You can come close to me. That’s what happens when I am talking to you: unawares,\nyou start moving closer to me. Your physical bodies remain where they are – and leave them there! – but you start moving towards me. Perhaps you will understand what I am saying, because I can see – when somebody starts moving towards me, I can see – the body is left behind and the person has come very close to me. It is in that moment you feel afire, ignited. But the whole credit always goes to you.\nI am not the savior.\nAnd I do not want ever to be known, by that ugly word, savior.

IS IT NOT PART OF
COMPASSION?</p><p><br></p><p>COMPASSION is a very delicate affair. It certainly has some place in
making an effort to save others, but there are many conditions which
have to be fulfilled first.</p><p><br></p><p>The first condition is that you are saved; otherwise, in the name of
saving others you will be simply destroying them. And in the effort of
saving others you will be missing the opportunity to save yourself Only
a person who has come home himself can be of any help to somebody. A
blind man cannot help blind people. You must have your eyes opened; you
must have seen light yourself before you start telling others what it
is.</p><p><br></p><p>Compassion certainly includes the idea of saving others, but not
against their will. If somebody does not want to be saved, you are not
to force him; not at the point of a sword do you have to save him. That
is not saving. That simply shows that in the name of saving you are
trying to dominate people.</p><p><br></p><p>In Raipur there is an old, very ancient pond. Because of its
ancientness it is called budha talub – old, aged, pond, and it belongs
to the part of Raipur which is the ancientmost part. That part is also
called budha padu – ancient part, very old; budha means old man. And the
pond is certainly very beautiful in its oldness; all the old stone steps
are covered with thick moss.</p><p>I used to go there just to sit because nobody goes there. The pond
has become dirty; thick moss floats on the water and the water is almost
green. The pond has not been cleaned for years, so nobody goes there.
And there are other ponds in other places, so there is no need; the
water is not used any more. And because it was such a silent place I
used to go there every evening to sit and see the sunset.</p><p><br></p><p>One day when I was sitting there a man suddenly fell into the pond
and started shouting, “help! Help!” I had not seen him when he came by,
or how he slipped. Anybody could have slipped, those steps were so
slippery with moss. I jumped in to help that man and I pulled him out
somehow. He was very angry.</p><p><br></p><p>He said to me, “Why did you do that?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “This is strange! You were asking for help.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Yes, I was asking for help because I became so afraid, but
really I wanted to commit suicide – and you prevented me. I would not
have shouted if I had any idea that somebody else was present here;
nobody comes here. What are you doing here?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “This is strange, but when you started shouting,‘Help! Help!’
I thought you were drowning. I have unnecessarily become wet in this
muddy pond and you are now angry.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Yes, I am certainly angry because that shout was just out
of fear. I was not meaning to be saved.”</p><p><br></p><p>So do you know what I did? I simply pushed him back in. What else to
do? And he started shouting again, “Help! Help!”</p><p><br></p><p>And I said, “Now I am not going to help. I have helped twice: the
first time by getting you out; the second, by pushing you back in. Now
do whatsoever you want.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “What kind of man are you?” And he was drowning – coming up
and going down, and crying, “Help!”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Not against your will.</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I am saying HELP” – but I simply sat there.</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “You try yourself” He was not far away from the bank because
I had just pulled him out, he was just close, so it was perfectly clear
that he would manage. And he did manage. He got a little water inside
him but he came out and said, “You are a strange man.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I am a strange man? You are a strange man! First I saved
you; you were angry. Then I helped you by throwing you back in; you were
angry again, and started crying out for help.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Yes, when I get into water I become afraid of death, but
really I want to commit suicide.”</p><p>I said, “Then you come at some other time because at this time I am
always here, and if you start shouting’Help!’ then it looks very strange
not to help. But I cannot help you against your will.</p><p><br></p><p>Compassion cannot allow you even to do good to the other person if he
is not ready for it. Compassion gives total freedom, respect and dignity
to the other person.</p><p>All these people who have been trying to save others are just a
by-product of Christianity and its conditioning.</p><p><br></p><p>In Buddhism there is no place for saving anybody. Buddha says, “I can
show you the way, but you will have to walk. I cannot walk for you. And
if you don’t want to walk, who am I to force you to walk? At the most I
can say I have walked the path, and the beauties of the path I can
describe, but I cannot force you in any way. That will not be
compassion, that will be cruelty. If it is your pleasure to go some
other way, then all my blessings are with you. Even if you are going to
hell, my blessings are with you.”</p><p><br></p><p>Mahavira has taken a very clear stand: “Nobody has ever been saved by
anybody else. It is by its very nature not possible, because if somebody
can save you, then somebody can unsave you also. Then your being saved
is not something in your possession, it is given by somebody. It is just
like somebody can give you money and somebody else can steal it – you
are not the master of it. And at least your self-realization, your
enlightenment, must be something of which you are the master, which
nobody can deprive you of.</p><p><br></p><p>“It is simple logic: if somebody can give it to you, then somebody
can deprive you of it; there is no problem in it. If you can be forced
to be enlightened, you can be forced to be unenlightened.”</p><p><br></p><p>Mahavira is very clear, and I agree with him, that at least one
ultimate thing should be left to the individual. And enlightenment is
the ultimate experience. It should not be borrowed, given, purchased,
forced; otherwise it won’t be the real thing.</p><p><br></p><p>It is the Christian stupidity that has spread the idea; no other
religion before Christianity had ever thought of saving somebody. If you
know the way, you know the joys of the way; you can sing the song, you
can dance the dance. If somebody feels like moving with you, being a
fellow traveler, not a follower, then he is welcome. But there is no
enforcement and you are not obliging him.</p><p><br></p><p>These are the beautiful points which have arisen in the Eastern
consciousness over thousands of years, that even if you show the way,
you give the details of the path and you give the discipline, you don’t
make the other person feel obliged to you. You are not doing it for him;
it is just your own experience which wants to be shared. He is obliging
you by hearing you, by giving you a chance to share your experience. He
is helping you to be unburdened of the fragrance that you are carrying –
and you want to be unburdened; you have to be thankful to the person –
the question of saving does not arise.</p><p><br></p><p>But after Christianity it became an almost universal phenomenon.
After Christianity came Mohammedanism, and of course they went to the
very logical end: either you have to be ready to be saved or be ready to
die. They don’t give you any other choice, because they believe that
if</p><p>you go on living unsaved you may commit sins and you will suffer in
hell. By killing you they are at least taking away all the opportunities
of falling into hell.</p><p><br></p><p>And to be killed by a savior is almost to be saved. That’s what
Mohammedans have been saying, that if you kill somebody in order to save
him, he is saved; God will look after it. He is saved and you are
accumulating more virtue in saving so many people. Mohammedans have
killed millions of people in the East. And the strange thing is that
they believed they were doing the right thing. And whenever somebody
does a wrong thing believing that it is right, then it is more
dangerous. You cannot persuade him otherwise, he does not give you a
chance to be persuaded. In India I tried in every possible way to
approach Mohammedan scholars, but they are unapproachable. They don’t
want to discuss any religious matter with somebody who is not a
Mohammedan.</p><p><br></p><p>They have a word of condemnation for the person who is not a
Mohammedan. Just as Christians call him a heretic, Mohammedans call him
kaffir – which is even worse than heretic. Kaffir comes from a word,
kufr; kufr means sin, a sinner. Kaffir means a sinner: anybody who is
not a Mohammedan is a sinner. There are no other categories, only two
categories. Either you are a Mohammedan, then you are a saint.<span class=s4></span>Just by being a Mohammedan you are a saint, you are
saved, because you believe in</p><p>one God, one prophet – mohammed – and one holy book, the KORAN. These
three things believed is enough for you to be a saint. And those who are
not Mohammedans are all kaffirs, sinners.</p><p><br></p><p>It is a strange fact that India has the greatest population of
Mohammedans – even today, after Pakistan was divided from India. Before
the division, certainly India was the biggest Mohammedan country in the
world. With Pakistan, it was hoped that now Mohammedans were going to
have their own country. They got a great portion of the country,
according to their population, but all the Mohammedans did not move to
Pakistan. All the Hindus in Pakistan were killed, so Pakistan is purely
a Mohammedan country. But the Mohammedans who did not move to Pakistan
and who remain in India are still more in numbers than in any other
country in the world, Pakistan included.</p><p><br></p><p>India, although a Hindu country, has the biggest number of
Mohammedans. Still it is impossible to communicate. I have tried my
best, but if you are not a Mohammedan then how can you understand? There
is no question of any dialogue: you are a kaffir.</p><p><br></p><p>I had a professor as my colleague in the university, who loved me
very much. He was a Mohammedan. I asked him, “Farid, can’t you
manage<span class=s4></span>?” Because Jabalpur is one of the big
centers</p><p>of Mohammedans and it has great scholars. One very famous scholar,
Burhanuddin, was there. He was old, and famous all over India and
outside India also as a scholar of Mohammedanism. I asked Farid, “Find
some way for me to have a dialogue with him.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Ft is really difficult – unless you can pretend to be a
Mohammedan.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “That too is very difficult, because then you have to teach
me a few basic things of Mohammedanism – their prayer and what they do.
And moreover that Burhanuddin knows me – we have spoken many times from
the same platform – so it will be very difficult for me to act. I can
try, there is no harm. At the most we may get caught and we can laugh at
the whole thing.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “You can laugh, but my position will be very bad. They will
kill me because you are a Mohammedan and you are supporting a kaffir,
and deceiving one of your great masters.” But he was</p><p>willing to do it. He started teaching me the language, Urdu. It was
difficult to learn because it is just absolutely the opposite of any
language that is born of Sanskrit. An Urdu book starts from the back and
the sentence starts from the right corner and goes towards the left.</p><p><br></p><p>It is so difficult to get adjusted: it is just upside down, the whole
thing. You have to open the book from the end; that is the beginning.
And then the sentence starts from the right and moves towards the left.
And because of the way the Urdu language is written a perfect way has
not yet been found to print it or type it. The way it is written is not
scientific at all; most of it has to be guessed. So those who are
accustomed to read it, they can read it because they can guess what it
will be. But for somebody who is learning, it is very difficult to
guess.</p><p><br></p><p>But for six months I tried. I learned enough so that I could deceive
somebody into thinking that I was not very educated, but a little bit. I
learned their prayers; Farid managed to get a wig for me and cut my
beard like the Mohammedans cut theirs. And their beard is so strange
that even when I think of it again now my stomach starts churning. But I
went through it; they cut my mustache off completely and left just my
beard.</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “my God” If you had told me before then I would not have
wasted these six months!” In a way they were right, because I know that
a mustache is such a difficult thing – particularly a mustache like mine
which is not trimmed but is wild. I don’t allow Mukta to trim it. It is
difficult even to drink tea or to drink fruit juice because half of it
will remain on the mustache. So Mohammedans have found a way: they cut
off the mustache, they shave the mustache, and they keep the beard. But
that looks so ugly.</p><p><br></p><p>But I said, “Okay, we will do it. Now, for a few days I will not
leave my house. Just give me a wig and let me see Burhanuddin.” It
certainly changed my face completely when Farid cut my beard like the
Mohammedans’ – very thin along the jawline and just a little bit of
beard on the chin – like Lenin’s, a little less. Without a mustache and
with a wig I looked different.</p><p><br></p><p>We went there, but the old man detected something about my eyes. He
said, “I have seen those eyes somewhere.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “My God! Farid, where could Maulana” – Maulana means master;
he was known as Maulana Burhanuddin – “have seen me? – because I have
never been to this city.”</p><p><br></p><p>Farid was trembling, he was having a nervous breakdown: we had never
thought about the eyes. That old man continued to look, and he said, “I
suspect something.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Farid, he suspects something.” Farid just fell at his feet
and he said, “There is no need to suspect – you know this man. And
forgive me, I was just trying to help him because he wanted to have a
dialogue with you.”</p><p><br></p><p>But he said, “First tell me who he is, because as far as I can
remember, I have known the man and I have seen him many times. You have
just cut off his mustache.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said; ’Now it is better, Farid, that you tell the whole thing, that
not only have you cut off my mustache<span class=s4></span>” I took
off the wig and I said, “Look at the wig.”</p><p>The moment I was without the wig, Burhanuddin immediately recognized
me, and he said, “YOU!</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “What else to do? You know me perfectly but you will not have
a personal talk with me. Do you think that just being a Mohammedan is
enough to be a saint? And what sin have I committed?</p><p><br></p><p>“Certainly I am not a Mohammedan, but Mohammed himself was not a
Mohammedan when he was born. Was he a kaffir, a sinner? And can you tell
me who converted Mohammed to Islam? He was never converted. Just as
Jesus remained a Jew, Mohammed remained a pagan all his life;
Mohammedanism is something that started after his death. So if Mohammed,
a kaffir, can become the messenger of God, can’t I discuss the
message?”</p><p><br></p><p>Burhanuddin said, “This is what I was afraid of That s why we don’t
encourage any dialogue between Mohammedans and non-Mohammedans.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “That simply shows your weakness. What is the fear? I am
opening myself to you, to be saved by you. Save me – and if you cannot
save me then let me try to save you.”</p><p><br></p><p>But that man simply turned towards Farid and said, “Take him away – I
don’t want to talk any more. And you have to come tomorrow to see
me.”</p><p><br></p><p>And Farid was punished, beaten. I could not believe it: he was a
professor at the university, a well- known scholar who was a guide to
many research students working on Mohammedanism, on Urdu literature, the
KORAN. Burhanuddin had a few hooligans there – they gave Farid a good
beating. He showed me his body; all over his body were signatures of the
Mohammedan attitude.</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I told you before, that if something goes wrong.<span class=s4></span>They have only beaten me because I</p><p>am a well-known person – if I were somebody else they would have
killed me.”</p><p><br></p><p>From Christianity the stupidity has moved to Mohammedanism. But
except for these two religions no religion believes that you can save
anybody; and in fact those other religions know more about compassion
than these two religions. This idea of being a savior is simply
illogical. Try to understand it.</p><p><br></p><p>You have been living for many lives; you have been doing things on
your own. Now it is your responsibility to undo all that. How can I undo
it? I have not done it, I have never been a partner with you in doing
it. You have lived an absolutely free, individual life for many lives,
and according to that you have grown and come to this stage where you
are. This is not accidental, this is the growth of a long, long process.
Now to undo that process you will have to take great responsibility on
yourself I can show you the way I have undone my process. Certainly, the
same method will help you to undo your process – perhaps with a little
modification here and there. That you have to work out.</p><p><br></p><p>You can work it out with me, but that is going to be a dialogue, not
dictation. I cannot dictate to you, aDo this,” and give you a simple
panacea so that you will be saved: “believe in me and you are saved.”
Then not believing in me would be the only problem. Do you think that is
the only problem, not believing in me? If that is the only problem then
certainly in believing in me the problem is solved, you are saved. But
that is not the problem. In your believing in me, your anger will still
remain anger, your greed will still remain greed, your jealousy will
still remain jealousy.</p><p>Believing in me or Jesus or Mohammed is not going to change
anything.</p><p><br></p><p>Do you think people who believe in Jesus are different in any way
from people who don’t believe in Jesus, who believe in Mohammed, who
believe in somebody else? No, they are not different. Deep down they are
the same people, with the same jealousy, with the same arrogance, the
same egoism, same violence. Everything is the same, all the garbage is
the same.</p><p><br></p><p>Believing changes nothing at all, so how can you be saved? The whole
idea is idiotic.</p><p><br></p><p>Mahavira and Buddha are far more sophisticated than Jesus and
Mohammed. One of my arguments with Jaina monks began with this same
question. Mahavira says: “Nobody can save anybody except himself.
Everybody has to save himself.” Buddha says: “Be a light unto yourself”
That was his last message before he died.</p><p><br></p><p>When Buddha was dying his closest disciple, Ananda, started crying.
Thousands of disciples were there, at least ten thousand disciples were
there. They were all ready to burst into tears, but they were holding
back their tears somehow because Buddha would not like it: “At least
while he is going beyond our reach let him go feeling that his disciples
have followed his message.”</p><p><br></p><p>But Ananda could not contain himself. It was difficult for everybody,
but for Ananda it was more difficult because for at least sixty years he
had been like a shadow to Buddha, serving him in every possible way
without asking anything in return. It was just a sheer joy to serve him
and to sit silently while he was talking to others, answering others.
Ananda would never interrupt. It is very difficult to find such a
devoted person.</p><p><br></p><p>He was Buddha’s elder brother, his cousin-brother; he was older than
Buddha. Before he was initiated into sannyas Ananda had asked Buddha
three things. He said, “After being initiated I will be your disciple;
whatsoever you say there is no question, I have to do it, and I will do
it. But right now I am still your elder brother, so as an elder brother
promise me three things and then initiate me, because after that I will
never be able to ask anything.” He asked three things, but he never used
a single promise.</p><p><br></p><p>One was: “you will not say to me,‘Ananda, you go somewhere else to
spread the word.’ I am going to remain with you to serve you. You have
to promise me.” The second was: “Even if in the middle of the night I
bring somebody who needs your help, you cannot refuse them. Anybody whom
I bring to you, you have to help; whether you are tired after the whole
day’s work or not, it doesn’t matter. If I bring somebody to you, you
have to help him, you cannot refuse.”</p><p><br></p><p>And the third was: “If I ask a question, you cannot tell me, as you
tell others,‘Be silent for two years, three years, meditate, and then I
will answer.’ No, you will have to answer immediately.” As his younger
brother, Buddha promised Ananda that these three things would be granted
to him.</p><p><br></p><p>But Ananda was a rare man; otherwise, Buddha would have hesitated to
accept these conditions, because initiation cannot be given in a
conditional way. He could have simply said, “If you put conditions on me
then initiation is not possible” – because many other times a few other
people had come with conditions and he had refused them; but to Ananda
he gave the promise. That is unprecedented in the whole history of
initiation. But I can understand why he did it; he knew Ananda</p><p>from his childhood – he was not a man to take advantage of anything.
Buddha knew that Ananda would never use those promises – he could be
given them.</p><p><br></p><p>And Ananda never used them. He never asked a single question, he
never brought a single person; and of course, Buddha never told him to
go away. If Buddha had said to, Ananda would have gone-he would not have
even mentioned the promise-but Buddha never asked him.</p><p><br></p><p>This man could not contain himself: sixty years was so long to be
together. He had been just like a shadow-and now he was left alone.
Tears came to his eyes. Buddha opened his eyes to look, to have a last
look at his disciples. Seeing tears in Ananda’s eyes he said, “Ananda,
be a light unto yourself I was not your light, and I was not your
savior. My death makes no difference. In fact, now you will have to
understand what I have been telling you for sixty years: don’t remain in
any illusion that just because you are serving me and you are being with
me devotedly – it is very difficult to find such a devotion – still that
is not going to save you.”</p><p><br></p><p>You have to go through a transformation. And that only you can
do.</p><p>It is such an inner work that even the Master cannot reach there.
Except for you, nobody can reach there.</p><p>And this is the beauty of the human soul:</p><p><br></p><p>It is absolutely unavailable to anybody. Your center is so protected
by existence:</p><p>Nobody can even touch it.</p><p><br></p><p>The question of saving somebody does not arise. Yes, the man of
compassion tries his best to explain to you the way, to explain to you
how it has happened to him. But that is simply sharing his story with
you. Perhaps out of that story you can get some hints for yourself, but
that is up to you.</p><p><br></p><p>In these twenty-five centuries since Mahavira and Buddha, Buddhism
has completely disappeared from India because Buddhist monks could not
compromise with Hinduism in any way. And I think that it is perfectly
right: there is no need to compromise with anybody. Rather than
compromising they preferred either to be killed, burned, or to leave the
country. So a very strange thing happened: Buddhism was born in India,
Buddha was born in India, and yet in India there are no Buddhists. And
there was a time when the whole of India was afire with Buddhism. Either
they had to die... but not a single Buddhist is known to have been
converted, it is impossible. If you have understood something how can
somebody else convert you?</p><p><br></p><p>They left the country and spread all over Asia, so the whole of Asia
turned to Buddhism. Except for India the whole continent is Buddhist.
Buddhists from all over Asia come to India to pay homage to the place
where Buddha had become enlightened. The temple that was made as a
memorial</p><p>for Buddha’s enlightenment has a brahmin priest because Buddhists
disappeared from India so totally that even to find a priest.<span class=s4></span>For the memorial temple of Buddha’s enlightenment
there was no</p><p>Buddhist available. And a brahmin.<span class=s4></span>Buddha’s
whole revolution is against brahminism.</p><p><br></p><p>But brahmins are professional priests. You can tell them anything,
you pay for it, and they will be the priest – it doesn’t matter. And to
them it really doesn’t matter because Hinduism has thirty-three million
gods. When you can worship thirty-three million gods, one or two more
makes no difference. And they are not getting involved in your religion:
just purely as professionals they perform the worship.</p><p><br></p><p>I have talked with this brahmin priest who is worshipping in Buddha’s
temple, just as a heritage. For centuries his family has been
worshipping there; they are almost the owners of the place. I asked him,
“Are you influenced in any way by Buddha?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “The question does not arise – we are professional priests.
Somebody is a professional doctor, somebody is a professional engineer;
that does not mean that becomes his religion. My religion is Hinduism
and I go to the Hindu temple to worship for myself. This is simply a
paid job. I am being paid; and I go on receiving many gifts because
visitors come from all the Buddhist countries – Sri Lanka, Japan,
Vietnam, Indonesia, Indo-China, China, Korea, Taipei, the whole of Asia.
So many gifts go on coming to me, it is a really profitable job, but I
am a brahmin and I am against Buddhism.”</p><p><br></p><p>Buddhists disappeared because they did not compromise, and Jainism
remained a small stream because it did compromise. It was one of the
questions of debate for me all over India when meeting Jaina monks or
meeting them on a stage in some conference. They would all say,
“Mahavira was born to redeem the whole of mankind from sin.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “This is absolutely wrong – you are just put ting Mahavira’s
name in place of Jesus Christ. It is a Christian influence, it is not at
all in tune with Mahavira. He was not born to redeem the whole world,
and if he was, the proof is there that the world is not redeemed. Nor
has Jesus’ crucifixion redeemed the world. Nobody has been able to
redeem the world – it is nobody’s business to. If you can redeem
yourself, that is more than enough. And if you can spread a little bit
of light and fragrance around you, you are fortunate and blessed.”</p><p><br></p><p>Saving somebody is really a thankless job – you know, the way I saved
the man in that ancient pond in Raipur. He was shouting, “Help! Help!”
but he could not believe it when I pushed him back. When he came out he
said, “The first time it was okay because I was shouting,‘Help! Help!’ –
but I was just standing there and you pushed me?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I was simply undoing what I had done, because it was wrong,
against your will. If you want to commit suicide all my blessings are
with you. If just a little push is needed, I am not so miserly that I
won’t give it to you.”</p><p><br></p><p>It happened when I was a student that I had a friend who was in love
with a Bengali girl. He was not a Bengali, but he was really a fanatic
lover. He almost transformed himself into a Bengali; he even started
speaking Hindi the way Bengalis speak. It was impossible to detect that
he was not a Bengali because he was speaking Bengali very perfectly.
That can be understood; but he started speaking Hindi which was his
mother tongue, the way Bengalis speak it – and Bengalis destroy it!</p><p>He learned that too just to influence that girl and her parents, to
show that although he was not a born Bengali, he was almost a Bengali.
He started dressing himself the Bengali way and he started carrying an
umbrella, which Bengalis always do – I don’t know why. If it is raining
it is okay, if it is hot it is okay; but no matter whether it is raining
or not, hot or not, cold or not, an umbrella is always with them. It is
a multipurpose thing: to drive dogs away, to beat somebody or to fight
with somebody. It has many purposes and is always handy. It has just
become part of the Bengali personality – so he started carrying an
umbrella.</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Thakur” – he was by caste a Thakur.</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “You are my friend, but don’t call me Thakur, call
me’Thakoor’ the way Bengalis say it”the “u” in Thakur becomes “o”:
Thakoor – “otherwise our friendship is finished.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I am not a Bengali and it looks so foolish to call you
Thakoor; I will be unnecessarily wasting my breath. Thakur is perfectly
good.”</p><p><br></p><p>But the family refused him, because Bengalis are very arrogant in
that matter. They are just like French people in Europe. They think
their language is the best and their culture is the best. Even if a
Frenchman understands English he won’t speak it, he will speak in
French. He cannot fall down so low and just speak English. Bengalis do
the same: they can speak Hindi but they won’t.</p><p><br></p><p>I have been visiting Calcutta hundreds of times but only
Hindi-speaking people would come to listen to me. Even in Calcutta –
which is the capital for Bengalis – not a single Bengali would turn up
for a meeting. I had a few friends who would come to see me, and I asked
them, “Why don’t you come to the meetings?</p><p><br></p><p>They said, “Unless you start speaking in Bengali, no Bengali is going
to come.”</p><p><br></p><p>You will be surprised that in Calcutta they call everybody who is
outside Bengal an Indian. They are Bengalis, and everybody, except them,
is an Indian. That was strange to know. For the first time I came to
know in Bengal that I am Indian and they are Bengalis.</p><p><br></p><p>So the family refused Thakur. They said, “You may speak Bengali, you
may even speak Hindi the way Bengalis speak, you may carry an umbrella;
you have managed everything well.…” The boy started eating fish and
rice, because that is the most important food for Bengalis – rice and
fish. He would not eat any other sweets than Bengali sweets. He was
really a Majnu, a Farhad, a Romeo – that kind of person.</p><p><br></p><p>But the family refused him, they said, “We won’t accept you.” But he
was not going to take any no from them. He closed himself in his room
and his family all tried to persuade him to open the door.</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I am not going to open the door. I am going to die in this
room unless you go and persuade that family. Either I have to marry
their daughter or I am going to die.”</p><p><br></p><p>Now the family said, “How can we persuade them? Those people don’t
even consider themselves Indians. You have become almost a Bengali.”</p><p>“If they have refused you,” the father said, “they will not even talk
to me because that’s far below them. Bengalis have culture, they have
great poets and great scientists and everything great. They won’t listen
to me.”</p><p><br></p><p>Still, he went – what else to do? Thakur was his only son, and he was
being so foolish that he wouldn’t open the door. The father went. He was
a well-known doctor, but the family said, “We are sorry, but we cannot
give our daughter to an Indian family. You will not be able to give her
the comforts, the food, the culture, that she is accustomed to, so it is
not going to happen. Just persuade your son.”</p><p><br></p><p>The trouble was that the girl was not interested, otherwise I would
have managed something. I told the boy, “It is not a problem of being a
Bengali or a non-bengali. I would have managed something if the girl was
interested in you, but she is not interested at all; otherwise you could
have eloped. I would have managed it.”</p><p><br></p><p>I had done it two or three times in my life. I had even arranged for
my own brother to elope with a girl, because my younger brother fell in
love with the daughter of the landlord of the house where I used to
live.</p><p><br></p><p>My landlord was furious, but I said, “Don’t be worried; I will
persuade my brother when he comes next” – because he was studying in the
engineering college, so he came whenever he had time; the engineering
college was almost ten miles away from the place – “whenever he comes I
will explain things to him. Don’t be worried.”</p><p><br></p><p>Meanwhile I asked his daughter, “what do you want? If you are really
willing then tomorrow you both escape – I will arrange everything. He is
madly in love with you but the question is, are you in love with
him?”</p><p><br></p><p>She said, “I am more madly in love with him than he is with me.”</p><p><br></p><p>So I said, “Then it is perfect.” I arranged a magistrate, but he was
not willing to perform the marriage in Jabalpur because the legal
procedure is that one month’s notice has to be posted on the court
board:“such and such persons are going to be married. If anybody has any
objection.<span class=s4></span>”</p><p><br></p><p>But one month is a long time; if her father came to know.… I said,
“Do one thing. Post it, back-date it one month tonight. Who will prove
that it was not there for one month? On your notice board there are
hundreds of notices. Just paste it in a corner. It should be there –
back-dated.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “You don’t know law or anything.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “You have to do it. It is not a question of law, it is a
question of love. You have to do it! And I have never asked anything of
you – and I am not asking for myself. But my young brother and this girl
will both suffer their whole life. They will suffer anyway but let them
suffer together! If they want that then it is my duty to help – you just
help too.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said okay. In the night he placed a back-dated notice on the
board, but he was very afraid that something might go wrong, even in the
morning – the court did not open till then. He said, “What I</p><p>will do is this: I will go to a village nearby where I go
occasionally for tours as a magistrate. So you send your brother and the
girl there – nobody will be able to prevent them.”</p><p><br></p><p>So he went away, thirty or forty miles, and stayed in a guesthouse. I
drove my brother and his girlfriend there and got them married – the
magistrate signed and sealed everything. But his fear was right, because
some clerk of his court found that back-dated note. The clerk knew the
girl’s father, so he immediately phoned and said, “Do you know your girl
is going to be married? Today is the last day to register any
objections, and the magistrate is not here, he has gone on tour.”</p><p><br></p><p>The father came running from his shop. I was missing, and the girl
was missing. They went around the whole town; their whole family was
searching to find where we had gone. By the evening we returned. I went
to Delhi; I said to my brother, “I am not coming home for a few days. Go
to my father’s house in the village, don’t go to the girl’s father. Go
to my father’s house; I will phone my father and tell him, ‘I have got
one of your sons married and I am sending him and his wife to you, so
receive them well at the station.’”</p><p><br></p><p>My father said, “You are just a trouble, because you have already
done it without asking me. Now I can’t do anything about it – I will go
to the station and receive them.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Give them a good reception, because the girl’s father is not
going to give any reception. And I will not be there because I don’t
want to be seen with them; otherwise... he is my landlord and he will
throw me out and make me leave the house.”</p><p><br></p><p>After three days I came back. The landlord looked at me and he said,
“Where have you been?” I said, “I went to New Delhi.”</p><p>He said, “Yes, I see you must have gone, but what happened to my
daughter?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I don’t know. What happened to your daughter? I am not your
daughter’s guardian.” So he said, “You don’t know anything?”</p><p>I said, “No, I don’t.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “They got married!”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “This is news to me. Who married them?” Then I persuaded him:
“If they have got married then why make an unnecessary fuss about it?
Give them a good reception. They are already married – you cannot do
anything. Legally she is adult, he is adult; you cannot do anything
legally. And you have showed me the one month’s notice: what were you
doing for one month? And now, when they have got married, you think
about it? Be a little cool. This will be unnecessarily a scandal for
your family. Why make it a scandal? Give them a good reception and say
that this is with our wishes that they have got married.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “It seems right; there is no point in doing otherwise.”</p><p>So I arranged it; I arranged that my father give a good reception to
them. I organized things with the landlord and then I phoned my father,
“Now you can bring the marriage procession to Jabalpur: her father is
willing to give a good reception.”</p><p><br></p><p>So I told Thakur, “I have been arranging marriages – there is no
problem – but the girl simply hates you, it is not just that she does
not love you. Even if she were not in love I would have persuaded her,
talked to her; at least she could feel compassion for you”because for
six years continually he had been trying to become a Bengali, and he had
become one. “But the girl simply hates you; she says it is
impossible!”</p><p><br></p><p>But he would not open the door and he was threatening, “If you do
anything I have poison inside.” He did have poison because he had got
poison from his father’s dispensary. “I will drink it if you force me or
if you try to break down the doors.”</p><p><br></p><p>The father said to me, “Now do something.” I went to the door. I
said, “Listen, Thakoor.”</p><p>He said, “So it is you?” – because he understood, nobody else would
call him Thakoor. I said, “Yes, it is I.”</p><p>He said, “I want to commit suicide.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I will arrange it – just come out with me. Here it will be
difficult: even if you take the poison you are not going to die
immediately. Your father is a doctor; the door can be broken down and
you can be saved from the poison. It is not such a great thing. I found
out from your father that that poison can kill, but it will take at
least eighteen to twenty-fours hours for the man to die. Meanwhile the
poison can be got out or an antidote can be given. So you see, it is
simply foolish. Just come with me; my car is waiting outside, just come
with me.”</p><p><br></p><p>He came out and I took him home. I said, “The best place to die is by
the marble rocks. It is one of the most beautiful places in the world.”
For two continuous miles the Narmada flows between two mountains of
white marble. On the full-moon night it is an absolute dreamland: you
can’t believe that things can be so beautiful. So I said to him, “This
is good; although it is not full-moon night it is very close. In just
two days time it will be full moon. If you can wait for two days, good;
otherwise still it is good light. And you are going to die so what does
it matter whether it is a full-moon night or a no-moon night?</p><p><br></p><p>“I will drive you early in the morning – because that is the best
time. In the night there are people and you may be saved, because when
the moon is there many people go for picnics or for boating, so it is
full. But in the morning there is nobody. It is a night place. In the
day there is no beauty – if you see it in the day you will not believe
it is the same place that you saw in the night... a millionfold
difference.”</p><p><br></p><p>I had actually requested the governor, who was my friend, “Close this
place during the day. Nobody should be allowed to enter to see the
marble rocks then because it destroys the beauty of the marble rocks. It
should be open only when the moon is there, only for a few nights.”</p><p>He agreed but he said, “there is no law like that And the Narmada is
a holy river for Hindus: it will cause trouble if we prevent people.
They will say they are going to take a bath – and this is a religious
thing, so don’t get me into trouble.”</p><p><br></p><p>I told Thakur, “Five o’clock will be the right time, so I am fixing
the alarm for four o’clock. It takes one hour to get from here to the
marble rocks.” So in my room, on a table between our beds, I put the
clock. Thakur was tossing and turning; I said, “what is the matter? You
don’t feel like sleeping? – because this is the last night. Have a good
sleep. You will never be able to sleep again, so just sleep.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Are you my friend?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Yes, certainly, Thakoor, I am your friend.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “You are so interested in my suicide and you are making
every arrangement: I wonder whether you are my friend or my enemy.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I am just your friend. You want to die – I am ready to help.
If you want to live, I am ready to help. A friend is really known when a
crucial moment comes, and this is such a moment. You are going to die –
at least I can help you.” I brought the car to the porch, and I said,
“In the morning somebody may get up late, so it is better if I go to the
gas station to fin it up now; in the morning, at four o’clock, it may be
difficult. We may not find the petrol pump owner, and some problem may
arise, so I am making every arrangement.”</p><p><br></p><p>The more arrangements I made, the more he became afraid of suicide.
And at four o’clock when the alarm went off he immediately put his hand
on the clock. I caught his hand there and I said, “This is not good,
because then we will be late.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “But I am feeling too sleepy.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “You can sleep in the car – don’t be worried. And it only
takes a few seconds, you have just to jump; if you cannot jump I can
push you. And nobody can come alive out from the waterfall in the marble
rocks; nobody ever has. Many people have committed suicide there; it is
a special place. During examination times there are constables on duty
twenty-four hours a day, because nobody can come back alive.</p><p><br></p><p>“The waterfall is big and it falls onto rocks; so when you take a
jump the waterfall takes you down deep, perhaps a hundred feet or a
hundred and fifty feet down, and then there are rocks all around. You
may be smashed on the rocks – nobody who has jumped there has ever come
back alive.” So I said, “Don’t be worried: it is sure, guaranteed; there
is no problem. Just have a good sleep in the car now.”</p><p><br></p><p>He sat in the car very reluctantly. On the way he said, “Are you
really going to the marble rocks?” I said, “We decided on it.”</p><p>He said, “Just take me to my home. I don’t want to get married to
that girl. To hell with that girl! I became a Bengali for her, and now I
am going to commit suicide!”</p><p>I said, “This is strange – you wasted my whole night and all the
arrangements I have made. Don’t change your mind – keep to your
word.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “You are saying that! It is my life and you are preparing
for my death.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “If you want I can leave you at your house, but remember,
never mention suicide again.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “That I understand. I will certainly not mention suicide to
you, nobody should mention it to you: you are dangerous.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I am simply helpful.”</p><p><br></p><p>He is still alive. He got married to another girl and he has
children. The last time I went to Jabalpur in’69, he said, “If I had
followed you and committed suicide it would have been better.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I am still ready. You should not mention it to me because if
you still want to, there is no problem.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “No, I don’t mean it. I am simply saying that getting
married and having children and a job – it is worse than death.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “If it is worse, I am still ready to help you.”</p><p><br></p><p>There are people who are living a life which is worse than death, but
they are not courageous enough even to commit suicide. And for
transformation more courage is needed than for suicide. For suicide,
only a few moments of courage are needed. Just for a few moments you
have to keep hold of yourself, and then take a jump or shoot yourself It
is just a question of moments. Any coward can be brave enough for a
single moment.</p><p><br></p><p>But transformation is a lifelong process – it is not a question of
saving yourself for a few moments</p><p><br></p><p>This is the reason why people got interested in religions like
Christianity, because Christianity sells the idea so cheap. You have not
to do anything: no transformation – the word transformation does not
even appear in the whole BIBLE – no meditation. The word is not
Christian or Jewish. All that you need to do is to believe in the
messiah and go every Sunday to church. They can talk about anything,
because who listens to these boring preachers there? And because they
are boring they cannot conceive that there is a possibility of listening
to somebody with deep intimacy and love.</p><p><br></p><p>I saw on television a panel of three priests: one rabbi and two
Christians. They discussed many things about me and about my commune –
all rumors, there was nothing true in it. One thing they discussed was:
“Osho has started speaking and He will be speaking every day now. Won’t
people get bored?”</p><p><br></p><p>Three priests... of course that is their experience. They don’t speak
every day for three hours continually. They speak only once a week, and
not for three hours; otherwise people would kill them. All the three
priests are concerned that my people will get bored. They don’t know me,
they don’t know my people.</p><p>I have been speaking for thirty years continually, and I have not
seen a single person sitting in front of me, bored. That is impossible,
because whatever I am saying is not borrowed. I am opening my heart
before you, and you are getting bored? That is impossible. I reveal
myself to you, and you get bored? That is impossible. But what those
three priests were saying had a certain relevance in their experience
and so they all agreed that people would get bored.</p><p><br></p><p>The rabbi even suggested, “We should also start something like this,
approaching people – because we have dropped that – talking about
truth.” They don’t do that any more because there is no need. Nobody
wants to hear, nobody is interested in their God. Even they are not
interested.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard that three rabbis were discussing whose synagogue was
the most modern. One said, “In my synagogue women are even allowed to
sit side by side with men. Even girlfriends and boyfriends, those who
are not married to each other, are allowed to sit together – even people
sitting with others’ wives, who I know are committing adultery. But my
synagogue is ultra-modern and we move with the times</p><p><br></p><p>The second one said, “This is nothing, because in my synagogue there
is no preaching, no prayer; but a beautiful dinner is served and
everybody enjoys it more than the sermon. The real question is
enjoyment. With a sermon people get bored. You mention the TORAH, you
mention the TALMUD, and they start thinking, How to escape from here?
But just because of a delicious dinner everybody from the congregation
comes.”</p><p><br></p><p>The third one said, “This is nothing – my synagogue remains closed on
Jewish holidays.”</p><p><br></p><p>These people have nothing to do with truth; nothing to do with
transformation, nothing to do with your personality: they are simply
part of a business. These are firms of long, traditional standing. They
are all doing business. The question is, whose customer are you? That’s
what they mean by saving: “Why are you being saved by somebody else? We
can save you in a less costly way, more cheaply, in a more ultra-modern
way. We can even keep the synagogues closed on jewish holidays. What
more do you want?” They are offering you everything – just be saved by
them.</p><p><br></p><p>That reminds me again of Natthu Kaka. I was a regular visitor to his
salon. I had no beard at that time – I was a child – and no mustache, so
there was no fear, but I had to use a scarf because I had long hair, and
if Natthu Kaka was in the mood he might start cutting. And once he had
cut your hair you could not do anything. And he was such a nice man, he
would say, “Why be worried? – you need not pay.” It was, every day, a
problem that he had shaved somebody without asking him, and now the man
was angry.</p><p><br></p><p>Particularly in India, people shave if they become sannyasins; that
means they are dying in a ritualistic way. When a person dies, he is
shaved; it is just symbolic. Just as when a person dies he is shaved, in
the same way when somebody becomes a traditional sannyasin he is shaved.
Or if your father dies, traditionally all the sons will be shaved; but
now they have found a little more liberal way – only the eldest son has
to be shaved. So to shave somebody’s complete head without asking him.…
And Natthu Kakka was really a craftsman: with just one hand half of your
skull was shaved dean. Now there was no way except to let him shave your
whole head, because with it only half shaven you would look more of an
idiot than with it totally shaven.</p><p>So it was every day a question of a fight: people would get angry and
would be ready to<span class=s4></span>And</p><p>I enjoyed the scene. Natthu Kaka’s shop was just in front of my
father’s shop so whenever there was something happening I would
immediately go there. But I kept my scarf in Natthu Kaka’s place itself
because sometimes I might be coming by and just see some great thing
happening there – somebody ready to hit Natthu Kaka, and him saying,
“You are getting unnecessarily upset. I am an old man, an opium addict.
I don’t know whom I am shaving and what is happening – it is all mixed
up. Somehow you got into my hands, and it is just an old habit to shave
people, sol did it.</p><p><br></p><p>So I used to keep my scarf there: the first thing I would do is put
on my scarf One day he shaved a man who was a kind of political leader.
Of course the man was very angry and he said, “You have to be punished
for this. I am going to the police, I am going to the court.”</p><p><br></p><p>I was there. I said, “There is no need to be angry, and even by going
to the police and to the court your hair will not be replaced. This poor
man is not even asking money from you. And as far as your hair is
concerned.<span class=s4></span>” This man was an educated man, and I
used to have discussions with him.</p><p>So I told him, “You remember the Zen haiku: ‘Sitting silently, doing
nothing, and the grass grows by itself’? Why be so worried? Just take
out ‘grass’ and put in ‘hair.’”</p><p><br></p><p>That day an idea came to me. I made a small board and put it in
Natthu Kaka’s shop. Natthu Kaka is dead but perhaps still there in his
shop will be the board on which I wrote the haiku, with a note: “If
Natthu Kaka shaves somebody, don’t get angry with him; he is just an old
savior. And if he has shaved you, please meditate on this haiku:‘Sitting
silently, doing nothing, the hair grows by itself’ The hair will grow –
don’t be worried.”</p><p><br></p><p>Perhaps that board is still there, or perhaps the shop is finished,
because his sons were not interested in doing business with him. They
were trying to find employment, because, they said, “With this old man
we will lose business because we are not opium addicts. People forgive
him because everybody comes running from all the shops around here
saying, ‘Don’t be angry – he is a nice fellow.’”</p><p><br></p><p>When last I went to my village – that was in’70 – he was still alive
but very old. I went to see him and he said, “Since you have left for
your studies, nobody comes regularly the way you used to come, and
nobody is there to help this old opium addict. I go on doing my thing –
I can’t help it.” He would sometimes catch hold of children and shave
them, and then their fathers would come and say, “What have you done?”
And his only answer was, “I don’t ask for any money, can’t I even
practice? Where am I supposed to practice? No customers are coming and I
am sitting without doing anything.”</p><p><br></p><p>In 1970 he told me, “You are the only person who can help me” –
because in my childhood there was no legal prohibition on opium or any
drugs; everything was available in the market. Only the person who was
selling needed a license that cost five rupees per year; the people who
were purchasing were not required to have any license or anything. But
in 1970 when I went there, things had changed. All drugs were
prohibited; and the old addicts, like Natthu Kaka, were given licenses
so that they could get a little quantity every day. He was very
angry.</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Only you can help, because I know how many people are opium
addicts in the whole country. If you lead us, and if all the opium
addicts become united, we can turn over this government.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Great, Natthu! You want me to become the leader of the opium
addicts?”</p><p>He said, “I don’t know anybody who would be as understanding as
you.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “The idea is good, but to collect all opium addicts and to
persuade them to make a party and overturn the government is a very
difficult job. I would have to do everything alone. Your opium addicts
would create trouble rather than be any help! Just drop this political
act – this is not for opium addicts.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Think about it, because you go around the country: you can
just tell all the opium addicts that this is simply unjust. I have lived
my whole life with opium and I have not harmed anybody – except that
once in a while I shave people, but I don’t take any money. I have not
done any crime; in fact I don’t have any energy to do any crime, I am
just enjoying my opium. My opium has made me so simple and so innocent
that people come and milk my cow and I go on seeing what they are doing,
but only later on I remember that it was my cow, that they were milking
my cow and they have taken the milk.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have not committed any crime; on the contrary people have been
committing crimes against me. They take soap from my shop, they take
mirrors from my shop – and I am sitting there! But I am enjoying my own
world. So I don’t see what is the point in prohibiting opium. You can
prohibit any other drug – I am not concerned – but opium simply makes a
man a gentleman.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “It is true, Natthu Kaka, but it will be very difficult. I
will TRY.…” And I actually told Indira Gandhi the whole story.</p><p><br></p><p>She laughed, and she said, “He is, in a way, right, that opium
addicts don’t create any trouble.” Opium simply makes them hallucinate,
and opium is a drug which makes you very happy, it never makes you
depressed; all other drugs have that possibility. Sometimes if your mood
is depressed and you take LSD, that will depress you more; if your mood
is happy and you take LSD, it will raise your happiness. It depends on
your mood: the drug only exaggerates your mood.</p><p><br></p><p>Opium does not work that way. It simply relaxes you and helps you to
hallucinate beautiful things, nice things. It never gives you any
nightmares, because this Natthu Kaka and his friends – I have talked to
all of them – never had any nightmares with opium.</p><p><br></p><p>So Indira told me, “What he is saying is right, but to collect these
opium addicts will be difficult for you; and to overturn the government
with their support – it will be really a revolution if it becomes
possible.”</p><p><br></p><p>This idea of saving is deeply insulting and humiliating to
people.</p><p><br></p><p>The moment you say, “I would like to save you,” you are reducing that
person to a subhuman being: You are a savior and he is just to be
saved.</p><p>It is ugly, it is just sick.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not compassion.</p><p><br></p><p>Compassion shares.</p><p>And if somebody is available and open he absorbs it.</p><p><br></p><p>But the credit never goes to you; you cannot claim, “I have saved
you.” The person saves himself:</p><p>That’s the only way, there is no other way. The second question?</p><p>Question 2 OSHO,</p><p>I HAVE HEARD YOU SAY THAT YOU ARE NOT HERE TO INSPIRE ANYBODY
HOWEVER, THE FACT IS THAT I COME AWAY FROM YOUR RECENT DISCOURSES
TOTALLY AFIRE AND IGNITED BY WHATEVER IT IS THAT HAPPENS BETWEEN YOU AND
US. PLEASE COMMENT.</p><p><br></p><p>YES, I am not here to inspire. But you are here to be inspired. These
are two different things.</p><p>If you get inspired the credit goes to you. It is not me who is
inspiring you, it is you who are open to me. If you bring your candle
close to me and it becomes lighted, is it my flame that is responsible
or is it you coming closer to me, bringing your unlighted candle? I
don’t move a single inch towards your candle, because that I consider a
trespass.</p><p><br></p><p>I open myself completely to you.</p><p><br></p><p>I make my candle available to you. You can bring your candle.</p><p>It is just as when a thirsty man comes to the well:</p><p><br></p><p>If he drinks and his thirst is quenched, all credit goes to him. In
fact the well feels grateful, thankful to him because as more water is
taken out of the well, fresh water goes on flowing into the well. If
people stop drinking from the well and drawing water from the well, the
water dies. Its inner sources become closed; soon the well becomes
poisonous.</p><p><br></p><p>If a man of enlightenment remains closed – which is impossible, I am
just saying it for argument’s sake – if a man of enlightenment remains
closed he will destroy his enlightenment. But it is impossible.
Enlightenment becomes enlightenment only because he opens up. And he
goes on opening – there is no end to his opening.</p><p><br></p><p>All that he is, is only a presence. That’s why I say I don’t do
anything. I am just here for you to do something. You can come close to
me. That’s what happens when I am talking to you: unawares,</p><p>you start moving closer to me. Your physical bodies remain where they
are – and leave them there! – but you start moving towards me. Perhaps
you will understand what I am saying, because I can see – when somebody
starts moving towards me, I can see – the body is left behind and the
person has come very close to me. It is in that moment you feel afire,
ignited. But the whole credit always goes to you.</p><p><br></p><p>I am not the savior.</p><p><br></p><p>And I do not want ever to be known, by that ugly word, savior. I am
just a presence.</p><p>You can save yourself</p><p><br></p><p>You can burn your candles from my fire and my fire will not lose
anything. Yes, you will gain eternity.</p><p>You will gain ultimate bliss.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part19>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

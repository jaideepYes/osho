IT SEEMS THAT I AM DEATHLY AFRAID OF BEING ALONE. HOW CAN I GO TOTALLY INTO MY ALONENESS WITH JOY INSTEAD OF FEAR?\nTHE word “meaning” is irrelevant to life. Life is neither meaningful nor meaningless.\nBut for centuries man’s mind has been conditioned to believe that life has great meaning. All that meaning was arbitrary. Hence only in this century, for the first time in the whole history of man, has the question, “What is the meaning of life?” become one of the most important, because all old lies are exposed.\nLife was meaningful with a God. Life was meaningful with a life beyond death. Life was meaningful because the churches, synagogues, temples, mosques, were continuously hammering the idea in man’s mind.\nA certain maturity has come to man, not to all, but to a very small minority.\nI would like you to remember five significant names. First is Soren Kierkegaard. He was the first man who raised this question and was condemned universally, because even to raise the question created suspicion in people. Nobody had dared, ever, to ask, What is the meaning of life?\nEven the atheists who had denied God, who had denied the afterlife, who had denied the existence of the soul – even they had never asked what the meaning of life is. They said, Eat, drink and be merry – that is the meaning of life.” It was clear to them that these joys – “eat, drink, be merry” – were what life is all about.\nBut Soren Kierkegaard went very deeply into the question. He created, unknowingly, a movement: existentialism. Then followed the four other names: Martin Heidegger, Karl Jaspers, Gabriel Marcel, and the last but not the least important – in fact the most important – Jean-Paul Sartre. These five people went on hammering on the whole intelligentsia of the world: that life is meaningless.\nNow, anybody who has some kind of intelligence is bound to come across this question, and he has to find some way to encounter it.\nI do not agree with these five great philosophers, but I give them the respect that they deserve. They were courageous, because once you take meaning out of life, religion disappears, because religion up to now has been nothing but an effort to give meaning to your life: to fill it so that you don’t feel empty; to surround you with God and angels so that you don’t feel lonelyYou have not been going\nto the church, the synagogue, and the temple without any reason.\nFor thousands of years man has not been bowing down to the priests without any reason. He was gaining something. Of course they were exploiting him, but even in their exploitation man was finding a certain consolation. He was not alone, he was being looked after. Life was not futile, it had tremendous meaning, spiritual, esoteric, profound.so high and so deep that your intellect could\nnot comprehend it.\nStill the majority of people, ninety-nine percent, are not bothered by the question. How can they be bothered? They easily find consolation from the dead past. To them it is not a dead past.\nI have told you about Bishop Jenkins of England who declared that there was no resurrection, that it is a myth; that there was no virgin birth, it is an absolute lie, and that there is no need for anybody to believe in all these mythologies to become a Christian. Of course, there he is not right because he says, “I don’t need all these things – I can still believe in God.” I can’t see what reason he can give for his faith in God.\nChristians were not fools to go on believing in absurdities for two thousand years. The reason was, without those absurdities, you cannot support God the ultimate absurdity. Now, it is like taking your legs and your hands and your head and everything away and saying I still believe in you. Nothing is left behind.\nAll the theologians, from Thomas Aquinas to any modern preacher, understand perfectly well that God needs support.\nEvery lie needs support.\nOnly truth can stand on its own feet.\nThe lie cannot stand on its own feet. It needs borrowed legs, a borrowed head, a borrowed heart – everything borrowed. If you go on taking things away piece by piece, and then you say in the end that all these things are not needed, that you still have faith in God.So for a Christian, according\nto Jenkins, these things should not be required as a fundamental part of Christianity. I don’t know whom he is befooling. Certainly he is befooling himself, because these are the supports, and if you have taken all the supports, the house will fall down. And he has not given a single reason now for faith in God.\nBut I have remembered him again today because a few days ago lightning struck one of the most beautiful cathedrals in England, York, and almost the majority of the masses believe that it is not a coincidence: it is God punishing the church for installing a man like Jenkins as a bishop. He was the fourth in the hierarchy; he had just to pass two people to become the archbishop of England. And it would not have been difficult to pass these two people. Life is so full of accidents – they may die or something – one can always hope. And he was not so far away, just close.\nBut all over England now, it is believed that God has punished the church. But this is a strange God, and a strange punishment, because Jenkins was not the bishop of this cathedral. This is strange. Jenkins was two hundred miles away. Your God is such a great shot – He missed him by two hundred miles! A master archer.\nAnd what has the cathedral of York to do with Jenkins’ statement? Lightning should be on Jenkins or on the cathedral or church where he was the bishop, or on the archbishop of Canterbury because he had appointed him. But this cathedral in York is in no way connected.\nBut people have found a relationship – it is not a coincidence. Then life becomes related to profound realities, even your small stupidities. Now even if God si there, do you think He will bother about Bishop Jenkins? And if He does bother then what kind of anger is this? He should at least learn a little marksmanship. And He must have been doing this for millions of years; so much training.…\nI am reminded that a king who was a very great lover of archery – and he himself was a master archer – always wanted to meet anybody who was better than him. But his whole life he could never find anybody who was better than him. But one day when he was passing through a small village, he saw on every tree a strange thing – perfect marksmanship, a master far better than him. On every tree, on the wooden fences, everywhere, he found a round circle with an arrow just exactly in the middle.\nHe stopped his chariot and asked, “Where is this great archer? I would like to honor him. I will take him to the palace – he should be my master. I have been in search but I have never found anybody better than me. But this man seems to be a hundred percent accurate. Not even by a minute part of an inch does he miss; he exactly hits the center.”\nHe went to a few trees and measured and it was the exact center. He asked somebody from the villagebecause people had gathered; the king was there, the golden chariot was there – and what\nis he doing? And he asked them, “Where is this great archer?”\nThey all laughed, they said, “He is no archer, he is the idiot of this village.” They said, “You don’t understand.”\n“You are all idiots!” the king said. “Such a great archer and you call him an idiot?”\nThey said, “First, try to understand. He is no archer, he is just a fool. First he shoots the arrow and then he draws the circle. Of course it is perfectly accurate, the circle he draws afterwards. So wherever the arrow goes, there he makes the circle. Don’t get worried about him, just go on your way. He is a complete idiot.\n“We have been telling him that this is not the way of archery. First you make the circle and then you shoot, but he goes on doing it his own way: he shoots first. He says, ‘What does it matter which you do first and which you do second? This way it is always perfect. Your way does not work at all, I have tried it.’”\nNow, God, for millions of years, has been threatening people with lightning, killing people with lightning. Hinduism believes that lightning is nothing but the arrow of the lord Shiva. So whenever there is lightning they have to make a sacrifice to Shiva, to pray or do some rituals, because lightning is the perfect symbol that Shiva is angry, and they have to find the person who has made him angry.\nBut in the twentieth century, in this last part of the twentieth century, in one of the most educated and sophisticated countries like England, most of the people believe that it is a punishment sent by the lord to Bishop Jenkins! If this is God’s archery then I don’t think any man is a lesser archer than Him. You won’t miss by two hundred miles! Even that idiot who discovered the right way was far more intelligent than this God.\nBut why do people go on believing in such things? It is not without reason. The reason is that all these things are giving meaning to their lives. A God above makes you feel safe, secure. If there is no God then the whole sky is empty, and you are left alone. You are so tiny, and the emptiness is so vast. Fear is bound to strike you – just to think of the emptiness of the sky, which is infinite, because there cannot be any boundary anywhere. The old religions all believed there is a boundary, but that is absolutely illogical. A boundary means there must be something beyond it, otherwise how can you make a boundary? Yes, you can make a boundary around your house because of the neighbor’s house. You can create a fencing around your house because the earth continues beyond your fencing.\nBut if you are creating a fencing where the earth ends, and there is nothing else beyond your fencing, your fencing will fall into the emptiness. How will it be supported from the other side? To create a boundary, two things are needed; one on this side and one on the other side.\nObviously existence cannot have any boundary.\nIt is fearful to conceive infinity, the emptiness continuing forever and ever. You will never come to a point where you can say, “Now we have reached the end.”\nThere is no end and there is no beginning.\nNow, think of a story which has no beginning and no end. It was one of my pastimes.… I have never been much interested in novels, but once in a while when I had nothing else to read I had my own way of reading a novel – just from the middle, because that gave it some authenticity. With no beginning, you have to work out what must have preceded because you start suddenly in the middle. And I would never go to the end. Again I would stop halfway – halfway through the second half First I would try to figure out what the beginning could be and what the end could be; then I would start reading from the beginning.\nAnd I was puzzled that I always managed to figure out the beginning and the end. I never missed, not only in details but on all the basic points, because it is a man – created thing, and the mind works in a certain fashion. It has a routine way of working. If this is the middle, created by a human mind, and if I understand the human mind, I can figure out what the beginning will be and what the end will be.\nYes, if the book is written by a madman, then certainly I am not be able to figure it out. But madmen don’t write books. That is very compassionate of them. But in fact if they start writing books, their books will be far more interesting than the books written by scholars, intellectuals, because the intellect has a certain pattern of work.\nI am not in favor of all these five “existentialists” – in quotes – because I am not even ready to call them existentialists. Kierkegaard never really lived, or if you call his life, life, then it was worse than death. He came out of his house only once a month, and the house was not much, just a small room. His father, seeing that his son seemed to be a little crazy – continuously reading and writing – tried to read his books, and threw them away because he could not manage to figure out what Kierkegaard wanted to say. And he goes on and on about nothing, much ado about nothing.\nKierkegaard never got married. One foolish woman was in love with him... must have been foolish, because he was an ugly man in the first place, and a strange type, eccentric, who lived in the darkness of his room. Once a month he had to go out because his father, before he died, had put money in the post office and made an arrangement that every month Kierkegaard could draw a certain amount. He knew that Kierkegaard was not going to earn any money; he would simply die in his room, so his father sold everything and deposited it in the post office. That’s why Kierkegaard had to go out once every month; the first day of the month he would go out.\nHe lived in Copenhagen, and the whole town waited because it was a rare opportunity – Kierkegaard coming out of his room. The children used to follow him to the post office; it was almost a procession. And he had written a book, EITHER OR, which had just been published and that had become his nickname in Copenhagen. So the children would be shouting “either-or” – that was his real name to them – “Either-or is going to the post office!”\nIt was a great insight on the part of the children to name this man Either-or, because he was exactly that. That’s why he could not marry the woman, because he continued to think: either-or. All the favorable points for marriage, and all the unfavorable points for marriage all balanced out. He could not decide. The woman waited for three years, but he said, “Forgive me, I cannot decide. It is still either-or.”\nNow, this man, who had never loved, who had not a single friend, who had not in any way contacted\nnature, who never communed in any way with existenceIf he feels life is meaningless, no wonder\n– it has to be meaningless. But he is projecting his feeling of meaninglessness on everybody.\nAnd then came these four other so-called existentialists. I am calling them so-called because they had no communion with existence at all. The only way to have communion with existence is silence; and they didn’t know the language of silence – how could they commune with existence? So what were they doing? They were exposing the lie that the religious people have imposed on humanity. And it was a lie.\nThe meaning that religious people have given to human life is arbitrary. These people are exposing the arbitrariness of the religious people’s meaning – but that does not mean that life is meaningless. It simply means that the meaning that was given to life up to now is found invalid:\nGod is not the meaning of life.\nLife beyond death is not the meaning of life.\nJesus Christ is not the meaning of life. But that does not mean that life has no meaning.\nBut because you have been thinking that this is the meaning of life, when suddenly it falls apart, you pick up the polar opposite idea of meaninglessness.\nI want you to remember my standpoint.\nI am an existentialist. And I say to you that life is neither meaningful nor meaningless. The question is irrelevant.\nLife is just an opportunity, an opening. It depends what you make of it.\nIt depends on you what meaning, what color, what song, what poetry, what dance you give to it. Life is a creative challenge.\nAnd it is good that it hasn’t any fixed meaning, otherwise there would be no challenge. Then it would be just a ready-made thing: you are born and the meaning of life is given to you and you carry it your whole life; this is the meaning of your life. No, existence is far more profound than any meaning.\nExistence is just a challenge to creativity.\nIt allows you all the space that you need – and you think it is empty? Just try to use the right words, because words have a certain context. “Empty” is a sad word; it seems something is missing, something that should have been is not there. But why call it empty? Why in the first place expect that something should be there waiting for you? Who are you? Give it the right name.\nIt is one of the basic arts of living to call things by their right name, the right word, to make the right gesture... because even a slightly wrong word brings wrong associations. Now, “empty”...\nthe very sound of the word reminds you of something futile. No, I give it a different meaning: it is spaciousness, uncluttered with anything.\nExistence is so spacious that it allows you absolute freedom to be whatsoever you want to be, whatsoever you have the capacity to be.\nIt allows you an unhindered space to grow and to blossom. It does not impose anything on you.\nGod imposes things on you. He wants you to be a certain kind of man, having a certain kind of personality, morality, ethics, etiquette. He wants to put you into a cage. And you think to be caged is to have found meaning? To be caged is to be dead.\nNietzsche is far truer when he says, “God is dead and I proclaim to humanity that now man is free.” He is saying two things: “God is dead” – that is the least important part of his statement, which has angered all the religions of the world. The most important part is the second part: “Hence man is free.” Just think a little bit about it.\nGod is equivalent to slavery.\nNo God is equivalent to freedom.\nAnd freedom is bound to be spacious – don’t call it empty. Yes, it is empty of any hindrance. It is empty of any structure. It is empty of any guidance. It does not force you to move in a certain direction, to be someone.\nNo, life gives you all the space you need, perhaps more space than you need. Space out, rather than bothering about why life is empty. It is good – this spaciousness without boundaries, with no guidelines, with no map. You can move like a cloud in the sky: untethered, unforced. Wherever the wind takes you, wherever you reach, that is the goal.\nOrdinarily we have been taught that there should be a goal and then you start reaching towards it; if you reach then you have succeeded. But really you have missed immense opportunities. In going for this particular goal you have lost immensely the whole richness of life.\nWhy does one feel life is meaningless? – because in the first place you expect some meaning to be there. Who told you that you have to expect some meaning?\nThis is what I call the wrong that religions have done to man. They have told you there is meaning; you accepted it – and when you don’t find it, you are frustrated, you feel lost.\nSo many intelligent people go on committing suicide. The greatest numbers of suicides in any single profession is in the profession of philosophy. More philosophers commit suicide than any other profession. Strange! Professors should be wise people, philosophers particularly so. But what goes wrong? – their expectation of finding meaning. They try hard to find it, and it is not there. It was never there in the first place.\nOther people don’t try to find meaning, that’s why they need not commit suicide: they never feel frustrated. They know that they have not tried to find it so they feel they are sinners, that something\nis wrong with them; but they never feel that they have to commit suicide because life is meaningless. They have not searched; meaning was always there. They have not cared. They have not listened to the priest, to the wiseguys who are all around, who are giving advice freely – although nobody takes it.\nAdvice is the only thing in the world that everybody gives and nobody takes. And everybody knows it.\nThese people – Jaspers, Marcel, Heidegger, Sartre, they have moved to the opposite polarity. Religions say that life is meaningful because God cannot create a meaningless life; it has an intrinsic meaning, a significance. You have to fulfill it, and you will be rewarded for it. Religions gave this hope but these people found that there is no God, that nobody has created a meaningful life, that there is no destiny – man is just driftwood going nowhere. So they moved to the opposite polarity – life is meaningless.\nJust see the point: religions say life is meaningful, and these so-called existentialists have impressed on the intelligentsia of the world that life is meaningless. But to me they are both making the same mistake.\nI say that meaning is irrelevant to life. Let me explain to you. Now, what is the smell of the color red? You will say, “It is irrelevant – smell has nothing to do with color.” And if you start searching for a certain smell in the color red – because scriptures say, priests say, religions say, and thousands of years of traditions say that the color red has a certain fragrance – you will find that there is no fragrance. Color and smell are totally different dimensions; they never meet. Neither has smell any color, nor has color any smell. That does not mean that color is futile, throw it away.\nLife and meaning are totally different.\nMeaning is a logical concept, and life has nothing to do with logic.\nPeople who want to live have to put logic aside otherwise you cannot live, logic will come in everywhere preventing you from living...”either-or.” You will think much, but you will not live much.\nAnd the more you think, the less is the possibility of living. Living needs a little transcendence from thinking.\nZorba the Greek says to his boss, “Boss, only one thing is wrong with you – you think too much.” And he is right; even his boss realizes finally that he is right. The whole day Zorba works hard, labors – and then he dances and plays some instrument. What is it in Italian... santuri? – or in Greek... santuri? I think whatever it is, santuri is a good name! Anyway all names are made up. Let’s call it a santuri.\nHe plays the santuri, he dances, he goes mad, dancing – and the boss simply sits. One day Zorba says, “What are you doing sitting there? There is a full moon, there is the river, the sands are calling, and the winds are so cool – come along with me.” With very hesitant feet the boss goes with him because Zorba is dragging him, and Zorba is a very strong man.\nThe boss is just a boss as bosses are supposed to be: a rich man, intellectual, but not strong. That Zorba just pulls him and starts dancing and playing on his santuri. And the boss also tries a little bit, but finds it exhilarating – the wind, the moon, the river, the sand, and the mad way Zorba plays his santuri, and the mad way he dancesSlowly slowly, he forgets that he is boss and starts dancing.\nIt takes a little time to slip out of the mind, but he does. It is only for a few moments, but now he too knows that life has a different taste.\nLife is not available to thinking.\nPerhaps it is available to dancing, to singing.\nOne thing is certain, that thinking is the most dry dimension of your life. It is a desert with no oasis.\nIf you feel life is meaningless, that simply means you don’t know how to live. You don’t know that meaning has nothing to do with life.\nThis has to be a fundamental principle:\nLife has nothing to do with meaning. It is not arithmetic.\nIt is not logic.\nIt is not philosophy.\nLiving in itself is such an ecstasy – who cares for meaning? Can’t you visualize experiences which are intrinsically so joyous that even to ask the question about meaning will look idiotic? Nobody asks, What is the meaning of love? But these people who are asking, What is the meaning of life? are bound to ask, What is the meaning of love?\nThere is one Russian story, a small story. In a village a man, a young man, is called an idiot by everybody. From his very childhood he has heard that, that he is an idiot. And when so many people are saying it – his father, his mother, his uncles, the neighbors, and everybody – of course he starts believing that he must be an idiot. How can so many people be wrong? – and they are all important people. But when he becomes older and this continues, he becomes an absolutely sealed idiot; there is no way to get out of it. He tried hard but whatsoever he did was thought to be idiotic.\nThat is very human. Once a man goes mad he may become normal again but nobody is going to take him as normal. He may do something normal but you will suspect that there must be something insane about it. And your suspicion will make him hesitant and his hesitancy wi]l make you suspicion stronger; then there is a vicious circle. So that man tried in every possible way to look wise, to do wise things, but whatsoever he did people would always say it was idiotic.\nA saint was passing by. He went to the saint in the night when there was nobody about and asked him, “Just help me to get out of this locked state. I am sealed in. They don’t let me out; they have not left any window or door open so that I can jump out. And whatsoever I do, even if it is exactly the same as they do, still I am an idiot. What should I do?”\nThe saint said, “Do just one thing. Whenever somebody says,‘Look how beautiful the sunset is,’ you say,”you idiot, prove it! What is beautiful there? I don’t see any beauty. You prove it.’ If somebody says,‘Look at that beautiful rose flower,’ catch hold of him and tell him,‘Prove it! What grounds have you to call this ordinary flower beautiful? There have been millions of rose flowers. There are millions, there will be millions in the future; what special thing has this rose flower got? And what are your fundamental reasons which prove logically that this rose flower is beautiful?’\n“If somebody says,‘This book of Leo Tolstoy is very beautiful,’ just catch hold of him and ask him,‘Prove where it is beautiful; what is beautiful in it? It is just an ordinary story – just the same story which has been told millions of times, just the same triangle in every story: either two men and one woman or two women and one man, but the same triangle. All love stories are triangles. So what is new in it?“’\nThe man said, “That’s right.”\nThe saint said, “Don’t miss any chance, because nobody can prove these things; they are unprovable. And when they cannot prove it, they will look idiotic and they will stop calling you an idiot. Next time, when I return, just give me the information how things are going.\nAnd next time when the saint was coming back, even before he could meet the old idiot, people of the village informed him, “A miracle has happened. We had an idiot in our town; he has become the wisest man. We would like you to meet him.”\nAnd the saint knew who that “wisest man” was. He said, “I would certainly love to see him. In fact I was hoping to meet him.”\nThe saint was taken to the idiot and the idiot said, “You are a miracle-worker, a miracle man. The trick worked! I simply started calling everyone an idiot, stupid. Somebody would be talking of love, somebody would be talking of beauty, somebody would be talking of art, painting, sculpture, and my standpoint was the same:‘Prove it!’ And because they could not prove it, they looked idiotic.\nAnd it is a strange thing. I was never hoping to gain this much out of it. All that I wanted was to get out of that confirmed idiocy. It is strange that now I am no longer an idiot, I have become the most wise man, and I know I am the same – and you know it too.”\nBut the saint said, “Never tell this secret to anybody else. Keep the secret to yourself Do you think I am a saint? Yes, the secret is between us. This is how I became a saint. This is how you have become a wiseman.” This is how things go on in the world.\nOnce you ask, What is the meaning of life? you have asked the wrong question. And obviously somebody will say, “this is the meaning of life” – and it cannot be proved. Then one thing is proved automatically: that life is meaningless. But that is a fallacy. That’s why I say that all these five existentialists – great names because theirs is the only great philosophical school that has arisen in these last few decades – have defeated all other philosophical schools with the same trick, the same one that the idiot used. About any painting they will say, “Meaningless!” Of any poetry they will say, “Meaningless!” And there is no way to prove beauty; either you see it or you don’t see it. There is no way to prove love; if you have to prove it, you are finished. Can you prove your love?\nIt is good that people take it for granted, at least in the beginning, that they love each other without asking, “Do you really love me? Where is love? Prove it first.” Then love would disappear from the world because nobody can prove it. How can you prove it? At the most you can say, “You can listen to my heartbeat.”\nAnd the other person can listen to your heartbeat and say, “I can hear your heartbeat, but I don’t hear any love. I don’t hear any song or dance or any bells ringing. It is just a heartbeat.” You can find a stethoscope and listen to it more accurately, more loudly, so then it becomes really loud, but you will not find any love there. Love is not a heartbeat.\nThen what is love?\nHas anybody ever been able to define it? No, there is no way to define it.\nThere are things which are indefinable, hence I call my religion pure mysticism, because I accept things which cannot be explained, which cannot be defined, which can only be lived, which can only be known by experience. If you try to think about them you are going to miss them.\nAll these five great philosophers have missed life absolutely because they asked the wrong question, they accepted the wrong answer, they fought the wrong answer and they moved to the polar opposite. And remember, if you move from one wrong thing and to oppose it, you go to the polar opposite, you reach another wrong thing – because only wrong can be the polar opposite of another wrong, not right.\nLife is simply an experience. Your birth is only the beginning. You are not born ready-made.\nYou are born with all dimensions open. That’s the beauty and dignity of man.\nA dog is born as a dog; he will remain a dog. He comes with a certain structure, lifestyle, morality, religion, philosophy. He brings with him everything ready-made; in fact nature provides him with everything. He never feels meaningless. He never bothers about meaning – it is only man who bothers. Hence he thinks he needs a very great philosophical understanding. The dog comes into the world completed.\nMan is born incomplete, open; it is left to him what he is going to become, what he is going to make out of his life.\nThis creates problems, but all those problems are challenges to be accepted, faced.\nYou have to be in constant effort for your own growth. Yes, many times you will move in a wrong direction, but don’t be worried, that’s how we learn-by making mistakes.\nMy father used to stop me, saying, “Don’t do that, you are doing it wrong.”\nI said, “One thing should be settled between us: let me find out that it is wrong, and never stop me when I am going to commit a mistake.”\nHe said, “What! You are going to commit a mistake and I am not to stop you?”\nI said, “Yes, because without mistakes I will never learn. And how long are you going to be with me?\nAre you going to live for me, on my behalf? I have to live myself So please be kind enough: let me fall, let me make mistakes, let me go wrong, allow me to see what is right and what is wrong. Yes, I am groping, but only through this groping will I find out. And that which is found by you is only yours.”\nJesus may have found truth, Buddha may have found truth, but it is all hogwash, just meaningless to you. You will have to travel the path, many paths, out of which some will take you in the wrong direction and you will have to return to find the right one. But if you go on searching you are bound to find, because when you start finding that the path is wrong, you are already starting to feel what is right. It may not be very clear to you, but the moment you see that something is wrong, side by side somewhere inside you, you have already achieved a glimpse of the right.\nTo know something as a lie means that you have got a vague idea of what is truth. So just moving in wrong directions is not wrong, because it is through that movement that you will slowly, slowly, crystallize the idea of the right. And once you find what is right then you will jump out of your bathtub and run naked in the streets shouting, “Eureka! Eureka! Eureka!”\nThat’s what happened to Archimedes. He ran into the palace of the king, naked, into the court! – shouting just one word, “Eureka! I have found it!”\nBut the king said, “Don’t be so excited – at least you should have put some clothes on. Along the whole street people have gathered and you are standing in the court.”\nThen he looked and saw that he was naked. He said, “in fact, I was in my bathtub, and that’s where I found it.” A great present had been given to the king which was made of gold. The king had given him the job of finding some way of telling whether it was pure gold or was there some mixture?\nThe king said, “I don’t want you to destroy it and I don’t want you to cut it. I don’t want you to poke into it to find out whether it is also pure gold inside. Work out a method where you don’t touch it, and find out whether it is pure gold.” And that’s what he had found while he was in the tub.\nThe tub was full of water, absolutely full. When he entered the tub he saw water spilling out. As he lay down in the tub, he saw more water spilling out. And a sudden flash in the mind – he jumped out of the tub and saw how much water had spilled out, and how much the water level had gone down. And he saw it was exactly his volume. He had found the way!\nNow, find some pure gold and put it in water. The bath should be full, then water will spill out because you have put the gold into the water. Now weigh the water that has overflowed, and then you know how much water spills out when you add a certain weight of pure gold. Then bring the king’s present, and put it into the water. You are not destroying it, not touching it. If exactly the same amount of water spills out as did from the same weight of pure gold, then the present is pure gold. Otherwise it is impure; some other metal is there.\nAfter the discovery he was so ecstatic that he forgot all about the bathroom, and the clothes, and he just ran And the king could understand. He said, “I can understand when someone finds something on his own, it is so ecstatic.” Just a small thing – he had not found God or nirvana or enlightenment. No, he had just found a way to decide whether the gold was pure or not. But even that, the flash of finding something, makes you aware of your own intelligence. The greater the finding, the greater you feel your intelligence.\nWhen you find what life is by living, then you will not find yourself surrounded by emptiness, you will be surrounded by space, pure space, which allows you to grow in every direction.\nExistence is freedom.\nAnd yes, I agree with Nietzsche: man is free.\nUp to now the religions have tried to make man a slave – spiritually, psychologically, but a slave all the same.\nNietzsche is not right that God is dead, because God has never been there. It was just his emphasis – I know that he was a man of tremendous insight and could not commit such a mistake. When he says, “God is dead,” he does not mean that God was there and is now dead. He wants to emphasize the fact that there is no God: forget about God and forget about all the mythologies that you have lived by up to now. From now onwards you are free. Live in freedom, and create yourself\nWhy be created by God? And anyway God is not capable of creating you. just look: He created Eve out of a rib from Adam – a great creator! In the first place is He a certified surgeon? I don’t think that He is an F.R.C.S., and He is doing surgery without anesthesia. Adam was just asleep and He took out his rib. But when you are stupid then you are going to believe in any stupid thing. And from the rib how can you create the woman?\nI don’t see any way to create a woman from a rib. This is pure crap! – and so insulting to women that at least women should stop going to all the churches and all the synagogues – because God has dealt such an insult He cannot be forgiven! Let him apologize. What do these liberation women go on doing? They should protest before every church, before every synagogue, that no woman will enter unless that statement from the Bible is removed.\nWoman is created from the rib of Adam? Why could He not also create woman the way He has created Adam? The word Adam means earth, mud. First He made Adam with earth, and then breathed life into him. Now, when He was making woman, was earth missing? Was all the mud finished with one Adam? It would have been easier to make the woman also from earth. Why take a rib from this poor man?\nAnd after that, you know what used to happen? I have just heard about it, I don’t know whether it is true or not. Every night when Adam came home and went to sleep, the first thing Eve would do was count his ribs, because she was afraid God might create another woman. Every night.It was\na natural fear because if another rib was missing then Adam would have been in real trouble. But God never did the same operation again.\nHumanity’s past is full of myth, and a myth simply means an invented story to give you a bogus feeling of meaning.\nAnd man, even very educated people, cultured peopleI had one professor, my colleague in the\nuniversity, who was a great follower of these people: Soren Kierkegaard to Jean-Paul Sartre. He himself thought that he was an existentialist. I asked him, “Do you really think there is no God?”\nHe said, “Yes, there is no God, no Holy Ghost, no Jesus Christ.” He had been a Christian. I said, “If I can manage some meeting with one of these three fellows”\nHe said, “What! A meeting! How can you manage a meeting? Nobody has ever seen them. It is all just superstition.”\nI said, “Okay, come to my house tonight.”\nHe started becoming a little afraid: “But what will you do?” I said, “That you don’t ask. First let the meeting happen.” He said, “With whom?”\nI said, “Don’t be bothered – with whomsoever I can get the appointment. I don’t know yet with whom I can get the appointment. You come with me tonight. Eat with me, sleep in my house and I will try my best.”\nHe said, “But I am very busy today.”\nI said, “There is no problem, then tomorrow. It is going to happen one day so this busyness without business won’t help – you are not busy.”\nHe said, “That’s right, I am not busy. I was just trying to get out of this.”\nI said, “Why? I am going to make an appointment, and you are trying to get out of it. You deny them, and having denied them then you say life is meaningless. I will make your life meaningful tonight.”\nHe said, “My God! Okay.”\nBut sitting with me in my car, he would look at me again and again, and he would say, “With whom are you going to make?”\nI said, “Don’t worry, that is my business. And I have done it many times so don’t worry!”\nBut how could the poor man stop worrying? A minute or two minutes would pass, then again he would say, “You can just tell me. Are you joking, kidding?”\nI said, “I am a serious man and this is no joke – making an appointment with one of the fellows in the trinity.”\nEating, he was not there, he was just afraid. And I told him, “Now I am going to make the appointment. This is the room for you to sleep in. You rest or you can read. I will be here nearabout ten tonight.”\nHe said, “Where are you going?”\nI said, “I have a place where I can arrange to have a contact.” He said, “A place! Are you mad or something?”\nI said, “You just wait. It is only a question of one night and it will be decided.”\nI had a friend in the medical college. I went to him; he was a professor, and I told him that I wanted one skeleton just for the night. He said, “What are you up to?”\nI said, “Don’t be worried, nobody will be killed and no problem will arise out of it.”\nHe said, “It is not permissible for me. They are under my... I have the key. If one skeleton is missing tomorrow I will be caught.”\nI said, “Before morning it will be back here. It is just that I have to make one appointment with a man.”\nHe said, “What appointment?”\nI said, “Don’t be worried. Just let me finish, don’t waste my time. Just give me a skeleton.” He said, “If you insist, take one, but before morning it should be back.”\nI said, “Don’t be worried; perhaps there will be two skeletons. I don’t know what will happen, because this is just an appointment. A meeting will happen and then after the meeting nobody knows. It is with the Holy Ghost.”\nThe medical professor said, “I am coming with you. It seems there is some risk.”\nI said, “You can come. There is just enjoyment, entertainment – no risk. Come with me” – and he did.\nI was living in a big bungalow so I had given the professor of philosophy a side room which had a bathroom attached and a small walk-in closet. We reached home. I left the skeleton in the garage. I knocked on the door; he came, looking afraid. He opened the door and said, “What about the appointment?”\nI said, “Everything is fixed, the appointment is going to happen. You just rest in your bed and whenever you hear three knocks you should go into your bathroom.”\nHe said, “In the bathroom?”\nI said, “What can I do? I tried my best to tell him that there is a good sitting room, but the Holy Ghost is the Holy Ghost.”\nHe said, “I will meet him in the bathroom if you insist.”\nI said, “I have no objection, and I don’t think you have any objection.” He said, “Holy Ghost! – in the bathroom?”\nOnly in the bathroom was it possible, because from the back there was a door into the bathroom so I could bring the Holy Ghost in from the back. Otherwise from where to bring it into his room? In India, just to clean the bathroom, you have to have a door from the outside because the people who clean the bathrooms cannot go through the inside of your house. That is impossible in India. So I had kept that door open from the very beginning.\nHe went to bed and covered himself with the blanket. I put the light off. He said, “No. Keep the light on.”\nI said, “Don’t be worried, because when the Holy Ghost comes, the light comes on, he is so illuminated. Don’t be worried.”\nHe said, “But still, keep the light on. And where will you be?”\nI said, “I will be in the next room. If there is any trouble, or if the Holy Ghost does any unholy thing to you, either you can hide in this closet and lock it from the inside so he cannot do anything to you, or if you still have any voice left, you can call me – I will come immediately. But my experience, because this appointment has happened many times before, is that people lose their voice. They want to say something, they want to scream, but they cannot; they are just choked – just the presence of the Holy Ghost!”\nHe said, “I was an idiot to talk to you about this meaninglessness of life. Perhaps there is meaning.” I said, “No need to change your philosophy so soon. First let the meeting happen.”\nAnd the meeting happened. I persuaded him to put the light off because otherwise the Holy Ghost wouldn’t come. So I put the light off. I brought the skeleton in through the back door and put it in the right place in the bathroom. Just nearabout twelve – the other professor was also staying with me in my room – we knocked on his door. I had told him, “The moment the Holy Ghost knocks on your door, open the bathroom door and have the meeting. Whatsoever question you have to ask, you can ask. Everything else is then up to you. With the appointment my work is finished.”\nWe knocked on his door. He jumped out of his bed and fell on the floor! In the darkness he could not figure out where he was. He really wanted to get out of the room, but instead he went into the bath\nroom where I had kept the light on. The skeleton was there. He saw it and just fell down and went unconscious. I called the medical professor and said, “Now you help – this is the second skeleton! I’ll remove the first one to my car, and you take care of this man. That’s why I have brought you with me. You thought it was for some other reason, but a medical doctor is always needed when such encounters happen. Now look after him!”\nHe said, “You are a real trouble. Now I have to look after him, and perhaps he may die or anything may happen and I will be responsible because I am medically attending him.”\nBut he did not die. He opened his eyes, looked at the professor, looked at me, closed his eyes again and said, “Has... has he gone?” The first thing he asked was, “Has he gone?”\nI said, “Who?”\nHe said, “The Holy Ghost... and I do believe in God the father, the Holy Ghost and Jesus Christ and I will never say anything about it again.”\nI said, “This is good! I have converted you into a Christian.”\nHe said, “My God! What an experience. My wife will not believe it, nobody wi]l believe it. Even I would not have believed it if I had not seen it. Has he gone?”\nI said, “You can look in the bathroom.”\nHe opened the bathroom, looked and said, “Yes, he is gone.” And that man started going to church and became a very very religious person. The whole university was amazed at what had happened. I told them, “It is the result of a great encounter.”\n“What encounter?” they asked; and I spread the whole story.\nAnd I told him, “Don’t be a fool! Come with me to the medical doctor; he can tell you that I brought the skeleton. There was no Holy Ghost, no appointment. You are simply a coward.”\nHe said, “You cannot befool me now – I have seen with my own eyes. Am I to believe my eyes or your words – or any medical professor? I don’t care what anybody says, from now onwards I am going to remain a Christian. You cannot destroy my Christianity.”\nHe is still a Christian, very pious, helping others to be Christians – and all that he had seen was only a skeleton! I told him – I brought the medical professor and he told him – “You can come and we will show you the same skeleton so you can recognize it.”\nHe said, “I am not going. You showing anything to me.…” He said, “I don’t trust this man: if he can manage an encounter, a meeting with the Holy Ghost, he can manage anything. Perhaps the Holy Ghost is going to be there again, wherever you are both trying to take me. I am not going again, not before death.” And he crossed himself; each time he would say “Holy Ghost” he would make the sign of the cross. Such a conversion!\nBut people have been living under all kinds of superstitions which may have been founded on some reason in the past; but that reason they have not been able to understand clearly. It is true that Jesus did not die on the cross, but it is untrue that there was a resurrection. He was taken down from the cross and he escaped from Judea. While escaping from Judea, of course he met a few people, and certainly a few of his disciples. And they all thought that he was back, he was resurrected!\nBut he escaped from Judea because he knew perfectly well.That was the suggestion given to\nhim by Pontius Pilate – because he allowed him to escape. The whole credit goes to that Roman governor-general of Judea. It is a strange coincidence that Rome became the citadel of Christianity: it was Rome who crucified Jesus, it was a Roman governor-general who had helped him to escape. But it was made clear to Jesus that he should not be found inside Judea or nearby because then Pontius Pilate would be held responsible; so he had to escape as far away as possible.\nAnd Jesus escaped really far away: he died in Kashmir in India. I have been to his grave. He lived a long life of one hundred and twelve years. But those six hours on the cross were enough: he never tried again to prove that he was the messiah. And in India nobody would have bothered about him; messiah means nothing there. There are hundreds of living incarnations of God any time, any day, any night.\nOnce I happened to stay in Allahabad. I was attending a Hindu world conference. Somebody by mistake had invited me thinking that I was a Hindu. They found out, but it was too late. By that time I had disturbed everything that they were planning: how to convert the whole world into Hinduism.\nI was staying with hundreds of other guests in tents by the side of the Ganges, a beautiful place they had chosen for the conference. In those tents at least five incarnations of God were present. In India it is so easy. Nobody can object – you can declare yourself an incarnation of God. About that India is very nice. Who cares? Who bothers? It is your business: if you think you are an incarnation of God, good; be an incarnation of God. You are not doing any harm to anybody.\nBut that one experience of Jesus’ was so bad, so horrible, that he dropped the idea of messiah- hood, and he dropped the idea of solving the problems of the whole of humanity. He had found what happens if you try to redeem humanity – you are crucified!\nBut his escaping helped a religion to be born. Now, Christians have no report of what happened after his resurrection. If he was resurrected, okay. Then what happened? When did he die? Where did he die? Where is his grave? Why have you not preserved his grave? because that must be the holiest thing for you. All that they have preserved – Sheela has just informed me – was the foreskin of Jesus Christ.because he must have been circumcised.\nThe poor Christians... and even that has been stolen from the Vatican yesterday! Now they have nothing! It was not much anyway. What can you do with the foreskin? And I don’t think it was his foreskin; anybody’s would do because foreskins are just foreskins. It is not written on it, “Jesus Christ” – but somebody has done a really great job, stealing it\nNow the whole of Christianity is shaken because their greatest treasure is lost.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"9390","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/from_personality_to_individuality/part2/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/from_personality_to_individuality/>From Personality to Individuality</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">2 To define is to confine \-- existence has no boundaries</h1><div class=post-meta>45 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;9390 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/From_Personality_to_Individuality/part2.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part1>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

IT SEEMS THAT I
AM DEATHLY AFRAID OF BEING ALONE. HOW CAN I GO TOTALLY INTO MY ALONENESS
WITH JOY INSTEAD OF FEAR?</p><p><br></p><p>THE word “meaning” is irrelevant to life. Life is neither meaningful
nor meaningless.</p><p>But for centuries man’s mind has been conditioned to believe that
life has great meaning. All that meaning was arbitrary. Hence only in
this century, for the first time in the whole history of man, has the
question, “What is the meaning of life?” become one of the most
important, because all old lies are exposed.</p><p><br></p><p>Life was meaningful with a God. Life was meaningful with a life
beyond death. Life was meaningful because the churches, synagogues,
temples, mosques, were continuously hammering the idea in man’s
mind.</p><p><br></p><p>A certain maturity has come to man, not to all, but to a very small
minority.</p><p>I would like you to remember five significant names. First is Soren
Kierkegaard. He was the first man who raised this question and was
condemned universally, because even to raise the question created
suspicion in people. Nobody had dared, ever, to ask, What is the meaning
of life?</p><p><br></p><p>Even the atheists who had denied God, who had denied the afterlife,
who had denied the existence of the soul – even they had never asked
what the meaning of life is. They said, Eat, drink and be merry – that
is the meaning of life.” It was clear to them that these joys – “eat,
drink, be merry” – were what life is all about.</p><p><br></p><p>But Soren Kierkegaard went very deeply into the question. He created,
unknowingly, a movement: existentialism. Then followed the four other
names: Martin Heidegger, Karl Jaspers, Gabriel Marcel, and the last but
not the least important – in fact the most important – Jean-Paul Sartre.
These five people went on hammering on the whole intelligentsia of the
world: that life is meaningless.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, anybody who has some kind of intelligence is bound to come
across this question, and he has to find some way to encounter it.</p><p><br></p><p>I do not agree with these five great philosophers, but I give them
the respect that they deserve. They were courageous, because once you
take meaning out of life, religion disappears, because religion up to
now has been nothing but an effort to give meaning to your life: to fill
it so that you don’t feel empty; to surround you with God and angels so
that you don’t feel lonely<span class=s4></span>You have not been
going</p><p>to the church, the synagogue, and the temple without any reason.</p><p><br></p><p>For thousands of years man has not been bowing down to the priests
without any reason. He was gaining something. Of course they were
exploiting him, but even in their exploitation man was finding a certain
consolation. He was not alone, he was being looked after. Life was not
futile, it had tremendous meaning, spiritual, esoteric, profound.<span class=s4></span>so high and so deep that your intellect could</p><p>not comprehend it.</p><p><br></p><p>Still the majority of people, ninety-nine percent, are not bothered
by the question. How can they be bothered? They easily find consolation
from the dead past. To them it is not a dead past.</p><p><br></p><p>I have told you about Bishop Jenkins of England who declared that
there was no resurrection, that it is a myth; that there was no virgin
birth, it is an absolute lie, and that there is no need for anybody to
believe in all these mythologies to become a Christian. Of course, there
he is not right because he says, “I don’t need all these things – I can
still believe in God.” I can’t see what reason he can give for his faith
in God.</p><p><br></p><p>Christians were not fools to go on believing in absurdities for two
thousand years. The reason was, without those absurdities, you cannot
support God the ultimate absurdity. Now, it is like taking your legs and
your hands and your head and everything away and saying I still believe
in you. Nothing is left behind.</p><p><br></p><p>All the theologians, from Thomas Aquinas to any modern preacher,
understand perfectly well that God needs support.</p><p><br></p><p>Every lie needs support.</p><p>Only truth can stand on its own feet.</p><p><br></p><p>The lie cannot stand on its own feet. It needs borrowed legs, a
borrowed head, a borrowed heart – everything borrowed. If you go on
taking things away piece by piece, and then you say in the end that all
these things are not needed, that you still have faith in God.<span class=s4></span>So for a Christian, according</p><p>to Jenkins, these things should not be required as a fundamental part
of Christianity. I don’t know whom he is befooling. Certainly he is
befooling himself, because these are the supports, and if you have taken
all the supports, the house will fall down. And he has not given a
single reason now for faith in God.</p><p><br></p><p>But I have remembered him again today because a few days ago
lightning struck one of the most beautiful cathedrals in England, York,
and almost the majority of the masses believe that it is not a
coincidence: it is God punishing the church for installing a man like
Jenkins as a bishop. He was the fourth in the hierarchy; he had just to
pass two people to become the archbishop of England. And it would not
have been difficult to pass these two people. Life is so full of
accidents – they may die or something – one can always hope. And he was
not so far away, just close.</p><p><br></p><p>But all over England now, it is believed that God has punished the
church. But this is a strange God, and a strange punishment, because
Jenkins was not the bishop of this cathedral. This is strange. Jenkins
was two hundred miles away. Your God is such a great shot – He missed
him by two hundred miles! A master archer.</p><p><br></p><p>And what has the cathedral of York to do with Jenkins’ statement?
Lightning should be on Jenkins or on the cathedral or church where he
was the bishop, or on the archbishop of Canterbury because he had
appointed him. But this cathedral in York is in no way connected.</p><p><br></p><p>But people have found a relationship – it is not a coincidence. Then
life becomes related to profound realities, even your small stupidities.
Now even if God si there, do you think He will bother about Bishop
Jenkins? And if He does bother then what kind of anger is this? He
should at least learn a little marksmanship. And He must have been doing
this for millions of years; so much training.…</p><p><br></p><p>I am reminded that a king who was a very great lover of archery – and
he himself was a master archer – always wanted to meet anybody who was
better than him. But his whole life he could never find anybody who was
better than him. But one day when he was passing through a small
village, he saw on every tree a strange thing – perfect marksmanship, a
master far better than him. On every tree, on the wooden fences,
everywhere, he found a round circle with an arrow just exactly in the
middle.</p><p><br></p><p>He stopped his chariot and asked, “Where is this great archer? I
would like to honor him. I will take him to the palace – he should be my
master. I have been in search but I have never found anybody better than
me. But this man seems to be a hundred percent accurate. Not even by a
minute part of an inch does he miss; he exactly hits the center.”</p><p><br></p><p>He went to a few trees and measured and it was the exact center. He
asked somebody from the village<span class=s4></span>because people
had gathered; the king was there, the golden chariot was there – and
what</p><p>is he doing? And he asked them, “Where is this great archer?”</p><p>They all laughed, they said, “He is no archer, he is the idiot of
this village.” They said, “You don’t understand.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You are all idiots!” the king said. “Such a great archer and you
call him an idiot?”</p><p><br></p><p>They said, “First, try to understand. He is no archer, he is just a
fool. First he shoots the arrow and then he draws the circle. Of course
it is perfectly accurate, the circle he draws afterwards. So wherever
the arrow goes, there he makes the circle. Don’t get worried about him,
just go on your way. He is a complete idiot.</p><p><br></p><p>“We have been telling him that this is not the way of archery. First
you make the circle and then you shoot, but he goes on doing it his own
way: he shoots first. He says, ‘What does it matter which you do first
and which you do second? This way it is always perfect. Your way does
not work at all, I have tried it.’”</p><p><br></p><p>Now, God, for millions of years, has been threatening people with
lightning, killing people with lightning. Hinduism believes that
lightning is nothing but the arrow of the lord Shiva. So whenever there
is lightning they have to make a sacrifice to Shiva, to pray or do some
rituals, because lightning is the perfect symbol that Shiva is angry,
and they have to find the person who has made him angry.</p><p><br></p><p>But in the twentieth century, in this last part of the twentieth
century, in one of the most educated and sophisticated countries like
England, most of the people believe that it is a punishment sent by the
lord to Bishop Jenkins! If this is God’s archery then I don’t think any
man is a lesser archer than Him. You won’t miss by two hundred miles!
Even that idiot who discovered the right way was far more intelligent
than this God.</p><p><br></p><p>But why do people go on believing in such things? It is not without
reason. The reason is that all these things are giving meaning to their
lives. A God above makes you feel safe, secure. If there is no God then
the whole sky is empty, and you are left alone. You are so tiny, and the
emptiness is so vast. Fear is bound to strike you – just to think of the
emptiness of the sky, which is infinite, because there cannot be any
boundary anywhere. The old religions all believed there is a boundary,
but that is absolutely illogical. A boundary means there must be
something beyond it, otherwise how can you make a boundary? Yes, you can
make a boundary around your house because of the neighbor’s house. You
can create a fencing around your house because the earth continues
beyond your fencing.</p><p><br></p><p>But if you are creating a fencing where the earth ends, and there is
nothing else beyond your fencing, your fencing will fall into the
emptiness. How will it be supported from the other side? To create a
boundary, two things are needed; one on this side and one on the other
side.</p><p><br></p><p>Obviously existence cannot have any boundary.</p><p><br></p><p>It is fearful to conceive infinity, the emptiness continuing forever
and ever. You will never come to a point where you can say, “Now we have
reached the end.”</p><p><br></p><p>There is no end and there is no beginning.</p><p>Now, think of a story which has no beginning and no end. It was one
of my pastimes.… I have never been much interested in novels, but once
in a while when I had nothing else to read I had my own way of reading a
novel – just from the middle, because that gave it some authenticity.
With no beginning, you have to work out what must have preceded because
you start suddenly in the middle. And I would never go to the end. Again
I would stop halfway – halfway through the second half First I would try
to figure out what the beginning could be and what the end could be;
then I would start reading from the beginning.</p><p><br></p><p>And I was puzzled that I always managed to figure out the beginning
and the end. I never missed, not only in details but on all the basic
points, because it is a man – created thing, and the mind works in a
certain fashion. It has a routine way of working. If this is the middle,
created by a human mind, and if I understand the human mind, I can
figure out what the beginning will be and what the end will be.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, if the book is written by a madman, then certainly I am not be
able to figure it out. But madmen don’t write books. That is very
compassionate of them. But in fact if they start writing books, their
books will be far more interesting than the books written by scholars,
intellectuals, because the intellect has a certain pattern of work.</p><p><br></p><p>I am not in favor of all these five “existentialists” – in quotes –
because I am not even ready to call them existentialists. Kierkegaard
never really lived, or if you call his life, life, then it was worse
than death. He came out of his house only once a month, and the house
was not much, just a small room. His father, seeing that his son seemed
to be a little crazy – continuously reading and writing – tried to read
his books, and threw them away because he could not manage to figure out
what Kierkegaard wanted to say. And he goes on and on about nothing,
much ado about nothing.</p><p><br></p><p>Kierkegaard never got married. One foolish woman was in love with
him... must have been foolish, because he was an ugly man in the first
place, and a strange type, eccentric, who lived in the darkness of his
room. Once a month he had to go out because his father, before he died,
had put money in the post office and made an arrangement that every
month Kierkegaard could draw a certain amount. He knew that Kierkegaard
was not going to earn any money; he would simply die in his room, so his
father sold everything and deposited it in the post office. That’s why
Kierkegaard had to go out once every month; the first day of the month
he would go out.</p><p><br></p><p>He lived in Copenhagen, and the whole town waited because it was a
rare opportunity – Kierkegaard coming out of his room. The children used
to follow him to the post office; it was almost a procession. And he had
written a book, EITHER OR, which had just been published and that had
become his nickname in Copenhagen. So the children would be shouting
“either-or” – that was his real name to them – “Either-or is going to
the post office!”</p><p><br></p><p>It was a great insight on the part of the children to name this man
Either-or, because he was exactly that. That’s why he could not marry
the woman, because he continued to think: either-or. All the favorable
points for marriage, and all the unfavorable points for marriage all
balanced out. He could not decide. The woman waited for three years, but
he said, “Forgive me, I cannot decide. It is still either-or.”</p><p><br></p><p>Now, this man, who had never loved, who had not a single friend, who
had not in any way contacted</p><p>nature, who never communed in any way with existence<span class=s4></span>If he feels life is meaningless, no wonder</p><p>– it has to be meaningless. But he is projecting his feeling of
meaninglessness on everybody.</p><p><br></p><p>And then came these four other so-called existentialists. I am
calling them so-called because they had no communion with existence at
all. The only way to have communion with existence is silence; and they
didn’t know the language of silence – how could they commune with
existence? So what were they doing? They were exposing the lie that the
religious people have imposed on humanity. And it was a lie.</p><p><br></p><p>The meaning that religious people have given to human life is
arbitrary. These people are exposing the arbitrariness of the religious
people’s meaning – but that does not mean that life is meaningless. It
simply means that the meaning that was given to life up to now is found
invalid:</p><p><br></p><p>God is not the meaning of life.</p><p><br></p><p>Life beyond death is not the meaning of life.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus Christ is not the meaning of life. But that does not mean that
life has no meaning.</p><p><br></p><p>But because you have been thinking that this is the meaning of life,
when suddenly it falls apart, you pick up the polar opposite idea of
meaninglessness.</p><p><br></p><p>I want you to remember my standpoint.</p><p><br></p><p>I am an existentialist. And I say to you that life is neither
meaningful nor meaningless. The question is irrelevant.</p><p><br></p><p>Life is just an opportunity, an opening. It depends what you make of
it.</p><p>It depends on you what meaning, what color, what song, what poetry,
what dance you give to it. Life is a creative challenge.</p><p>And it is good that it hasn’t any fixed meaning, otherwise there
would be no challenge. Then it would be just a ready-made thing: you are
born and the meaning of life is given to you and you carry it your whole
life; this is the meaning of your life. No, existence is far more
profound than any meaning.</p><p><br></p><p>Existence is just a challenge to creativity.</p><p><br></p><p>It allows you all the space that you need – and you think it is
empty? Just try to use the right words, because words have a certain
context. “Empty” is a sad word; it seems something is missing, something
that should have been is not there. But why call it empty? Why in the
first place expect that something should be there waiting for you? Who
are you? Give it the right name.</p><p><br></p><p>It is one of the basic arts of living to call things by their right
name, the right word, to make the right gesture... because even a
slightly wrong word brings wrong associations. Now, “empty”...</p><p>the very sound of the word reminds you of something futile. No, I
give it a different meaning: it is spaciousness, uncluttered with
anything.</p><p><br></p><p>Existence is so spacious that it allows you absolute freedom to be
whatsoever you want to be, whatsoever you have the capacity to be.</p><p><br></p><p>It allows you an unhindered space to grow and to blossom. It does not
impose anything on you.</p><p><br></p><p>God imposes things on you. He wants you to be a certain kind of man,
having a certain kind of personality, morality, ethics, etiquette. He
wants to put you into a cage. And you think to be caged is to have found
meaning? To be caged is to be dead.</p><p><br></p><p>Nietzsche is far truer when he says, “God is dead and I proclaim to
humanity that now man is free.” He is saying two things: “God is dead” –
that is the least important part of his statement, which has angered all
the religions of the world. The most important part is the second part:
“Hence man is free.” Just think a little bit about it.</p><p><br></p><p>God is equivalent to slavery.</p><p><br></p><p>No God is equivalent to freedom.</p><p><br></p><p>And freedom is bound to be spacious – don’t call it empty. Yes, it is
empty of any hindrance. It is empty of any structure. It is empty of any
guidance. It does not force you to move in a certain direction, to be
someone.</p><p><br></p><p>No, life gives you all the space you need, perhaps more space than
you need. Space out, rather than bothering about why life is empty. It
is good – this spaciousness without boundaries, with no guidelines, with
no map. You can move like a cloud in the sky: untethered, unforced.
Wherever the wind takes you, wherever you reach, that is the goal.</p><p><br></p><p>Ordinarily we have been taught that there should be a goal and then
you start reaching towards it; if you reach then you have succeeded. But
really you have missed immense opportunities. In going for this
particular goal you have lost immensely the whole richness of life.</p><p><br></p><p>Why does one feel life is meaningless? – because in the first place
you expect some meaning to be there. Who told you that you have to
expect some meaning?</p><p><br></p><p>This is what I call the wrong that religions have done to man. They
have told you there is meaning; you accepted it – and when you don’t
find it, you are frustrated, you feel lost.</p><p><br></p><p>So many intelligent people go on committing suicide. The greatest
numbers of suicides in any single profession is in the profession of
philosophy. More philosophers commit suicide than any other profession.
Strange! Professors should be wise people, philosophers particularly so.
But what goes wrong? – their expectation of finding meaning. They try
hard to find it, and it is not there. It was never there in the first
place.</p><p><br></p><p>Other people don’t try to find meaning, that’s why they need not
commit suicide: they never feel frustrated. They know that they have not
tried to find it so they feel they are sinners, that something</p><p>is wrong with them; but they never feel that they have to commit
suicide because life is meaningless. They have not searched; meaning was
always there. They have not cared. They have not listened to the priest,
to the wiseguys who are all around, who are giving advice freely –
although nobody takes it.</p><p><br></p><p>Advice is the only thing in the world that everybody gives and nobody
takes. And everybody knows it.</p><p><br></p><p>These people – Jaspers, Marcel, Heidegger, Sartre, they have moved to
the opposite polarity. Religions say that life is meaningful because God
cannot create a meaningless life; it has an intrinsic meaning, a
significance. You have to fulfill it, and you will be rewarded for it.
Religions gave this hope but these people found that there is no God,
that nobody has created a meaningful life, that there is no destiny –
man is just driftwood going nowhere. So they moved to the opposite
polarity – life is meaningless.</p><p><br></p><p>Just see the point: religions say life is meaningful, and these
so-called existentialists have impressed on the intelligentsia of the
world that life is meaningless. But to me they are both making the same
mistake.</p><p><br></p><p>I say that meaning is irrelevant to life. Let me explain to you. Now,
what is the smell of the color red? You will say, “It is irrelevant –
smell has nothing to do with color.” And if you start searching for a
certain smell in the color red – because scriptures say, priests say,
religions say, and thousands of years of traditions say that the color
red has a certain fragrance – you will find that there is no fragrance.
Color and smell are totally different dimensions; they never meet.
Neither has smell any color, nor has color any smell. That does not mean
that color is futile, throw it away.</p><p><br></p><p>Life and meaning are totally different.</p><p><br></p><p>Meaning is a logical concept, and life has nothing to do with
logic.</p><p><br></p><p>People who want to live have to put logic aside otherwise you cannot
live, logic will come in everywhere preventing you from
living...”either-or.” You will think much, but you will not live
much.</p><p><br></p><p>And the more you think, the less is the possibility of living. Living
needs a little transcendence from thinking.</p><p>Zorba the Greek says to his boss, “Boss, only one thing is wrong with
you – you think too much.” And he is right; even his boss realizes
finally that he is right. The whole day Zorba works hard, labors – and
then he dances and plays some instrument. What is it in Italian...
santuri? – or in Greek... santuri? I think whatever it is, santuri is a
good name! Anyway all names are made up. Let’s call it a santuri.</p><p><br></p><p>He plays the santuri, he dances, he goes mad, dancing – and the boss
simply sits. One day Zorba says, “What are you doing sitting there?
There is a full moon, there is the river, the sands are calling, and the
winds are so cool – come along with me.” With very hesitant feet the
boss goes with him because Zorba is dragging him, and Zorba is a very
strong man.</p><p>The boss is just a boss as bosses are supposed to be: a rich man,
intellectual, but not strong. That Zorba just pulls him and starts
dancing and playing on his santuri. And the boss also tries a little
bit, but finds it exhilarating – the wind, the moon, the river, the
sand, and the mad way Zorba plays his santuri, and the mad way he
dances<span class=s4></span>Slowly slowly, he forgets that he is boss
and starts dancing.</p><p>It takes a little time to slip out of the mind, but he does. It is
only for a few moments, but now he too knows that life has a different
taste.</p><p><br></p><p>Life is not available to thinking.</p><p><br></p><p>Perhaps it is available to dancing, to singing.</p><p><br></p><p>One thing is certain, that thinking is the most dry dimension of your
life. It is a desert with no oasis.</p><p><br></p><p>If you feel life is meaningless, that simply means you don’t know how
to live. You don’t know that meaning has nothing to do with life.</p><p><br></p><p>This has to be a fundamental principle:</p><p><br></p><p>Life has nothing to do with meaning. It is not arithmetic.</p><p>It is not logic.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not philosophy.</p><p><br></p><p>Living in itself is such an ecstasy – who cares for meaning? Can’t
you visualize experiences which are intrinsically so joyous that even to
ask the question about meaning will look idiotic? Nobody asks, What is
the meaning of love? But these people who are asking, What is the
meaning of life? are bound to ask, What is the meaning of love?</p><p><br></p><p>There is one Russian story, a small story. In a village a man, a
young man, is called an idiot by everybody. From his very childhood he
has heard that, that he is an idiot. And when so many people are saying
it – his father, his mother, his uncles, the neighbors, and everybody –
of course he starts believing that he must be an idiot. How can so many
people be wrong? – and they are all important people. But when he
becomes older and this continues, he becomes an absolutely sealed idiot;
there is no way to get out of it. He tried hard but whatsoever he did
was thought to be idiotic.</p><p><br></p><p>That is very human. Once a man goes mad he may become normal again
but nobody is going to take him as normal. He may do something normal
but you will suspect that there must be something insane about it. And
your suspicion will make him hesitant and his hesitancy wi]l make you
suspicion stronger; then there is a vicious circle. So that man tried in
every possible way to look wise, to do wise things, but whatsoever he
did people would always say it was idiotic.</p><p><br></p><p>A saint was passing by. He went to the saint in the night when there
was nobody about and asked him, “Just help me to get out of this locked
state. I am sealed in. They don’t let me out; they have not left any
window or door open so that I can jump out. And whatsoever I do, even if
it is exactly the same as they do, still I am an idiot. What should I
do?”</p><p>The saint said, “Do just one thing. Whenever somebody says,‘Look how
beautiful the sunset is,’ you say,”you idiot, prove it! What is
beautiful there? I don’t see any beauty. You prove it.’ If somebody
says,‘Look at that beautiful rose flower,’ catch hold of him and tell
him,‘Prove it! What grounds have you to call this ordinary flower
beautiful? There have been millions of rose flowers. There are millions,
there will be millions in the future; what special thing has this rose
flower got? And what are your fundamental reasons which prove logically
that this rose flower is beautiful?’</p><p><br></p><p>“If somebody says,‘This book of Leo Tolstoy is very beautiful,’ just
catch hold of him and ask him,‘Prove where it is beautiful; what is
beautiful in it? It is just an ordinary story – just the same story
which has been told millions of times, just the same triangle in every
story: either two men and one woman or two women and one man, but the
same triangle. All love stories are triangles. So what is new in
it?“’</p><p><br></p><p>The man said, “That’s right.”</p><p><br></p><p>The saint said, “Don’t miss any chance, because nobody can prove
these things; they are unprovable. And when they cannot prove it, they
will look idiotic and they will stop calling you an idiot. Next time,
when I return, just give me the information how things are going.</p><p><br></p><p>And next time when the saint was coming back, even before he could
meet the old idiot, people of the village informed him, “A miracle has
happened. We had an idiot in our town; he has become the wisest man. We
would like you to meet him.”</p><p><br></p><p>And the saint knew who that “wisest man” was. He said, “I would
certainly love to see him. In fact I was hoping to meet him.”</p><p><br></p><p>The saint was taken to the idiot and the idiot said, “You are a
miracle-worker, a miracle man. The trick worked! I simply started
calling everyone an idiot, stupid. Somebody would be talking of love,
somebody would be talking of beauty, somebody would be talking of art,
painting, sculpture, and my standpoint was the same:‘Prove it!’ And
because they could not prove it, they looked idiotic.</p><p><br></p><p>And it is a strange thing. I was never hoping to gain this much out
of it. All that I wanted was to get out of that confirmed idiocy. It is
strange that now I am no longer an idiot, I have become the most wise
man, and I know I am the same – and you know it too.”</p><p><br></p><p>But the saint said, “Never tell this secret to anybody else. Keep the
secret to yourself Do you think I am a saint? Yes, the secret is between
us. This is how I became a saint. This is how you have become a
wiseman.” This is how things go on in the world.</p><p><br></p><p>Once you ask, What is the meaning of life? you have asked the wrong
question. And obviously somebody will say, “this is the meaning of life”
– and it cannot be proved. Then one thing is proved automatically: that
life is meaningless. But that is a fallacy. That’s why I say that all
these five existentialists – great names because theirs is the only
great philosophical school that has arisen in these last few decades –
have defeated all other philosophical schools with the same trick, the
same one that the idiot used. About any painting they will say,
“Meaningless!” Of any poetry they will say, “Meaningless!” And there is
no way to prove beauty; either you see it or you don’t see it. There is
no way to prove love; if you have to prove it, you are finished. Can you
prove your love?</p><p>It is good that people take it for granted, at least in the
beginning, that they love each other without asking, “Do you really love
me? Where is love? Prove it first.” Then love would disappear from the
world because nobody can prove it. How can you prove it? At the most you
can say, “You can listen to my heartbeat.”</p><p><br></p><p>And the other person can listen to your heartbeat and say, “I can
hear your heartbeat, but I don’t hear any love. I don’t hear any song or
dance or any bells ringing. It is just a heartbeat.” You can find a
stethoscope and listen to it more accurately, more loudly, so then it
becomes really loud, but you will not find any love there. Love is not a
heartbeat.</p><p><br></p><p>Then what is love?</p><p><br></p><p>Has anybody ever been able to define it? No, there is no way to
define it.</p><p>There are things which are indefinable, hence I call my religion pure
mysticism, because I accept things which cannot be explained, which
cannot be defined, which can only be lived, which can only be known by
experience. If you try to think about them you are going to miss
them.</p><p><br></p><p>All these five great philosophers have missed life absolutely because
they asked the wrong question, they accepted the wrong answer, they
fought the wrong answer and they moved to the polar opposite. And
remember, if you move from one wrong thing and to oppose it, you go to
the polar opposite, you reach another wrong thing – because only wrong
can be the polar opposite of another wrong, not right.</p><p><br></p><p>Life is simply an experience. Your birth is only the beginning. You
are not born ready-made.</p><p>You are born with all dimensions open. That’s the beauty and dignity
of man.</p><p>A dog is born as a dog; he will remain a dog. He comes with a certain
structure, lifestyle, morality, religion, philosophy. He brings with him
everything ready-made; in fact nature provides him with everything. He
never feels meaningless. He never bothers about meaning – it is only man
who bothers. Hence he thinks he needs a very great philosophical
understanding. The dog comes into the world completed.</p><p><br></p><p>Man is born incomplete, open; it is left to him what he is going to
become, what he is going to make out of his life.</p><p><br></p><p>This creates problems, but all those problems are challenges to be
accepted, faced.</p><p>You have to be in constant effort for your own growth. Yes, many
times you will move in a wrong direction, but don’t be worried, that’s
how we learn-by making mistakes.</p><p><br></p><p>My father used to stop me, saying, “Don’t do that, you are doing it
wrong.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “One thing should be settled between us: let me find out that
it is wrong, and never stop me when I am going to commit a mistake.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “What! You are going to commit a mistake and I am not to
stop you?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Yes, because without mistakes I will never learn. And how
long are you going to be with me?</p><p><br></p><p>Are you going to live for me, on my behalf? I have to live myself So
please be kind enough: let me fall, let me make mistakes, let me go
wrong, allow me to see what is right and what is wrong. Yes, I am
groping, but only through this groping will I find out. And that which
is found by you is only yours.”</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus may have found truth, Buddha may have found truth, but it is
all hogwash, just meaningless to you. You will have to travel the path,
many paths, out of which some will take you in the wrong direction and
you will have to return to find the right one. But if you go on
searching you are bound to find, because when you start finding that the
path is wrong, you are already starting to feel what is right. It may
not be very clear to you, but the moment you see that something is
wrong, side by side somewhere inside you, you have already achieved a
glimpse of the right.</p><p><br></p><p>To know something as a lie means that you have got a vague idea of
what is truth. So just moving in wrong directions is not wrong, because
it is through that movement that you will slowly, slowly, crystallize
the idea of the right. And once you find what is right then you will
jump out of your bathtub and run naked in the streets shouting, “Eureka!
Eureka! Eureka!”</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what happened to Archimedes. He ran into the palace of the
king, naked, into the court! – shouting just one word, “Eureka! I have
found it!”</p><p><br></p><p>But the king said, “Don’t be so excited – at least you should have
put some clothes on. Along the whole street people have gathered and you
are standing in the court.”</p><p><br></p><p>Then he looked and saw that he was naked. He said, “in fact, I was in
my bathtub, and that’s where I found it.” A great present had been given
to the king which was made of gold. The king had given him the job of
finding some way of telling whether it was pure gold or was there some
mixture?</p><p><br></p><p>The king said, “I don’t want you to destroy it and I don’t want you
to cut it. I don’t want you to poke into it to find out whether it is
also pure gold inside. Work out a method where you don’t touch it, and
find out whether it is pure gold.” And that’s what he had found while he
was in the tub.</p><p><br></p><p>The tub was full of water, absolutely full. When he entered the tub
he saw water spilling out. As he lay down in the tub, he saw more water
spilling out. And a sudden flash in the mind – he jumped out of the tub
and saw how much water had spilled out, and how much the water level had
gone down. And he saw it was exactly his volume. He had found the
way!</p><p>Now, find some pure gold and put it in water. The bath should be
full, then water will spill out because you have put the gold into the
water. Now weigh the water that has overflowed, and then you know how
much water spills out when you add a certain weight of pure gold. Then
bring the king’s present, and put it into the water. You are not
destroying it, not touching it. If exactly the same amount of water
spills out as did from the same weight of pure gold, then the present is
pure gold. Otherwise it is impure; some other metal is there.</p><p><br></p><p>After the discovery he was so ecstatic that he forgot all about the
bathroom, and the clothes, and he just ran And the king could
understand. He said, “I can understand when someone finds something on
his own, it is so ecstatic.” Just a small thing – he had not found God
or nirvana or enlightenment. No, he had just found a way to decide
whether the gold was pure or not. But even that, the flash of finding
something, makes you aware of your own intelligence. The greater the
finding, the greater you feel your intelligence.</p><p><br></p><p>When you find what life is by living, then you will not find yourself
surrounded by emptiness, you will be surrounded by space, pure space,
which allows you to grow in every direction.</p><p><br></p><p>Existence is freedom.</p><p><br></p><p>And yes, I agree with Nietzsche: man is free.</p><p><br></p><p>Up to now the religions have tried to make man a slave – spiritually,
psychologically, but a slave all the same.</p><p><br></p><p>Nietzsche is not right that God is dead, because God has never been
there. It was just his emphasis – I know that he was a man of tremendous
insight and could not commit such a mistake. When he says, “God is
dead,” he does not mean that God was there and is now dead. He wants to
emphasize the fact that there is no God: forget about God and forget
about all the mythologies that you have lived by up to now. From now
onwards you are free. Live in freedom, and create yourself</p><p><br></p><p>Why be created by God? And anyway God is not capable of creating you.
just look: He created Eve out of a rib from Adam – a great creator! In
the first place is He a certified surgeon? I don’t think that He is an
F.R.C.S., and He is doing surgery without anesthesia. Adam was just
asleep and He took out his rib. But when you are stupid then you are
going to believe in any stupid thing. And from the rib how can you
create the woman?</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t see any way to create a woman from a rib. This is pure crap!
– and so insulting to women that at least women should stop going to all
the churches and all the synagogues – because God has dealt such an
insult He cannot be forgiven! Let him apologize. What do these
liberation women go on doing? They should protest before every church,
before every synagogue, that no woman will enter unless that statement
from the Bible is removed.</p><p><br></p><p>Woman is created from the rib of Adam? Why could He not also create
woman the way He has created Adam? The word Adam means earth, mud. First
He made Adam with earth, and then breathed life into him. Now, when He
was making woman, was earth missing? Was all the mud finished with one
Adam? It would have been easier to make the woman also from earth. Why
take a rib from this poor man?</p><p>And after that, you know what used to happen? I have just heard about
it, I don’t know whether it is true or not. Every night when Adam came
home and went to sleep, the first thing Eve would do was count his ribs,
because she was afraid God might create another woman. Every night.<span class=s4></span>It was</p><p>a natural fear because if another rib was missing then Adam would
have been in real trouble. But God never did the same operation
again.</p><p><br></p><p>Humanity’s past is full of myth, and a myth simply means an invented
story to give you a bogus feeling of meaning.</p><p><br></p><p>And man, even very educated people, cultured people<span class=s4></span>I had one professor, my colleague in the</p><p>university, who was a great follower of these people: Soren
Kierkegaard to Jean-Paul Sartre. He himself thought that he was an
existentialist. I asked him, “Do you really think there is no God?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Yes, there is no God, no Holy Ghost, no Jesus Christ.” He
had been a Christian. I said, “If I can manage some meeting with one of
these three fellows<span class=s4></span>”</p><p>He said, “What! A meeting! How can you manage a meeting? Nobody has
ever seen them. It is all just superstition.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Okay, come to my house tonight.”</p><p><br></p><p>He started becoming a little afraid: “But what will you do?” I said,
“That you don’t ask. First let the meeting happen.” He said, “With
whom?”</p><p>I said, “Don’t be bothered – with whomsoever I can get the
appointment. I don’t know yet with whom I can get the appointment. You
come with me tonight. Eat with me, sleep in my house and I will try my
best.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “But I am very busy today.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “There is no problem, then tomorrow. It is going to happen
one day so this busyness without business won’t help – you are not
busy.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “That’s right, I am not busy. I was just trying to get out
of this.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Why? I am going to make an appointment, and you are trying
to get out of it. You deny them, and having denied them then you say
life is meaningless. I will make your life meaningful tonight.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “My God! Okay.”</p><p><br></p><p>But sitting with me in my car, he would look at me again and again,
and he would say, “With whom are you going to make<span class=s4></span>?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Don’t worry, that is my business. And I have done it many
times so don’t worry!”</p><p>But how could the poor man stop worrying? A minute or two minutes
would pass, then again he would say, “You can just tell me. Are you
joking, kidding?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I am a serious man and this is no joke – making an
appointment with one of the fellows in the trinity.”</p><p><br></p><p>Eating, he was not there, he was just afraid. And I told him, “Now I
am going to make the appointment. This is the room for you to sleep in.
You rest or you can read. I will be here nearabout ten tonight.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Where are you going?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I have a place where I can arrange to have a contact.” He
said, “A place! Are you mad or something?”</p><p>I said, “You just wait. It is only a question of one night and it
will be decided.”</p><p><br></p><p>I had a friend in the medical college. I went to him; he was a
professor, and I told him that I wanted one skeleton just for the night.
He said, “What are you up to?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Don’t be worried, nobody will be killed and no problem will
arise out of it.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “It is not permissible for me. They are under my... I have
the key. If one skeleton is missing tomorrow I will be caught.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Before morning it will be back here. It is just that I have
to make one appointment with a man.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “What appointment?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Don’t be worried. Just let me finish, don’t waste my time.
Just give me a skeleton.” He said, “If you insist, take one, but before
morning it should be back.”</p><p>I said, “Don’t be worried; perhaps there will be two skeletons. I
don’t know what will happen, because this is just an appointment. A
meeting will happen and then after the meeting nobody knows. It is with
the Holy Ghost.”</p><p><br></p><p>The medical professor said, “I am coming with you. It seems there is
some risk.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “You can come. There is just enjoyment, entertainment – no
risk. Come with me” – and he did.</p><p><br></p><p>I was living in a big bungalow so I had given the professor of
philosophy a side room which had a bathroom attached and a small walk-in
closet. We reached home. I left the skeleton in the garage. I knocked on
the door; he came, looking afraid. He opened the door and said, “What
about the appointment?”</p><p>I said, “Everything is fixed, the appointment is going to happen. You
just rest in your bed and whenever you hear three knocks you should go
into your bathroom.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “In the bathroom?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “What can I do? I tried my best to tell him that there is a
good sitting room, but the Holy Ghost is the Holy Ghost.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I will meet him in the bathroom if you insist.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I have no objection, and I don’t think you have any
objection.” He said, “Holy Ghost! – in the bathroom?”</p><p>Only in the bathroom was it possible, because from the back there was
a door into the bathroom so I could bring the Holy Ghost in from the
back. Otherwise from where to bring it into his room? In India, just to
clean the bathroom, you have to have a door from the outside because the
people who clean the bathrooms cannot go through the inside of your
house. That is impossible in India. So I had kept that door open from
the very beginning.</p><p><br></p><p>He went to bed and covered himself with the blanket. I put the light
off. He said, “No. Keep the light on.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Don’t be worried, because when the Holy Ghost comes, the
light comes on, he is so illuminated. Don’t be worried.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “But still, keep the light on. And where will you be?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I will be in the next room. If there is any trouble, or if
the Holy Ghost does any unholy thing to you, either you can hide in this
closet and lock it from the inside so he cannot do anything to you, or
if you still have any voice left, you can call me – I will come
immediately. But my experience, because this appointment has happened
many times before, is that people lose their voice. They want to say
something, they want to scream, but they cannot; they are just choked –
just the presence of the Holy Ghost!”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I was an idiot to talk to you about this meaninglessness of
life. Perhaps there is meaning.” I said, “No need to change your
philosophy so soon. First let the meeting happen.”</p><p>And the meeting happened. I persuaded him to put the light off
because otherwise the Holy Ghost wouldn’t come. So I put the light off.
I brought the skeleton in through the back door and put it in the right
place in the bathroom. Just nearabout twelve – the other professor was
also staying with me in my room – we knocked on his door. I had told
him, “The moment the Holy Ghost knocks on your door, open the bathroom
door and have the meeting. Whatsoever question you have to ask, you can
ask. Everything else is then up to you. With the appointment my work is
finished.”</p><p><br></p><p>We knocked on his door. He jumped out of his bed and fell on the
floor! In the darkness he could not figure out where he was. He really
wanted to get out of the room, but instead he went into the bath</p><p>room where I had kept the light on. The skeleton was there. He saw it
and just fell down and went unconscious. I called the medical professor
and said, “Now you help – this is the second skeleton! I’ll remove the
first one to my car, and you take care of this man. That’s why I have
brought you with me. You thought it was for some other reason, but a
medical doctor is always needed when such encounters happen. Now look
after him!”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “You are a real trouble. Now I have to look after him, and
perhaps he may die or anything may happen and I will be responsible
because I am medically attending him.”</p><p><br></p><p>But he did not die. He opened his eyes, looked at the professor,
looked at me, closed his eyes again and said, “Has... has he gone?” The
first thing he asked was, “Has he gone?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Who?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “The Holy Ghost... and I do believe in God the father, the
Holy Ghost and Jesus Christ and I will never say anything about it
again.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “This is good! I have converted you into a Christian.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “My God! What an experience. My wife will not believe it,
nobody wi]l believe it. Even I would not have believed it if I had not
seen it. Has he gone?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “You can look in the bathroom.”</p><p><br></p><p>He opened the bathroom, looked and said, “Yes, he is gone.” And that
man started going to church and became a very very religious person. The
whole university was amazed at what had happened. I told them, “It is
the result of a great encounter.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What encounter?” they asked; and I spread the whole story.</p><p><br></p><p>And I told him, “Don’t be a fool! Come with me to the medical doctor;
he can tell you that I brought the skeleton. There was no Holy Ghost, no
appointment. You are simply a coward.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “You cannot befool me now – I have seen with my own eyes. Am
I to believe my eyes or your words – or any medical professor? I don’t
care what anybody says, from now onwards I am going to remain a
Christian. You cannot destroy my Christianity.”</p><p><br></p><p>He is still a Christian, very pious, helping others to be Christians
– and all that he had seen was only a skeleton! I told him – I brought
the medical professor and he told him – “You can come and we will show
you the same skeleton so you can recognize it.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I am not going. You showing anything to me.…” He said, “I
don’t trust this man: if he can manage an encounter, a meeting with the
Holy Ghost, he can manage anything. Perhaps the Holy Ghost is going to
be there again, wherever you are both trying to take me. I am not going
again, not before death.” And he crossed himself; each time he would say
“Holy Ghost” he would make the sign of the cross. Such a conversion!</p><p>But people have been living under all kinds of superstitions which
may have been founded on some reason in the past; but that reason they
have not been able to understand clearly. It is true that Jesus did not
die on the cross, but it is untrue that there was a resurrection. He was
taken down from the cross and he escaped from Judea. While escaping from
Judea, of course he met a few people, and certainly a few of his
disciples. And they all thought that he was back, he was
resurrected!</p><p><br></p><p>But he escaped from Judea because he knew perfectly well.<span class=s4></span>That was the suggestion given to</p><p>him by Pontius Pilate – because he allowed him to escape. The whole
credit goes to that Roman governor-general of Judea. It is a strange
coincidence that Rome became the citadel of Christianity: it was Rome
who crucified Jesus, it was a Roman governor-general who had helped him
to escape. But it was made clear to Jesus that he should not be found
inside Judea or nearby because then Pontius Pilate would be held
responsible; so he had to escape as far away as possible.</p><p><br></p><p>And Jesus escaped really far away: he died in Kashmir in India. I
have been to his grave. He lived a long life of one hundred and twelve
years. But those six hours on the cross were enough: he never tried
again to prove that he was the messiah. And in India nobody would have
bothered about him; messiah means nothing there. There are hundreds of
living incarnations of God any time, any day, any night.</p><p><br></p><p>Once I happened to stay in Allahabad. I was attending a Hindu world
conference. Somebody by mistake had invited me thinking that I was a
Hindu. They found out, but it was too late. By that time I had disturbed
everything that they were planning: how to convert the whole world into
Hinduism.</p><p><br></p><p>I was staying with hundreds of other guests in tents by the side of
the Ganges, a beautiful place they had chosen for the conference. In
those tents at least five incarnations of God were present. In India it
is so easy. Nobody can object – you can declare yourself an incarnation
of God. About that India is very nice. Who cares? Who bothers? It is
your business: if you think you are an incarnation of God, good; be an
incarnation of God. You are not doing any harm to anybody.</p><p><br></p><p>But that one experience of Jesus’ was so bad, so horrible, that he
dropped the idea of messiah- hood, and he dropped the idea of solving
the problems of the whole of humanity. He had found what happens if you
try to redeem humanity – you are crucified!</p><p><br></p><p>But his escaping helped a religion to be born. Now, Christians have
no report of what happened after his resurrection. If he was
resurrected, okay. Then what happened? When did he die? Where did he
die? Where is his grave? Why have you not preserved his grave? because
that must be the holiest thing for you. All that they have preserved –
Sheela has just informed me – was the foreskin of Jesus Christ.<span class=s4></span>because he must have been circumcised.</p><p><br></p><p>The poor Christians... and even that has been stolen from the Vatican
yesterday! Now they have nothing! It was not much anyway. What can you
do with the foreskin? And I don’t think it was his foreskin; anybody’s
would do because foreskins are just foreskins. It is not written on it,
“Jesus Christ” – but somebody has done a really great job, stealing
it</p><p><br></p><p>Now the whole of Christianity is shaken because their greatest
treasure is lost.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part1>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

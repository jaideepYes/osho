ARE YOU THE LAST RAJNEESHEE? PLEASE EXPLAIN.\nIT was not me who said that Christ was the last Christian. I was simply quoting Friedrich Nietzsche; it was Nietzsche who made that statement. In a certain sense Nietzsche is absolutely right, because in this world no individual is ever repeated.\nThe uniqueness of the individual is absolute.\nNot only in contemporary times is nobody like you; in the whole of eternity there is never going to be a person like you again. There has never been a person like you before. You are simply you, incomparable.\nHence I support Nietzsche’s statement in this sense, that the last Christian was crucified two thousand years ago. But I would like to add something more to it.\nFirst: Jesus was not only the last Christian, he was also the first Christian – the first and the last Christian.\nBut this is only one sense of the statement. In other ways I am not in agreement with it, because as far as the word Christian is concerned – Jesus never even heard the word.\nHe was born a Jew, he lived as a Jew; he tried his whole life to prove himself to be a real Jew. In fact he was crucified because he was trying to prove himself to be a Jewish messiah. He had never heard the words christ or christian because he knew no Greek, no Latin; he knew only Aramaic and a little bit of Hebrew. And both languages have the word messiah, but christ is a Greek translation of the word messiah.\nThe word christ came into existence after Jesus, after three hundred years had passed; and out of the word christ comes christian. Slowly people completely forgot that poor Christ had no idea that he would be called Christ and his followers, Christians.\nYou will be surprised to know that in India the Hindi word for messiah is masiha, and the word for christian is masihi. Masihi is far closer to the Aramaic and Hebrew than what the Christians all over the world go on calling themselves.\nPerhaps the Hindi words masiha and masihi came into existence because Jesus, after escaping from the crucifixion – it was not a resurrection, it was an escape – lived in India for really a long time, to the age of one hundred and twelve years. His most beloved disciple, Thomas, followed him.\nIndian Christianity is the oldest in the whole world. The Vatican is a late development. Jesus remained in Kashmir completely tired, perhaps finished with humanity and the hope for some better future for it, because if this was the result – that you crucify a person who works for you and for your redemption, your salvation.Of course he was not an idiot: he learned the lesson.\nFor the remaining time Jesus stayed silent. Yes, a few people came to him on their own. But it was not a problem because in India there have been so many incarnations of God, and it is an accepted fact that it is nobody else’s business: if somebody feels he is an incarnation of God, let him be.\nWhat is wrong in it? Somewhere else the same person will be crucified, will be imprisoned; he will be psychoanalyzed, deprogrammed. All kinds of stupid things will be done to the person because he thinks he is an incarnation of God, but in India he will be worshipped.\nNobody will object to it. There is no question of objecting, because one thing is certain: that you cannot judge whether he is or he is not; there are no criteria, no methods to measure. And India has seen so many people like Jesus that it has come to realize that each one of them was so unique that you cannot derive any criteria from one which can be applied to another.\nBuddha was just himself. No similarity between Buddha and Krishna can be found; everything in them is just the opposite to each other. But India has lived thousands of years of religious philosophizing, teaching, arguing. It has attained to a certain liberality of mind as far as religion is concerned.\nIndia knows that a Krishna can be an incarnation of God, although he lives in a palace with every luxury; Buddha can be an incarnation of God although he renounces his kingdom, luxuries, comforts; Mahavira can be an incarnation of God, although he discards even his clothes and lives naked.\nIndia has seen so many ways of people like Jesus that it has come to one conclusion: leave the person alone. If you can learn something from him, good; otherwise there is no harm in paying him\nrespect. Perhaps he is right; and if he is wrong, what are you losing? Giving respect, even to a wrong person, is not bad.\nSo in Kashmir Jesus was not troubled by anybody. He was not news there. In India such people are not news. Thomas, he sent to the south of India for a special reason. Northern India is very sophisticated, and all these great teachers, Buddha, Mahavira, Krishna, Patanjali, Gorakh, Kabir – it is an unending line – were all born and lived in northern India, for the simple reason that northern India is Aryan.\nSouth India is non-Aryan, it has negroid blood. Once south India was just part of South Africa; South Africa has drifted away. Now it is a late discovery in geography that continents go on drifting, they are still drifting. The drift is very small, one foot in a year, so you cannot feel it. But continents are continuously drifting, they are not fixed: in thousands of years, of course, much change happens.\nIt was a great insight of Jesus to send Thomas to South India where it was possible to preach and spread Jesus’ word. In northern India nobody would have bothered about it. Northern India was so full of philosophical reasoning, argumentation; was so sophisticated that Thomas, a poor, uneducated man – who was going to listen to him?\nBut perhaps South India would be receptive; and it was. The whole state of Kerala is eighty percent Christian; and it is not a new phenomenon – it was Thomas’ work. Goa is completely Christian – Thomas’ body is still in Goa.\nIt reminds me to tell you of one thing: Thomas’ is the only body, outside Tibet, which is still the same as it was on the day the person died. It has not been preserved by any chemicals, or by any scientific methods. It is one of the rarest phenomena on the earth. Every year the body is brought out of the inner chambers of the church for the public to see.\nAnd I have seen the body, and you can see: it is as if the man has just gone to sleep, and not even died. Yes, he is not breathing, but in two thousand years the body has not deteriorated. Scientists have tried to find out how it is preserved. There is nothing to find because it is not preserved by any preservatives; it is through a long training in yoga and certain breathing exercises that have the capacity to change the inner workings of biochemistry.\nFor thirty years Thomas practiced yoga. Thomas lived like a Hindu brahmin. If you see a picture of Thomas you will be surprised. What kind of Christian is this? – his head shaved like a Hindu brahmin monk, with a small piece of hair on the top of his head left uncut, the choti. He even wore a thread, yagyopavit, that is only worn by born brahmins. He used only a small piece of cloth just to cover the lower part of his body, the loincloth as it is called.\nIf you have seen Mahatma Gandhi’s picture you know the cloth that just covers him from his waist to his knees – that’s enough. And in the south they use it just as a wraparound; Thomas used just the wraparound lungi, only up to the knee. And he used the wooden sandals. He looked a perfect Hindu.\nHe became vegetarian when he was in India. He tried to learn as much yoga as possible and he really performed a miracle. He said, “After my death don’t bury my body and don’t make a grave for\nme. I have managed to change its inner workings.” It was predicted by Thomas – and that prediction may come true – that his body would remain preserved till the very end of the world. Two thousand years have passed and the body is preserved. Only last year, for the first time, was a little sign of deterioration detected. Perhaps the end of the world is close.\nIf the man was right about his body, saying not to destroy it, it is going to remain till the very end of the world – and according to many sources the end of the world is coming closer – his prediction may also be true.\nOnly last year, that was 1984, for the first time a little deterioration appeared. Perhaps by the end of this century the body may have deteriorated completely. Thomas’ prediction is: the day my body deteriorates completely, that is the end of this world.\nThomas and Jesus both brought to India the word messiah which became masiha. It happens, when a word changes from one language to another language, it has to be adapted to the whims of the other language. “Messiah” will not fit in Hindi; “masiha” fits. “Messiah” would have remained something foreign, but “masiha” is transformed, is no more foreign; and the Christians have been called for two thousand years, Masihi.\nWhat I want to point out is that Jesus had no idea, not at all, what a Christian is, what a christ is. He had never heard those words. In that sense Nietzsche’s statement is not right. In the same reference I would like to say to you: although I have heard the word Rajneeshee, I am neither the first nor the last.\nI don’t belong to any group, any religion, any organization. Even in your commune I am an outsider, just a guest – a guest of Rajneeshees.\nI am not a Rajneeshee.\nA Christian is comparable to a Hindu, to a Jew, to a Buddhist, to a Jaina, to a communist even, because they all believe in tight organizations. They all believe in one leader, one prophet, one messiah, one God, one holy book. Nietzsche’s statement cannot be applied to me because as far as Rajneeshism is concerned there is no God, there is no holy book, there is no messiah.\nI am not a messiah.\nTo be a messiah, first a God is needed.\nI have left myself without a leg to stand on by declaring that there is no God. Now I cannot declare myself a messiah; that possibility is closed. It is God who sends messiahs and messengers – and now there is nobody.\nThere is nobody above me and there is nobody below me.\nThere are only two ways to be superior. Either you are sent from high above, from the great boss, as Jesus is sent, as Mohammed is sent.They come from the great boss, with all the powers invested\nin them. That is one way to declare yourself superior to others. All are not begotten sons of God, it is only Jesus. All are not messiahs, it is only Jesus.\nJesus is declaring his superiority: you are just sheep; he is the shepherd. He is the only shepherd; amongst millions of sheep, the only shepherd. I don’t like such company. Millions of sheep and I am the only shepherd? What kind of company is this? – and you are judged by your company. Even if you are a shepherd it is not much to brag about, but it is a way to prove yourself superior.\nThe other way is followed by the Buddhists and the Jainas, because neither of them believe in God, so that possibility is closed. They have found another possibility, and that is the tirthankara – the Jaina equivalent to the messiah – who is not sent by God, because there is no God, but who attains to the same state of cosmic consciousness through millions of lives’ effort. You are millions of lives behind him, below him. It will take millions of lives for you to be able to reach that state.\nThat is the other way of declaring superiority – perhaps far better a way, because it is so arduous. To become a messiah all that you need is a retarded mind, stupid, stubborn – and you can declare yourself\nAnd to declare yourself the only begotten son of God, what do you need? Just no sense of shame, that’s all; otherwise such stupid thingsAny intelligent person, even if he is the only begotten son\nof God, will try to hide the fact: if somebody hears, what are people going to think about it?\nEven if he knows that he is a messenger from God he will not tell anybody. He will deliver the message and escape because it looks so foolish that you are the son of a poor carpenter, uneducated, and you have been chosen to be the messenger of God.\nGod could not find an educated, sophisticated rabbi? – and there were thousands! In fact rabbis are some of the most scholarly people in the world. God seems to be crazy: He should have chosen somebody refined, cultured, knowing all the scriptures, but Jesus was not even able to read. And there were people whose whole life was devoted to study, to thinking, to contemplation – it was a traditional thing.\nJudaism and Hinduism are the only two basic religions in the world. Other religions are offshoots either of Hinduism or of Judaism, but Judaism and Hinduism remain separate. There is no connection between them, no communication has happened between them; and both are tremendously scholarly.\nIf God chooses Krishna as an incarnation it can be understood. Krishna has that understanding, wisdom, education – the best that was available was available to him; the most famous teachers were his teachers. He was trained to be a wise man, and he was a wise man.\nAnd there were so many rabbis commenting on the TORAH; and such intelligent commentaries that if you look at those commentaries even today you will find them immensely contemporary. Perhaps they are three thousand years old but so insightful and so beautiful. Small statements in the TORAH or the TALMUD have been made in the rabbis’ commentaries, so significant that when you see the statement by itself, you think there is not much in it.\nBut when you see the commentaries and commentaries upon the commentaries, you become aware of the immense dimensions opening from that stale statement. There was nothing in it – you could not have found anything in it – but these commentators have some third eye. They go on looking –\nsomething like an X-ray – and they go to the very depth. Perhaps they create the depth: they are so creative that they bring something significant out of an absolutely insignificant statement. God should have chosen these people, not a carpenter’s son.\nBut Jesus proclaimed himself to be the messenger of God. He must have looked like a buffoon. I can’t help saying it. He used to travel on a donkey declaring himself the only begotten son of God. The messiah that you have been waiting for for centuries is coming on a donkey!\nPeople must have laughed. In the beginning he was just a laughingstock – yes, it was funny – but this man went on and on. Soon people started realizing that it was no longer funny, it was becoming a serious business because Jesus was gathering a few idiots around him who were saying that he was the messiah.\nAnd there was, as there has always been, a class of people who are rejected by the society: thieves, prostitutes, gamblers, tax collectors. These people are rejected people; and these were the people who Jesus collected. It was easy to collect them because they were rejected by the society and Jesus was rejected by the society. They had found a great messiah – “so let’s join him.” Not a single rabbi went with Jesus. This is strange; this has never happened anywhere else.\nBuddha was speaking against brahmins, against Hindus, but all his great disciples were brahmins. It seems sensible because he was appealing to the best in the society. Although he was against brahmins, the brahmins were the topmost, and out of the brahmins came the greater part of intelligentsia.\nSariputta was a brahmin, Moggalayan was a brahmin, Mahakashyapa was a brahmin. They all had come to Buddha, not because they were illiterate idiots, the rejected – gamblers, prostitutes, tax collectors, thieves – no, but because they were great scholars and they could understand that what Buddha was saying was right. And they were not nobodies.\nWhen Sariputta came to Buddha, he himself had five hundred disciples of his own coming with him – all great scholars. He had come first to have a discussion, and Buddha was very happy: what could be more welcome? But Buddha asked, “Have you experienced the truth or are you only a great scholar? – I have heard your name.”\nLooking at Buddha for a moment in silence, as if looking in a mirror, utterly naked, Sariputta said, “I am a great scholar, but as far as knowing the truth is concerned, I have not known it.”\nBuddha said, “Then it will be very difficult to argue. Argument is possible between two people who don’t know truth. They can argue till eternity because neither knows. Both are ignorant so they can go on playing with words and logic and quotations and scriptures, but because neither knows, there is no possibility of their coming to a conclusion. At the most what can happen is whoever is more clever and cunning and tricky may defeat the other, and the other will become the follower of the more cunning or more sophisticated. But is this any decision about truth?\n“Or there is a possibility of a meeting of two people who both have realized the truth, but then there is no way to argue. What is there to argue about? They will sit silently, perhaps they may smile, or hold each other’s hands, but what is there to say? Looking into each other’s eyes they will see that\nthere is nothing to say – we both know the same things, we are in the same space – so there will be only silence.\n“Or the third possibility is that one knows and one does not know. Then it is going to be very troublesome because the one who knows cannot translate what he knows into the language of the ignorant one. And the one who does not know will be unnecessarily wasting his time, his mind, because he cannot convince the one who knows. The whole world cannot convince the person who knows, because he knows and you don’t know. You may be all together”\nBuddha said, “You have come with your five hundred disciples. You don’t know, and it is absolutely certain that in these five hundred disciples no one knows; otherwise he would not be your disciple, he would be your Master. You are more scholarly, they are less scholarly. You are older, they are younger. They are your disciples.\n“But how are we going to discuss anything? I am ready, but I know. One thing is certain: You cannot convert me. The only possibility is that you will be converted, so think twice.” But Sariputta was already converted. Seeing this man.And he was intelligent enough, he had defeated many great\nscholars.\nIt was a tradition in India in those days, that scholars would move all over the country defeating other scholars. Unless a person had defeated all the scholars, he would not be recognized by the scholarly mob as a wise man. But to stand before a Buddha, before one who knowsIt is not a\nquestion of your scholarship and how many scholars you have defeated.\nAnd Buddha simply said, “I am ready. If you want to argue I am ready, but what argument is possible? I have eyes, you don’t have eyes: I cannot explain to you what light is. You cannot have any idea what light is. You will hear only the word light but the word will not have any meaning for you. It will be contentless, heard – but not understood.\n“So if you are really interested in truth, and not in getting defeated or being victoriousbecause\nthat is not my interest. I have arrived. Who cares to defeat anybody? For what? If you are really interested in truth then just be here and do what I say. You can argue later on when you have come to know something substantial, existential. Then you can argue.”\nBut Sariputta was a tremendously intelligent man. He said, “I know that neither I can argue now, nor will I be able to argue then. You have finished my argumentation. Now I cannot argue because I don’t have eyes; then I will not be able to argue because I will have eyes. But I am going to stay.”\nHe stayed with his five hundred disciples. He said to the disciples, “Now I am no longer your master. Here is the man; I will be sitting by his side as his disciple. Please forget me as your master. If you want to be here, he is your Master.”\nNow if a man like Buddha could have said, “I am a messenger of God,” he would not have been laughed at. But he didn’t say that because he and Mahavira were contemporaries and both had an absolute trust in their experience that there is no God. But they found another way.\nTo me it is the same. Whether you descend from above; then you are special.They ascend from\nbelow and go on above you, so far away. Millions of lives you will have to work and then you will be able to reach that state – it is almost impossible.\nI cannot declare myself a messiah because there is no God.\nI cannot declare myself a tirthankara or an avatara, because to me truth is not obtained by arduous effort in millions of lives.\nTruth can be attained instantly, immediately, herenow, because you have it already. So it is not a question of achieving it; you have not to go somewhere to find it.\nYou are carrying truth within you all the time. It is just that you are not awake.\nBut awakening does not need millions of lives.\nJust a good hit on your head and you will be awake – more than awake.\nSo I don’t see myself superior to you. I don’t see anybody inferior to me; I don’t see anybody superior to me either – neither Jesus, nor Buddha, nor Mahavira. I don’t see them as superior to me, because it is such a simple human experience. Why make so much ado about nothing? Somehow even in Mahavira and Buddha some shadow of the ego is still persisting. They have arrived but they are not whole. Perhaps a leg is missing, a hand is missing; something is missing, something is left behind.\nPakhtoonistan is a very small country between Pakistan and Afghanistan, almost a part of Afghanistan. Once it was a part of India; now legally it is part of Pakistan. But the Pakhtoons don’t want to be part of Pakistan, they want to be part of India; and if that is not possible they want.… Because now, Pakistan is in between. They are Mohammedans but a different race.\nThe Pakhtoon is a really beautiful man, perhaps the tallest in the whole world, the strongest in the whole world, and lives longest in the whole world. You will not find a single Pakhtoon who is fat – they are so proportionate and so tall and so beautiful, as if sculptured by someone like Leonardo da Vinci. They don’t want to mix with Pakistan, they would rather be together with Afghanistan.\nThese tribal people have a strange idea. I am reminded of it because I said that it is as if Buddha has left something behind, as if Mahavira has left something behind. Pakhtoons believe that when a man dies he should die with his body complete. No part should be missing because God will ask, “Where is your hand? – because when I sent you into the world you were whole.” So they never allow any operation, any amputation. They would rather die than have their kidneys taken out, because they are simple people, primitive people, and their logic is simple: when God asks, “Where are your kidneys?...”\nA beautiful story happened. In Lahore, a Pakhtoon, in the first world war, got shot in the hand. The situation was such that if his hand was not cut off, then his whole body would be poisoned. The decision had to be taken immediately, because even a few moments delay and it would be too late. The Pakhtoon himself was unconscious, in a coma. His family was somewhere in Pakhtoonistan and difficult to find, because Pakhtoonistan still has no postal system, no telegraph, no telegrams, no telephones, no roads.\nOnly one road passes from Pakistan to Afghanistan, and even to pass through that road is very difficult because Pakhtoon children go on practicing shooting – shooting drivers, shooting passengers in the buses! They are very primitive and simple people. Where to learn? They don’t think of making a target – and what is the point when there are so many targets?\nWhen I was traveling in Pakhtoonistan, my driver said, “I won’t allow you to drive here.” I said, “Why? It is such a beautiful country.”\nHe said, “You don’t know: drivers are just targets! I won’t allow you. You sit in the other seat, the passenger’s seat; I will have to drive. I have driven on this road so I know where the danger is and how to avoid it and what to do. They are continually shooting – just children. From the very childhood all that they want is a gun.”\nSo where to find his family to get their consent to cut his hand off? And he is a Pakhtoon: when he comes back to consciousness and finds that his hand is missing, he is going to create trouble. But there was no other way. The doctor, who was an Englishman, said, “I take the responsibility. I know the man and I will convince him somehow. Cut off his hand.”\nWhen the man came back to consciousness he was really furious. The doctor listened to his anger then explained to him that the situation was this: “I have taken the whole responsibility, and look, I have preserved your hand.” He had kept the hand in a big jar full of spirit. He said, “I have preserved it, so when you die we will put your hand with you.”\nThey are simple people; he understood the logic. He said, “That’s right. What else could you have done? That’s perfectly good. So you keep it, because we Pakhtoons are continually traveling.”\nThey used to travel all over India because from Pakhtoonistan they used to bring dry fruits – the best grow in Pakhtoonistan – and woolen clothes: blankets, sweaters. These two things they would carry from Pakhtoonistan to India to sell.\nReally, since Pakistan has been divided you don’t see Pakhtoons coming into India. You don’t get that quality of dried fruits that they used to bring. It was the most superior you could get anywhere.\nSo he said, “I am continually traveling. Now, to carry this hand everywhere will look odd. Secondly, I may forget it. It may get dropped somewhere. It is in a glass thing – it may be broken. You keep it, and I will tell my family that when I die they should get the hand from you.”\nThe doctor said, “That’s perfectly okay.”\nBut an accident happened: the hospital got burned, and with it, the hand of the Pakhtoon. But the doctor was not very worried about it because he was being retired and was going back to England, so far away from Pakhtoonistan that those people could not bother him in any possible way. Who was the doctor and where had he gone? Where were they going to find him? And they could not go to England, they were poor people.\nBut he was afraid that even in England, who knows? – those people are dangerous. They may find some way... so it is better to keep a hand ready, in case. But he forgot that he had cut off the left\nhand. He got a right hand from a hospital and kept it preserved in his bedroom so that if some time somebody came.…\nThe story is that one night somebody knocked on the door. The doctor opened the door and the Pakhtoon was standing there, furious. The doctor could not believe his eyes. The Pakhtoon didn’t say anything, he simply showed him his left arm and asked, “Where is my hand?” – not verbally; he just showed him his arm: “Give me my hand.”\nThe doctor almost had a nervous breakdown. He just got hold of the flask and took it out. At that moment he realized the mistake, that it was the right hand! And the Pakhtoon seeing it, kicked the flask over, took the hand and threw it into the room. He said, “Tomorrow night I will come again. You find my hand!”\nPerhaps the second part of the story is psychological. For the doctor this became a nightmare. Every night.The doctor gets into this insane idea that the Pakhtoon has died. Perhaps somebody\nfrom Lahore – a colleague, another doctor – has informed him that the Pakhtoon has died, and to be aware. Perhaps it is only his own imagination, but he thinks he sees the ghost of the Pakhtoon. Whatever the case – I don’t believe in ghosts, but you can imagine.…\nIf you can imagine God, why not a ghost? – just a very small creature. If you can see Jesus and Krishna and Buddha, then there is no problem: you can hallucinate just a poor Pakhtoon. And there was cause enough – the doctor had broken his word.\nPakhtoons are very truthful. If they give a promise they will fulfill it whatsoever the cost. Even for a small thing they will risk their life; if they have promised, they will do it. So he was afraid perhaps because of that. The doctor had lived amongst Pakhtoons in Lahore and he knew what kind of people they are: even after death.And particularly in England, ghosts appear more than\nanywhere else.\nEngland is somehow very attractive to ghosts. There are proportionately more houses in England than in any country which are haunted by ghosts. Britain has a certain magnetism for ghosts. Perhaps that is why British people look so serious, afraid.\nDon’t start a conversation with Proper Sagar unless you are properly introduced before. Perhaps there is also a fear of getting into conversation with a ghost: you don’t know who he is. If somebody you know introduces you, then it is okay; otherwise who knows who is who? This doctor must have been a Proper Sagar.\nThe story is that he died because of this continual nightmare. One morning he was found dead. He must have thought that the Pakhtoon had pressed on his neck and throat, but actually he was pressing on his own throat; and in the morning, when he was found, he had killed himself. But he must have thought, hallucinated, got into the idea and killed himself. He must have died thinking that the Pakhtoon was killing him! But the idea of the Pakhtoon, that you should be whole when you go back, is significant.\nAnd Buddha has left something behind: he is still somehow saying to you that he is higher. He declares that he has attained the highest cosmic consciousness, which nobody had ever attained before.\nNow, this is the same game, played more sophisticatedly. But what he is trying to do is the same as what Jesus is trying to do in saying that, “I am the only begotten son of God. Nobody was before, nobody is going to be afterwards; I am the only son.” He is making his place superior forever. Buddha is doing the same; of course he says that he is coming from millions of lives.\nIn one life he was an elephant – but then too he was superior. He tells the story that when he was an elephant the jungle caught fire. The fire was spreading so fast, and the wind was so strong, that all the animals were running out of the jungle. He was also running, but finding a big shady tree he stood there just to rest a little in the coolness of the shadow.\nAs he was just going to move and had lifted up one of his feet, a small rabbit, running in just the same fear of the fire, also came under the shadow of the tree, and rested there just where the elephant was going to put his foot. Now, to put his foot down would kill the rabbit, but not to put his foot... how long could he stand on three feet? And you should understand: an elephant standing on three feet is a really heavy job, just the one foot up is enoughl\nBut Buddha said, “I kept my foot up and saved the life of the rabbit, although because of balancing that great a load I tumbled and fell sideways and died. But because I had done that good deed, I was born as a man.”\nNow, even while he was an elephant he was a superior elephant, not an ordinary elephant; otherwise I don’t think any elephant is going to be bothered by a rabbit. In the first place he won’t even see if the rabbit is there. Elephants are big but their eyes are very small. Have you seen that strange combination? – such small eyes in such a big animal. Who is creating these designs? A little proportion is needed. Or do you think the elephant can see the rabbit who is just sitting underneath his feet? I think it will take long yoga practice for the elephant to look down; it is not easy for an elephant to look that far down.\nJust draw a picture of an elephant – I have drawn one and I have tried in every possible way to imagine myself as the elephant, but I couldn’t see the rabbit. The foot is there, and the rabbit is underneath the foot – but such small eyes in such a big body... it is just not possible.\nEven in his elephant life Buddha was so non-violent, non-hurting, that he preferred his own death rather than killing a rabbit. He tells many stories of his past lives, and in every life he is superior. That superiority continues even into this last life: now he is the suprememost enlightened man.\nFor you it will take millions of lives – you may not yet be at the stage of the elephant. Would you be ready to die to save a rabbit? You won’t be even ready to save your wife – particularly your wife, because married life is such that people say to each other.…\nOne lover was saying to his beloved, “Without you I will die, I can’t breathe. Without you I can’t see any meaning in life. Without seeing you, my whole day becomes dark and dismal, but on the days I see you I am so full of joy that I can see stars even in the daytime.”\nWomen are more practical; they don’t listen to all this garbage. She knew that he must have learned this dialogue that he was speaking from some film or somewhere. She said, “What about tomorrow? Are you coming tomorrow?”\nHe said, “If it does not rain – because I don’t have my umbrella repaired yet.” Poetry is one thing, but when things come to reality then it is a totally different world.\nBuddha is trying to prove himself not only higher than YOUHe tells the story, “When I became\nenlightened all three Hindu gods” Just like the Christian trinity, Hinduism has the trimurti, the three\nfaces of God – one body but three faces. It looks almost more logical than the Christian trinity – God the Father, the Holy Ghost, and Jesus Christ the Son.\nThis trinity looks a very incomplete family: there is no mother, no brothers, no sisters. And the story is so old that it must have been a joint family. In those days such a nuclear family – only one son, and that too without a wife! Great birth control – even the wife is dropped. It doesn’t seem that it can be real.\nThe Hindu God seems to have some logic behind it: one body, three faces. Brahma is the creative face who creates the world; Vishnu is the sustainer, who sustains the world; and Shiva is the destructive part, who destroys the world. This seems to be more logical, perhaps more scientific too.\nIt is a strange thing: science goes on dividing and dividing – molecules have been divided into atoms and atoms themselves have been divided – and the ultimate division science has arrived at is into three. One is positive, that can be the creative part; the other is neutral, that can be the sustainer part; the third is destructive, negative, that can be the third face of the Hindu God.\nSooner or later Hindus are going to brag that this is what their three faces mean – electron, neutron, proton – that this is the new way of saying the same thing; but it is one body, it is the same electricity, the same force. What does Buddha manage to do with this? He says, “When I became enlightened all three Hindu gods, Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh – all three came to touch my feet.”\nNow, this is even better than Jesus. Jesus after all is just a son. Buddha manages to have all the three Hindu gods touch his feet, because those three gods say, “The enlightened being is far higher than God. We also desire, in some life, to gain the same state of being.”\nIn Hinduism, gods are not permanent beings. They have a certain period of time in heaven that they have earned through being good in the world, a certain bank balance of virtue. They will live in heaven till that bank balance is finished. Once it is finished they are thrown back into the world, again on the road – in the wheel of life and death. The enlightened being does not go to heaven, he goes to moksha.\nMoksha is above heaven, from where no fall is possible, because it doesn’t happen through virtue or good deeds, it happens through awareness, total awareness. And once you are totally aware, how can you fall? So Buddha uses a far more clever strategy to prove himself superior. Mahavira uses it in the same way. A tirthankara becomes a tirthankara through millions of lives of arduous austerities; and there are only twenty-four tirthankaras in one cycle of creation.\nOnly recently has Western physics become aware of such immense spans of time, but Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism have been aware of them for a long time. In English you cannot find the equivalent to many numbers which are available in Indian languages. One cycle is not a small thing\nbut of millions and millions of years. Creation does not begin like Christians say – which looks very childish – four thousand and four years before Jesus Christ.\nNow, the Eastern people will laugh and say, “Whom are you kidding? Creation happened four thousand and four years before Christ?” China has been for at least ten thousand years. India has been, according to Indian scholars, for at least ninety thousand years.\nIf you don’t believe them it is difficult to argue against their argument because in the RIG VEDA the Hindus have a description of stars in a certain combination which happened – according to scientific astronomers – ninety thousand years ago. If that particular combination of stars was known to the people who were writing the RIG VEDA, it is enough proof that the RIG VEDA is far older than ninety thousand years.\nEven if the RIG VEDA was written later on, at least in the memory of the people that particular combination of stars was kept in mind – and the RIG VEDA says it happened exactly ninety thousand years ago. Their book is ninety thousand years old; your creation is only six thousand years old – from today. So it is very difficult to argue that it is not so. Hindus will laugh and say, “What are you talking about?”\nJainas are even more mathematical. In the RIG VEDA, their first tirthankara’s name is mentioned. That becomes even more complicated a problem because their first tirthankara, Rishabadeva, is mentioned by name with great respect.\nIt is very logical: to show so much respect to a person who is against your religion makes one thing certain – he can’t be contemporary. These are simple, logical ways to think. In the first place, if somebody is your contemporary, you are full of contempt towards the man – perhaps that is the meaning of contemporary – you cannot believe in him.\nThat’s why they could not believe in Jesus Christ. They couldn’t believe in him. When Buddha was contemporary, Hindus did not recognize him. But five hundred years after he died they had to recognize him as one of the Hindu incarnations of God because his influence had grown so much. Now to reject him meant to reject all the Buddhists. That would have been a great loss to the Hindu priesthood. It was better to absorb them, to keep them under the Hindu fold so that you could go on exploiting them; otherwise they would move apart.\nSo for five hundred years Hindus were continually criticizing Buddha, but after five hundred years they changed their tactics, their strategy. Up to that time they had only ten incarnations of God, and there was no room to allow for Buddha, but Buddhists wouldn’t agree for any lesser position than that. So they had to increase the quota! Five hundred years after Buddha, the Hindus changed and started saying, “If we have twenty-four avataras... just as Jainas have twentyfour tirthankaras and Buddhists have twenty-four Buddhas, we also have twenty-four avataras.”\nGautam Buddha was born in a Hindu family, obviously – just like Jesus was born in a Jewish family – so he was a Hindu, and he died as a Hindu. They reclaimed him and declared him one of the incarnations of the Hindu God. But for the contemporary Buddha there was nothing but contempt.\nIt is so common a practice all over the world – that you can respect a man who is dead, and the longer he is dead, the better. If he is outside the scope of your history then you can respect him very easily, then there is no problem at all. He is so distant from you, it does not hurt.\nBut somebody sitting by your side declaring himself the only begotten son of God! You cannot believe this guy – perspiring, stinking – is the only begotten son of God. You feel like kicking him! The only son of God? You feel angry at him, at God, at everything that this man.But after two\nthousand years have passed nobody is worried; nobody seems to be concerned whether Jesus was really the son of God.\nChristians have accepted it but Jews don’t talk about him. Mohammedans have accepted him because they have no problem about him. Hindus, Jainas, Buddhists, have no trouble with Jesus. You cannot convert a single Jaina to Christianity, or a single Buddhist to Christianity, because Christianity is a far more primitive religion. Those people are far superior in their arguments and their logic.\nMany Christians have become Buddhists; not a single Buddhist becomes Christian. There is nothing in it to appeal to them. Do you think a Bud\u0026ist will be impressed by the fact that Jesus is the son of the virgin, Mary? He will simply laugh; he will say, “You are joking!” What has Christianity got?\nOne Christian missionary went, with his BIBLE, to see a Zen Master. He started reading the Sermon on the Mount, of course; that is the best part. In fact that’s all that Christianity is about. He had read only one or two sentences when the Zen monk said, “Stop. Whoever the guy was, he was a bodhisattva” – bodhisattva means in some future life he will become a buddha. “Be finished! These sentences are proof enough that in some future life this guy is going to become a buddha. But don’t be bothered with him, he is not a buddha right now – only a bodhisattva.”\nBodhisattva means essentially a buddha, but everybody is a bodhisattva essentially. You may take lives to make your essence actual; that depends on you, but you are a buddha. Not only you, the trees, the birds, even the dogs are essentially bodhisattvas. They may take a little longer, or maybe some intelligent dog rushes ahead and leaves you behind. It is happening: all intelligent dogs have come to Oregon. They have made a party – 1000 Friends of Oregon. They are known as watchdogs!\nI was wondering why they are called watchdogs. Finally the revelation came to me that they are dogs, but very intelligent. Most of them are in the legal profession; they have changed themselves into watchdogs. Even dogs, even watchdogs of Oregon are bodhisattvas. So that Zen Master was not saying much, but that missionary was overjoyed. And the story was being told all over, in Christian churches that a Zen Master had accepted Jesus; but the missionary did not understand the meaning of bodhisattva.\nBodhisattva does not mean buddha. Sattva means essence, potentially; but potentiality may always remain a potentiality – there is no necessity for a seed to become a tree. A seed may remain just a seed forever – there are different types of seed. Some seed may choose to sit upon a rock. You can go on meditating sitting on a rock, but you are not going to become a buddha. On a rock a seed will remain a seed.\nTo become a tree the seed has to die into the earth, dissolve itself completely; on its death is the birth of the tree. Its death is absolutely essential. Here it dies, and on the other side the tree is born, a small sprout, but alive. The seed was almost dead. I say “almost” because it had the potential of life. But a seed can remain a seed – and millions of seeds do remain seeds.\nSo it was nothing much; that Zen Master really joked with the missionary. He said, “Stop, enough! Those two lines are enough. Whosoever said it.” He did not even bother to ask who had said it.\nHe said, “Whosoever has said it, he is a bodhisattva. Close the book – now talk business.” I am not the first Rajneeshee or the last Rajneeshee.\nI am not a Rajneeshee at all. I am just an outsider.\nYou may be Rajneeshees, but don’t drag me into your Big Muddy Ranch. You enjoy the Big Muddy Ranch – leave me outside.\nI am just a guest, because in the first place I don’t want to be crucified – no interest in it at all. I don’t want to be deified – no interest in it at all.\nWhatever I am is so fulfilling that I don’t see any need to be something else. I don’t see anybody superior to me, I don’t see anybody inferior to me.\nIn fact both those things exist together. Anybody who thinks somebody is superior must think somebody else inferior, and vice versa: if you think somebody is inferior to you, you are bound to think of somebody as superior. It is the same mind; and those two dimensions are not two dimensions but two polarities of the same thing.\nI am simply out of it. I am just not playing that game of being superior and inferior.\nIf you are really interested in what I am doing and saying and being, then never let “Rajneeshee” become something like Christian, Hindu, Mohammedan, no. Never get serious about it. It is just a word to demarcate.\nIt is not a creed, a cult, a dogma that you have to fight for, that you have to go on a crusade for. No, – you need not become Don Quixotes – you are not to convert anybody.\nRajneeshee is simply a name.\nSome name is needed, X, Y, Z, anything will do, just to give you a demarcation. You are not Hindus, you are not Mohammedans, you are not Christians. People are going to ask, “Then who are you?”\nI have never voted. My name is not even on the census reports in India because whenever the census people came there was a clause which had to be filled out: To which religion do you belong? I said, “This is difficult – I don’t belong to any religion.” But they insisted the form had to be filled out completely, only then was it acceptable. I said, “Forget about it. Don’t accept it – I don’t care about it. Your form is your business. Just get lostl I am not going to fill in that clause because that would be a lie: I don’t belong to any religion.”\nBut those poor people insisted, You must belong to something. If you are an atheist you can say, ‘I am an atheist.’”\nBut I am not an atheist. I am not obsessed with the idea that there is no God, and I am not after Him. If there is no God why should I be after Him? And why should I call myself an atheist when there is no God?\nTheism is belief in God. Atheism is disbelief in God. My God! – disbelief in God?\nI told these people, “I don’t believe, I don’t disbelieve: I simply have nothing to do with God.” They said then, “But you must be doing some prayer.”\nI said, “Never. I have never done any prayer. Why should I do any prayer?” And they were almost angry at this. Once it happened that they had come to my house and went away very angry. Then they came to the university, but they did not recognize me because in the house I had been simply sitting with a lungi on, my body half-naked, and in the college I had on a robe. So they could not figure out that I was the same person: again they brought out the form.\nI said, “Listen, if you show me this form again I am going to hit you really hard.” They said, “Again? but we have never met.”\nI said, “You have forgotten. That guy who was” Then they looked again and they said, “Yes, that’s\ntrue. Now we will be continually aware of beards. We may come across you again somewhere.”\nI was at that time really strong – one hundred and ninety pounds – and I was running eight miles every day, morning and evening, whenever I could find time. So that when I said to anybody, “I will hit you hard,” they understood it would be hard.\nI had enjoyed jumping, running, swimming so much that my family was always worried: “Will you do anything else in life or not? And you create such a nuisance for other people.”\nI said, “But I simply do my thing. I don’t get in anybody’s way.” But they had something at hand – some report had arrived. So they said, “This is not true. This morning at four o’clock, what business did you have that you were running backwards? We know there are people who go running, but BACKWARDS?”\nThe place where I lived was in the most beautiful area – with big, tall trees and a long row of bamboos, so it was always shadowy near the bamboos. It was a full moon night, and I was just doing my exercises by the side of those bamboos. It is more joyous to run backwards because you are moving into the unknown; you can’t see what might happen. And at four o’clock the street was almost empty. But there is an Indian belief that ghosts walk backwards.…\nThere was a man who used to live at the corner of the road who had a small tea shop. He used to get very afraid, but only in the beginning. Then I went to him and told him, “You need not be afraid:\nI am a man, I am not a ghost, and every morning you see me; so once and for all be settled about it and go on sleeping – don’t get disturbed.”\nBut what happened that day was that the milk man.They come early in the morning because they\nbring milk from nearby villages with two big drums full of milk on a bicycle. The milkman was coming along the road when suddenly he saw me. He lost his balance and fell from the bicycle. Because the drums fell and made so much noise, I turned back wondering, What is the matter? I saw the bicycle, the drums and the milk all over the road. And the man running far away!\nI simply forgot that it was not good to follow him. I just wanted to help him and tell him that I was not a ghost, so I followed him. And because I was always running he could not escape me. When he saw me coming behind him, he simply fell down, unconscious. And I was trying to tell him.…\nBy that time the man who lived at the corner came and said, “Look, this is what used to happen to me. And if he fell from his bicycle, what business was it of yours to follow him?”\nI said, “I was simply trying to help – so that he was sure that I am a man.” He said, “Now have you made sure? Now he has almost become a ghost!”\nThat report had reached my family and that was why they were saying: “This is not right. You should not get in people’s way.”\nThose census officers said, “Sir” – because there they were respectful to a university professor. At my house I was in the garden, digging a hole. There they were very angry with me, thinking me a gardener or somebody who was just talking absurdities in saying that he could not fill in this line. In the university they said, “Sir, one thing please remember: if we come across you again, you remind us and we will simply leave. We will not say anything.”\nSo my name does not exist on the Indian voters’ list. I have not voted in my whole life because my name never appeared on the voters’ list. It was not in the census list even, for the simple reason that I could not say what my religion was.\nYou are fortunate, you can say what your religion is. But it is not to be taken seriously. You are not to fight for it.\nYou are not to die for it.\nYou have to live it, enjoy it, relish it. And please, leave me out of it!\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"9426","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/from_personality_to_individuality/part10/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/from_personality_to_individuality/>From Personality to Individuality</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">10 Christianity: just a nice Jewish boy\'s hang-up</h1><div class=post-meta>45 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;9426 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/From_Personality_to_Individuality/part10.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part9>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

ARE YOU THE LAST RAJNEESHEE?
PLEASE EXPLAIN.</p><p><br></p><p>IT was not me who said that Christ was the last Christian. I was
simply quoting Friedrich Nietzsche; it was Nietzsche who made that
statement. In a certain sense Nietzsche is absolutely right, because in
this world no individual is ever repeated.</p><p><br></p><p>The uniqueness of the individual is absolute.</p><p><br></p><p>Not only in contemporary times is nobody like you; in the whole of
eternity there is never going to be a person like you again. There has
never been a person like you before. You are simply you,
incomparable.</p><p><br></p><p>Hence I support Nietzsche’s statement in this sense, that the last
Christian was crucified two thousand years ago. But I would like to add
something more to it.</p><p><br></p><p>First: Jesus was not only the last Christian, he was also the first
Christian – the first and the last Christian.</p><p><br></p><p>But this is only one sense of the statement. In other ways I am not
in agreement with it, because as far as the word Christian is concerned
– Jesus never even heard the word.</p><p>He was born a Jew, he lived as a Jew; he tried his whole life to
prove himself to be a real Jew. In fact he was crucified because he was
trying to prove himself to be a Jewish messiah. He had never heard the
words christ or christian because he knew no Greek, no Latin; he knew
only Aramaic and a little bit of Hebrew. And both languages have the
word messiah, but christ is a Greek translation of the word messiah.</p><p><br></p><p>The word christ came into existence after Jesus, after three hundred
years had passed; and out of the word christ comes christian. Slowly
people completely forgot that poor Christ had no idea that he would be
called Christ and his followers, Christians.</p><p><br></p><p>You will be surprised to know that in India the Hindi word for
messiah is masiha, and the word for christian is masihi. Masihi is far
closer to the Aramaic and Hebrew than what the Christians all over the
world go on calling themselves.</p><p><br></p><p>Perhaps the Hindi words masiha and masihi came into existence because
Jesus, after escaping from the crucifixion – it was not a resurrection,
it was an escape – lived in India for really a long time, to the age of
one hundred and twelve years. His most beloved disciple, Thomas,
followed him.</p><p><br></p><p>Indian Christianity is the oldest in the whole world. The Vatican is
a late development. Jesus remained in Kashmir completely tired, perhaps
finished with humanity and the hope for some better future for it,
because if this was the result – that you crucify a person who works for
you and for your redemption, your salvation.<span class=s4></span>Of
course he was not an idiot: he learned the lesson.</p><p><br></p><p>For the remaining time Jesus stayed silent. Yes, a few people came to
him on their own. But it was not a problem because in India there have
been so many incarnations of God, and it is an accepted fact that it is
nobody else’s business: if somebody feels he is an incarnation of God,
let him be.</p><p><br></p><p>What is wrong in it? Somewhere else the same person will be
crucified, will be imprisoned; he will be psychoanalyzed, deprogrammed.
All kinds of stupid things will be done to the person because he thinks
he is an incarnation of God, but in India he will be worshipped.</p><p><br></p><p>Nobody will object to it. There is no question of objecting, because
one thing is certain: that you cannot judge whether he is or he is not;
there are no criteria, no methods to measure. And India has seen so many
people like Jesus that it has come to realize that each one of them was
so unique that you cannot derive any criteria from one which can be
applied to another.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha was just himself. No similarity between Buddha and Krishna can
be found; everything in them is just the opposite to each other. But
India has lived thousands of years of religious philosophizing,
teaching, arguing. It has attained to a certain liberality of mind as
far as religion is concerned.</p><p><br></p><p>India knows that a Krishna can be an incarnation of God, although he
lives in a palace with every luxury; Buddha can be an incarnation of God
although he renounces his kingdom, luxuries, comforts; Mahavira can be
an incarnation of God, although he discards even his clothes and lives
naked.</p><p><br></p><p>India has seen so many ways of people like Jesus that it has come to
one conclusion: leave the person alone. If you can learn something from
him, good; otherwise there is no harm in paying him</p><p>respect. Perhaps he is right; and if he is wrong, what are you
losing? Giving respect, even to a wrong person, is not bad.</p><p><br></p><p>So in Kashmir Jesus was not troubled by anybody. He was not news
there. In India such people are not news. Thomas, he sent to the south
of India for a special reason. Northern India is very sophisticated, and
all these great teachers, Buddha, Mahavira, Krishna, Patanjali, Gorakh,
Kabir – it is an unending line – were all born and lived in northern
India, for the simple reason that northern India is Aryan.</p><p><br></p><p>South India is non-Aryan, it has negroid blood. Once south India was
just part of South Africa; South Africa has drifted away. Now it is a
late discovery in geography that continents go on drifting, they are
still drifting. The drift is very small, one foot in a year, so you
cannot feel it. But continents are continuously drifting, they are not
fixed: in thousands of years, of course, much change happens.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a great insight of Jesus to send Thomas to South India where
it was possible to preach and spread Jesus’ word. In northern India
nobody would have bothered about it. Northern India was so full of
philosophical reasoning, argumentation; was so sophisticated that
Thomas, a poor, uneducated man – who was going to listen to him?</p><p><br></p><p>But perhaps South India would be receptive; and it was. The whole
state of Kerala is eighty percent Christian; and it is not a new
phenomenon – it was Thomas’ work. Goa is completely Christian – Thomas’
body is still in Goa.</p><p><br></p><p>It reminds me to tell you of one thing: Thomas’ is the only body,
outside Tibet, which is still the same as it was on the day the person
died. It has not been preserved by any chemicals, or by any scientific
methods. It is one of the rarest phenomena on the earth. Every year the
body is brought out of the inner chambers of the church for the public
to see.</p><p><br></p><p>And I have seen the body, and you can see: it is as if the man has
just gone to sleep, and not even died. Yes, he is not breathing, but in
two thousand years the body has not deteriorated. Scientists have tried
to find out how it is preserved. There is nothing to find because it is
not preserved by any preservatives; it is through a long training in
yoga and certain breathing exercises that have the capacity to change
the inner workings of biochemistry.</p><p><br></p><p>For thirty years Thomas practiced yoga. Thomas lived like a Hindu
brahmin. If you see a picture of Thomas you will be surprised. What kind
of Christian is this? – his head shaved like a Hindu brahmin monk, with
a small piece of hair on the top of his head left uncut, the choti. He
even wore a thread, yagyopavit, that is only worn by born brahmins. He
used only a small piece of cloth just to cover the lower part of his
body, the loincloth as it is called.</p><p><br></p><p>If you have seen Mahatma Gandhi’s picture you know the cloth that
just covers him from his waist to his knees – that’s enough. And in the
south they use it just as a wraparound; Thomas used just the wraparound
lungi, only up to the knee. And he used the wooden sandals. He looked a
perfect Hindu.</p><p><br></p><p>He became vegetarian when he was in India. He tried to learn as much
yoga as possible and he really performed a miracle. He said, “After my
death don’t bury my body and don’t make a grave for</p><p>me. I have managed to change its inner workings.” It was predicted by
Thomas – and that prediction may come true – that his body would remain
preserved till the very end of the world. Two thousand years have passed
and the body is preserved. Only last year, for the first time, was a
little sign of deterioration detected. Perhaps the end of the world is
close.</p><p><br></p><p>If the man was right about his body, saying not to destroy it, it is
going to remain till the very end of the world – and according to many
sources the end of the world is coming closer – his prediction may also
be true.</p><p><br></p><p>Only last year, that was 1984, for the first time a little
deterioration appeared. Perhaps by the end of this century the body may
have deteriorated completely. Thomas’ prediction is: the day my body
deteriorates completely, that is the end of this world.</p><p><br></p><p>Thomas and Jesus both brought to India the word messiah which became
masiha. It happens, when a word changes from one language to another
language, it has to be adapted to the whims of the other language.
“Messiah” will not fit in Hindi; “masiha” fits. “Messiah” would have
remained something foreign, but “masiha” is transformed, is no more
foreign; and the Christians have been called for two thousand years,
Masihi.</p><p><br></p><p>What I want to point out is that Jesus had no idea, not at all, what
a Christian is, what a christ is. He had never heard those words. In
that sense Nietzsche’s statement is not right. In the same reference I
would like to say to you: although I have heard the word Rajneeshee, I
am neither the first nor the last.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t belong to any group, any religion, any organization. Even in
your commune I am an outsider, just a guest – a guest of
Rajneeshees.</p><p><br></p><p>I am not a Rajneeshee.</p><p><br></p><p>A Christian is comparable to a Hindu, to a Jew, to a Buddhist, to a
Jaina, to a communist even, because they all believe in tight
organizations. They all believe in one leader, one prophet, one messiah,
one God, one holy book. Nietzsche’s statement cannot be applied to me
because as far as Rajneeshism is concerned there is no God, there is no
holy book, there is no messiah.</p><p><br></p><p>I am not a messiah.</p><p><br></p><p>To be a messiah, first a God is needed.</p><p><br></p><p>I have left myself without a leg to stand on by declaring that there
is no God. Now I cannot declare myself a messiah; that possibility is
closed. It is God who sends messiahs and messengers – and now there is
nobody.</p><p><br></p><p>There is nobody above me and there is nobody below me.</p><p><br></p><p>There are only two ways to be superior. Either you are sent from high
above, from the great boss, as Jesus is sent, as Mohammed is sent.<span class=s4></span>They come from the great boss, with all the powers
invested</p><p>in them. That is one way to declare yourself superior to others. All
are not begotten sons of God, it is only Jesus. All are not messiahs, it
is only Jesus.</p><p>Jesus is declaring his superiority: you are just sheep; he is the
shepherd. He is the only shepherd; amongst millions of sheep, the only
shepherd. I don’t like such company. Millions of sheep and I am the only
shepherd? What kind of company is this? – and you are judged by your
company. Even if you are a shepherd it is not much to brag about, but it
is a way to prove yourself superior.</p><p><br></p><p>The other way is followed by the Buddhists and the Jainas, because
neither of them believe in God, so that possibility is closed. They have
found another possibility, and that is the tirthankara – the Jaina
equivalent to the messiah – who is not sent by God, because there is no
God, but who attains to the same state of cosmic consciousness through
millions of lives’ effort. You are millions of lives behind him, below
him. It will take millions of lives for you to be able to reach that
state.</p><p><br></p><p>That is the other way of declaring superiority – perhaps far better a
way, because it is so arduous. To become a messiah all that you need is
a retarded mind, stupid, stubborn – and you can declare yourself</p><p><br></p><p>And to declare yourself the only begotten son of God, what do you
need? Just no sense of shame, that’s all; otherwise such stupid
things<span class=s4></span>Any intelligent person, even if he is the
only begotten son</p><p>of God, will try to hide the fact: if somebody hears, what are people
going to think about it?</p><p><br></p><p>Even if he knows that he is a messenger from God he will not tell
anybody. He will deliver the message and escape because it looks so
foolish that you are the son of a poor carpenter, uneducated, and you
have been chosen to be the messenger of God.</p><p><br></p><p>God could not find an educated, sophisticated rabbi? – and there were
thousands! In fact rabbis are some of the most scholarly people in the
world. God seems to be crazy: He should have chosen somebody refined,
cultured, knowing all the scriptures, but Jesus was not even able to
read. And there were people whose whole life was devoted to study, to
thinking, to contemplation – it was a traditional thing.</p><p><br></p><p>Judaism and Hinduism are the only two basic religions in the world.
Other religions are offshoots either of Hinduism or of Judaism, but
Judaism and Hinduism remain separate. There is no connection between
them, no communication has happened between them; and both are
tremendously scholarly.</p><p><br></p><p>If God chooses Krishna as an incarnation it can be understood.
Krishna has that understanding, wisdom, education – the best that was
available was available to him; the most famous teachers were his
teachers. He was trained to be a wise man, and he was a wise man.</p><p><br></p><p>And there were so many rabbis commenting on the TORAH; and such
intelligent commentaries that if you look at those commentaries even
today you will find them immensely contemporary. Perhaps they are three
thousand years old but so insightful and so beautiful. Small statements
in the TORAH or the TALMUD have been made in the rabbis’ commentaries,
so significant that when you see the statement by itself, you think
there is not much in it.</p><p><br></p><p>But when you see the commentaries and commentaries upon the
commentaries, you become aware of the immense dimensions opening from
that stale statement. There was nothing in it – you could not have found
anything in it – but these commentators have some third eye. They go on
looking –</p><p>something like an X-ray – and they go to the very depth. Perhaps they
create the depth: they are so creative that they bring something
significant out of an absolutely insignificant statement. God should
have chosen these people, not a carpenter’s son.</p><p><br></p><p>But Jesus proclaimed himself to be the messenger of God. He must have
looked like a buffoon. I can’t help saying it. He used to travel on a
donkey declaring himself the only begotten son of God. The messiah that
you have been waiting for for centuries is coming on a donkey!</p><p><br></p><p>People must have laughed. In the beginning he was just a
laughingstock – yes, it was funny – but this man went on and on. Soon
people started realizing that it was no longer funny, it was becoming a
serious business because Jesus was gathering a few idiots around him who
were saying that he was the messiah.</p><p><br></p><p>And there was, as there has always been, a class of people who are
rejected by the society: thieves, prostitutes, gamblers, tax collectors.
These people are rejected people; and these were the people who Jesus
collected. It was easy to collect them because they were rejected by the
society and Jesus was rejected by the society. They had found a great
messiah – “so let’s join him.” Not a single rabbi went with Jesus. This
is strange; this has never happened anywhere else.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha was speaking against brahmins, against Hindus, but all his
great disciples were brahmins. It seems sensible because he was
appealing to the best in the society. Although he was against brahmins,
the brahmins were the topmost, and out of the brahmins came the greater
part of intelligentsia.</p><p><br></p><p>Sariputta was a brahmin, Moggalayan was a brahmin, Mahakashyapa was a
brahmin. They all had come to Buddha, not because they were illiterate
idiots, the rejected – gamblers, prostitutes, tax collectors, thieves –
no, but because they were great scholars and they could understand that
what Buddha was saying was right. And they were not nobodies.</p><p><br></p><p>When Sariputta came to Buddha, he himself had five hundred disciples
of his own coming with him – all great scholars. He had come first to
have a discussion, and Buddha was very happy: what could be more
welcome? But Buddha asked, “Have you experienced the truth or are you
only a great scholar? – I have heard your name.”</p><p><br></p><p>Looking at Buddha for a moment in silence, as if looking in a mirror,
utterly naked, Sariputta said, “I am a great scholar, but as far as
knowing the truth is concerned, I have not known it.”</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha said, “Then it will be very difficult to argue. Argument is
possible between two people who don’t know truth. They can argue till
eternity because neither knows. Both are ignorant so they can go on
playing with words and logic and quotations and scriptures, but because
neither knows, there is no possibility of their coming to a conclusion.
At the most what can happen is whoever is more clever and cunning and
tricky may defeat the other, and the other will become the follower of
the more cunning or more sophisticated. But is this any decision about
truth?</p><p><br></p><p>“Or there is a possibility of a meeting of two people who both have
realized the truth, but then there is no way to argue. What is there to
argue about? They will sit silently, perhaps they may smile, or hold
each other’s hands, but what is there to say? Looking into each other’s
eyes they will see that</p><p>there is nothing to say – we both know the same things, we are in the
same space – so there will be only silence.</p><p>“Or the third possibility is that one knows and one does not know.
Then it is going to be very troublesome because the one who knows cannot
translate what he knows into the language of the ignorant one. And the
one who does not know will be unnecessarily wasting his time, his mind,
because he cannot convince the one who knows. The whole world cannot
convince the person who knows, because he knows and you don’t know. You
may be all together<span class=s4></span>”</p><p>Buddha said, “You have come with your five hundred disciples. You
don’t know, and it is absolutely certain that in these five hundred
disciples no one knows; otherwise he would not be your disciple, he
would be your Master. You are more scholarly, they are less scholarly.
You are older, they are younger. They are your disciples.</p><p>“But how are we going to discuss anything? I am ready, but I know.
One thing is certain: You cannot convert me. The only possibility is
that you will be converted, so think twice.” But Sariputta was already
converted. Seeing this man.<span class=s4></span>And he was
intelligent enough, he had defeated many great</p><p>scholars.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a tradition in India in those days, that scholars would move
all over the country defeating other scholars. Unless a person had
defeated all the scholars, he would not be recognized by the scholarly
mob as a wise man. But to stand before a Buddha, before one who
knows<span class=s4></span>It is not a</p><p>question of your scholarship and how many scholars you have
defeated.</p><p><br></p><p>And Buddha simply said, “I am ready. If you want to argue I am ready,
but what argument is possible? I have eyes, you don’t have eyes: I
cannot explain to you what light is. You cannot have any idea what light
is. You will hear only the word light but the word will not have any
meaning for you. It will be contentless, heard – but not understood.</p><p>“So if you are really interested in truth, and not in getting
defeated or being victorious<span class=s4></span>because</p><p>that is not my interest. I have arrived. Who cares to defeat anybody?
For what? If you are really interested in truth then just be here and do
what I say. You can argue later on when you have come to know something
substantial, existential. Then you can argue.”</p><p>But Sariputta was a tremendously intelligent man. He said, “I know
that neither I can argue now, nor will I be able to argue then. You have
finished my argumentation. Now I cannot argue because I don’t have eyes;
then I will not be able to argue because I will have eyes. But I am
going to stay.”</p><p>He stayed with his five hundred disciples. He said to the disciples,
“Now I am no longer your master. Here is the man; I will be sitting by
his side as his disciple. Please forget me as your master. If you want
to be here, he is your Master.”</p><p>Now if a man like Buddha could have said, “I am a messenger of God,”
he would not have been laughed at. But he didn’t say that because he and
Mahavira were contemporaries and both had an absolute trust in their
experience that there is no God. But they found another way.</p><p>To me it is the same. Whether you descend from above; then you are
special.<span class=s4></span>They ascend from</p><p>below and go on above you, so far away. Millions of lives you will
have to work and then you will be able to reach that state – it is
almost impossible.</p><p>I cannot declare myself a messiah because there is no God.</p><p><br></p><p>I cannot declare myself a tirthankara or an avatara, because to me
truth is not obtained by arduous effort in millions of lives.</p><p><br></p><p>Truth can be attained instantly, immediately, herenow, because you
have it already. So it is not a question of achieving it; you have not
to go somewhere to find it.</p><p><br></p><p>You are carrying truth within you all the time. It is just that you
are not awake.</p><p>But awakening does not need millions of lives.</p><p><br></p><p>Just a good hit on your head and you will be awake – more than
awake.</p><p><br></p><p>So I don’t see myself superior to you. I don’t see anybody inferior
to me; I don’t see anybody superior to me either – neither Jesus, nor
Buddha, nor Mahavira. I don’t see them as superior to me, because it is
such a simple human experience. Why make so much ado about nothing?
Somehow even in Mahavira and Buddha some shadow of the ego is still
persisting. They have arrived but they are not whole. Perhaps a leg is
missing, a hand is missing; something is missing, something is left
behind.</p><p><br></p><p>Pakhtoonistan is a very small country between Pakistan and
Afghanistan, almost a part of Afghanistan. Once it was a part of India;
now legally it is part of Pakistan. But the Pakhtoons don’t want to be
part of Pakistan, they want to be part of India; and if that is not
possible they want.… Because now, Pakistan is in between. They are
Mohammedans but a different race.</p><p><br></p><p>The Pakhtoon is a really beautiful man, perhaps the tallest in the
whole world, the strongest in the whole world, and lives longest in the
whole world. You will not find a single Pakhtoon who is fat – they are
so proportionate and so tall and so beautiful, as if sculptured by
someone like Leonardo da Vinci. They don’t want to mix with Pakistan,
they would rather be together with Afghanistan.</p><p><br></p><p>These tribal people have a strange idea. I am reminded of it because
I said that it is as if Buddha has left something behind, as if Mahavira
has left something behind. Pakhtoons believe that when a man dies he
should die with his body complete. No part should be missing because God
will ask, “Where is your hand? – because when I sent you into the world
you were whole.” So they never allow any operation, any amputation. They
would rather die than have their kidneys taken out, because they are
simple people, primitive people, and their logic is simple: when God
asks, “Where are your kidneys?...”</p><p><br></p><p>A beautiful story happened. In Lahore, a Pakhtoon, in the first world
war, got shot in the hand. The situation was such that if his hand was
not cut off, then his whole body would be poisoned. The decision had to
be taken immediately, because even a few moments delay and it would be
too late. The Pakhtoon himself was unconscious, in a coma. His family
was somewhere in Pakhtoonistan and difficult to find, because
Pakhtoonistan still has no postal system, no telegraph, no telegrams, no
telephones, no roads.</p><p>Only one road passes from Pakistan to Afghanistan, and even to pass
through that road is very difficult because Pakhtoon children go on
practicing shooting – shooting drivers, shooting passengers in the
buses! They are very primitive and simple people. Where to learn? They
don’t think of making a target – and what is the point when there are so
many targets?</p><p><br></p><p>When I was traveling in Pakhtoonistan, my driver said, “I won’t allow
you to drive here.” I said, “Why? It is such a beautiful country.”</p><p>He said, “You don’t know: drivers are just targets! I won’t allow
you. You sit in the other seat, the passenger’s seat; I will have to
drive. I have driven on this road so I know where the danger is and how
to avoid it and what to do. They are continually shooting – just
children. From the very childhood all that they want is a gun.”</p><p><br></p><p>So where to find his family to get their consent to cut his hand off?
And he is a Pakhtoon: when he comes back to consciousness and finds that
his hand is missing, he is going to create trouble. But there was no
other way. The doctor, who was an Englishman, said, “I take the
responsibility. I know the man and I will convince him somehow. Cut off
his hand.”</p><p><br></p><p>When the man came back to consciousness he was really furious. The
doctor listened to his anger then explained to him that the situation
was this: “I have taken the whole responsibility, and look, I have
preserved your hand.” He had kept the hand in a big jar full of spirit.
He said, “I have preserved it, so when you die we will put your hand
with you.”</p><p><br></p><p>They are simple people; he understood the logic. He said, “That’s
right. What else could you have done? That’s perfectly good. So you keep
it, because we Pakhtoons are continually traveling.”</p><p><br></p><p>They used to travel all over India because from Pakhtoonistan they
used to bring dry fruits – the best grow in Pakhtoonistan – and woolen
clothes: blankets, sweaters. These two things they would carry from
Pakhtoonistan to India to sell.</p><p><br></p><p>Really, since Pakistan has been divided you don’t see Pakhtoons
coming into India. You don’t get that quality of dried fruits that they
used to bring. It was the most superior you could get anywhere.</p><p><br></p><p>So he said, “I am continually traveling. Now, to carry this hand
everywhere will look odd. Secondly, I may forget it. It may get dropped
somewhere. It is in a glass thing – it may be broken. You keep it, and I
will tell my family that when I die they should get the hand from
you.”</p><p><br></p><p>The doctor said, “That’s perfectly okay.”</p><p><br></p><p>But an accident happened: the hospital got burned, and with it, the
hand of the Pakhtoon. But the doctor was not very worried about it
because he was being retired and was going back to England, so far away
from Pakhtoonistan that those people could not bother him in any
possible way. Who was the doctor and where had he gone? Where were they
going to find him? And they could not go to England, they were poor
people.</p><p><br></p><p>But he was afraid that even in England, who knows? – those people are
dangerous. They may find some way... so it is better to keep a hand
ready, in case. But he forgot that he had cut off the left</p><p>hand. He got a right hand from a hospital and kept it preserved in
his bedroom so that if some time somebody came.…</p><p><br></p><p>The story is that one night somebody knocked on the door. The doctor
opened the door and the Pakhtoon was standing there, furious. The doctor
could not believe his eyes. The Pakhtoon didn’t say anything, he simply
showed him his left arm and asked, “Where is my hand?” – not verbally;
he just showed him his arm: “Give me my hand.”</p><p><br></p><p>The doctor almost had a nervous breakdown. He just got hold of the
flask and took it out. At that moment he realized the mistake, that it
was the right hand! And the Pakhtoon seeing it, kicked the flask over,
took the hand and threw it into the room. He said, “Tomorrow night I
will come again. You find my hand!”</p><p><br></p><p>Perhaps the second part of the story is psychological. For the doctor
this became a nightmare. Every night.<span class=s4></span>The doctor
gets into this insane idea that the Pakhtoon has died. Perhaps
somebody</p><p>from Lahore – a colleague, another doctor – has informed him that the
Pakhtoon has died, and to be aware. Perhaps it is only his own
imagination, but he thinks he sees the ghost of the Pakhtoon. Whatever
the case – I don’t believe in ghosts, but you can imagine.…</p><p><br></p><p>If you can imagine God, why not a ghost? – just a very small
creature. If you can see Jesus and Krishna and Buddha, then there is no
problem: you can hallucinate just a poor Pakhtoon. And there was cause
enough – the doctor had broken his word.</p><p><br></p><p>Pakhtoons are very truthful. If they give a promise they will fulfill
it whatsoever the cost. Even for a small thing they will risk their
life; if they have promised, they will do it. So he was afraid perhaps
because of that. The doctor had lived amongst Pakhtoons in Lahore and he
knew what kind of people they are: even after death.<span class=s4></span>And particularly in England, ghosts appear more
than</p><p>anywhere else.</p><p><br></p><p>England is somehow very attractive to ghosts. There are
proportionately more houses in England than in any country which are
haunted by ghosts. Britain has a certain magnetism for ghosts. Perhaps
that is why British people look so serious, afraid.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t start a conversation with Proper Sagar unless you are properly
introduced before. Perhaps there is also a fear of getting into
conversation with a ghost: you don’t know who he is. If somebody you
know introduces you, then it is okay; otherwise who knows who is who?
This doctor must have been a Proper Sagar.</p><p><br></p><p>The story is that he died because of this continual nightmare. One
morning he was found dead. He must have thought that the Pakhtoon had
pressed on his neck and throat, but actually he was pressing on his own
throat; and in the morning, when he was found, he had killed himself.
But he must have thought, hallucinated, got into the idea and killed
himself. He must have died thinking that the Pakhtoon was killing him!
But the idea of the Pakhtoon, that you should be whole when you go back,
is significant.</p><p><br></p><p>And Buddha has left something behind: he is still somehow saying to
you that he is higher. He declares that he has attained the highest
cosmic consciousness, which nobody had ever attained before.</p><p>Now, this is the same game, played more sophisticatedly. But what he
is trying to do is the same as what Jesus is trying to do in saying
that, “I am the only begotten son of God. Nobody was before, nobody is
going to be afterwards; I am the only son.” He is making his place
superior forever. Buddha is doing the same; of course he says that he is
coming from millions of lives.</p><p><br></p><p>In one life he was an elephant – but then too he was superior. He
tells the story that when he was an elephant the jungle caught fire. The
fire was spreading so fast, and the wind was so strong, that all the
animals were running out of the jungle. He was also running, but finding
a big shady tree he stood there just to rest a little in the coolness of
the shadow.</p><p><br></p><p>As he was just going to move and had lifted up one of his feet, a
small rabbit, running in just the same fear of the fire, also came under
the shadow of the tree, and rested there just where the elephant was
going to put his foot. Now, to put his foot down would kill the rabbit,
but not to put his foot... how long could he stand on three feet? And
you should understand: an elephant standing on three feet is a really
heavy job, just the one foot up is enoughl</p><p><br></p><p>But Buddha said, “I kept my foot up and saved the life of the rabbit,
although because of balancing that great a load I tumbled and fell
sideways and died. But because I had done that good deed, I was born as
a man.”</p><p><br></p><p>Now, even while he was an elephant he was a superior elephant, not an
ordinary elephant; otherwise I don’t think any elephant is going to be
bothered by a rabbit. In the first place he won’t even see if the rabbit
is there. Elephants are big but their eyes are very small. Have you seen
that strange combination? – such small eyes in such a big animal. Who is
creating these designs? A little proportion is needed. Or do you think
the elephant can see the rabbit who is just sitting underneath his feet?
I think it will take long yoga practice for the elephant to look down;
it is not easy for an elephant to look that far down.</p><p><br></p><p>Just draw a picture of an elephant – I have drawn one and I have
tried in every possible way to imagine myself as the elephant, but I
couldn’t see the rabbit. The foot is there, and the rabbit is underneath
the foot – but such small eyes in such a big body... it is just not
possible.</p><p><br></p><p>Even in his elephant life Buddha was so non-violent, non-hurting,
that he preferred his own death rather than killing a rabbit. He tells
many stories of his past lives, and in every life he is superior. That
superiority continues even into this last life: now he is the
suprememost enlightened man.</p><p><br></p><p>For you it will take millions of lives – you may not yet be at the
stage of the elephant. Would you be ready to die to save a rabbit? You
won’t be even ready to save your wife – particularly your wife, because
married life is such that people say to each other.…</p><p><br></p><p>One lover was saying to his beloved, “Without you I will die, I can’t
breathe. Without you I can’t see any meaning in life. Without seeing
you, my whole day becomes dark and dismal, but on the days I see you I
am so full of joy that I can see stars even in the daytime.”</p><p><br></p><p>Women are more practical; they don’t listen to all this garbage. She
knew that he must have learned this dialogue that he was speaking from
some film or somewhere. She said, “What about tomorrow? Are you coming
tomorrow?”</p><p>He said, “If it does not rain – because I don’t have my umbrella
repaired yet.” Poetry is one thing, but when things come to reality then
it is a totally different world.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha is trying to prove himself not only higher than YOU<span class=s4></span>He tells the story, “When I became</p><p>enlightened all three Hindu gods<span class=s4></span>” Just like
the Christian trinity, Hinduism has the trimurti, the three</p><p>faces of God – one body but three faces. It looks almost more logical
than the Christian trinity – God the Father, the Holy Ghost, and Jesus
Christ the Son.</p><p><br></p><p>This trinity looks a very incomplete family: there is no mother, no
brothers, no sisters. And the story is so old that it must have been a
joint family. In those days such a nuclear family – only one son, and
that too without a wife! Great birth control – even the wife is dropped.
It doesn’t seem that it can be real.</p><p><br></p><p>The Hindu God seems to have some logic behind it: one body, three
faces. Brahma is the creative face who creates the world; Vishnu is the
sustainer, who sustains the world; and Shiva is the destructive part,
who destroys the world. This seems to be more logical, perhaps more
scientific too.</p><p><br></p><p>It is a strange thing: science goes on dividing and dividing –
molecules have been divided into atoms and atoms themselves have been
divided – and the ultimate division science has arrived at is into
three. One is positive, that can be the creative part; the other is
neutral, that can be the sustainer part; the third is destructive,
negative, that can be the third face of the Hindu God.</p><p><br></p><p>Sooner or later Hindus are going to brag that this is what their
three faces mean – electron, neutron, proton – that this is the new way
of saying the same thing; but it is one body, it is the same
electricity, the same force. What does Buddha manage to do with this? He
says, “When I became enlightened all three Hindu gods, Brahma, Vishnu,
Mahesh – all three came to touch my feet.”</p><p><br></p><p>Now, this is even better than Jesus. Jesus after all is just a son.
Buddha manages to have all the three Hindu gods touch his feet, because
those three gods say, “The enlightened being is far higher than God. We
also desire, in some life, to gain the same state of being.”</p><p><br></p><p>In Hinduism, gods are not permanent beings. They have a certain
period of time in heaven that they have earned through being good in the
world, a certain bank balance of virtue. They will live in heaven till
that bank balance is finished. Once it is finished they are thrown back
into the world, again on the road – in the wheel of life and death. The
enlightened being does not go to heaven, he goes to moksha.</p><p><br></p><p>Moksha is above heaven, from where no fall is possible, because it
doesn’t happen through virtue or good deeds, it happens through
awareness, total awareness. And once you are totally aware, how can you
fall? So Buddha uses a far more clever strategy to prove himself
superior. Mahavira uses it in the same way. A tirthankara becomes a
tirthankara through millions of lives of arduous austerities; and there
are only twenty-four tirthankaras in one cycle of creation.</p><p><br></p><p>Only recently has Western physics become aware of such immense spans
of time, but Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism have been aware of them for
a long time. In English you cannot find the equivalent to many numbers
which are available in Indian languages. One cycle is not a small
thing</p><p>but of millions and millions of years. Creation does not begin like
Christians say – which looks very childish – four thousand and four
years before Jesus Christ.</p><p>Now, the Eastern people will laugh and say, “Whom are you kidding?
Creation happened four thousand and four years before Christ?” China has
been for at least ten thousand years. India has been, according to
Indian scholars, for at least ninety thousand years.</p><p>If you don’t believe them it is difficult to argue against their
argument because in the RIG VEDA the Hindus have a description of stars
in a certain combination which happened – according to scientific
astronomers – ninety thousand years ago. If that particular combination
of stars was known to the people who were writing the RIG VEDA, it is
enough proof that the RIG VEDA is far older than ninety thousand
years.</p><p>Even if the RIG VEDA was written later on, at least in the memory of
the people that particular combination of stars was kept in mind – and
the RIG VEDA says it happened exactly ninety thousand years ago. Their
book is ninety thousand years old; your creation is only six thousand
years old – from today. So it is very difficult to argue that it is not
so. Hindus will laugh and say, “What are you talking about?”</p><p>Jainas are even more mathematical. In the RIG VEDA, their first
tirthankara’s name is mentioned. That becomes even more complicated a
problem because their first tirthankara, Rishabadeva, is mentioned by
name with great respect.</p><p>It is very logical: to show so much respect to a person who is
against your religion makes one thing certain – he can’t be
contemporary. These are simple, logical ways to think. In the first
place, if somebody is your contemporary, you are full of contempt
towards the man – perhaps that is the meaning of contemporary – you
cannot believe in him.</p><p>That’s why they could not believe in Jesus Christ. They couldn’t
believe in him. When Buddha was contemporary, Hindus did not recognize
him. But five hundred years after he died they had to recognize him as
one of the Hindu incarnations of God because his influence had grown so
much. Now to reject him meant to reject all the Buddhists. That would
have been a great loss to the Hindu priesthood. It was better to absorb
them, to keep them under the Hindu fold so that you could go on
exploiting them; otherwise they would move apart.</p><p>So for five hundred years Hindus were continually criticizing Buddha,
but after five hundred years they changed their tactics, their strategy.
Up to that time they had only ten incarnations of God, and there was no
room to allow for Buddha, but Buddhists wouldn’t agree for any lesser
position than that. So they had to increase the quota! Five hundred
years after Buddha, the Hindus changed and started saying, “If we have
twenty-four avataras... just as Jainas have twentyfour tirthankaras and
Buddhists have twenty-four Buddhas, we also have twenty-four
avataras.”</p><p>Gautam Buddha was born in a Hindu family, obviously – just like Jesus
was born in a Jewish family – so he was a Hindu, and he died as a Hindu.
They reclaimed him and declared him one of the incarnations of the Hindu
God. But for the contemporary Buddha there was nothing but contempt.</p><p>It is so common a practice all over the world – that you can respect
a man who is dead, and the longer he is dead, the better. If he is
outside the scope of your history then you can respect him very easily,
then there is no problem at all. He is so distant from you, it does not
hurt.</p><p>But somebody sitting by your side declaring himself the only begotten
son of God! You cannot believe this guy – perspiring, stinking – is the
only begotten son of God. You feel like kicking him! The only son of
God? You feel angry at him, at God, at everything that this man.<span class=s4></span>But after two</p><p>thousand years have passed nobody is worried; nobody seems to be
concerned whether Jesus was really the son of God.</p><p><br></p><p>Christians have accepted it but Jews don’t talk about him.
Mohammedans have accepted him because they have no problem about him.
Hindus, Jainas, Buddhists, have no trouble with Jesus. You cannot
convert a single Jaina to Christianity, or a single Buddhist to
Christianity, because Christianity is a far more primitive religion.
Those people are far superior in their arguments and their logic.</p><p><br></p><p>Many Christians have become Buddhists; not a single Buddhist becomes
Christian. There is nothing in it to appeal to them. Do you think a
Bud&amp;ist will be impressed by the fact that Jesus is the son of the
virgin, Mary? He will simply laugh; he will say, “You are joking!” What
has Christianity got?</p><p><br></p><p>One Christian missionary went, with his BIBLE, to see a Zen Master.
He started reading the Sermon on the Mount, of course; that is the best
part. In fact that’s all that Christianity is about. He had read only
one or two sentences when the Zen monk said, “Stop. Whoever the guy was,
he was a bodhisattva” – bodhisattva means in some future life he will
become a buddha. “Be finished! These sentences are proof enough that in
some future life this guy is going to become a buddha. But don’t be
bothered with him, he is not a buddha right now – only a
bodhisattva.”</p><p><br></p><p>Bodhisattva means essentially a buddha, but everybody is a
bodhisattva essentially. You may take lives to make your essence actual;
that depends on you, but you are a buddha. Not only you, the trees, the
birds, even the dogs are essentially bodhisattvas. They may take a
little longer, or maybe some intelligent dog rushes ahead and leaves you
behind. It is happening: all intelligent dogs have come to Oregon. They
have made a party – 1000 Friends of Oregon. They are known as
watchdogs!</p><p><br></p><p>I was wondering why they are called watchdogs. Finally the revelation
came to me that they are dogs, but very intelligent. Most of them are in
the legal profession; they have changed themselves into watchdogs. Even
dogs, even watchdogs of Oregon are bodhisattvas. So that Zen Master was
not saying much, but that missionary was overjoyed. And the story was
being told all over, in Christian churches that a Zen Master had
accepted Jesus; but the missionary did not understand the meaning of
bodhisattva.</p><p><br></p><p>Bodhisattva does not mean buddha. Sattva means essence, potentially;
but potentiality may always remain a potentiality – there is no
necessity for a seed to become a tree. A seed may remain just a seed
forever – there are different types of seed. Some seed may choose to sit
upon a rock. You can go on meditating sitting on a rock, but you are not
going to become a buddha. On a rock a seed will remain a seed.</p><p><br></p><p>To become a tree the seed has to die into the earth, dissolve itself
completely; on its death is the birth of the tree. Its death is
absolutely essential. Here it dies, and on the other side the tree is
born, a small sprout, but alive. The seed was almost dead. I say
“almost” because it had the potential of life. But a seed can remain a
seed – and millions of seeds do remain seeds.</p><p>So it was nothing much; that Zen Master really joked with the
missionary. He said, “Stop, enough! Those two lines are enough.
Whosoever said it.<span class=s4></span>” He did not even bother to
ask who had said it.</p><p>He said, “Whosoever has said it, he is a bodhisattva. Close the book
– now talk business.” I am not the first Rajneeshee or the last
Rajneeshee.</p><p>I am not a Rajneeshee at all. I am just an outsider.</p><p>You may be Rajneeshees, but don’t drag me into your Big Muddy Ranch.
You enjoy the Big Muddy Ranch – leave me outside.</p><p><br></p><p>I am just a guest, because in the first place I don’t want to be
crucified – no interest in it at all. I don’t want to be deified – no
interest in it at all.</p><p><br></p><p>Whatever I am is so fulfilling that I don’t see any need to be
something else. I don’t see anybody superior to me, I don’t see anybody
inferior to me.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact both those things exist together. Anybody who thinks somebody
is superior must think somebody else inferior, and vice versa: if you
think somebody is inferior to you, you are bound to think of somebody as
superior. It is the same mind; and those two dimensions are not two
dimensions but two polarities of the same thing.</p><p><br></p><p>I am simply out of it. I am just not playing that game of being
superior and inferior.</p><p><br></p><p>If you are really interested in what I am doing and saying and being,
then never let “Rajneeshee” become something like Christian, Hindu,
Mohammedan, no. Never get serious about it. It is just a word to
demarcate.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not a creed, a cult, a dogma that you have to fight for, that
you have to go on a crusade for. No, – you need not become Don Quixotes
– you are not to convert anybody.</p><p><br></p><p>Rajneeshee is simply a name.</p><p><br></p><p>Some name is needed, X, Y, Z, anything will do, just to give you a
demarcation. You are not Hindus, you are not Mohammedans, you are not
Christians. People are going to ask, “Then who are you?”</p><p><br></p><p>I have never voted. My name is not even on the census reports in
India because whenever the census people came there was a clause which
had to be filled out: To which religion do you belong? I said, “This is
difficult – I don’t belong to any religion.” But they insisted the form
had to be filled out completely, only then was it acceptable. I said,
“Forget about it. Don’t accept it – I don’t care about it. Your form is
your business. Just get lostl I am not going to fill in that clause
because that would be a lie: I don’t belong to any religion.”</p><p><br></p><p>But those poor people insisted, You must belong to something. If you
are an atheist you can say, ‘I am an atheist.’”</p><p>But I am not an atheist. I am not obsessed with the idea that there
is no God, and I am not after Him. If there is no God why should I be
after Him? And why should I call myself an atheist when there is no
God?</p><p><br></p><p>Theism is belief in God. Atheism is disbelief in God. My God! –
disbelief in God?</p><p>I told these people, “I don’t believe, I don’t disbelieve: I simply
have nothing to do with God.” They said then, “But you must be doing
some prayer.”</p><p>I said, “Never. I have never done any prayer. Why should I do any
prayer?” And they were almost angry at this. Once it happened that they
had come to my house and went away very angry. Then they came to the
university, but they did not recognize me because in the house I had
been simply sitting with a lungi on, my body half-naked, and in the
college I had on a robe. So they could not figure out that I was the
same person: again they brought out the form.</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Listen, if you show me this form again I am going to hit you
really hard.” They said, “Again? but we have never met.”</p><p>I said, “You have forgotten. That guy who was<span class=s4></span>” Then they looked again and they said, “Yes,
that’s</p><p>true. Now we will be continually aware of beards. We may come across
you again somewhere.”</p><p><br></p><p>I was at that time really strong – one hundred and ninety pounds –
and I was running eight miles every day, morning and evening, whenever I
could find time. So that when I said to anybody, “I will hit you hard,”
they understood it would be hard.</p><p><br></p><p>I had enjoyed jumping, running, swimming so much that my family was
always worried: “Will you do anything else in life or not? And you
create such a nuisance for other people.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “But I simply do my thing. I don’t get in anybody’s way.” But
they had something at hand – some report had arrived. So they said,
“This is not true. This morning at four o’clock, what business did you
have that you were running backwards? We know there are people who go
running, but BACKWARDS?”</p><p><br></p><p>The place where I lived was in the most beautiful area – with big,
tall trees and a long row of bamboos, so it was always shadowy near the
bamboos. It was a full moon night, and I was just doing my exercises by
the side of those bamboos. It is more joyous to run backwards because
you are moving into the unknown; you can’t see what might happen. And at
four o’clock the street was almost empty. But there is an Indian belief
that ghosts walk backwards.…</p><p><br></p><p>There was a man who used to live at the corner of the road who had a
small tea shop. He used to get very afraid, but only in the beginning.
Then I went to him and told him, “You need not be afraid:</p><p>I am a man, I am not a ghost, and every morning you see me; so once
and for all be settled about it and go on sleeping – don’t get
disturbed.”</p><p><br></p><p>But what happened that day was that the milk man.<span class=s4></span>They come early in the morning because they</p><p>bring milk from nearby villages with two big drums full of milk on a
bicycle. The milkman was coming along the road when suddenly he saw me.
He lost his balance and fell from the bicycle. Because the drums fell
and made so much noise, I turned back wondering, What is the matter? I
saw the bicycle, the drums and the milk all over the road. And the man
running far away!</p><p><br></p><p>I simply forgot that it was not good to follow him. I just wanted to
help him and tell him that I was not a ghost, so I followed him. And
because I was always running he could not escape me. When he saw me
coming behind him, he simply fell down, unconscious. And I was trying to
tell him.…</p><p><br></p><p>By that time the man who lived at the corner came and said, “Look,
this is what used to happen to me. And if he fell from his bicycle, what
business was it of yours to follow him?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I was simply trying to help – so that he was sure that I am
a man.” He said, “Now have you made sure? Now he has almost become a
ghost!”</p><p>That report had reached my family and that was why they were saying:
“This is not right. You should not get in people’s way.”</p><p><br></p><p>Those census officers said, “Sir” – because there they were
respectful to a university professor. At my house I was in the garden,
digging a hole. There they were very angry with me, thinking me a
gardener or somebody who was just talking absurdities in saying that he
could not fill in this line. In the university they said, “Sir, one
thing please remember: if we come across you again, you remind us and we
will simply leave. We will not say anything.”</p><p><br></p><p>So my name does not exist on the Indian voters’ list. I have not
voted in my whole life because my name never appeared on the voters’
list. It was not in the census list even, for the simple reason that I
could not say what my religion was.</p><p><br></p><p>You are fortunate, you can say what your religion is. But it is not
to be taken seriously. You are not to fight for it.</p><p>You are not to die for it.</p><p><br></p><p>You have to live it, enjoy it, relish it. And please, leave me out of
it!</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part9>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

WHAT IS EXISTENCE? IS IT SOMETHING LIKE WHAT PEOPLE CALL GOD?

IS IT SOMETHING LIKE WHAT PEOPLE CALL GOD?\nSampurna, existence is that which is, and God is that which is not. Existence is a reality, God is a fiction. Existence is available only to meditators, people of silence; God is a consolation for sick minds, sick psychologies.\nExistence is not your production – God is. That’s why there is only one existence, but thousands of gods. Each according to his needs, each according to his suffering, each according to his expectations, creates a god or accepts an old belief about God.\nGod is a great consolation, but it is not a cure. Existence is not a consolation. To be in tune with it is to be healthy and whole. All the religions of the world have been teaching God; I teach you existence. I teach you to be in tune with that which surrounds you, which is within you and without you. Once you are in tune with it, there is no death for you, no misery, no tension, no worry, but a tremendous peace surrounds you, a contentment which you have never even dreamt of.\nGod is for those who cannot grow in consciousness, who are retarded as far as consciousness is concerned. It is a kind of toy; retarded people need it. And the moment I say it is a toy, then it is up to you how you want to make it – looking like a monkey or looking like an elephant. It is just up to you\nwhether to give him four hands or one thousand hands. It is your creation. Strangely enough, man believes God created everything. The truth is that God himself is a creation of man’s imagination.\nGod is the greatest lie you can ever find, because on that lie thousands of other lies depend. Churches, religious organizations go on multiplying lies upon lies, just to protect one lie.\nYou have to understand the psychology of lying. The first thing about lying is that you need a good memory because you have to remember. You lie to someone about something, to somebody else about something else; you have to remember what you have said to one and what you have said to the other.\nTruth needs no remembrance. Truth is always there, just the same. You don’t have to cram it in your memory. Memory gives you a bondage, a prison; it clings around you, covers you so much, slowly slowly, that you disappear completely. Truth is uncovering yourself from all lies. And there is a sudden revelation that you are part of the immense truth I am calling existence.\nYou don’t need any churches, you don’t need any temples, you don’t need any mosques; you need only a prayerful heart, a loving heart, a grateful heart. That is your real temple. That will transform your whole life. That will help you to discover not only yourself, but the very depths of this immense existence.\nWe are almost like the waves of the ocean – just on the surface, and the ocean may be miles deep. The Pacific Ocean is five miles deep. But a small wave on the top will never know the depth – her own depth, because she is not separate from the ocean. She will cling to her small entity, be afraid about death, be afraid of losing herself in the vastness, the oceanic infinity. But the truth is, the death of the wave is not a death, but the beginning of an eternal life.\nGod has been invented. It was people’s need; people needed a protector. In the immensity of the universe, a man feels so alone, so small. The vastness creates trembling in him. What is your existence?\nI am reminded of a story by Bertrand Russell. The archbishop of England sees in a dream that he has reached the pearly gates of paradise. On one hand he is immensely pleased, and on the other hand he is very much troubled, because the pearly gates are so vast, in both directions, that he cannot see the whole gate. It is so high that it is beyond the capacity of his eyes to see. And he himself seems to be just like a small ant, compared to this great gate. He is a little bit afraid. He is no ordinary man, he is the archbishop of England. He feels humiliated just by the gate, and the fear arises, “If this is the situation at the gate, what is the situation going to be inside?”\nWith fearful hands he knocks on the door, but in the immensity of that space only he can hear his knock. It takes days for him, but he goes on knocking harder and harder. Finally a small window opens in the gate and Saint Peter looks out with one thousand eyes, trying to figure out who has been making a noise. Those one thousand eyes are so shiny, like stars, that the archbishop feels even more reduced – almost to a nonentity.\nAnd Saint Peter asks, “Please, whoever you are, wherever you are, come in front of me.”\nThe archbishop declares himself. He says to Saint Peter, “Perhaps you don’t know me. You can check with Jesus Christ, I am the archbishop of England.” Saint Peter says, “Never heard of any such thing as England.”\nThe archbishop says, “Perhaps you may not have heard about England, but you must have heard about our beautiful planet, Earth.”\nSaint Peter says, “I don’t want to hurt your feelings, but unless you give me the index number of your Earth, I cannot figure out what you are talking about. I will have to go to the library and look – if you give me the index number – to which solar system you belong, because there are millions of solar systems and each solar system has many planets.”\nBut the archbishop has never thought that the earth has any index number. He says, “I don’t know any index number, but I am the archbishop. You just go and tell Jesus Christ.”\nHe says, “You are giving me puzzle after puzzle. Who is this fellow Jesus Christ?”\nThe archbishop is very much shocked. He says, “You don’t know Jesus Christ, the only begotten son of God?”\nSaint Peter says, “As far as I am concerned, I have never seen God; I don’t know whether he exists or not. I am just a doorkeeper. Perhaps somewhere in the most interior parts of paradise somebody exists who thinks that he is God, but I have never come across...”\nIt is such a shock that the archbishop wakes up perspiring.\nThe story is significant because it shows how small we are and how big the universe is. Naturally primitive man was not able to adjust himself to the idea of this vastness of the universe without giving it some personality and without making himself in some way related to that personality.\nGod was an effort of the primitive mind of man to give existence a personality. Then he becomes God the father. Then you can make some relationship with him. You may even be against him, but at least there is someone you can be for, you can be against; there is someone who is greater than you, who is going to protect you, who is your guarantee. God is simply the poverty of human consciousness.\nThe people who attained to their inner consciousness and its highest peak, like Gautam Buddha, denied the existence of God. Anybody who has ever become inwardly healthy, gone beyond the mind which is basically sick, has denied God. God as a fiction is good for kindergarten school children. They need it – parables, fables, stories. But very few human beings have gone beyond the kindergarten school.\nGod exists because you are not aware of yourself. God exists because you have not made any contact with your own center. The moment you know yourself, there is no God and there is no need of any God. In fact I am in absolute support of Friedrich Nietzsche: “God is dead.”\nThe second part of his sentence is even more significant, “God is dead and man is now free.” That second part has not received much attention from the philosophers, from the mystics, from the\npsychologists, but the second part is the most important; the first part is not much. In fact, the first part is basically wrong. God cannot die – fictions never die. The moment you know they are fictions there is no question of their death. Neither are they born, nor do they die. God was never born in the first place – how can he die? Death is the other extreme of birth.\nSo the first part is not very important, but that has been given much importance by theologians, because they became afraid: “This is sacrilegious, to tell people that God is dead. That means that now no religion is needed.” They became afraid for their own business. But they forgot the second part which is more important. It has tremendously significant implications. It means that God was a bondage, God was a retardedness, God was out of fear. God was not a treasure, but a heavy, mountainous weight on your heart and on your growth.\nOnce God is removed, man’s possibility to grow and blossom is absolutely free. A God is a despot, a fascist. Without God, the world becomes freedom. Existence gives a tremendous dignity to every individual. From the smallest blade of grass up to the greatest star in the universe it gives immense significance and love; it makes no difference. There is equality and equal opportunity. And there is no need unnecessarily to pray and waste your time, to read the holy scriptures, which are the most unholy books in the world. There is no need to be exploited by the priests. You are certainly and suddenly free from all these chains. Now you can be yourself.\nWhile God is in existence you can never be yourself. You are just a puppet, your strings are in the hands of God. The ancient saying in India is that not even a small leaf of a tree moves unless God’s order is received for it to move. Whatever you are, according to religions you are made out of mud. The word ‘human’ comes from humus, which means mud. And the word in Hebrew, Arabic, Urdu, Hindi, is admi – it is used as the name of the first man, Adam. Admi means the earth. God made man out of the earth and then breathed life into the puppet.\nNow, what kind of freedom do you have? Somebody has breathed life into you, and it is in his hands to stop breathing life into you any moment. Whatever you are doing, the religions believe it is your fate, it is written on your forehead. And there have been many con men who have even been trying to read what is written on your forehead. Astrologers, palmists, all kinds of cunning people have been exploiting the simplicity and innocence of humanity. There are people who are reading your hand, looking at the lines, telling you what those lines mean. The whole emphasis is that you are not living a life of your own, you are just a part in a drama, and the part that you are playing has been decided beforehand.\nThat was the argument that the Indian God’s incarnation, Krishna – in the great Indian war, Mahabharata – gave to his disciple Arjuna. Seeing the immense massacre that was going to happen, Arjuna simply lost his nerve. He was a man of immense courage and great intelligence.\nHe said, “I don’t see any point in this war. Even if I win... and I am certain I am going to win” – there was no other warrior of his quality – “But sitting on the golden throne of victory surrounded by the corpses of all my friends and all my enemies, all the beautiful people, does not appeal to me at all. The scene makes me feel insane. Rather than fighting, I will leave it to the other party – who is nobody, another cousin-brother. Let him rule over the country and I will go to the mountains, to the Himalayas to meditate, to become a sannyasin. I have lost all interest in fighting.”\nKrishna tries in every way to persuade him, but Arjuna is a great intellectual; he goes on arguing against him. Finally seeing no other way, Krishna takes the last resort and says, “It is written in your destiny. Going away, you are going away from God. This war is predetermined by God to destroy those who are not virtuous and only let those survive who are virtuous.” Now there is no argument against it, because Arjuna himself believes in God and destiny.\nArjuna fought the war. Krishna was responsible, five thousand years ago, for destroying this country by giving a false argument, absolutely fictitious, to Arjuna. That war killed so many people. And it is not only that it killed people, it also destroyed the courage of the country; it became afraid of any small calamity.\nTwo thousand years of slavery.… I want to make it absolutely clear that the people who are responsible for these two thousand years of slavery are the greatest people of India. The list is headed by Krishna; Arjuna is just his shadow. Then came Mahavira, who taught people to be nonviolent to such an extreme that his followers cannot even cultivate, because plants have life; if you cultivate then you will have to kill the plants when you reap the crop. Gautam Buddha comes third, who taught people to accept, to be contented wherever and with whatever they have – poor, hungry, starving, enslaved, remain utterly contented.\nTheir teachings were great. This is something to be remembered; otherwise I will be misunderstood by everyone. Their teachings were great, but they never thought about all the implications of their teachings. They never thought that if you teach a country nonviolence, if you teach a country to drop all weapons, when the whole world is not doing that, then you are putting that country in a state of being victimized, exploited by anyone.\nAnd for two thousand years invader after invader came to India, exploited it and went back. Finally Mohammedans came and they thought, “What is the need to go back? We can not only exploit people, but rule them and remain here.” And then came the Britishers and the French and the Portuguese, and they all tried to exploit the country. They all had their small pockets. Britain proved to be far more clever. But the Portuguese had their small islands of Diu, Daman and Goa, and the French had a small portion of the country, Pondicherry. Britain had the whole country.\nPeople have remained starved and hungry, and people have gone on dying because of hunger, and nobody has ever thought that these great principles in some way are responsible for this unfortunate situation that for thousands of years India has had to pass through. And even today nobody is trying to see all the implications. Every great principle has its own black cloud behind it. And unless you understand the black cloud also, you are soon going to be absorbed by the black cloud. If you understand it, you can avoid it.\nGod seems to be the greatest principle that has been preached to man down the ages, but nobody has looked at its implications. If God created man then man has no individuality of his own, then he cannot claim any dignity, any freedom. There is no question of a puppet declaring, “I want to be free.” If God created the universe, then whatever has happened in the universe has had to happen. It was God’s will. No effort on our part was going to change anything.\nAnd finally you can see, if God created the world, and if he is behind nuclear weapons and the people who are creating them, then no effort on man’s part can prevent the destruction of the whole\nplanet. To give the creation of the world into the hands of a fictitious God is very dangerous. It makes us absolutely impotent. We cannot do anything.\nHence, my simple understanding of consciousness is that if God did not die with Friedrich Nietzsche’s declaration, then we have to kill him! Wherever you meet him, there is no need even to say hello. First kill him and then you can say hello – just to fulfill the formality. But God is not needed at all. With God above in the sky, man will always remain a slave, and man will always remain unconscious, and man will never strive to reach to the peaks of his potential. With God removed you may feel a little fear – just out of old habit – but that fear will disappear.\nOnce you recognize that you are standing on your own feet and you have to do something to create a better consciousness in you, to create a more loving heart in you, that prayers are useless, there is nobody to answer them... Yes, sometimes they have been answered. At least once, certainly.…\nA poor man asked God for months continually, “Give me fifty dollars. I don’t want much, just fifty dollars.”\nFirst he prayed, but then he thought, “Millions of people are praying, and there is one God and there are millions of prayers. Whether my poor prayer ever reaches to him... And there must be around him so much noise – prayers from all the churches, all the mosques, all the synagogues, all the temples – who is going to take care of me? It is better that I write a letter.”\nHe wrote a letter saying, “This is to remind you that for months I have been praying, but the answer has not come. It seems my prayer has not reached you. I can understand, because of the noise around you of so many prayers. And great people are praying – the pope and the archbishop and the shankaracharya – so who is going to take care of my small prayer? And I am not asking much – no paradise, no heaven, nothing, just fifty dollars. Finally I decided to write the letter.” And he wrote in big letters, “FIFTY DOLLARS! Remember, it is urgent.”\nBut then he was very much disturbed, because he didn’t know the address, whom to address it to. He thought, “The best way is to address it to: God, c/o The Postmaster General. If the postmaster general cannot find his address, who else can?” The letter reached the postmaster general. He looked, he laughed, and then he felt sad also. He thought, “The man must be in desperate need – nobody writes letters to God. And he is not asking much.”\nSo he said to all his friends, “Please look at this poor man’s letter. You all contribute, and we will send those fifty dollars to him. At least for once let a prayer be answered.” They collected the money, but they collected only forty-five dollars. The postmaster general said, “No harm, at least we should send this much.”\nWhen forty-five dollars reached the man he counted the dollars, and he looked above and shouted, “God, remember one thing. Next time you send any money to me, never send it through the post office! Those cunning fellows have taken out their commission. I have received only forty-five dollars!”\nExcept this, I have not come across any prayer which has been answered – and that too not fully. There is no one to answer. Existence has to be approached in a different way.\nGod has to be worshipped. Existence has to be loved. God has to be prayed to.\nExistence has to be contacted in meditation.\nThere are only two kinds of religions in the world: the religions of prayer and the religions of meditation. You can see my point. The religions of prayer all believe in God and the religions of meditation don’t believe in any god. Because meditation takes you inwards, and fulfills you, there is no need to pray, there is no need for any consolation. You are in such a rejoicing, in such a blissful state; you can bless the whole world.\nI teach you existence, and the entry into existence is through your own being; hence meditation is not prayer – remember, it is against prayer. Prayer is part of that phony jargon about God, heaven, hell. Prayer is part and parcel of that whole rubbish. Meditation is simply the only pure way of coming in contact with existence. And this contact immediately becomes a merger and a melting. You become existence yourself. Then you are in the clouds and you are in the stars and you are in the flowers and you are in the rains. You are everywhere. You are no longer a drop, you have become the ocean.\nSampurna, remember the clear-cut distinction between existence and God. God is a condemnation of our intelligence. It is accepting humiliation, it is accepting that, “We are only puppets; you are the power. Whatever you want to do with us you will do. All that we can do is to pray.” It makes you so crippled. The very idea of God is nauseating. But existence has a freshness and a beauty and a truth.\nNever get mixed up with these two words. One is reality, one is simply fiction. Question 2\nBELOVED MASTER,\nWE HAVE HEARD YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT JAZZ MUSIC.\nBELOVED MASTER, THIS QUESTION COMES FROM TWO JAZZ MUSICIANS: IS OUR LOVE OF JAZZ MUSIC AN OBSTACLE ON THE PATH TO ENLIGHTENMENT?\nSatyam and Dhyanesh, my comments about jazz music were made in a totally different context. Compared to classical music, jazz music is in the lowest category, because rather than creating a spirituality in you it simply activates your sexuality. The great classical music takes you higher, beyond your mind, to silences which can give you a taste of meditation, a taste of existence.\nBut always remember that a certain reference in a certain context does not mean my whole approach to a thing. You are saying, “This question comes from two jazz musicians. Is our love of jazz music an obstacle on the path to enlightenment?” It depends on you. You can make your jazz music free\nfrom the lower gravitation of sexuality. You can make it connected with your higher centers of being, and then it will not be an obstacle on the path to enlightenment.\nIn fact, as far as my people are concerned, they are going to enter enlightenment with jazz music! It has never been tried; hence it is a great challenge and must be tried.\nNothing is wrong in the world if it is used in the right direction – with awareness, with clarity. You can purify anything, just as you can make anything impure. It is wholly a question of your clear understanding. If your meditation goes on growing side by side with your music, soon you will find that even jazz music starts having some quality of meditativeness. And if the distinction between music and meditation drops, then whatever classical music was able to do, you can also do it. And you can do it more rejoicingly, more dancingly, with a greater celebration.\nSo I don’t say that there is any obstacle, but meditation must become part of your music; otherwise just your music cannot help you to go beyond the lower instincts, biological drives. It will keep you closer to the earth, but far away from the stars.\nPope the Polack and Ronald Reagan meet in the middle of the Sahara desert. The pope is carrying a telephone booth, while Ronald Reagan has a car engine strapped to his back.\n“What are you doing with that telephone booth?” asks Reagan.\n“You see,” says Pope the Polack, “if a lion comes along, I put it down, go inside and lock the door. But why are you carrying a car engine with you?”\n“Well,” replies Reagan, “for just the same reason. When a lion comes I drop the engine and then I can run faster.”\nHymie Goldberg is trying to hold a small mirror in his hand while he adjusts his tie. The mirror slips and shatters on the ground.\n“Oh, no!” he complains to Becky. “Now I am going to have seven years’ bad luck.”\n“Nonsense,” replies Becky. “My uncle Sollie once broke a mirror, and he didn’t have seven years’ bad luck.”\n“Really?” says Hymie, encouraged.\n“Really,” repeats Becky. “He died the same day.” It all depends how you understand things.…\nMiss Goodbody, the teacher, is too shy to conduct the sex education class in school, so she asks her class to make this a homework project.\nLittle Ernie asks his father, who tells him some story about a stork. Grandma says that she was found under a gooseberry bush. Great-grandma blushes deep red and whispers that children come from God.\nThe next day, little Ernie gets called to report on his homework.\n“Well,” says Ernie, “I am afraid my family has been a little abnormal. Apparently there has been no sex at all for three generations.”\nPaddy Murphy is on his way home, when he comes across a woman crying hysterically. “What is the matter, lady?” he asks.\n“MacTavish is dead!” she sobs. “MacTavish is dead!”\nA few minutes later he comes across another woman sobbing, “MacTavish is dead! MacTavish is dead!”\nSoon he finds another woman crying the same thing, and then as he approaches the railway crossing he sees a ghastly sight.\nA train has run over a man and cut him in pieces.

IS IT SOMETHING LIKE WHAT PEOPLE CALL GOD?</p><p><br></p><p>Sampurna, existence is that which is, and God is that which is not.
Existence is a reality, God is a fiction. Existence is available only to
meditators, people of silence; God is a consolation for sick minds, sick
psychologies.</p><p><br></p><p>Existence is not your production – God is. That’s why there is only
one existence, but thousands of gods. Each according to his needs, each
according to his suffering, each according to his expectations, creates
a god or accepts an old belief about God.</p><p><br></p><p>God is a great consolation, but it is not a cure. Existence is not a
consolation. To be in tune with it is to be healthy and whole. All the
religions of the world have been teaching God; I teach you existence. I
teach you to be in tune with that which surrounds you, which is within
you and without you. Once you are in tune with it, there is no death for
you, no misery, no tension, no worry, but a tremendous peace surrounds
you, a contentment which you have never even dreamt of.</p><p><br></p><p>God is for those who cannot grow in consciousness, who are retarded
as far as consciousness is concerned. It is a kind of toy; retarded
people need it. And the moment I say it is a toy, then it is up to you
how you want to make it – looking like a monkey or looking like an
elephant. It is just up to you</p><p>whether to give him four hands or one thousand hands. It is your
creation. Strangely enough, man believes God created everything. The
truth is that God himself is a creation of man’s imagination.</p><p><br></p><p>God is the greatest lie you can ever find, because on that lie
thousands of other lies depend. Churches, religious organizations go on
multiplying lies upon lies, just to protect one lie.</p><p><br></p><p>You have to understand the psychology of lying. The first thing about
lying is that you need a good memory because you have to remember. You
lie to someone about something, to somebody else about something else;
you have to remember what you have said to one and what you have said to
the other.</p><p><br></p><p>Truth needs no remembrance. Truth is always there, just the same. You
don’t have to cram it in your memory. Memory gives you a bondage, a
prison; it clings around you, covers you so much, slowly slowly, that
you disappear completely. Truth is uncovering yourself from all lies.
And there is a sudden revelation that you are part of the immense truth
I am calling existence.</p><p><br></p><p>You don’t need any churches, you don’t need any temples, you don’t
need any mosques; you need only a prayerful heart, a loving heart, a
grateful heart. That is your real temple. That will transform your whole
life. That will help you to discover not only yourself, but the very
depths of this immense existence.</p><p><br></p><p>We are almost like the waves of the ocean – just on the surface, and
the ocean may be miles deep. The Pacific Ocean is five miles deep. But a
small wave on the top will never know the depth – her own depth, because
she is not separate from the ocean. She will cling to her small entity,
be afraid about death, be afraid of losing herself in the vastness, the
oceanic infinity. But the truth is, the death of the wave is not a
death, but the beginning of an eternal life.</p><p><br></p><p>God has been invented. It was people’s need; people needed a
protector. In the immensity of the universe, a man feels so alone, so
small. The vastness creates trembling in him. What is your
existence?</p><p><br></p><p>I am reminded of a story by Bertrand Russell. The archbishop of
England sees in a dream that he has reached the pearly gates of
paradise. On one hand he is immensely pleased, and on the other hand he
is very much troubled, because the pearly gates are so vast, in both
directions, that he cannot see the whole gate. It is so high that it is
beyond the capacity of his eyes to see. And he himself seems to be just
like a small ant, compared to this great gate. He is a little bit
afraid. He is no ordinary man, he is the archbishop of England. He feels
humiliated just by the gate, and the fear arises, “If this is the
situation at the gate, what is the situation going to be inside?”</p><p><br></p><p>With fearful hands he knocks on the door, but in the immensity of
that space only he can hear his knock. It takes days for him, but he
goes on knocking harder and harder. Finally a small window opens in the
gate and Saint Peter looks out with one thousand eyes, trying to figure
out who has been making a noise. Those one thousand eyes are so shiny,
like stars, that the archbishop feels even more reduced – almost to a
nonentity.</p><p><br></p><p>And Saint Peter asks, “Please, whoever you are, wherever you are,
come in front of me.”</p><p>The archbishop declares himself. He says to Saint Peter, “Perhaps you
don’t know me. You can check with Jesus Christ, I am the archbishop of
England.” Saint Peter says, “Never heard of any such thing as
England.”</p><p><br></p><p>The archbishop says, “Perhaps you may not have heard about England,
but you must have heard about our beautiful planet, Earth.”</p><p><br></p><p>Saint Peter says, “I don’t want to hurt your feelings, but unless you
give me the index number of your Earth, I cannot figure out what you are
talking about. I will have to go to the library and look – if you give
me the index number – to which solar system you belong, because there
are millions of solar systems and each solar system has many
planets.”</p><p><br></p><p>But the archbishop has never thought that the earth has any index
number. He says, “I don’t know any index number, but I am the
archbishop. You just go and tell Jesus Christ.”</p><p><br></p><p>He says, “You are giving me puzzle after puzzle. Who is this fellow
Jesus Christ?”</p><p><br></p><p>The archbishop is very much shocked. He says, “You don’t know Jesus
Christ, the only begotten son of God?”</p><p><br></p><p>Saint Peter says, “As far as I am concerned, I have never seen God; I
don’t know whether he exists or not. I am just a doorkeeper. Perhaps
somewhere in the most interior parts of paradise somebody exists who
thinks that he is God, but I have never come across...”</p><p><br></p><p>It is such a shock that the archbishop wakes up perspiring.</p><p><br></p><p>The story is significant because it shows how small we are and how
big the universe is. Naturally primitive man was not able to adjust
himself to the idea of this vastness of the universe without giving it
some personality and without making himself in some way related to that
personality.</p><p><br></p><p>God was an effort of the primitive mind of man to give existence a
personality. Then he becomes God the father. Then you can make some
relationship with him. You may even be against him, but at least there
is someone you can be for, you can be against; there is someone who is
greater than you, who is going to protect you, who is your guarantee.
God is simply the poverty of human consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>The people who attained to their inner consciousness and its highest
peak, like Gautam Buddha, denied the existence of God. Anybody who has
ever become inwardly healthy, gone beyond the mind which is basically
sick, has denied God. God as a fiction is good for kindergarten school
children. They need it – parables, fables, stories. But very few human
beings have gone beyond the kindergarten school.</p><p><br></p><p>God exists because you are not aware of yourself. God exists because
you have not made any contact with your own center. The moment you know
yourself, there is no God and there is no need of any God. In fact I am
in absolute support of Friedrich Nietzsche: “God is dead.”</p><p><br></p><p>The second part of his sentence is even more significant, “God is
dead and man is now free.” That second part has not received much
attention from the philosophers, from the mystics, from the</p><p>psychologists, but the second part is the most important; the first
part is not much. In fact, the first part is basically wrong. God cannot
die – fictions never die. The moment you know they are fictions there is
no question of their death. Neither are they born, nor do they die. God
was never born in the first place – how can he die? Death is the other
extreme of birth.</p><p><br></p><p>So the first part is not very important, but that has been given much
importance by theologians, because they became afraid: “This is
sacrilegious, to tell people that God is dead. That means that now no
religion is needed.” They became afraid for their own business. But they
forgot the second part which is more important. It has tremendously
significant implications. It means that God was a bondage, God was a
retardedness, God was out of fear. God was not a treasure, but a heavy,
mountainous weight on your heart and on your growth.</p><p><br></p><p>Once God is removed, man’s possibility to grow and blossom is
absolutely free. A God is a despot, a fascist. Without God, the world
becomes freedom. Existence gives a tremendous dignity to every
individual. From the smallest blade of grass up to the greatest star in
the universe it gives immense significance and love; it makes no
difference. There is equality and equal opportunity. And there is no
need unnecessarily to pray and waste your time, to read the holy
scriptures, which are the most unholy books in the world. There is no
need to be exploited by the priests. You are certainly and suddenly free
from all these chains. Now you can be yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>While God is in existence you can never be yourself. You are just a
puppet, your strings are in the hands of God. The ancient saying in
India is that not even a small leaf of a tree moves unless God’s order
is received for it to move. Whatever you are, according to religions you
are made out of mud. The word ‘human’ comes from humus, which means mud.
And the word in Hebrew, Arabic, Urdu, Hindi, is admi – it is used as the
name of the first man, Adam. Admi means the earth. God made man out of
the earth and then breathed life into the puppet.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, what kind of freedom do you have? Somebody has breathed life
into you, and it is in his hands to stop breathing life into you any
moment. Whatever you are doing, the religions believe it is your fate,
it is written on your forehead. And there have been many con men who
have even been trying to read what is written on your forehead.
Astrologers, palmists, all kinds of cunning people have been exploiting
the simplicity and innocence of humanity. There are people who are
reading your hand, looking at the lines, telling you what those lines
mean. The whole emphasis is that you are not living a life of your own,
you are just a part in a drama, and the part that you are playing has
been decided beforehand.</p><p><br></p><p>That was the argument that the Indian God’s incarnation, Krishna – in
the great Indian war, Mahabharata – gave to his disciple Arjuna. Seeing
the immense massacre that was going to happen, Arjuna simply lost his
nerve. He was a man of immense courage and great intelligence.</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I don’t see any point in this war. Even if I win... and I
am certain I am going to win” – there was no other warrior of his
quality – “But sitting on the golden throne of victory surrounded by the
corpses of all my friends and all my enemies, all the beautiful people,
does not appeal to me at all. The scene makes me feel insane. Rather
than fighting, I will leave it to the other party – who is nobody,
another cousin-brother. Let him rule over the country and I will go to
the mountains, to the Himalayas to meditate, to become a sannyasin. I
have lost all interest in fighting.”</p><p>Krishna tries in every way to persuade him, but Arjuna is a great
intellectual; he goes on arguing against him. Finally seeing no other
way, Krishna takes the last resort and says, “It is written in your
destiny. Going away, you are going away from God. This war is
predetermined by God to destroy those who are not virtuous and only let
those survive who are virtuous.” Now there is no argument against it,
because Arjuna himself believes in God and destiny.</p><p><br></p><p>Arjuna fought the war. Krishna was responsible, five thousand years
ago, for destroying this country by giving a false argument, absolutely
fictitious, to Arjuna. That war killed so many people. And it is not
only that it killed people, it also destroyed the courage of the
country; it became afraid of any small calamity.</p><p><br></p><p>Two thousand years of slavery.… I want to make it absolutely clear
that the people who are responsible for these two thousand years of
slavery are the greatest people of India. The list is headed by Krishna;
Arjuna is just his shadow. Then came Mahavira, who taught people to be
nonviolent to such an extreme that his followers cannot even cultivate,
because plants have life; if you cultivate then you will have to kill
the plants when you reap the crop. Gautam Buddha comes third, who taught
people to accept, to be contented wherever and with whatever they have –
poor, hungry, starving, enslaved, remain utterly contented.</p><p><br></p><p>Their teachings were great. This is something to be remembered;
otherwise I will be misunderstood by everyone. Their teachings were
great, but they never thought about all the implications of their
teachings. They never thought that if you teach a country nonviolence,
if you teach a country to drop all weapons, when the whole world is not
doing that, then you are putting that country in a state of being
victimized, exploited by anyone.</p><p><br></p><p>And for two thousand years invader after invader came to India,
exploited it and went back. Finally Mohammedans came and they thought,
“What is the need to go back? We can not only exploit people, but rule
them and remain here.” And then came the Britishers and the French and
the Portuguese, and they all tried to exploit the country. They all had
their small pockets. Britain proved to be far more clever. But the
Portuguese had their small islands of Diu, Daman and Goa, and the French
had a small portion of the country, Pondicherry. Britain had the whole
country.</p><p><br></p><p>People have remained starved and hungry, and people have gone on
dying because of hunger, and nobody has ever thought that these great
principles in some way are responsible for this unfortunate situation
that for thousands of years India has had to pass through. And even
today nobody is trying to see all the implications. Every great
principle has its own black cloud behind it. And unless you understand
the black cloud also, you are soon going to be absorbed by the black
cloud. If you understand it, you can avoid it.</p><p><br></p><p>God seems to be the greatest principle that has been preached to man
down the ages, but nobody has looked at its implications. If God created
man then man has no individuality of his own, then he cannot claim any
dignity, any freedom. There is no question of a puppet declaring, “I
want to be free.” If God created the universe, then whatever has
happened in the universe has had to happen. It was God’s will. No effort
on our part was going to change anything.</p><p><br></p><p>And finally you can see, if God created the world, and if he is
behind nuclear weapons and the people who are creating them, then no
effort on man’s part can prevent the destruction of the whole</p><p>planet. To give the creation of the world into the hands of a
fictitious God is very dangerous. It makes us absolutely impotent. We
cannot do anything.</p><p><br></p><p>Hence, my simple understanding of consciousness is that if God did
not die with Friedrich Nietzsche’s declaration, then we have to kill
him! Wherever you meet him, there is no need even to say hello. First
kill him and then you can say hello – just to fulfill the formality. But
God is not needed at all. With God above in the sky, man will always
remain a slave, and man will always remain unconscious, and man will
never strive to reach to the peaks of his potential. With God removed
you may feel a little fear – just out of old habit – but that fear will
disappear.</p><p><br></p><p>Once you recognize that you are standing on your own feet and you
have to do something to create a better consciousness in you, to create
a more loving heart in you, that prayers are useless, there is nobody to
answer them... Yes, sometimes they have been answered. At least once,
certainly.…</p><p><br></p><p>A poor man asked God for months continually, “Give me fifty dollars.
I don’t want much, just fifty dollars.”</p><p><br></p><p>First he prayed, but then he thought, “Millions of people are
praying, and there is one God and there are millions of prayers. Whether
my poor prayer ever reaches to him... And there must be around him so
much noise – prayers from all the churches, all the mosques, all the
synagogues, all the temples – who is going to take care of me? It is
better that I write a letter.”</p><p><br></p><p>He wrote a letter saying, “This is to remind you that for months I
have been praying, but the answer has not come. It seems my prayer has
not reached you. I can understand, because of the noise around you of so
many prayers. And great people are praying – the pope and the archbishop
and the shankaracharya – so who is going to take care of my small
prayer? And I am not asking much – no paradise, no heaven, nothing, just
fifty dollars. Finally I decided to write the letter.” And he wrote in
big letters, “FIFTY DOLLARS! Remember, it is urgent.”</p><p><br></p><p>But then he was very much disturbed, because he didn’t know the
address, whom to address it to. He thought, “The best way is to address
it to: God, c/o The Postmaster General. If the postmaster general cannot
find his address, who else can?” The letter reached the postmaster
general. He looked, he laughed, and then he felt sad also. He thought,
“The man must be in desperate need – nobody writes letters to God. And
he is not asking much.”</p><p><br></p><p>So he said to all his friends, “Please look at this poor man’s
letter. You all contribute, and we will send those fifty dollars to him.
At least for once let a prayer be answered.” They collected the money,
but they collected only forty-five dollars. The postmaster general said,
“No harm, at least we should send this much.”</p><p><br></p><p>When forty-five dollars reached the man he counted the dollars, and
he looked above and shouted, “God, remember one thing. Next time you
send any money to me, never send it through the post office! Those
cunning fellows have taken out their commission. I have received only
forty-five dollars!”</p><p><br></p><p>Except this, I have not come across any prayer which has been
answered – and that too not fully. There is no one to answer. Existence
has to be approached in a different way.</p><p>God has to be worshipped. Existence has to be loved. God has to be
prayed to.</p><p>Existence has to be contacted in meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>There are only two kinds of religions in the world: the religions of
prayer and the religions of meditation. You can see my point. The
religions of prayer all believe in God and the religions of meditation
don’t believe in any god. Because meditation takes you inwards, and
fulfills you, there is no need to pray, there is no need for any
consolation. You are in such a rejoicing, in such a blissful state; you
can bless the whole world.</p><p><br></p><p>I teach you existence, and the entry into existence is through your
own being; hence meditation is not prayer – remember, it is against
prayer. Prayer is part of that phony jargon about God, heaven, hell.
Prayer is part and parcel of that whole rubbish. Meditation is simply
the only pure way of coming in contact with existence. And this contact
immediately becomes a merger and a melting. You become existence
yourself. Then you are in the clouds and you are in the stars and you
are in the flowers and you are in the rains. You are everywhere. You are
no longer a drop, you have become the ocean.</p><p><br></p><p>Sampurna, remember the clear-cut distinction between existence and
God. God is a condemnation of our intelligence. It is accepting
humiliation, it is accepting that, “We are only puppets; you are the
power. Whatever you want to do with us you will do. All that we can do
is to pray.” It makes you so crippled. The very idea of God is
nauseating. But existence has a freshness and a beauty and a truth.</p><p><br></p><p>Never get mixed up with these two words. One is reality, one is
simply fiction. Question 2</p><p>BELOVED MASTER,</p><p><br></p><p>WE HAVE HEARD YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT JAZZ MUSIC.</p><p><br></p><p>BELOVED MASTER, THIS QUESTION COMES FROM TWO JAZZ MUSICIANS: IS OUR
LOVE OF JAZZ MUSIC AN OBSTACLE ON THE PATH TO ENLIGHTENMENT?</p><p><br></p><p>Satyam and Dhyanesh, my comments about jazz music were made in a
totally different context. Compared to classical music, jazz music is in
the lowest category, because rather than creating a spirituality in you
it simply activates your sexuality. The great classical music takes you
higher, beyond your mind, to silences which can give you a taste of
meditation, a taste of existence.</p><p><br></p><p>But always remember that a certain reference in a certain context
does not mean my whole approach to a thing. You are saying, “This
question comes from two jazz musicians. Is our love of jazz music an
obstacle on the path to enlightenment?” It depends on you. You can make
your jazz music free</p><p>from the lower gravitation of sexuality. You can make it connected
with your higher centers of being, and then it will not be an obstacle
on the path to enlightenment.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, as far as my people are concerned, they are going to enter
enlightenment with jazz music! It has never been tried; hence it is a
great challenge and must be tried.</p><p><br></p><p>Nothing is wrong in the world if it is used in the right direction –
with awareness, with clarity. You can purify anything, just as you can
make anything impure. It is wholly a question of your clear
understanding. If your meditation goes on growing side by side with your
music, soon you will find that even jazz music starts having some
quality of meditativeness. And if the distinction between music and
meditation drops, then whatever classical music was able to do, you can
also do it. And you can do it more rejoicingly, more dancingly, with a
greater celebration.</p><p><br></p><p>So I don’t say that there is any obstacle, but meditation must become
part of your music; otherwise just your music cannot help you to go
beyond the lower instincts, biological drives. It will keep you closer
to the earth, but far away from the stars.</p><p><br></p><p>Pope the Polack and Ronald Reagan meet in the middle of the Sahara
desert. The pope is carrying a telephone booth, while Ronald Reagan has
a car engine strapped to his back.</p><p><br></p><p>“What are you doing with that telephone booth?” asks Reagan.</p><p><br></p><p>“You see,” says Pope the Polack, “if a lion comes along, I put it
down, go inside and lock the door. But why are you carrying a car engine
with you?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well,” replies Reagan, “for just the same reason. When a lion comes
I drop the engine and then I can run faster.”</p><p><br></p><p>Hymie Goldberg is trying to hold a small mirror in his hand while he
adjusts his tie. The mirror slips and shatters on the ground.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, no!” he complains to Becky. “Now I am going to have seven years’
bad luck.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Nonsense,” replies Becky. “My uncle Sollie once broke a mirror, and
he didn’t have seven years’ bad luck.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Really?” says Hymie, encouraged.</p><p><br></p><p>“Really,” repeats Becky. “He died the same day.” It all depends how
you understand things.…</p><p>Miss Goodbody, the teacher, is too shy to conduct the sex education

Grandma says that she was found under a gooseberry bush. Great-grandma
blushes deep red and whispers that children come from God.</p><p>The next day, little Ernie gets called to report on his homework.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well,” says Ernie, “I am afraid my family has been a little
abnormal. Apparently there has been no sex at all for three
generations.”</p><p><br></p><p>Paddy Murphy is on his way home, when he comes across a woman crying
hysterically. “What is the matter, lady?” he asks.</p><p>“MacTavish is dead!” she sobs. “MacTavish is dead!”</p><p><br></p><p>A few minutes later he comes across another woman sobbing, “MacTavish
is dead! MacTavish is dead!”</p><p><br></p><p>Soon he finds another woman crying the same thing, and then as he

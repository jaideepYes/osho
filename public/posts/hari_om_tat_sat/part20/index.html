WILL YOU SPEAK ON THE AESTHETICS OF CONSCIOUSNESS? HAVE YOU EVER SPOKEN OF ANYTHING ELSE?\nVadan and Iti, you have raised a very significant question. All the religions that have existed on the earth have been very unaesthetic, because they denied life, they denied all the beauties, all the flowers, all creativity, sensitivity.\nThey killed millions of people’s possibility of attaining to enlightenment through aesthetic creativity. They simply closed the door, and for centuries nobody has even asked the question, “Is it possible that just to be a musician is enough to become enlightened?” I say yes.\nNobody will agree with me – neither Mahavira nor Gautam Buddha nor Mohammed nor Jesus. Knowing it well, that the whole history will stand against me, I am absolutely certain that music can become meditation, that sculpture can become meditation, that dancing can become meditation, that painting can become meditation. These doors have simply been closed. It is one of the greatest crimes committed against man.\nAnd people who are uncreative are praised as saints. All that they have done may be fasting. But being hungry is not a great quality, and it does not enhance humanity in any way. They may have\nlived naked, but that does not mean they are making life more beautiful. Most of these naked saints are so ugly that it would have been better... they should be praised if they stop being naked. But their nakedness has been praised; it is thought to be a great discipline.\nSometimes stupid ideas carried for a long time almost start looking like ultimate truths. All the animals are naked. I don’t see any saintliness in being naked. I am not saying that to be naked is criminal, I am simply saying that if the time is right and the climate is beautiful and you have a body worth seeing... First stand naked before the mirror before you disturb other people. But on a sea beach, of course, you can be naked; in a good climate, in the home you can be naked. But there is nothing saintly in it, it is simply natural. Every animal, every bird is naked – except a few dogs.\nIn the Victorian age in England, where morality became hilarious, even dogs were covered with clothes. This was thought to be very Christian. You will not believe it, even the legs of the chairs and tables were covered – because they are called legs and legs should not be left naked. Except for those few idiots, the whole world of the animals has remained natural.\nFor man perhaps it is now difficult to be naked in all the seasons. His body is no longer capable, is no longer so strong as it was in the age of the primitive man who lived naked. For thousands of years we have protected our bodies. But remember, whenever anything is protected it becomes weaker. The more you protect, the weaker it becomes. A primitive man in the jungles of India still lives naked – in the winter, in the rain, in the hot sun – but he has the stamina and he has the body. But he is not a saint, he is simply uncultured, uneducated, uncivilized, primitive. There is nothing that can be said in praise of him.\nBut religions have been preaching to people very uncreative disciplines, which are sometimes so funny that even to believe that thousands of people live under those beliefs seems impossible.\nIn India, Jainism is a religion whose monks, step by step, finally become naked. In five stages of discipline, the last stage of their discipline is to be naked. Because of this stage Jainism has to deny women direct entry into their paradise. First they will have to become men, because they cannot attain the final stage of discipline, of nakedness.\nAnd the people who became naked... through twenty-five centuries continuously, thousands of people have become naked, and they have not contributed anything to the world, have not painted, have not written poetry. In fact, these are mundane affairs, worldly things, which they have renounced. In every way their disciplines have made them ugly.\nFor example, the Jaina monk eats standing. Now, if you eat standing, soon you will have a big belly. Your chest will sink and your belly will become bigger. You will be pregnant without pregnancy! They have to eat food in their cupped hands because they cannot use any kind of instruments. What nonsense! To use a plate is not great technology. But they are praised because they are using only their hands, and that creates many problems.\nThey cannot use a razor blade to shave their beards or their hair. And the problem becomes more complicated because they are not allowed to have a bath at all. Their discipline does not even allow them to have a mouthwash. They don’t brush their teeth, because the brush is great technology, and toothpaste is certainly manufactured in great factories. They have disowned the whole world – how can they use a brush? And why should they use one?\nTheir logic is worth understanding, because that will explain many other things in other religions. They are the extreme and the extreme is always good to understand, because things have come to the very climax where even a blind man can see that it is stupid.\nThey have to pull out their hair every year with their own hands. And that is celebrated as a great religious ceremony. Thousands gather to see the naked monk pulling out his hair. He cannot use a razor blade – the razor blade belongs to the materialist world. And it is worth seeing the scene when a Jaina monk pulls out his hair. Thousands of Jainas gather and women are crying, a few have fainted. The great saint is going through so much suffering.\nWho has told him to go through so much suffering? Anybody can give him a free shave. Now, he has imposed upon himself a stupid thing and people are praising him for his great disciplined life. This is not discipline, this is self-torture. And the reason is that he is not the body, so why should he take a bath? Now, the body without you cannot take the bath, that is certain. The body without you cannot have a good mouthwash.\nThe reasoning goes that people try to decorate their body. Your brushing the teeth – you may have never thought – is condemned by the Jainas because it is beautifying your body, which is really part of your sexuality. Having a bath, having a beautiful body, a good hairstyle, is certainly indicative that you are interested in bodies. If you are interested in your own body, you are certainly interested in other people’s bodies also. And a man who has renounced the material world has also renounced his own body.\nIn fact these people are not saints. Looked at without any prejudice they are psychologically sick, masochists who enjoy torturing themselves. There are many in mad asylums but people don’t know that they are Jaina saints. You are unnecessarily putting them into a madhouse. They torture themselves and they enjoy it.\nThere are two pathological categories: One is of masochists, who enjoy being tortured, and the other is of sadists, who enjoy torturing others. And it is said that the only perfect marriage is between a sadist and a masochist. Certainly it will be perfect. The husband beats and the wife enjoys. And the husband enjoys because he is beating, or vice versa.\nI used to be a student of a professor whose every lecture started with the description of how he had been misbehaved with, mistreated by his wife that morning. One day I heard it, the next day I heard it, the third day I had to stand up. I said, “This is too much. I can say from the symptoms that you are a masochist.”\nHe said, “What do you mean?”\nI said, “I mean, you enjoy being tortured. Otherwise, what is the point? Here you teach economics – what relationship does it have with your wife? And before standing up I have enquired about everything. I have been to your wife too, because I never question anything without proper homework.”\nHis wife was really dangerous. The one who chose her... and it was a love marriage! She was bigger than the professor, stronger than the professor, uglier than the professor, in every way ahead\nof him. And I enquired of the people in the neighborhood. They said, “They are a strange couple. The wife beats the professor.”\nI said, “It is not news to me, because the professor himself, every day, begins his lecture with it. Half of the lecture is about how he has been mistreated, misbehaved with by his wife. He is not hiding it. And I have seen when he relates it... the joy on his face. Both need to be in psychiatric hospitals.”\nBut the neighbors said, “Whatever you may say, they are both happy.”\nI said, “That’s true. That’s the perfect marriage. The wife is perfectly happy; she beats the husband, tortures him in every way. Even with the doors open – neighbors are looking in and she is sitting on the chest of her husband.”\nI have never come across again such a perfect couple. And it was a love marriage. I don’t think that even before they got married things would have been different. In fact, this relationship of torture had brought them together.\nMy understanding is that the people who are weeping and crying when a Jaina monk is pulling out his hair... he is a masochist and the crowd is made up of sadists. They are also enjoying; those tears should not mislead you. They have come from long distances just to see a madman pulling out his hair. But what is spiritual in it?\nAnd I started asking my parents, “What is spiritual in it?” A man may be naked... it is nobody’s business, let him be naked. If he pulls out his hair, perhaps he enjoys the exercise. Let him enjoy, just take care that he does not start pulling out other people’s hair. And that’s what the Jaina saint is doing. He is pulling out his hair and he is teaching others to be initiated, so finally they will have to pull out their hair. It is done in a very indirect way, but in fact he is torturing himself and teaching others, “Torture yourself. Without torturing your body, how can you attain to the spiritual?”\nThe division between the body and the spirit has destroyed all religions. Rather than becoming a blessing to the world, they prove to be a great calamity.\nI teach an aesthetic consciousness. You should learn to appreciate beauty, you should learn to create beauty, you should behave in a beautiful way. Your life should be a long story of beauty, grace, love, peace. And whatever you are doing, there is no need to renounce the world – there is nowhere to go. This is our world. We have to make it more beautiful, more graceful, more lovable. And it is possible, whatever you are doing, to do it meditatively.\nThere have been mystics like Kabir, who was a weaver. He remained a weaver, although he had kings as his followers, thousands of followers. And he was a poor man. Very few poor people have attained to the same grace and radiance as Kabir. And all his disciples prayed, “You stop weaving. You don’t have to, we are all here to support you, give you anything you need.”\nKabir said, “But my meditation and my weaving have grown so together that neither can I meditate without weaving, nor can I weave without meditation. So please don’t disturb me, just let me do whatever I have been doing.”\nAnother mystic was Gora. He was a potter and he continued to make beautiful pottery after his realization. His pottery also became of a different quality. Something of his beauty became part of what he was making.\nHis disciples said, “Stop, we feel ashamed. People say, ‘You go to a potter?’” – in India a potter is counted as an untouchable – “‘And you touch the feet of that man?’” But still, thousands of people became illuminated by Gora’s experience. And he remained a potter to the very end.\nWhatever you are doing, my approach is, make your doing your meditation. Don’t think in terms that you have to leave something and then you will meditate. Those are tricks of the mind of postponing, and you will end up in some ugly situation.\nTo me, religion can only be aesthetic and nothing else. A religious man will be in every way graceful. His very being will be surrounded by an aura of beauty. His words will be poetry itself; his silences will touch your heart; his very being will become a dance and celebration for you. What he does is not the question. What he is is the question. Whether he is a potter or a weaver or a shoemaker...\nThere was a shoemaker also who was a mystic, Raidas. If a shoemaker can be as realized as a Gautam Buddha, then there is no need to go anywhere. Just be wherever you are, create more beauty, create more grace in your life, in your actions. Everything should be a prayer, a gratitude to existence. Then a totally different kind of religion will prevail in the world, which will be bringing great treasures to the world.\nUp to now all the religions have been escapist – escape from the world. I teach you to remain in the world; just remember, don’t be worldly. There is no need to renounce the world, just don’t let the world enter into your consciousness. You can sit in the Himalayas and still go on thinking about Sophia Loren. The Himalayas cannot prevent you.\nOnce a man came to Ramakrishna with ten thousand golden pieces. At that time the rupee was pure gold. The very word ‘rupee’ is from Sanskrit; it means gold. He came with ten thousand gold pieces in a big bag and told Ramakrishna, “I have been collecting and waiting – when they become ten thousand, I am going to offer them to you.”\nRamakrishna said, “But I don’t have any place to keep them. And anyway, I don’t think I need them. But I cannot refuse you either. Do one thing...” Just behind Ramakrishna’s temple was flowing the beautiful Ganges. He said to the man, “Go and throw the whole load into the Ganges.”\nNow, Ramakrishna was saying it. And in the first place he had offered the rupees to Ramakrishna, so they belonged to him, and he was saying it. So very reluctantly he went. His heart was sinking. His whole life he had been collecting those rupees. “And that fellow seems to be absolutely insane. What will the Ganges do with them? If he does not need them, he could have told me so. I could have taken them back. If he does not need, the Ganges does not need either. But what to do, how to argue with the man? That man is mad!”\nOne hour passed. Ramakrishna enquired, “What happened? That man has not returned.”\nSomebody was sent and he informed Ramakrishna, “That man is doing a great job. He has created a big crowd. Many are swimming in the Ganges, many are standing on the bank. He takes one\nrupee at a time, shows to the whole crowd that it is pure gold by throwing it on a stone – the sound of the gold – and then he throws it into the Ganges.\n“So it is a very long process. Ten thousand rupees... and the crowd is gathering and those who can swim, those who can catch the thrown rupees, they are enjoying.”\nRamakrishna said, “This is strange. I had told him to throw the whole lot.”\nHe himself went to see. It was really a great festival there. Ramakrishna tapped the man on the shoulder and said, “What are you doing?”\nHe said, “Nothing. Just I check whether the gold is real or not and then I count: three hundred thirty-nine, three hundred forty, three hundred forty-one...”\nRamakrishna said, “You idiot. When somebody is collecting money, certainly he checks whether it is real gold or not and he also counts. But when you are throwing it away, why bother? Just throw the whole bag in one go.”\nHe had to do that, but very sadly. He was enjoying his life’s greatest moment, because so many people were appreciating him, that this is great renunciation, throwing away wealth.\nAll the religions have been teaching, throw away wealth. And then all around the world millions of people are starving, dying in poverty. No religion has taught, create wealth. Wealth is not something that comes from the sky; it has to be created. Not everybody is a Henry Ford. It needs intelligence, it needs inventiveness, it needs many qualities; only then can man create wealth. If all the religions had taught the people, “Create wealth and we will respect the wealthiest as the saints,” the world would not be poor. There is no reason for the world to be poor.\nEven today, although the population has got to five billion, the scientists say that if we put all our intelligence and scientific and technological understanding together, we can make not only five billion people healthy, wealthy, comfortable, we can make twenty-five billion people live perfectly happily on this earth. But all the religions have been teaching poverty. Jesus says, “Blessed are the poor.” And everybody knows who is blessed! But these consoling lies have helped the poor to remain poor. Jesus says that those who are rich, they don’t have any hope. “Even a camel can pass through the eye of the needle, but not a rich man through the gates of heaven.”\nNow, if this kind of teaching has been rampant all over the world, you see the ultimate result. Thousands of people are dying every day just because there is not enough food. Just by the end of this century, only in India five hundred million people will die, if the situation remains the same. And there seems to be no possibility that this situation will change.\nIndia does not produce food, it only produces children. It is a very productive land! When it became independent in 1947, its population was only four hundred million. Today its population is nine hundred million. Just in forty years the population has increased by five hundred million, and within the coming ten years India will pass beyond one billion.\nFor the first time, India will be the leading nation in the world as far as poverty, hunger, starvation, population is concerned. Up to now China has been the leader, but in the coming ten years China is going to lose its permanent position. It has been the leading nation up to now – no more.\nA man was saying to his wife, “In this newspaper is some report about population. It says that in every five children born on the earth, one is a Chinese.” This will not be the case after ten years – in every five children born on the earth, one will be an Indian. The wife was very much worried. She said, “My God. I am pregnant and this is my fifth child, and I don’t want a Chinese in the house!”\nReligions have been teaching wrong values. Man would have been in a totally different position... They have not taught how to live in tune with nature, in tune with ecology; they have not taught how to live with each other without continuous killing, massacre, rape. In three thousand years there have been five thousand wars – as if man’s only profession is to fight. For whom are you fighting?\nIf religions had taught, “Instead of being destructive, be creative. Rather than renouncing the world, renounce the nation, renounce the race; renounce all discriminations between black and white; renounce all limitations, boundaries that divide humanity. It is one humanity. This planet is our home, and we are all responsible to make it more beautiful, more livable...” But they were teaching, “Renounce this world, escape from this world.” And where will these people escape to? They don’t escape anywhere, they simply live here. They become parasites.\nNow there are thousands of monasteries in China, in Japan, in India, in Europe. In these monasteries there are thousands of monks. Who feeds them? They don’t create anything. All that they have created in the whole of history is the disease AIDS, nothing else. That is their only positive contribution! Homosexuality, sodomy... but their highest point is the disease AIDS. And they had renounced the world. Then why do they go on sitting on our necks? They should go and jump into the ocean. They have renounced the world; we can tell them goodbye. But they live here, they torture us, and they go on preaching all those ugly teachings which have made this earth so suicidal, so meaningless, so utterly poor in every dimension of life.\nMy basic interest is in bringing religiousness to life, to the marketplace, and in destroying the antagonism that has been created by all the religions between religiousness and the world. There is no antagonism. Religiousness is a beautiful flower; it can blossom in the marketplace, there is no problem, because religiousness can be reduced to a simple principle of meditation. There is no need of any other discipline.\nJust as you deepen your meditativeness, your awareness becomes more and more crystal-clear, your life starts becoming more moral. Not according to any scripture, because they are all old and dead, and the situation in which they were written does not exist anymore. A moral person, according to me, is one who is capable of responding to the real situation directly, not according to any principle.\nI am reminded of a Chinese story. There was a fair. And in old China the wells, water wells, were not protected by walls around them. They were open holes. In the night, in darkness, you could fall into a water well.\nA man had fallen into a water well, but there was a fair – so much noise, so many people, who would hear his... he was shouting with his whole energy, “Help, I am dying!”\nJust by chance a Buddhist monk passing by heard the man and looked down into the well. The man said, “Thank God you have heard; otherwise in this fair people are so mad, all kinds of noises are going on – music, dance, singing – who is going to listen to me?”\nThe Buddhist monk said, “Don’t be worried, I will listen to you.”\nHe said, “It is not a question of listening! You have to take me out of the well.”\nThe Buddhist monk said, “That I cannot do, because according to my scripture, everybody has to suffer for his own evil acts done in past lives. You must have done evil acts. Suffer silently, be peaceful so that in the next life you don’t have to suffer. Take care of the next life. What has happened has happened.”\nThat man said, “I am still alive! All has not happened. I am young, my wife is there, my children are there, and you are saying all that has happened has happened. Do something!”\nHe said, “I cannot go against my scripture.” And he went away.\nHe was followed by a Confucian monk. The monk said, “Confucius was right.” The man said, “I agree, but first get me out!”\nHe said, “That will happen, but it will take time. A great revolution is needed.” The man said, “But by that time... what revolution are you talking about?”\nThe monk said, “Confucius has written that every well should have a protective wall. I will go all over the country for your sake, for your children’s sake, saying that every well should be protected with a wall.”\nThe man said, “But, what about me?” He said, “As for you... I cannot do anything. Nobody listened to Confucius – what can I do? But as for your children, certainly nobody will fall.”\nThe man said, “This is a strange place. A living man is dying and these idiots are talking about great revolutions.”\nThen came a Christian with a rope, with a bucket, and he immediately threw the rope in and the bucket and told the man, “Sit in the bucket and I will pull you out, don’t be worried.”\nThe man said, “This seems to be the only real religion. All those others are very cunning people talking about scriptures.”\nHe said to the Christian missionary, “Your religion is the only true religion. But by the way, I want to ask, why were you carrying a rope and a bucket?”\nThe missionary said, “I am always on the safe side. Who knows? Somebody may have fallen, and this is the only way I can enter paradise. I am going to oppose that Confucian monk who is trying to make walls around every well. Then nobody will fall, and if nobody falls there will be no need of saviors. The door of paradise will be closed.”\nThe man understood for the first time that he was not being saved. The missionary was making his own account, bank balance in paradise.\nAll these scriptures, all these religions, all these moralities may have been useful in certain circumstances, but life goes on changing. Every moment is new. So there are two ways of receiving the new moment that is knocking on your door. One is reaction: reaction comes from your principles, scriptures, knowledge, your church. And the other is response: response comes from your awareness. Except response there is no morality. Without response, whatever you do is going to lead you into some stupidity.\nYou see in Poona there are so many non-vegetarian mosquitoes. I have not heard of any species of mosquito which is vegetarian. You may not believe that in Calcutta the rich vegetarians have many cots in their gardens. Anybody who is ready to lie down on those cots, naked, the whole night, is paid. It happens even today.\nThey are so compassionate about the mosquitoes, because what will happen to those mosquitoes? Their scriptures say save people, help people. They are saving people, helping people. Those people are the mosquitoes! And just giving five rupees to a man... he suffers the whole night, but it is worth five rupees. He will fight with the mosquitoes, but he will remain on the bed. And the people who are paying him are doing a virtuous act of paying the hungry.\nNow, this net around the Buddha Auditorium is very much against the scriptures, because it is preventing the hungry. It is very immoral – so much good food and hungry people all around, but barriers... That’s why people are against me – I teach against the scriptures.\nNow a few religious things. You force me to talk about irreligion, but I don’t forget the real religious things.\nA young Arab returns to his tent late one night, very hungry. He lights a candle and starts to look through his bag for some food until he finds four dates. Taking out his knife, he cuts open a date to find it full of worms. He cuts open a second date, but it too has worms. The third date also has worms.\nHe sighs deeply, blows out the candle, and eats the last date.\nA Canadian farmer is chopping wood to store it for the winter when an old Indian comes out of the forest and says, “Cold winter this year.”\nHearing this, the farmer decides to chop more wood than usual. The following day he is still chopping when the old Indian appears again and says, “Very cold winter this year.”\nSo the farmer keeps chopping late into the night. The following day he is at it again and by now he has a huge pile of wood when the old Indian comes by and says, “Very, very cold winter this year.”\nThe farmer stops chopping and says, “Hey chief, how do you know that?”\n“Well,” says the Indian, “in my tribe we have a maxim which says: Cold weather comes to the neighborhood when you see the white man chopping wood.”\nMoishe Finkelstein gets a nasty letter from the tax office and he has to go for an interview. He phones his son, Fagin the lawyer, for some advice, and Fagin suggests that he wears old clothes so that he does not look too prosperous.\nOn the way to the tax office, Moishe bumps into Mendel Kravitz who tells him that dressed in this way he looks like a rascal and that the tax officer would immediately suspect something.\nMoishe is very confused so he goes to visit Rabbi Nussbaum. The rabbi is out, but his wife lets Moishe into the house.\n“What is your trouble?” she asks. And Moishe tells her his story.\n“Aha!” she replies at the end of the tale. “This reminds me of when I was about to get married. I could not decide whether to wear a white nightdress and look like a virgin, or a black one and look experienced and seductive, so I asked my grandmother for advice.”\n“Oy!” cries Moishe. “And what did she say?”\n“Well,” says the rabbi’s wife, “she told me, ‘It doesn’t matter what you wear – you’ll get fucked anyway.’”\nOkay, Maneesha?\nYes, Beloved Master.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"5031","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/hari_om_tat_sat/part20/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/hari_om_tat_sat/>Hari Om Tat Sat</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">20 Religion can only be aesthetic</h1><div class=post-meta>24 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;5031 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Hari_Om_Tat_Sat/part20.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part19>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

BECOME ENLIGHTENED IN THE MOST AESTHETIC WAY POSSIBLE. WILL YOU SPEAK ON
THE AESTHETICS OF CONSCIOUSNESS? HAVE YOU EVER SPOKEN OF ANYTHING
ELSE?</p><p><br></p><p>Vadan and Iti, you have raised a very significant question. All the
religions that have existed on the earth have been very unaesthetic,
because they denied life, they denied all the beauties, all the flowers,
all creativity, sensitivity.</p><p><br></p><p>They killed millions of people’s possibility of attaining to
enlightenment through aesthetic creativity. They simply closed the door,
and for centuries nobody has even asked the question, “Is it possible
that just to be a musician is enough to become enlightened?” I say
yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Nobody will agree with me – neither Mahavira nor Gautam Buddha nor
Mohammed nor Jesus. Knowing it well, that the whole history will stand
against me, I am absolutely certain that music can become meditation,
that sculpture can become meditation, that dancing can become
meditation, that painting can become meditation. These doors have simply
been closed. It is one of the greatest crimes committed against man.</p><p><br></p><p>And people who are uncreative are praised as saints. All that they
have done may be fasting. But being hungry is not a great quality, and
it does not enhance humanity in any way. They may have</p><p>lived naked, but that does not mean they are making life more
beautiful. Most of these naked saints are so ugly that it would have
been better... they should be praised if they stop being naked. But
their nakedness has been praised; it is thought to be a great
discipline.</p><p><br></p><p>Sometimes stupid ideas carried for a long time almost start looking
like ultimate truths. All the animals are naked. I don’t see any
saintliness in being naked. I am not saying that to be naked is
criminal, I am simply saying that if the time is right and the climate
is beautiful and you have a body worth seeing... First stand naked
before the mirror before you disturb other people. But on a sea beach,
of course, you can be naked; in a good climate, in the home you can be
naked. But there is nothing saintly in it, it is simply natural. Every
animal, every bird is naked – except a few dogs.</p><p><br></p><p>In the Victorian age in England, where morality became hilarious,
even dogs were covered with clothes. This was thought to be very
Christian. You will not believe it, even the legs of the chairs and
tables were covered – because they are called legs and legs should not
be left naked. Except for those few idiots, the whole world of the
animals has remained natural.</p><p><br></p><p>For man perhaps it is now difficult to be naked in all the seasons.
His body is no longer capable, is no longer so strong as it was in the
age of the primitive man who lived naked. For thousands of years we have
protected our bodies. But remember, whenever anything is protected it
becomes weaker. The more you protect, the weaker it becomes. A primitive
man in the jungles of India still lives naked – in the winter, in the
rain, in the hot sun – but he has the stamina and he has the body. But
he is not a saint, he is simply uncultured, uneducated, uncivilized,
primitive. There is nothing that can be said in praise of him.</p><p><br></p><p>But religions have been preaching to people very uncreative
disciplines, which are sometimes so funny that even to believe that
thousands of people live under those beliefs seems impossible.</p><p><br></p><p>In India, Jainism is a religion whose monks, step by step, finally
become naked. In five stages of discipline, the last stage of their
discipline is to be naked. Because of this stage Jainism has to deny
women direct entry into their paradise. First they will have to become
men, because they cannot attain the final stage of discipline, of
nakedness.</p><p><br></p><p>And the people who became naked... through twenty-five centuries
continuously, thousands of people have become naked, and they have not
contributed anything to the world, have not painted, have not written
poetry. In fact, these are mundane affairs, worldly things, which they
have renounced. In every way their disciplines have made them ugly.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, the Jaina monk eats standing. Now, if you eat standing,
soon you will have a big belly. Your chest will sink and your belly will
become bigger. You will be pregnant without pregnancy! They have to eat
food in their cupped hands because they cannot use any kind of
instruments. What nonsense! To use a plate is not great technology. But
they are praised because they are using only their hands, and that
creates many problems.</p><p><br></p><p>They cannot use a razor blade to shave their beards or their hair.
And the problem becomes more complicated because they are not allowed to
have a bath at all. Their discipline does not even allow them to have a
mouthwash. They don’t brush their teeth, because the brush is great
technology, and toothpaste is certainly manufactured in great factories.
They have disowned the whole world – how can they use a brush? And why
should they use one?</p><p>Their logic is worth understanding, because that will explain many
other things in other religions. They are the extreme and the extreme is
always good to understand, because things have come to the very climax
where even a blind man can see that it is stupid.</p><p><br></p><p>They have to pull out their hair every year with their own hands. And
that is celebrated as a great religious ceremony. Thousands gather to
see the naked monk pulling out his hair. He cannot use a razor blade –
the razor blade belongs to the materialist world. And it is worth seeing
the scene when a Jaina monk pulls out his hair. Thousands of Jainas
gather and women are crying, a few have fainted. The great saint is
going through so much suffering.</p><p><br></p><p>Who has told him to go through so much suffering? Anybody can give
him a free shave. Now, he has imposed upon himself a stupid thing and
people are praising him for his great disciplined life. This is not
discipline, this is self-torture. And the reason is that he is not the
body, so why should he take a bath? Now, the body without you cannot
take the bath, that is certain. The body without you cannot have a good
mouthwash.</p><p><br></p><p>The reasoning goes that people try to decorate their body. Your
brushing the teeth – you may have never thought – is condemned by the
Jainas because it is beautifying your body, which is really part of your
sexuality. Having a bath, having a beautiful body, a good hairstyle, is
certainly indicative that you are interested in bodies. If you are
interested in your own body, you are certainly interested in other
people’s bodies also. And a man who has renounced the material world has
also renounced his own body.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact these people are not saints. Looked at without any prejudice
they are psychologically sick, masochists who enjoy torturing
themselves. There are many in mad asylums but people don’t know that
they are Jaina saints. You are unnecessarily putting them into a
madhouse. They torture themselves and they enjoy it.</p><p><br></p><p>There are two pathological categories: One is of masochists, who
enjoy being tortured, and the other is of sadists, who enjoy torturing
others. And it is said that the only perfect marriage is between a
sadist and a masochist. Certainly it will be perfect. The husband beats
and the wife enjoys. And the husband enjoys because he is beating, or
vice versa.</p><p><br></p><p>I used to be a student of a professor whose every lecture started
with the description of how he had been misbehaved with, mistreated by
his wife that morning. One day I heard it, the next day I heard it, the
third day I had to stand up. I said, “This is too much. I can say from
the symptoms that you are a masochist.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “What do you mean?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I mean, you enjoy being tortured. Otherwise, what is the
point? Here you teach economics – what relationship does it have with
your wife? And before standing up I have enquired about everything. I
have been to your wife too, because I never question anything without
proper homework.”</p><p><br></p><p>His wife was really dangerous. The one who chose her... and it was a
love marriage! She was bigger than the professor, stronger than the
professor, uglier than the professor, in every way ahead</p><p>of him. And I enquired of the people in the neighborhood. They said,
“They are a strange couple. The wife beats the professor.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “It is not news to me, because the professor himself, every
day, begins his lecture with it. Half of the lecture is about how he has
been mistreated, misbehaved with by his wife. He is not hiding it. And I
have seen when he relates it... the joy on his face. Both need to be in
psychiatric hospitals.”</p><p><br></p><p>But the neighbors said, “Whatever you may say, they are both
happy.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “That’s true. That’s the perfect marriage. The wife is
perfectly happy; she beats the husband, tortures him in every way. Even
with the doors open – neighbors are looking in and she is sitting on the
chest of her husband.”</p><p><br></p><p>I have never come across again such a perfect couple. And it was a
love marriage. I don’t think that even before they got married things
would have been different. In fact, this relationship of torture had
brought them together.</p><p><br></p><p>My understanding is that the people who are weeping and crying when a
Jaina monk is pulling out his hair... he is a masochist and the crowd is
made up of sadists. They are also enjoying; those tears should not
mislead you. They have come from long distances just to see a madman
pulling out his hair. But what is spiritual in it?</p><p><br></p><p>And I started asking my parents, “What is spiritual in it?” A man may
be naked... it is nobody’s business, let him be naked. If he pulls out
his hair, perhaps he enjoys the exercise. Let him enjoy, just take care
that he does not start pulling out other people’s hair. And that’s what
the Jaina saint is doing. He is pulling out his hair and he is teaching
others to be initiated, so finally they will have to pull out their
hair. It is done in a very indirect way, but in fact he is torturing
himself and teaching others, “Torture yourself. Without torturing your
body, how can you attain to the spiritual?”</p><p><br></p><p>The division between the body and the spirit has destroyed all
religions. Rather than becoming a blessing to the world, they prove to
be a great calamity.</p><p><br></p><p>I teach an aesthetic consciousness. You should learn to appreciate
beauty, you should learn to create beauty, you should behave in a
beautiful way. Your life should be a long story of beauty, grace, love,
peace. And whatever you are doing, there is no need to renounce the
world – there is nowhere to go. This is our world. We have to make it
more beautiful, more graceful, more lovable. And it is possible,
whatever you are doing, to do it meditatively.</p><p><br></p><p>There have been mystics like Kabir, who was a weaver. He remained a
weaver, although he had kings as his followers, thousands of followers.
And he was a poor man. Very few poor people have attained to the same
grace and radiance as Kabir. And all his disciples prayed, “You stop
weaving. You don’t have to, we are all here to support you, give you
anything you need.”</p><p><br></p><p>Kabir said, “But my meditation and my weaving have grown so together
that neither can I meditate without weaving, nor can I weave without
meditation. So please don’t disturb me, just let me do whatever I have
been doing.”</p><p>Another mystic was Gora. He was a potter and he continued to make
beautiful pottery after his realization. His pottery also became of a
different quality. Something of his beauty became part of what he was
making.</p><p><br></p><p>His disciples said, “Stop, we feel ashamed. People say, ‘You go to a
potter?’” – in India a potter is counted as an untouchable – “‘And you
touch the feet of that man?’” But still, thousands of people became
illuminated by Gora’s experience. And he remained a potter to the very
end.</p><p><br></p><p>Whatever you are doing, my approach is, make your doing your
meditation. Don’t think in terms that you have to leave something and
then you will meditate. Those are tricks of the mind of postponing, and
you will end up in some ugly situation.</p><p><br></p><p>To me, religion can only be aesthetic and nothing else. A religious
man will be in every way graceful. His very being will be surrounded by
an aura of beauty. His words will be poetry itself; his silences will
touch your heart; his very being will become a dance and celebration for
you. What he does is not the question. What he is is the question.
Whether he is a potter or a weaver or a shoemaker...</p><p><br></p><p>There was a shoemaker also who was a mystic, Raidas. If a shoemaker
can be as realized as a Gautam Buddha, then there is no need to go
anywhere. Just be wherever you are, create more beauty, create more
grace in your life, in your actions. Everything should be a prayer, a
gratitude to existence. Then a totally different kind of religion will
prevail in the world, which will be bringing great treasures to the
world.</p><p><br></p><p>Up to now all the religions have been escapist – escape from the
world. I teach you to remain in the world; just remember, don’t be
worldly. There is no need to renounce the world, just don’t let the
world enter into your consciousness. You can sit in the Himalayas and
still go on thinking about Sophia Loren. The Himalayas cannot prevent
you.</p><p><br></p><p>Once a man came to Ramakrishna with ten thousand golden pieces. At
that time the rupee was pure gold. The very word ‘rupee’ is from
Sanskrit; it means gold. He came with ten thousand gold pieces in a big
bag and told Ramakrishna, “I have been collecting and waiting – when
they become ten thousand, I am going to offer them to you.”</p><p><br></p><p>Ramakrishna said, “But I don’t have any place to keep them. And
anyway, I don’t think I need them. But I cannot refuse you either. Do
one thing...” Just behind Ramakrishna’s temple was flowing the beautiful
Ganges. He said to the man, “Go and throw the whole load into the
Ganges.”</p><p><br></p><p>Now, Ramakrishna was saying it. And in the first place he had offered
the rupees to Ramakrishna, so they belonged to him, and he was saying
it. So very reluctantly he went. His heart was sinking. His whole life
he had been collecting those rupees. “And that fellow seems to be
absolutely insane. What will the Ganges do with them? If he does not
need them, he could have told me so. I could have taken them back. If he
does not need, the Ganges does not need either. But what to do, how to
argue with the man? That man is mad!”</p><p><br></p><p>One hour passed. Ramakrishna enquired, “What happened? That man has
not returned.”</p><p><br></p><p>Somebody was sent and he informed Ramakrishna, “That man is doing a
great job. He has created a big crowd. Many are swimming in the Ganges,
many are standing on the bank. He takes one</p><p>rupee at a time, shows to the whole crowd that it is pure gold by
throwing it on a stone – the sound of the gold – and then he throws it
into the Ganges.</p><p>“So it is a very long process. Ten thousand rupees... and the crowd
is gathering and those who can swim, those who can catch the thrown
rupees, they are enjoying.”</p><p>Ramakrishna said, “This is strange. I had told him to throw the whole
lot.”</p><p><br></p><p>He himself went to see. It was really a great festival there.
Ramakrishna tapped the man on the shoulder and said, “What are you
doing?”</p><p>He said, “Nothing. Just I check whether the gold is real or not and
then I count: three hundred thirty-nine, three hundred forty, three
hundred forty-one...”</p><p>Ramakrishna said, “You idiot. When somebody is collecting money,
certainly he checks whether it is real gold or not and he also counts.
But when you are throwing it away, why bother? Just throw the whole bag
in one go.”</p><p>He had to do that, but very sadly. He was enjoying his life’s
greatest moment, because so many people were appreciating him, that this
is great renunciation, throwing away wealth.</p><p>All the religions have been teaching, throw away wealth. And then all
around the world millions of people are starving, dying in poverty. No
religion has taught, create wealth. Wealth is not something that comes
from the sky; it has to be created. Not everybody is a Henry Ford. It
needs intelligence, it needs inventiveness, it needs many qualities;
only then can man create wealth. If all the religions had taught the
people, “Create wealth and we will respect the wealthiest as the
saints,” the world would not be poor. There is no reason for the world
to be poor.</p><p>Even today, although the population has got to five billion, the
scientists say that if we put all our intelligence and scientific and
technological understanding together, we can make not only five billion
people healthy, wealthy, comfortable, we can make twenty-five billion
people live perfectly happily on this earth. But all the religions have
been teaching poverty. Jesus says, “Blessed are the poor.” And everybody
knows who is blessed! But these consoling lies have helped the poor to
remain poor. Jesus says that those who are rich, they don’t have any
hope. “Even a camel can pass through the eye of the needle, but not a
rich man through the gates of heaven.”</p><p>Now, if this kind of teaching has been rampant all over the world,
you see the ultimate result. Thousands of people are dying every day
just because there is not enough food. Just by the end of this century,
only in India five hundred million people will die, if the situation
remains the same. And there seems to be no possibility that this
situation will change.</p><p>India does not produce food, it only produces children. It is a very
productive land! When it became independent in 1947, its population was
only four hundred million. Today its population is nine hundred million.
Just in forty years the population has increased by five hundred
million, and within the coming ten years India will pass beyond one
billion.</p><p>For the first time, India will be the leading nation in the world as
far as poverty, hunger, starvation, population is concerned. Up to now
China has been the leader, but in the coming ten years China is going to
lose its permanent position. It has been the leading nation up to now –
no more.</p><p>A man was saying to his wife, “In this newspaper is some report about
population. It says that in every five children born on the earth, one
is a Chinese.” This will not be the case after ten years – in every five
children born on the earth, one will be an Indian. The wife was very
much worried. She said, “My God. I am pregnant and this is my fifth
child, and I don’t want a Chinese in the house!”</p><p><br></p><p>Religions have been teaching wrong values. Man would have been in a
totally different position... They have not taught how to live in tune
with nature, in tune with ecology; they have not taught how to live with
each other without continuous killing, massacre, rape. In three thousand
years there have been five thousand wars – as if man’s only profession
is to fight. For whom are you fighting?</p><p><br></p><p>If religions had taught, “Instead of being destructive, be creative.
Rather than renouncing the world, renounce the nation, renounce the
race; renounce all discriminations between black and white; renounce all
limitations, boundaries that divide humanity. It is one humanity. This
planet is our home, and we are all responsible to make it more
beautiful, more livable...” But they were teaching, “Renounce this
world, escape from this world.” And where will these people escape to?
They don’t escape anywhere, they simply live here. They become
parasites.</p><p><br></p><p>Now there are thousands of monasteries in China, in Japan, in India,
in Europe. In these monasteries there are thousands of monks. Who feeds
them? They don’t create anything. All that they have created in the
whole of history is the disease AIDS, nothing else. That is their only
positive contribution! Homosexuality, sodomy... but their highest point
is the disease AIDS. And they had renounced the world. Then why do they
go on sitting on our necks? They should go and jump into the ocean. They
have renounced the world; we can tell them goodbye. But they live here,
they torture us, and they go on preaching all those ugly teachings which
have made this earth so suicidal, so meaningless, so utterly poor in
every dimension of life.</p><p><br></p><p>My basic interest is in bringing religiousness to life, to the
marketplace, and in destroying the antagonism that has been created by
all the religions between religiousness and the world. There is no
antagonism. Religiousness is a beautiful flower; it can blossom in the
marketplace, there is no problem, because religiousness can be reduced
to a simple principle of meditation. There is no need of any other
discipline.</p><p><br></p><p>Just as you deepen your meditativeness, your awareness becomes more
and more crystal-clear, your life starts becoming more moral. Not
according to any scripture, because they are all old and dead, and the
situation in which they were written does not exist anymore. A moral
person, according to me, is one who is capable of responding to the real
situation directly, not according to any principle.</p><p><br></p><p>I am reminded of a Chinese story. There was a fair. And in old China
the wells, water wells, were not protected by walls around them. They
were open holes. In the night, in darkness, you could fall into a water
well.</p><p><br></p><p>A man had fallen into a water well, but there was a fair – so much
noise, so many people, who would hear his... he was shouting with his
whole energy, “Help, I am dying!”</p><p><br></p><p>Just by chance a Buddhist monk passing by heard the man and looked
down into the well. The man said, “Thank God you have heard; otherwise
in this fair people are so mad, all kinds of noises are going on –
music, dance, singing – who is going to listen to me?”</p><p>The Buddhist monk said, “Don’t be worried, I will listen to you.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “It is not a question of listening! You have to take me out
of the well.”</p><p><br></p><p>The Buddhist monk said, “That I cannot do, because according to my
scripture, everybody has to suffer for his own evil acts done in past
lives. You must have done evil acts. Suffer silently, be peaceful so
that in the next life you don’t have to suffer. Take care of the next
life. What has happened has happened.”</p><p><br></p><p>That man said, “I am still alive! All has not happened. I am young,
my wife is there, my children are there, and you are saying all that has
happened has happened. Do something!”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I cannot go against my scripture.” And he went away.</p><p><br></p><p>He was followed by a Confucian monk. The monk said, “Confucius was
right.” The man said, “I agree, but first get me out!”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “That will happen, but it will take time. A great revolution
is needed.” The man said, “But by that time... what revolution are you
talking about?”</p><p><br></p><p>The monk said, “Confucius has written that every well should have a
protective wall. I will go all over the country for your sake, for your
children’s sake, saying that every well should be protected with a
wall.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man said, “But, what about me?” He said, “As for you... I cannot
do anything. Nobody listened to Confucius – what can I do? But as for
your children, certainly nobody will fall.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man said, “This is a strange place. A living man is dying and
these idiots are talking about great revolutions.”</p><p><br></p><p>Then came a Christian with a rope, with a bucket, and he immediately
threw the rope in and the bucket and told the man, “Sit in the bucket
and I will pull you out, don’t be worried.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man said, “This seems to be the only real religion. All those
others are very cunning people talking about scriptures.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said to the Christian missionary, “Your religion is the only true
religion. But by the way, I want to ask, why were you carrying a rope
and a bucket?”</p><p><br></p><p>The missionary said, “I am always on the safe side. Who knows?
Somebody may have fallen, and this is the only way I can enter paradise.
I am going to oppose that Confucian monk who is trying to make walls
around every well. Then nobody will fall, and if nobody falls there will
be no need of saviors. The door of paradise will be closed.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man understood for the first time that he was not being saved.
The missionary was making his own account, bank balance in paradise.</p><p>All these scriptures, all these religions, all these moralities may
have been useful in certain circumstances, but life goes on changing.
Every moment is new. So there are two ways of receiving the new moment
that is knocking on your door. One is reaction: reaction comes from your
principles, scriptures, knowledge, your church. And the other is
response: response comes from your awareness. Except response there is
no morality. Without response, whatever you do is going to lead you into
some stupidity.</p><p>You see in Poona there are so many non-vegetarian mosquitoes. I have
not heard of any species of mosquito which is vegetarian. You may not
believe that in Calcutta the rich vegetarians have many cots in their
gardens. Anybody who is ready to lie down on those cots, naked, the
whole night, is paid. It happens even today.</p><p>They are so compassionate about the mosquitoes, because what will
happen to those mosquitoes? Their scriptures say save people, help
people. They are saving people, helping people. Those people are the
mosquitoes! And just giving five rupees to a man... he suffers the whole
night, but it is worth five rupees. He will fight with the mosquitoes,
but he will remain on the bed. And the people who are paying him are
doing a virtuous act of paying the hungry.</p><p>Now, this net around the Buddha Auditorium is very much against the
scriptures, because it is preventing the hungry. It is very immoral – so
much good food and hungry people all around, but barriers... That’s why
people are against me – I teach against the scriptures.</p><p><br></p><p>Now a few religious things. You force me to talk about irreligion,
but I don’t forget the real religious things.</p><p><br></p><p>A young Arab returns to his tent late one night, very hungry. He
lights a candle and starts to look through his bag for some food until
he finds four dates. Taking out his knife, he cuts open a date to find
it full of worms. He cuts open a second date, but it too has worms. The
third date also has worms.</p><p><br></p><p>He sighs deeply, blows out the candle, and eats the last date.</p><p><br></p><p>A Canadian farmer is chopping wood to store it for the winter when an
old Indian comes out of the forest and says, “Cold winter this
year.”</p><p><br></p><p>Hearing this, the farmer decides to chop more wood than usual. The
following day he is still chopping when the old Indian appears again and
says, “Very cold winter this year.”</p><p><br></p><p>So the farmer keeps chopping late into the night. The following day
he is at it again and by now he has a huge pile of wood when the old
Indian comes by and says, “Very, very cold winter this year.”</p><p><br></p><p>The farmer stops chopping and says, “Hey chief, how do you know
that?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well,” says the Indian, “in my tribe we have a maxim which says:
Cold weather comes to the neighborhood when you see the white man
chopping wood.”</p><p><br></p><p>Moishe Finkelstein gets a nasty letter from the tax office and he has
to go for an interview. He phones his son, Fagin the lawyer, for some
advice, and Fagin suggests that he wears old clothes so that he does not
look too prosperous.</p><p>On the way to the tax office, Moishe bumps into Mendel Kravitz who
tells him that dressed in this way he looks like a rascal and that the
tax officer would immediately suspect something.</p><p><br></p><p>Moishe is very confused so he goes to visit Rabbi Nussbaum. The rabbi
is out, but his wife lets Moishe into the house.</p><p><br></p><p>“What is your trouble?” she asks. And Moishe tells her his story.</p><p><br></p><p>“Aha!” she replies at the end of the tale. “This reminds me of when I
was about to get married. I could not decide whether to wear a white
nightdress and look like a virgin, or a black one and look experienced
and seductive, so I asked my grandmother for advice.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oy!” cries Moishe. “And what did she say?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well,” says the rabbi’s wife, “she told me, ‘It doesn’t matter what
you wear – you’ll get fucked anyway.’”</p><p><br></p><p>Okay, Maneesha?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, Beloved Master.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part19>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

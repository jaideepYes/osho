‌DROPPING OUT OF THE LONELY HEARTS CLUB‌
A very intricate, complex thing has to be understood: If you are not in love, you are lonely. If you are in love, really in love, you become alone. Loneliness is sadness; aloneness is not sadness. Loneliness is a feeling of incompleteness. You need someone and the needed one is not available. Loneliness is darkness, with no light in it."><meta name=author content="Osho"><link rel=canonical href=https://osho.lol/posts/being_in_love/part12/><meta name=google-site-verification content="XYZabc"><meta name=yandex-verification content="XYZabc"><meta name=msvalidate.01 content="XYZabc"><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.b609c58d5c11bb90b1a54e04005d74ad1ddf22165eb79f5533967e57df9c3b50.css integrity="sha256-tgnFjVwRu5CxpU4EAF10rR3fIhZet59VM5Z+V9+cO1A=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=mask-icon href=https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://osho.lol/posts/being_in_love/part12/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:title" content="CHAPTER 7: DROPPING OUT OF THE LONELY HEARTS CLUB"><meta property="og:description" content="< Previous | Contents | Next >

If you are in love, really in love, you become alone. Loneliness is sadness; aloneness is not sadness. Loneliness is a feeling of incompleteness. You need someone and the needed one is not available. Loneliness is darkness, with no light in it. A dark house, waiting and waiting for someone to come and kindle the light.\nAloneness is not loneliness. Aloneness means the feeling that you are complete. Nobody is needed, you are enough. And this happens in love. Lovers become alone. Through love you touch your inner completeness. Love makes you complete. Lovers share each other, but that is not their need, that is their overflowing energy.\nTwo persons who have been feeling lonely can make a contract, can come together. They are not lovers, remember. They remain lonely but now, because of the presence of the other, they don’t feel the loneliness, that’s all. They somehow deceive themselves. Their love is nothing but a deception to deceive themselves: “I am not lonely, somebody else is there.”\nBecause two lonely persons are meeting, their loneliness basically is doubled, or even multiplied. That’s what happens ordinarily. You feel lonely when you are alone, and when you are in relationship you feel miserable. This is an everyday observation. When people are not in a relationship they feel lonely, and they are searching for somebody to be related to. When they are related to somebody, then the misery starts; then they feel it was better to be alone—this is too much.\nWhat happens? Two lonely people meet—that means two gloomy, sad, miserable people meet—and the misery is multiplied. How can two uglinesses become beautiful? How can two lonelinesses coming together bring a sense of\ncompletion, totality? Not possible. They exploit each other, they somehow try to deceive themselves through being related to each other, but that deception doesn’t go far. By the time the honeymoon is finished, the marriage is also finished. It is just a temporary illusion.\nReal love is not a search to combat loneliness. Real love is to transform loneliness into aloneness, to help the other. If you love a person, you help that person to be alone. You don’t try to fill him or her. You don’t try to complete the other in some way by your presence. You help the other to be alone, to be so full out of her or his own being that you will not be needed.\nWhen a person is totally free, then out of that freedom sharing is possible. Then he gives much, but not as a need; he gives much, but not as a bargain. He gives much because he has much. He gives because he enjoys giving.\nLovers are alone, and a real lover never destroys your aloneness. He will always be totally respectful toward your individuality, toward your aloneness. It is sacred. He will not interfere in it, he will not try to intrude on that space.\nBut ordinarily, lovers, so-called lovers, are very much afraid of the other’s aloneness, independence. They are very much afraid, because they think if the other is independent then they will not be needed, then they will be discarded. So the woman goes on trying to manage things so that her husband or boyfriend remains dependent. He should be always in need of her, so that she can remain valuable. And the man goes on trying in every way to manage the same, so that he remains valuable. The result is a bargain, not love, and there is continuous conflict, struggle. The struggle is based in the fact that everybody needs freedom.\nLove allows freedom; not only allows, but strengthens freedom. And anything that destroys freedom is not love. It must be something else. Love and freedom go together, they are two wings of the same bird. Whenever you see that your love is going against your freedom, then you are doing something else in the name of love.\nLet this be your criterion: freedom is the criterion; love gives you freedom, makes you free, liberates you. And once you are totally yourself, you feel grateful to the person who has helped you. That gratefulness is almost religious.\nYou feel in the other person something divine. He has made you free, she has made you free, and love has not become possessiveness.\nWhen love deteriorates it becomes possessiveness, jealousy, struggle for power, politics, domination, manipulation—a thousand and one things, all ugly. When love soars high, to the purest sky, it is freedom, total freedom.\nIf you are in love, the love I am talking about, your very love will help the other to be integrated. Your very love will become a cementing force for the other. In your love the other will come together as a whole, unique and individual, because your love will give freedom. Under the shade of your love, under the protection of your love, the other will start growing.\nAll growth needs love, but unconditional love. If love has conditions then growth cannot be total, because those conditions will come in the way.\nLove unconditionally, don’t ask anything in return. Much comes back to you on its own—that’s another thing—but don’t be a beggar. In love, be an emperor. Just give it and see what happens: a thousandfold it comes back. But one has to learn the knack. Otherwise one remains a miser; one gives a little and waits for something to come back, and that waiting and expectation destroys the whole beauty of it.\nWhen you are waiting and expecting, the other feels that you are being manipulative. He may say it or not, but he feels you are manipulating. And wherever you feel the other is trying to manipulate you, you want to rebel against it because it goes against the inner need of the soul, because any demand from the outside dis-integrates you. Any demand from the outside divides you. Any demand from the outside is a crime against you, because your freedom is polluted. Then you are no longer sacred. You are no longer the end, you are being used as a means. And the most immoral act in the world is to use somebody as a means.\nEach being is an end unto himself. Love treats you as an end unto yourself.\nYou are not to be dragged into any expectations.\nSo there are a few things to be remembered. One is to love, but not as a need\n—as a sharing. Love, but don’t expect; give. Love, but remember your love\nshould not become an imprisonment for the other. Love, but be very careful; you are moving on sacred ground. You are going into the highest, the purest and holiest temple. Be alert! Drop all impurities outside the temple. When you love a person, love the person as if the person is a god, not less than that. Never love a woman as a woman and never love a man as a man, because if you love a man as a man your love is going to be very ordinary. Your love is not going to be more than lust. If you love a woman as a woman, your love is not going to soar very high. Love a woman as a goddess, then love becomes worship.\nIn Tantra, the man who is going to make love to the woman has to worship her for months as a goddess. He has to visualize in the woman the mother-goddess. When the visualization has become total, when no lust arises, when seeing the woman sitting naked before him he simply feels thrilled with a divine energy and no lust arises, the very form of the woman becomes divine, and all thoughts stop and only reverence is felt—only then he is allowed to make love.\nIt looks a little absurd and paradoxical. When there is no need to make love, then he is allowed to make love. When the woman has become a goddess, then he is allowed to make love because now love can soar high, love can become a climax, a crescendo. Now it will not be of the earth, it will not be of this world; it will not be of two bodies, it will be of two beings. It will be a meeting of two existences. Two souls will meet, merge, and mingle, and both will come out of it tremendously alone.\nAloneness means purity. Aloneness means that you are just yourself and nobody else. Aloneness means that you are pure gold; just gold and nothing else, just you. Love makes you alone. Loneliness will disappear, but aloneness will arise.\nLoneliness is a state when you are ill with yourself, bored with yourself, tired of yourself, and you want to go somewhere and to forget yourself in being involved with somebody else. Aloneness is when you are thrilled just by your being. You are blissful just by being yourself. You need not go anywhere. Need has disappeared, you are enough unto yourself. But now, a new thing arises in your being. You have so much that you cannot contain it. You have to share, you have to give. And whoever accepts your gift, you will feel grateful that the person has accepted.\nLovers feel grateful that their love has been accepted. They feel thankful, because they were so full of energy and they needed someone to pour that energy into. When a flower blooms and releases its fragrance to the winds it feels grateful to the winds. The fragrance was growing more and more heavy on the flower, it was becoming almost a burden. It is just as if a woman is pregnant and nine months have passed and the child is not being born, is delaying. Now she is so burdened; she wants to share the child with the world.\nThat is the meaning of birth. Up to now the woman has been carrying the child within herself, it was nobody else’s but her own. But now it is too much; she cannot contain it. It has to be shared; the child has to be shared with the world. The mother has to drop her miserliness. Once the child is out of the womb, it is no longer only the mother’s; by and by the child will go away, and far away. It will become part of the great world.\nThe same happens when a cloud comes full of rainwater ready to shower, and when it showers, rains, the cloud feels unburdened and happy and grateful to the thirsty earth because it accepted the rain.\nThere are two types of love. One is the love that happens when you are feeling lonely: as a need, you go to the other. The other love arises when you are not feeling lonely, but alone. In the first case you go to get something; in the second case you go to give something. A giver is an emperor.\nLove that arises out of aloneness is not ordinary love. It has nothing to do with lust, on the contrary it is the greatest transformation of lust into love. And love makes you individual. If it doesn’t make you individual, if it tries to make you a slave, then it is not love; it is hate pretending love. Love of this type kills, destroys the individuality of the other. It makes you less of an individual, it pulls you down. You are not enhanced, you don’t become graceful. You are being pulled into the mud, and everybody who is tangled up in that kind of relationship starts feeling that he is settling with something dirty.\nLove should give you freedom; never settle for less. Love should make you completely free, a wanderer in the sky of freedom, with no roots attached anywhere. Love is not an attachment; lust is.\nMeditation and love are the two ways to attain to the individuality I am talking\nabout. Both are very deeply related. In fact they are both aspects of the same coin: love and meditation. If you meditate, sooner or later you will come upon love. If you meditate deeply, sooner or later you will start feeling a tremendous love arising in you that you have never known before: a new quality to your being, a new door opening. You have become a new flame and you want to share now.\nIf you love deeply, by and by you will become aware that your love is becoming more and more meditative. A subtle quality of silence is entering in you. Thoughts are disappearing, gaps appearing, silences. You are touching your own depth.\nLove makes you meditative if it is on the right lines. Meditation makes you loving if it is on the right lines.\nThe darkness of loneliness cannot be fought directly. It is something essential for everyone to understand, that there are a few fundamental things which cannot be changed. This is one of the fundamentals: you cannot fight with darkness directly, with loneliness directly, with the fear of isolation directly. The reason is that all these things do not exist; they are simply absences of something, just as darkness is the absence of light.\nYou can go on fighting with this darkness your whole life and you will not succeed, but just a small candle is enough to dispel it. You have to work for the light because it is positive, existential; it exists on its own. And once light comes, anything that was its absence automatically disappears.\nLoneliness is similar to darkness.\nYou don’t know your aloneness. You have not experienced your aloneness and its beauty, its tremendous power, its strength. Loneliness and aloneness in the dictionaries are synonymous, but existence does not follow your dictionaries. And nobody has yet tried to make an existential dictionary which will not be contradictory to existence.\nLoneliness is an absence, because you don’t know your aloneness. There is\nfear. You feel lonely so you want to cling to something, to somebody, to some relationship, just to hold on to the illusion that you are not lonely. But you know you are, hence the pain. On the one hand you are clinging to something that is not for real, which is just a temporary arrangement—a relationship, a friendship. And while you are in the relationship you can create a little illusion to forget your loneliness.\nBut this is the problem: although you can forget for a moment your loneliness, just the next moment you suddenly become aware that the relationship or the friendship is nothing permanent. Yesterday you did not know this man or this woman, you were strangers. Today you are friends; who knows about tomorrow? Tomorrow you may be strangers again, hence the pain.\nThe illusion gives a certain solace, but it cannot create the reality so that all fear disappears. It represses the fear, so on the surface you feel good—at least you try to feel good. You pretend to feel good to yourself: how wonderful is the relationship, how wonderful is the man or the woman. But behind the illusion— and the illusion is so thin that you can see behind it—there is pain in the heart, because the heart knows perfectly well that tomorrow things may not be the same, and they are not the same.\nYour whole life’s experience supports that things go on changing. Nothing remains stable; you cannot cling to anything in a changing world. You wanted to make your friendship something permanent but your wanting is against the law of change, and that law is not going to make exceptions. It simply goes on doing its own thing. It will change, everything will change. Perhaps in the long run you will understand one day that it was good that it did not listen to you, that existence did not bother about you and just went on doing whatever it wanted to do, not according to your desire.\nIt may take a little time for you to understand. You want this friend to be your friend forever, but tomorrow he turns into an enemy. Or simply, “You get lost!” and he is no longer with you. Somebody else fills the gap who is a far superior being. Then suddenly you realize it was good that the other one got lost; otherwise you would have been stuck with him. But still the lesson never goes so deep that you stop asking for permanence.\nYou will start asking for permanence with this man, with this woman: now\nthis should not change. You have not really learned the lesson that change is simply the very fabric of life. You have to understand it and go with it. Don’t create illusions; they are not going to help. And everybody is creating illusions of different kinds.\nI used to know one man who said, “I trust only money, nothing else.” I said, “You are making a very significant statement.”\nHe said, “Everybody changes. You cannot rely on anybody. And as you get older, only your money is yours. Nobody cares, not even your son, not even your wife. If you have money they all care, they all respect you because you have money. If you don’t have money you become a beggar.”\nHis saying that the only thing in the world to trust is money comes out of a long experience of life, of getting cheated again and again by the people he trusted. And he thought they loved him but they were all around him for the money.\n“But,” I told him, “at the moment of death money is not going to be with you. You can have an illusion that at least money is with you, but as your breathing stops, money is no longer with you. You have earned something but it will be left on this side; you cannot carry it beyond death. You will fall into a deep loneliness which you have been hiding behind the facade of money.”\nThere are people who are after power, but the reason is the same: when they are in power so many people are with them, millions of people are under their domination. They are not alone. They are great political and religious leaders. But power changes. One day you have it, another day it is gone, and suddenly the whole illusion disappears. You are lonely as nobody else is, because others are at least accustomed to being lonely. You are not accustomed, your loneliness hurts you more.\nSociety has tried to make arrangements so you can forget loneliness. Arranged marriages are just an effort so that you know your wife is with you. All religions resist divorce for the simple reason that if divorce is allowed then the basic purpose marriage was invented for is destroyed. The basic purpose was to give you a companion, a lifelong companion.\nBut even though a wife will be with you or a husband will be with you for your whole life, that does not mean that love remains the same. In fact, rather than giving you a companion, they give you a burden to carry. You were lonely, already in trouble, and now you have to carry another person who is lonely. And in this life there is no hope, because once love disappears you both are lonely, and both have to tolerate each other. Now it is not a question of being enchanted by each other; at the most you can patiently tolerate each other. Your loneliness has not been changed by the social strategy of marriage.\nReligions have tried to make you a member of an organized body of religion so you are always in a crowd. You know that there are millions of Catholics; you are not alone, millions of Catholics are with you. Jesus Christ is your savior. God is with you. Alone you may have been wrong, doubt may have arisen, but millions of people cannot be wrong. A little support, but even that is gone because there are millions who are not Catholics. There are the people who crucified Jesus, there are people who don’t believe in God. And their number is not less than Catholics, it is more. There are other religions with different concepts. It is difficult for an intelligent person not to doubt. You may have millions of people following a certain belief system, but still you cannot be certain that they are with you, that you are not lonely.\nGod was a device, but all devices have failed. It was a device…. when nothing else is there, at least God is with you. He is always everywhere with you. In the dark night of the soul, he is with you, so don’t be worried. It was good for a childish humanity to be deceived by this concept, but you cannot be deceived. This God who is always everywhere—you don’t see him, you can’t talk to him, you can’t touch him. You don’t have any evidence for his existence except your desire that he should be there. But your desire is not a proof of anything.\nGod is only a desire of the childish mind. Man has come of age, and God has become meaningless. The hypothesis has lost its grip.\nWhat I am trying to say is that every effort that has been directed toward avoiding loneliness has failed, and will fail, because it is against the fundamentals of life. What is needed is not something in which you can forget your loneliness. What is needed is that you become aware of your aloneness, which is a reality. And it is so beautiful to experience it, to feel it, because it is your freedom from the crowd, from the other. It is your freedom from the fear of\nbeing lonely.\nJust the word “lonely” immediately reminds you that it is like a wound: something is needed to fill it. There is a gap and it hurts, something needs to be put into that gap. The very word “aloneness” does not have the same sense of a wound, of a gap that has to be filled. Aloneness simply means completeness. You are whole; there is no need of anybody else to complete you.\nSo try to find your innermost center, where you are always alone, have always been alone. In life, in death, wherever you are you will be alone. But it is so full; it is not empty, it is so full and so complete and so overflowing with all the juices of life, with all the beauties and benedictions of existence that once you have tasted aloneness the pain in the heart will disappear. Instead, a new rhythm of tremendous sweetness, peace, joy, bliss, will be there.\nIt does not mean that a person who is centered in his aloneness, complete in himself, cannot make friends. In fact, only that person can make friends, because now it is no longer a need, it is just sharing. You have so much you can share.\nAnd when you share, there is no question of clinging. You flow with existence, you flow with life’s change, because it doesn’t matter with whom you share. It can be the same person tomorrow—the same person for your whole life\n—or it can be different persons. It is not a contract, it is not a marriage; it is simply out of your fullness that you want to give. So whoever happens to be near you, you give. And giving is such a joy.\nBegging is such a misery. Even if you get something through begging, you will remain miserable. It hurts. It hurts your pride, it hurts your integrity. But sharing makes you more centered, more integrated, more proud—but not more egoistic, simply proud that existence has been compassionate to you. It is not ego; it is a totally different phenomenon, a recognition that existence has allowed you something for which millions of people are trying but at the wrong door. You happen to be at the right door.\nYou are proud of your blissfulness and all that existence has given to you. Fear disappears, darkness disappears, the pain disappears, the desire for the other disappears. You can love a person, and if the person loves somebody else there will not be any jealousy, because you loved out of so much joy. It was not a\nclinging, you were not holding the other person in prison. You were not worried that the other person may slip out of your hands, that somebody else may start having a love affair. When you are sharing your joy, you don’t create a prison for anybody. You simply give. You don’t even expect gratitude or thankfulness because you are not giving to get anything, not even gratitude. You are giving because you are so full you have to give.\nSo I will not tell you to do anything about your loneliness. Look for your aloneness. Forget loneliness, forget darkness, forget pain. These are just the absence of aloneness, and the experience of aloneness will dispel them instantly. And the method is the same: just watch your mind, be aware. Become more and more conscious, so finally you are only conscious of yourself. That is the point where you become aware of aloneness.\nAnd always look to see if anything that you are facing as a problem is a negative thing or a positive thing. If it is a negative thing then don’t fight with it; don’t bother about it at all. Just look for the positive of it, and you will be at the right door. Most of the people in the world miss because they start fighting directly with the negative door. There is no door; there is only darkness, there is only absence. And the more they fight the more they find failure, the more they become dejected, pessimistic, and ultimately they decide that life has no meaning, that it is simply torture. Their mistake is that they entered from the wrong door.\nSo before you face a problem, just look at it—is it an absence of something? And the truth is that all your problems are the absence of something. Once you have found what they are the absence of, then go after the positive. The moment you find the positive you have found the light, and the darkness is finished.\nWhy is it I feel fully alive only when I am in love? I tell myself that I should be able to spark myself without the other, but so far no luck. Is this some stupid Waiting for Godot game I am playing with myself? When the last love affair ended I swore to myself I was not going to let the same old deadening process happen, but here I am again feeling half alive, waiting for “him” to come. One remains in need of the other up to that point, up to that experience, when\none enters into one’s own innermost core. Unless one knows oneself one remains in the need of the other. But the need of the other is very paradoxical; its nature is paradoxical. When you are alone you feel lonely, you feel the other is missed; your life seems to be only half. It loses joy, it loses flow, flowering; it remains undernourished. If you are with the other, then a new problem arises because the other starts encroaching on your space. He starts imposing conditions upon you, he starts demanding things from you, he starts destroying your freedom, and that hurts.\nSo when you are with somebody, only for a few days when the honeymoon is still there, and the more intelligent you are, the shorter will be the honeymoon, remember. Only for utterly dull people it can be a long affair; for insensitive people it can be a lifelong thing. But if you are intelligent, sensitive, soon you will realize what you have done. The other is destroying your freedom, and suddenly you become aware that you need your freedom because freedom is of immense value. And you decide never again to bother with the other.\nAgain when you are alone you are free, but something is missing, because your aloneness is not true aloneness; it is only loneliness, it is a negative state. You forget all about freedom. Free you are, but what to do with this freedom? Love is not there, and both are essential needs.\nAnd up to now humanity has lived in such an insane way that you can fulfill only one need: either you can be free, but then you have to drop the idea of love. That’s what monks and nuns of all the religions have been doing: drop the idea of love, you are free; there is nobody to hinder you, there is nobody to interfere with you, nobody to make any demands, nobody to possess you. But then their life becomes cold, almost dead.\nYou can go to any monastery and look at the monks and the nuns: their life is ugly. It stinks of death; it is not fragrant with life. There is no dance, no joy, no song. All songs have disappeared, all joy is dead. They are paralyzed—how can they dance? They are crippled—how can they dance? There is nothing to dance about. Their energies are stuck, they are no longer flowing. For the flow the other is needed; without the other there is no flow.\nSo the majority of humanity has decided for love and dropped the idea of freedom. But then people are living like slaves. Man has reduced the woman into\na thing, a commodity, and of course the woman has done the same in her own subtle way: she has made all the husbands henpecked.\nI have heard:\nIn New York a few henpecked husbands joined hands together. They made a club to protest, to fight—Men’s Liberation Movement, or something like that! And of course they chose one of the most henpecked husbands the president of the club.\nThe first meeting happened, but the president never turned up. They were all worried. They rushed to his home and they asked him, “What is the matter? Have you forgotten?”\nHe said, “No, but my wife won’t allow me. She says, ‘You go out, and I will never allow you back in!’ And that much risk I cannot take.”\nThe man has reduced the woman to a slave and the woman has reduced the man to a slave. And of course both hate the slavery, both resist it. They are constantly fighting; any small excuse and the fight starts.\nBut the real fight is somewhere else deep down; the real fight is that they are asking for freedom. They cannot say it so clearly, they may have forgotten completely. For thousands of years this is the way people have lived. They have seen their fathers and mothers living in the same way, they have seen their grandparents living in the same way. This is the way people live; they have accepted it, and their freedom is destroyed.\nIt is as if we are trying to fly in the sky with one wing. A few people have the wing of love and a few people have the wing of freedom, but both are incapable of flying. Both the wings are needed.\nYou are asking, “Why is it I feel fully alive only when I am in love?” It is perfectly natural; there is nothing wrong in it. It is how it should be. Love is a natural need; it is like food. If you are hungry, of course you will feel a deep unease. Without love your soul is hungry; love is a soul nourishment. Just as the body needs food, water, air, the soul needs love. But the soul also needs freedom, and it is one of the strangest things that we have not accepted this fact yet.\nIf you love there is no need to destroy your freedom. They both can exist\ntogether; there is no antagonism between them. It is because of our foolishness that we have created the antagonism. Hence, the monks think the worldly people are fools, and the worldly people deep down know that the monks are fools; they are missing all the joys of life.\nA great priest was asked, “What is love?”\nThe priest said, “A word made up of two vowels, two consonants, and two fools!”\nThat is their condemnation of love. Because all the religions have condemned love, they have praised freedom very much. In India we call the ultimate experience moksha; moksha means absolute freedom.\nYou say: “I tell myself that I should be able to spark myself without the other, but so far no luck.” It will remain so, it will not change. You should rather change your conditioning about love and freedom. Love the person, but give the person total freedom. Love the person, but from the very beginning make it clear that you are not selling your freedom.\nAnd if you cannot make it happen in this community, here with me, you cannot make it happen anywhere else. Here we are experimenting with many things, and one of the dimensions of our experiment is to make love and freedom possible together, to support their coexistence together. Love a person but don’t possess, and don’t be possessed. Insist for freedom, and don’t lose love! There is no need. There is no natural enmity between freedom and love; it is a created enmity. Of course for centuries it has been so, so you have become accustomed to it; it has become a conditioned thing.\nAn old farmer down South could barely speak above a whisper. Leaning on a fence by the side of a country road he was watching a dozen razorbacks in a patch of woodland. Every few minutes the hogs would scramble through a hole in the fence, tear across the road to another patch of woodland, and immediately afterward scurry back again.\n“What’s the matter with them hogs anyway?” a passing stranger asked.\n“There ain’t nothing the matter with them,” the old farmer whispered\nhoarsely. “Them hogs belongs to me and before I lost my voice I used to call them to their feed. After I lost my voice I used to tap on this fence rail with my stick at feeding time.”\nHe paused and shook his head gravely. “And now,” he added, “them cussed woodpeckers up in them trees has got them poor hogs plumb crazy!”\nJust conditioning! That’s what is happening to humanity.\nOne of the disciples of Pavlov, the pioneer and developer of the theory of the conditioned reflex, was trying an experiment along the same lines. He bought a puppy and decided to condition him to stand up and bark for his food. He held the pup’s food just out of reach, barked a few times, then set it on the floor before him. The idea was that the pup would associate standing up and barking with getting his food and learn to do so when hungry.\nThis went on for about a week, but the little dog failed to learn. After another week the man gave up the experiment and simply put the food down in front of the dog, but the pup refused to eat it. He was waiting for his master to stand and bark! Now he had become conditioned.\nIt is only a conditioning, it can be dropped. You just need a little meditativeness. Meditation simply means the process of unconditioning the mind. Whatever the society has done to you has to be undone. When you are unconditioned you will be able to see the beauty of love and freedom together; they are two aspects of the same coin. If you really love the person you will give him or her absolute freedom—that’s a gift of love. And when there is freedom, love responds tremendously. When you give freedom to somebody you have given the greatest gift, and love comes rushing towards you.\nYou ask me: “Is this some stupid Waiting for Godot game I am playing with myself?” No.\n“When the last love affair ended, I swore to myself I was not going to let the same old deadening process happen, but here I am again feeling half alive, waiting for ‘him’ to come.” But just by making a vow, just by deciding, you cannot change yourself. You have to understand. Love is a basic need, as basic as freedom, so both have to be fulfilled. And a person who is full of love and\nfree is the most beautiful phenomenon in the world. And when two persons of such beauty meet, their relationship is not a relationship at all. It is a relating. It is a constant, riverlike flow. It is continuously growing towards greater heights.\nThe ultimate height of love and freedom is the experience of the divine. In it you will find both tremendous love, absolute love, and absolute freedom.\nI am always afraid of being alone, because when I am alone I start to wonder who I am. It feels that if I inquire deeper, I will find out that I am not the person who I have believed I was for the past twenty-six years, but a being, present at the moment of birth and maybe also the moment before. For some reason, this scares me completely. It feels like a kind of insanity, and makes me lose myself in outside things in order to feel safer. Who am I, and why the fear? It is not only your fear, it is everybody’s fear. Because nobody is what he was supposed to be by existence.\nThe society, the culture, the religion, the education have all been conspiring against innocent children. They have all the powers, the child is helpless and dependent. So whatsoever they want to make out of him, they manage to do it. They don’t allow any child to grow to his natural destiny. Their every effort is to make human beings into utilities.\nWho knows, if a child is left on his own to grow, whether he will be of any use to the vested interests or not? The society is not prepared to take the risk. It grabs the child and starts molding him into something that is needed by the society. In a certain sense, it kills the soul of the child and gives him a false identity, so that he never misses his soul, his being.\nThe false identity is a substitute. But that substitute is useful only in the same crowd which has given it to you. The moment you are alone, the false starts falling apart and the repressed real starts expressing itself.\nHence the fear of being lonely. Nobody wants to be lonely, everybody wants to belong to a crowd—not only one crowd, but many crowds. A person belongs to a religious crowd, a political party, a rotary club, and there are many other\nsmall groups to belong to. One wants to be supported twenty-four hours a day because the false, without support, cannot stand. The moment one is alone, one starts feeling a strange craziness.\nThat’s what you have been asking about because for twenty-six years you believed yourself to be somebody, and then suddenly in a moment of being alone you start feeling you are not that. It creates fear; then who are you? And twenty- six years of suppression—it will take some time for the real to express itself. The gap between the two has been called by the mystics “the dark night of the soul”—a very appropriate expression. You are no more the false, and you are not yet the real. You are in a limbo, you don’t know who you are.\nParticularly in the West—and the questioner comes from the West—the problem is even more complicated. Because they have not developed any methodology to discover the real as soon as possible, so that the dark night of the soul can be shortened. The West knows nothing as far as meditation is concerned. And meditation is only a name for being alone, silent, waiting for the real to assert itself. It is not an act, it is a silent relaxation because whatever you do will come out of your false personality. All your doing for twenty-six years has come out of it; it is an old habit.\nHabits die hard.\nThere was one great mystic in India, Eknath. He was going for a holy pilgrimage with all his disciples. It was almost three to six months’ journey.\nOne man came to him, fell at his feet, and said, “I know I am not worthy. You know it too, everybody knows me. But I know your compassion is greater than my unworthiness. Please accept me also as one of the members of the group that is going on the holy pilgrimage.”\nEknath said, “You are a thief, and not an ordinary thief, but a master thief. You have never been caught, and everybody knows that you are a thief. I certainly feel like taking you with me, but I also have to think about those fifty other people who are going with me. You will have to give me a promise—and I am not asking for more, just for these three to six months’ time while we are on the pilgrimage: you will not steal. After that, it is up to you. Once we are back home, you are free from the promise.”\nThe man said, “I am absolutely ready to promise, and I am tremendously grateful for your compassion.”\nThe other fifty people were suspicious. To trust in a thief…, but they could not say anything to Eknath, he was the master.\nThe pilgrimage started, and from the very first night there was trouble. The next morning there was chaos: somebody’s coat was missing, somebody’s shirt was missing, somebody’s money was gone. And everybody was shouting, “Where is my money?” and they were all telling Eknath, “We were worried from the very beginning that you were taking this man with you. A lifelong habit—.”\nBut then they started looking, and they found that things were not stolen. Somebody’s money was missing, but it was found in somebody else’s bag. Somebody else’s coat was missing, but it was found in somebody else’s luggage. Everything was found, but it was an unnecessary trouble—every morning! And nobody could conceive what can be the meaning of it? Certainly it is not the thief, because nothing was actually stolen.\nThe third night, Eknath remained awake to see what was going on. In the middle of the night, the thief—just out of habit—woke up, started taking things from one place to another place. Eknath stopped him and said, “What are you doing? Have you forgotten your promise?”\nHe said, “No, I have not forgotten my promise. I am not stealing anything, but I have not promised that I will not move things from one place to another place. After six months I have to be a thief again; this is just practice. And you must understand, it is a lifelong habit, you cannot drop it just like that. Just give me time. You should understand my problem also. For three days I have not stolen a single thing—it is just like fasting! This is just a substitute, I am keeping myself busy. This is my business time, in the middle of the night, so it is very hard for me just to lie down on the bed awake. And so many idiots are sleeping and I am not doing any harm to anybody. In the morning they will find their things.”\nEknath said, “You are a strange man. You see that every morning there is such chaos, and one or two hours unnecessarily are wasted in finding where you have put things, whose property has gone into whose luggage. Everybody has to open everything and ask everybody…‘To whom does this belong?’”\nThe thief said, “This much concession you have to give to me.”\nTwenty-six years of a false personality imposed by people who you loved, whom you respected, and they were not intentionally doing anything bad to you. Their intentions were good, just their awareness was nil. They were not conscious people: your parents, your teachers, your priests, your politicians were not conscious people, they were unconscious. And even a good intention in the hands of an unconscious person turns out to be poisonous.\nSo whenever you are alone, a deep fear arises because suddenly the false starts disappearing. And the real will take a little time. You have lost it twenty-six years back. You will have to give some consideration to the fact that a gap of twenty-six years has to be bridged.\nIn fear that “I am losing myself, my senses, my sanity, my mind, everything,” because the self that has been given to you by others consists of all these things\n—it looks like you will go insane. You immediately start doing something just to keep yourself engaged. If there are no people, at least there is some action. So the false remains engaged and does not start disappearing.\nHence, people find it the most difficult on holidays. For five days they work, hoping that on the weekend they are going to relax. But the weekend is the worst time in the whole world. More accidents happen on the weekend, more people commit suicide, more murders, more stealing, more rape. Strange, these people were engaged for five days and there was no problem. But the weekend suddenly gives them a choice, either to be engaged in something or to relax, but relaxing is fearsome; the false personality disappears. Keep engaged, do anything stupid.\nPeople are running toward the beaches, bumper to bumper, miles-long traffic. And if you ask them where they are going, they are “getting away from the crowd” and the whole crowd is going with them! They are going to find a solitary, silent space—all of them. In fact, if they had remained home it would have been more solitary and silent, because all the idiots have gone in search of a solitary place. And they are rushing like mad, because two days will be finished soon, they have to reach don’t ask where! And on the beaches, you can see. Not even marketplaces are so crowded. Strangely enough, people are feeling very much at ease, taking a sunbath. Ten thousand people on a small beach taking a sunbath, relaxing.\nThe same person on the same beach alone will not be able to relax. But he knows thousands of other people are relaxing all around him. The same people were in the offices, the same people were in the streets, the same people were in the marketplace, now these people are on the beach.\nThe crowd is an essential for the false self to exist. The moment it is lonely, you start freaking out. This is where one should understand a little bit of meditation.\nDon’t be worried, because that which can disappear is worth disappearing. It is meaningless to cling to it—it is not yours, it is not you. You are the one when the false has gone and the fresh, the innocent, the unpolluted being will arise in its place.\nNobody else can answer your question “Who am I?”—you will know it.\nAll meditative techniques are a help to destroy the false. They don’t give you the real—the real cannot be given. That which can be given cannot be real. The real you have got already; just the false has to be taken away.\nMeditation is just a courage to be silent and alone. Slowly, you start feeling a new quality to yourself, a new aliveness, a new beauty, a new intelligence, which is not borrowed from anybody, which is growing within you. It has roots in your existence. And if you are not a coward, it will come to fruition, to flowering.\nOnly the brave, the courageous, the people who have guts can be religious. Not the churchgoers: these are the cowards. Not the Hindus, not the Mohammedans, not the Christians: they are against searching. It is the same crowd, and they are trying to make their false identity more consolidated.\nYou were born. You have come into the world with life, with consciousness, with tremendous sensitivity. Just look at a small child. Look at his eyes, the freshness. All that has been covered by a false personality.\nThere is no need to be afraid. You can lose only that which needs to be lost. And it is good to lose it soon, because the longer it stays, the stronger it becomes, and one does not know anything about tomorrow. Don’t die before realizing your authentic being. Only those few people are fortunate who have\nlived with authentic being and who have died with authentic being because they know that life is eternal, and death is a fiction.\nThen move out of it! One should always be watchful, because if one is not feeling happy in any situation, in any mood, then one should come out of it. Otherwise that becomes your habit, and by and by you lose sensitivity. You will go on being miserable and living in it, which simply shows a very deep insensitivity.\nThere is no need! If you are not feeling good in isolation, then come out of it. Meet with people, enjoy company, talk and laugh, but when you feel you are fed up with it, move into isolation again.\nAlways remember to judge everything by your inner feeling of bliss. If you are feeling blissful, everything is all right. If you are not feeling blissful, then whatsoever you are doing, something somewhere is wrong. The longer you remain in it, the more it becomes just an unaware thing, and you completely forget that it is through your cooperation that the miserable feeling continues. It needs your cooperation; it cannot exist itself.\nHuman growth requires that one moves from one polarity to another. Sometimes being alone is perfectly good: one needs one’s own space, one needs to forget the whole world, and to be oneself. The other is absent so you have no boundary to yourself. The other creates your boundary, otherwise you are infinite.\nLiving with people, moving in the world, in society, by and by one begins to feel confined, limited, as if there are walls all around. It becomes a subtle imprisonment, and one needs to move. One needs sometimes to be perfectly alone so that all boundaries disappear, as if the other does not exist at all, and the whole universe and the whole sky exists only for you. In that moment of aloneness one realizes for the first time what infinity is.\nBut then if you live in it too much, by and by the infinity bores you, it becomes tasteless. There is purity and silence, but there is no ecstasy in it. Ecstasy always comes through the other. One then starts feeling hungry for love, and wants to escape from this aloneness, this vast expanse of space. One wants a cozy place surrounded by others, so that one can forget oneself.\nThis is the basic polarity of life, love and meditation. People who try to live through love and relationships alone, by and by become very limited. They lose infinity and purity, and they become superficial. Always living in relationships means always living on the boundary where you can meet the other. So you are always standing at the gate, and you can never move into your palace, because only at the gate is the meeting-point where the other passes by. So people who only live in love, by and by become superficial. Their life loses depth. And people who live only in meditation will become very deep, but their life loses color, loses the ecstatic dance, the orgasmic quality of being.\nReal humanity, the humanity of the future, will live with both the polarities together, and to share that understanding is my whole effort. One should be free to move from one to another, with neither polarity becoming a confinement. You should not be afraid of the marketplace, nor too afraid of the monastery. You should be free to move from the marketplace to the monastery, and from the monastery to the marketplace.\nThis freedom, this flexibility of movement, I call sannyas. The bigger the swing, the richer your life. There are attractions to remaining with just one of the polarities because then life is simpler. If you just remain with people, in the crowd, it is simple. Complexity comes with the contradictory, the opposite pole. If you become a monk or you go to the Himalayas and just live there, life is very simple. But a simple life which has no complexity in it loses much richness.\nLife should be both complex and simple. One has to seek this harmony continuously; otherwise life becomes of one note, a single note. You can go on repeating it, but no orchestra can be created out of it.\nSo whenever you feel that something is now becoming troublesome, immediately move before you become unaware. Never make anywhere your home, neither relationships nor aloneness. Remain flowing and homeless, and don’t abide at any polarity. Enjoy it, delight in it, but when it is finished move to the other: make it a rhythm.\nYou work in the day, by night you rest, so that again by the next day you are ready to work, energy regained. Just think of a man who goes on working all day and all night, or who goes on sleeping day and night—what kind of a life will that be? One will be a madness, the other a coma. Between the two there is a\nbalance, a harmony. Work hard so that you can relax. Relax deeply so that you become capable of working, of being more creative.\nPlease help me! My boyfriend has been in Goa for five weeks and I’ve had such a good time enjoying the freedom and independence, no need to face my jealousy and possessiveness, just floating through the day. Now it looks as if he is coming back soon and I’m getting nervous already, wondering what he is doing, how it is going to be, if he found somebody else, et cetera. What is this attachment to a particular person which creates all these comfortable and very uncomfortable feelings? I’m not really a meditative type, but is there any possibility to go beyond this attachment of the heart and feel free, or is the only way to live it, go through it, and suffer and enjoy the whole thing? I know your boyfriend: he will make anybody happy if he goes to Goa and remains there forever! He is a challenge, so if you are becoming nervous, it is natural. And don’t be worried about his getting involved with any girl, because no girl will get involved with him.\nI have thought about him and I think that only you can manage him. He’s a crackpot but you love him. You cannot love a simple human being. You are born for each other: neither can you find another boyfriend nor can he find another girlfriend. So don’t be worried about possessiveness or anything. You can be absolutely non-possessive, still he will be your boyfriend. Where else can he go? You are in a good, secured, guaranteed, insured condition.\nIn the first place, it is a miracle that you have found him. When I heard about it for the first time I said, “My God! Now something mysterious is going to happen. These two people together are going to create so much trouble.” But still, he’s attached to you, you are attached to him. Mostly your love is fighting, and when you are tired of fighting you love also, but that is only when you are both tired. He will also be feeling nervous, because he has to come back. I had suggested to him that he go away for a few weeks. He left immediately, the very moment he received my message: “Go to Goa.” He did not wait even a single day! He must have enjoyed those five weeks the same way you have enjoyed\nthem. Now you are feeling nervous, and he will be feeling nervous because those weeks will finally come to an end.\nBut deep down you are also feeling happy that he is coming back, and the same will be his situation. Let him come. He’s just your old boyfriend: you know him every bit, he knows you every bit. All the fights are well known, all the problems are well known. There is no need to feel nervous because there is not going to be anything new. It is just the same old chap, so let him come back and start life again in the same old way.\nIt is something to be understood: the girlfriend you get or the boyfriend you get, you deserve. You don’t get any boyfriend or girlfriend whom you don’t deserve; those kinds of relationships only last for one or two days. But your relationship has a history and it is going to last to the very end, so relax and take it easily!\nYou deserve him, he deserves you. And once you see the point that you deserve each other there is no question of any grudge, any complaining, any grumbling. You are strong enough, because that crackpot has not been able to make even a dent in you. He has been doing all kinds of neurotic things. But he does not know that you are a psychotic, and neurotics and psychotics make good marriages. They fit perfectly.\nOne psychoanalyst was asked—because those two words look so similar, and the difference is known only to the experts—the psychoanalyst was asked, “What is the difference between neurosis and psychosis?”\nHe said, “The psychotic thinks two plus two are five and, whatever you do, he never changes his mind. He’s determined and committed to his viewpoint. The neurotic knows that two plus two are four but feels very nervous—why are they four?”\nPerfect marriages happen only in heaven, but once in a while on the earth too. You and your boyfriend are a perfect combination. So let the poor fellow come, start hammering each other in the old way. You are accustomed and well trained, he is accustomed and well trained. One feels worried about a new girlfriend; one never knows what she is going to do—freak out in the middle of the night? One is nervous about the new boyfriend, because one cannot predict what kind of\nman he’s going to prove to be.\nYou are certain. In this certainty you should relax and let him come. I don’t see that there is any problem. You are both perfectly happy in your misery; all people are perfectly happy in their miserable relationships! That’s why after a five weeks’ separation you feel good. If the separation is for a longer time you will start missing him.\nI have given just enough time so that you can enjoy freedom and he can enjoy freedom, and in the right moment, when you start missing each other, he’s back. Just wait!\nAnd he’s not a dangerous person; he cannot harm you. He’s very good at heart, just a little loose in his head. But to have a boyfriend who is a little loose in the head is better than to have a boyfriend who is a little tight in the head. I know it is no ordinary relationship: you both are extraordinary.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"10011","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/being_in_love/part12/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/being_in_love/>Being in Love</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">CHAPTER 7: DROPPING OUT OF THE LONELY HEARTS CLUB</h1><div class=post-meta>47 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;10011 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Being_in_Love/part12.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part11>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

<span class=p>very intricate, complex thing has to be understood: If
you are not in love, you are lonely. If you are in love, really in love,
you become alone.</span></h3><p>Loneliness is sadness; aloneness is not sadness. Loneliness is a
feeling of incompleteness. You need someone and the needed one is not
available. Loneliness is darkness, with no light in it. A dark house,
waiting and waiting for someone to come and kindle the light.</p><p>Aloneness is not loneliness. Aloneness means the feeling that you are
complete. Nobody is needed, you are enough. And this happens in love.
Lovers become alone. Through love you touch your inner completeness.
Love makes you complete. Lovers share each other, but that is not their
need, that is their overflowing energy.</p><p>Two persons who have been feeling lonely can make a contract, can
come together. They are not lovers, remember. They remain lonely but
now, because of the presence of the other, they don’t feel the
loneliness, that’s all. They somehow deceive themselves. Their love is
nothing but a deception to deceive themselves: “I am not lonely,
somebody else is there.”</p><p>Because two lonely persons are meeting, their loneliness basically is
doubled, or even multiplied. That’s what happens ordinarily. You feel
lonely when you are alone, and when you are in relationship you feel
miserable. This is an everyday observation. When people are not in a
relationship they feel lonely, and they are searching for somebody to be
related to. When they are related to somebody, then the misery starts;
then they feel it was better to be alone—this is too much.</p><p>What happens? Two lonely people meet—that means two gloomy, sad,
miserable people meet—and the misery is multiplied. How can two
uglinesses become beautiful? How can two lonelinesses coming together
bring a sense of</p><p>completion, totality? Not possible. They exploit each other, they
somehow try to deceive themselves through being related to each other,
but that deception doesn’t go far. By the time the honeymoon is
finished, the marriage is also finished. It is just a temporary
illusion.</p><p>Real love is not a search to combat loneliness. Real love is to
transform loneliness into aloneness, to help the other. If you love a
person, you help that person to be alone. You don’t try to fill him or
her. You don’t try to complete the other in some way by your presence.
You help the other to be alone, to be so full out of her or his own
being that you will not be needed.</p><p>When a person is totally free, then out of that freedom sharing is
possible. Then he gives much, but not as a need; he gives much, but not
as a bargain. He gives much because he has much. He gives because he
enjoys giving.</p><p>Lovers are alone, and a real lover never destroys your aloneness. He
will always be totally respectful toward your individuality, toward your
aloneness. It is sacred. He will not interfere in it, he will not try to
intrude on that space.</p><p>But ordinarily, lovers, so-called lovers, are very much afraid of the
other’s aloneness, independence. They are very much afraid, because they
think if the other is independent then they will not be needed, then
they will be discarded. So the woman goes on trying to manage things so
that her husband or boyfriend remains dependent. He should be always in
need of her, so that she can remain valuable. And the man goes on trying
in every way to manage the same, so that he remains valuable. The result
is a bargain, not love, and there is continuous conflict, struggle. The
struggle is based in the fact that everybody needs freedom.</p><p>Love allows freedom; not only allows, but strengthens freedom. And
anything that destroys freedom is not love. It must be something else.
Love and freedom go together, they are two wings of the same bird.
Whenever you see that your love is going against your freedom, then you
are doing something else in the name of love.</p><p>Let this be your criterion: freedom is the criterion; love gives you
freedom, makes you free, liberates you. And once you are totally
yourself, you feel grateful to the person who has helped you. That
gratefulness is almost religious.</p><p>You feel in the other person something divine. He has made you free,
she has made you free, and love has not become possessiveness.</p><p>When love deteriorates it becomes possessiveness, jealousy, struggle
for power, politics, domination, manipulation—a thousand and one things,
all ugly. When love soars high, to the purest sky, it is freedom, total
freedom.</p><p>If you are in love, the love I am talking about, your very love will
help the other to be integrated. Your very love will become a cementing
force for the other. In your love the other will come together as a
whole, unique and individual, because your love will give freedom. Under
the shade of your love, under the protection of your love, the other
will start growing.</p><p>All growth needs love, but <em>unconditional</em> love. If love has
conditions then growth cannot be total, because those conditions will
come in the way.</p><p>Love unconditionally, don’t ask anything in return. Much comes back
to you on its own—that’s another thing—but don’t be a beggar. In love,
be an emperor. Just give it and see what happens: a thousandfold it
comes back. But one has to learn the knack. Otherwise one remains a
miser; one gives a little and waits for something to come back, and that
waiting and expectation destroys the whole beauty of it.</p><p>When you are waiting and expecting, the other feels that you are
being manipulative. He may say it or not, but he feels you are
manipulating. And wherever you feel the other is trying to manipulate
you, you want to rebel against it because it goes against the inner need
of the soul, because any demand from the outside dis-integrates you. Any
demand from the outside divides you. Any demand from the outside is a
crime against you, because your freedom is polluted. Then you are no
longer sacred. You are no longer the end, you are being used as a means.
And the most immoral act in the world is to use somebody as a means.</p><p>Each being is an end unto himself. Love treats you as an end unto
yourself.</p><p>You are not to be dragged into any expectations.</p><p>So there are a few things to be remembered. One is to love, but not
as a need</p><p>—as a sharing. Love, but don’t expect; give. Love, but remember your
love</p><p>should not become an imprisonment for the other. Love, but be very
careful; you are moving on sacred ground. You are going into the
highest, the purest and holiest temple. Be alert! Drop all impurities
outside the temple. When you love a person, love the person as if the
person is a god, not less than that. Never love a woman as a woman and
never love a man as a man, because if you love a man as a man your love
is going to be very ordinary. Your love is not going to be more than
lust. If you love a woman as a woman, your love is not going to soar
very high. Love a woman as a goddess, then love becomes worship.</p><p>In Tantra, the man who is going to make love to the woman has to
worship her for months as a goddess. He has to visualize in the woman
the mother-goddess. When the visualization has become total, when no
lust arises, when seeing the woman sitting naked before him he simply
feels thrilled with a divine energy and no lust arises, the very form of
the woman becomes divine, and all thoughts stop and only reverence is
felt—only then he is allowed to make love.</p><p>It looks a little absurd and paradoxical. When there is no need to
make love, then he is allowed to make love. When the woman has become a
goddess, then he is allowed to make love because now love can soar high,
love can become a climax, a crescendo. Now it will not be of the earth,
it will not be of this world; it will not be of two bodies, it will be
of two beings. It will be a meeting of two existences. Two souls will
meet, merge, and mingle, and both will come out of it tremendously
alone.</p><p>Aloneness means purity. Aloneness means that you are just yourself
and nobody else. Aloneness means that you are pure gold; just gold and
nothing else, just you. Love makes you alone. Loneliness will disappear,
but aloneness will arise.</p><p>Loneliness is a state when you are ill with yourself, bored with
yourself, tired of yourself, and you want to go somewhere and to forget
yourself in being involved with somebody else. Aloneness is when you are
thrilled just by your being. You are blissful just by being yourself.
You need not go anywhere. Need has disappeared, you are enough unto
yourself. But now, a new thing arises in your being. You have so much
that you cannot contain it. You have to share, you have to give. And
whoever accepts your gift, you will feel grateful that the person has
accepted.</p><p>Lovers feel grateful that their love has been accepted. They feel
thankful, because they were so full of energy and they needed someone to
pour that energy into. When a flower blooms and releases its fragrance
to the winds it feels grateful to the winds. The fragrance was growing
more and more heavy on the flower, it was becoming almost a burden. It
is just as if a woman is pregnant and nine months have passed and the
child is not being born, is delaying. Now she is so burdened; she wants
to share the child with the world.</p><p>That is the meaning of birth. Up to now the woman has been carrying
the child within herself, it was nobody else’s but her own. But now it
is too much; she cannot contain it. It has to be shared; the child has
to be shared with the world. The mother has to drop her miserliness.
Once the child is out of the womb, it is no longer only the mother’s; by
and by the child will go away, and far away. It will become part of the
great world.</p><p>The same happens when a cloud comes full of rainwater ready to
shower, and when it showers, rains, the cloud feels unburdened and happy
and grateful to the thirsty earth because it accepted the rain.</p><p>There are two types of love. One is the love that happens when you
are feeling lonely: as a need, you go to the other. The other love
arises when you are not feeling lonely, but alone. In the first case you
go to get something; in the second case you go to give something. A
giver is an emperor.</p><p>Love that arises out of aloneness is not ordinary love. It has
nothing to do with lust, on the contrary it is the greatest
transformation of lust into love. And love makes you individual. If it
doesn’t make you individual, if it tries to make you a slave, then it is
not love; it is hate pretending love. Love of this type kills, destroys
the individuality of the other. It makes you less of an individual, it
pulls you down. You are not enhanced, you don’t become graceful. You are
being pulled into the mud, and everybody who is tangled up in that kind
of relationship starts feeling that he is settling with something
dirty.</p><p>Love should give you freedom; never settle for less. Love should make
you completely free, a wanderer in the sky of freedom, with no roots
attached anywhere. Love is not an attachment; lust is.</p><p>Meditation and love are the two ways to attain to the individuality I
am talking</p><p>about. Both are very deeply related. In fact they are both aspects of
the same coin: love and meditation. If you meditate, sooner or later you
will come upon love. If you meditate deeply, sooner or later you will
start feeling a tremendous love arising in you that you have never known
before: a new quality to your being, a new door opening. You have become
a new flame and you want to share now.</p><p>If you love deeply, by and by you will become aware that your love is
becoming more and more meditative. A subtle quality of silence is
entering in you. Thoughts are disappearing, gaps appearing, silences.
You are touching your own depth.</p><p>Love makes you meditative if it is on the right lines. Meditation
makes you loving if it is on the right lines.</p><p><br></p><p>The darkness of loneliness cannot be fought directly. It is something
essential for everyone to understand, that there are a few fundamental
things which cannot be changed. This is one of the fundamentals: you
cannot fight with darkness directly, with loneliness directly, with the
fear of isolation directly. The reason is that all these things do not
exist; they are simply absences of something, just as darkness is the
absence of light.</p><p>You can go on fighting with this darkness your whole life and you
will not succeed, but just a small candle is enough to dispel it. You
have to work for the light because it is positive, existential; it
exists on its own. And once light comes, anything that was its absence
automatically disappears.</p><p>Loneliness is similar to darkness.</p><p>You don’t know your aloneness. You have not experienced your
aloneness and its beauty, its tremendous power, its strength. Loneliness
and aloneness in the dictionaries are synonymous, but existence does not
follow your dictionaries. And nobody has yet tried to make an
existential dictionary which will not be contradictory to existence.</p><p>Loneliness is an absence, because you don’t know your aloneness.
There is</p><p>fear. You feel lonely so you want to cling to something, to somebody,
to some relationship, just to hold on to the illusion that you are not
lonely. But you know you are, hence the pain. On the one hand you are
clinging to something that is not for real, which is just a temporary
arrangement—a relationship, a friendship. And while you are in the
relationship you can create a little illusion to forget your
loneliness.</p><p>But this is the problem: although you can forget for a moment your
loneliness, just the next moment you suddenly become aware that the
relationship or the friendship is nothing permanent. Yesterday you did
not know this man or this woman, you were strangers. Today you are
friends; who knows about tomorrow? Tomorrow you may be strangers again,
hence the pain.</p><p>The illusion gives a certain solace, but it cannot create the reality
so that all fear disappears. It represses the fear, so on the surface
you feel good—at least you try to feel good. You pretend to feel good to
yourself: how wonderful is the relationship, how wonderful is the man or
the woman. But behind the illusion— and the illusion is so thin that you
can see behind it—there is pain in the heart, because the heart knows
perfectly well that tomorrow things may not be the same, and they are
not the same.</p><p>Your whole life’s experience supports that things go on changing.
Nothing remains stable; you cannot cling to anything in a changing
world. You wanted to make your friendship something permanent but your
wanting is against the law of change, and that law is not going to make
exceptions. It simply goes on doing its own thing. It will change,
everything will change. Perhaps in the long run you will understand one
day that it was good that it did not listen to you, that existence did
not bother about you and just went on doing whatever it wanted to do,
not according to your desire.</p><p>It may take a little time for you to understand. You want this friend
to be your friend forever, but tomorrow he turns into an enemy. Or
simply, “You get lost!” and he is no longer with you. Somebody else
fills the gap who is a far superior being. Then suddenly you realize it
was good that the other one got lost; otherwise you would have been
stuck with him. But still the lesson never goes so deep that you stop
asking for permanence.</p><p>You will start asking for permanence with this man, with this woman:
now</p><p>this should not change. You have not really learned the lesson that
change is simply the very fabric of life. You have to understand it and
go with it. Don’t create illusions; they are not going to help. And
everybody is creating illusions of different kinds.</p><p>I used to know one man who said, “I trust only money, nothing else.”
I said, “You are making a very significant statement.”</p><p>He said, “Everybody changes. You cannot rely on anybody. And as you
get older, only your money is yours. Nobody cares, not even your son,
not even your wife. If you have money they all care, they all respect
you because you have money. If you don’t have money you become a
beggar.”</p><p>His saying that the only thing in the world to trust is money comes
out of a long experience of life, of getting cheated again and again by
the people he trusted. And he thought they loved him but they were all
around him for the money.</p><p>“But,” I told him, “at the moment of death money is not going to be
with you. You can have an illusion that at least money is with you, but
as your breathing stops, money is no longer with you. You have earned
something but it will be left on this side; you cannot carry it beyond
death. You will fall into a deep loneliness which you have been hiding
behind the facade of money.”</p><p>There are people who are after power, but the reason is the same:
when they are in power so many people are with them, millions of people
are under their domination. They are not alone. They are great political
and religious leaders. But power changes. One day you have it, another
day it is gone, and suddenly the whole illusion disappears. You are
lonely as nobody else is, because others are at least accustomed to
being lonely. You are not accustomed, your loneliness hurts you
more.</p><p>Society has tried to make arrangements so you can forget loneliness.
Arranged marriages are just an effort so that you know your wife is with
you. All religions resist divorce for the simple reason that if divorce
is allowed then the basic purpose marriage was invented for is
destroyed. The basic purpose was to give you a companion, a lifelong
companion.</p><p>But even though a wife will be with you or a husband will be with you
for your whole life, that does not mean that love remains the same. In
fact, rather than giving you a companion, they give you a burden to
carry. You were lonely, already in trouble, and now you have to carry
another person who is lonely. And in this life there is no hope, because
once love disappears you both are lonely, and both have to tolerate each
other. Now it is not a question of being enchanted by each other; at the
most you can patiently tolerate each other. Your loneliness has not been
changed by the social strategy of marriage.</p><p>Religions have tried to make you a member of an organized body of
religion so you are always in a crowd. You know that there are millions
of Catholics; you are not alone, millions of Catholics are with you.
Jesus Christ is your savior. God is with you. Alone you may have been
wrong, doubt may have arisen, but millions of people cannot be wrong. A
little support, but even that is gone because there are millions who are
not Catholics. There are the people who crucified Jesus, there are
people who don’t believe in God. And their number is not less than
Catholics, it is more. There are other religions with different
concepts. It is difficult for an intelligent person not to doubt. You
may have millions of people following a certain belief system, but still
you cannot be certain that they are with you, that you are not
lonely.</p><p>God was a device, but all devices have failed. It was a device…. when
nothing else is there, at least God is with you. He is always everywhere
with you. In the dark night of the soul, he is with you, so don’t be
worried. It was good for a childish humanity to be deceived by this
concept, but you cannot be deceived. This God who is always
everywhere—you don’t see him, you can’t talk to him, you can’t touch
him. You don’t have any evidence for his existence except your desire
that he should be there. But your desire is not a proof of anything.</p><p>God is only a desire of the childish mind. Man has come of age, and
God has become meaningless. The hypothesis has lost its grip.</p><p>What I am trying to say is that every effort that has been directed
toward avoiding loneliness has failed, and will fail, because it is
against the fundamentals of life. What is needed is not something in
which you can forget your loneliness. What is needed is that you become
aware of your aloneness, which is a reality. And it is so beautiful to
experience it, to feel it, because it is your freedom from the crowd,
from the other. It is your freedom from the fear of</p><p>being lonely.</p><p>Just the word “lonely” immediately reminds you that it is like a
wound: something is needed to fill it. There is a gap and it hurts,
something needs to be put into that gap. The very word “aloneness” does
not have the same sense of a wound, of a gap that has to be filled.
Aloneness simply means completeness. You are whole; there is no need of
anybody else to complete you.</p><p>So try to find your innermost center, where you are always alone,
have always been alone. In life, in death, wherever you are you will be
alone. But it is so full; it is not empty, it is so full and so complete
and so overflowing with all the juices of life, with all the beauties
and benedictions of existence that once you have tasted aloneness the
pain in the heart will disappear. Instead, a new rhythm of tremendous
sweetness, peace, joy, bliss, will be there.</p><p>It does not mean that a person who is centered in his aloneness,
complete in himself, cannot make friends. In fact, only that person can
make friends, because now it is no longer a need, it is just sharing.
You have so much you can share.</p><p>And when you share, there is no question of clinging. You flow with
existence, you flow with life’s change, because it doesn’t matter with
whom you share. It can be the same person tomorrow—the same person for
your whole life</p><p>—or it can be different persons. It is not a contract, it is not a
marriage; it is simply out of your fullness that you want to give. So
whoever happens to be near you, you give. And giving is such a joy.</p><p>Begging is such a misery. Even if you get something through begging,
you will remain miserable. It hurts. It hurts your pride, it hurts your
integrity. But sharing makes you more centered, more integrated, more
proud—but not more egoistic, simply proud that existence has been
compassionate to you. It is not ego; it is a totally different
phenomenon, a recognition that existence has allowed you something for
which millions of people are trying but at the wrong door. You happen to
be at the right door.</p><p>You are proud of your blissfulness and all that existence has given
to you. Fear disappears, darkness disappears, the pain disappears, the
desire for the other disappears. You can love a person, and if the
person loves somebody else there will not be any jealousy, because you
loved out of so much joy. It was not a</p><p>clinging, you were not holding the other person in prison. You were
not worried that the other person may slip out of your hands, that
somebody else may start having a love affair. When you are sharing your
joy, you don’t create a prison for anybody. You simply give. You don’t
even expect gratitude or thankfulness because you are not giving to get
anything, not even gratitude. You are giving because you are so full you
have to give.</p><p>So I will not tell you to do anything about your loneliness. Look for
your aloneness. Forget loneliness, forget darkness, forget pain. These
are just the absence of aloneness, and the experience of aloneness will
dispel them instantly. And the method is the same: just watch your mind,
be aware. Become more and more conscious, so finally you are only
conscious of yourself. That is the point where you become aware of
aloneness.</p><p>And always look to see if anything that you are facing as a problem
is a negative thing or a positive thing. If it is a negative thing then
don’t fight with it; don’t bother about it at all. Just look for the
positive of it, and you will be at the right door. Most of the people in
the world miss because they start fighting directly with the negative
door. There is no door; there is only darkness, there is only absence.
And the more they fight the more they find failure, the more they become
dejected, pessimistic, and ultimately they decide that life has no
meaning, that it is simply torture. Their mistake is that they entered
from the wrong door.</p><p>So before you face a problem, just look at it—is it an absence of
something? And the truth is that all your problems are the absence of
something. Once you have found what they are the absence of, then go
after the positive. The moment you find the positive you have found the
light, and the darkness is finished.</p><p><br></p><h4 style=padding-left:33pt;text-indent:1pt;line-height:107%;text-align:justify id=why-is-it-i-feel-fully-alive-only-when-i-am-in-love-i-tell-myself-that-i-should-be-able-to-spark-myself-without-the-other-but-so-far-no-luck.-is-this-some-stupid-waiting-for-godot-game-i-am-playing-with-myself-when-the-last-love-affair-ended-i-swore-to-myself-i-was-not-going-to-let-the-same-old-deadening-process-happen-but-here-i-am-again-feeling-half-alive-waiting-for-him-to-come.>Why
is it I feel fully alive only when I am in love? I tell myself that I
should be able to spark myself without the other, but so far no luck. Is
this some stupid <em>Waiting for Godot</em> game I am playing with
myself? When the last love affair ended I swore to myself I was not
going to let the same old deadening process happen, but here I am again
feeling half alive, waiting for “him” to come.</h4><p>One remains in need of the other up to that point, up to that
experience, when</p><p>one enters into one’s own innermost core. Unless one knows oneself
one remains in the need of the other. But the need of the other is very
paradoxical; its nature is paradoxical. When you are alone you feel
lonely, you feel the other is missed; your life seems to be only half.
It loses joy, it loses flow, flowering; it remains undernourished. If
you are with the other, then a new problem arises because the other
starts encroaching on your space. He starts imposing conditions upon
you, he starts demanding things from you, he starts destroying your
freedom, and that hurts.</p><p>So when you are with somebody, only for a few days when the honeymoon
is still there, and the more intelligent you are, the shorter will be
the honeymoon, remember. Only for utterly dull people it can be a long
affair; for insensitive people it can be a lifelong thing. But if you
are intelligent, sensitive, soon you will realize what you have done.
The other is destroying your freedom, and suddenly you become aware that
you need your freedom because freedom is of immense value. And you
decide never again to bother with the other.</p><p>Again when you are alone you are free, but something is missing,
because your aloneness is not true aloneness; it is only loneliness, it
is a negative state. You forget all about freedom. Free you are, but
what to do with this freedom? Love is not there, and both are essential
needs.</p><p>And up to now humanity has lived in such an insane way that you can
fulfill only one need: either you can be free, but then you have to drop
the idea of love. That’s what monks and nuns of all the religions have
been doing: drop the idea of love, you are free; there is nobody to
hinder you, there is nobody to interfere with you, nobody to make any
demands, nobody to possess you. But then their life becomes cold, almost
dead.</p><p>You can go to any monastery and look at the monks and the nuns: their
life is ugly. It stinks of death; it is not fragrant with life. There is
no dance, no joy, no song. All songs have disappeared, all joy is dead.
They are paralyzed—how can they dance? They are crippled—how can they
dance? There is nothing to dance about. Their energies are stuck, they
are no longer flowing. For the flow the other is needed; without the
other there is no flow.</p><p>So the majority of humanity has decided for love and dropped the idea
of freedom. But then people are living like slaves. Man has reduced the
woman into</p><p>a thing, a commodity, and of course the woman has done the same in
her own subtle way: she has made all the husbands henpecked.</p><p>I have heard:</p><p>In New York a few henpecked husbands joined hands together. They made
a club to protest, to fight—Men’s Liberation Movement, or something like
that! And of course they chose one of the most henpecked husbands the
president of the club.</p><p>The first meeting happened, but the president never turned up. They
were all worried. They rushed to his home and they asked him, “What is
the matter? Have you forgotten?”</p><p>He said, “No, but my wife won’t allow me. She says, ‘You go out, and
I will never allow you back in!’ And that much risk I cannot take.”</p><p>The man has reduced the woman to a slave and the woman has reduced
the man to a slave. And of course both hate the slavery, both resist it.
They are constantly fighting; any small excuse and the fight starts.</p><p>But the real fight is somewhere else deep down; the real fight is
that they are asking for freedom. They cannot say it so clearly, they
may have forgotten completely. For thousands of years this is the way
people have lived. They have seen their fathers and mothers living in
the same way, they have seen their grandparents living in the same way.
This is the way people live; they have accepted it, and their freedom is
destroyed.</p><p>It is as if we are trying to fly in the sky with one wing. A few
people have the wing of love and a few people have the wing of freedom,
but both are incapable of flying. Both the wings are needed.</p><p>You are asking, “Why is it I feel fully alive only when I am in
love?” It is perfectly natural; there is nothing wrong in it. It is how
it should be. Love is a natural need; it is like food. If you are
hungry, of course you will feel a deep unease. Without love your soul is
hungry; love is a soul nourishment. Just as the body needs food, water,
air, the soul needs love. But the soul also needs freedom, and it is one
of the strangest things that we have not accepted this fact yet.</p><p>If you love there is no need to destroy your freedom. They both can
exist</p><p>together; there is no antagonism between them. It is because of our
foolishness that we have created the antagonism. Hence, the monks think
the worldly people are fools, and the worldly people deep down know that
the monks are fools; they are missing all the joys of life.</p><p>A great priest was asked, “What is love?”</p><p>The priest said, “A word made up of two vowels, two consonants, and
two fools!”</p><p>That is their condemnation of love. Because all the religions have
condemned love, they have praised freedom very much. In India we call
the ultimate experience <em>moksha; moksha</em> means absolute
freedom.</p><p>You say: “I tell myself that I should be able to spark myself without
the other, but so far no luck.” It will remain so, it will not change.
You should rather change your conditioning about love and freedom. Love
the person, but give the person total freedom. Love the person, but from
the very beginning make it clear that you are not selling your
freedom.</p><p>And if you cannot make it happen in this community, here with me, you
cannot make it happen anywhere else. Here we are experimenting with many
things, and one of the dimensions of our experiment is to make love and
freedom possible together, to support their coexistence together. Love a
person but don’t possess, and don’t be possessed. Insist for freedom,
and don’t lose love! There is no need. There is no natural enmity
between freedom and love; it is a created enmity. Of course for
centuries it has been so, so you have become accustomed to it; it has
become a conditioned thing.</p><p>An old farmer down South could barely speak above a whisper. Leaning
on a fence by the side of a country road he was watching a dozen
razorbacks in a patch of woodland. Every few minutes the hogs would
scramble through a hole in the fence, tear across the road to another
patch of woodland, and immediately afterward scurry back again.</p><p>“What’s the matter with them hogs anyway?” a passing stranger
asked.</p><p>“There ain’t nothing the matter with them,” the old farmer
whispered</p><p>hoarsely. “Them hogs belongs to me and before I lost my voice I used
to call them to their feed. After I lost my voice I used to tap on this
fence rail with my stick at feeding time.”</p><p>He paused and shook his head gravely. “And now,” he added, “them
cussed woodpeckers up in them trees has got them poor hogs plumb
crazy!”</p><p>Just conditioning! That’s what is happening to humanity.</p><p>One of the disciples of Pavlov, the pioneer and developer of the
theory of the conditioned reflex, was trying an experiment along the
same lines. He bought a puppy and decided to condition him to stand up
and bark for his food. He held the pup’s food just out of reach, barked
a few times, then set it on the floor before him. The idea was that the
pup would associate standing up and barking with getting his food and
learn to do so when hungry.</p><p>This went on for about a week, but the little dog failed to learn.
After another week the man gave up the experiment and simply put the
food down in front of the dog, but the pup refused to eat it. He was
waiting for his master to stand and bark! Now he had become
conditioned.</p><p>It is only a conditioning, it can be dropped. You just need a little
meditativeness. Meditation simply means the process of unconditioning
the mind. Whatever the society has done to you has to be undone. When
you are unconditioned you will be able to see the beauty of love and
freedom together; they are two aspects of the same coin. If you really
love the person you will give him or her absolute freedom—that’s a gift
of love. And when there is freedom, love responds tremendously. When you
give freedom to somebody you have given the greatest gift, and love
comes rushing towards you.</p><p>You ask me: “Is this some stupid <em>Waiting for Godot</em> game I am
playing with myself?” No.</p><p>“When the last love affair ended, I swore to myself I was not going
to let the same old deadening process happen, but here I am again
feeling half alive, waiting for ‘him’ to come.” But just by making a
vow, just by deciding, you cannot change yourself. You have to
understand. Love is a basic need, as basic as freedom, so both have to
be fulfilled. And a person who is full of love <em>and</em></p><p>free is the most beautiful phenomenon in the world. And when two
persons of such beauty meet, their relationship is not a relationship at
all. It is a relating. It is a constant, riverlike flow. It is
continuously growing towards greater heights.</p><p>The ultimate height of love and freedom is the experience of the
divine. In it you will find both tremendous love, absolute love, and
absolute freedom.</p><p><br></p><h4 style=padding-left:33pt;text-indent:1pt;line-height:107%;text-align:justify id=i-am-always-afraid-of-being-alone-because-when-i-am-alone-i-start-to-wonder-who-i-am.-it-feels-that-if-i-inquire-deeper-i-will-find-out-that-i-am-not-the-person-who-i-have-believed-i-was-for-the-past-twenty-six-years-but-a-being-present-at-the-moment-of-birth-and-maybe-also-the-moment-before.-for-some-reason-this-scares-me-completely.-it-feels-like-a-kind-of-insanity-and-makes-me-lose-myself-in-outside-things-in-order-to-feel-safer.-who-am-i-and-why-the-fear>I
am always afraid of being alone, because when I am alone I start to
wonder who I am. It feels that if I inquire deeper, I will find out that
I am not the person who I have believed I was for the past twenty-six
years, but a being, present at the moment of birth and maybe also the
moment before. For some reason, this scares me completely. It feels like
a kind of insanity, and makes me lose myself in outside things in order
to feel safer. Who am I, and why the fear?</h4><p>It is not only your fear, it is everybody’s fear. Because nobody is
what he was supposed to be by existence.</p><p>The society, the culture, the religion, the education have all been
conspiring against innocent children. They have all the powers, the
child is helpless and dependent. So whatsoever they want to make out of
him, they manage to do it. They don’t allow any child to grow to his
natural destiny. Their every effort is to make human beings into
utilities.</p><p>Who knows, if a child is left on his own to grow, whether he will be
of any use to the vested interests or not? The society is not prepared
to take the risk. It grabs the child and starts molding him into
something that is needed by the society. In a certain sense, it kills
the soul of the child and gives him a false identity, so that he never
misses his soul, his being.</p><p>The false identity is a substitute. But that substitute is useful
only in the same crowd which has given it to you. The moment you are
alone, the false starts falling apart and the repressed real starts
expressing itself.</p><p>Hence the fear of being lonely. Nobody wants to be lonely, everybody
wants to belong to a crowd—not only one crowd, but many crowds. A person
belongs to a religious crowd, a political party, a rotary club, and
there are many other</p><p>small groups to belong to. One wants to be supported twenty-four
hours a day because the false, without support, cannot stand. The moment
one is alone, one starts feeling a strange craziness.</p><p>That’s what you have been asking about because for twenty-six years
you believed yourself to be somebody, and then suddenly in a moment of
being alone you start feeling you are not that. It creates fear; then
who are you? And twenty- six years of suppression—it will take some time
for the real to express itself. The gap between the two has been called
by the mystics “the dark night of the soul”—a very appropriate
expression. You are no more the false, and you are not yet the real. You
are in a limbo, you don’t know who you are.</p><p>Particularly in the West—and the questioner comes from the West—the
problem is even more complicated. Because they have not developed any
methodology to discover the real as soon as possible, so that the dark
night of the soul can be shortened. The West knows nothing as far as
meditation is concerned. And meditation is only a name for being alone,
silent, waiting for the real to assert itself. It is not an act, it is a
silent relaxation because whatever you do will come out of your false
personality. All your doing for twenty-six years has come out of it; it
is an old habit.</p><p>Habits die hard.</p><p>There was one great mystic in India, Eknath. He was going for a holy
pilgrimage with all his disciples. It was almost three to six months’
journey.</p><p>One man came to him, fell at his feet, and said, “I know I am not
worthy. You know it too, everybody knows me. But I know your compassion
is greater than my unworthiness. Please accept me also as one of the
members of the group that is going on the holy pilgrimage.”</p><p>Eknath said, “You are a thief, and not an ordinary thief, but a
master thief. You have never been caught, and everybody knows that you
are a thief. I certainly feel like taking you with me, but I also have
to think about those fifty other people who are going with me. You will
have to give me a promise—and I am not asking for more, just for these
three to six months’ time while we are on the pilgrimage: you will not
steal. After that, it is up to you. Once we are back home, you are free
from the promise.”</p><p>The man said, “I am absolutely ready to promise, and I am
tremendously grateful for your compassion.”</p><p>The other fifty people were suspicious. To trust in a thief…, but
they could not say anything to Eknath, he was the master.</p><p>The pilgrimage started, and from the very first night there was
trouble. The next morning there was chaos: somebody’s coat was missing,
somebody’s shirt was missing, somebody’s money was gone. And everybody
was shouting, “Where is my money?” and they were all telling Eknath, “We
were worried from the very beginning that you were taking this man with
you. A lifelong habit—.”</p><p>But then they started looking, and they found that things were not
stolen. Somebody’s money was missing, but it was found in somebody
else’s bag. Somebody else’s coat was missing, but it was found in
somebody else’s luggage. Everything was found, but it was an unnecessary
trouble—every morning! And nobody could conceive what can be the meaning
of it? Certainly it is not the thief, because nothing was actually
stolen.</p><p>The third night, Eknath remained awake to see what was going on. In
the middle of the night, the thief—just out of habit—woke up, started
taking things from one place to another place. Eknath stopped him and
said, “What are you doing? Have you forgotten your promise?”</p><p>He said, “No, I have not forgotten my promise. I am not stealing
anything, but I have not promised that I will not move things from one
place to another place. After six months I have to be a thief again;
this is just practice. And you must understand, it is a lifelong habit,
you cannot drop it just like that. Just give me time. You should
understand my problem also. For three days I have not stolen a single
thing—it is just like fasting! This is just a substitute, I am keeping
myself busy. This is my business time, in the middle of the night, so it
is very hard for me just to lie down on the bed awake. And so many
idiots are sleeping and I am not doing any harm to anybody. In the
morning they will find their things.”</p><p>Eknath said, “You are a strange man. You see that every morning there
is such chaos, and one or two hours unnecessarily are wasted in finding
where you have put things, whose property has gone into whose luggage.
Everybody has to open everything and ask everybody…‘To whom does this
belong?’”</p><p>The thief said, “This much concession you have to give to me.”</p><p>Twenty-six years of a false personality imposed by people who you
loved, whom you respected, and they were not intentionally doing
anything bad to you. Their intentions were good, just their awareness
was nil. They were not conscious people: your parents, your teachers,
your priests, your politicians were not conscious people, they were
unconscious. And even a good intention in the hands of an unconscious
person turns out to be poisonous.</p><p>So whenever you are alone, a deep fear arises because suddenly the
false starts disappearing. And the real will take a little time. You
have lost it twenty-six years back. You will have to give some
consideration to the fact that a gap of twenty-six years has to be
bridged.</p><p>In fear that “I am losing myself, my senses, my sanity, my mind,
everything,” because the self that has been given to you by others
consists of all these things</p><p>—it looks like you will go insane. You immediately start doing
something just to keep yourself engaged. If there are no people, at
least there is some action. So the false remains engaged and does not
start disappearing.</p><p>Hence, people find it the most difficult on holidays. For five days
they work, hoping that on the weekend they are going to relax. But the
weekend is the worst time in the whole world. More accidents happen on
the weekend, more people commit suicide, more murders, more stealing,
more rape. Strange, these people were engaged for five days and there
was no problem. But the weekend suddenly gives them a choice, either to
be engaged in something or to relax, but relaxing is fearsome; the false
personality disappears. Keep engaged, do anything stupid.</p><p>People are running toward the beaches, bumper to bumper, miles-long
traffic. And if you ask them where they are going, they are “getting
away from the crowd” and the whole crowd is going with them! They are
going to find a solitary, silent space—all of them. In fact, if they had
remained home it would have been more solitary and silent, because all
the idiots have gone in search of a solitary place. And they are rushing
like mad, because two days will be finished soon, they have to reach
don’t ask where! And on the beaches, you can see. Not even marketplaces
are so crowded. Strangely enough, people are feeling very much at ease,
taking a sunbath. Ten thousand people on a small beach taking a sunbath,
relaxing.</p><p>The same person on the same beach alone will not be able to relax.
But he knows thousands of other people are relaxing all around him. The
same people were in the offices, the same people were in the streets,
the same people were in the marketplace, now these people are on the
beach.</p><p>The crowd is an essential for the false self to exist. The moment it
is lonely, you start freaking out. This is where one should understand a
little bit of meditation.</p><p>Don’t be worried, because that which can disappear is worth
disappearing. It is meaningless to cling to it—it is not yours, it is
not you. You are the one when the false has gone and the fresh, the
innocent, the unpolluted being will arise in its place.</p><p>Nobody else can answer your question “Who am I?”—you will know
it.</p><p>All meditative techniques are a help to destroy the false. They don’t
give you the real—the real cannot be given. That which can be given
cannot be real. The real you have got already; just the false has to be
taken away.</p><p>Meditation is just a courage to be silent and alone. Slowly, you
start feeling a new quality to yourself, a new aliveness, a new beauty,
a new intelligence, which is not borrowed from anybody, which is growing
within you. It has roots in your existence. And if you are not a coward,
it will come to fruition, to flowering.</p><p>Only the brave, the courageous, the people who have guts can be
religious. Not the churchgoers: these are the cowards. Not the Hindus,
not the Mohammedans, not the Christians: they are against searching. It
is the same crowd, and they are trying to make their false identity more
consolidated.</p><p>You were born. You have come into the world with life, with
consciousness, with tremendous sensitivity. Just look at a small child.
Look at his eyes, the freshness. All that has been covered by a false
personality.</p><p>There is no need to be afraid. You can lose only that which needs to
be lost. And it is good to lose it soon, because the longer it stays,
the stronger it becomes, and one does not know anything about tomorrow.
Don’t die before realizing your authentic being. Only those few people
are fortunate who have</p><p>lived with authentic being and who have died with authentic being
because they know that life is eternal, and death is a fiction.</p><p>Then move out of it! One should always be watchful, because if one is
not feeling happy in any situation, in any mood, then one should come
out of it. Otherwise that becomes your habit, and by and by you lose
sensitivity. You will go on being miserable and living in it, which
simply shows a very deep insensitivity.</p><p>There is no need! If you are not feeling good in isolation, then come
out of it. Meet with people, enjoy company, talk and laugh, but when you
feel you are fed up with it, move into isolation again.</p><p>Always remember to judge everything by your inner feeling of bliss.
If you are feeling blissful, everything is all right. If you are not
feeling blissful, then whatsoever you are doing, something somewhere is
wrong. The longer you remain in it, the more it becomes just an unaware
thing, and you completely forget that it is through your cooperation
that the miserable feeling continues. It needs your cooperation; it
cannot exist itself.</p><p>Human growth requires that one moves from one polarity to another.
Sometimes being alone is perfectly good: one needs one’s own space, one
needs to forget the whole world, and to be oneself. The other is absent
so you have no boundary to yourself. The other creates your boundary,
otherwise you are infinite.</p><p>Living with people, moving in the world, in society, by and by one
begins to feel confined, limited, as if there are walls all around. It
becomes a subtle imprisonment, and one needs to move. One needs
sometimes to be perfectly alone so that all boundaries disappear, as if
the other does not exist at all, and the whole universe and the whole
sky exists only for you. In that moment of aloneness one realizes for
the first time what infinity is.</p><p>But then if you live in it too much, by and by the infinity bores
you, it becomes tasteless. There is purity and silence, but there is no
ecstasy in it. Ecstasy always comes through the other. One then starts
feeling hungry for love, and wants to escape from this aloneness, this
vast expanse of space. One wants a cozy place surrounded by others, so
that one can forget oneself.</p><p>This is the basic polarity of life, love and meditation. People who
try to live through love and relationships alone, by and by become very
limited. They lose infinity and purity, and they become superficial.
Always living in relationships means always living on the boundary where
you can meet the other. So you are always standing at the gate, and you
can never move into your palace, because only at the gate is the
meeting-point where the other passes by. So people who only live in
love, by and by become superficial. Their life loses depth. And people
who live only in meditation will become very deep, but their life loses
color, loses the ecstatic dance, the orgasmic quality of being.</p><p>Real humanity, the humanity of the future, will live with both the
polarities together, and to share that understanding is my whole effort.
One should be free to move from one to another, with neither polarity
becoming a confinement. You should not be afraid of the marketplace, nor
too afraid of the monastery. You should be free to move from the
marketplace to the monastery, and from the monastery to the
marketplace.</p><p>This freedom, this flexibility of movement, I call <em>sannyas.</em>
The bigger the swing, the richer your life. There are attractions to
remaining with just one of the polarities because then life is simpler.
If you just remain with people, in the crowd, it is simple. Complexity
comes with the contradictory, the opposite pole. If you become a monk or
you go to the Himalayas and just live there, life is very simple. But a
simple life which has no complexity in it loses much richness.</p><p>Life should be both complex and simple. One has to seek this harmony
continuously; otherwise life becomes of one note, a single note. You can
go on repeating it, but no orchestra can be created out of it.</p><p>So whenever you feel that something is now becoming troublesome,
immediately move before you become unaware. Never make anywhere your
home, neither relationships nor aloneness. Remain flowing and homeless,
and don’t abide at any polarity. Enjoy it, delight in it, but when it is
finished move to the other: make it a rhythm.</p><p>You work in the day, by night you rest, so that again by the next day
you are ready to work, energy regained. Just think of a man who goes on
working all day and all night, or who goes on sleeping day and
night—what kind of a life will that be? One will be a madness, the other
a coma. Between the two there is a</p><p>balance, a harmony. Work hard so that you can relax. Relax deeply so
that you become capable of working, of being more creative.</p><p><br></p><h4 style=padding-left:33pt;text-indent:1pt;line-height:107%;text-align:justify id=please-help-me-my-boyfriend-has-been-in-goa-for-five-weeks-and-ive-had-such-a-good-time-enjoying-the-freedom-and-independence-no-need-to-face-my-jealousy-and-possessiveness-just-floating-through-the-day.-now-it-looks-as-if-he-is-coming-back-soon-and-im-getting-nervous-already-wondering-what-he-is-doing-how-it-is-going-to-be-if-he-found-somebody-else-et-cetera.-what-is-this-attachment-to-a-particular-person-which-creates-all-these-comfortable-and-very-uncomfortable-feelings-im-not-really-a-meditative-type-but-is-there-any-possibility-to-go-beyond-this-attachment-of-the-heart-and-feel-free-or-is-the-only-way-to-live-it-go-through-it-and-suffer-and-enjoy-the-whole-thing>Please
help me! My boyfriend has been in Goa for five weeks and I’ve had such a
good time enjoying the freedom and independence, no need to face my
jealousy and possessiveness, just floating through the day. Now it looks
as if he is coming back soon and I’m getting nervous already, wondering
what he is doing, how it is going to be, if he found somebody else, et
cetera. What is this attachment to a particular person which creates all
these comfortable and very uncomfortable feelings? I’m not really a
meditative type, but is there any possibility to go beyond this
attachment of the heart and feel free, or is the only way to live it, go
through it, and suffer and enjoy the whole thing?</h4><p>I know your boyfriend: he will make anybody happy if he goes to Goa
and remains there forever! He is a challenge, so if you are becoming
nervous, it is natural. And don’t be worried about his getting involved
with any girl, because no girl will get involved with him.</p><p>I have thought about him and I think that only you can manage him.
He’s a crackpot but you love him. You cannot love a simple human being.
You are born for each other: neither can you find another boyfriend nor
can he find another girlfriend. So don’t be worried about possessiveness
or anything. You can be absolutely non-possessive, still he will be your
boyfriend. Where else can he go? You are in a good, secured, guaranteed,
insured condition.</p><p>In the first place, it is a miracle that you have found him. When I
heard about it for the first time I said, “My God! Now something
mysterious is going to happen. These two people together are going to
create so much trouble.” But still, he’s attached to you, you are
attached to him. Mostly your love is fighting, and when you are tired of
fighting you love also, but that is only when you are both tired. He
will also be feeling nervous, because he has to come back. I had
suggested to him that he go away for a few weeks. He left immediately,
the very moment he received my message: “Go to Goa.” He did not wait
even a single day! He must have enjoyed those five weeks the same way
you have enjoyed</p><p>them. Now you are feeling nervous, and he will be feeling nervous
because those weeks will finally come to an end.</p><p>But deep down you are also feeling happy that he is coming back, and
the same will be his situation. Let him come. He’s just your old
boyfriend: you know him every bit, he knows you every bit. All the
fights are well known, all the problems are well known. There is no need
to feel nervous because there is not going to be anything new. It is
just the same old chap, so let him come back and start life again in the
same old way.</p><p>It is something to be understood: the girlfriend you get or the
boyfriend you get, you deserve. You don’t get any boyfriend or
girlfriend whom you don’t deserve; those kinds of relationships only
last for one or two days. But your relationship has a history and it is
going to last to the very end, so relax and take it easily!</p><p>You deserve him, he deserves you. And once you see the point that you
deserve each other there is no question of any grudge, any complaining,
any grumbling. You are strong enough, because that crackpot has not been
able to make even a dent in you. He has been doing all kinds of neurotic
things. But he does not know that you are a psychotic, and neurotics and
psychotics make good marriages. They fit perfectly.</p><p>One psychoanalyst was asked—because those two words look so similar,
and the difference is known only to the experts—the psychoanalyst was
asked, “What is the difference between neurosis and psychosis?”</p><p>He said, “The psychotic thinks two plus two are five and, whatever
you do, he never changes his mind. He’s determined and committed to his
viewpoint. The neurotic knows that two plus two are four but feels very
nervous—why are they four?”</p><p>Perfect marriages happen only in heaven, but once in a while on the
earth too. You and your boyfriend are a perfect combination. So let the
poor fellow come, start hammering each other in the old way. You are
accustomed and well trained, he is accustomed and well trained. One
feels worried about a new girlfriend; one never knows what she is going
to do—freak out in the middle of the night? One is nervous about the new
boyfriend, because one cannot predict what kind of</p><p>man he’s going to prove to be.</p><p>You are certain. In this certainty you should relax and let him come.
I don’t see that there is any problem. You are both perfectly happy in
your misery; all people are perfectly happy in their miserable
relationships! That’s why after a five weeks’ separation you feel good.
If the separation is for a longer time you will start missing him.</p><p>I have given just enough time so that you can enjoy freedom and he
can enjoy freedom, and in the right moment, when you start missing each
other, he’s back. Just wait!</p><p>And he’s not a dangerous person; he cannot harm you. He’s very good
at heart, just a little loose in his head. But to have a boyfriend who
is a little loose in the head is better than to have a boyfriend who is
a little tight in the head. I know it is no ordinary relationship: you
both are extraordinary.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part11>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

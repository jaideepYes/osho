And the problem with any absence is that you cannot do anything directly about it. Fear is like darkness. What can you do about darkness directly? You cannot drop it, you cannot throw it out, you cannot bring it in. There is no way to relate with darkness without bringing light in. The way to darkness goes via light. If you want darkness, put the light off; if you don’t want darkness, put the light on. But you will have to do something with light, not with darkness at all. The same is true about love and fear: love is light, fear is darkness. The person who becomes obsessed with fear will never be able to resolve the problem. It is like wrestling with darkness: you are bound to be exhausted sooner or later, tired and defeated. And the miracle is, defeated by something which is not there at all! And when one is defeated, one certainly feels how powerful the darkness is, how powerful the fear is, how powerful the ignorance is, how powerful the unconscious is. They are not powerful at all, they don’t exist in the first place.\nNever fight with the non-existential. That’s where all the ancient religions got lost. Once you start fighting with the non-existential you are doomed. Your small river of consciousness will be lost in the non-existential desert, and it is infinite.\nSo don’t make a problem out of fear. Love is the question. Something can be done about love immediately; there is no need to wait or postpone. Start loving! And it is a natural gift from existence to you, or from God, or from the whole, whichever term you like. If you are brought up in a religious way, then God; if you are not brought up in a religious way, then the whole, the universe, existence.\nRemember, love is born with you; it is your intrinsic quality. All that is needed is to give it a way—to make a passage for it, to let it flow, to allow it to happen.\nWe are all blocking it, holding it back. We are so miserly about love, for the simple reason that we have been taught a certain economics. That economics is perfectly right about the outside world: if you have just so much money and you go on giving that money to people, soon you will be a beggar. By just giving away money you will lose it. This economics, this arithmetic has entered into our blood, bones, and marrow. It is true about the outside world, and nothing is wrong in it, but it is not true about the inner journey. There, a totally different arithmetic functions: the more you give, the more you have; the less you give, the less you have. If you don’t give at all you will lose your natural qualities. They will become stagnant, closed; they will go underground. Finding no means of expression they will shrink and die.\nIt is like a musician: if he goes on playing on his guitar or on his flute, more and more music will come. It is not that by playing on the flute he is losing music—he is gaining. It is like a dancer: the more you dance, the more skillful you become. It is like painting: the more you paint, the better the paintings you create.\nOnce, while Picasso was painting, a critic and friend stopped him in the middle and said, “One question has been bothering me and I cannot wait anymore, I cannot contain it. I want to know: you have painted hundreds of paintings; which is your best painting?”\nPicasso said, “This one that I am painting right now.”\nThe critic said, “This one? What about the others that you have painted before?”\nPicasso said, “They are all contained in it. And the next one that I do will be even better than this, because the more you paint, the greater is your skill, the greater is your art.”\nSuch is love, such is joy—share it! In the beginning it will come only like dewdrops, because your miserliness has been in existence for so long, it is very ancient. But once even dewdrops of love have been shared, you will soon become capable of sharing the whole oceanic flood of your being, and you contain infinities.\nOnce you have known the higher mathematics of giving and gaining, you will find that just by giving you gain. Not that something is returned; in the very giving you are becoming richer. Then love starts spreading, radiating. And one day you will be surprised. Where is the fear? Even if you want to find it, you will not be able to find it at all.\nLove is not a relationship. Love relates, but it is not a relationship. A relationship is something finished. A relationship is a noun; the full stop has come, the honeymoon is over. Now there is no joy, no enthusiasm, now all is finished. You can carry it on, just to keep your promises. You can carry it on because it is comfortable, convenient, cozy. You can carry it on because there is nothing else to do. You can carry it on because if you disrupt it, it is going to create much trouble for you.\nRelationship means something complete, finished, closed. Love is never a relationship; love is relating. It is always a river, flowing, unending. Love knows no full stop; the honeymoon begins but never ends. It is not like a novel that starts at a certain point and ends at a certain point. It is an ongoing phenomenon. Lovers end, love continues. It is a continuum. It is a verb, not a noun.\nWhy do we reduce the beauty of relating to relationship? Why are we in such a hurry? Because to relate is insecure, and relationship is a security, relationship has a certainty. Relating is just a meeting of two strangers, maybe just an overnight stay and in the morning we say good-bye. Who knows what is going to happen tomorrow? And we are so afraid that we want to make it certain, we want to make it predictable. We would like tomorrow to be according to our ideas; we don’t allow it freedom to have its own say. So we immediately reduce every verb to a noun.\nYou are in love with a woman or a man and immediately you start thinking of getting married. Make it a legal contract. Why? How does the law come into love? The law comes into love because love is not there. It is only a fantasy, and you know the fantasy will disappear. Before it disappears, settle down. Before it disappears, do something so it becomes impossible to separate.\nIn a better world, with more meditative people, with a little more enlightenment spread over the earth, people will love, love immensely, but their love will remain a relating, not a relationship. And I am not saying that their love will be only momentary. There is every possibility their love may go deeper than your love, may have a higher quality of intimacy, may have something more of poetry and more of godliness in it. There is every possibility that their love may last longer than your so-called relationships ever last. But it will not be guaranteed by the law, by the court, by the policeman. The guarantee will be inner. It will be a commitment from the heart, it will be a silent communion.\nIf you enjoy being with somebody, you would like to enjoy it more and more. If you enjoy the intimacy, you would like to explore the intimacy more and more. And there are a few flowers of love that bloom only after long intimacies. There are seasonal flowers too; within six weeks they are there in the sun, but within six weeks again they are gone forever. There are flowers which take years to bloom, and there are flowers that keep blooming for many years to come. The longer it takes, the deeper it goes.\nBut it has to be a commitment from one heart to another heart. It has not even to be verbalized, because to verbalize it is to profane it. It has to be a silent commitment: eye to eye, heart to heart, being to being. It has to be understood, not said.\nIt is so ugly seeing people going to the church or the court to get married. It is so ugly, so inhuman. It simply shows they can’t trust themselves, they trust the authorities more than they trust their own inner voice. It shows that because they can’t trust their love, they trust the law.\nForget relationships and learn how to relate. Once you are in a relationship you start taking each other for granted. That’s what destroys all love affairs. The woman thinks she knows the man, the man thinks he knows the woman. Nobody knows! It is impossible to know the other, the other remains a mystery. And to take the other for granted is insulting, disrespectful.\nTo think that you know your partner is very ungrateful. How can you know the woman? How can you know the man? They are processes, they are not things. The woman that you knew yesterday is not there today. So much water has gone down the Ganges; she is somebody else, totally different. Relate again,\nstart again, don’t take it for granted.\nAnd the man who you slept with last night, look at his face again in the morning. He is no longer the same person, so much has changed. So much, incalculably much, has changed! That is the difference between a thing and a person. The furniture in the room is the same, but the man and the woman, they are no longer the same. Explore again, start again. That’s what I mean by relating.\nRelating means you are always starting, you are always trying to become acquainted. Again and again, you are introducing yourself to each other. You are trying to see the many facets of the other’s personality. You are trying to penetrate deeper and deeper into his realm of inner feelings, into the deep recesses of her being. You are trying to unravel a mystery which cannot be unraveled.\nThat is the joy of love: the exploration of consciousness.\nAnd if you relate, and don’t reduce it to a relationship, then the other will become a mirror to you. Exploring the other, unawares you will be exploring yourself too. Getting deeper into the other, knowing his feelings, his thoughts, his deeper stirrings, you will be knowing your own deeper stirrings too. Lovers become mirrors to each other, and then love becomes a meditation.\nRelationship is ugly, relating is beautiful.\nIn relationship both persons become blind to each other. Just think, how long has it been since you saw your lover eye to eye? How long has it been since you looked at your partner? Maybe years! Who looks at one’s own wife? You have already taken it for granted that you know her. What more is there to look at? You are more interested in strangers than in the people you know; you know the whole topography of their bodies, you know how they respond, you know everything that has happened is going to happen again and again. It is a repetitive circle.\nIt is not so, it is not really so. Nothing ever repeats; everything is new every day. Just your eyes become old, your assumptions become old, your mirror gathers dust and you become incapable of reflecting the other.\nHence I say relate. By saying relate, I mean remain continuously on a honeymoon. Go on searching and seeking each other, finding new ways of loving each other, finding new ways of being with each other. And each person is such an infinite mystery, inexhaustible, unfathomable, that it is not possible that you can ever say, “I have known her,” or, “I have known him.” At the most you can say, “I have tried my best, but the mystery remains a mystery.”\nIn fact the more you know, the more mysterious the other becomes. Then love is a constant adventure.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2077","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/being_in_love/part16/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/being_in_love/>Being in Love</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">CHAPTER 10: "LOVE" IS A VERB</h1><div class=post-meta>10 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2077 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Being_in_Love/part16.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part15>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

This economics, this arithmetic has entered into our blood, bones, and

arithmetic functions: the more you give, the more you have; the less you

being. It has to be understood, not said.</p><p>It is so ugly seeing people going to the church or the court to get
married. It is so ugly, so inhuman. It simply shows they can’t trust
themselves, they trust the authorities more than they trust their own
inner voice. It shows that because they can’t trust their love, they
trust the law.</p><p>Forget relationships and learn how to relate. Once you are in a
relationship you start taking each other for granted. That’s what
destroys all love affairs. The woman thinks she knows the man, the man
thinks he knows the woman. Nobody knows! It is impossible to know the
other, the other remains a mystery. And to take the other for granted is
insulting, disrespectful.</p><p>To think that you know your partner is very ungrateful. How can you
know the woman? How can you know the man? They are processes, they are
not things. The woman that you knew yesterday is not there today. So
much water has gone down the Ganges; she is somebody else, totally
different. Relate again,</p><p>start again, don’t take it for granted.</p><p>And the man who you slept with last night, look at his face again in
the morning. He is no longer the same person, so much has changed. So
much, incalculably much, has changed! That is the difference between a
thing and a person. The furniture in the room is the same, but the man
and the woman, they are no longer the same. Explore again, start again.
That’s what I mean by relating.</p><p>Relating means you are always starting, you are always trying to
become acquainted. Again and again, you are introducing yourself to each
other. You are trying to see the many facets of the other’s personality.
You are trying to penetrate deeper and deeper into his realm of inner
feelings, into the deep recesses of her being. You are trying to unravel
a mystery which cannot be unraveled.</p><p>That is the joy of love: the exploration of consciousness.</p><p>And if you relate, and don’t reduce it to a relationship, then the
other will become a mirror to you. Exploring the other, unawares you
will be exploring yourself too. Getting deeper into the other, knowing
his feelings, his thoughts, his deeper stirrings, you will be knowing
your own deeper stirrings too. Lovers become mirrors to each other, and
then love becomes a meditation.</p><p>Relationship is ugly, relating is beautiful.</p><p>In relationship both persons become blind to each other. Just think,
how long has it been since you saw your lover eye to eye? How long has
it been since you looked at your partner? Maybe years! Who looks at
one’s own wife? You have already taken it for granted that you know her.
What more is there to look at? You are more interested in strangers than
in the people you know; you know the whole topography of their bodies,
you know how they respond, you know everything that has happened is
going to happen again and again. It is a repetitive circle.</p><p>It is not so, it is not really so. Nothing ever repeats; everything
is new every day. Just your eyes become old, your assumptions become
old, your mirror gathers dust and you become incapable of reflecting the
other.</p><p>Hence I say relate. By saying relate, I mean remain continuously on a
honeymoon. Go on searching and seeking each other, finding new ways of
loving each other, finding new ways of being with each other. And each
person is such an infinite mystery, inexhaustible, unfathomable, that it
is not possible that you can ever say, “I have known her,” or, “I have
known him.” At the most you can say, “I have tried my best, but the
mystery remains a mystery.”</p><p>In fact the more you know, the more mysterious the other becomes.
Then love is a constant adventure.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part15>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

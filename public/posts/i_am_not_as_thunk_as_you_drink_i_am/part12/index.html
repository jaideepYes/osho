And they are all interrelated; if you create one the other three follow of their own accord. One need not think about all four, just choose one.\nAnd for you bliss is going to be the choice. Become more and more cheerful -- don't miss any opportunity. People are very stupid, they never opportunity to be miserable. Even if there opportunity they create it. If they cannot find one they invent one, they fantasise. If it is not in the present they start searching in the past; if it is not in the past they will think of the future, but somehow they have\nto find something to worry about, to be miserable about. Then there is no wonder that the world is full of misery.\nThe same should be done about bliss: never miss an opportunity -- and there are a thousand and one opportunities every day. Once you are alert you will be surprised how many opportunities you have been missing up to now. At each step there are opportunities. One need not invent them, one need not imagine them, they are always coming -- god goes on showering. But we are accustomed to a wrong attitude, a wrong approach, a negative approach towards life. We choose the thorns and we ignore the flowers.\nThe sannyasin changes the whole gestalt; he chooses the flowers, he ignores the thorns. If you choose the thorns and ignore the flowers, sooner or later there will be no flowers for you, only thorns. Even flowers will become thorns because your whole approach will be such that even a flower will only remind you of some thorns. And the opposite happens: if you choose the flowers even thorns remind you of beautiful flowers. By and by thorns disappears the whole of life becomes full of flowers; it becomes a springtime.\nAnd then god is not far away, he is very close. Once bliss starts happening you can feel him closer o than the heart, closer than your own heartbeat.\n(Osho adds 'dhyan' to Peter's name.)\nPeople without meditation are making their houses on the shifting sands of time. Those houses are bound to collapse and then there is misery, frustration, failure, darkness, gloom. And if all the houses that you create go on collapsing, naturally you feel depressed. Then life is no more a celebration, it is no more a song of joy. It is just a scream of deep pain.\nBut the house of life can be built on a rock, the rock of eternity -- that's what meditation makes available to you.\nMeditation is the jump from time to no-time, from the momentary to the eternal. It is the greatest revolution possible and it can happen just by changing your focus. It is not an impossible task; all that is needed is a little understanding.\nYou may be standing before a wall and of course you cannot see the beautiful sunset outside. You have to understand that you cannot see through the wall so move to a window. And don't stand before a window if it is closed, open it! Or\nmove to the door and open it! Or go outside the door. Standing before a wall don't expect to see stars, the moon, flowers, birds, people. You cannot see anything. Standing before a wall you will simply become bored, and boredom is one of the greatest problems every human being faces. But it is just because you go on standing in the same place. You don't learn to shift your focus, change your place.\nThe mind is like a wall. Meditation is an open window, a door. Mind is the thick wall; there are thousands of thoughts, layer upon layer. It is impossible to penetrate that wall. It is thicker than any wall can be.\nJust move from mind to no-mind. And the strategy of movement is simple, very simple: just watch your thoughts moving. Don't make any judgement about those thoughts, don't call them good or bad, don't make 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nany evaluation. Remain indifferent, as if it is none of your concern. Let them pass; good and bad, alike, relevant, irrelevant, all alike.\nIf you can remain in this indifferent state you are in for a great surprise: as your indifference towards the mind grows deeper, becomes rooted, the mind starts disappearing, the wall starts disappearing; a window opens, a door opens. Suddenly you can see the splendour of life and the eternity of life. Time has been transcended. And just a single glimpse is enough. Then you know the secret, then the key is in your hands.\nThen you can go on moving deeper and deeper into that experience.\nMeditation is the beginning, samadhi is the end. Sannyas begins with meditation and ends in absolute ecstasy.\n(To Michael from America -- billed as a Kung Fu teacher and a rabbi -- Osho talks of love and of god.\nThere is no proof for god logically, intellectually. Intellectually the atheist is in a\nfar better position; the theist is bound to get defeated because the theist has no proofs for god. The atheist can disprove all the proofs that the theist supplies, but the theist is right and the atheist is not right because god is not a question of intellectual argumentation, it is an existential experience -- just like love.\nYou cannot prove that it is. If somebody insists, it will be impossible to prove. You fall in love with a woman and she insists if she is logical -- which is rare and that is good... If she is philosophical she can create trouble for you. She can ask for the proof: 'What proof have you got that you are really in love? And what is love in the first place?' Intellectually you cannot convince her. You will be at a loss, you will not be able to answer. Whatsoever you say will look absurd.\nOne of the great Christian mystics, Tertullian, is right when he says 'I believe in god because he cannot be proved. I believe in god because god is absurd: credo qua absurdum.' It is one of the greatest statements ever made, and only a mystic can make such a daring statement I believe in god because he cannot be proved.\nLife needs a few things which cannot be proved. Only because of those few things does life become meaningful. Things that can be proved never give life meaning. Science cannot impart meaning to life; it proves everything. No scientific statement is unproved. It is proved logically, intellectually, experimentally.\nYou can experiment in thousands of ways and the result will be the same again and again without any exception. But science does not make life meaningful. It makes it comfortable, it makes life convenient, cosy, it gives you all kinds of gadgets. But they are all on the outside; deep inside you don't have any meaning. Meaning needs something more than proof, something more than experiment. Meaning needs experience, not experiment.\nGod and love are on exactly the same plane. Begin with love because that is more natural. And if one can love that means one is ready to go into the illogical, one is courageous enough to put logic aside. Then in the next step one can move towards god, one can agree with Tertullian.\nLove will give you the first experience of something that transcends intellect. So the real mystics don't give any proofs for god; the people who give proofs for god are theologians, not mystics, thinkers but not mystics; they have not experienced. And those theologians have created great trouble, unnecessary\ntrouble.\nIn fact it is because of them and their stupidity that the atheist has always won the case. They provide things which he can disprove and easily disprove. I have never come across a single proof for god that cannot be disproved very easily, even by a child. Just a little intelligence is needed. The theologian has played into the hands of the atheist; he has not served god, he has not served religion. In fact he has done a great dis-service.\nThe mystic is in a far better situation. He will laugh at all the arguments both for and against. His existence is the only proof, his love is the only proof, his blissfulness is the only proof, his silence is the only proof. He can invite the atheist and he can tell the atheist to be with him: maybe at some moment you are open and something from me can enter you and trigger a process. But more than that is not possible.\nIf theologians stop proving god, atheists will disappear from the world because they will not have anything to disprove. They cannot disprove the mystic -- that is impossible -- because he never gives any argument. To disprove the mystic they will have to meditate. And once a person meditates, he himself will become a mystic.\nMy whole effort here is against theology. I am all for love and absolutely against logic.\n(Compassion is the only criterion to judge whether one is a meditator, Buddha said. It is so, affirms Osho, because meditation happens in the most private recesses of your being.) 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nIt is so absolutely private that you cannot invite anybody into your world of meditation. It is not possible at all.\nMeditation means your absolute aloneness, where only your consciousness exists, and there is no other so you cannot take anybody there. But meditation\nstarts affecting your behaviour, it starts affecting your actions, your relationships, it affects everything. And slowly slowly whatsoever you do has something of your meditation in it -- and that is compassion. You start doing things out of great love, love for the whole existence.\nSo meditation is the inner phenomenon and compassion is the outer expression of it. Because of this a great calamity has also happened: knowing that compassion is inevitably there when meditation happens, people have tried to cultivate compassion. And that can be done, but it does not bring meditation. That cultivated compassion remains superficial, not even skin-deep. And that is what has happened to Christian missionaries for these past twenty centuries; they have been trying to do service and to love and to help humanity, to be compassionate, but they don't know anything of meditation; hence their compassion is plastic, synthetic, it has no roots. Just scratch any missionary a little bit and you will find an ordinary human being or even worse.\nYou can paint the circumference but that does not change the centre. But if the centre changes -- and the centre cannot be painted... The surface can be painted but the centre is not available; you cannot paint it. It is so deep inside that nothing can be done to falsify it. It always remains in its truth.\nOnce you have experienced your centre in silence, once you have realised yourself, the circumference is bound to change, you need not change it. Hence I am against creating any kind of character. Cultivating a character is superficial. It deceives others, It deceives you -- and life is too precious to waste in such stupid things as deceiving others and deceiving yourself. Death will come and destroy all your hypocrisy and you will be left alone and then except for meditation nothing can be of help. Only meditation can allow you to enjoy your aloneness. The meditator dies blissfully because he has really died before the ordinary death ever happens.\nThe moment he knows his centre he knows that he is not the body, not the mind either. That day the real death happens and he knows that by leaving the body nothing dies. He will be moving into a vaster space, he will be becoming far richer than he has ever been. He will be really freed from a prison. And when you feel this eternity, this joy of being part of eternity and the whole, naturally your life starts showing compassion for all those who are still struggling in the darkness, groping in darkness and who cannot find their way. But this is nothing cultivated, it happens naturally. When character comes naturally it has a\ntremendous beauty.\nMy sannyasins has to begin with the centre and leave the circumference; don't touch it. Once you have known your being you will see the miracle happening of its own accord: your life will become compassion.\nInstead of passion it will be transformed into compassion.\n(To Majsan from Sweden, Osho gives the name Prem Suvasa, which means love and perfume or fragrance.)\nLove is a flowering, the flowering of your consciousness. The moment your consciousness opens its petals great fragrance is released. And once that fragrance is released one feels tremendously contented, fulfilled, because one has come to the ultimate peak of flowering. To remain a seed is to remain in misery; to become a flower is to become blissful. Then one has attained; one's potential is transformed into a reality.\nThat's the meaning of realisation: that which was only a possibility has become actual, a reality. Life has not been in vain, you have not missed the opportunity. One feels one has come home, and that very feeling gives a fragrance to the person. And those who are sensitive will feel it, those who are open will immediately recognise it. In fact whenever somebody's inner lotus opens people start coming from faraway places. In some mysterious way the vibe starts reaching the farthest corners of the earth. It has always been so.\nThat is the significance of the story in Jesus' life that when he was born three wise men from the East went in search of the child. They were guided by a star in the sky. Now, this is a parable. Stars cannot guide anybody. They have their own orbit; they cannot leave their orbit and start guiding somebody. But the meaning is great. The meaning is that some unknown force was guiding them, some miraculous magnetism was pulling them. It was as if a light was guiding, a star was guiding them. They felt that somebody for whom they has been waiting had been born. From different parts of the East those three wise men started moving towards the place where this miracle had happened.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThe same 1s the story about Buddha. When he was born a very great old sage came down from the Himalayas. He must have been more than one hundred years old. He was well-known all over the country, and for seventy years he had not left his cave in the Himalayas. And suddenly he came down. Buddha was born just on the border of Nepal and India, just below the Himalayas. The sage came running.\nThe father of Buddha fell at his feet because he was such a great, well-known saint and he said 'This is a great blessing. Why have you come?' The sage said 'Where is the child? I have come to see him because when he becomes a Buddha I will not be here.'\nAnd the child was brought, just a one-day-old child. The sage touched the feet of the child and wept.\nThe king was very much puzzled and worried too -- why was he weeping? He asked 'What is the significance of your weeping?' The sage said 'Don't worry -- I am weeping out of joy and out of sadness too: joy for the child that a great Buddha is born and sad for myself because when he is really an opened lotus...\nRight now he is just a bud. Only people like me can recognise him,' the old man said, 'but when he is recognised by thousands of people I will not be here -- I am crying for that. I am happy that he is born and I am unhappy because I am going to die; this is my last year on earth. That's why I rushed quickly: I may fall ill, I may not even be able to see the child, but I am happy that I have seen him. Although he is still a bud and it will take time, it is absolutely certain that he will become one of the greatest lotuses ever. His perfume will pervade humanity for centuries.'\nMy sannyasins have to learn the art of opening their consciousness. And one of the keys is love. To you I give the key of love. Be loving and that will help your opening. And everybody is carrying the perfume, it just needs the right effort to be released. Once it is released there is great joy not only in you, the whole existence rejoices in it.\n(Prem Sagari is Lena's new name. Be miserly in love and you'll be miserable,\nOsho begins.) Love brings bliss if it is vast. If love is one-dimensional it becomes a bondage; if it is multi-dimensional it becomes a freedom. Almost everybody loves in his own way but it more or less creates hell. Nothing is wrong with the energy called love; what is wrong is that we are trying to focus our love in a certain direction, pin-pointing it -- which is unnatural. Then it creates jealousy, possessiveness, conflict, struggle, because the other is also doing the same and both are trying to do something unnatural. Humanity has lived under this shadow for centuries so it has become our second nature.\nLove that can create great bliss is only creating hell. And many people are fed up with it and it has not been so just now; for centuries many people have felt the misery and they have renounced the world, but that is not the solution.\nThe solution is in a different directions love should not be confined and should not be conditional. It should be like the fragrance of a flower which spreads in all directions. It has no address; it is not that it has to reach a particular person; it is unaddressed. And when your love is also like an unaddressed fragrance you will be surprised: it only brings bliss it creates paradise around you.\nMy effort here is to help your love become greater. All the so-called religions have been trying just the opposite. Seeing that love creates misery they teach the renouncing of love. I also see that love creates misery but seeing that I teach the renouncing of limitations. Let your love become unlimited.\nThe so-called religious traditions and my approach begin from the same point but we move in different directions. They think it is love that is creating the trouble; I don't see that it is love that is creating the trouble. It is the limitation that you impose upon love -- that is creating trouble. Renouncing love is not the solution. Renounce the limitation. Just be loving. Let love be a spontaneous, natural phenomenon. Don't make it a relationship; relate but don't become confined to relationship.\nThe moment you free your love from limitations you are free. The moment your love is free your very being is free because your being consists of love, your soul consists of love.\n(To a middle-aged woman, a child psychologist, Osho gives the name Chaitanyo\n-- pure consciousness.) Consciousness is impure if it is full of thoughts, desires, memories, fantasies, dreams. When all these contents are dropped, when\nconsciousness is just empty of everything, it is pure. And in that purity god is experienced. That purity is the basic qualification for experiencing truth, god, liberation. The function of meditation is to destroy the content, to help you get rid of all the contents.\nFor example, if you watch your mind you will be able to see very easily that it is pointless to go on carrying the past; it is no more. It is non-existential, it is an unnecessary burden, useless luggage. And it goes on becoming bigger every day because the past goes on becoming bigger. As you live more 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nexperiences, more memories accumulate, and it becomes a mountain -- really heavy. People are crushed under it.\nThe moment you see that it is useless you can drop it. It is not clinging to you, you are clinging to it, so you simply take your hands away. Then the next thing that comes through watchfulness is that you become aware that the future is not yet so why be bothered about it? When it comes we will see, we will respond.\nThere is no need to be worried about it -- it may never come or it may come in such a way that you cannot imagine it right now. It is unpredictable. Whatsoever you think about it, ninety-nine per cent of it is never going to happen. And wasting your energy for that one per cent is sheer foolishness.\nOnce you see it you withdraw from the future -- and the past and the future are one hundred per cent of your mind, the whole content. Fifty per cent belongs to the past, fifty per cent to the future. In the present there is no content. If one is just herenow then consciousness is empty.\nYou can see, whenever you look in your mind either something from the past is moving or something from the future. As far as this very moment is concerned consciousness is pure. And the meditator by slowly slowly dropping the past and the future starts settling in the present.\nTo live herenow is to live a religious life. That is pure consciousness and out of\npure consciousness whatsoever happens is virtue. Whatsoever you do is right. Whatsoever your response you will never repent for it, you will never feel guilty for it.\n(Full of light is the meaning of Gudrun's new name -- Jyotirmaya,) Man ordinarily lives in darkness. We are born in darkness. In fact darkness is a basic need in the beginning. There is darkness in the mother's womb. It is needed because light will be a disturbance for the growing child. The child is so soft, so tender; it needs velvety darkness to surround it. And the child sleeps for twenty- four hours a day in the mother's womb: light will disturb his sleep, and sleep is a must. In those nine months the child is growing so much that there needs to be no disturbance, otherwise energy will be diverted. So darkness helps the child to remain relaxed.\nEverything in the beginning grows in darkness. You put the seed in the ground you dig a little bit, then you put the seed in. If you just throw it on the ground then it may not grow because there is too much light there. It needs the womb, the womb of the earth to grow in -- there it is dark. Once the seed starts growing it starts rising above the earth. Then it starts reaching towards the sun, towards the moon, towards the stars.\nThe child is born physically he comes into light but spiritually he still remains in darkness. And that darkness can be dispelled only through meditation; hence meditation gives you a second birth. The first birth is physical, the second is spiritual. And that is the whole meaning of initiation into sannyas: it has to become a second birth. Physically you are in light, now you need another birth too -- so that psychologically, spiritually also, you are in full light. And there is no difficulty in it, it is just that people are not aware of it. They never think about it, they have never bothered about it, so they remain only physical beings. They never grow spiritually.\nWhile you are here concentrate your whole energy on meditation so that you can learn the secret. It is a knack. Just by doing all the meditations here, one day you will find which meditation fits with you. And the moment it fits something clicks. Suddenly you know 'This is the method for me.' And the knowing is so absolute and categorical that no doubt ever arises. Then move with that meditation, then let that meditation become the central-most thing in your life, because you will be born into light through it.\nLight is another name for god. And to be born into that light is the whole purpose of sannyas. One moment you are born into that light you are enlightened.

diary, which has been scanned and cleaned up. It is for reference
purposes only.]</p><p>(There are certain experiences in which one comes closest to knowing
godliness; they are like four pillars of a temple, Osho tells Anand
Michiel.)</p><p>Without these four the temple cannot exist. And they are all
interrelated; if you create one the other three follow of their own
accord. One need not think about all four, just choose one.</p><p>And for you bliss is going to be the choice. Become more and more
cheerful -- don't miss any opportunity. People are very stupid, they
never opportunity to be miserable. Even if there opportunity they create
it. If they cannot find one they invent one, they fantasise. If it is
not in the present they start searching in the past; if it is not in the
past they will think of the future, but somehow they have</p><p>to find something to worry about, to be miserable about. Then there
is no wonder that the world is full of misery.</p><p>The same should be done about bliss: never miss an opportunity -- and
there are a thousand and one opportunities every day. Once you are alert
you will be surprised how many opportunities you have been missing up to
now. At each step there are opportunities. One need not invent them, one
need not imagine them, they are always coming -- god goes on showering.
But we are accustomed to a wrong attitude, a wrong approach, a negative
approach towards life. We choose the thorns and we ignore the
flowers.</p><p>The sannyasin changes the whole gestalt; he chooses the flowers, he
ignores the thorns. If you choose the thorns and ignore the flowers,
sooner or later there will be no flowers for you, only thorns. Even
flowers will become thorns because your whole approach will be such that
even a flower will only remind you of some thorns. And the opposite
happens: if you choose the flowers even thorns remind you of beautiful
flowers. By and by thorns disappears the whole of life becomes full of
flowers; it becomes a springtime.</p><p>And then god is not far away, he is very close. Once bliss starts
happening you can feel him closer o than the heart, closer than your own
heartbeat.</p><p>(Osho adds 'dhyan' to Peter's name.)</p><p>People without meditation are making their houses on the shifting
sands of time. Those houses are bound to collapse and then there is
misery, frustration, failure, darkness, gloom. And if all the houses
that you create go on collapsing, naturally you feel depressed. Then
life is no more a celebration, it is no more a song of joy. It is just a
scream of deep pain.</p><p>But the house of life can be built on a rock, the rock of eternity --
that's what meditation makes available to you.</p><p>Meditation is the jump from time to no-time, from the momentary to
the eternal. It is the greatest revolution possible and it can happen
just by changing your focus. It is not an impossible task; all that is
needed is a little understanding.</p><p>You may be standing before a wall and of course you cannot see the
beautiful sunset outside. You have to understand that you cannot see
through the wall so move to a window. And don't stand before a window if
it is closed, open it! Or</p><p>move to the door and open it! Or go outside the door. Standing before
a wall don't expect to see stars, the moon, flowers, birds, people. You
cannot see anything. Standing before a wall you will simply become
bored, and boredom is one of the greatest problems every human being
faces. But it is just because you go on standing in the same place. You
don't learn to shift your focus, change your place.</p><p>The mind is like a wall. Meditation is an open window, a door. Mind
is the thick wall; there are thousands of thoughts, layer upon layer. It
is impossible to penetrate that wall. It is thicker than any wall can
be.</p><p>Just move from mind to no-mind. And the strategy of movement is
simple, very simple: just watch your thoughts moving. Don't make any
judgement about those thoughts, don't call them good or bad, don't make

Let them pass; good and bad, alike, relevant, irrelevant, all alike.</p><p>If you can remain in this indifferent state you are in for a great
surprise: as your indifference towards the mind grows deeper, becomes
rooted, the mind starts disappearing, the wall starts disappearing; a
window opens, a door opens. Suddenly you can see the splendour of life
and the eternity of life. Time has been transcended. And just a single
glimpse is enough. Then you know the secret, then the key is in your
hands.</p><p>Then you can go on moving deeper and deeper into that experience.</p><p>Meditation is the beginning, samadhi is the end. Sannyas begins with
meditation and ends in absolute ecstasy.</p><p>(To Michael from America -- billed as a Kung Fu teacher and a rabbi
-- Osho talks of love and of god.</p><p>There is no proof for god logically, intellectually. Intellectually
the atheist is in a</p><p>far better position; the theist is bound to get defeated because the
theist has no proofs for god. The atheist can disprove all the proofs
that the theist supplies, but the theist is right and the atheist is not
right because god is not a question of intellectual argumentation, it is
an existential experience -- just like love.</p><p>You cannot prove that it is. If somebody insists, it will be
impossible to prove. You fall in love with a woman and she insists if
she is logical -- which is rare and that is good... If she is
philosophical she can create trouble for you. She can ask for the proof:
'What proof have you got that you are really in love? And what is love
in the first place?' Intellectually you cannot convince her. You will be
at a loss, you will not be able to answer. Whatsoever you say will look
absurd.</p><p>One of the great Christian mystics, Tertullian, is right when he says
'I believe in god because he cannot be proved. I believe in god because
god is absurd: <em>credo qua absurdum</em>.' It is one of the greatest
statements ever made, and only a mystic can make such a daring statement
I believe in god because he cannot be proved.</p><p>Life needs a few things which cannot be proved. Only because of those
few things does life become meaningful. Things that can be proved never
give life meaning. Science cannot impart meaning to life; it proves
everything. No scientific statement is unproved. It is proved logically,
intellectually, experimentally.</p><p>You can experiment in thousands of ways and the result will be the
same again and again without any exception. But science does not make
life meaningful. It makes it comfortable, it makes life convenient,
cosy, it gives you all kinds of gadgets. But they are all on the
outside; deep inside you don't have any meaning. Meaning needs something
more than proof, something more than experiment. Meaning needs
experience, not experiment.</p><p>God and love are on exactly the same plane. Begin with love because
that is more natural. And if one can love that means one is ready to go
into the illogical, one is courageous enough to put logic aside. Then in
the next step one can move towards god, one can agree with
Tertullian.</p><p>Love will give you the first experience of something that transcends
intellect. So the real mystics don't give any proofs for god; the people
who give proofs for god are theologians, not mystics, thinkers but not
mystics; they have not experienced. And those theologians have created
great trouble, unnecessary</p><p>trouble.</p><p>In fact it is because of them and their stupidity that the atheist
has always won the case. They provide things which he can disprove and
easily disprove. I have never come across a single proof for god that
cannot be disproved very easily, even by a child. Just a little
intelligence is needed. The theologian has played into the hands of the
atheist; he has not served god, he has not served religion. In fact he
has done a great dis-service.</p><p>The mystic is in a far better situation. He will laugh at all the
arguments both for and against. His existence is the only proof, his
love is the only proof, his blissfulness is the only proof, his silence
is the only proof. He can invite the atheist and he can tell the atheist
to be with him: maybe at some moment you are open and something from me
can enter you and trigger a process. But more than that is not
possible.</p><p>If theologians stop proving god, atheists will disappear from the
world because they will not have anything to disprove. They cannot
disprove the mystic -- that is impossible -- because he never gives any
argument. To disprove the mystic they will have to meditate. And once a
person meditates, he himself will become a mystic.</p><p>My whole effort here is against theology. I am all for love and
absolutely against logic.</p><p>(Compassion is the only criterion to judge whether one is a
meditator, Buddha said. It is so, affirms Osho, because meditation
happens in the most private recesses of your being.) 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>It is so absolutely private that you cannot invite anybody into your
world of meditation. It is not possible at all.</p><p>Meditation means your absolute aloneness, where only your
consciousness exists, and there is no other so you cannot take anybody
there. But meditation</p><p>starts affecting your behaviour, it starts affecting your actions,
your relationships, it affects everything. And slowly slowly whatsoever
you do has something of your meditation in it -- and that is compassion.
You start doing things out of great love, love for the whole
existence.</p><p>So meditation is the inner phenomenon and compassion is the outer
expression of it. Because of this a great calamity has also happened:
knowing that compassion is inevitably there when meditation happens,
people have tried to cultivate compassion. And that can be done, but it
does not bring meditation. That cultivated compassion remains
superficial, not even skin-deep. And that is what has happened to
Christian missionaries for these past twenty centuries; they have been
trying to do service and to love and to help humanity, to be
compassionate, but they don't know anything of meditation; hence their
compassion is plastic, synthetic, it has no roots. Just scratch any
missionary a little bit and you will find an ordinary human being or
even worse.</p><p>You can paint the circumference but that does not change the centre.
But if the centre changes -- and the centre cannot be painted... The
surface can be painted but the centre is not available; you cannot paint
it. It is so deep inside that nothing can be done to falsify it. It
always remains in its truth.</p><p>Once you have experienced your centre in silence, once you have
realised yourself, the circumference is bound to change, you need not
change it. Hence I am against creating any kind of character.
Cultivating a character is superficial. It deceives others, It deceives
you -- and life is too precious to waste in such stupid things as
deceiving others and deceiving yourself. Death will come and destroy all
your hypocrisy and you will be left alone and then except for meditation
nothing can be of help. Only meditation can allow you to enjoy your
aloneness. The meditator dies blissfully because he has really died
before the ordinary death ever happens.</p><p>The moment he knows his centre he knows that he is not the body, not
the mind either. That day the real death happens and he knows that by
leaving the body nothing dies. He will be moving into a vaster space, he
will be becoming far richer than he has ever been. He will be really
freed from a prison. And when you feel this eternity, this joy of being
part of eternity and the whole, naturally your life starts showing
compassion for all those who are still struggling in the darkness,
groping in darkness and who cannot find their way. But this is nothing
cultivated, it happens naturally. When character comes naturally it has
a</p><p>tremendous beauty.</p><p>My sannyasins has to begin with the centre and leave the
circumference; don't touch it. Once you have known your being you will
see the miracle happening of its own accord: your life will become
compassion.</p><p>Instead of passion it will be transformed into compassion.</p><p>(To Majsan from Sweden, Osho gives the name Prem Suvasa, which means
love and perfume or fragrance.)</p><p>Love is a flowering, the flowering of your consciousness. The moment
your consciousness opens its petals great fragrance is released. And
once that fragrance is released one feels tremendously contented,
fulfilled, because one has come to the ultimate peak of flowering. To
remain a seed is to remain in misery; to become a flower is to become
blissful. Then one has attained; one's potential is transformed into a
reality.</p><p>That's the meaning of realisation: that which was only a possibility
has become actual, a reality. Life has not been in vain, you have not
missed the opportunity. One feels one has come home, and that very
feeling gives a fragrance to the person. And those who are sensitive
will feel it, those who are open will immediately recognise it. In fact
whenever somebody's inner lotus opens people start coming from faraway
places. In some mysterious way the vibe starts reaching the farthest
corners of the earth. It has always been so.</p><p>That is the significance of the story in Jesus' life that when he was
born three wise men from the East went in search of the child. They were
guided by a star in the sky. Now, this is a parable. Stars cannot guide
anybody. They have their own orbit; they cannot leave their orbit and
start guiding somebody. But the meaning is great. The meaning is that
some unknown force was guiding them, some miraculous magnetism was
pulling them. It was as if a light was guiding, a star was guiding them.
They felt that somebody for whom they has been waiting had been born.
From different parts of the East those three wise men started moving
towards the place where this miracle had happened.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>The same 1s the story about Buddha. When he was born a very great old
sage came down from the Himalayas. He must have been more than one
hundred years old. He was well-known all over the country, and for
seventy years he had not left his cave in the Himalayas. And suddenly he
came down. Buddha was born just on the border of Nepal and India, just
below the Himalayas. The sage came running.</p><p>The father of Buddha fell at his feet because he was such a great,
well-known saint and he said 'This is a great blessing. Why have you
come?' The sage said 'Where is the child? I have come to see him because
when he becomes a Buddha I will not be here.'</p><p>And the child was brought, just a one-day-old child. The sage touched
the feet of the child and wept.</p><p>The king was very much puzzled and worried too -- why was he weeping?
He asked 'What is the significance of your weeping?' The sage said
'Don't worry -- I am weeping out of joy and out of sadness too: joy for
the child that a great Buddha is born and sad for myself because when he
is really an opened lotus...</p><p>Right now he is just a bud. Only people like me can recognise him,'
the old man said, 'but when he is recognised by thousands of people I
will not be here -- I am crying for that. I am happy that he is born and
I am unhappy because I am going to die; this is my last year on earth.
That's why I rushed quickly: I may fall ill, I may not even be able to
see the child, but I am happy that I have seen him. Although he is still
a bud and it will take time, it is absolutely certain that he will
become one of the greatest lotuses ever. His perfume will pervade
humanity for centuries.'</p><p>My sannyasins have to learn the art of opening their consciousness.
And one of the keys is love. To you I give the key of love. Be loving
and that will help your opening. And everybody is carrying the perfume,
it just needs the right effort to be released. Once it is released there
is great joy not only in you, the whole existence rejoices in it.</p><p>(Prem Sagari is Lena's new name. Be miserly in love and you'll be
miserable,</p><p>Osho begins.) Love brings bliss if it is vast. If love is
one-dimensional it becomes a bondage; if it is multi-dimensional it
becomes a freedom. Almost everybody loves in his own way but it more or
less creates hell. Nothing is wrong with the energy called love; what is
wrong is that we are trying to focus our love in a certain direction,
pin-pointing it -- which is unnatural. Then it creates jealousy,
possessiveness, conflict, struggle, because the other is also doing the
same and both are trying to do something unnatural. Humanity has lived
under this shadow for centuries so it has become our second nature.</p><p>Love that can create great bliss is only creating hell. And many
people are fed up with it and it has not been so just now; for centuries
many people have felt the misery and they have renounced the world, but
that is not the solution.</p><p>The solution is in a different directions love should not be confined
and should not be conditional. It should be like the fragrance of a
flower which spreads in all directions. It has no address; it is not
that it has to reach a particular person; it is unaddressed. And when
your love is also like an unaddressed fragrance you will be surprised:
it only brings bliss it creates paradise around you.</p><p>My effort here is to help your love become greater. All the so-called
religions have been trying just the opposite. Seeing that love creates
misery they teach the renouncing of love. I also see that love creates
misery but seeing that I teach the renouncing of limitations. Let your
love become unlimited.</p><p>The so-called religious traditions and my approach begin from the
same point but we move in different directions. They think it is love
that is creating the trouble; I don't see that it is love that is
creating the trouble. It is the limitation that you impose upon love --
that is creating trouble. Renouncing love is not the solution. Renounce
the limitation. Just be loving. Let love be a spontaneous, natural
phenomenon. Don't make it a relationship; relate but don't become
confined to relationship.</p><p>The moment you free your love from limitations <em>you</em> are free.
The moment your love is free your very being is free because your being
consists of love, your soul consists of love.</p><p>(To a middle-aged woman, a child psychologist, Osho gives the name
Chaitanyo</p><p>-- pure consciousness.) Consciousness is impure if it is full of
thoughts, desires, memories, fantasies, dreams. When all these contents
are dropped, when</p><p>consciousness is just empty of everything, it is pure. And in that
purity god is experienced. That purity is the basic qualification for
experiencing truth, god, liberation. The function of meditation is to
destroy the content, to help you get rid of all the contents.</p><p>For example, if you watch your mind you will be able to see very
easily that it is pointless to go on carrying the past; it is no more.
It is non-existential, it is an unnecessary burden, useless luggage. And
it goes on becoming bigger every day because the past goes on becoming
bigger. As you live more 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-4>Osho's books on

really heavy. People are crushed under it.</p><p>The moment you see that it is useless you can drop it. It is not
clinging to you, you are clinging to it, so you simply take your hands
away. Then the next thing that comes through watchfulness is that you
become aware that the future is not yet so why be bothered about it?
When it comes we will see, we will respond.</p><p>There is no need to be worried about it -- it may never come or it
may come in such a way that you cannot imagine it right now. It is
unpredictable. Whatsoever you think about it, ninety-nine per cent of it
is never going to happen. And wasting your energy for that one per cent
is sheer foolishness.</p><p>Once you see it you withdraw from the future -- and the past and the
future are one hundred per cent of your mind, the whole content. Fifty
per cent belongs to the past, fifty per cent to the future. In the
present there is no content. If one is just herenow then consciousness
is empty.</p><p>You can see, whenever you look in your mind either something from the
past is moving or something from the future. As far as <em>this</em>
very moment is concerned consciousness is pure. And the meditator by
slowly slowly dropping the past and the future starts settling in the
present.</p><p>To live herenow is to live a religious life. That is pure
consciousness and out of</p><p>pure consciousness whatsoever happens is virtue. Whatsoever you do is
right. Whatsoever your response you will never repent for it, you will
never feel guilty for it.</p><p>(Full of light is the meaning of Gudrun's new name -- Jyotirmaya,)
Man ordinarily lives in darkness. We are born in darkness. In fact
darkness is a basic need in the beginning. There is darkness in the
mother's womb. It is needed because light will be a disturbance for the
growing child. The child is so soft, so tender; it needs velvety
darkness to surround it. And the child sleeps for twenty- four hours a
day in the mother's womb: light will disturb his sleep, and sleep is a
must. In those nine months the child is growing so much that there needs
to be no disturbance, otherwise energy will be diverted. So darkness
helps the child to remain relaxed.</p><p>Everything in the beginning grows in darkness. You put the seed in
the ground you dig a little bit, then you put the seed in. If you just
throw it on the ground then it may not grow because there is too much
light there. It needs the womb, the womb of the earth to grow in --
there it is dark. Once the seed starts growing it starts rising above
the earth. Then it starts reaching towards the sun, towards the moon,
towards the stars.</p><p>The child is born physically he comes into light but spiritually he
still remains in darkness. And that darkness can be dispelled only
through meditation; hence meditation gives you a second birth. The first
birth is physical, the second is spiritual. And that is the whole
meaning of initiation into sannyas: it has to become a second birth.
Physically you are in light, now you need another birth too -- so that
psychologically, spiritually also, you are in full light. And there is
no difficulty in it, it is just that people are not aware of it. They
never think about it, they have never bothered about it, so they remain
only physical beings. They never grow spiritually.</p><p>While you are here concentrate your whole energy on meditation so
that you can learn the secret. It is a knack. Just by doing all the
meditations here, one day you will find which meditation fits with you.
And the moment it fits something clicks. Suddenly you know 'This is the
method for me.' And the knowing is so absolute and categorical that no
doubt ever arises. Then move with that meditation, then let that
meditation become the central-most thing in your life, because you will
be born into light through it.</p><p>Light is another name for god. And to be born into that light is the
whole purpose of sannyas. One moment you are born into that light you
are enlightened. That is the meaning of the word 'enlightened' --</p><p>because to be in that light means to become that light. One melts and
merges and becomes one with it. You are not two; you are not the seer

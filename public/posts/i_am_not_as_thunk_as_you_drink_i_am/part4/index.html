Everybody is born with the seed but very few people are capable of transforming it into reality. That's why you don't see so many joyful people in the world, blissful people in the world. Everywhere there is great misery, darkness. People are somehow managing to live but there is no dance, no song, no music in their lives. They are living life as a curse, not as a blessing, for the simple reason that they have taken it for granted that love is a reality. It is not. It has to be realised.\nOf course the potential is there, the possibility is there, the seed is there, but one\nneeds courage to grow it. And why courage? -- because the basic requirement for love's growth is dropping the idea of the ego.\nBoth cannot be together, ego and love. If one remains enclosed in the ego love remains only a potential, a hope, a promise which is never going to be fulfilled. If one comes out of the imprisonment of the ego then suddenly there is great rejoicing in your being, love starts growing.\nTo be in a growing state of love is to be a sannyasin. To realise the ultimate in love is to be awakened, to be enlightened, to be a Christ or to be a Buddha.\n(Meditation is a holiday from the mind, Osho tells Dhyan Catherine.) Otherwise all holidays are false because the mind goes on running. In fact on holidays it is more crazy because it has all the space, all the time, to go as insane as possible. On holidays more people go insane, more people commit suicide, more people murder. There are more accidents on holidays, of course, because everybody has space and time and somebody is bound to get into trouble.\nIt is good that people are continuously engaged in routine work. The greatest problem that the future humanity is going to face is when machines take all the work over and man has seven days holiday per week; then the real trouble will arise, Then you will see everybody going berserk; people will not know what to do. And they will do all kinds of things because the mind is always there racing, running, becoming more and more speedy.\nWhen this whole functioning of the mind ceases there is silence. And in that silence is purity -- that is the meaning of Catherine. Catherine means purity. To be without mind is to be pure. Mind is a pollution, a contamination, it is a poisoning process.\nWhen the mind is put aside you are your natural self, your spontaneity is there. You have clarity, perspective, vision. And out of that many things grow. These three qualities are associated with the name Catherine: beauty, grace, devotion.\nBeauty is of the body, grace is of the heart, and devotion is of the being. And the only disturbance is mind. If mind is silent suddenly your body attains to a beauty which it has never known before. And your heart is full of grace and your being is full of devotion, prayer.\nThese are all manifestations of beauty on different planes. And when all the\nthree are there -- beauty on the physical plane, grace on the heart plane and devotion at the very core of your being -- life becomes a tremendous ecstasy. A great harmony is born in you, and that harmony is our search. That harmony has been called by different names: god, nirvana, enlightenment, tao, truth, but in fact what man is constantly searching for is a state of immense harmony with no discord, so all is functioning in deep attunement within one and also with existence. Then you are no more separate.\nFirst you become an organic unity within yourself, then the second thing happens: you become a part of the whole. And that is the ultimate goal of sannyas, to become harmonious within and without.\n(Fight against the false within you -- this is the message to Anatto Gunar.) We are not one, we are two -- the real and the false. The false has to be defeated so we can become one.\nAnd we can become one only when the real alone is left within and the false has been completely discarded.\nBut the society teaches us hypocrisy. It goes on teaching us manners, etiquette, civilisation, culture; and all these things have to be imposed from the outside. The ultimate result is that you become split. You want one thing but you do something else. You do things according to the expectations of others but your longing is 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- not that.\nFor example you may not feel like smiling, you may be full of tears, but if some guest comes you have to welcome him with a smiling face. Your smile is false, it is a Jimmy Carter smile (laughter). You may show all your teeth but that doesn't make it real -- just an exercise of the lips. There is no heart in it, it is painted: you are full of tears inside. And that's how we are living in every dimension: the false is hiding the real. And the false seems to be more important because it pays and the real is ignored because it creates troubles.\nIf you assert your reality you will be in trouble. It is better to be false and live a comfortable life, Of course it gives you many conveniences, but to live conveniently, comfortably, does not mean that you are living blissfully. And one can never find bliss with a false personality, repressing the real individuality.\nA sannyasin has to come out of the false -- this is the real battle -- because the false has got its roots deep in you. It has become almost unconscious. You will have to dig very deep to uproot it. And that's what my work consists of: helping you to uproot the false, because a man can rejoice only when he is utterly his own self, authentically his own being. Otherwise life remains a misery -- convenient, comfortable, but miserable, sad -- sad because you have not been able to sing your song, sad because you have not danced your dance. You have been dancing to other's tunes; they whistle and you dance.\nThe politicians, the priests, the pedagogues, the parents -- the whole society around you goes on pulling your strings: dance this way. Slowly slowly you start rejecting yourself and accepting what others expect from you.\nA sannyasin has to live according to his own light, whatsoever the cost. In the beginning it is really a struggle, but once you are passionately involved in the battle you are going to win; the victory is absolutely certain. You should not hesitate, because the false cannot win; the false is bound to collapse. You just have to be persistently alert, aware, not to support it any more, not to co-operate with it.\nHumanity up to now has lived in a very stupid way. And that's why as far as I am concerned I don't consider the past of humanity worth anything. Just a few names I respect: a Buddha, a Jesus, a Zarathustra, a Lao Tzu, a Krishna -- just a few names, they can be counted on one's fingers. And the millions have lived only in a false way, pseudo. They have only been carbon copies of carbon copies, of carbon copies, of carbon copies. They don't know where the original is, nobody has heard about the original. They just go on copying some carbon copy.\nYou imitate your parents, your parents were imitating their parents and so on and so forth. Adam was following the dictates of Eve and since that time every Adam is following Eve's dictates. The very beginning went wrong. And Eve herself was not living originally; she had been seduced by the serpent. One does not know who seduced the serpent -- because serpents are not known to be that\nwise. There must have been some other agency behind the serpent. So on and on it goes.\nA sannyasin has to live an original life. He has to discover his original face. This is the real battle, this is the real war. It has to be won, and it can be won.\n(There's a wine that awakens -- Osho tells Anand Denise.) Denise is a beautiful name. It comes from Greek mythology. In Greek mythology Dionysius is the god of wine; Denise comes from Dionysius -- so you have come to the right person (laughter). I am a drunkard and I help people to become drunkards.\nDionysius has completely disappeared because of Christianity. Christianity condemned Dionysius like anything. In ancient Greece he used to have temples of his own, and he was one of the most beautiful of all the gods. What can be more beautiful than the god of wine? But Christians totally missed the point. They thought in a literal way; they could not understand the metaphor. It is a metaphor of tremendous import.\nSufis have also used it: wine represents the ultimate bliss. You become drunk and at the same time you are fully aware, more aware than you have ever been before. That's the miracle of meditation: it brings two polarities together simultaneously. Logically it looks contradictory, but existentially it is not; it is complementary. Meditation brings both into such a heightened synthesis that it is incomprehensible to the mind.\nThe mind can either conceive of somebody utterly drunk and unconscious or somebody fully aware but not drunk. Meditation is paradoxical: you are fully drunk and fully awake. But the wine does not consist of the ordinary wine that you can purchase. It is not a commodity. It is not made out of grapes, it comes out of your own innermost core, it flows from there. It is already there, you just have to find a way to reach there and you will be drunk and awake at the same time -- drunk with the divine. And of course when one is 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\ndrunk with the divine one reaches to the highest peak of awareness. There is\nbliss and there is silence both together. There is dance and yet everything is centred. The circumference dances but the centre is absolutely quiet and calm. To find this centre of the cyclone is the whole process of sannyas.\n(Osho talks to Iris about the difference between mentation and meditation.) Mind is one dimensional and meditation makes you multi-dimensional. Mind can only move in a linear way, on a single track. The name of the track is logic. It cannot feel, it can only think. It cannot experience, it can only think. It cannot act, it can only think. That's why thinkers are inactive people. That has been a calamity in the past because the great thinkers are inactive. They come to beautiful conclusions but those conclusions are impotent because they never act on them. And the fools are very active; they never think.\nSo Adolf Hitlers and Joseph Stalins and Lao Tse Tungs -- these are very active people and these are the fools. So it has been a strange history. The people who think and come to beautiful conclusions go on thinking they never act, so their thinking remains futile, a sheer exercise in futility. And the people who cannot think at all, who have no capacity to think, simply go on acting.\nIn fact Adolf Hitler was winning in the beginning of the Second World War for three years continuously for the simple reason that he was a fool, an idiot. All the generals -- American, British, Russian -- thought logically, wondering what to do with this man, because war is a science and they were moving scientifically and that man was an absolute fool -- he knew nothing about military science. His generals had no say, even they were very much puzzled because he was going against all the rules.\nFor example, the enemy attacks where you are the weakest, the weakest point has to be attacked. That's simple logic, that if you are going to attack some country you attack from the weakest point; there is more surety of winning. Hitler would attack the strongest point. And he went on winning for three years for the simple reason that the others thought logically. So they would collect all their forces at the weakest point and he would attack at the strongest where their military was absent. But after three years of continuously fighting with this fool they became aware of his method or his methodlessness and then they started behaving in a foolish way themselves, then they started winning.\nFools are very active people -- they manage to do things; and thinkers are impotent.\nMeditation is going beyond both; it is going beyond thinking, it is going beyond stupidity. It is moving into a silent, relaxed state. In that state you are open to everything all directions become available, all dimensions are yours; you are not linear. You are simply clear so wherever you look you have clarity. And that's the meaning of being a rainbow -- all the colours, all the seven colours. That means all possibilities should become available.\nA meditator is not a thinker, he is not a fool either; he is beyond both. He acts but he acts out of his multi-dimensionality or he remains inactive, but that too is out of his multi-dimensionality. Sometimes action is good and sometimes inaction is good. Sometimes it is good to say something and sometimes it is better to be silent. The meditator simply allows his spontaneity to take over. He does not force himself into a certain pattern, he has no pattern, he lives naturally. If action is needed it happens, if inaction is needed it happens. And whatsoever happens he goes totally into it. If he is doing something he is doing it totally; if he is not doing he is not doing totally; but he is never half-half, he is never divided. In that undividedness there is great beauty and great power, great insight and great understanding. And out of that insight, understanding, power, clarity, life becomes a piece of art. Then one lives with sensitivity, awareness. And the man who is sensitive and aware in all the dimensions possible can only experience god, because god simply means the whole existence.\nAnd you cannot experience god by being one -- dimensional because god is a totality and you also have to be total to experience totality. You also have to be whole in your smaller way, on a small scale of course, to know the whole. Once you are total you are bridged with the whole.\nIn ancient mythology the rainbow is a bridge between god and man. That is significant. Iris is the name of the god of the rainbow. Iris is the messenger from god to man and from man to god, because the rainbow joins the sky with the earth. It is a bridge, an over-bridge.\nThat mythological idea about the rainbow is beautiful. To me it means that to be multi-dimensional is the only way to be bridged with god. Then this very earth is paradise, then to live herenow is to live in heaven.\n(Addressing a psychologist from Germany Osho points out that modern psychology hasn't yet figured out just what meditation is.)\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nMeditation means a state of no-mind, a state of no-thought, but not a state of sleep.\nThoughts are not there but you are fully conscious and alert, you are just awareness. Of course there is nothing to be aware of. This is one of the most significant things to understand, because modern psychology has a notion that if there is no content then you cannot be aware, you will fall asleep. That is absolutely wrong.\nModern psychology has not yet been able to understand meditation. That's why this wrong idea has persisted for fifty years continuously, for half a century. Psychology says you can be aware only if there are thoughts; if there is nothing to be aware of you cannot be aware. You cannot be simply aware, you need something to be aware of. But they can be logically proved wrong. Existentially, of course, they are wrong.\nI say through my own experience that thoughts disappear and I am still aware. But psychologists will not understand somebody's experience, they will understand only logic. And logically also they are wrong for the simple reason that you can be asleep and thoughts are there, so thoughts are not necessarily part of awareness.\nYou fall asleep, you become unconscious, but thoughts continue as dreams, your mind continues to be active. If the content can be without consciousness why cannot consciousness be without content? It is a simple logic. They are not inevitably together. In sleep consciousness disappears but thoughts continue; in meditation thoughts disappear, consciousness continues. Meditation is just the opposite of sleep.\nAnd Rainer means advice. When you are pure awareness then you need not ask for any advice from anywhere; the advice comes from your very innermost being. You find your inner master. And the outer master is only a help to find the\ninner. The outer master has not to dictate any discipline to you; he has just to give you a few hints so you can search for the inner master. Once you have found your inner source of knowing, seeing, then there is no need for any advice from the scriptures, from the masters -- from any source. You start living according to your light.\nThe real advice comes only from your own being but for that your mind has to go into complete non-functioning, otherwise it is so noisy that you will not be able to hear the very still, small voice within. It is almost a whisper and mind is a maniac, an Ayatollah Khomaniac, and your being speaks in such a whisper that there is no possibility of the mind over hearing it.\nMind is a disturbance. It distracts you from your own source, from your own wisdom. Meditation puts the mind into silence and suddenly for the first time you start hearing inner advice. And the miracle is, it is always right, it is never wrong. So you are never guilty and never feeling repentance. And when each and every step is right your life starts settling into a deep accord.\n(Celebration -- that's sannyas in a nutshell.)\nI don't teach you any philosophy, any dogma, any creed. I simply teach you a blissful way of living moment to moment. I don't ask you to believe in god or in anything else whatsoever. There is no need for any belief. All that is needed is a capacity to rejoice -- and it is there in everybody.\nLife has it intrinsically, it is rot something added to you. It has to be only discovered. Every child is joyous and for the child life is festivity; it is always a celebration. And he celebrates small things. Collecting seashells on the beach how cheerful the child is, as if he has found diamonds. He is just collecting coloured stones or seashells or just making a castle of sand, and he is so absorbed, so totally in it.\nEvery child brings with him the capacity to enjoy, to celebrate, but we destroy it; we make him serious, we make him as serious as possible, as quickly as possible. We are at ease only when he is serious, then we know we have succeeded, then we know that now he is growing up. In fact we have killed something of immense beauty but now we are happy because he is just like us -- serious, sad, moving around with a long face and no has become interested in our stupidities: ambitions, desires, money, power, prestige. And in his whole life\nnow ho will never be so happy as he was before he was destroyed by society.\nMy function is to help you regain that quality again. That's why Jesus says 'Unless you are like small children vou shall not enter into my kingdom of god' -\n- and he is right. A sannyasin has to be a child again.\nErase all that society has done to you, become again a clean slate and start from ABC anew. Let sannyas be a new birth, a new beginning, and you will be surprised that suddenly a great rush of energy comes. And you will see my sannyasins here dancing, rejoicing, singing. Listen! (Osho holds up his hands and pauses in his talk so that the singing from the music group in Buddha Hall is heard more clearly. We laugh, and then he resumes.) They have become children again.\nIf a man can remain a child to the very end of his life, if he can remain a child when he is dying -- even then -- then he has really lived. And then he has really known what life is all about, its wonder, its awe, its 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- mystery.\n(Love and nectar -- that's the meaning of Prem Amritam, Osho tells a German woman.) Amritam: the secret that can make man immortal, has been the search of the alchemists of all the ages.\nIn fact there is no need to search, it is already there. Love is the secret that gives you the first glimpse of immortality, eternity, timelessness, deathlessness. Only in the moments of love does one become aware of the immensity of life, aware that it cannot be contained in the small span that is there between birth and death. It is so vast it cannot be contained in this small life. This life is only one of the expressions. We have been before and we will be after. We have always been here and we are always going to be here.\nLove gives you the first inkling and then from there you can catch hold of the thread and you can start searching. It is love that becomes prayer, it is love that\nbecomes meditation. It is through love that the whole religious quest has arisen. Without love there would have been no religion at all and no Buddha and no Jesus and no Mohammed. It is because of love that people became aware of something transcendental in themselves -- and then the search started. Love triggered a process in man to search beyond the mundane, the ordinary.\nI teach love. Love for love's sake, for no other motive, because any other motive destroys it. Any other motive and love becomes lust. Lust means it has lost its eternity, it has come into the very muddy world. It is no more part of the vast sky.\nLove can either fall and become lust or can rise and become prayer. With motives it falls, with expectations it falls. With no motives, no expectations, it starts rising. It becomes more and more refined; it comes closer and closer to prayer and meditation. At the highest peak of purity love is prayer, love is meditation -- they are two sides of the same coin. And that is the moment one starts feeling the presence of god. That's why Jesus says god is love.\n(Man can operate from his headquarters or his heartspace, Osho tells us.) Living in the noisy mind man functions like an animal or even worse, like a crazy animal. In the silence of the heart man functions like a god or a goddess. The whole question is how to shift your energy from the head to the heart. And it is not difficult. It needs just a decisiveness on your part, because it is your energy --\nyou can withdraw it, you can invest it in a different lifestyle.\nThat's what sannyas is, a different lifestyle. It is living life through the heart, through silence, through love, through bliss. And then god is not somewhere in heaven, then you find him within yourself and of course, within everybody else too. Then even in the rocks he is present, in the trees, in the rivers, mountains.\nThen the whole existence is transformed. It becomes luminous with the presence of god.\n(And more about head and heart to Veet Vivad.)\nMind lives in arguments; it is continuously debating, discussing, doubting. The way to reach the heart is to drop argumentation, to forget all discussions and debates, only then do you start living. Otherwise through all these arguments that mind becomes involved with your energy goes on leaking -- and they never lead\nyou anywhere. The whole history of philosophy is proof, absolute proof, and it should be a reminder to every person that philosophy has not reached a single conclusion. Five thousand years of argumentation and no decision, no conclusion, has been achieved. Even after fifty thousand years there will be no conclusiveness. It is not in the nature of the mind to come to a conclusion, it is against mind's nature.\nAs you come closer to a conclusion it immediately creates new doubts, new questions, and again you are in the same trap. Each single solution brings at least ten more problems and the jungle becomes thicker and thicker.\nThe philosopher lives not, he only thinks, The mystic lives and he lives because he has understood one thing -- that thinking helps not -- so he disappears from the head and he merges into the heart. He starts functioning from the heart. The heart knows love, trust; it is absolutely unaware of doubts, arguments. There are no problems for the heart. The heart knows only solutions and the mind knows only problems. The mind knows only questions and the heart knows only answers. For the mind everything is problematic, for the heart nothing is problematic. Things are mysterious, of course, but not problematic. The heart enjoys the mysteries of life -- and life is full of mysteries. It all depends on you: if you make problems out of mysteries you will waste your life. If you listen to the heart and you approach life as a mystery, not as a problem, then you can live beautifully, gracefully.

diary, which has been scanned and cleaned up. It is for reference
purposes only.]</p><p>(Love needs courage -- that is the meaning of his name, Prem Andreas,
Osho tells the first sannyasin tonight.)</p><p>Love is a potential in man but not an actuality. Everybody is born
with the seed but very few people are capable of transforming it into
reality. That's why you don't see so many joyful people in the world,
blissful people in the world. Everywhere there is great misery,
darkness. People are somehow managing to live but there is no dance, no
song, no music in their lives. They are living life as a curse, not as a
blessing, for the simple reason that they have taken it for granted that
love is a reality. It is not. It has to be realised.</p><p>Of course the potential is there, the possibility is there, the seed
is there, but one</p><p>needs courage to grow it. And why courage? -- because the basic
requirement for love's growth is dropping the idea of the ego.</p><p>Both cannot be together, ego and love. If one remains enclosed in the
ego love remains only a potential, a hope, a promise which is never
going to be fulfilled. If one comes out of the imprisonment of the ego
then suddenly there is great rejoicing in your being, love starts
growing.</p><p>To be in a growing state of love is to be a sannyasin. To realise the
ultimate in love is to be awakened, to be enlightened, to be a Christ or
to be a Buddha.</p><p>(Meditation is a holiday from the mind, Osho tells Dhyan Catherine.)
Otherwise all holidays are false because the mind goes on running. In
fact on holidays it is more crazy because it has all the space, all the
time, to go as insane as possible. On holidays more people go insane,
more people commit suicide, more people murder. There are more accidents
on holidays, of course, because everybody has space and time and
somebody is bound to get into trouble.</p><p>It is good that people are continuously engaged in routine work. The
greatest problem that the future humanity is going to face is when
machines take all the work over and man has seven days holiday per week;
then the real trouble will arise, Then you will see everybody going
berserk; people will not know what to do. And they will do all kinds of
things because the mind is always there racing, running, becoming more
and more speedy.</p><p>When this whole functioning of the mind ceases there is silence. And
in that silence is purity -- that is the meaning of Catherine. Catherine
means purity. To be without mind is to be pure. Mind is a pollution, a
contamination, it is a poisoning process.</p><p>When the mind is put aside you are your natural self, your
spontaneity is there. You have clarity, perspective, vision. And out of
that many things grow. These three qualities are associated with the
name Catherine: beauty, grace, devotion.</p><p>Beauty is of the body, grace is of the heart, and devotion is of the
being. And the only disturbance is mind. If mind is silent suddenly your
body attains to a beauty which it has never known before. And your heart
is full of grace and your being is full of devotion, prayer.</p><p>These are all manifestations of beauty on different planes. And when
all the</p><p>three are there -- beauty on the physical plane, grace on the heart
plane and devotion at the very core of your being -- life becomes a
tremendous ecstasy. A great harmony is born in you, and that harmony is
our search. That harmony has been called by different names: god,
nirvana, enlightenment, tao, truth, but in fact what man is constantly
searching for is a state of immense harmony with no discord, so all is
functioning in deep attunement within one and also with existence. Then
you are no more separate.</p><p>First you become an organic unity within yourself, then the second
thing happens: you become a part of the whole. And that is the ultimate
goal of sannyas, to become harmonious within and without.</p><p>(Fight against the false within you -- this is the message to Anatto
Gunar.) We are not one, we are two -- the real and the false. The false
has to be defeated so we can become one.</p><p>And we can become one only when the real alone is left within and the
false has been completely discarded.</p><p>But the society teaches us hypocrisy. It goes on teaching us manners,
etiquette, civilisation, culture; and all these things have to be
imposed from the outside. The ultimate result is that you become split.
You want one thing but you do something else. You do things according to
the expectations of others but your longing is 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:- not that.</p><p>For example you may not feel like smiling, you may be full of tears,
but if some guest comes you have to welcome him with a smiling face.
Your smile is false, it is a Jimmy Carter smile (laughter). You may show
all your teeth but that doesn't make it real -- just an exercise of the
lips. There is no heart in it, it is painted: you are full of tears
inside. And that's how we are living in every dimension: the false is
hiding the real. And the false seems to be more important because it
pays and the real is ignored because it creates troubles.</p><p>If you assert your reality you will be in trouble. It is better to be
false and live a comfortable life, Of course it gives you many
conveniences, but to live conveniently, comfortably, does not mean that
you are living blissfully. And one can never find bliss with a false
personality, repressing the real individuality.</p><p>A sannyasin has to come out of the false -- this is the real battle
-- because the false has got its roots deep in you. It has become almost
unconscious. You will have to dig very deep to uproot it. And that's
what my work consists of: helping you to uproot the false, because a man
can rejoice only when he is utterly his own self, authentically his own
being. Otherwise life remains a misery -- convenient, comfortable, but
miserable, sad -- sad because you have not been able to sing your song,
sad because you have not danced your dance. You have been dancing to
other's tunes; they whistle and you dance.</p><p>The politicians, the priests, the pedagogues, the parents -- the
whole society around you goes on pulling your strings: dance this way.
Slowly slowly you start rejecting yourself and accepting what others
expect from you.</p><p>A sannyasin has to live according to his own light, whatsoever the
cost. In the beginning it is really a struggle, but once you are
passionately involved in the battle you are going to win; the victory is
absolutely certain. You should not hesitate, because the false cannot
win; the false is bound to collapse. You just have to be persistently
alert, aware, not to support it any more, not to co-operate with it.</p><p>Humanity up to now has lived in a very stupid way. And that's why as
far as I am concerned I don't consider the past of humanity worth
anything. Just a few names I respect: a Buddha, a Jesus, a Zarathustra,
a Lao Tzu, a Krishna -- just a few names, they can be counted on one's
fingers. And the millions have lived only in a false way, pseudo. They
have only been carbon copies of carbon copies, of carbon copies, of
carbon copies. They don't know where the original is, nobody has heard
about the original. They just go on copying some carbon copy.</p><p>You imitate your parents, your parents were imitating their parents
and so on and so forth. Adam was following the dictates of Eve and since
that time every Adam is following Eve's dictates. The very beginning
went wrong. And Eve herself was not living originally; she had been
seduced by the serpent. One does not know who seduced the serpent --
because serpents are not known to be that</p><p>wise. There must have been some other agency behind the serpent. So
on and on it goes.</p><p>A sannyasin has to live an original life. He has to discover his
original face. This is the real battle, this is the real war. It has to
be won, and it can be won.</p><p>(There's a wine that awakens -- Osho tells Anand Denise.) Denise is a
beautiful name. It comes from Greek mythology. In Greek mythology
Dionysius is the god of wine; Denise comes from Dionysius -- so you have
come to the right person (laughter). I am a drunkard and I help people
to become drunkards.</p><p>Dionysius has completely disappeared because of Christianity.
Christianity condemned Dionysius like anything. In ancient Greece he
used to have temples of his own, and he was one of the most beautiful of
all the gods. What can be more beautiful than the god of wine? But
Christians totally missed the point. They thought in a literal way; they
could not understand the metaphor. It is a metaphor of tremendous
import.</p><p>Sufis have also used it: wine represents the ultimate bliss. You
become drunk and at the same time you are fully aware, more aware than
you have ever been before. That's the miracle of meditation: it brings
two polarities together simultaneously. Logically it looks
contradictory, but existentially it is not; it is complementary.
Meditation brings both into such a heightened synthesis that it is
incomprehensible to the mind.</p><p>The mind can either conceive of somebody utterly drunk and
unconscious or somebody fully aware but not drunk. Meditation is
paradoxical: you are fully drunk and fully awake. But the wine does not
consist of the ordinary wine that you can purchase. It is not a
commodity. It is not made out of grapes, it comes out of your own
innermost core, it flows from there. It is already there, you just have
to find a way to reach there and you will be drunk and awake at the same
time -- drunk with the divine. And of course when one is 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>drunk with the divine one reaches to the highest peak of awareness.
There is</p><p>bliss and there is silence both together. There is dance and yet
everything is centred. The circumference dances but the centre is
absolutely quiet and calm. To find this centre of the cyclone is the
whole process of sannyas.</p><p>(Osho talks to Iris about the difference between mentation and
meditation.) Mind is one dimensional and meditation makes you
multi-dimensional. Mind can only move in a linear way, on a single
track. The name of the track is logic. It cannot feel, it can only
think. It cannot experience, it can only think. It cannot act, it can
only think. That's why thinkers are inactive people. That has been a
calamity in the past because the great thinkers are inactive. They come
to beautiful conclusions but those conclusions are impotent because they
never act on them. And the fools are very active; they never think.</p><p>So Adolf Hitlers and Joseph Stalins and Lao Tse Tungs -- these are
very active people and these are the fools. So it has been a strange
history. The people who think and come to beautiful conclusions go on
thinking they never act, so their thinking remains futile, a sheer
exercise in futility. And the people who cannot think at all, who have
no capacity to think, simply go on acting.</p><p>In fact Adolf Hitler was winning in the beginning of the Second World
War for three years continuously for the simple reason that he was a
fool, an idiot. All the generals -- American, British, Russian --
thought logically, wondering what to do with this man, because war is a
science and they were moving scientifically and that man was an absolute
fool -- he knew nothing about military science. His generals had no say,
even they were very much puzzled because he was going against all the
rules.</p><p>For example, the enemy attacks where you are the weakest, the weakest
point has to be attacked. That's simple logic, that if you are going to
attack some country you attack from the weakest point; there is more
surety of winning. Hitler would attack the strongest point. And he went
on winning for three years for the simple reason that the others thought
logically. So they would collect all their forces at the weakest point
and he would attack at the strongest where their military was absent.
But after three years of continuously fighting with this fool they
became aware of his method or his methodlessness and then they started
behaving in a foolish way themselves, then they started winning.</p><p>Fools are very active people -- they manage to do things; and
thinkers are impotent.</p><p>Meditation is going beyond both; it is going beyond thinking, it is
going beyond stupidity. It is moving into a silent, relaxed state. In
that state you are open to everything all directions become available,
all dimensions are yours; you are not linear. You are simply clear so
wherever you look you have clarity. And that's the meaning of being a
rainbow -- all the colours, all the seven colours. That means all
possibilities should become available.</p><p>A meditator is not a thinker, he is not a fool either; he is beyond
both. He acts but he acts out of his multi-dimensionality or he remains
inactive, but that too is out of his multi-dimensionality. Sometimes
action is good and sometimes inaction is good. Sometimes it is good to
say something and sometimes it is better to be silent. The meditator
simply allows his spontaneity to take over. He does not force himself
into a certain pattern, he has no pattern, he lives naturally. If action
is needed it happens, if inaction is needed it happens. And whatsoever
happens he goes totally into it. If he is doing something he is doing it
totally; if he is not doing he is not doing totally; but he is never
half-half, he is never divided. In that undividedness there is great
beauty and great power, great insight and great understanding. And out
of that insight, understanding, power, clarity, life becomes a piece of
art. Then one lives with sensitivity, awareness. And the man who is
sensitive and aware in all the dimensions possible can only experience
god, because god simply means the whole existence.</p><p>And you cannot experience god by being one -- dimensional because god
is a totality and you also have to be total to experience totality. You
also have to be whole in your smaller way, on a small scale of course,
to know the whole. Once you are total you are bridged with the
whole.</p><p>In ancient mythology the rainbow is a bridge between god and man.
That is significant. Iris is the name of the god of the rainbow. Iris is
the messenger from god to man and from man to god, because the rainbow
joins the sky with the earth. It is a bridge, an over-bridge.</p><p>That mythological idea about the rainbow is beautiful. To me it means
that to be multi-dimensional is the only way to be bridged with god.
Then this very earth is paradise, then to live herenow is to live in
heaven.</p><p>(Addressing a psychologist from Germany Osho points out that modern
psychology hasn't yet figured out just what meditation is.)</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>Meditation means a state of no-mind, a state of no-thought, but not a
state of sleep.</p><p>Thoughts are not there but you are fully conscious and alert, you are
just awareness. Of course there is nothing to be aware of. This is one
of the most significant things to understand, because modern psychology
has a notion that if there is no content then you cannot be aware, you
will fall asleep. That is absolutely wrong.</p><p>Modern psychology has not yet been able to understand meditation.
That's why this wrong idea has persisted for fifty years continuously,
for half a century. Psychology says you can be aware only if there are
thoughts; if there is nothing to be aware of you cannot be aware. You
cannot be simply aware, you need something to be aware of. But they can
be logically proved wrong. Existentially, of course, they are wrong.</p><p>I say through my own experience that thoughts disappear and I am
still aware. But psychologists will not understand somebody's
experience, they will understand only logic. And logically also they are
wrong for the simple reason that you can be asleep and thoughts are
there, so thoughts are not necessarily part of awareness.</p><p>You fall asleep, you become unconscious, but thoughts continue as
dreams, your mind continues to be active. If the content can be without
consciousness why cannot consciousness be without content? It is a
simple logic. They are not inevitably together. In sleep consciousness
disappears but thoughts continue; in meditation thoughts disappear,
consciousness continues. Meditation is just the opposite of sleep.</p><p>And Rainer means advice. When you are pure awareness then you need
not ask for any advice from anywhere; the advice comes from your very
innermost being. You find your inner master. And the outer master is
only a help to find the</p><p>inner. The outer master has not to dictate any discipline to you; he
has just to give you a few hints so you can search for the inner master.
Once you have found your inner source of knowing, seeing, then there is
no need for any advice from the scriptures, from the masters -- from any
source. You start living according to your light.</p><p>The real advice comes only from your own being but for that your mind
has to go into complete non-functioning, otherwise it is so noisy that
you will not be able to hear the very still, small voice within. It is
almost a whisper and mind is a maniac, an Ayatollah Khomaniac, and your
being speaks in such a whisper that there is no possibility of the mind
over hearing it.</p><p>Mind is a disturbance. It distracts you from your own source, from
your own wisdom. Meditation puts the mind into silence and suddenly for
the first time you start hearing inner advice. And the miracle is, it is
always right, it is never wrong. So you are never guilty and never
feeling repentance. And when each and every step is right your life
starts settling into a deep accord.</p><p>(Celebration -- that's sannyas in a nutshell.)</p><p>I don't teach you any philosophy, any dogma, any creed. I simply
teach you a blissful way of living moment to moment. I don't ask you to
believe in god or in anything else whatsoever. There is no need for any
belief. All that is needed is a capacity to rejoice -- and it is there
in everybody.</p><p>Life has it intrinsically, it is rot something added to you. It has
to be only discovered. Every child is joyous and for the child life is
festivity; it is always a celebration. And he celebrates small things.
Collecting seashells on the beach how cheerful the child is, as if he
has found diamonds. He is just collecting coloured stones or seashells
or just making a castle of sand, and he is so absorbed, so totally in
it.</p><p>Every child brings with him the capacity to enjoy, to celebrate, but
we destroy it; we make him serious, we make him as serious as possible,
as quickly as possible. We are at ease only when he is serious, then we
know we have succeeded, then we know that now he is growing up. In fact
we have killed something of immense beauty but now we are happy because
he is just like us -- serious, sad, moving around with a long face and
no has become interested in our stupidities: ambitions, desires, money,
power, prestige. And in his whole life</p><p>now ho will never be so happy as he was before he was destroyed by
society.</p><p>My function is to help you regain that quality again. That's why
Jesus says 'Unless you are like small children vou shall not enter into
my kingdom of god' -</p><p>- and he is right. A sannyasin has to be a child again.</p><p>Erase all that society has done to you, become again a clean slate
and start from ABC anew. Let sannyas be a new birth, a new beginning,
and you will be surprised that suddenly a great rush of energy comes.
And you will see my sannyasins here dancing, rejoicing, singing. Listen!
(Osho holds up his hands and pauses in his talk so that the singing from
the music group in Buddha Hall is heard more clearly. We laugh, and then
he resumes.) They have become children again.</p><p>If a man can remain a child to the very end of his life, if he can
remain a child when he is dying -- even then -- then he has really
lived. And then he has really known what life is all about, its wonder,
its awe, its 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-4>Osho's books on

German woman.) Amritam: the secret that can make man immortal, has been
the search of the alchemists of all the ages.</p><p>In fact there is no need to search, it is already there. Love is the
secret that gives you the first glimpse of immortality, eternity,
timelessness, deathlessness. Only in the moments of love does one become
aware of the immensity of life, aware that it cannot be contained in the
small span that is there between birth and death. It is so vast it
cannot be contained in this small life. This life is only one of the
expressions. We have been before and we will be after. We have always
been here and we are always going to be here.</p><p>Love gives you the first inkling and then from there you can catch
hold of the thread and you can start searching. It is love that becomes
prayer, it is love that</p><p>becomes meditation. It is through love that the whole religious quest
has arisen. Without love there would have been no religion at all and no
Buddha and no Jesus and no Mohammed. It is because of love that people
became aware of something transcendental in themselves -- and then the
search started. Love triggered a process in man to search beyond the
mundane, the ordinary.</p><p>I teach love. Love for love's sake, for no other motive, because any
other motive destroys it. Any other motive and love becomes lust. Lust
means it has lost its eternity, it has come into the very muddy world.
It is no more part of the vast sky.</p><p>Love can either fall and become lust or can rise and become prayer.
With motives it falls, with expectations it falls. With no motives, no
expectations, it starts rising. It becomes more and more refined; it
comes closer and closer to prayer and meditation. At the highest peak of
purity love is prayer, love is meditation -- they are two sides of the
same coin. And that is the moment one starts feeling the presence of
god. That's why Jesus says god is love.</p><p>(Man can operate from his headquarters or his heartspace, Osho tells
us.) Living in the noisy mind man functions like an animal or even
worse, like a crazy animal. In the silence of the heart man functions
like a god or a goddess. The whole question is how to shift your energy
from the head to the heart. And it is not difficult. It needs just a
decisiveness on your part, because it is your energy --</p><p>you can withdraw it, you can invest it in a different lifestyle.</p><p>That's what sannyas is, a different lifestyle. It is living life
through the heart, through silence, through love, through bliss. And
then god is not somewhere in heaven, then you find him within yourself
and of course, within everybody else too. Then even in the rocks he is
present, in the trees, in the rivers, mountains.</p><p>Then the whole existence is transformed. It becomes luminous with the
presence of god.</p><p>(And more about head and heart to Veet Vivad.)</p><p>Mind lives in arguments; it is continuously debating, discussing,
doubting. The way to reach the heart is to drop argumentation, to forget
all discussions and debates, only then do you start living. Otherwise
through all these arguments that mind becomes involved with your energy
goes on leaking -- and they never lead</p><p>you anywhere. The whole history of philosophy is proof, absolute
proof, and it should be a reminder to every person that philosophy has
not reached a single conclusion. Five thousand years of argumentation
and no decision, no conclusion, has been achieved. Even after fifty
thousand years there will be no conclusiveness. It is not in the nature
of the mind to come to a conclusion, it is against mind's nature.</p><p>As you come closer to a conclusion it immediately creates new doubts,
new questions, and again you are in the same trap. Each single solution
brings at least ten more problems and the jungle becomes thicker and
thicker.</p><p>The philosopher lives not, he only thinks, The mystic lives and he
lives because he has understood one thing -- that thinking helps not --
so he disappears from the head and he merges into the heart. He starts
functioning from the heart. The heart knows love, trust; it is
absolutely unaware of doubts, arguments. There are no problems for the
heart. The heart knows only solutions and the mind knows only problems.
The mind knows only questions and the heart knows only answers. For the
mind everything is problematic, for the heart nothing is problematic.
Things are mysterious, of course, but not problematic. The heart enjoys
the mysteries of life -- and life is full of mysteries. It all depends
on you: if you make problems out of mysteries you will waste your life.
If you listen to the heart and you approach life as a mystery, not as a
problem, then you can live beautifully, gracefully. And then there is a
possibility of knowing the truth, because the truth is the ultimate
mystery, the mystery of all mysteries.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-5>Osho's books on

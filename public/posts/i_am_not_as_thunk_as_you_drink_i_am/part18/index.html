All prayers fall down --\nthey are futile. But in silence the miracle happens: you have not said a single word, god has not heard a single word but the message is conveyed; you have poured your heart, you have offered your being. That offering is true prayer.\nLearn silence because that is the ultimate language. And only those who know how to be silent become beloveds of god.\n(Osho adds 'Santosh' to 'Toby' and then links the two parts of the name together in his address to the actor from America.)\nMany people cultivate a certain kind of satisfaction, but just below it there is turmoil, just below it there 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nis discontent. It is a facade. They are simply consoling themselves, they are repeating Aesop's fable of the sour grapes. Because they cannot reach anything more than what they have they start saying 'It is not worth reaching for. We are perfectly contented. We don't want money, we don't want power, we don't want prestige.' Not that they don't want those things -- they do -- but they know that they are not strong enough to fight for them all.\nJust to hide their cowardliness, their weakness, they pretend, but that pretension is not real contentment.\nA real contentment arises out of gratitude. God has given you life and you have not thanked him for it.\nHe has given you the capacity to love and you have not thanked him for that. He has given you intelligence to know and you have not thanked him for it. He has given a thousand and one things which we go on accepting as if we deserve them, as if we have a right to have them. We don't have any right. All is a gift. To know that brings a totally different kind of satisfaction. It comes out of gratitude. You feel grateful for so much that has already been done -- you cannot ask for more. Even that which is given to you is more than you are worthy of.\nAnd Toby means god is good. When you start feeling this contentment a tremendous experience happens -- that life is good, that everything is good.\nGod simply means the whole. And to feel that god is good is to be religious. Now there is no complaint, no desire. One is utterly attuned with whatsoever is.\nContentment arises out of gratitude, and out of contentment arises the experience of god's goodness, his unconditional goodness. He gives to us and he asks for nothing in return.\nThis is the way of the sannyasin. (To Beryl Osho adds Dhyan.)\nMeditation is a state of thoughtless awareness: one is fully aware but the mind\nhas ceased to function.\nOrdinarily two things are known to us. One is when the mind is functioning but you are not aware. It goes on functioning, thoughts go on moving, but you are not aware of what is happening inside you. You never witness it, you never watch, you never observe. That's how we all function. This is a state of sleep.\nAnd the second thing is when the mind stops functioning. In deep dreamless sleep the mind stops functioning. It happens almost every night at least for two hours -- in small gaps but the whole time is near about two hours every night, sometimes ten-minute fifteen-minute intervals when you dive deep into sleep.\nEven dreaming stops; dreaming is also a functioning of the mind. But then too you are asleep. When the mind functions you are asleep, that is one state. When the mind does not function you are still asleep, that is another state. These are our ordinary experiences of the so-called waking state and sleep.\nMeditation brings a third state: mind is non- functioning, just as it is in deep dreamless sleep -- that is one part of meditation, the circumference of meditation. And the second part is when you are not asleep, you are fully awake, alert, a flame of witnessing -- that is the centre of meditation. Whenever these two things happen -- you are aware and there is no mind, no thought, no desire, no dream passing through the screen of consciousness -- you attain to ultimate clarity. That is the meaning of Beryl: crystal clear.\nIn that crystal clarity one knows what truth is, what bliss is, what beauty is. And to know it is to have attained the ultimate flowering, to know it is to have come to the highest peak. Then one feels at home, at rest. Now finally there is nowhere to go, nothing to attain. One has arrived.\nWe in the East call it samadhi. Samadhi means a state of ultimate realisation, of truth, beauty, bliss, consciousness, freedom -- of all the higher values.\n(Annamaria from Italy is next.)\nThis is your name: Ma Prem Sujato. Prem means love. Sujato means well-born.\nThe first birth is very ordinary, it is animal. It is nothing peculiar to human beings. Donkeys are born the same way (laughter) monkeys too. Only the second birth makes man special, and the second birth happens through love.\nIn the first birth you come out of the womb of your mother. It was a shelter for nine months, it protected you, but beyond nine months it is dangerous. If a child insists on remaining in that protected, secure space for longer than nine months he will be dead. For nine months it is perfectly beautiful, but then one has to come into the world.\nIn the same way the ego is also a shelter, a protection. In the beginning it is good, but there is a moment when one has to come out of the egg of the ego. That's what love is: dropping the ego.\nOnce you drop the ego and love starts flowing you are twice born. And then you really become a human 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- being.\n(And more about love to Prem Michael.)\nThere are a few things in life which can be called godly. Love is one of those very rare experiences.\nSilence is one of those experiences; awareness, bliss -- these are the windows of our house. We can keep them closed and remain unaware of the beautiful existence beyond, or we can open them.\nThe easiest to open is love. All other windows are far more difficult to open, hence my suggestion is to try to open the window which is the easiest because it is very natural.\nThe desire for awareness is not so natural. It comes only later on at a certain stage of evolution. The desire for freedom is also not immediately available. But love and the desire for love is born with you; hence love can become the key. And once you know how to open one window you know how to open other windows too, then it becomes easy. The art is the same; the method, the technique, is not different.\nStart being more loving. Make it a decision not to miss any opportunity to love. And don't ask others to love you -- that is where people go wrong. Love. If love is returned, good; if it is not returned, then too it is good, because to love is good, to love in itself has an intrinsic beauty. It need not be rewarded. If it is rewarded that is something extra.\nAnd the miracle is that if you don't demand, it is rewarded more and more. If you completely forget any demands it is always rewarded.\nEverybody wants love. But people go wrong: from the very beginning they start asking for love rather than giving it. And the way to get is to give. So give whole-heartedly and don't be a miser, because it is not something quantitative, that by giving you will have less. It belongs to the higher realm where the more you give, the more you have. It is a totally different economics.\n(But bliss is Anand Dwariko's way.)\nBliss is the door to god, so in becoming a sannyasin rejoice, be of great cheer, let the heart dance and sing -- in short, go cuckoo! (laughter) And Italians go cuckoo very easily! I have many Italian cuckoos here (laughter).\nMy sannyasins are not to be sad people. Enough of sadness! Throughout the whole past of humanity we have created sad saints and sages. It has been a nightmare. Now we need cheerful sages, saints who are capable of love and laughter. God is fed up with your old saints. He is continuously informing me not to send any more of the old type of saints. He needs a few dancers in heaven, the singers, lovers -- the old saints have made heaven look like hell. So I am preparing my people.\nOnce my orange people enter heaven they are going to make even the old saints turn on! (laughter) Either those old fools will have to leave or they will have to be ready to be turned on. I am trying to smuggle psychedelic people into heaven! (much laughter) Anand Nandan means a garden of bliss.\nMan can either be a desert or he can be a garden -- both are the possibilities. But millions have chosen to be desertlike. They all wanted to be gardens but something went wrong and instead of becoming gardens they have just become deserts. Unless that basic wrong is put right one can never become a garden. And without becoming a garden -- full of trees, flowers, birds -- life cannot have any meaning, it cannot have any poetry, any music.\nThe most fundamental thing to transform life into a garden is meditation, and meditation is not part of our education at all. Neither the parents nor the schools, colleges or universities teach it, not even the churches, the temples, the mosques\n-- nobody teaches meditation. And it is only through meditation that the transformation happens.\nIf you live your life through the mind you will live in a desert, in a meaningless desert. You will feel bored, tired, exhausted, almost always on the verge of committing suicide or going mad.\nSo my emphasis is on meditation and on nothing else. Learn how to live directly, immediately, not through the mind. Mind can be used as a biocomputer for certain things: for factual memories, for mathematics, geography, history, science. It is a perfectly beautiful computer but you need not live through it, it has to be put aside. When needed you can ask for information but it does not have to be always there.\nWhen you are meeting your girlfriend the computer is there, and there is not only one -- there are two computers between you and your girlfriend. In fact you are hiding behind your computer, she is hiding behind her computer, and those two computers are talking to each other. Now what can happen out of this?\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nI have heard about a psychoanalyst who was a very busy man, so busy that one day he told one of his clients, \"Today I am so busy I have left my tape-recorder here -- just talk to the tape-recorder. Later on at night when I have time I will listen.\" The client said, \"Okay.\"\nWhen the client was leaving he came to the office to say goodbye. He came so quickly -- just within a few minutes -- and it should have been a one-hour session. The psychoanalyst said, \"Where are you going?\"\nThe client said, \"I have left my tape-recorder. In fact I was planning it so I\nbrought it. Whatsoever I was going to say to you I have put onto my tape- recorder. Now my tape-recorder is talking to your tape-recorder. Why waste time? I am also a busy man and you are busy so this is a beautiful method.\nWhenever I have time I will talk to my tape-recorder and whenever you have time you can listen to your tape-recorder. We need not meet again.\"\nBut this is what is happening, actually happening. This is not a joke, this is a reality!\nMeditation simply means coming in direct contact with reality, face to face -- and that immediately transforms the desert into a garden.\nHow long will you be here?\nAt least three weeks but I'll be back.\nCome back. And next time don't bring your tape-recorder!\n(Tonight Osho has talked at length of love and of bliss. Now to a student from Germany he talks of the two together as being her path.)\nFor yourself be blissful, for others be loving. Bliss will take care of your subjectivity, interiority, and love will take care of your external life. And when both are there simultaneously they balance each other, otherwise man becomes lopsided. One has to be constantly balancing between love and bliss. More of love and you become an extrovert, more of bliss and you become an introvert. But when both are balanced, in that balance transcendence happens; you go beyond, beyond the inner and the outer, beyond all dualities.\nAnd that is the target for a sannyasin: to go beyond all dualities -- darkness-light, life-death, matter-mind, this world and that world. One has to go on transcending all dualities.\nWhen all dualities are forgotten, left far behind, then you have come to your ultimate essence. To experience it is to know the truth, and truth liberates.\n(Trish becomes Gyan Arpan -- wisdom, offering.)\nWisdom happens only when you have offered yourself totally, when you are\nsurrendered to the whole, when you relax and drop all your defences, when you withdraw all your boundaries, when you start meeting and merging with the whole like ice melting into the ocean.\nOrdinarily we exist in the ocean like icebergs. We are made of water but we exist like icebergs -- cold, hard -- and we cling to our identities.\nSannyas has only one meaning: the dropping of your ego and its identity, the forgetting of the self so that you can experience the whole. And that very experience brings ecstasy, an ecstasy which is eternal. It comes but it never goes. Once it is there it is forever.\n(In his address to the last sannyasin whom he names Veet Asmito, Osho reiterates the need to drop the ego.)\nEgo can exist in three ways. The grossest exists on the physical plane, like a Mohammed Ali claiming to be the greatest. It is a very gross ego but in a way it is easier to get rid of the gross ego because it is so apparent. It is impossible not to see it, it is just on the surface. The second ego is a little deeper, it is psychological. A painter, a musician, a poet -- these people have a psychological ego. It is far more subtle and also far more difficult to see. From the outside the person may not look egoistic at all, he may seem a very beautiful person, but if you just scratch him a little bit you will find ego exploding.\nAnd the third is the subtlest: the spiritual ego that exists in the so-called saints, mahatmas, yogis, siddhas. The third is so subtle that it wears the garb of humbleness, hence it is very difficult to find.\nThousands of people have lived with it absolutely unaware of its existence and others have worshipped them as humble people, as simple people, as divine, as godly. But if you watch accurately you will see: behind the humbleness there is a desire to claim 'I am the most humble person in the world. Nobody is more humble than me.' It is the ego, the same ego. It has come again but now it has come in such a way that one needs tremendous intelligence to find it.\nAsmito means the third, the subtlest ego. And the sannyasin has to go beyond it. Certainly he has to go 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nbeyond the physical and the psychological, but I want you to be more aware of the subtlest because that is where all the old traditional religious people got lost. It wears the mask of humbleness, simplicity, poverty, meekness.\nThe really egoless person has no humbleness in him, he cannot have. He is neither egoistic nor humble, he is neither proud of anything nor its opposite. Humbleness is nothing but ego standing on its head -- but it is still ego. Whether it is standing on its head or on its feet, it makes no difference. The really egoless person is not egoistic and is not humble either, he is simply whatsoever he is. He claims nothing, not even humbleness.\nJesus says blessed are the meek for theirs is the kingdom of god. Because of such statements Christian saints went wrong. They started cultivating meekness to attain the kingdom of god. Now what kind of meekness is this? It is greed, pure greed, it is an ego-longing to enter the kingdom of god.\nJesus' purpose was totally different. When he said blessed are the meek for theirs is the kingdom of god, he was not talking in terms of cause and effect, he was not saying be meek so that you can attain to the kingdom of god. He was saying that the kingdom of god happens naturally to those who have lost their ego.\nBut he used the wrong word, 'meek'. His meaning is clear but only for those who understand. He simply wants to say 'egoless'; but 'meek' gives a different sense, it becomes humbleness. But humbleness isn't egolessness, it is ego pretending to be humble.\nEgolessness knows nothing of humbleness. For example, I am not a humble man at all. I cannot be humble, there is no way for me to be humble. I am simply the way I am.\nIf one is simply the way one is, if one simply relaxes into one's nature, into one's spontaneity, then that is the kingdom of god. It is not a reward, it is not that you attain it because of your egolessness. To be egoless is it. It is the kingdom of god.\nI Am Not As Thunk As You Drink I Am Chapter #20\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"3165","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/i_am_not_as_thunk_as_you_drink_i_am/part18/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/i_am_not_as_thunk_as_you_drink_i_am/>I Am Not As Thunk As You Drink I Am</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>15 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;3165 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/I_Am_Not_As_Thunk_As_You_Drink_I_Am/part18.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part17>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

him for it. He has given a thousand and one things which we go on
accepting as if we deserve them, as if we have a right to have them. We
don't have any right. All is a gift. To know that brings a totally
different kind of satisfaction. It comes out of gratitude. You feel
grateful for so much that has already been done -- you cannot ask for
more. Even that which is given to you is more than you are worthy
of.</p><p>And Toby means god is good. When you start feeling this contentment a
tremendous experience happens -- that life is good, that everything is
good.</p><p>God simply means the whole. And to feel that god is good is to be
religious. Now there is no complaint, no desire. One is utterly attuned
with whatsoever is.</p><p>Contentment arises out of gratitude, and out of contentment arises
the experience of god's goodness, his unconditional goodness. He gives
to us and he asks for nothing in return.</p><p>This is the way of the sannyasin. (To Beryl Osho adds Dhyan.)</p><p>Meditation is a state of thoughtless awareness: one is fully aware
but the mind</p><p>has ceased to function.</p><p>Ordinarily two things are known to us. One is when the mind is
functioning but you are not aware. It goes on functioning, thoughts go
on moving, but you are not aware of what is happening inside you. You
never witness it, you never watch, you never observe. That's how we all
function. This is a state of sleep.</p><p>And the second thing is when the mind stops functioning. In deep
dreamless sleep the mind stops functioning. It happens almost every
night at least for two hours -- in small gaps but the whole time is near
about two hours every night, sometimes ten-minute fifteen-minute
intervals when you dive deep into sleep.</p><p>Even dreaming stops; dreaming is also a functioning of the mind. But
then too you are asleep. When the mind functions you are asleep, that is
one state. When the mind does not function you are still asleep, that is
another state. These are our ordinary experiences of the so-called
waking state and sleep.</p><p>Meditation brings a third state: mind is non- functioning, just as it
is in deep dreamless sleep -- that is one part of meditation, the
circumference of meditation. And the second part is when you are not
asleep, you are fully awake, alert, a flame of witnessing -- that is the
centre of meditation. Whenever these two things happen -- you are aware
and there is no mind, no thought, no desire, no dream passing through
the screen of consciousness -- you attain to ultimate clarity. That is
the meaning of Beryl: crystal clear.</p><p>In that crystal clarity one knows what truth is, what bliss is, what
beauty is. And to know it is to have attained the ultimate flowering, to
know it is to have come to the highest peak. Then one feels at home, at
rest. Now finally there is nowhere to go, nothing to attain. One has
arrived.</p><p>We in the East call it samadhi. Samadhi means a state of ultimate
realisation, of truth, beauty, bliss, consciousness, freedom -- of all
the higher values.</p><p>(Annamaria from Italy is next.)</p><p>This is your name: Ma Prem Sujato. Prem means love. Sujato means
well-born.</p><p>The first birth is very ordinary, it is animal. It is nothing
peculiar to human beings. Donkeys are born the same way (laughter)
monkeys too. Only the second birth makes man special, and the second
birth happens through love.</p><p>In the first birth you come out of the womb of your mother. It was a
shelter for nine months, it protected you, but beyond nine months it is
dangerous. If a child insists on remaining in that protected, secure
space for longer than nine months he will be dead. For nine months it is
perfectly beautiful, but then one has to come into the world.</p><p>In the same way the ego is also a shelter, a protection. In the
beginning it is good, but there is a moment when one has to come out of
the egg of the ego. That's what love is: dropping the ego.</p><p>Once you drop the ego and love starts flowing you are twice born. And
then you really become a human 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on

of those very rare experiences.</p><p>Silence is one of those experiences; awareness, bliss -- these are
the windows of our house. We can keep them closed and remain unaware of
the beautiful existence beyond, or we can open them.</p><p>The easiest to open is love. All other windows are far more difficult
to open, hence my suggestion is to try to open the window which is the
easiest because it is very natural.</p><p>The desire for awareness is not so natural. It comes only later on at
a certain stage of evolution. The desire for freedom is also not
immediately available. But love and the desire for love is born with
you; hence love can become the key. And once you know how to open one
window you know how to open other windows too, then it becomes easy. The
art is the same; the method, the technique, is not different.</p><p>Start being more loving. Make it a decision not to miss any
opportunity to love. And don't ask others to love you -- that is where
people go wrong. Love. If love is returned, good; if it is not returned,
then too it is good, because to love is good, to love in itself has an
intrinsic beauty. It need not be rewarded. If it is rewarded that is
something extra.</p><p>And the miracle is that if you don't demand, it is rewarded more and
more. If you completely forget any demands it is always rewarded.</p><p>Everybody wants love. But people go wrong: from the very beginning
they start asking for love rather than giving it. And the way to get is
to give. So give whole-heartedly and don't be a miser, because it is not
something quantitative, that by giving you will have less. It belongs to
the higher realm where the more you give, the more you have. It is a
totally different economics.</p><p>(But <em>bliss</em> is Anand Dwariko's way.)</p><p>Bliss is the door to god, so in becoming a sannyasin rejoice, be of
great cheer, let the heart dance and sing -- in short, go cuckoo!
(laughter) And Italians go cuckoo very easily! I have many Italian
cuckoos here (laughter).</p><p>My sannyasins are not to be sad people. Enough of sadness! Throughout
the whole past of humanity we have created sad saints and sages. It has
been a nightmare. Now we need cheerful sages, saints who are capable of
love and laughter. God is fed up with your old saints. He is
continuously informing me not to send any more of the old type of
saints. He needs a few dancers in heaven, the singers, lovers -- the old
saints have made heaven look like hell. So I am preparing my people.</p><p>Once my orange people enter heaven they are going to make even the
old saints turn on! (laughter) Either those old fools will have to leave
or they will have to be ready to be turned on. I am trying to smuggle
psychedelic people into heaven! (much laughter) Anand Nandan means a
garden of bliss.</p><p>Man can either be a desert or he can be a garden -- both are the
possibilities. But millions have chosen to be desertlike. They all
wanted to be gardens but something went wrong and instead of becoming
gardens they have just become deserts. Unless that basic wrong is put
right one can never become a garden. And without becoming a garden --
full of trees, flowers, birds -- life cannot have any meaning, it cannot
have any poetry, any music.</p><p>The most fundamental thing to transform life into a garden is
meditation, and meditation is not part of our education at all. Neither
the parents nor the schools, colleges or universities teach it, not even
the churches, the temples, the mosques</p><p>-- nobody teaches meditation. And it is only through meditation that
the transformation happens.</p><p>If you live your life through the mind you will live in a desert, in
a meaningless desert. You will feel bored, tired, exhausted, almost
always on the verge of committing suicide or going mad.</p><p>So my emphasis is on meditation and on nothing else. Learn how to
live directly, immediately, not through the mind. Mind can be used as a
biocomputer for certain things: for factual memories, for mathematics,
geography, history, science. It is a perfectly beautiful computer but
you need not live through it, it has to be put aside. When needed you
can ask for information but it does not have to be always there.</p><p>When you are meeting your girlfriend the computer is there, and there
is not only one -- there are two computers between you and your
girlfriend. In fact you are hiding behind your computer, she is hiding
behind her computer, and those two computers are talking to each other.
Now what can happen out of this?</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on

that one day he told one of his clients, "Today I am so busy I have left
my tape-recorder here -- just talk to the tape-recorder. Later on at
night when I have time I will listen." The client said, "Okay."</p><p>When the client was leaving he came to the office to say goodbye. He
came so quickly -- just within a few minutes -- and it should have been
a one-hour session. The psychoanalyst said, "Where are you going?"</p><p>The client said, "I have left my tape-recorder. In fact I was
planning it so I</p><p>brought it. Whatsoever I was going to say to you I have put onto my
tape- recorder. Now my tape-recorder is talking to your tape-recorder.
Why waste time? I am also a busy man and you are busy so this is a
beautiful method.</p><p>Whenever I have time I will talk to my tape-recorder and whenever
<em>you</em> have time you can listen to your tape-recorder. We need not
meet again."</p><p>But this is what is happening, actually happening. This is not a
joke, this is a reality!</p><p>Meditation simply means coming in direct contact with reality, face
to face -- and that immediately transforms the desert into a garden.</p><p>How long will you be here?</p><p>At least three weeks but I'll be back.</p><p>Come back. And next time don't bring your tape-recorder!</p><p>(Tonight Osho has talked at length of love and of bliss. Now to a
student from Germany he talks of the two together as being her
path.)</p><p>For yourself be blissful, for others be loving. Bliss will take care
of your subjectivity, interiority, and love will take care of your
external life. And when both are there simultaneously they balance each
other, otherwise man becomes lopsided. One has to be constantly
balancing between love and bliss. More of love and you become an
extrovert, more of bliss and you become an introvert. But when both are
balanced, in that balance transcendence happens; you go beyond, beyond
the inner and the outer, beyond all dualities.</p><p>And that is the target for a sannyasin: to go beyond all dualities --
darkness-light, life-death, matter-mind, this world and that world. One
has to go on transcending all dualities.</p><p>When all dualities are forgotten, left far behind, then you have come
to your ultimate essence. To experience it is to know the truth, and
truth liberates.</p><p>(Trish becomes Gyan Arpan -- wisdom, offering.)</p><p>Wisdom happens only when you have offered yourself totally, when you
are</p><p>surrendered to the whole, when you relax and drop all your defences,
when you withdraw all your boundaries, when you start meeting and
merging with the whole like ice melting into the ocean.</p><p>Ordinarily we exist in the ocean like icebergs. We are made of water
but we exist like icebergs -- cold, hard -- and we cling to our
identities.</p><p>Sannyas has only one meaning: the dropping of your ego and its
identity, the forgetting of the self so that you can experience the
whole. And that very experience brings ecstasy, an ecstasy which is
eternal. It comes but it never goes. Once it is there it is forever.</p><p>(In his address to the last sannyasin whom he names Veet Asmito, Osho
reiterates the need to drop the ego.)</p><p>Ego can exist in three ways. The grossest exists on the physical
plane, like a Mohammed Ali claiming to be the greatest. It is a very
gross ego but in a way it is easier to get rid of the gross ego because
it is so apparent. It is impossible not to see it, it is just on the
surface. The second ego is a little deeper, it is psychological. A
painter, a musician, a poet -- these people have a psychological ego. It
is far more subtle and also far more difficult to see. From the outside
the person may not look egoistic at all, he may seem a very beautiful
person, but if you just scratch him a little bit you will find ego
exploding.</p><p>And the third is the subtlest: the spiritual ego that exists in the
so-called saints, mahatmas, yogis, siddhas. The third is so subtle that
it wears the garb of humbleness, hence it is very difficult to find.</p><p>Thousands of people have lived with it absolutely unaware of its
existence and others have worshipped them as humble people, as simple
people, as divine, as godly. But if you watch accurately you will see:
behind the humbleness there is a desire to claim 'I am the most humble
person in the world. Nobody is more humble than me.' It is the ego, the
same ego. It has come again but now it has come in such a way that one
needs tremendous intelligence to find it.</p><p>Asmito means the third, the subtlest ego. And the sannyasin has to go
beyond it. Certainly he has to go 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>beyond the physical and the psychological, but I want you to be more
aware of the subtlest because that is where all the old traditional
religious people got lost. It wears the mask of humbleness, simplicity,
poverty, meekness.</p><p>The really egoless person has no humbleness in him, he cannot have.
He is neither egoistic nor humble, he is neither proud of anything nor
its opposite. Humbleness is nothing but ego standing on its head -- but
it is still ego. Whether it is standing on its head or on its feet, it
makes no difference. The really egoless person is not egoistic and is
not humble either, he is simply whatsoever he is. He claims nothing, not
even humbleness.</p><p>Jesus says blessed are the meek for theirs is the kingdom of god.
Because of such statements Christian saints went wrong. They started
cultivating meekness to attain the kingdom of god. Now what kind of
meekness is this? It is greed, pure greed, it is an ego-longing to enter
the kingdom of god.</p><p>Jesus' purpose was totally different. When he said blessed are the
meek for theirs is the kingdom of god, he was not talking in terms of
cause and effect, he was not saying be meek so that you can attain to
the kingdom of god. He was saying that the kingdom of god happens
naturally to those who have lost their ego.</p><p>But he used the wrong word, 'meek'. His meaning is clear but only for
those who understand. He simply wants to say 'egoless'; but 'meek' gives
a different sense, it becomes humbleness. But humbleness isn't
egolessness, it is ego pretending to be humble.</p><p>Egolessness knows nothing of humbleness. For example, I am not a
humble man at all. I cannot be humble, there is no way for me to be
humble. I am simply the way I am.</p><p>If one is simply the way one is, if one simply relaxes into one's
nature, into one's spontaneity, then that is the kingdom of god. It is
not a reward, it is not that you attain it because of your egolessness.
To be egoless <em>is</em> it. It is the kingdom of god.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:justify id=i-am-not-as-thunk-as-you-drink-i-am>I Am Not As Thunk As You Drink

It is for reference purposes only.]\n(A musician from Denmark, Martin becomes a divine warrior.) The sannyasin is a divine warrior. He does not fight for anything worldly, his fight is with his inner darkness. He fights for light, for consciousness, for enlightenment -- neither for power nor prestige nor money. He fights to realise his potential because that is the only way to know god.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThe moment you have realised your potential god is revealed. And unless you know god -- and by 'god' I mean the whole, the essential core of existence -- unless we know it our life remains a hell. Knowing it transforms hell into heaven. Everything remains the same but we are transformed, our vision is transformed.\n(John is a freelance writer and an opera singer. Osho reminds him, in explaining the meaning of Dhyan John, that meditation is the most valuable of all the gifts God bestows on us.) Even life is not more valuable than meditation. Love is there, bliss is there, beauty is there, but meditation is the highest gift. It is the greatest gift for the simple reason that if meditation happens then all else happens of its own accord. With meditation you become really alive, you are born anew. You become flooded with bliss, you become simply loving for no motive. Your life becomes radiant, it starts having the quality of godliness. It blooms; the flower of your being opens and the fragrance, the imprisoned splendor, is released. But it all happens through meditation. So there are many gifts but nothing compared to the gift of meditation.\nIt is a gift, remember; it is not an achievement. But also remember that one has to prepare oneself to receive the gift. That is your achievement -- preparation. Without the preparation the gift will not reach you.\nEven if it comes you will not be able to recognize it. It may have already come but you will have ignored it.\nUnless you are ready to receive it -- alert, aware, watching, waiting prayerfully -- you will go on missing it. So there are two parts in meditation. The first part is your achievement. That means creating a quiet, silent mind, creating a space within you -- it is too full of junk -- throwing all the junk outside, making yourself spacious inside. That is your achievement. And whenever you have done it the gift comes. That is the second part of meditation.\nThe first part is man's achievement, the second part is a gift from God. Those who have done the first part become ready to receive the second part. That's why it is said that meditation is an effortless effort.\nWhen one hears it for the first time it looks like an absolute contradiction: \"effortless effort?\" It is effort and yet effortless. The first part is effort and the second part is effortless.\nSo one has to do much, remembering always that all this doing is only preparing the ground, and then when the ground is ready one has to wait. Wait for the right moment, because there is never any injustice in existence. Whenever your readiness has come to the right point, to the right degree, immediately the gift arrives; instantaneously it arrives.\n(Ib is the father of Danish sannyasin, Lena. Osho explains the origin of his name as derived from two sources. In Welsh it comes from Ivor, which means god or lord, and in Hebrew it comes from Abraham.) The Hebrew Abraham becomes Ibrahim in Arabic and Ib is the first part of Ibrahim. Ibrahim is the ancientmost religious person in the Judaic tradition, hence he is called the father. He founded the first mystery school, the first religious tradition in the West.\nBoth meanings are beautiful. Ibrahim is the first prophet of god, and one can be a prophet of god only if one has realised god. Unless one becomes god himself one cannot be a prophet. Unless one becomes one with the divine one cannot deliver the message of the divine. Only in that oneness does the message start flowing.\nYour name will mean bliss is god, or godliness to be more precise, to be more exact. The quality that comes closest to god is bliss. Love also comes very close because of bliss -- because love creates bliss.\nMeditation also comes very close but because of bliss. Beauty also comes very close but because of bliss. If we look at all the doors of the temple of god they are very different -- the door called love, the door called meditation, the door called beauty. The poet enters from the door of beauty. Any creater -- painter, musician, sculptor -- enters from the door of creativity.\nBut one thing is common and that is bliss. Whether you are a painter or a poet or a dancer or a musician, whether you are a meditator or a lover, whether you practise yoga or zen, it does not matter, one thing is essential: whatsoever you are doing, its centre, the axle, always remains bliss. The wheel may be different but the wheel is not significant. The unchanging axle is significant and that is always bliss.\nThe poet finds it in poetry, the painter in painting, the meditator in meditation, the lover in love, but it is always bliss. Hence bliss is syonymous with godliness. To become absolutely blissful is to become divine.\nHence I don't teach renunciation; I teach rejoicing. Rejoice more and more because only when you are throbbing with joy do you ride on that wave of bliss and start coming closer to god. When the wave of bliss is a tidal wave it can land you on the farther shore, the ultimate truth, god, nirvana or whatsoever one may choose to call it. But it is always the tidal wave of bliss that takes you to the\nfarther shore. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\n(Osho has fun with Diotama's name. He even mentions it again in discourse the following morning!) Dhyano means meditation. Diotama has two meanings. The first is very beautiful. It means priestess of love, but the second is just far out! (laughter) The second means a jar with a neck and two handles. That's what a woman really is! (much laughter) That is the actual meaning, but through meditation the second meaning is possible: the jar with a neck and two handles can become a priestess of love, because meditation is an alchemical process. It transforms the lowest into the highest.\nBut ninety-nine point nine per cent of women remain with the first meaning; they never reach the second. Becoming a sannyasin means now the second meaning has to be enquired into, realised. It is potentially there. And whenever a woman becomes self-realised her realisation is more full of love than any man's can ever be.\nWhenever a man achieves the ultimate he calls it truth. Whenever a woman has achieved the ultimate it has always been known as love; that is the woman's approach. But it is the same experience. Truth seems to be a little dry, desert- like; love is an oasis. Love is full of song, joy, dance and celebration.\nMillions of woman have missed for the simple reason that they have been following Jesus, Buddha, Zarathustra, Lao Tzu -- and they all talk about truth, obviously. Their very language is male-oriented, and to a woman the very word 'truth' falls flat; it has no meaning. Just utter the word 'love' and suddenly a bell starts ringing in the heart of a woman. Because all the founders of the great religions were men, women have missed.\nMy effort here is to put the balance right. I would like many woman sannyasins\nto become enlightened\n-- this will be happening for the first time -- so that the other approach also becomes very clear. Women need not go on following something which does not fit with their deepest longing, which remains a little distant.\nI don't feel truth can ever be very close to a woman; some distance will remain. She can try to reach it --\nand many women have tried and a few of them have even reached to the ultimate peak. But they remain secondary, they are bound to. They cannot compete with a Buddha. Even if they realise truth, even after their realisation, their expression will remain very ordinary compared to Buddha, because what he has found fits with his whole being. And for a woman truth remains a little bit alien, strange. Only love can release the woman and her energies.\nSo here I am trying to give men their methods and to woman, a totally different approach. Yes, there are a few men who would like to move through love and there are a few women who would like to move through truth. Those are exceptions, they need not be counted; they only prove the rule.\nSo whenever a man becomes realised he becomes s Gautam Buddha, he becomes a prophet of truth, but whenever a woman achieves she is bound to become a priestess of love.\nDiotama is a beautiful name, but remember both meanings! The first has to be changed and the second has to be achieved.\n(Ingrid becomes Prem Sugandho -- love fragrance.)\nLove is more like fragrance than like a flower. A flower has a form -- but every form gives a limitation and love is unlimited, hence it can't have any form.\nThe flower has colour, the fragrance is colourless. Every colour makes you one- dimensional, but colourlessness makes you multi-dimensional. And love, to be truly love, has to be formless, unlimited, multi-dimensional. If it is linear it becomes lust; if it is multi-dimensional, it becomes prayer. It is the same energy\n-- love. The lowest it can fall is lust and the highest it can rise is prayer.\nThe energy is not different, it is the same ladder. Lust is the lowest rung and prayer is the highest rung.\nThe name of the ladder is love; it is all the rungs from the lowest to the highest. That's what I mean when I say it is multi-dimensional, formless.\nBut because of our unawareness we try to give it a form, a colour, a shape, a limit. We try to create a boundary, and the more we succeed in doing this, the more love is going to disappear, it will die. It has to be a bird on the wing, in the sky -- you cannot encage it. Even if you make a golden cage you will kill the bird.\nThe bird in the cage and the bird in the open sky are not the same; they are two different phenomena.\nThey look alike but the bird on the wing, in the winds, in the clouds, has freedom, and because of freedom it has bliss. The bird in the cage only looks formally the same but it has no sky, no freedom, no bliss. And birds don't bother much about whether the cage is made of gold or iron, whether it is studded with diamonds or just a poor thing -- it does not matter. These foolish things matter only to man.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nWords like 'diamond' and 'gold' are human inventions; to birds they don't mean anything. What matters is freedom, and that is destroyed. Love is a bird and it loves to be free. It needs the whole sky to grow.\nSo remember never to encage it, never to imprison it, never to give it a limit and a form, a shape, a name, an address, a label -- never. Just let it remain a fragrance, invisible, and then it can take you on its wings to the ultimate.\n(An indicator as to his path is Ed's new name, Sagarprem. It means love for the oceanic, for the unbounded.)\nAnything that has a boundary will imprison you. All boundaries have to be transcended, surpassed.\nWhen you have come to a point where no boundary to your being exists, when you simply are without any definition -- neither Hindu nor Christian nor Mohammedan, neither German nor American nor Canadian, neither black nor white, neither man nor woman, neither communist nor fascists... when you have transcended all these boundaries of the body and the mind you enter an oceanic world. And that's the search of sannyas: to go on surpassing till nothing is left to surpass, only then know that you have come home.\nBefore that everything is a caravanserai. You can stay to rest but don't cling to anything, nothing is your home, just an overnight stay and remember in the morning you have to go.\nSo, there is no need to cling, no need to become attached to anything. Remain unattached so that your flow is not hindered. Remain like a river. It passes through many many territories. In the mountains it comes from the Himalayan peaks, it passes virgin snow. If it clings it will remain there. And it is beautiful -- those virgin peaks, that virgin snow has a purity, an innocence, a beauty. But the river moves. It passes through many beautiful valleys, mountains, forests but it goes on moving. It passes through many beautiful scenes but without clinging; it goes on and on till it reaches the ocean.\nBe like a river -- flowing, never getting attached, otherwise you will become a pond. And a pond can never reach the ocean, only a river can. So remain open- ended and go on flowing. If one can continue to flow one has understood the meaning of sannyas. If one can remain a river in life one has experienced the innermost core of sannyas. Then the ocean is not far away. Howsoever far away it is, it is not far away.\n(To a psychology teacher Osho gives the name Prem Sugatha.) Prem means love. Sugatha means a beautiful story. Life can either be a tragi dy or it can be a beautiful love story. Either it can be just a series of miseries, nightmares or it can be just a continuum of celebration.\nIt all depends on us , what we make out of it. It is an empty canvas. We have to paint it. We can make a monster on the canvas and can become frightened by it or we can create a beautiful sunset or flowers and we can be enchanted by it.\nRemember: man comes into the world as an empty canvas. God does not give any programme to you, you are not programmed. There is nothing like fate; it is\nthe invention of the cowards, it is the invention of people who don't want to make anything out of their life -- who are so lazy, so cowardly, that they don't want to take any risk. They throw the whole responsibility on god. They call it fate, kismet, karma and thousands of names, but all are basically tricks to avoid the responsibility that 'My life is my responsibility.\nWhatsoever I am I have made it that way and whatsoever I am going to be tomorrow I am creating today.\nNothing can be done about yesterday; there is no need to bother about it, it is finished. But today is still available and out of today all the tomorrows will be coming. And if one is alert just a small touch can change the whole story.\nTwo small boys were talking; one boy was the son of a great painter. He said 'My father is such a great artist. Just the other day I was watching him painting. He painted a picture and the man was looking so miserable that I said to him \"Father, why are you making him so miserable?\" He said \"Okay, I will change it.\" And with just one stroke of his brush the man started smiling!' And the other boy said 'That's nothing, my mother does it every day: without even having a paintbrush, just one stroke and she can make me cry or weep. That's nothing much. Not even a stroke, just the way she looks is enough.'\nWe are absolutely responsible for whatsoever we are. By becoming a sannyasin this is the first thing to accept, that 'Whatsoever I am is my responsibility.' But in it there is freedom. In the beginning it hurts because the ego feels badly shattered: 'Is it my own responsibility? So I have made this whole mess, this whole chaos that I am?' It hurts the ego, but if we understand it then it can become the beginning of a new life. And just a few strokes and the sad face can become a smiling face. Just a few strokes, just little bits of changes here and there and the ugly painting can become a beautiful painting.\nSannyas is the art of painting rightly, meditatively, so that life can be a continuously growing love, bliss, 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\ndance. Unless it becomes the very crescendo of joy, one has failed. But it can become so because death is not the end of life but the highest peak of life, the very summum bonum of life. In a single moment of death the person tells his whole story, whether he has lived authentically or inauthentically, whether he has lived lovingly or violently, whether he has lived out of silence or has been just insane. The moment of death expresses his whole life condensed. And we have to prepare for that moment.\nBut whatsoever we have to do has to be done today, because yesterday is no more and tomorrow has not come yet.\nAll that is available to us is today, but today is enough.\n(Change your orientation from accumulation to transformation, Osho tells Anandgyan.) Change only one thing, change from misery to bliss. from sadness to celebration. And it can be done very easily because misery is an unnatural thing.\nWe are making such a hard effort to remain miserable. People don't see it. When they do they will laugh at the whole ridiculousness of what they have been doing to themselves. They are really doing great work to create misery in every possible way. They don't miss a single opportunity; they jump upon anything that can make thorn miserable.\nThis approach has to be changed. And life gives both opportunities to you. It gives you the day, it gives you the night, it gives you the thorns and the roses, it gives you both opportunities. And it is always balanced, it is always fifty-fifty; it depends on you what you choose. And the miracle is that if you choose the thorns sooner or later you will find there are no flowers because your mind will become accustomed only to thorns. You will only be able to see thorns, you will miss the flowers; you will simply not take any note of them. And the person who chooses flowers, the same happens to him: he starts forgetting about thorns, he takes no note of them. His approach becomes so positive and so affirmative that his whole arithmetic is different.\nThere are people who have invented the saying that every dark cloud has a silver lining, and there are people who say that every silver lining has a dark cloud to it. Both are right. I am not saying that any one person is right and the other is wrong; both are right. But the problem arises of what it is going to give to you.\nThere are people who think there is only one day between two nights and there are people who think there is only one night between two days. Both are right; so far as being right is concerned there is no problem, but what is it going to do to you? If you think in a negative way then your life will be a misery and how can a miserable person be religious? What has he to thank god for? Only a blissful person can be religious because he has so much to thank god for. Every day flowers go on showering on him.\nI have heard about a very beautiful rabbi who fell from a one-hundred-storey building. The rabbi was well-known; all over the building everybody knew him. And people looked from their windows and they asked 'How are you' And he said 'So far, so good!' He went on falling, saying 'So far, so good!'\nThat is the right thing so far, so good. And who cares what is going to happen next? -- if it is going to happen it is going to happen. But the man who can say 'So far, so good,' till the very end, his end will also be totally different because it will be the accumulation of his whole approach. It cannot come from nowhere, it comes from his being: his death will also be beautiful.\n(Osho names Erik, Swami Raidas after an Indian mystic. Although he was of the same calibre as Buddha, Nanak and Kabir, he is not so well known, Osho explains, because he was poor; in fact he was an illiterate cobbler.)\nIn India to be a cobbler means to be an untouchable.\nThat is one of the greatest misfortunes that has happened to India; almost one- third of the population is rejected, as if they are not human beings. They are living not as part of society but as outsiders, on the fringes. They are not even allowed to live in the villages; they have to live outside the villages.\nFor centuries these poor untouchables were not allowed to drink from the same well as the whole village drank from. They were not allowed to move on certain streets, they were not allowed to come into the villages in the daylight, or if they had to they had to declare that they were coming -- 'Please move yourself away' -\n- because even their shadow was thought to be evil. If their shadow fell on you you had to take a bath to purify yourself. This is the ugliest thing that India has done.\nRaidas belonged to those poor people, hence he never became famous -- there was no possibility. But he was of the same status as Buddha, Krishna, Mahavira.\nHis statements are very simple, that of an illiterate 1/08/07 Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nperson, but very straightforward too, very clear-cut -- no philosophising, no going round and round in circles.\nHis statements are few but they go direct, like an arrow, and simply hit your heart. He used to sing and dance his songs. Whosoever was courageous enough to come to him would come.\nThis man, Raidas, had only one message and that was: if you can dance and sing totally, forgetting yourself, lost in the dance and the song, you have entered into god. And that's my message too. Dropping the ego by any strategy is enough. The moment you drop the ego, the moment you forget yourself... Not that you become unconscious or you fall into a coma, it is simply that self-consciousness is no more there.\nConsciousness is there more than ever but there is no self, no ego. In that very moment the meeting with god happens.\nSo his whole message was to dance so totally, to sing so totally, that the ego could be forgotten and you would enter into god. There is no need to go to the temple, he said, there is no need to worship any idol, there is no need to perform any ritual; do only one thing: whatsoever you are doing do it so totally that you are immersed in it.

sannyasin is a divine warrior. He does not fight for anything worldly,
his fight is with his inner darkness. He fights for light, for
consciousness, for enlightenment -- neither for power nor prestige nor
money. He fights to realise his potential because that is the only way
to know god.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished>Osho's books on

unless you know god -- and by 'god' I mean the whole, the essential core
of existence -- unless we know it our life remains a hell. Knowing it
transforms hell into heaven. Everything remains the same but we are
transformed, our vision is transformed.</p><p>(John is a freelance writer and an opera singer. Osho reminds him, in
explaining the meaning of Dhyan John, that meditation is the most
valuable of all the gifts God bestows on us.) Even life is not more
valuable than meditation. Love is there, bliss is there, beauty is
there, but meditation is the highest gift. It is the greatest gift for
the simple reason that if meditation happens then all else happens of
its own accord. With meditation you become really alive, you are born
anew. You become flooded with bliss, you become simply loving for no
motive. Your life becomes radiant, it starts having the quality of
godliness. It blooms; the flower of your being opens and the fragrance,
the imprisoned splendor, is released. But it all happens through
meditation. So there are many gifts but nothing compared to the gift of
meditation.</p><p>It is a gift, remember; it is not an achievement. But also remember
that one has to prepare oneself to receive the gift. That is your
achievement -- preparation. Without the preparation the gift will not
reach you.</p><p>Even if it comes you will not be able to recognize it. It may have
already come but you will have ignored it.</p><p>Unless you are ready to receive it -- alert, aware, watching, waiting
prayerfully -- you will go on missing it. So there are two parts in
meditation. The first part is your achievement. That means creating a
quiet, silent mind, creating a space within you -- it is too full of
junk -- throwing all the junk outside, making yourself spacious inside.
That is your achievement. And whenever you have done it the gift comes.
That is the second part of meditation.</p><p>The first part is man's achievement, the second part is a gift from
God. Those who have done the first part become ready to receive the
second part. That's why it is said that meditation is an effortless
effort.</p><p>When one hears it for the first time it looks like an absolute
contradiction: "effortless effort?" It is effort and yet effortless. The
first part is effort and the second part is effortless.</p><p>So one has to do much, remembering always that all this doing is only
preparing the ground, and then when the ground is ready one has to wait.
Wait for the right moment, because there is never any injustice in
existence. Whenever your readiness has come to the right point, to the
right degree, immediately the gift arrives; instantaneously it
arrives.</p><p>(Ib is the father of Danish sannyasin, Lena. Osho explains the origin
of his name as derived from two sources. In Welsh it comes from Ivor,
which means god or lord, and in Hebrew it comes from Abraham.) The
Hebrew Abraham becomes Ibrahim in Arabic and Ib is the first part of
Ibrahim. Ibrahim is the ancientmost religious person in the Judaic
tradition, hence he is called the father. He founded the first mystery
school, the first religious tradition in the West.</p><p>Both meanings are beautiful. Ibrahim is the first prophet of god, and
one can be a prophet of god only if one has realised god. Unless one
becomes god himself one cannot be a prophet. Unless one becomes one with
the divine one cannot deliver the message of the divine. Only in that
oneness does the message start flowing.</p><p>Your name will mean bliss is god, or godliness to be more precise, to
be more exact. The quality that comes closest to god is bliss. Love also
comes very close <em>because</em> of bliss -- because love creates
bliss.</p><p>Meditation also comes very close but because of bliss. Beauty also
comes very close but because of bliss. If we look at all the doors of
the temple of god they are very different -- the door called love, the
door called meditation, the door called beauty. The poet enters from the
door of beauty. Any creater -- painter, musician, sculptor -- enters
from the door of creativity.</p><p>But one thing is common and that is bliss. Whether you are a painter
or a poet or a dancer or a musician, whether you are a meditator or a
lover, whether you practise yoga or zen, it does not matter, one thing
is essential: whatsoever you are doing, its centre, the axle, always
remains bliss. The wheel may be different but the wheel is not
significant. The unchanging axle is significant and that is always
bliss.</p><p>The poet finds it in poetry, the painter in painting, the meditator
in meditation, the lover in love, but it is always bliss. Hence bliss is
syonymous with godliness. To become absolutely blissful is to become
divine.</p><p>Hence I don't teach renunciation; I teach rejoicing. Rejoice more and
more because only when you are throbbing with joy do you ride on that
wave of bliss and start coming closer to god. When the wave of bliss is
a tidal wave it can land you on the farther shore, the ultimate truth,
god, nirvana or whatsoever one may choose to call it. But it is always
the tidal wave of bliss that takes you to the</p><p>farther shore. 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>(Osho has fun with Diotama's name. He even mentions it again in
discourse the following morning!) Dhyano means meditation. Diotama has
two meanings. The first is very beautiful. It means priestess of love,
but the second is just far out! (laughter) The second means a jar with a
neck and two handles. That's what a woman really is! (much laughter)
That is the actual meaning, but through meditation the second meaning is
possible: the jar with a neck and two handles can become a priestess of
love, because meditation is an alchemical process. It transforms the
lowest into the highest.</p><p>But ninety-nine point nine per cent of women remain with the first
meaning; they never reach the second. Becoming a sannyasin means now the
second meaning has to be enquired into, realised. It is potentially
there. And whenever a woman becomes self-realised her realisation is
more full of love than any man's can ever be.</p><p>Whenever a man achieves the ultimate he calls it truth. Whenever a
woman has achieved the ultimate it has always been known as love; that
is the woman's approach. But it is the same experience. Truth seems to
be a little dry, desert- like; love is an oasis. Love is full of song,
joy, dance and celebration.</p><p>Millions of woman have missed for the simple reason that they have
been following Jesus, Buddha, Zarathustra, Lao Tzu -- and they all talk
about truth, obviously. Their very language is male-oriented, and to a
woman the very word 'truth' falls flat; it has no meaning. Just utter
the word 'love' and suddenly a bell starts ringing in the heart of a
woman. Because all the founders of the great religions were men, women
have missed.</p><p>My effort here is to put the balance right. I would like many woman
<em>sannyasins</em></p><p>to become enlightened</p><p>-- this will be happening for the first time -- so that the other
approach also becomes very clear. Women need not go on following
something which does not fit with their deepest longing, which remains a
little distant.</p><p>I don't feel truth can ever be very close to a woman; some distance
will remain. She can try to reach it --</p><p>and many women have tried and a few of them have even reached to the
ultimate peak. But they remain secondary, they are bound to. They cannot
compete with a Buddha. Even if they realise truth, even after their
realisation, their expression will remain very ordinary compared to
Buddha, because what he has found fits with his whole being. And for a
woman truth remains a little bit alien, strange. Only love can release
the woman and her energies.</p><p>So here I am trying to give men their methods and to woman, a totally
different approach. Yes, there are a few men who would like to move
through love and there are a few women who would like to move through
truth. Those are exceptions, they need not be counted; they only prove
the rule.</p><p>So whenever a man becomes realised he becomes s Gautam Buddha, he
becomes a prophet of truth, but whenever a woman achieves she is bound
to become a priestess of love.</p><p>Diotama is a beautiful name, but remember both meanings! The first
has to be changed and the second has to be achieved.</p><p>(Ingrid becomes Prem Sugandho -- love fragrance.)</p><p>Love is more like fragrance than like a flower. A flower has a form
-- but every form gives a limitation and love is unlimited, hence it
can't have any form.</p><p>The flower has colour, the fragrance is colourless. Every colour
makes you one- dimensional, but colourlessness makes you
multi-dimensional. And love, to be truly love, has to be formless,
unlimited, multi-dimensional. If it is linear it becomes lust; if it is
multi-dimensional, it becomes prayer. It is the same energy</p><p>-- love. The lowest it can fall is lust and the highest it can rise
is prayer.</p><p>The energy is not different, it is the same ladder. Lust is the
lowest rung and prayer is the highest rung.</p><p>The name of the ladder is love; it is all the rungs from the lowest
to the highest. That's what I mean when I say it is multi-dimensional,
formless.</p><p>But because of our unawareness we try to give it a form, a colour, a
shape, a limit. We try to create a boundary, and the more we succeed in
doing this, the more love is going to disappear, it will die. It has to
be a bird on the wing, in the sky -- you cannot encage it. Even if you
make a golden cage you will kill the bird.</p><p>The bird in the cage and the bird in the open sky are not the same;
they are two different phenomena.</p><p>They look alike but the bird on the wing, in the winds, in the
clouds, has freedom, and because of freedom it has bliss. The bird in
the cage only looks formally the same but it has no sky, no freedom, no
bliss. And birds don't bother much about whether the cage is made of
gold or iron, whether it is studded with diamonds or just a poor thing
-- it does not matter. These foolish things matter only to man.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>Words like 'diamond' and 'gold' are human inventions; to birds they
don't mean anything. What matters is freedom, and that is destroyed.
Love is a bird and it loves to be free. It needs the whole sky to
grow.</p><p>So remember never to encage it, never to imprison it, never to give
it a limit and a form, a shape, a name, an address, a label -- never.
Just let it remain a fragrance, invisible, and then it can take you on
its wings to the ultimate.</p><p>(An indicator as to his path is Ed's new name, Sagarprem. It means
love for the oceanic, for the unbounded.)</p><p>Anything that has a boundary will imprison you. All boundaries have
to be transcended, surpassed.</p><p>When you have come to a point where no boundary to your being exists,
when you simply are without any definition -- neither Hindu nor
Christian nor Mohammedan, neither German nor American nor Canadian,
neither black nor white, neither man nor woman, neither communist nor
fascists... when you have transcended all these boundaries of the body
and the mind you enter an oceanic world. And that's the search of
sannyas: to go on surpassing till nothing is left to surpass, only then
know that you have come home.</p><p>Before that everything is a caravanserai. You can stay to rest but
don't cling to anything, nothing is your home, just an overnight stay
and remember in the morning you have to go.</p><p>So, there is no need to cling, no need to become attached to
anything. Remain unattached so that your flow is not hindered. Remain
like a river. It passes through many many territories. In the mountains
it comes from the Himalayan peaks, it passes virgin snow. If it clings
it will remain there. And it is beautiful -- those virgin peaks, that
virgin snow has a purity, an innocence, a beauty. But the river moves.
It passes through many beautiful valleys, mountains, forests but it goes
on moving. It passes through many beautiful scenes but without clinging;
it goes on and on till it reaches the ocean.</p><p>Be like a river -- flowing, never getting attached, otherwise you
will become a pond. And a pond can never reach the ocean, only a river
can. So remain open- ended and go on flowing. If one can continue to
flow one has understood the meaning of sannyas. If one can remain a
river in life one has experienced the innermost core of sannyas. Then
the ocean is not far away. Howsoever far away it is, it is not far
away.</p><p>(To a psychology teacher Osho gives the name Prem Sugatha.) Prem
means love. Sugatha means a beautiful story. Life can either be a tragi
dy or it can be a beautiful love story. Either it can be just a series
of miseries, nightmares or it can be just a continuum of
celebration.</p><p>It all depends on us , what we make out of it. It is an empty canvas.
We have to paint it. We can make a monster on the canvas and can become
frightened by it or we can create a beautiful sunset or flowers and we
can be enchanted by it.</p><p>Remember: man comes into the world as an empty canvas. God does not
give any programme to you, you are not programmed. There is nothing like
fate; it is</p><p>the invention of the cowards, it is the invention of people who don't
want to make anything out of their life -- who are so lazy, so cowardly,
that they don't want to take any risk. They throw the whole
responsibility on god. They call it fate, kismet, karma and thousands of
names, but all are basically tricks to avoid the responsibility that 'My
life is my responsibility.</p><p>Whatsoever I am I have made it that way and whatsoever I am going to
be tomorrow I am creating today.</p><p>Nothing can be done about yesterday; there is no need to bother about
it, it is finished. But today is still available and out of today all
the tomorrows will be coming. And if one is alert just a small touch can
change the whole story.</p><p>Two small boys were talking; one boy was the son of a great painter.
He said 'My father is such a great artist. Just the other day I was
watching him painting. He painted a picture and the man was looking so
miserable that I said to him "Father, why are you making him so
miserable?" He said "Okay, I will change it." And with just one stroke
of his brush the man started smiling!' And the other boy said 'That's
nothing, my mother does it every day: without even having a paintbrush,
just one stroke and she can make me cry or weep. That's nothing much.
Not even a stroke, just the way she looks is enough.'</p><p>We are absolutely responsible for whatsoever we are. By becoming a
sannyasin this is the first thing to accept, that 'Whatsoever I am is my
responsibility.' But in it there is freedom. In the beginning it hurts
because the ego feels badly shattered: 'Is it my own responsibility? So
I have made this whole mess, this whole chaos that I am?' It hurts the
ego, but if we understand it then it can become the beginning of a new
life. And just a few strokes and the sad face can become a smiling face.
Just a few strokes, just little bits of changes here and there and the
ugly painting can become a beautiful painting.</p><p>Sannyas is the art of painting rightly, meditatively, so that life
can be a continuously growing love, bliss, 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on

But it can become so because death is not the end of life but the
highest peak of life, the very summum bonum of life. In a single moment
of death the person tells his whole story, whether he has lived
authentically or inauthentically, whether he has lived lovingly or
violently, whether he has lived out of silence or has been just insane.
The moment of death expresses his whole life condensed. And we have to
prepare for that moment.</p><p>But whatsoever we have to do has to be done today, because yesterday
is no more and tomorrow has not come yet.</p><p>All that is available to us is today, but today is enough.</p><p>(Change your orientation from accumulation to transformation, Osho
tells Anandgyan.) Change only one thing, change from misery to bliss.
from sadness to celebration. And it can be done very easily because
misery is an unnatural thing.</p><p>We are making such a hard effort to remain miserable. People don't
see it. When they do they will laugh at the whole ridiculousness of what
they have been doing to themselves. They are really doing great work to
create misery in every possible way. They don't miss a single
opportunity; they jump upon anything that can make thorn miserable.</p><p>This approach has to be changed. And life gives both opportunities to
you. It gives you the day, it gives you the night, it gives you the
thorns and the roses, it gives you both opportunities. And it is always
balanced, it is always fifty-fifty; it depends on you what you choose.
And the miracle is that if you choose the thorns sooner or later you
will find there are no flowers because your mind will become accustomed
only to thorns. You will only be able to see thorns, you will miss the
flowers; you will simply not take any note of them. And the person who
chooses flowers, the same happens to him: he starts forgetting about
thorns, he takes no note of them. His approach becomes so positive and
so affirmative that his whole arithmetic is different.</p><p>There are people who have invented the saying that every dark cloud
has a silver lining, and there are people who say that every silver
lining has a dark cloud to it. Both are right. I am not saying that any
one person is right and the other is wrong; both are right. But the
problem arises of what it is going to give to you.</p><p>There are people who think there is only one day between two nights
and there are people who think there is only one night between two days.
Both are right; so far as being right is concerned there is no problem,
but what is it going to do to you? If you think in a negative way then
your life will be a misery and how can a miserable person be religious?
What has he to thank god for? Only a blissful person can be religious
because he has so much to thank god for. Every day flowers go on
showering on him.</p><p>I have heard about a very beautiful rabbi who fell from a
one-hundred-storey building. The rabbi was well-known; all over the
building everybody knew him. And people looked from their windows and
they asked 'How are you' And he said 'So far, so good!' He went on
falling, saying 'So far, so good!'</p><p>That is the right thing so far, so good. And who cares what is going
to happen next? -- if it is going to happen it is going to happen. But
the man who can say 'So far, so good,' till the very end, his end will
also be totally different because it will be the accumulation of his
whole approach. It cannot come from nowhere, it comes from his being:
his death will also be beautiful.</p><p>(Osho names Erik, Swami Raidas after an Indian mystic. Although he
was of the same calibre as Buddha, Nanak and Kabir, he is not so well
known, Osho explains, because he was poor; in fact he was an illiterate
cobbler.)</p><p>In India to be a cobbler means to be an untouchable.</p><p>That is one of the greatest misfortunes that has happened to India;
almost one- third of the population is rejected, as if they are not
human beings. They are living not as part of society but as outsiders,
on the fringes. They are not even allowed to live in the villages; they
have to live outside the villages.</p><p>For centuries these poor untouchables were not allowed to drink from
the same well as the whole village drank from. They were not allowed to
move on certain streets, they were not allowed to come into the villages
in the daylight, or if they had to they had to declare that they were
coming -- 'Please move yourself away' -</p><p>- because even their shadow was thought to be evil. If their shadow
fell on you you had to take a bath to purify yourself. This is the
ugliest thing that India has done.</p><p>Raidas belonged to those poor people, hence he never became famous --
there was no possibility. But he was of the same status as Buddha,
Krishna, Mahavira.</p><p>His statements are very simple, that of an illiterate 1/08/07

philosophising, no going round and round in circles.</p><p>His statements are few but they go direct, like an arrow, and simply
hit your heart. He used to sing and dance his songs. Whosoever was
courageous enough to come to him would come.</p><p>This man, Raidas, had only one message and that was: if you can dance
and sing totally, forgetting yourself, lost in the dance and the song,
you have entered into god. And that's my message too. Dropping the ego
by any strategy is enough. The moment you drop the ego, the moment you
forget yourself... Not that you become unconscious or you fall into a
coma, it is simply that self-consciousness is no more there.</p><p>Consciousness is there more than ever but there is no self, no ego.
In that very moment the meeting with god happens.</p><p>So his whole message was to dance so totally, to sing so totally,
that the ego could be forgotten and you would enter into god. There is
no need to go to the temple, he said, there is no need to worship any
idol, there is no need to perform any ritual; do only one thing:
whatsoever you are doing do it so totally that you are immersed in it.

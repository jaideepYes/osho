It is for reference purposes only.]\n(His new name contains the meaning of sannyas -- meditation and victorious peace, Osho tells Dhyan Siggi.)\nSannyas means entering into the inner world your being -- and that entry brings both meditation and peace. And wherever these two meet there is victory.\nMeditation without peace is dead, forced, not really meditation but only some kind of concentration.\nAnd that is one of the greatest errors committed by many people: they think concentration is meditation. It is not. Meditation is just the opposite of it.\nConcentration is a tense state of mind, meditation is a relaxed state of mind. And the miracle of relaxation is that when relaxation is total the mind disappears. Mind can only exist with tensions, anxieties worries. It feeds on them; hence concentration never leads you beyond the mind. It can manage to give you a certain strength of mind, it can make your mind function more efficiently, more powerfully, because you will be less distracted, but it won't help you to attain a state of no-mind.\nMeditation is a state of no-mind. And only in meditation, in true meditation, does peace happen. It is just a natural fragrance of meditation.\nOne can also be peaceful without meditation -- then again something goes wrong. That peace remains only on the surface and deep inside there is always turmoil, one is sitting on a volcano -- sitting peace-fully, but the volcano is there and it can erupt any moment. Any excuse will do.\nNever force yourself to be peaceful and never force the mind in any way, on any subject, in any direction. Enter relaxation, total relaxation, doing nothing -- just being -- and in that moment, when you are a pure being, doing nothing -- no effort to be peaceful, no effort to concentrate -- when there is no effort at all on your part, in that effortless moment meditation and peace happen simultaneously. And that brings victory, inner victory. It makes you the master of your own soul, of your own destiny.\n(Osho adds Deva, to Lothar to make his full name mean divine vastness and glory. To be vast is glorious, Osho observes.)\nTo live within limitations is to live in gloom, in a state of indignity. It is a humiliation because our being needs the whole sky, only then can it dance, sing, be. Otherwise everything is crippled, paralysed; there is no space to fly, no space to move. And man lives in limitations: the limitation of the body, the limitation of the mind, the limitations of emotions, moods. Those are all limitations upon limitations. And all these limitations have to be transcended.\nThat's the function of meditation, to help you to go beyond all boundaries. It is a voyage into the 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nunbounded. Then all glory is yours; then life is a benediction, a sheer festivity, a pure joy. And to me joy is the only thing that is godly, because it brings all other godly qualities -- love, truth, consciousness, silence.\nIt brings everything that is needed, that is a requirement for spiritual growth.\nWithout joy nobody can grow.\nIn misery one shrinks, in joy one expands.\nAnd that is the meaning of your name, Lothar: expansiveness. And man should never become contented with any boundary. Whenever you come to a boundary try to go beyond it. When all boundaries are transcended, when you have reached infinity, you have come to god, you have come home.\n(The new sannyasin's name is Swami Antar Ueli. Antar comes from the same root as the English word\n'inner' Osho tells us.)\nThere are two worlds. One is on the outside, the other is on the inside. They are two only for the ignorant, they are two only because you have not yet seen the unity, because the ego is standing between the two like a dividing line. Once the ego evaporates, disappears, there is only one world. Then it is neither subjective nor objective, neither outer nor inner, but to begin with we have to accept the state in which we are; hence I say there are two worlds. I mean for you there are two worlds -- the outside world and the inside world.\nTo enter into ultimate truth first one has to explore the inner. And we all explore the outer -- we begin with the wrong step. Then everything else goes wrong. If the first step is wrong then everything else is going to be wrong.\nFirst one has to explore oneself: 'Who am I?' Once you are settled with that, once you have seen your reality then the whole world can be explored, but then you will be standing on solid ground. Otherwise the stupidity is that you don't know who you are and you go on knowing everything else. Your own house remains in darkness and you go on and on looking at all kinds of lights available on the outside. That is not going to help.\nNo outer light can be brought in. You have to find your inner source of light first. That's why Socrates says 'Know thyself.' That is the very essence of all the religions, the very soul. That's what I mean by Antar: your interiority. Explore it\n-- and it is one of the most ecstatic adventures. In fact, the greatest ecstatic adventure. No other adventure can be compared with it, everything falls short. Even going to the moon or to Mars falls short. It is nothing compared to the journey that Jesus made or Buddha made. They are real adventurers.\nAnd your name, Ueli, means a noble ruler. If you rule somebody else you cannot be noble. Take it as a categorical truth: if you rule others you cannot be noble. The very idea of ruling others is ignoble, it is ugly, because by ruling others you reduce them to things. A slave is destroyed completely -- not only his body, not only his mind, but his soul is destroyed. In all the countries slavery has existed in the past and slaves were treated like things. One could kill one's slave, it was not a crime -- because if you dismantle your chair, what is the crime in it? Nobody can take you to court. If you destroy your car that's up to you; it is your car.\nThe same was true about slaves: one could destroy them, one could murder them. There was no appeal for them, no court, no justice existed for them. They were not thought to be human beings.\nThe same has been true in the past about women: they were also treated as slaves, as property. In China it was not a crime to kill your wife. You could sell your wife in the marketplace, there was no problem about it -- she belonged to you.\nWhenever one rules others one is being very immoral, very irreligious, one is being a criminal, a sinner.\nOne can be a noble ruler only in the inner world. That means you rule your own mind, body, soul, you have mastery of all that you are, you are not a victim of unconscious instincts any more. Hence the real mastery is of the inner, not of the outer.\nAlexander conquered the then-known world, but all his victory was simply violence, murder, arson, destruction. He was a calamity to humanity. All the great conquerors, the so-called great conquerors of course, have been calamities, curses. But a Zarathustra, a Lao Tzu, a Krishna -- they are pure blessings to humanity. But their rule was of a totally different world: they ruled themselves. They were in absolute inner discipline. There was no conflict within them, they had come to understand their whole conscious and unconscious, their totality. And in that very knowing one becomes a master.\nSo be a noble ruler, but the only way to be a noble ruler is to go in. Possess yourself, be absolutely rooted, centred, integrated, so that you can move according to your light, so no unconscious instinct forces you to move in a certain direction, so you need not go into something into which you never\nwanted to go.\nBut this is really the situation. That's why in all the languages phrases like 'in spite of myself' exist. It simply 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nmeans you are not the master. You become angry and then later on you apologize and you say 'I never wanted to be, but I became angry in spite of myself.' What does it mean? What are you confessing?\nYou are confessing that there are forces inside you over which you don't have any mastery. They can do things which you don't want to do. But what kind of a life is this, where you don't have any idea of your own forces. Anger can come and one can commit murder in an enraged state, and then guilt comes, naturally, because you have done something which you never wanted to do in the first place.\nModern psychology has come to a decisive conclusion that only one part of our mind is conscious, nine parts are unconscious. So just a very small fragment, just a very small part of your being, is conscious, but the major part, nine out of ten fragments are unconscious. It is just like an iceberg: only one-tenth is above the surface of the ocean, nine-tenths is below the surface. How can one-tenth decide for nine-tenths? --\nimpossible. But meditation helps you to make your conscious slowly bigger and to slowly reduce the unconscious to a point where it totally disappears. Then your whole being becomes conscious, full of light.\nThat is the meaning of the word 'enlightenment': when nothing is dark inside of you, then the master has arisen in you. You are no more a victim of unconscious forces, you are totally in control. And without any enforcement, just by being aware, conscious, has this mastery happened.\nThis mastery has a beauty, a grace. Of course such a man will help many people to be masters of themselves. That's my purpose here. A sannyasin is not a\nfollower, he is a fellow traveller. A sannyasin is not to imitate me, he has just to understand me, that's all. Nothing else is expected. In that very understanding he will slowly come out of the darkness. And as one comes out of darkness life starts having a meaning, tremendous meaning, significance, splendour.\n(The words evolution and revolution are immensely important, Osho tells newly named Veet Vikas --\ngoing beyond evolution.)\nEvolution is an unconscious phenomenon. It is a natural phenomenon. The scientists say man was born as a fish in the ocean. Millions of years have passed between the stage of the fish and that of the human being. It took really long to get to the stage of a human being. Man had to pass through almost all kinds of animal stages. The last stage before man was something like the ape, the monkey.\nAll this has happened unconsciously; no deliberate effort has been there. But since man became man that evolutionary process seems to have stopped. It seems it has come to its culmination, because man has been man for thousands of years and nothing has happened, no further growth has happened. It definitively shows one thing: that nature has done all it could do; now we have to take the whole course in our hands.\nWe have to move from evolution to revolution.\nEvolution means unconscious, revolution means conscious. Evolution is growth but because it is unconscious it takes millions of years. Revolution is also growth but because it is conscious it is like a quantum leap, like a jump. It is not gradual, you don't go slowly step by step. It all depends on you, on how courageous you are. Even in a single step one can move from a human being to a god, to a Buddha, to a Christ, just in a single leap. It all depends on your intensity, your commitment, involvement, your totality.\nSannyas is significant only because the process of evolution has stopped, it has come to a full stop. Now man will not be growing naturally. There is no possibility of man growing naturally any more, he will remain man unless he decides to grow consciously, deliberately, purposively. That's what sannyas is, a conscious decision to grow. And that is the beginning of revolution.\nGo beyond evolution and start a revolution in your life.\n(Hans, a woodcutter from Holland, receives the name Dhyan Veetesh. It means, meditation is transcendence -- of the body, of the mind and even of the heart, in the final analysis.) Think of man as consisting of four things, The first concentric circle is of the body -- that is the outermost part of man. The second concentric circle within the first is of mind. The third is of the heart --\nemotions, feelings. And the fourth is your very centre -- that is your being.\nMillions of people live only on the first circle. They think of themselves as their physiology, so eating, drinking and being merry is all that they think life consists of. They think that life begins with birth and ends with death and there is nothing more to it -- the materialist's standpoint.\nNothing is wrong in eating, drinking and merrying, but to stop there is stupid. There is much more to life. And one need not renounce the body; one has to use the body as a stepping stone to reach higher planes, as a jumping board to reach depths. The body is beautiful, I am not against the body, I am not anti-body; I am not anti-anything. I want everything to be used because whatsoever god has given to you 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nhas a purpose; you may know it. you may not know it. That's why I don't teach any renunciation. But man has to know that he has to go farther than the body, otherwise he will remain unfulfilled.\nHe has been given a palace and he just lives in the porch. The porch is beautiful, the porch is needed, the porch is part of the palace. But you need not make it an abode when the whole palace is yours. This is sheer foolishness, not to live in the palace and to just go on living in the porch.\nThe body is just the porch, a connection between you and the world, that's all, but it is not your total reality, just the most superficial layer. Go a little deeper and there is mind. And the joys of mind are higher than the joys of the body. The\nbody needs only two joys: sex and food. That is the lowest kind of joy, the animal kind.\nMind knows better joys -- of music, of painting of poetry, of literature. Then the whole world expands.\nSuddenly you start enjoying the subtle things of life. What can food give you compared to the great music of Mozart? What can sex give you compared to great literature, poetry, painting? Once you have started enjoying the world of the mind, the body becomes just a small part in it. You can still enjoy food, in fact you will enjoy it better than before because some aesthetics will enter your eating. You can still enjoy your sex but now your sex will have a depth which was missing before. Something of music will be in it, something of poetry will be in it, something of the paintings that you have enjoyed is bound to be there, because whatsoever you enjoy enters your very fibres, your very cells.\nA man who knows only sex and food knows nothing. His sex is very rough, mundane; it has no sacred dimension to it. And his eating is animal. He cannot enjoy eating with others, he cannot share.\nHave you watched animals? -- when animals get food they hide themselves so no other animal can partake of their food. And if there are other animals they keep them behind them and they somehow go on stuffing themselves fast, because the fear is always there that some other animal may attack them, it is dangerous.\nThe same is true about the man who knows nothing higher than the body.\nMind gives you a new depth but mind is also not the end; there is a still higher and a deeper phenomenon. And always remember: whatsoever is higher is always deeper and vice versa; whatsoever is deeper is always higher. Then the world of the heart, of love, of emotions, sentiments, opens up. Now you are reaching the subtlest core.\nA man who has not known what love is has missed the whole point of life. His heart has remained unopened. And when the heart opens, only then does spring come to you, then you blossom. But even the heart is not the end.\nBuddha used to say to his disciples 'Charaiveti, charaiveti.' Charaiveti means go on, go on, don't stop anywhere. Till you come to the very end where the road\nends and where there is no further to go, go on, go on: charaiveti, charaiveti. And at each stop you will feel that this must be the end. What more can there be?\nWhen you are in love, when love is flowering, you cannot conceive of anything greater. But there is something still greater which will make you aware of your centre and that is meditation. And at the centre we are joined at the universe. Your centre and my centre are not separate, your centre and Christ's centre are not separate. At the centre we all meet; we are different only on the periphery.\nWhen you have come to know the centre you have come to know god. There the road ends. Beyond that there is nothing. But before that one has not to stop anywhere. That is the meaning of your name: go on, go on, go on transcending. While anything remains to transcend, go on. When you come to the end and there is nothing left to transcend, only then rest at peace. That is paradise.\n(He doesn't believe in believing, Osho tells Dhyan Darshana, he believes in seeing. He pauses till the laughter subsides and then resumes.)\nUnless you see, never believe, because the danger is that one can believe in something very easily if the belief is comfortable, consoling; if it fulfils a certain need in you, you can believe. But belief stops enquiry.\nThe moment you believe, there is nothing to explore.\nSo don't believe in god and don't believe that there is no god either; both are beliefs. One is positive, one is negative, but both are beliefs. Neither be religious nor be irreligious, neither be an atheist nor a theist.\nRemain open. That's what I mean when I say don't believe: remain open.\nRemain aware: that 'I don't know.' It is difficult to remember 'I don't know' because it hurts the ego. The ego wants to claim knowledge, the ego wants to make claims about everything. That's why if even to the ugliest person you say 'You are beautiful,' he will believe you; even the ugliest person will not deny it.\nYou can say to the most stupid person, 'You are simply a great Buddha, a great wise man, and he will 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nnot deny it. He will smile at you patronisingly. In fact he will say to you 'You are the only intelligent person because you have recognised me. Fools don't recognise me.' That's why it is easy to buttress people --\nbecause nobody denies anything. The ego is always hankering to be supported. And knowledge is one of the greatest supports of the ego, so one goes on believing in things because it creates knowledgeability.\nThere are Christians, Hindus and Mohammedans and Buddhists and almost everybody belongs to some religion, to some political ideology -- communist, socialist, fascist. These are people who know nothing, but they believe because belief gives them the idea that they know -- and everybody wants to be in the know.\nBelief is the cheapest way, at no cost. And the person who believes in end... look at him when he comes across a person who does not believe in god, see how superior he feels, that 'I believe in god and you don't believe in god.' He really feels great sympathy for you, pity for you that you will fall in hell, that you will not be saved. Deep down he says 'poor fellow.' He himself is in the same state, but the belief hides his ignorance. And hiding is not getting rid of; it is in a way really protecting.\nMy sannyasins have to be open -- no belief, no belief system,,neither against nor for. Religious, political\n-- all kinds of ideologies have to be put aside so that you can move with a clarity, an innocence, a childlike innocence. And that is meditation: to remain open, silent, aware, watchful, so that you can see whatsoever is the case. You don't project anything on it. Because you don't have any belief you cannot project, you can see that which is. And that is the meaning of darshana.\nIn the East we don't have any word with exactly the same meaning as philosophy. In the East philosophy is called darshana, but it has a totally different meaning.\nPhilosophy means thinking about truth and darshana means seeing the truth, not\nthinking. What can you think about the truth? What can the blind man think about light? What can the deaf think about music? It is impossible to thing anything. What is needed is not thinking but a restoration of your eyes so that you can see, an opening of your eyes so that you can see. Only seeing liberates.\nAnd it is not so difficult as people think it is. It is not so difficult. Once you decide that you will not believe unless you know, it becomes very easy. Once all the rubbish, the rotten accumulation of beliefs, is removed you have a clarity, a transparency, and you start seeing things as they are. And that's what god is.\nThe word 'god' is a code word; it does not mean anything literally, it is a code word. G stands for that, O\nstands for which, and D stands for is -- that which is. That is the meaning of the word 'god'. It has no literal meaning at all, it is simply a code word: that which is. And the only way to know it is to have clean eyes.\nMeditation helps you to remove all garbage and makes you capable of seeing. And the moment you see, you are liberated, because the moment you see, it is your own truth, it is not borrowed, and only your own truth can become liberation. It is bliss and it is love and it is prayer, because when one is free there is bliss and when there is bliss one wants to share it. It is a natural phenomenon, to share it. And that's what love is: sharing of your bliss.\nFreedom brings bliss, bliss brings love, then life becomes a fulfilment, a deep contentment.\nI Am Not As Thunk As You Drink I Am Chapter #5\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"4000","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/i_am_not_as_thunk_as_you_drink_i_am/part3/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/i_am_not_as_thunk_as_you_drink_i_am/>I Am Not As Thunk As You Drink I Am</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>19 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;4000 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/I_Am_Not_As_Thunk_As_You_Drink_I_Am/part3.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part2>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

victorious peace, Osho tells Dhyan Siggi.)</p><p>Sannyas means entering into the inner world your being -- and that
entry brings both meditation and peace. And wherever these two meet
there is victory.</p><p>Meditation without peace is dead, forced, not really meditation but
only some kind of concentration.</p><p>And that is one of the greatest errors committed by many people: they
think concentration is meditation. It is not. Meditation is just the
opposite of it.</p><p>Concentration is a tense state of mind, meditation is a relaxed state
of mind. And the miracle of relaxation is that when relaxation is total
the mind disappears. Mind can only exist with tensions, anxieties
worries. It feeds on them; hence concentration never leads you beyond
the mind. It can manage to give you a certain strength of mind, it can
make your mind function more efficiently, more powerfully, because you
will be less distracted, but it won't help you to attain a state of
no-mind.</p><p>Meditation is a state of no-mind. And only in meditation, in true
meditation, does peace happen. It is just a natural fragrance of
meditation.</p><p>One can also be peaceful without meditation -- then again something
goes wrong. That peace remains only on the surface and deep inside there
is always turmoil, one is sitting on a volcano -- sitting peace-fully,
but the volcano is there and it can erupt any moment. Any excuse will
do.</p><p>Never force yourself to be peaceful and never force the mind in any
way, on any subject, in any direction. Enter relaxation, total
relaxation, doing nothing -- just being -- and in that moment, when you
are a pure being, doing nothing -- no effort to be peaceful, no effort
to concentrate -- when there is no effort at all on your part, in that
effortless moment meditation and peace happen simultaneously. And that
brings victory, inner victory. It makes you the master of your own soul,
of your own destiny.</p><p>(Osho adds Deva, to Lothar to make his full name mean divine vastness
and glory. To be vast <em>is</em> glorious, Osho observes.)</p><p>To live within limitations is to live in gloom, in a state of
indignity. It is a humiliation because our being needs the whole sky,
only then can it dance, sing, be. Otherwise everything is crippled,
paralysed; there is no space to fly, no space to move. And man lives in
limitations: the limitation of the body, the limitation of the mind, the
limitations of emotions, moods. Those are all limitations upon
limitations. And all these limitations have to be transcended.</p><p>That's the function of meditation, to help you to go beyond all
boundaries. It is a voyage into the 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished>Osho's books on

sheer festivity, a pure joy. And to me joy is the only thing that is
godly, because it brings all other godly qualities -- love, truth,
consciousness, silence.</p><p>It brings everything that is needed, that is a requirement for
spiritual growth.</p><p>Without joy nobody can grow.</p><p>In misery one shrinks, in joy one expands.</p><p>And that is the meaning of your name, Lothar: expansiveness. And man
should never become contented with any boundary. Whenever you come to a
boundary try to go beyond it. When all boundaries are transcended, when
you have reached infinity, you have come to god, you have come home.</p><p>(The new sannyasin's name is Swami Antar Ueli. Antar comes from the
same root as the English word</p><p>'inner' Osho tells us.)</p><p>There are two worlds. One is on the outside, the other is on the
inside. They are two only for the ignorant, they are two only because
you have not yet seen the unity, because the ego is standing between the
two like a dividing line. Once the ego evaporates, disappears, there is
only one world. Then it is neither subjective nor objective, neither
outer nor inner, but to begin with we have to accept the state in which
we are; hence I say there are two worlds. I mean for <em>you</em> there
are two worlds -- the outside world and the inside world.</p><p>To enter into ultimate truth first one has to explore the inner. And
we all explore the outer -- we begin with the wrong step. Then
everything else goes wrong. If the first step is wrong then everything
else is going to be wrong.</p><p>First one has to explore oneself: 'Who am I?' Once you are settled
with that, once you have seen your reality then the whole world can be
explored, but then you will be standing on solid ground. Otherwise the
stupidity is that you don't know who you are and you go on knowing
everything else. Your own house remains in darkness and you go on and on
looking at all kinds of lights available on the outside. That is not
going to help.</p><p>No outer light can be brought in. You have to find your inner source
of light first. That's why Socrates says 'Know thyself.' That is the
very essence of all the religions, the very soul. That's what I mean by
Antar: your interiority. Explore it</p><p>-- and it is one of the most ecstatic adventures. In fact, the
greatest ecstatic adventure. No other adventure can be compared with it,
everything falls short. Even going to the moon or to Mars falls short.
It is nothing compared to the journey that Jesus made or Buddha made.
They are real adventurers.</p><p>And your name, Ueli, means a noble ruler. If you rule somebody else
you cannot be noble. Take it as a categorical truth: if you rule others
you cannot be noble. The very idea of ruling others is ignoble, it is
ugly, because by ruling others you reduce them to things. A slave is
destroyed completely -- not only his body, not only his mind, but his
soul is destroyed. In all the countries slavery has existed in the past
and slaves were treated like things. One could kill one's slave, it was
not a crime -- because if you dismantle your chair, what is the crime in
it? Nobody can take you to court. If you destroy your car that's up to
you; it is your car.</p><p>The same was true about slaves: one could destroy them, one could
murder them. There was no appeal for them, no court, no justice existed
for them. They were not thought to be human beings.</p><p>The same has been true in the past about women: they were also
treated as slaves, as property. In China it was not a crime to kill your
wife. You could sell your wife in the marketplace, there was no problem
about it -- she belonged to you.</p><p>Whenever one rules others one is being very immoral, very
irreligious, one is being a criminal, a sinner.</p><p>One can be a noble ruler only in the inner world. That means you rule
your own mind, body, soul, you have mastery of all that you are, you are
not a victim of unconscious instincts any more. Hence the real mastery
is of the inner, not of the outer.</p><p>Alexander conquered the then-known world, but all his victory was
simply violence, murder, arson, destruction. He was a calamity to
humanity. All the great conquerors, the so-called great conquerors of
course, have been calamities, curses. But a Zarathustra, a Lao Tzu, a
Krishna -- they are pure blessings to humanity. But their rule was of a
totally different world: they ruled themselves. They were in absolute
inner discipline. There was no conflict within them, they had come to
understand their whole conscious and unconscious, their totality. And in
that very knowing one becomes a master.</p><p>So be a noble ruler, but the only way to be a noble ruler is to go
in. Possess yourself, be absolutely rooted, centred, integrated, so that
you can move according to your light, so no unconscious instinct forces
you to move in a certain direction, so you need not go into something
into which you never</p><p>wanted to go.</p><p>But this is really the situation. That's why in all the languages
phrases like 'in spite of myself' exist. It simply 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>means you are not the master. You become angry and then later on you
apologize and you say 'I never wanted to be, but I became angry in spite
of myself.' What does it mean? What are you confessing?</p><p>You are confessing that there are forces inside you over which you
don't have any mastery. They can do things which you don't want to do.
But what kind of a life is this, where you don't have any idea of your
own forces. Anger can come and one can commit murder in an enraged
state, and then guilt comes, naturally, because you have done something
which you never wanted to do in the first place.</p><p>Modern psychology has come to a decisive conclusion that only one
part of our mind is conscious, nine parts are unconscious. So just a
very small fragment, just a very small part of your being, is conscious,
but the major part, nine out of ten fragments are unconscious. It is
just like an iceberg: only one-tenth is above the surface of the ocean,
nine-tenths is below the surface. How can one-tenth decide for
nine-tenths? --</p><p>impossible. But meditation helps you to make your conscious slowly
bigger and to slowly reduce the unconscious to a point where it totally
disappears. Then your whole being becomes conscious, full of light.</p><p>That is the meaning of the word 'enlightenment': when nothing is dark
inside of you, then the master has arisen in you. You are no more a
victim of unconscious forces, you are totally in control. And without
any enforcement, just by being aware, conscious, has this mastery
happened.</p><p>This mastery has a beauty, a grace. Of course such a man will help
many people to be masters of themselves. That's my purpose here. A
sannyasin is not a</p><p>follower, he is a fellow traveller. A sannyasin is not to imitate me,
he has just to understand me, that's all. Nothing else is expected. In
that very understanding he will slowly come out of the darkness. And as
one comes out of darkness life starts having a meaning, tremendous
meaning, significance, splendour.</p><p>(The words evolution and revolution are immensely important, Osho
tells newly named Veet Vikas --</p><p>going beyond evolution.)</p><p>Evolution is an unconscious phenomenon. It is a natural phenomenon.
The scientists say man was born as a fish in the ocean. Millions of
years have passed between the stage of the fish and that of the human
being. It took really long to get to the stage of a human being. Man had
to pass through almost all kinds of animal stages. The last stage before
man was something like the ape, the monkey.</p><p>All this has happened unconsciously; no deliberate effort has been
there. But since man became man that evolutionary process seems to have
stopped. It seems it has come to its culmination, because man has been
man for thousands of years and nothing has happened, no further growth
has happened. It definitively shows one thing: that nature has done all
it could do; now we have to take the whole course in our hands.</p><p>We have to move from evolution to revolution.</p><p>Evolution means unconscious, revolution means conscious. Evolution is
growth but because it is unconscious it takes millions of years.
Revolution is also growth but because it is conscious it is like a
quantum leap, like a jump. It is not gradual, you don't go slowly step
by step. It all depends on you, on how courageous you are. Even in a
single step one can move from a human being to a god, to a Buddha, to a
Christ, just in a single leap. It all depends on your intensity, your
commitment, involvement, your totality.</p><p>Sannyas is significant only because the process of evolution has
stopped, it has come to a full stop. Now man will not be growing
naturally. There is no possibility of man growing naturally any more, he
will remain man unless he decides to grow consciously, deliberately,
purposively. That's what sannyas is, a conscious decision to grow. And
that is the beginning of revolution.</p><p>Go beyond evolution and start a revolution in your life.</p><p>(Hans, a woodcutter from Holland, receives the name Dhyan Veetesh. It
means, meditation is transcendence -- of the body, of the mind and even
of the heart, in the final analysis.) Think of man as consisting of four
things, The first concentric circle is of the body -- that is the
outermost part of man. The second concentric circle within the first is
of mind. The third is of the heart --</p><p>emotions, feelings. And the fourth is your very centre -- that is
your being.</p><p>Millions of people live only on the first circle. They think of
themselves as their physiology, so eating, drinking and being merry is
all that they think life consists of. They think that life begins with
birth and ends with death and there is nothing more to it -- the
materialist's standpoint.</p><p>Nothing is wrong in eating, drinking and merrying, but to stop there
is stupid. There is much more to life. And one need not renounce the
body; one has to use the body as a stepping stone to reach higher
planes, as a jumping board to reach depths. The body is beautiful, I am
not against the body, I am not anti-body; I am not anti-anything. I want
everything to be used because whatsoever god has given to you

don't teach any renunciation. But man has to know that he has to go
farther than the body, otherwise he will remain unfulfilled.</p><p>He has been given a palace and he just lives in the porch. The porch
is beautiful, the porch is needed, the porch is part of the palace. But
you need not make it an abode when the whole palace is yours. This is
sheer foolishness, not to live in the palace and to just go on living in
the porch.</p><p>The body is just the porch, a connection between you and the world,
that's all, but it is not your total reality, just the most superficial
layer. Go a little deeper and there is mind. And the joys of mind are
higher than the joys of the body. The</p><p>body needs only two joys: sex and food. That is the lowest kind of
joy, the animal kind.</p><p>Mind knows better joys -- of music, of painting of poetry, of
literature. Then the whole world expands.</p><p>Suddenly you start enjoying the subtle things of life. What can food
give you compared to the great music of Mozart? What can sex give you
compared to great literature, poetry, painting? Once you have started
enjoying the world of the mind, the body becomes just a small part in
it. You can still enjoy food, in fact you will enjoy it better than
before because some aesthetics will enter your eating. You can still
enjoy your sex but now your sex will have a depth which was missing
before. Something of music will be in it, something of poetry will be in
it, something of the paintings that you have enjoyed is bound to be
there, because whatsoever you enjoy enters your very fibres, your very
cells.</p><p>A man who knows only sex and food knows nothing. His sex is very
rough, mundane; it has no sacred dimension to it. And his eating is
animal. He cannot enjoy eating with others, he cannot share.</p><p>Have you watched animals? -- when animals get food they hide
themselves so no other animal can partake of their food. And if there
are other animals they keep them behind them and they somehow go on
stuffing themselves fast, because the fear is always there that some
other animal may attack them, it is dangerous.</p><p>The same is true about the man who knows nothing higher than the
body.</p><p>Mind gives you a new depth but mind is also not the end; there is a
still higher and a deeper phenomenon. And always remember: whatsoever is
higher is always deeper and vice versa; whatsoever is deeper is always
higher. Then the world of the heart, of love, of emotions, sentiments,
opens up. Now you are reaching the subtlest core.</p><p>A man who has not known what love is has missed the whole point of
life. His heart has remained unopened. And when the heart opens, only
then does spring come to you, then you blossom. But even the heart is
not the end.</p><p>Buddha used to say to his disciples 'Charaiveti, charaiveti.'
Charaiveti means go on, go on, don't stop anywhere. Till you come to the
very end where the road</p><p>ends and where there is no further to go, go on, go on: charaiveti,
charaiveti. And at each stop you will feel that this must be the end.
What more can there be?</p><p>When you are in love, when love is flowering, you cannot conceive of
anything greater. But there is something still greater which will make
you aware of your centre and that is meditation. And at the centre we
are joined at the universe. Your centre and my centre are not separate,
your centre and Christ's centre are not separate. At the centre we all
meet; we are different only on the periphery.</p><p>When you have come to know the centre you have come to know god.
There the road ends. Beyond that there is nothing. But before that one
has not to stop anywhere. That is the meaning of your name: go on, go
on, go on transcending. While anything remains to transcend, go on. When
you come to the end and there is nothing left to transcend, only then
rest at peace. That is paradise.</p><p>(He doesn't believe in believing, Osho tells Dhyan Darshana, he
believes in seeing. He pauses till the laughter subsides and then
resumes.)</p><p>Unless you see, never believe, because the danger is that one can
believe in something very easily if the belief is comfortable,
consoling; if it fulfils a certain need in you, you can believe. But
belief stops enquiry.</p><p>The moment you believe, there is nothing to explore.</p><p>So don't believe in god <em>and</em> don't believe that there is no
god either; both are beliefs. One is positive, one is negative, but both
are beliefs. Neither be religious nor be irreligious, neither be an
atheist nor a theist.</p><p>Remain open. That's what I mean when I say don't believe: remain
open.</p><p>Remain aware: that 'I don't know.' It is difficult to remember 'I
don't know' because it hurts the ego. The ego wants to claim knowledge,
the ego wants to make claims about everything. That's why if even to the
ugliest person you say 'You are beautiful,' he will believe you; even
the ugliest person will not deny it.</p><p>You can say to the most stupid person, 'You are simply a great
Buddha, a great wise man, and he will 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on

to you 'You are the only intelligent person because you have recognised
me. Fools don't recognise me.' That's why it is easy to buttress people
--</p><p>because nobody denies anything. The ego is always hankering to be
supported. And knowledge is one of the greatest supports of the ego, so
one goes on believing in things because it creates knowledgeability.</p><p>There are Christians, Hindus and Mohammedans and Buddhists and almost
everybody belongs to some religion, to some political ideology --
communist, socialist, fascist. These are people who know nothing, but
they believe because belief gives them the idea that they know -- and
everybody wants to be in the know.</p><p>Belief is the cheapest way, at no cost. And the person who believes
in end... look at him when he comes across a person who does not believe
in god, see how superior he feels, that 'I believe in god and you don't
believe in god.' He really feels great sympathy for you, pity for you
that you will fall in hell, that you will not be saved. Deep down he
says 'poor fellow.' He himself is in the same state, but the belief
hides his ignorance. And hiding is not getting rid of; it is in a way
really protecting.</p><p>My sannyasins have to be open -- no belief, no belief system,,neither
against nor for. Religious, political</p><p>-- all kinds of ideologies have to be put aside so that you can move
with a clarity, an innocence, a childlike innocence. And that is
meditation: to remain open, silent, aware, watchful, so that you can see
whatsoever is the case. You don't project anything on it. Because you
don't have any belief you cannot project, you can see that which is. And
that is the meaning of darshana.</p><p>In the East we don't have any word with exactly the same meaning as
philosophy. In the East philosophy is called darshana, but it has a
totally different meaning.</p><p>Philosophy means thinking about truth and darshana means seeing the
truth, not</p><p>thinking. What can you think about the truth? What can the blind man
think about light? What can the deaf think about music? It is impossible
to thing anything. What is needed is not thinking but a restoration of
your eyes so that you can see, an opening of your eyes so that you can
see. Only seeing liberates.</p><p>And it is not so difficult as people think it is. It is not so
difficult. Once you decide that you will not believe unless you know, it
becomes very easy. Once all the rubbish, the rotten accumulation of
beliefs, is removed you have a clarity, a transparency, and you start
seeing things as they are. And that's what god is.</p><p>The word 'god' is a code word; it does not mean anything literally,
it is a code word. G stands for that, O</p><p>stands for which, and D stands for is -- that which is. That is the
meaning of the word 'god'. It has no literal meaning at all, it is
simply a code word: that which is. And the only way to know it is to
have clean eyes.</p><p>Meditation helps you to remove all garbage and makes you capable of
seeing. And the moment you see, you are liberated, because the moment
you see, it is your own truth, it is not borrowed, and only your own
truth can become liberation. It is bliss and it is love and it is
prayer, because when one is free there is bliss and when there is bliss
one wants to share it. It is a natural phenomenon, to share it. And
that's what love is: sharing of your bliss.</p><p>Freedom brings bliss, bliss brings love, then life becomes a
fulfilment, a deep contentment.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:justify id=i-am-not-as-thunk-as-you-drink-i-am>I Am Not As Thunk As You Drink

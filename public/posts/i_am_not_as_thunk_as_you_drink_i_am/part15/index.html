It is for reference purposes only.]\n(Osho explains to an Indian woman -- a lawyer working in Nairobi -- his concept of sannyas as opposed to the old idea.)\nThe old idea is basically life-negative. My approach is absolutely life- affirmative. To me life is god, hence life has not to be renounced but lived intensely, passionately, totally. It is only by going deeper into life that one can come to god -- there is no other way.\nThe old idea was cowardly, it was rooted in fear. It was escapist, and escaping from the challenging world is missing the whole opportunity of being born into it. God gives the whole opportunity of life in existence and we renounce it. We are trying to prove that god is wrong. The opportunity has to be used because only by using it will we become enriched. Our intelligence will be sharpened, our being will be integrated. The more one passes through the storms of life, the more one becomes centred. The only way to go beyond life is to go through it.\nSecondly, the old idea of sannyas was to impose certain rules and regulations upon yourself, to try to cultivate a character. I am against cultivating a character. Character should come spontaneously. A cultivated character is a pseudo thing -- it has to be avoided. It is false; it may look like the real coin but it is not the real\ncoin, it may even look golden but it is not gold. And never forget the old proverb: All that glitters is not gold.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nIf you cultivate a character of course you will be respectable, but respectability nourishes the ego and nothing else -- and ego is the problem. You will be honoured by people, you will be thought of as a sage or a saint, a holy man or woman. But deceiving others is not going to help ultimately. Before god you will be standing naked, naked of all cultivated character. You will have to show your true colours. So it is better not to miss the precious time, not to waste the precious time in false coins. When the real can be found why settle for the false?\nAnd thirdly, because my sannyas is not escapist and because it does not approve of any cultivated character, any morality, it has to depend on only one thing, and that is meditation. So my whole idea of sannyas is synonymous with meditation. The whole energy has to be put into only one thing: how to be silent, and silent in the noisy world, how to be without mind in the thick, crowded marketplace.\nIt is easy to be silent in the Himalayas; the Himalayas give you the false idea that the silence is yours; it is simply part of the Himalayas. You can live in the borrowed glory, but when you come back down to the world it will all be gone, it will be shattered.\nSo I am not in favour of moving into certain situations whore silence is easy. Rather, live in all the situations where silence is really difficult. Take the difficulty as a challenge. And it is not destructive to silence. Once you know how to create meditativeness, how to create awareness, once you know how to watch your mind in a cool dispassionate way, then nothing distracts you. And when nothing distracts only then is something real there.\nIf these three things are remembered then nothing else is needed. One comes slowly, gradually, to the ultimate resting place, to the full-stop of all birth and death. One becomes part of the whole and the eternal\n-- and that is the goal.\n(Osho says about purity what he had said earlier this month about compassion -- that it can be cultivated as part of one's character or be the natural outcome of meditation. He addresses Dhyan Kathryn.) Morality cannot transform your being. It is just a kind of painted face, it is a beautiful mask. The problem is that one can be deceived by it. Others will be deceived -- that's simple because they will see your mask as your face -- but if you live with the mask long enough and you never know your original face without the mask, then there is the danger that you may get deceived by it yourself; you may start thinking that you are it.And that's a great tragedy because you are not it. It is not your original face, you have simply made it.\nThe second and the right approach is not through morality but through meditation. Meditation means discovering your original face first. The most fundamental thing for a sannyasin is to discover his original face. The Zen people say discover the face that you had before your parents were born -- not just before you were born but before your parents were born -- or discover the face you will have when you die and your body is burned and nothing is loft. Discover what face you will have then. And that is your face own now.\nThat which was with you before birth and that which will be after death is there like an undercurrent and that is your true reality. And it can be discovered.\nIt is just like water underneath the earth: you can make a well, you can dig a well and you can find the undercurrent of water.Just a few layers of the earth have to be removed.\nThe process of morality and meditation are opposite, diametrically opposite. In morality you go on putting more layers upon yourself, in meditation you start discarding layers. In meditation you discard, in morality you accumulate. In meditation you are just doing the same thing as when you peel an onion -- it is a peeling. Layer by layer you go on throwing away until nothing is left.\nBuddha is reported to have said that your hands are full only when nothing is left. And he is right. When the onion has been peeled totally and all the layers have been thrown away then what is left? But that nothing is your original face and that nothing is absolute purity. Not a cultivated purity but a spontaneous purity welling up from your deepest core.\nAt the deepest core we are just absolute so pure -- pure space. And once that pure space is discovered your whole life is transformed. Then whatsoever is right is done spontaneously and whatsoever is not right i8 not done spontaneously. There are no commandments guiding you. You have clear vision, you have your own perspective; you go accordingly.\nA truly religious person is absolutely free from all outer commandments, who is moral but in a totally different sense from the so-called moralists. His morality is not imposed, it is spontaneous. And whenever something is spontaneous it has tremendous beauty.\nThese three qualities are associated with the name of Kathryn: first is beauty, second is grace, third is 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\ndevotion. If one discovers one's original face for the first time one knows one's beauty and the tremendous gift of god and one feels the grace -- because we don't deserve it and god goes on showering more and more gifts.\nWhen you are absolutely empty then gifts go on arriving every moment from all directions and dimensions. One cannot be thankful enough; the grace is infinite. And out of this beauty and the experience of grace, devotion arises. That devotion is neither Christian nor Hindu nor Mohammedan, it has nothing to do with any creed, any dogma, any priesthood. One simply feels like bowing down to existence -- to the trees, to the stars, to the moon, to the sun. One feels so grateful that there is nothing to say; all words fall short. One cannot even utter a prayer. One is prayerful but one cannot say a prayer; saying anything seems to be so futile, so inadequate. That is devotion.\nDevotion is prayerfulness, so deep and so profound, so overflowing, that language, mind, thoughts, are left far behind. It is such a flood of love that it takes away everything. One is washed totally clean. This is the new birth Jesus calls the second childhood.\nJesus says unless you are born again you shall not enter into my kingdom of god.\nThis is the birth he is talking about. Sannyas has to be just the beginning of this birth process.\n(Prem Gabriele means love is the messenger of god, Osho likens love to a rainbow because it is a bridge between the earth and the heavens.)\nIt is only through love that one can understand what god is. And when one's love is perfect then one becomes a vehicle for god in the world. Then whatsoever one says is divine, whatsoever one does is divine, then whatsoever one is, is divine.\nTo be a messenger of god simply means to be full of love. It is so simple and so natural to be full of love but we go on missing because we put so many conditions on love. And love can exist only unconditionally.\nThe moment you put a condition on it you have already poisoned it. The moment you demand something out of love you are butchering it, killing it.\nEverybody wants to love and everybody wants to be loved but very rarely have people experienced the joy of love, the music of love, the godliness of love -- very rarely, for the simple reason that everybody learns love from the parents. They don't know what love is and they go on putting conditions on the small child.\nThe mother says 'If you do this only then will I know that you love me. If you don't do this then it is certain that you don't have any love for me. Love me because I am your mother.' There is a because; they go on giving motives for love. And the child is not left to himself so that he can love when he feels like loving; ho has to pretend. When he does not feel like loving he has to create a facade because the mother is powerful and the father is powerful and he has to show his love. So rather than being loving he becomes a showman, he becomes a diplomat, a politician. Each child is destroyed by the parents, converted into a politician. He starts learning the tricks of how to pretend, how to smile.\nWhen the child smiles at the mother she good, and the child starts knowing that if he wants to do business with his mother he has to smile. The truth is something else. Why the child smiles for the first time has been a long-debated question. My own understanding is that the moment his eyes become fixed and for the first time he sees his mother and his father, they look so ridiculous that he starts laughing. It is nothing else.\nBut the mother feels great and the father feels great: look -- their child is smiling at them. They don't know the real thing, otherwise they would feel very angry about why the child is smiling. But by and by the child learns that a smile is like a bribe. He is helpless and his parents exploit his helplessness. They go on putting their numbers on the child. By the time he becomes strong enough to stand on his own legs he has already been corrupted.\nNow for the whole of his life he will go on playing games and he will never know authentic love. Of course he will be miserable because without love you cannot be blissful. Of course he will not have any sense of god. He may believe in god and he may go to the church and to the temple -- because that has also been imposed on him, that he is a Christian or a Hindu, that he has to go to church; he will say his prayers.\nIt will all become routine and ritual and he will perform it. It gives him a good feeling that he is doing everything that is expected of him. But it is not related to his being; hence his life becomes a hypocrisy.\nMy sannyasins have to unlearn all these tricks that they had to learn in their childhood. All that childhood have to be erased totally, cancelled, so that one can become innocent again and one can start from ABC.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nAnd even once if a little bit of real love happens to you, you will be surprised how much joy it brings and how much awareness and how much meaning and significance -- and one has moved towards god. God is the ultimate meaning.\nLove is the beginning of the journey and god is the end of the journey.\n(Osho gives the college professor from America the name Ma Anand Pritama, and explains its meaning, that in being blissful one becomes a beloved of existence.) The miserable person has to live a lonely life. Existence cannot commune with the miserable person, the trees cannot say hello to him, the stars\ncannot whisper to him, the winds cannot dance around him. He is so miserable that the whole existence is bound to ignore him.\nMisery is bound to be ignored, at the most tolerated, because the whole existence is full of bliss and to be miserable is to be out of step. Where everybody is dancing and singing and you are just sitting like a Christian saint or a Hindu holy man, you are out of step. These dancers and singers can at the most tolerate you. They will have to ignore you because even your presence is annoying, it is irritating.\nJust think of a Christian saint sitting in the middle of my sannyasins. My sannyasins can at the most do one thing -- forget all about him, because his very presence will be an irritant. He will be sitting there, holier-than-thou, egoistic, a deep condemnation in his eyes. The miserable person is always in deep condemnation. He cannot be grateful, he cannot be respectful, he cannot accept the other person's individuality; he wants to impose himself on them. He is miserable and he wants everybody else to be miserable too, only then can he be happy.\nThe moment you are blissful the whole existence starts coming closer to you. You are becoming part of the dance, you are joining the dance. Hence my whole effort here is to help you to be blissful, to help you to laugh with existence -- with no desire to impose yourself upon anybody. Living moment to moment rejoicing in small things is what sannyas is all about. And then miracles start happening. The whole existence starts pouring its love on you. One becomes a beloved only by being blissful.\n(Nirmal Premo -- innocent love.)\nLove cannot be calculating. If it is it is not love. It can only be innocent, uncalculating, illogical. Love cannot be cunning and clever; it is really a mad affair. But blessed are those who are capable of being madly in love with existence because those are the few chosen people who come to know the ultimate truth. Truth is not known through logic, it is not known by the philosophers; it is known only by the lovers.\nBut love has to be innocent. Love has to be just an opening of the heart in trust, risking -- because there is a danger that you may be exploited. But my observation is it is better to be exploited than to be cunning, it is better to be\nbetrayed than to be cunning. One loses nothing by being exploited or being betrayed; one loses certainly something by being cunning.\nWhat can people exploit? Maybe they can take your money, maybe they can steal your clothes, maybe you will not have so many gadgets, you may not have a big house to live in -- but these are non-essential things. But you will have a bigger soul if not a bigger house, you will have a richer soul if not a richer bank balance. And that is of real value.\nSo I suggest to my sannyasins: be innocent. Even if you are destroyed by the cunning world that is nothing to be worried about, because by being innocent you will find the indestructible in you, you will find god. And it is worth risking everything for that.\nSannyas is an adventure in love, in trust, in surrender. It is not for the cowards; it is only for the courageous few.\nBe courageous and you will be rewarded infinitely, but those rewards will be of the inner kingdom.\n(A man without meditation is like a house without a light, Osho tells Jyoti Dhyan.) With meditation your inner light starts burning, your being becomes a flame, exactly, literally a flame --\nand it is no ordinary flame either. It has a few extraordinary things about it. One is that it burns but it has no fuel, hence it cannot be extinguished. Once it is there it is forever.\nSecondly, it is smokeless, it does not create any smoke. Smoke is created only by the fuel. The more refined the fuel is the less smoke is created; the cruder the fuel, the more smoke. But if there is no fuel at all there is no smoke. Meditation is a flame without smoke, hence it gives you an absolute clarity.\nOnce the light is there inside you your whole world becomes luminous. Nothing changes on the outside, everything remains the same, yet it is no more the same because now you can see in a totally different light 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nwhich you had never seen in before, They are the same flowers but now they have a beauty, something psychedelic; they are the same stars, the same rocks, the same rivers, but because you have a new vision, a freshness, an aliveness, the whole existence comes alive.\nThis coming alive of existence is what is meant by the word 'god'. God means the coming alive of the whole of existence. But if you are dead, if the flame is not there and you are just like a dark hole, then how can you experience god? God is light, you have to be light in your own small way. God is love, you have to be love in your own small way. God is life, you have to be alive in your own small way -- only then can life commune with life, can love commune with love, can light commune with light.\n(Osho talks again of the difference between knowledge and wisdom, but this time from a slightly different angle.)\nLove cleanses you of all rubbish -- and there is much rubbish inside. Everybody is almost a British Museum; all kinds of rubbish is collected there. They say that the British Museum has so many books that if you go on putting one book next to the other they will go around the earth three times. But that is nothing because when I see people... if you put their rubbish together it will go three hundred times around the earth.\nIt is almost infinite.\nThere are only two things that are infinite: the wisdom of a Buddha and the ignorance of a fool. These two things are infinite, there is no beginning, no end to them. But this whole nonsense can be thrown out.\nAll that is needed is a new functioning within you. Right now only the head is functioning, the heart is in a state of non-functioning. It has to be changed. The- heart has to become functioning and the head has to become non-functioning, then you are immediately transported into another world and wisdom arises. When there is wisdom you can start using the mind again, but now the mind will be a servant, not a master, because the master will have come in. Now you will be able to use the servant and now the mind can be of immense value, of great utility, but it will be a beautiful servant, a mechanism, nothing more than that.\nRight now the mechanism has become the master. The servant is pretending to be the master and the master is fast asleep in the heart. The master has to be awakened, and love is just the awakening of the heart, the awakening of trust.\nSannyas is a change of the gestalt; the energy has to move from the heart not from the head. It comes from your being, it should go through the heart. First it should be refined by your love, it should be made fragrant by your love, and then it can reach the head. Then it will have enough understanding and wisdom to use the head.\nBut society has been trying to make a special arrangement in every person: it avoids the heart, it tries to join the being and its energy directly to the head, then the head becomes the master. And nobody leaves their mastery easily, hence the meditator has to struggle, to fight, but it is a fight for freedom, it is a fight to come out of a prison.\nSannyas means that now you will dedicate your life, your energy, to this struggle for ultimate freedom.\nLogic has to be dropped and love has to be revived. The revival of love becomes a resurrection.\nI Am Not As Thunk As You Drink I Am Chapter #17\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"3700","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/i_am_not_as_thunk_as_you_drink_i_am/part15/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/i_am_not_as_thunk_as_you_drink_i_am/>I Am Not As Thunk As You Drink I Am</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>18 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;3700 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/I_Am_Not_As_Thunk_As_You_Drink_I_Am/part15.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part14>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

but lived intensely, passionately, totally. It is only by going deeper
into life that one can come to god -- there is no other way.</p><p>The old idea was cowardly, it was rooted in fear. It was escapist,
and escaping from the challenging world is missing the whole opportunity
of being born into it. God gives the whole opportunity of life in
existence and we renounce it. We are trying to prove that god is wrong.
The opportunity has to be used because only by using it will we become
enriched. Our intelligence will be sharpened, our being will be
integrated. The more one passes through the storms of life, the more one
becomes centred. The only way to go beyond life is to go through it.</p><p>Secondly, the old idea of sannyas was to impose certain rules and
regulations upon yourself, to try to cultivate a character. I am against
cultivating a character. Character should come spontaneously. A
cultivated character is a pseudo thing -- it has to be avoided. It is
false; it may look like the real coin but it is not the real</p><p>coin, it may even look golden but it is not gold. And never forget
the old proverb: All that glitters is not gold.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>If you cultivate a character of course you will be respectable, but
respectability nourishes the ego and nothing else -- and ego is the
problem. You will be honoured by people, you will be thought of as a
sage or a saint, a holy man or woman. But deceiving others is not going
to help ultimately. Before god you will be standing naked, naked of all
cultivated character. You will have to show your true colours. So it is
better not to miss the precious time, not to waste the precious time in
false coins. When the real can be found why settle for the false?</p><p>And thirdly, because my sannyas is not escapist and because it does
not approve of any cultivated character, any morality, it has to depend
on only one thing, and that is meditation. So my whole idea of sannyas
is synonymous with meditation. The whole energy has to be put into only
one thing: how to be silent, and silent in the noisy world, how to be
without mind in the thick, crowded marketplace.</p><p>It is easy to be silent in the Himalayas; the Himalayas give you the
false idea that the silence is yours; it is simply part of the
Himalayas. You can live in the borrowed glory, but when you come back
down to the world it will all be gone, it will be shattered.</p><p>So I am not in favour of moving into certain situations whore silence
is easy. Rather, live in all the situations where silence is really
difficult. Take the difficulty as a challenge. And it is not destructive
to silence. Once you know how to create meditativeness, how to create
awareness, once you know how to watch your mind in a cool dispassionate
way, then nothing distracts you. And when nothing distracts only then is
something real there.</p><p>If these three things are remembered then nothing else is needed. One
comes slowly, gradually, to the ultimate resting place, to the full-stop
of all birth and death. One becomes part of the whole and the
eternal</p><p>-- and that is the goal.</p><p>(Osho says about purity what he had said earlier this month about
compassion -- that it can be cultivated as part of one's character or be
the natural outcome of meditation. He addresses Dhyan Kathryn.) Morality
cannot transform your being. It is just a kind of painted face, it is a
beautiful mask. The problem is that one can be deceived by it. Others
will be deceived -- that's simple because they will see your mask as
your face -- but if you live with the mask long enough and you never
know your original face without the mask, then there is the danger that
you may get deceived by it yourself; you may start thinking that you are
it.And that's a great tragedy because you are not it. It is not your
original face, you have simply made it.</p><p>The second and the right approach is not through morality but through
meditation. Meditation means discovering your original face first. The
most fundamental thing for a sannyasin is to discover his original face.
The Zen people say discover the face that you had before your parents
were born -- not just before you were born but before your parents were
born -- or discover the face you will have when you die and your body is
burned and nothing is loft. Discover what face you will have then. And
that is your face own now.</p><p>That which was with you before birth and that which will be after
death is there like an undercurrent and that is your true reality. And
it can be discovered.</p><p>It is just like water underneath the earth: you can make a well, you
can dig a well and you can find the undercurrent of water.Just a few
layers of the earth have to be removed.</p><p>The process of morality and meditation are opposite, diametrically
opposite. In morality you go on putting more layers upon yourself, in
meditation you start discarding layers. In meditation you discard, in
morality you accumulate. In meditation you are just doing the same thing
as when you peel an onion -- it is a peeling. Layer by layer you go on
throwing away until nothing is left.</p><p>Buddha is reported to have said that your hands are full only when
nothing is left. And he is right. When the onion has been peeled totally
and all the layers have been thrown away then what is left? But that
nothing is your original face and that nothing is absolute purity. Not a
cultivated purity but a spontaneous purity welling up from your deepest
core.</p><p>At the deepest core we are just absolute so pure -- pure space. And
once that pure space is discovered your whole life is transformed. Then
whatsoever is right is done spontaneously and whatsoever is not right i8
not done spontaneously. There are no commandments guiding you. You have
clear vision, you have your own perspective; you go accordingly.</p><p>A truly religious person is absolutely free from all outer
commandments, who is moral but in a totally different sense from the
so-called moralists. His morality is not imposed, it is spontaneous. And
whenever something is spontaneous it has tremendous beauty.</p><p>These three qualities are associated with the name of Kathryn: first
is beauty, second is grace, third is 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>devotion. If one discovers one's original face for the first time one
knows one's beauty and the tremendous gift of god and one feels the
grace -- because we don't deserve it and god goes on showering more and
more gifts.</p><p>When you are absolutely empty then gifts go on arriving every moment
from all directions and dimensions. One cannot be thankful enough; the
grace is infinite. And out of this beauty and the experience of grace,
devotion arises. That devotion is neither Christian nor Hindu nor
Mohammedan, it has nothing to do with any creed, any dogma, any
priesthood. One simply feels like bowing down to existence -- to the
trees, to the stars, to the moon, to the sun. One feels so grateful that
there is nothing to say; all words fall short. One cannot even utter a
prayer. One is prayerful but one cannot say a prayer; saying anything
seems to be so futile, so inadequate. That is devotion.</p><p>Devotion is prayerfulness, so deep and so profound, so overflowing,
that language, mind, thoughts, are left far behind. It is such a flood
of love that it takes away everything. One is washed totally clean. This
is the new birth Jesus calls the second childhood.</p><p>Jesus says unless you are born again you shall not enter into my
kingdom of god.</p><p>This is the birth he is talking about. Sannyas has to be just the
beginning of this birth process.</p><p>(Prem Gabriele means love is the messenger of god, Osho likens love
to a rainbow because it is a bridge between the earth and the
heavens.)</p><p>It is only through love that one can understand what god is. And when
one's love is perfect then one becomes a vehicle for god in the world.
Then whatsoever one says is divine, whatsoever one does is divine, then
whatsoever one is, is divine.</p><p>To be a messenger of god simply means to be full of love. It is so
simple and so natural to be full of love but we go on missing because we
put so many conditions on love. And love can exist only
unconditionally.</p><p>The moment you put a condition on it you have already poisoned it.
The moment you demand something out of love you are butchering it,
killing it.</p><p>Everybody wants to love and everybody wants to be loved but very
rarely have people experienced the joy of love, the music of love, the
godliness of love -- very rarely, for the simple reason that everybody
learns love from the parents. They don't know what love is and they go
on putting conditions on the small child.</p><p>The mother says 'If you do this only then will I know that you love
me. If you don't do this then it is certain that you don't have any love
for me. Love me because I am your mother.' There is a because; they go
on giving motives for love. And the child is not left to himself so that
he can love when he feels like loving; ho has to pretend. When he does
not feel like loving he has to create a facade because the mother is
powerful and the father is powerful and he has to show his love. So
rather than being loving he becomes a showman, he becomes a diplomat, a
politician. Each child is destroyed by the parents, converted into a
politician. He starts learning the tricks of how to pretend, how to
smile.</p><p>When the child smiles at the mother she good, and the child starts
knowing that if he wants to do business with his mother he has to smile.
The truth is something else. Why the child smiles for the first time has
been a long-debated question. My own understanding is that the moment
his eyes become fixed and for the first time he sees his mother and his
father, they look so ridiculous that he starts laughing. It is nothing
else.</p><p>But the mother feels great and the father feels great: look -- their
child is smiling at them. They don't know the real thing, otherwise they
would feel very angry about why the child is smiling. But by and by the
child learns that a smile is like a bribe. He is helpless and his
parents exploit his helplessness. They go on putting their numbers on
the child. By the time he becomes strong enough to stand on his own legs
he has already been corrupted.</p><p>Now for the whole of his life he will go on playing games and he will
never know authentic love. Of course he will be miserable because
without love you cannot be blissful. Of course he will not have any
sense of god. He may believe in god and he may go to the church and to
the temple -- because that has also been imposed on him, that he is a
Christian or a Hindu, that he has to go to church; he will say his
prayers.</p><p>It will all become routine and ritual and he will perform it. It
gives him a good feeling that he is doing everything that is expected of
him. But it is not related to his being; hence his life becomes a
hypocrisy.</p><p>My sannyasins have to unlearn all these tricks that they had to learn
in their childhood. All that childhood have to be erased totally,
cancelled, so that one can become innocent again and one can start from
ABC.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>And even once if a little bit of real love happens to you, you will
be surprised how much joy it brings and how much awareness and how much
meaning and significance -- and one has moved towards god. God is the
ultimate meaning.</p><p>Love is the beginning of the journey and god is the end of the
journey.</p><p>(Osho gives the college professor from America the name Ma Anand
Pritama, and explains its meaning, that in being blissful one becomes a
beloved of existence.) The miserable person has to live a lonely life.
Existence cannot commune with the miserable person, the trees cannot say
hello to him, the stars</p><p>cannot whisper to him, the winds cannot dance around him. He is so
miserable that the whole existence is bound to ignore him.</p><p>Misery is bound to be ignored, at the most tolerated, because the
whole existence is full of bliss and to be miserable is to be out of
step. Where everybody is dancing and singing and you are just sitting
like a Christian saint or a Hindu holy man, you are out of step. These
dancers and singers can at the most tolerate you. They will have to
ignore you because even your presence is annoying, it is irritating.</p><p>Just think of a Christian saint sitting in the middle of my
sannyasins. My sannyasins can at the most do one thing -- forget all
about him, because his very presence will be an irritant. He will be
sitting there, holier-than-thou, egoistic, a deep condemnation in his
eyes. The miserable person is always in deep condemnation. He cannot be
grateful, he cannot be respectful, he cannot accept the other person's
individuality; he wants to impose himself on them. He is miserable and
he wants everybody else to be miserable too, only then can he be
happy.</p><p>The moment you are blissful the whole existence starts coming closer
to you. You are becoming part of the dance, you are joining the dance.
Hence my whole effort here is to help you to be blissful, to help you to
laugh with existence -- with no desire to impose yourself upon anybody.
Living moment to moment rejoicing in small things is what sannyas is all
about. And then miracles start happening. The whole existence starts
pouring its love on you. One becomes a beloved only by being
blissful.</p><p>(Nirmal Premo -- innocent love.)</p><p>Love cannot be calculating. If it is it is not love. It can only be
innocent, uncalculating, illogical. Love cannot be cunning and clever;
it is really a mad affair. But blessed are those who are capable of
being madly in love with existence because those are the few chosen
people who come to know the ultimate truth. Truth is not known through
logic, it is not known by the philosophers; it is known only by the
lovers.</p><p>But love has to be innocent. Love has to be just an opening of the
heart in trust, risking -- because there is a danger that you may be
exploited. But my observation is it is better to be exploited than to be
cunning, it is better to be</p><p>betrayed than to be cunning. One loses nothing by being exploited or
being betrayed; one loses certainly something by being cunning.</p><p>What can people exploit? Maybe they can take your money, maybe they
can steal your clothes, maybe you will not have so many gadgets, you may
not have a big house to live in -- but these are non-essential things.
But you will have a bigger soul if not a bigger house, you will have a
richer soul if not a richer bank balance. And that is of real value.</p><p>So I suggest to my sannyasins: be innocent. Even if you are destroyed
by the cunning world that is nothing to be worried about, because by
being innocent you will find the indestructible in you, you will find
god. And it is worth risking everything for that.</p><p>Sannyas is an adventure in love, in trust, in surrender. It is not
for the cowards; it is only for the courageous few.</p><p>Be courageous and you will be rewarded infinitely, but those rewards
will be of the inner kingdom.</p><p>(A man without meditation is like a house without a light, Osho tells
Jyoti Dhyan.) With meditation your inner light starts burning, your
being becomes a flame, exactly, literally a flame --</p><p>and it is no ordinary flame either. It has a few extraordinary things
about it. One is that it burns but it has no fuel, hence it cannot be
extinguished. Once it is there it is forever.</p><p>Secondly, it is smokeless, it does not create any smoke. Smoke is
created only by the fuel. The more refined the fuel is the less smoke is
created; the cruder the fuel, the more smoke. But if there is no fuel at
all there is no smoke. Meditation is a flame without smoke, hence it
gives you an absolute clarity.</p><p>Once the light is there inside you your whole world becomes luminous.
Nothing changes on the outside, everything remains the same, yet it is
no more the same because now you can see in a totally different light

they have a beauty, something psychedelic; they are the same stars, the
same rocks, the same rivers, but because you have a new vision, a
freshness, an aliveness, the whole existence comes alive.</p><p>This coming alive of existence is what is meant by the word 'god'.
God means the coming alive of the whole of existence. But if you are
dead, if the flame is not there and you are just like a dark hole, then
how can you experience god? God is light, you have to be light in your
own small way. God is love, you have to be love in your own small way.
God is life, you have to be alive in your own small way -- only then can
life commune with life, can love commune with love, can light commune
with light.</p><p>(Osho talks again of the difference between knowledge and wisdom, but
this time from a slightly different angle.)</p><p>Love cleanses you of all rubbish -- and there is much rubbish inside.
Everybody is almost a British Museum; all kinds of rubbish is collected
there. They say that the British Museum has so many books that if you go
on putting one book next to the other they will go around the earth
three times. But that is nothing because when I see people... if you put
their rubbish together it will go three hundred times around the
earth.</p><p>It is almost infinite.</p><p>There are only two things that are infinite: the wisdom of a Buddha
and the ignorance of a fool. These two things are infinite, there is no
beginning, no end to them. But this whole nonsense can be thrown
out.</p><p>All that is needed is a new functioning within you. Right now only
the head is functioning, the heart is in a state of non-functioning. It
has to be changed. The- heart has to become functioning and the head has
to become non-functioning, then you are immediately transported into
another world and wisdom arises. When there is wisdom you can start
using the mind again, but now the mind will be a servant, not a master,
because the master will have come in. Now you will be able to use the
servant and now the mind can be of immense value, of great utility, but
it will be a beautiful servant, a mechanism, nothing more than that.</p><p>Right now the mechanism has become the master. The servant is
pretending to be the master and the master is fast asleep in the heart.
The master has to be awakened, and love is just the awakening of the
heart, the awakening of trust.</p><p>Sannyas is a change of the gestalt; the energy has to move from the
heart not from the head. It comes from your being, it should go through
the heart. First it should be refined by your love, it should be made
fragrant by your love, and then it can reach the head. Then it will have
enough understanding and wisdom to use the head.</p><p>But society has been trying to make a special arrangement in every
person: it avoids the heart, it tries to join the being and its energy
directly to the head, then the head becomes the master. And nobody
leaves their mastery easily, hence the meditator has to struggle, to
fight, but it is a fight for freedom, it is a fight to come out of a
prison.</p><p>Sannyas means that now you will dedicate your life, your energy, to
this struggle for ultimate freedom.</p><p>Logic has to be dropped and love has to be revived. The revival of
love becomes a resurrection.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:justify id=i-am-not-as-thunk-as-you-drink-i-am>I Am Not As Thunk As You Drink

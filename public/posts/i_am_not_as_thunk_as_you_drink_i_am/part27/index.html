Osho describes what he refers to as the map of sannyas\n-- the journey from sex to prayer.\nMan has many centers in his being. The most important centers are seven. The lowest is the sex center 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nand the highest is called sahasrar, the one-thousand-petalled lotus. Between the two, exactly in the middle, is the heart. So these three out of the seven are the most significant. The energy has to move from the sex center towards the heart center. Unless it happens one remains a slave to one's instincts.\nSexuality is the greatest slavery because it dominates you through biology. You\nare not the master of it; you are under the deep slavery of chemistry, biology, nature. The energy has to move from the sex center towards the heart. The moment it becomes love the heart opens. That is the first victory, the beginning of a victorious life.\nTo live confined to the world of sex is to live an animal existence, it is to live just as physiology, nothing more. To live through the heart is to live like man, a human being, transcending animal, transcending the lower, transcending that which binds you, keeps you imprisoned. And once the energy has moved to the heart then the remaining half journey is not difficult. The first part is the most difficult part because you have to do the first part -- the second part is done by God's grace.\nOne becomes entitled to the second part if one has fulfilled the first part. The moment your energy reaches to the heart center then nothing is needed on your part. Then miracles start happening and the energy goes on rising higher and higher and one day it touches the ultimate center, the seventh, where prayer happens. Sex is the lowest, prayer is the highest; exactly in the middle is the center of love.\nThis is the whole map for a sannyasin: from sex to love, from love to prayer -- and the pilgrimage is complete, one has arrived home.\n(To Dick Osho speaks of the difference between the soldier and the sannyasin.) For the whole past of humanity we have praised the quality of being hard because the soldier, the warrior, has dominated the scene. War has been going on continuously: in three thousand years we have fought five thousand wars. Naturally, the soldier was the most important person. The past belongs to the soldier, but the future does not belong to the soldier at all. The soldier is finished, he is already living a post-mortem existence because science has developed the technology of destruction to its ultimate: within ten minutes the whole earth can be destroyed. And we have piled up atomic weapons so much that we can destroy seven hundred planets like this earth or -- to put it another way -- we can kill every person seven hundred times.\nNow war is impossible. Small battles can go on -- like Iraq fighting Iran... very small battles -- just because of old habit, just because it is an old routine, otherwise war is no more possible. The third world war is not going to happen unless man decides to commit suicide, a global suicide. The soldier is finished.\nHe will linger on the scene a little while, creating small wars here and there just to keep himself engaged...\nand the stupid generals with all their gold medals to brag about. But it has all become stupid, it is utterly stupid. In fact the generals with all those gold medals look foolish -- clowns. They should be preserved in museums or presented in circuses, otherwise there is no use for them.\nThe future belongs to the sannyasin, but the sannyasin has to live a totally different life from the soldier.\nThe most important quality in the soldier was hardness, and the most important quality in a sannyasin is tenderness. The soldier was destructive, the sannyasin has to be creative. The soldier hankered for war, the sannyasin has only one longing: to fill the whole earth with the perfume of love.\n(A challenge lies within the taking of sannyas. Osho tells Anand Bernd what it is.) Bliss is the beginning of a new life. Ordinarily man lives in misery -- that is an old gestalt, an old pattern. Your parents lived in misery, and their parents and their parents' parents too; you can go back to the very beginning, to Adam and Eve. They also must have lived in misery. If they were really living in bliss the serpent would not have been able to seduce them. A blissful person is untemptable. What can you offer to tempt him? -- he has got it already.\nThen of course the problem arises, a theological problem: why did Adam believe that he lived in paradise if he was miserable? The only reason that I can find is that he had no mother-in-law. (laughter) That may be the only reason why he believed that he lived in paradise, otherwise there seems to be no reason. He lived naked and only one woman was there. What kind of paradise was that? And even that woman.… every night when he came back home and fell asleep, she would count his ribs! (laughter) She was created out of a rib -- if another rib were missing that meant some other was around somewhere! (much laughter) It was not much of a paradise.\nHe must have been miserable, utterly miserable, hence the serpent was able to tempt him with something better. The salesman can only tempt you with something better if you are fed up with your car or 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nwith your house... otherwise nobody can tempt you.\nSo from Adam and Eve downwards every generation has lived in misery and every generation has given its misery to the new generation. That is our way of life on earth -- at least up to now that has been our way of life. It is time that some new gestalt should emerge, some new way of life.\nTo me the sannyasin has to prove that there is a possibility of living in a new way -- blissfully, musically, lovingly, in a sheer dance. That is the challenge of sannyas.\n(And living life in a new way is knowing its intrinsic sacredness, Osho goes on to say.) Life in all its multi-dimensionality, in all its totality, is sacred. And there is nothing else other than life, no god separate from life. The very idea of god as separate from life has created trouble because then god is sacred and life becomes unsacred. Then to choose life means to deny god. Or to choose god means to go against life.\nI want to destroy that separation between god and life. I want to declare to everybody that life is god, there is no other god, only then can we create a new man who will not be schizophrenic.\nThe old man was schizophrenic, because naturally he wanted to live life joyously but there was guilt, in every joy there was guilt All joys were poisoned by the priests because they were continuously saying,\n'Remember, god has to be found and you have to sacrifice this life totally, only then can you find god.' To rejoice in life was a sin; it was to be materialist, to be worldly. In every possible way the so-called saints have been condemning life.\nNaturally, if you lived life you felt a deep guilt; if you followed the saints it was unnatural and artificial so you became sad. Either way you were a loser. This is creating a split in man, this is the root cause of all schizophrenia. And to me, schizophrenia is not a disease that happens to only a few people. Who whole of humility is more or less schizophrenic.\nIt cannot be one because it has two goals and both are attractive.\nYou must have heard the famous ancient fable, a donkey died because he starved himself. It was not that food was not available. There were two piles of green grass by his side at the same distance from him -- one was on the left, one was on the right. He died because he could not choose. When he wanted to go to the left he felt the right side to be greener. That's how it always is: the grass is green on your neighbour's lawn, not on your own lawn -- and your neighbour thinks the same.\nWhen the donkey moved towards the left the right was very attractive, so he would start moving towards the right, and then suddenly he would see that the left grass was greener. And the poor donkey simply died.\nHe could not decide -- he must have been a philosopher! He died out of indecision. And that's how humanity has been behaving.\nIf you become religious life seems to be very attractive, more attractive to you than to the people who are living it. The farther you go away, the more attractive it becomes. If you live life then the saints look very attractive -- their silence, their purity, their holiness. And ultimately they are going to enjoy the heavenly pleasures and you will be down in hell burning and burning forever, for eternity, so naturally it feels attractive. But if you become a saint then suddenly there is all sadness, all juice disappears, you become just a desert and everybody else seems to be enjoying life.\nThis has been the problem up to now. I want to destroy it from the very roots. My sannyasins have to know one basic truth, that life is god. I worship life! So there is no question of choice. One can enjoy life with total abandon because that is how one is going to find god.\nThe only way to find god is through life. God is the innermost core of life. Life is the outside of god and god is the inside of life.\n(We're all messengers of truth dispatched to earth by god -- but we get distracted, Osho tells Satyo Angelika.)\nWe forget from where we are coming, why we are here and where we are going. We forget everything!\nThis is in a way natural, because our coming down from the beyond is like somebody descending from the sunlit peaks of Everest into a dark, dark valley. The journey is long and as he comes down lower he starts becoming accustomed to the darkness. He has to become accustomed to it because he has to live with it. By the time he reaches the valley he has forgotten all about the sunlit peaks; or maybe if he remembers them then they look like dreams, not like realities -- fantasies. It is as if one has heard about them or dreamt about them or read about them in a novel or seen them in a movie. But the journey is long, and it is very natural to forget.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nComing from the ultimate source of light is really an arduous journey. Entering into the womb of the mother is the greatest fall. One cannot go below that; it is the darkest place possible. And then in living nine months in that darkness one forgets all about light; and then one is born.\nIn the East we have a legend that even after birth the child remembers something of god till he starts speaking. By the time he becomes capable of speaking he has forgotten everything. He has started learning the ways of the world -- the language of the world, the behavior. And we condition the child in every possible way. Slowly slowly he forgets everything; he becomes unaware of himself. And that's how millions of people live and die. Their whole life is a sheer exercise in futility. They gain nothing, they discover nothing, they rejoice in nothing, they don't come to feel any truth. And if you cannot feel your own truth how can you share it with others? And that is the basic purpose of our coming into the world -- to bring something of god from the beyond and share it.\nIt has to be rediscovered. We have to destroy all the barriers that have grown around it. And that's the whole process of sannyas: sannyas means a total process of deconditioning. Whosoever someone is --\nChristian, Hindu, Mohammedan, German, Japanese -- it does not matter; we have to decondition him. The Christian will have to be deconditioned as well as\nthe Hindu, as well as the Mohammedan. We will have to destroy all that has grown around your natural self. And once all the barriers are removed a great joy arises.\nSuddenly one recollects who one is and what one's purpose is here.\nIn that very moment life becomes significant because you have come to your own truth -- and that is god's message. Then you can share it with others, then you can also help others.\nMy effort here is to create as many sannyasins as possible so they can be spread all over the world and they can start triggering many many people into self- discovery. I am not creating a church or a creed, I am simply emphasizing a process. If one passes through that process one will come to one's own natural self.\nThat is our truth, and that's also god's truth, because truths cannot be separate; our truth and god's truth are the same.\nTruth is one, but first it has to be discovered within oneself, only then can we see it in others too. And if you can discover it within yourself you can help others because the process is the same.\n(Meditation is pure mirroring, Osho tells Dhyan Lole. And Lole is a form of Violet.) The colour violet symbolically represents two things: one is humbleness and second is love for truth.\nBoth these things become possible in meditation and only in meditation, there is no other way.\nThe moment there are no thoughts the ego disappears -- because ego is only a thought. And then there is humbleness. When the mind is not there truth is revealed, because mind is the only barrier. When thinking disappears truth arrives.\n(Prem Prakash means love for light.)\nLight represents consciousness, and we are living in a state of unconsciousness. We are really sleep walkers full of dreams. And if you listen quietly, you can hear people snoring even when they are walking.\nThey look awake, but they are not. Certainly their souls are snoring; the body goes on doing its work mechanically.\nLove for light means love for consciousness. And that's the goal of sannyas: transforming darkness into light, transforming unconsciousness into consciousness. The moment your whole unconscious continent, the dark continent inside you, the Africa within, becomes full of light -- when the sun rises inside -- life takes on a totally new meaning, a new joy, a new fragrance. It is a rebirth. And it is possible because the person who can be unconscious can be conscious too.\nOnly the dead person cannot be conscious, because he is dead. And he cannot be unconscious either.\nThe possibilities of unconsciousness and consciousness exist together; hence there is great hope. Because we are unconscious, the hope is that we can be conscious. And the whole religious effort depends on this hope. Up to now only very few people have been able to transform their darkness into light. But those few people are enough proof that every man has the same potential. Just a little work upon oneself is needed, just a little respect for oneself.\nGive the world twenty-three hours of your day, and give to yourself only one hour of your day, and that will do. Finally, you will be surprised that those twenty-three hours have gone in vain and only that one hour that you gave to yourself for the work upon yourself has been saved.\n(Dhyan Navya. Dhyan means meditation. Navya means new.) 1/08/07 Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nMeditation is an end and a beginning -- the end of the old and the birth of the new. You cannot even comprehend it because the old cannot comprehend the new, the old can only comprehend something which is old. It has limitations, it can move only within the boundary of the known, and the new is not within its boundary, the new is unknown. Hence only very courageous people can take the jump.\nCourage is needed because you have to die to the old, and the old is familiar. You are dropping that which is familiar for something which is absolutely unfamiliar. This is what courage is: dropping the known for the unknown.\nThere are two steps to courage: the first is dropping the known for the unknown, and the second is dropping the knowable for the unknowable. By dropping the known for the unknown, meditation happens.\nAnd by dropping the knowable for the unknowable -- samadhi, the ultimate form of meditation, beyond which nothing exists.\nMeditation is the beginning of samadhi. There is no word in English for samadhi. Samadhi means all problems have disappeared, all thoughts have died, the ego is no longer there. One has become immersed with the whole, just like a dewdrop slipping from a lotus leaf into the lake. In a way it disappears; in another way it becomes the very lake.\n(Love is prayer -- that is the meaning of her new name, Osho tells the American counsellor.) Love is prayer, hence no temple is needed, no church is needed. Wherever, on whomsoever, you shower your love it is prayer. You can give the prayer to the tree, to people, to the river, to the rock, to the sun, to the moon -- the whole universe becomes your temple. And wherever you sit prayerfully, lovingly, feelingly, sensitively, it is prayer.\nPrayer has nothing to do with words; it is a silent gratitude towards existence, utterly silent. To say something will be a disturbance in prayer. Not to say anything is far better, because words are very inadequate and all lovers know it.\nWhen you say to somebody 'I love you' immediately you recognise that what you wanted to say has not been said. 'I love you' does not contain that which you wanted to convey. It becomes very ordinary --\nexpressed, everything becomes very ordinary. Hence lovers really don't say to each other, 'I love you.'\nMy own observation is that when love dies then they start saying to each other 'I love you,' because now the real thing has evaporated. Somehow they can go on making the old lies with which they have become accustomed to live -- the security, the safety, the convenience of it and all the promises that they have given to each other. My feeling is that only husbands and wives say to each other\n'I love you.' And whenever anybody says 'I love you,' that means it is the end, so it is better to say goodbye rather than to go on unnecessarily torturing each other. That is a kind of nagging -- 'I love you.'\nWhen there is really love there is silence. When two lovers sit together there is silence -- it is enough.\nThere is communion, heart-to-heart, the mind does not interfere at all. The mind means words, language, expression; the heart simply means a silent feel.\nAnd it is true even on a wider scale, true as far as prayer is concerned, because you are starting a dialogue with the beyond. Now words are absolutely meaningless. The beyond can understand only the language of silence.\nSo be love-full, overflowing, but remain silent. Let the heart say it in its own way. There is no need for the head to come in. And only then does prayer reach the very core of existence. Silence is the bridge.\nI Am Not As Thunk As You Drink I Am Chapter #29\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"3451","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/i_am_not_as_thunk_as_you_drink_i_am/part27/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/i_am_not_as_thunk_as_you_drink_i_am/>I Am Not As Thunk As You Drink I Am</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>17 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;3451 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/I_Am_Not_As_Thunk_As_You_Drink_I_Am/part27.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part26>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

chemistry, biology, nature. The energy has to move from the sex center
towards the heart. The moment it becomes love the heart opens. That is
the first victory, the beginning of a victorious life.</p><p>To live confined to the world of sex is to live an animal existence,
it is to live just as physiology, nothing more. To live through the
heart is to live like man, a human being, transcending animal,
transcending the lower, transcending that which binds you, keeps you
imprisoned. And once the energy has moved to the heart then the
remaining half journey is not difficult. The first part is the most
difficult part because <em>you</em> have to do the first part -- the
second part is done by God's grace.</p><p>One becomes entitled to the second part if one has fulfilled the
first part. The moment your energy reaches to the heart center then
nothing is needed on your part. Then miracles start happening and the
energy goes on rising higher and higher and one day it touches the
ultimate center, the seventh, where prayer happens. Sex is the lowest,
prayer is the highest; exactly in the middle is the center of love.</p><p>This is the whole map for a sannyasin: from sex to love, from love to
prayer -- and the pilgrimage is complete, one has arrived home.</p><p>(To Dick Osho speaks of the difference between the soldier and the
sannyasin.) For the whole past of humanity we have praised the quality
of being hard because the soldier, the warrior, has dominated the scene.
War has been going on continuously: in three thousand years we have
fought five thousand wars. Naturally, the soldier was the most important
person. The past belongs to the soldier, but the future does not belong
to the soldier at all. The soldier is finished, he is already living a
post-mortem existence because science has developed the technology of
destruction to its ultimate: within ten minutes the whole earth can be
destroyed. And we have piled up atomic weapons so much that we can
destroy seven hundred planets like this earth or -- to put it another
way -- we can kill every person seven hundred times.</p><p>Now war is impossible. Small battles can go on -- like Iraq fighting
Iran... very small battles -- just because of old habit, just because it
is an old routine, otherwise war is no more possible. The third world
war is not going to happen unless man decides to commit suicide, a
global suicide. The soldier is finished.</p><p>He will linger on the scene a little while, creating small wars here
and there just to keep himself engaged...</p><p>and the stupid generals with all their gold medals to brag about. But
it has all become stupid, it is utterly stupid. In fact the generals
with all those gold medals look foolish -- clowns. They should be
preserved in museums or presented in circuses, otherwise there is no use
for them.</p><p>The future belongs to the sannyasin, but the sannyasin has to live a
totally different life from the soldier.</p><p>The most important quality in the soldier was hardness, and the most
important quality in a sannyasin is tenderness. The soldier was
destructive, the sannyasin has to be creative. The soldier hankered for
war, the sannyasin has only one longing: to fill the whole earth with
the perfume of love.</p><p>(A challenge lies within the taking of sannyas. Osho tells Anand
Bernd what it is.) Bliss is the beginning of a new life. Ordinarily man
lives in misery -- that is an old gestalt, an old pattern. Your parents
lived in misery, and their parents and their parents' parents too; you
can go back to the very beginning, to Adam and Eve. They also must have
lived in misery. If they were really living in bliss the serpent would
not have been able to seduce them. A blissful person is untemptable.
What can you offer to tempt him? -- he has got it already.</p><p>Then of course the problem arises, a theological problem: why did
Adam believe that he lived in paradise if he was miserable? The only
reason that I can find is that he had no mother-in-law. (laughter) That
may be the only reason why he believed that he lived in paradise,
otherwise there seems to be no reason. He lived naked and only one woman
was there. What kind of paradise was that? And even that woman.… every
night when he came back home and fell asleep, she would count his ribs!
(laughter) She was created out of a rib -- if another rib were missing
that meant some other was around somewhere! (much laughter) It was not
much of a paradise.</p><p>He must have been miserable, utterly miserable, hence the serpent was
able to tempt him with something better. The salesman can only tempt you
with something better if you are fed up with your car or 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>with your house... otherwise nobody can tempt you.</p><p>So from Adam and Eve downwards every generation has lived in misery
and every generation has given its misery to the new generation. That is
our way of life on earth -- at least up to now that has been our way of
life. It is time that some new gestalt should emerge, some new way of
life.</p><p>To me the sannyasin has to prove that there is a possibility of
living in a new way -- blissfully, musically, lovingly, in a sheer
dance. That is the challenge of sannyas.</p><p>(And living life in a new way is knowing its intrinsic sacredness,
Osho goes on to say.) Life in all its multi-dimensionality, in all its
totality, is sacred. And there is nothing else other than life, no god
separate from life. The very idea of god as separate from life has
created trouble because then god is sacred and life becomes unsacred.
Then to choose life means to deny god. Or to choose god means to go
against life.</p><p>I want to destroy that separation between god and life. I want to
declare to everybody that life is god, there is no other god, only then
can we create a new man who will not be schizophrenic.</p><p>The old man was schizophrenic, because naturally he wanted to live
life joyously but there was guilt, in every joy there was guilt All joys
were poisoned by the priests because they were continuously saying,</p><p>'Remember, god has to be found and you have to sacrifice this life
totally, only then can you find god.' To rejoice in life was a sin; it
was to be materialist, to be worldly. In every possible way the
so-called saints have been condemning life.</p><p>Naturally, if you lived life you felt a deep guilt; if you followed
the saints it was unnatural and artificial so you became sad. Either way
you were a loser. This is creating a split in man, this is the root
cause of all schizophrenia. And to me, schizophrenia is not a disease
that happens to only a few people. Who whole of humility is more or less
schizophrenic.</p><p>It cannot be one because it has two goals and both are
attractive.</p><p>You must have heard the famous ancient fable, a donkey died because
he starved himself. It was not that food was not available. There were
two piles of green grass by his side at the same distance from him --
one was on the left, one was on the right. He died because he could not
choose. When he wanted to go to the left he felt the right side to be
greener. That's how it always is: the grass is green on your neighbour's
lawn, not on your own lawn -- and your neighbour thinks the same.</p><p>When the donkey moved towards the left the right was very attractive,
so he would start moving towards the right, and then suddenly he would
see that the left grass was greener. And the poor donkey simply
died.</p><p>He could not decide -- he must have been a philosopher! He died out
of indecision. And that's how humanity has been behaving.</p><p>If you become religious life seems to be very attractive, more
attractive to you than to the people who are living it. The farther you
go away, the more attractive it becomes. If you live life then the
saints look very attractive -- their silence, their purity, their
holiness. And ultimately they are going to enjoy the heavenly pleasures
and you will be down in hell burning and burning forever, for eternity,
so naturally it feels attractive. But if you become a saint then
suddenly there is all sadness, all juice disappears, you become just a
desert and everybody else seems to be enjoying life.</p><p>This has been the problem up to now. I want to destroy it from the
very roots. My sannyasins have to know one basic truth, that life is
god. I worship life! So there is no question of choice. One can enjoy
life with total abandon because that is how one is going to find
god.</p><p>The only way to find god is through life. God is the innermost core
of life. Life is the outside of god and god is the inside of life.</p><p>(We're all messengers of truth dispatched to earth by god -- but we
get distracted, Osho tells Satyo Angelika.)</p><p>We forget from where we are coming, why we are here and where we are
going. We forget everything!</p><p>This is in a way natural, because our coming down from the beyond is
like somebody descending from the sunlit peaks of Everest into a dark,
dark valley. The journey is long and as he comes down lower he starts
becoming accustomed to the darkness. He has to become accustomed to it
because he has to live with it. By the time he reaches the valley he has
forgotten all about the sunlit peaks; or maybe if he remembers them then
they look like dreams, not like realities -- fantasies. It is as if one
has heard about them or dreamt about them or read about them in a novel
or seen them in a movie. But the journey is long, and it is very natural
to forget.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on

journey. Entering into the womb of the mother is the greatest fall. One
cannot go below that; it is the darkest place possible. And then in
living nine months in that darkness one forgets all about light; and
then one is born.</p><p>In the East we have a legend that even after birth the child
remembers something of god till he starts speaking. By the time he
becomes capable of speaking he has forgotten everything. He has started
learning the ways of the world -- the language of the world, the
behavior. And we condition the child in every possible way. Slowly
slowly he forgets everything; he becomes unaware of himself. And that's
how millions of people live and die. Their whole life is a sheer
exercise in futility. They gain nothing, they discover nothing, they
rejoice in nothing, they don't come to feel any truth. And if you cannot
feel your own truth how can you share it with others? And that is the
basic purpose of our coming into the world -- to bring something of god
from the beyond and share it.</p><p>It has to be rediscovered. We have to destroy all the barriers that
have grown around it. And that's the whole process of sannyas: sannyas
means a total process of deconditioning. Whosoever someone is --</p><p>Christian, Hindu, Mohammedan, German, Japanese -- it does not matter;
we have to decondition him. The Christian will have to be deconditioned
as well as</p><p>the Hindu, as well as the Mohammedan. We will have to destroy all
that has grown around your natural self. And once all the barriers are
removed a great joy arises.</p><p>Suddenly one recollects who one is and what one's purpose is
here.</p><p>In that very moment life becomes significant because you have come to
your own truth -- and that is god's message. Then you can share it with
others, then you can also help others.</p><p>My effort here is to create as many sannyasins as possible so they
can be spread all over the world and they can start triggering many many
people into self- discovery. I am not creating a church or a creed, I am
simply emphasizing a process. If one passes through that process one
will come to one's own natural self.</p><p>That is our truth, and that's also god's truth, because truths cannot
be separate; our truth and god's truth are the same.</p><p>Truth is one, but first it has to be discovered within oneself, only
then can we see it in others too. And if you can discover it within
yourself you can help others because the process is the same.</p><p>(Meditation is pure mirroring, Osho tells Dhyan Lole. And Lole is a
form of Violet.) The colour violet symbolically represents two things:
one is humbleness and second is love for truth.</p><p>Both these things become possible in meditation and only in
meditation, there is no other way.</p><p>The moment there are no thoughts the ego disappears -- because ego is
only a thought. And then there is humbleness. When the mind is not there
truth is revealed, because mind is the only barrier. When thinking
disappears truth arrives.</p><p>(Prem Prakash means love for light.)</p><p>Light represents consciousness, and we are living in a state of
unconsciousness. We are really sleep walkers full of dreams. And if you
listen quietly, you can hear people snoring even when they are
walking.</p><p>They look awake, but they are not. Certainly their souls are snoring;
the body goes on doing its work mechanically.</p><p>Love for light means love for consciousness. And that's the goal of
sannyas: transforming darkness into light, transforming unconsciousness
into consciousness. The moment your whole unconscious continent, the
dark continent inside you, the Africa within, becomes full of light --
when the sun rises inside -- life takes on a totally new meaning, a new
joy, a new fragrance. It is a rebirth. And it is possible because the
person who can be unconscious can be conscious too.</p><p>Only the dead person cannot be conscious, because he is dead. And he
cannot be unconscious either.</p><p>The possibilities of unconsciousness and consciousness exist
together; hence there is great hope. Because we are unconscious, the
hope is that we can be conscious. And the whole religious effort depends
on this hope. Up to now only very few people have been able to transform
their darkness into light. But those few people are enough proof that
every man has the same potential. Just a little work upon oneself is
needed, just a little respect for oneself.</p><p>Give the world twenty-three hours of your day, and give to yourself
only one hour of your day, and that will do. Finally, you will be
surprised that those twenty-three hours have gone in vain and only that
one hour that you gave to yourself for the work upon yourself has been
saved.</p><p>(Dhyan Navya. Dhyan means meditation. Navya means new.) 1/08/07

CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>Meditation is an end and a beginning -- the end of the old and the
birth of the new. You cannot even comprehend it because the old cannot
comprehend the new, the old can only comprehend something which is old.
It has limitations, it can move only within the boundary of the known,
and the new is not within its boundary, the new is unknown. Hence only
very courageous people can take the jump.</p><p>Courage is needed because you have to die to the old, and the old is
familiar. You are dropping that which is familiar for something which is
absolutely unfamiliar. This is what courage is: dropping the known for
the unknown.</p><p>There are two steps to courage: the first is dropping the known for
the unknown, and the second is dropping the knowable for the unknowable.
By dropping the known for the unknown, meditation happens.</p><p>And by dropping the knowable for the unknowable -- <em>samadhi</em>,
the ultimate form of meditation, beyond which nothing exists.</p><p>Meditation is the beginning of samadhi. There is no word in English
for <em>samadhi</em>. <em>Samadhi</em> means all problems have
disappeared, all thoughts have died, the ego is no longer there. One has
become immersed with the whole, just like a dewdrop slipping from a
lotus leaf into the lake. In a way it disappears; in another way it
becomes the very lake.</p><p>(Love is prayer -- that is the meaning of her new name, Osho tells
the American counsellor.) Love is prayer, hence no temple is needed, no
church is needed. Wherever, on whomsoever, you shower your love it is
prayer. You can give the prayer to the tree, to people, to the river, to
the rock, to the sun, to the moon -- the whole universe becomes your
temple. And wherever you sit prayerfully, lovingly, feelingly,
sensitively, it is prayer.</p><p>Prayer has nothing to do with words; it is a silent gratitude towards
existence, utterly silent. To say something will be a disturbance in
prayer. Not to say anything is far better, because words are very
inadequate and all lovers know it.</p><p>When you say to somebody 'I love you' immediately you recognise that
what you wanted to say has not been said. 'I love you' does not contain
that which you wanted to convey. It becomes very ordinary --</p><p>expressed, everything becomes very ordinary. Hence lovers really
don't say to each other, 'I love you.'</p><p>My own observation is that when love dies then they start saying to
each other 'I love you,' because now the real thing has evaporated.
Somehow they can go on making the old lies with which they have become
accustomed to live -- the security, the safety, the convenience of it
and all the promises that they have given to each other. My feeling is
that only husbands and wives say to each other</p><p>'I love you.' And whenever anybody says 'I love you,' that means it
is the end, so it is better to say goodbye rather than to go on
unnecessarily torturing each other. That is a kind of nagging -- 'I love
you.'</p><p>When there is really love there is silence. When two lovers sit
together there is silence -- it is enough.</p><p>There is communion, heart-to-heart, the mind does not interfere at
all. The mind means words, language, expression; the heart simply means
a silent feel.</p><p>And it is true even on a wider scale, true as far as prayer is
concerned, because you are starting a dialogue with the beyond. Now
words are absolutely meaningless. The beyond can understand only the
language of silence.</p><p>So be love-full, overflowing, but remain silent. Let the heart say it
in its own way. There is no need for the head to come in. And only then
does prayer reach the very core of existence. Silence is the bridge.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:justify id=i-am-not-as-thunk-as-you-drink-i-am>I Am Not As Thunk As You Drink

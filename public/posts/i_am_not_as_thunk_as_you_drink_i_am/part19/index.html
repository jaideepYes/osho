The head does not allow it to enter, the head keeps it outside.\nThe head allows only the mundane; it is not a vehicle for the sacred. For the sacred one has to open another door, another center has to start functioning. And bliss is the key to start that other center functioning. In moments of bliss the mind disappears, there is only a heart full of dance, song, celebration.\nAnd the message is immediately understood. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nMy sannyasins have to learn how to be blissful in spite of all that is disturbing. Remember that: in spite of all. There are a thousand and one things which distract, disturb, annoy, irritate. This is the whole challenge of life, not to be disturbed by it. One has to become the center of the cyclone, then the night may be dark but deep in your heart a small candle goes on burning; and that's enough\n-- enough for you to stay full of light.\nSannyas simply means a cheerful way of living -- then everything else comes on its own.\n(Osho adds 'Dhyan'' to Daniel's name, and talks of meditation in relation to the meaning of Daniel -- god is my judge.)\nDhyan means an absolute state of silence where no thought moves inside you; all the waves of the mind are gone, the consciousness has become a silent, undisturbed lake. In that very moment one becomes unafraid of the society, of the state, of the church, of all so-called outer authorities which are reducing every human being to a slave. In those moments of silence one stands naked before god. One knows that: except for god nobody is my judge.\nDaniel means god is my judge.\nThe moment you experience that only god is your judge you become fearless of all other judges, of the opinions of others. The greatest fear in the world is of the opinions of others. And the moment you are unafraid of the crowd you are no longer a sheep, you become a lion. A great roar arises in your heart, the roar of freedom.\nBuddha has actually called it the lion's roar. When a man reaches an absolutely silent state he roars like a lion. For the first time he knows what freedom is because now there is no fear of anybody's opinion. What people say does not matter. Whether they call you a saint or a sinner is immaterial; your whole and sole judge is god. And by 'god' a person is not meant at all, god simply means the whole universe.\nIt is not a question of having to face a person, you have to face the trees, the rivers, the mountains, the stars -- the whole universe. And this is our universe, we are part of it, there is no need to be afraid of it, there is no need to hide anything from it. In fact even if you try you cannot hide. The whole knows it already, the whole knows more about you than you know; hence the other\nmeaning of Daniel.\nOne meaning is god is my judge and the second is even more significant; the second is, god has already judged. It is not something that is going to happen in the future, it has already happened, he has judged. So even the fear of that judgement withers away. It is not a question of some judgement day at the end. You need not tremble. The judgement day happened on the first day; the moment he created you he already judged you. He knows you, you are his creation. If something goes wrong with you he is responsible, not you. If you go astray he is responsible, not you. How can you be responsible? -- you are not your own creation. If you paint and something goes wrong you cannot say that the painting is the cause of it -- the painter is the cause.\nSo there is no need to be afraid of the crowd or of some imaginary god at the end of the world asking you what you have done and what you have not done. He has already judged -- that is really significant -- it has already happened so you are free. And the moment one knows that one is totally free to be oneself, life starts having a dynamic quality to it.\nFear creates fetters, freedom gives you wings.\n(Bob is a college professor -- and becomes not Swami but Ma Anand Bob... because Bob's not a man but a lady!)\nBob has two meanings; one is brightness and the other is fame. Bliss brings both. As far as you are concerned it gives a tremendous upsurge to your intelligence, it removes all the hindrances, it sharpens your genius.\nEverybody is a genius. Society makes people mediocre, stupid, because society needs the mediocres and the stupids. The mediocres become the heads and the stupids become the hands. But society is very much afraid of a real genius -- of a Buddha, of a Lao Tzu, of a Jesus. It is very much afraid. A genius seems to be a danger to all vested interests -- and in fact he is. The fear is not wrongly- founded, the is right, because society is dominated by ugly interests, and the man of genius can see so clearly the whole nonsense that has been perpetuated for centuries that he immediately rebels. It is not a question of decision on his part, rebellion comes to him naturally, spontaneously. He cannot be reduced to a slave, to a commodity.\nSociety wants everybody to remain miserable. Miserable people are good,\nobedient. Miserable people are good because misery destroys their intelligence. Miserable people are good because they are always 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nmore like machines than like human beings, more efficient. And that's what the society needs, machines, not men. But the people have to suffer hell for their whole life.\nBliss opens the doors of paradise. And paradise is not somewhere above in the clouds, it is within you.\nThe moment you start feeling blissful the doors of paradise open. In fact they are always open, there is not even a Saint Peter on guard -- you just have to be blissful to enter.\nAnd of course the second meaning is also significant: whenever a person becomes blissful, without any effort he starts affecting other people's lives in some mysterious way. It is just like when a flower opens.\nSomehow the bees come to know that the flower has opened and from miles they start moving towards it. It has been recorded that from at least four miles away bees can feel the fragrance and immediately they start moving in the direction of the fragrance, towards the source of it.\nSo whenever a person becomes blissful it means a flower of consciousness has opened, and those who you are thirsty -- and who is not thirsty? -- those who are starved -- and who is not starved? -- they all start moving as if some magnetic force is pulling them.\nBliss inside creates intelligence and outside creates a tremendous attraction for all those who are seeking and searching.\n(You've got to drop knowledge to allow wisdom to surface, Osho reiterates tonight.) One has to be just like a child. It is a second childhood. Jesus says again and again 'Unless you are like small children you will not enter my\nkingdom of god.'\nThe rabbis, the pundits, the imams, the ayatollahs, the bishops, the popes -- they cannot enter the kingdom of god. Those are the people for whom a special arrangement has been made: hell. It is for V.I.P.'s, it is a V.I.P. treatment -- or\nV.V.I.P. Hell is not for poor sinners -- who cares about poor sinners? It is a five- star place. Avoid it!\nMy sannyasins have to learn how to renounce knowledge so that they can become like small children again.\n(A star of love, Osho names the former Genevieve.)\nLove is the only star in the dark night of the soul. But that one star is enough to transform everything; it can bring the day, the dawn.\nOne has to be totally loving, and the love has not to be something addressed. It has to be unaddressed like the fragrance of a flower. It is not a question of giving love to this person or that, it is a question of just being loving, and ultimately, of being just love.\nThese are the three stages: love as a relationship is the lowest, loving as a quality is higher than the first, and becoming just love -- not even a quality but love itself -- that is the highest. It is because of this that Jesus says god is love. It is the highest phenomenon, the ultimate transformation of your energy.\n(Osho speaks of god.)\nGod is not an object; it is not something separate from you; it is not something that one day can become known.\nScience divides reality into only two categories, the known and the unknown. But there is no qualitative difference between the two. That which is known today was unknown yesterday and that which is unknown today may become known tomorrow, it is bound to become known sooner or later.\nGod is neither the known nor the unknown. Then what is god? God is the knower, hence it will always remain beyond science. It is really so stupid that we only think of the object and never think of the subject.\nScience seems to be very illogical about that one thing. The scientist is really very logical about objects but very illogical about himself. He goes on denying himself. He tries to know everything except the scientist himself. He never asks the question, 'Who am I?' He asks all other questions but the most important question is never raised by him. In fact he is afraid to raise it because no scientific method can be of any help in answering it. He will have to move in a totally different world, the world of mysticism.\nGod never happens as an object; it is your very subjectivity. The very energy that knows, is god. Hence the only way to know the knower is to discard all objects. That's what meditation is all about, putting all the objects aside. If the objects are there your knowing is focussed on them; if there is no object your knowing has to come back to yourself. There is no hindrance. A circle is created; it goes away from you but finding no object ultimately comes back to you. In that coming back you experience god. It is energy coming back to its own source.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThat knowing is the only knowing worth calling knowing; all else is superficial. To know it is to know all, not to know it is to know nothing.\n(Hariprem is one of the thousand names that Hindus have found for god, Osho tells Hariprem.) A whole scripture is devoted only to names. In that great scripture, VISHNUSAHASTRANATH, The One Thousand Names of God, nothing else is mentioned; throughout the whole scripture only names are given but each name signifies some aspect of god.\nThe most loved by me is Hari. In no other language of the world, in no other tradition or religion does such a name exist. It is really extraordinary, of some tremendous intuition. Hari means a thief. Now to call god a thief needs courage. Only somebody who knows can do that. And certainly, god is a thief because he steals your heart.\nAnd the surgery is done so silently that you never become aware of what has\nhappened. Suddenly one day you find your heart is missing -- that's the work of Hari, the god! Suddenly one day your own heart is no more your own, it is god's; he has stolen it, he has succeeded!\nLove that thief, invite that thief, pray to that thief, saying 'I am ready,' and leave your door open. Don't create any obstructions, help him in every possible way so that he can steal your heart, because that is the greatest experience that can happen to somebody.\nLife becomes meaningful only when god enters it, before that it is just a drag. The moment god enters you it is a dance.\n(To Cathy from France, Osho gives the name Haridasi.)\nHari is one of the names of god, it means the great thief. And he has already stolen your heart! (much laughter) It is already missing! Later on you can search for it but you will not find it. It happened quickly.\nAnd dasi means one who is surrendered: surrendered to the ultimate thief. So now you are no more your own master, from this very moment become discontinuous with your past, it is no more relevant, it is a new birth. And now live in a surrendered way.\nSurrender means the way of love. And the miracle of love is that through surrender it becomes victorious. And only love becomes victorious, nothing else ever becomes victorious. With god neither money can succeed, nor intellect, nor physical power -- only love, because love is not a fight, it is a surrender. One simply relaxes, one simply lets go of one's ego and one says to god 'I am yours, sincerely yours!'\nAnd the moment you have said that totally -- that 'I am yours', -- a transformation happens instantly. It is not a gradual process, not that one changes slowly slowly. People change slowly because they are cowards.\nThey change slowly because they give up very reluctantly, chunk by chunk. They are very miserly, they go on holding back. If one is ready to give up then immediately, in a single moment, the miracle happens.\nThere is no need to be miserly because our life is god's, it is his gift. We are not giving anything to him, just offering what he has given to us. But people are\nstrange; they cling to something that is not theirs. In that clinging they create misery. Once you accept that your life is not your own, it is god's, and you surrender it unto his feet, all burden disappears, all tension disappears, all anxiety, all anguish. Then life is a sheer joy, a beautiful song, a constant festivity, a celebration. -- How long will you be here? -- Five months. -- Five months won't do. Forever -- and a little bit more! Good, Haridasi.\n(To Judith, the name Premdasi -- devoted to love.)\nThe quality that can make you transported from the mundane to the sacred is love. It is the bridge between the ordinary and the extraordinary, between the manifest and the unmanifest, between the circumference and the centre. One has to learn only one thing, the art of love.\nIt is certain an art. Everybody wants to love and wants to be loved, but nobody learns the art. A great misunderstanding prevails that just by being born you know what love is, so there is no need to learn it.\nCertainly the potential is there, but even the painter with the greatest potential has to learn the art of painting even the greatest dancer has to learn the art of dancing. The potential is there but the art is needed to bring the potential into actuality, to transform it from the seed into a flower.\nSannyas means the art of love. Love in a multi-dimensional way because this whole existence is divine.\nSo don't make choices, love choicelessly. Love for love's sake -- that is the meaning of your name -- and then you need not search for god. God will try to find you -- it is up to him. And only he can find you, you 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\ncannot find him. Where will you try to find him? He has no postal address, no telephone number. In what direction is one going to search for him? -- so searching is futile.\nJust prepare yourself, just be ready to be the host. That's what love does, it creates the host. And the moment the host is ready the guest immediately appears. It has never been otherwise. One can rest assured: whenever you are ready god appears, instantly, immediately.\nI Am Not As Thunk As You Drink I Am Chapter #21\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2869","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/i_am_not_as_thunk_as_you_drink_i_am/part19/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/i_am_not_as_thunk_as_you_drink_i_am/>I Am Not As Thunk As You Drink I Am</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>14 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2869 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/I_Am_Not_As_Thunk_As_You_Drink_I_Am/part19.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part18>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

created you he already judged you. He knows you, you are his creation.
If something goes wrong with you he is responsible, not you. If you go
astray he is responsible, not you. How can you be responsible? -- you
are not your own creation. If you paint and something goes wrong you
cannot say that the painting is the cause of it -- the painter is the
cause.</p><p>So there is no need to be afraid of the crowd or of some imaginary
god at the end of the world asking you what you have done and what you
have not done. He has already judged -- that is really significant -- it
has already happened so you are free. And the moment one knows that one
is totally free to be oneself, life starts having a dynamic quality to
it.</p><p>Fear creates fetters, freedom gives you wings.</p><p>(Bob is a college professor -- and becomes not Swami but Ma Anand
Bob... because Bob's not a man but a lady!)</p><p>Bob has two meanings; one is brightness and the other is fame. Bliss
brings both. As far as you are concerned it gives a tremendous upsurge
to your intelligence, it removes all the hindrances, it sharpens your
genius.</p><p>Everybody is a genius. Society makes people mediocre, stupid, because
society needs the mediocres and the stupids. The mediocres become the
heads and the stupids become the hands. But society is very much afraid
of a real genius -- of a Buddha, of a Lao Tzu, of a Jesus. It is very
much afraid. A genius seems to be a danger to all vested interests --
and in fact he is. The fear is not wrongly- founded, the is right,
because society is dominated by ugly interests, and the man of genius
can see so clearly the whole nonsense that has been perpetuated for
centuries that he immediately rebels. It is not a question of decision
on his part, rebellion comes to him naturally, spontaneously. He cannot
be reduced to a slave, to a commodity.</p><p>Society wants everybody to remain miserable. Miserable people are
good,</p><p>obedient. Miserable people are good because misery destroys their
intelligence. Miserable people are good because they are always

what the society needs, machines, not men. But the people have to suffer
hell for their whole life.</p><p>Bliss opens the doors of paradise. And paradise is not somewhere
above in the clouds, it is within you.</p><p>The moment you start feeling blissful the doors of paradise open. In
fact they are always open, there is not even a Saint Peter on guard --
you just have to be blissful to enter.</p><p>And of course the second meaning is also significant: whenever a
person becomes blissful, without any effort he starts affecting other
people's lives in some mysterious way. It is just like when a flower
opens.</p><p>Somehow the bees come to know that the flower has opened and from
miles they start moving towards it. It has been recorded that from at
least four miles away bees can feel the fragrance and immediately they
start moving in the direction of the fragrance, towards the source of
it.</p><p>So whenever a person becomes blissful it means a flower of
consciousness has opened, and those who you are thirsty -- and who is
not thirsty? -- those who are starved -- and who is not starved? -- they
all start moving as if some magnetic force is pulling them.</p><p>Bliss inside creates intelligence and outside creates a tremendous
attraction for all those who are seeking and searching.</p><p>(You've got to drop knowledge to allow wisdom to surface, Osho
reiterates tonight.) One has to be just like a child. It is a second
childhood. Jesus says again and again 'Unless you are like small
children you will not enter my</p><p>kingdom of god.'</p><p>The rabbis, the pundits, the imams, the ayatollahs, the bishops, the
popes -- they cannot enter the kingdom of god. Those are the people for
whom a special arrangement has been made: hell. It is for V.I.P.'s, it
is a V.I.P. treatment -- or</p><p>V.V.I.P. Hell is not for poor sinners -- who cares about poor
sinners? It is a five- star place. Avoid it!</p><p>My sannyasins have to learn how to renounce knowledge so that they
can become like small children again.</p><p>(A star of love, Osho names the former Genevieve.)</p><p>Love is the only star in the dark night of the soul. But that one
star is enough to transform everything; it can bring the day, the
dawn.</p><p>One has to be totally loving, and the love has not to be something
addressed. It has to be unaddressed like the fragrance of a flower. It
is not a question of giving love to this person or that, it is a
question of just being loving, and ultimately, of being just love.</p><p>These are the three stages: love as a relationship is the lowest,
loving as a quality is higher than the first, and becoming just love --
not even a quality but love itself -- that is the highest. It is because
of this that Jesus says god is love. It is the highest phenomenon, the
ultimate transformation of your energy.</p><p>(Osho speaks of god.)</p><p>God is not an object; it is not something separate from you; it is
not something that one day can become known.</p><p>Science divides reality into only two categories, the known and the
unknown. But there is no qualitative difference between the two. That
which is known today was unknown yesterday and that which is unknown
today may become known tomorrow, it is bound to become known sooner or
later.</p><p>God is neither the known nor the unknown. Then what is god? God is
the knower, hence it will always remain beyond science. It is really so
stupid that we only think of the object and never think of the
subject.</p><p>Science seems to be very illogical about that one thing. The
scientist is really very logical about objects but very illogical about
himself. He goes on denying himself. He tries to know everything except
the scientist himself. He never asks the question, 'Who am I?' He asks
all other questions but the most important question is never raised by
him. In fact he is afraid to raise it because no scientific method can
be of any help in answering it. He will have to move in a totally
different world, the world of mysticism.</p><p>God never happens as an object; it is your very subjectivity. The
very energy that knows, is god. Hence the only way to know the knower is
to discard all objects. That's what meditation is all about, putting all
the objects aside. If the objects are there your knowing is focussed on
them; if there is no object your knowing has to come back to yourself.
There is no hindrance. A circle is created; it goes away from you but
finding no object ultimately comes back to you. In that coming back you
experience god. It is energy coming back to its own source.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>That knowing is the only knowing worth calling knowing; all else is
superficial. To know it is to know all, not to know it is to know
nothing.</p><p>(Hariprem is one of the thousand names that Hindus have found for
god, Osho tells Hariprem.) A whole scripture is devoted only to names.
In that great scripture, VISHNUSAHASTRANATH, The One Thousand Names of
God, nothing else is mentioned; throughout the whole scripture only
names are given but each name signifies some aspect of god.</p><p>The most loved by me is Hari. In no other language of the world, in
no other tradition or religion does such a name exist. It is really
extraordinary, of some tremendous intuition. Hari means a thief. Now to
call god a thief needs courage. Only somebody who knows can do that. And
certainly, god is a thief because he steals your heart.</p><p>And the surgery is done so silently that you never become aware of
what has</p><p>happened. Suddenly one day you find your heart is missing -- that's
the work of Hari, the god! Suddenly one day your own heart is no more
your own, it is god's; he has stolen it, he has succeeded!</p><p>Love that thief, invite that thief, pray to that thief, saying 'I am
ready,' and leave your door open. Don't create any obstructions, help
him in every possible way so that he can steal your heart, because that
is the greatest experience that can happen to somebody.</p><p>Life becomes meaningful only when god enters it, before that it is
just a drag. The moment god enters you it is a dance.</p><p>(To Cathy from France, Osho gives the name Haridasi.)</p><p>Hari is one of the names of god, it means the great thief. And he has
already stolen your heart! (much laughter) It is already missing! Later
on you can search for it but you will not find it. It happened
quickly.</p><p>And dasi means one who is surrendered: surrendered to the ultimate
thief. So now you are no more your own master, from this very moment
become discontinuous with your past, it is no more relevant, it is a new
birth. And now live in a surrendered way.</p><p>Surrender means the way of love. And the miracle of love is that
through surrender it becomes victorious. And only love becomes
victorious, nothing else ever becomes victorious. With god neither money
can succeed, nor intellect, nor physical power -- only love, because
love is not a fight, it is a surrender. One simply relaxes, one simply
lets go of one's ego and one says to god 'I am yours, sincerely
yours!'</p><p>And the moment you have said that totally -- that 'I am yours', -- a
transformation happens instantly. It is not a gradual process, not that
one changes slowly slowly. People change slowly because they are
cowards.</p><p>They change slowly because they give up very reluctantly, chunk by
chunk. They are very miserly, they go on holding back. If one is ready
to give up then immediately, in a single moment, the miracle
happens.</p><p>There is no need to be miserly because our life is god's, it is his
gift. We are not giving anything to him, just offering what he has given
to us. But people are</p><p>strange; they cling to something that is not theirs. In that clinging
they create misery. Once you accept that your life is not your own, it
is god's, and you surrender it unto his feet, all burden disappears, all
tension disappears, all anxiety, all anguish. Then life is a sheer joy,
a beautiful song, a constant festivity, a celebration. -- How long will
you be here? -- Five months. -- Five months won't do. Forever -- and a
little bit more! Good, Haridasi.</p><p>(To Judith, the name Premdasi -- devoted to love.)</p><p>The quality that can make you transported from the mundane to the
sacred is love. It is the bridge between the ordinary and the
extraordinary, between the manifest and the unmanifest, between the
circumference and the centre. One has to learn only one thing, the art
of love.</p><p>It is certain an art. Everybody wants to love and wants to be loved,
but nobody learns the art. A great misunderstanding prevails that just
by being born you know what love is, so there is no need to learn
it.</p><p>Certainly the potential is there, but even the painter with the
greatest potential has to learn the art of painting even the greatest
dancer has to learn the art of dancing. The potential is there but the
art is needed to bring the potential into actuality, to transform it
from the seed into a flower.</p><p>Sannyas means the art of love. Love in a multi-dimensional way
because this whole existence is divine.</p><p>So don't make choices, love choicelessly. Love for love's sake --
that is the meaning of your name -- and then you need not search for
god. God will try to find you -- it is up to him. And only he can find
you, you 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on

address, no telephone number. In what direction is one going to search
for him? -- so searching is futile.</p><p>Just prepare yourself, just be ready to be the host. That's what love
does, it creates the host. And the moment the host is ready the guest
immediately appears. It has never been otherwise. One can rest assured:

It is for reference purposes only.]\n(Osho explains the significance of the name, Swami Dhyan Kurt.) One of the greatest problems that humanity always has to face is the distinction between knowledge and wisdom. Knowledge pretends to be wisdom -- it is not. But it pretends in a very cunning and clever way. It has deceived millions of people. And once a person becomes deceived by his knowledge he loses all track of wisdom, because they are polar opposites.\nThe direction of knowledge is just the opposite of the direction of wisdom. Knowledge is external and wisdom is internal. To seek knowledge one has to go outside oneself and to seek wisdom one has to go in.\nKnowledge is information, wisdom is transformation. Wisdom does not happen through collecting information; it happens through getting rid of the mind itself. Mind is nothing but the accumulation of knowledge, borrowed knowledge. It comes from books, from schools, colleges, universities, from parents, from society, from tradition, church, priests -- from everywhere except from your inner source.\nThe more you become burdened with knowledge the farther away is your inner source of wisdom. My work here consists in helping you to get rid of all this\nburden, to remove all these rocks of knowledge so that the springs of your own wisdom can start flowing. And that's what meditation is all about. Getting rid of the mind is meditation, and the moment you are free of mind wisdom explodes.\nWisdom is light, wisdom is silence, wisdom is divine, wisdom is bliss and wisdom is all that one's heart longs for. It fulfils you totally.\n(Love is wisdom -- that is the meaning of Premgyan, Osho tells the former Patricia.) The sannyasins has to shift his whole energy from the head to the heart. It is not as difficult as it seems in the beginning because the heart is a natural phenomenon and head is a social institution. To go back to nature is never difficult because it is natural. In fact it is more difficult to go to the unnatural. That's why the society needs every child to go through school, college, university -- almost one-third of life is wasted -- to force the energy towards an unnatural centre, the head, and to create barriers so that the energy does not go through the heart.\nThe natural process is that the energy comes from the being to the heart and from the heart to the head.\nThis is the natural process, and if the energy comes through the heart then the heart remains the master and the head becomes the servant. The whole trick of so-called education is to avoid the heart completely and to create a direct track between the being and the head and to ignore the heart.\nIt has been done; the heart is left by the side and the energy starts moving from the being to the head.\nThen the head becomes the master. And the head as a servant is a beautiful serv an t but as a master it is very ugly.\nMy effort here is to undo what society has done to you. But it is not as difficult as society's work is; it does not take twenty-five years. It can happen even in a single moment. It only needs a clear-cut understanding.\nJust the moment you understand what the society has done to you, you can immediately open your heart and the energy starts flowing through it, because that is the natural way, it is how it should be. If the society had not interfered it would have been that way. But the society does not leave anybody uninterfered with.\nThe society is very much afraid of love, very much afraid of the heart, because if a person lives in the head 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nhe is efficient, a good servant, obedient, a slave -- and that's what society needs: slaves, efficient workers, good servants. The society does not need masters.\nOne of the great mystics of the West was Dionysius. He has been very much misunderstood in the West.\nIf he had been is the East he would have been one of the Buddhas. We would have respected him as much as we have respected Buddha, Mahavira, Lao Tzu, not a bit less. But in the West he was laughed at for the simple reason that there was no context in which to understand him. He was a very rare exception; he had no relevance to the society in which he was living. He was a contemporary of Alexander the Great.\nHe lived naked, and once he was caught by a few robbers. Looking at his beautiful body, they thought that it would be good to sell him as a slave, he would fetch good money. In those days all over the world men and women were sold in the marketplace like cattle; they were auctioned. Those robbers were talking together. Dionysius was lying by the side of the river enjoying the sun and he asked 'What are you whispering? What is the matter? What do you want? My feeling is that you are interested in me,' he said to them. They felt a little embarrassed and they confessed, 'Yes, that is true. We are thinking to catch you but we are afraid: although there are eight of us and only one of you, you are so strong that we are afraid that we may not be able to.' He laughed, he said 'Don't be worried. What do you want to catch me for?' They said\n'We want to sell you in the slave market.' He said 'I am coming with you. There is no need to catch me. I am a free man, I am coming out of my own will.'\nThey had never seen such a man! He walked with them like an emperor and they looked like servants!\nAnd he was ordering them 'Do this and do that.' He was a natural master and they were following his orders\n-- what else could you do? He was so strange a man -- they had never come across such a man. They were a little bit puzzled. When they reached the marketplace he stood in the middle of the market and shouted loudly, 'A master has come to be sold -- is any slave ready to purchase me?' That's exactly what he said: 'For the first time a master has come to be sold -- is any slave ready to accept me?'\nOnce your heart is opened even if you are imprisoned you remain a master, even if you are enslaved you remain a master. Your mastery is so deep that nothing can take it away from you. But if the heart is not functioning you may be very rich, you may even be the emperor of a big country, but you are a slave.\nSo you have to do this miracle: shift your energy from the head to the heart. Anand means bliss. Laura means victory; it also means immortality.\nVictory and immortality are two sides of the same coin. The moment you know your immortality you are victorious, never before it. To think that you are the body is to remain in defeat. To think that you are the mind is to remain in the dark night of the soul. And to believe that you are the body and the mind is the root cause of all misery. The moment you become aware that you are something transcendental to body-mind, something more, something plus, immediately great bliss descends on you. The bliss is the beginning of your victory.\nAs you go deeper into this transcendental consciousness, the more you become aware of your eternity, your timelessness. You were here before birth, you will be here after death; death happens only to the body-mind structure, not to you. It is impossible to die.\nConsciousness is immortal. And unless one knows it how can one live joyously? When death is the end of everything, everything becomes pointless. All your creativity is pointless if death is the end of it all, all your love is pointless if death is the end of it all. All your joys are nothing but occupations to somehow keep yourself occupied so that you can avoid the constant knock of death on the door. But for how long can one avoid? Whether you listen to the knock or not one day death opens the door and walks in. It does not even ask 'May I come in, sir?' It simply comes in.\nAnd it does not give you a single moment to prepare. You cannot take anything of whatsoever you have accumulated and for which you wasted your whole life. Death simply dismantles your whole life's effort.\nWith death one cannot feel meaning in life. If everything ends in the grave, what does it matter whether you were a saint or a sinner, whether you were world -- famous or just a nobody, whether you were a president of a country or just a peon in an office -- it does not matter, it is all the same. Death equalises everybody. It comes like a bulldozer and goes on equalising, making everybody flat on the ground.\nBut if there is something more than that in you which defies death then life has meaning. Then what you are doing is significant. Then each act has value because each act is coming out of the immortal source, out of your being. It represents you. And it not only represents you, it also reveals you -- to others and to yourself. It is a manifestation of your being. Then your creativity is your manifestation. Then whatsoever you are doing has significance in the context of eternity.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThen to be a sinner or to be a saint makes a difference, then to be a creator or a destroyer makes a difference. Then the grave is not the end and death is just superficial. In the depths you are deathless, timeless.\nVictory is possible only if you come to know the deathless in you -- and it can be known. That's what sannyas is for. The whole search, the enquiry is for that which abides forever. Only a sannyasin can be victorious.\n(He adds 'Sambuddha' to Flor's name so altogether his sannyas name means enlightenment is man's flowering.)\nMan is a flower and unless he opens up he remains unaware of his own beauty, of the great gift that god has given to him. He remains unaware of the inner\ntreasures which he has been carrying all along. He remains unaware of the kingdom of god within. The moment the blossoming happens and the flower opens up, you are transported into another world. Your life becomes full of light, joy, beauty.\nFlor also means a flower of beauty. Not just a beautiful flower but a flower of beauty itself. And only a Buddha, one who has come to the total realisation of his being, can say 'I have blossomed, flowering has happened to me. I have come to the peak, my potential is actual. Now nothing is left. I have lived my life to the utmost.' And only when you have lived your life to the utmost and your whole potential is transformed into a reality are you worthy of god, never before it.\nSo many people seek and search for god without ever bothering about whether they are ready to meet him, whether they are ready so that he would want to meet them. They never think about that. My emphasis is: forget all about god, just prepare yourself. Whenever the time is ripe and you are ready god is going to happen to you. You need not bother, you need not even think about god; your thinking is not going to help.\nPrepare, and to prepare means to rejoice, to blossom, to dance, to sing, to love, to meditate, so all the dimensions, all the petals of your being, start opening.\nThe eastern symbol of ultimate flowering is a one thousand petalled lotus. The one thousand simply represents it s multi-dimensionality and the fact that those dimensions cannot be counted. They are infinite.\nOnce you start opening the opening goes on and on; you go on opening more and more. And a moment comes when you are just pure fragrance. The flower disappears, only fragrance remains. That is the flower of beauty. The flower is no more there but only an experience, just like a fragrance -- formless.\nIt has happened only to very few people in the world -- unfortunately, because it could have happened to everybody, whosoever has ever lived. It is everybody is right but very few people ever try to make it a reality.\nThis initiation into sannyas should become a new beginning in your life so that you can gather all your energies and pour your whole being into flowering.\n(His name, Dan, is from the name Daniel -- the Old Testament prophet who was\nthrown into a den of lions -- Osho tells the next for sannyas.)\nThe story is that he emerged unharmed. To me it cannot be a historical fact but it is far more important than any historical fact can ever be. It is a parable.\nLions are not so understanding. If man is not then what can you expect from lions? Because he was thrown in by men... And he emerged unharmed. It is not historically possible, unless the lions were not hungry at all, because lions don't kill they are not hungry; it is only man who kills without being hungry.\nI have heard: once a missionary was caught by cannibals in an African jungle. They all are gathered together around him -- the second world war was going on\n-- and they said 'We are puzzled -- you are killing so many people, how do you manage to eat so many people?' He said 'What? Do you think we are cannibals?' They said 'Then it becomes even more puzzling. If you are not eating them, why are you killing them unnecessarily? We are far better: we kill only when we are hungry. For example, today, we have not killed you, we are preserving you because our feast day is to come. We are far more sane; you go on killing millions of people for no reason at all -- and you condemn us poor cannibals. We kill only when we are hungry but you kill without any reason, as if killing itself is an end?'\nA cannibal cannot understand our wars.\nUnless the lion was absolutely fed up with food and he was not interested at all this could not have happened. And I don't think that the people who threw Daniel into the den would have thrown him to lions who were fully fed; he must have been thrown to hungry lions.\nIt is a parable. His body may have been destroyed but he remained untouched by it. He emerged 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nunharmed -- that simply means he remained undisturbed. His silence was not disturbed, his bliss was not disturbed. He remained centred and grounded,\nunshaken, unafraid. That's the true meaning of emerging unharmed. He proved that he knows the truth so he is not worried about the body or the mind, about life. He is not at all worried because he knows some higher life. He has experienced something higher, that's why he is ready to sacrifice his life.\nYou can sacrifice your life only when you know something higher than life, otherwise you cannot sacrifice it And then it is worth sacrificing, rather than sacrificing your truth. Nobody can sacrifice truth if one knows it. One will easily let go of life because any way life is going to end. Where it ends, in your bed or in a den of lions, does not matter; in fact a den of lions is a far better place than just dying in your bed. At least the hungry lions will enjoy it And Daniel must have enjoyed.\nIf I were to write the story I would write it in a different way. He must have enjoyed the fact that at least his body was being used and the poor lions were are enjoying it. He must have participated in their joy, he must have celebrated with them. And he would have remained unconcerned, his coolness unaffected.\nBut that is not the interpretation that Jews and Christians go on putting on Daniel. They think he did a miracle.\nThe Bible has fallen into wrong hands; it needs mystics to interpret it. It is being interpreted by stupid theologians who cannot understand the deeper meaning of things, for whom everything, if it is true, has to be historical. In fact just the reverse is the cases whatsoever is historical is just factual; it has nothing to do with truth. Truth is something higher than history because truth is something higher than time. History is time and truth is not temporal; it is timeless, it is eternal.\nBut it is a beautiful name. Remember that the truth has to be found so that even life becomes insignificant compared to truth. -- How long will you be here? -- Four months. -- That's very good.\nThis is the den of lions (laughter)... and you will not emerge unharmed! (Dan throws back his head and laughs boisterously.)\nGood, Daniel. Good\n(Anand Pratito means the experience of bliss, Osho tells Maria from Belgium.) Bliss is not a concept, an idea. It is an experience, something existential, not just\nintellectual.\nWe have become so accustomed to thinking of everything in terms of the mind that we go on missing the higher realities. Bliss, love, beauty, truth, god -- these are the higher realities, higher than the intellect.\nThe intellect cannot grasp them. If you want to grasp them you have to go higher than intellect.\nNobody can understand love without being in love. Yes, about love you can collect many many things but about love is about love; it is not love itself. About god much information is available, but to know about god is not to know god. Remember that distinction.\nMany are living in deception. They collect information about bliss, about god, about truth, about meditation and they become so hypnotised by their information that they forget that those things have to be experienced. Unless you experience you have not known.\nMy approach here is totally existential. Intellect is being used as a stepping stone, as a ladder, to help you to go beyond it, but it is not the end, only a means.\nThis has to be constantly remembered, otherwise my words can become dangerous to you. If you cling to those words, if you start collecting those words, you will forget the real purpose of being here. The purpose of being here is to experience.\nAvoid the old habit of getting addicted to words and always go on reminding yourself that the purpose of being here is to experience. And then it is possible; it is not as arduous as people think.\nAll great realities can be experienced. Everybody has the potential, the capacity, the opportunity, but if you become addicted to words you lose everything.\n(Truth is the experience of absolute silence -- that's the meaning of Satyam Mauna's name.) All that a sannyasin has to learn is the art of being silent, calm and quiet. And the secret is to be watchful of your mind.\nNothing has to be done with the mind -- no fight, no struggle, no effort to change, just watch it without any prejudice. And just by watching, the mind\nstarts disappearing, evaporating. watching creates enough heat for the mind to evaporate.\nIn the East we have actually called it 'tapa'; tapa means heat. If you witness your mind, great heat, great energy, is created. If you don't watch your mind the energy moves into the mind and becomes thoughts, 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\ndesires, memories, ambitions. The same energy comes as anger, violence, destruction. When you watch, the co-operation is broken, the bridge is broken. Your energy remains with you, it does not move into the mind and you become a reservoir of energy. Great heat is created by it and the mind simply evaporates.\nThe moment there is no mind there is silence, and in that silence truth is experienced. And truth liberates; liberates you from all fear, from all misery, liberates you from all boundaries, limitations, and gives you the freedom of the whole sky. You suddenly become a bird on the wing.\nLove and gratitude -- that is the meaning of Prem Anugraha and the two things that a sannyasin needs.\nHave love for the whole existence and deep gratitude for all that existence has done for you.\nOrdinarily we take everything for granted, as if we have earned it, as if we deserve it. Not only that, we are continuously complaining because we want more and the universe is not giving us enough.\nPeople are continuously grumbling, they are grumpy. Their whole life is full of ungratefulness, they don't have any experience of gratitude. And without these two things -- love and gratitude -- there is no religion at all.\nLove has to be the foundation and gratitude is the temple. Once love and gratitude are there the temple is ready for God to enter. One need not search for God at all, one should only prepare one's being. Love removes all that is wrong,\nall that is negative, and gratitude brings all that is right, all that is positive.\nLove functions as a gardener preparing the ground, removing the rocks and the weeds, and gratitude functions as the gardener sowing the seeds. These two things are enough. Then when the right climate and the right season comes, those seeds start sprouting. And once a seed has sprouted the flowering is not far away, it is very close. The real problem is the beginning of the sprout -- the death of the seed into the soil.\nOnce the seed has died it means the ego has died.\nThe seed is covered with a hard shell and that is our ego. Once the ego is no more there our intrinsic qualities start growing.\nSo you have to do these two things: be loving and be grateful. And then nature takes care of everything else of its own accord.

diary, which has been scanned and cleaned up. It is for reference
purposes only.]</p><p>(Osho explains the significance of the name, Swami Dhyan Kurt.) One
of the greatest problems that humanity always has to face is the
distinction between knowledge and wisdom. Knowledge pretends to be
wisdom -- it is not. But it pretends in a very cunning and clever way.
It has deceived millions of people. And once a person becomes deceived
by his knowledge he loses all track of wisdom, because they are polar
opposites.</p><p>The direction of knowledge is just the opposite of the direction of
wisdom. Knowledge is external and wisdom is internal. To seek knowledge
one has to go outside oneself and to seek wisdom one has to go in.</p><p>Knowledge is information, wisdom is transformation. Wisdom does not
happen through collecting information; it happens through getting rid of
the mind itself. Mind is nothing but the accumulation of knowledge,
borrowed knowledge. It comes from books, from schools, colleges,
universities, from parents, from society, from tradition, church,
priests -- from everywhere except from your inner source.</p><p>The more you become burdened with knowledge the farther away is your
inner source of wisdom. My work here consists in helping you to get rid
of all this</p><p>burden, to remove all these rocks of knowledge so that the springs of
your own wisdom can start flowing. And that's what meditation is all
about. Getting rid of the mind is meditation, and the moment you are
free of mind wisdom explodes.</p><p>Wisdom is light, wisdom is silence, wisdom is divine, wisdom is bliss
and wisdom is all that one's heart longs for. It fulfils you
totally.</p><p>(Love is wisdom -- that is the meaning of Premgyan, Osho tells the
former Patricia.) The sannyasins has to shift his whole energy from the
head to the heart. It is not as difficult as it seems in the beginning
because the heart is a natural phenomenon and head is a social
institution. To go back to nature is never difficult because it is
natural. In fact it is more difficult to go to the unnatural. That's why
the society needs every child to go through school, college, university
-- almost one-third of life is wasted -- to force the energy towards an
unnatural centre, the head, and to create barriers so that the energy
does not go through the heart.</p><p>The natural process is that the energy comes from the being to the
heart and from the heart to the head.</p><p>This is the natural process, and if the energy comes through the
heart then the heart remains the master and the head becomes the
servant. The whole trick of so-called education is to avoid the heart
completely and to create a direct track between the being and the head
and to ignore the heart.</p><p>It has been done; the heart is left by the side and the energy starts
moving from the being to the head.</p><p>Then the head becomes the master. And the head as a servant is a
beautiful serv an t but as a master it is very ugly.</p><p>My effort here is to undo what society has done to you. But it is not
as difficult as society's work is; it does not take twenty-five years.
It can happen even in a single moment. It only needs a clear-cut
understanding.</p><p>Just the moment you understand what the society has done to you, you
can immediately open your heart and the energy starts flowing through
it, because that is the natural way, it is how it should be. If the
society had not interfered it would have been that way. But the society
does not leave anybody uninterfered with.</p><p>The society is very much afraid of love, very much afraid of the
heart, because if a person lives in the head 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished>Osho's books on

society needs: slaves, efficient workers, good servants. The society
does not need masters.</p><p>One of the great mystics of the West was Dionysius. He has been very
much misunderstood in the West.</p><p>If he had been is the East he would have been one of the Buddhas. We
would have respected him as much as we have respected Buddha, Mahavira,
Lao Tzu, not a bit less. But in the West he was laughed at for the
simple reason that there was no context in which to understand him. He
was a very rare exception; he had no relevance to the society in which
he was living. He was a contemporary of Alexander the Great.</p><p>He lived naked, and once he was caught by a few robbers. Looking at
his beautiful body, they thought that it would be good to sell him as a
slave, he would fetch good money. In those days all over the world men
and women were sold in the marketplace like cattle; they were auctioned.
Those robbers were talking together. Dionysius was lying by the side of
the river enjoying the sun and he asked 'What are you whispering? What
is the matter? What do you want? My feeling is that you are interested
in me,' he said to them. They felt a little embarrassed and they
confessed, 'Yes, that is true. We are thinking to catch you but we are
afraid: although there are eight of us and only one of you, you are so
strong that we are afraid that we may not be able to.' He laughed, he
said 'Don't be worried. What do you want to catch me for?' They said</p><p>'We want to sell you in the slave market.' He said 'I am coming with
you. There is no need to catch me. I am a free man, I am coming out of
my own will.'</p><p>They had never seen such a man! He walked with them like an emperor
and they looked like servants!</p><p>And he was ordering them 'Do this and do that.' He was a natural
master and they were following his orders</p><p>-- what else could you do? He was so strange a man -- they had never
come across such a man. They were a little bit puzzled. When they
reached the marketplace he stood in the middle of the market and shouted
loudly, 'A master has come to be sold -- is any slave ready to purchase
me?' That's exactly what he said: 'For the first time a master has come
to be sold -- is any slave ready to accept me?'</p><p>Once your heart is opened even if you are imprisoned you remain a
master, even if you are enslaved you remain a master. Your mastery is so
deep that nothing can take it away from you. But if the heart is not
functioning you may be very rich, you may even be the emperor of a big
country, but you are a slave.</p><p>So you have to do this miracle: shift your energy from the head to
the heart. Anand means bliss. Laura means victory; it also means
immortality.</p><p>Victory and immortality are two sides of the same coin. The moment
you know your immortality you are victorious, never before it. To think
that you are the body is to remain in defeat. To think that you are the
mind is to remain in the dark night of the soul. And to believe that you
are the body and the mind is the root cause of all misery. The moment
you become aware that you are something transcendental to body-mind,
something more, something plus, immediately great bliss descends on you.
The bliss is the beginning of your victory.</p><p>As you go deeper into this transcendental consciousness, the more you
become aware of your eternity, your timelessness. You were here before
birth, you will be here after death; death happens only to the body-mind
structure, not to you. It is impossible to die.</p><p>Consciousness is immortal. And unless one knows it how can one live
joyously? When death is the end of everything, everything becomes
pointless. All your creativity is pointless if death is the end of it
all, all your love is pointless if death is the end of it all. All your
joys are nothing but occupations to somehow keep yourself occupied so
that you can avoid the constant knock of death on the door. But for how
long can one avoid? Whether you listen to the knock or not one day death
opens the door and walks in. It does not even ask 'May I come in, sir?'
It simply comes in.</p><p>And it does not give you a single moment to prepare. You cannot take
anything of whatsoever you have accumulated and for which you wasted
your whole life. Death simply dismantles your whole life's effort.</p><p>With death one cannot feel meaning in life. If everything ends in the
grave, what does it matter whether you were a saint or a sinner, whether
you were world -- famous or just a nobody, whether you were a president
of a country or just a peon in an office -- it does not matter, it is
all the same. Death equalises everybody. It comes like a bulldozer and
goes on equalising, making everybody flat on the ground.</p><p>But if there is something more than that in you which defies death
then life has meaning. Then what you are doing is significant. Then each
act has value because each act is coming out of the immortal source, out
of your being. It represents you. And it not only represents you, it
also reveals you -- to others and to yourself. It is a manifestation of
your being. Then your creativity is your manifestation. Then whatsoever
you are doing has significance in the context of eternity.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>Then to be a sinner or to be a saint makes a difference, then to be a
creator or a destroyer makes a difference. Then the grave is not the end
and death is just superficial. In the depths you are deathless,
timeless.</p><p>Victory is possible only if you come to know the deathless in you --
and it can be known. That's what sannyas is for. The whole search, the
enquiry is for that which abides forever. Only a sannyasin can be
victorious.</p><p>(He adds 'Sambuddha' to Flor's name so altogether his sannyas name
means enlightenment is man's flowering.)</p><p>Man is a flower and unless he opens up he remains unaware of his own
beauty, of the great gift that god has given to him. He remains unaware
of the inner</p><p>treasures which he has been carrying all along. He remains unaware of
the kingdom of god within. The moment the blossoming happens and the
flower opens up, you are transported into another world. Your life
becomes full of light, joy, beauty.</p><p>Flor also means a flower of beauty. Not just a beautiful flower but a
flower of beauty itself. And only a Buddha, one who has come to the
total realisation of his being, can say 'I have blossomed, flowering has
happened to me. I have come to the peak, my potential is actual. Now
nothing is left. I have lived my life to the utmost.' And only when you
have lived your life to the utmost and your whole potential is
transformed into a reality are you worthy of god, never before it.</p><p>So many people seek and search for god without ever bothering about
whether they are ready to meet him, whether they are ready so that he
would <em>want</em> to meet them. They never think about that. My
emphasis is: forget all about god, just prepare yourself. Whenever the
time is ripe and you are ready god is going to happen to you. You need
not bother, you need not even think about god; your thinking is not
going to help.</p><p>Prepare, and to prepare means to rejoice, to blossom, to dance, to
sing, to love, to meditate, so all the dimensions, all the petals of
your being, start opening.</p><p>The eastern symbol of ultimate flowering is a one thousand petalled
lotus. The one thousand simply represents it s multi-dimensionality and
the fact that those dimensions cannot be counted. They are infinite.</p><p>Once you start opening the opening goes on and on; you go on opening
more and more. And a moment comes when you are just pure fragrance. The
flower disappears, only fragrance remains. That is the flower of beauty.
The flower is no more there but only an experience, just like a
fragrance -- formless.</p><p>It has happened only to very few people in the world --
unfortunately, because it could have happened to everybody, whosoever
has ever lived. It is everybody is right but very few people ever try to
make it a reality.</p><p>This initiation into sannyas should become a new beginning in your
life so that you can gather all your energies and pour your whole being
into flowering.</p><p>(His name, Dan, is from the name Daniel -- the Old Testament prophet
who was</p><p>thrown into a den of lions -- Osho tells the next for sannyas.)</p><p>The story is that he emerged unharmed. To me it cannot be a
historical fact but it is far more important than any historical fact
can ever be. It is a parable.</p><p>Lions are not so understanding. If man is not then what can you
expect from lions? Because he was thrown in by men... And he emerged
unharmed. It is not historically possible, unless the lions were not
hungry at all, because lions don't kill they are not hungry; it is only
man who kills without being hungry.</p><p>I have heard: once a missionary was caught by cannibals in an African
jungle. They all are gathered together around him -- the second world
war was going on</p><p>-- and they said 'We are puzzled -- you are killing so many people,
how do you manage to eat so many people?' He said 'What? Do you think we
are cannibals?' They said 'Then it becomes even more puzzling. If you
are not eating them, why are you killing them unnecessarily? We are far
better: we kill only when we are hungry. For example, today, we have not
killed you, we are preserving you because our feast day is to come. We
are far more sane; you go on killing millions of people for no reason at
all -- and you condemn us poor cannibals. We kill only when we are
hungry but you kill without any reason, as if killing itself is an
end?'</p><p>A cannibal cannot understand our wars.</p><p>Unless the lion was absolutely fed up with food and he was not
interested at all this could not have happened. And I don't think that
the people who threw Daniel into the den would have thrown him to lions
who were fully fed; he must have been thrown to hungry lions.</p><p>It is a parable. His body may have been destroyed but he remained
untouched by it. He emerged 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on

was not disturbed, his bliss was not disturbed. He remained centred and
grounded,</p><p>unshaken, unafraid. That's the true meaning of emerging unharmed. He
proved that he knows the truth so he is not worried about the body or
the mind, about life. He is not at all worried because he knows some
higher life. He has experienced something higher, that's why he is ready
to sacrifice his life.</p><p>You can sacrifice your life only when you know something higher than
life, otherwise you cannot sacrifice it And then it is worth
sacrificing, rather than sacrificing your truth. Nobody can sacrifice
truth if one knows it. One will easily let go of life because any way
life is going to end. Where it ends, in your bed or in a den of lions,
does not matter; in fact a den of lions is a far better place than just
dying in your bed. At least the hungry lions will enjoy it And Daniel
must have enjoyed.</p><p>If I were to write the story I would write it in a different way. He
must have enjoyed the fact that at least his body was being used and the
poor lions were are enjoying it. He must have participated in their joy,
he must have celebrated with them. And he would have remained
unconcerned, his coolness unaffected.</p><p>But that is not the interpretation that Jews and Christians go on
putting on Daniel. They think he did a miracle.</p><p>The Bible has fallen into wrong hands; it needs mystics to interpret
it. It is being interpreted by stupid theologians who cannot understand
the deeper meaning <em>of</em> things, for whom everything, <em>if</em>
it is true, has to be historical. In fact just the reverse is the cases
whatsoever is historical is just factual; it has nothing to do with
truth. Truth is something higher than history because truth is something
higher than time. History is time and truth is not temporal; it is
timeless, it <em>is</em> eternal.</p><p>But it is a beautiful name. Remember that the truth has to be found
so that even life becomes insignificant compared to truth. -- How long
will you be here? -- Four months. -- That's very good.</p><p>This is the den of lions (laughter)... and you will not emerge
unharmed! (Dan throws back his head and laughs boisterously.)</p><p>Good, Daniel. Good</p><p>(Anand Pratito means the experience of bliss, Osho tells Maria from
Belgium.) Bliss is not a concept, an idea. It is an experience,
something existential, not just</p><p>intellectual.</p><p>We have become so accustomed to thinking of everything in terms of
the mind that we go on missing the higher realities. Bliss, love,
beauty, truth, god -- these are the higher realities, higher than the
intellect.</p><p>The intellect cannot grasp them. If you want to grasp them you have
to go higher than intellect.</p><p>Nobody can understand love without being in love. Yes, about love you
can collect many many things but about love is about love; it is not
love itself. About god much information is available, but to know about
god is not to know god. Remember that distinction.</p><p>Many are living in deception. They collect information about bliss,
about god, about truth, about meditation and they become so hypnotised
by their information that they forget that those things have to be
experienced. Unless you experience you have not known.</p><p>My approach here is totally existential. Intellect is being used as a
stepping stone, as a ladder, to help you to go beyond it, but it is not
the end, only a means.</p><p>This has to be constantly remembered, otherwise my words can become
dangerous to you. If you cling to those words, if you start collecting
those words, you will forget the real purpose of being here. The purpose
of being here is to experience.</p><p>Avoid the old habit of getting addicted to words and always go on
reminding yourself that the purpose of being here is to experience. And
then it is possible; it is not as arduous as people think.</p><p>All great realities can be experienced. Everybody has the potential,
the capacity, the opportunity, but if you become addicted to words you
lose everything.</p><p>(Truth is the experience of absolute silence -- that's the meaning of
Satyam Mauna's name.) All that a sannyasin has to learn is the art of
being silent, calm and quiet. And the secret is to be watchful of your
mind.</p><p>Nothing has to be done with the mind -- no fight, no struggle, no
effort to change, just watch it without any prejudice. And just by
watching, the mind</p><p>starts disappearing, evaporating. watching creates enough heat for
the mind to evaporate.</p><p>In the East we have actually called it 'tapa'; tapa means heat. If
you witness your mind, great heat, great energy, is created. If you
don't watch your mind the energy moves into the mind and becomes
thoughts, 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on

violence, destruction. When you watch, the co-operation is broken, the
bridge is broken. Your energy remains with you, it does not move into
the mind and you become a reservoir of energy. Great heat is created by
it and the mind simply evaporates.</p><p>The moment there is no mind there is silence, and in that silence
truth is experienced. And truth liberates; liberates you from all fear,
from all misery, liberates you from all boundaries, limitations, and
gives you the freedom of the whole sky. You suddenly become a bird on
the wing.</p><p>Love and gratitude -- that is the meaning of Prem Anugraha and the
two things that a sannyasin needs.</p><p>Have love for the whole existence and deep gratitude for all that
existence has done for you.</p><p>Ordinarily we take everything for granted, as if we have earned it,
as if we deserve it. Not only that, we are continuously complaining
because we want more and the universe is not giving us enough.</p><p>People are continuously grumbling, they are grumpy. Their whole life
is full of ungratefulness, they don't have any experience of gratitude.
And without these two things -- love and gratitude -- there is no
religion at all.</p><p>Love has to be the foundation and gratitude is the temple. Once love
and gratitude are there the temple is ready for God to enter. One need
not search for God at all, one should only prepare one's being. Love
removes all that is wrong,</p><p>all that is negative, and gratitude brings all that is right, all
that is positive.</p><p>Love functions as a gardener preparing the ground, removing the rocks
and the weeds, and gratitude functions as the gardener sowing the seeds.
These two things are enough. Then when the right climate and the right
season comes, those seeds start sprouting. And once a seed has sprouted
the flowering is not far away, it is very close. The real problem is the
beginning of the sprout -- the death of the seed into the soil.</p><p>Once the seed has died it means the ego has died.</p><p>The seed is covered with a hard shell and that is our ego. Once the
ego is no more there our intrinsic qualities start growing.</p><p>So you have to do these two things: be loving and be grateful. And
then nature takes care of everything else of its own accord. You need
not worry, you can trust the whole.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:justify id=i-am-not-as-thunk-as-you-drink-i-am>I Am Not As Thunk As You Drink

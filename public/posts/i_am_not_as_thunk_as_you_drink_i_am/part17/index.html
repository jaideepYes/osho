It is for reference purposes only.]\n(A man to be really worthy of the name man has to go through not one but two births, Osho says to Rita from Switzerland. Then he explains why.)\nOne is the physical birth, the other is the spiritual birth. The physical happens to everybody but for the spiritual one has to work, one has to deserve it. The first is ordinary, it only gives you the material dimension, and because there is no spiritual dimension in it, it is utterly dark. Matter is darkness, spirit is light. Unless one is born again one remains in a dark night. The initiation into sannyas means the preparation for the second birth.\nSocrates says the master functions as a midwife, and he is absolutely right. The function of the master is to bring your potential into the actual, to help you to\ncome out of darkness into the light. And the moment you are born into light bliss also starts happening of its own accord.\nMisery belongs to the first birth and bliss belongs to the second. So those who have not attained the second birth can hope for bliss but they will never attain it.\nRemember, by becoming a sannyasin you are entering into great work upon yourself. But miracles are possible if we work and everybody is entitled to miracles.\nJesus has not got more potential than you have got, neither has Buddha nor Lao Tzu. As far as spiritual possibility is concerned everybody is absolutely alike, we just have to prepare the ground, uproot the weeds, remove the rocks, so that roses can grow in it.\n(Osho makes of Amrit Gerhard the meaning; the search for immortality needs great effort.) In fact it is good that it is a great struggle because in that very challenge one grows. If it were easily available like any other commodity life would lose all depth, all height, life would become a mundane phenomenon. The things of the world are available easily but higher values have to be attained after an arduous climbing towards the heights. One needs to be a great warrior. But the fight is not with anybody else, the fight is inner, it is with the hindrances within yourself, with the rocks that are preventing your flow of energy, with the blocks. They don't allow you to function in a total, wholistic way.\nAccept the challenge. At the innermost core of every human being there is a ray of light which immediately joins you together with the immortal world, with the eternal, which takes you beyond time and beyond death. But we have to go in search of it and there are many hazards, hindrances, many possibilities of going astray. like a jigsaw puzzle, One has to be very intelligent, alert, aware at each point because the possibilities of going wrong are many, and the possibility to be right is only one amongst the many.\nBut if one is alert and watchful and one is learning even from mistakes then the task, howsoever difficult it is, is not impossible. And the joy of reaching to that ultimate peak is infinite. Compared to that joy all that we do for it is nothing.\n(His understanding of the real meaning of a Christian is one who is a Christ, Osho tells Dhyan Tina.) Friedrich Nietzsche is right when he says that the first and the last Christian died on the cross twenty centuries ago. His insistence is\nworth meditating on: the first and last Christian. So the whole world of the Christians is just pseudo, it is hypocrisy more or less. It is the same with Hindus and the same with the Buddhists and the same with the Mohammedans, there are three hundred religions on the earth and it is true about all those three hundred religions.\nTo be a Christ only one quality is needed and that is meditation. To be a Christ means to be so silent that 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nthe whole turmoil of the mind disappears and the silence is so profound that one can hear the still, small voice of god within one's own being. It arises from your very depths. You are just a listener, you are just on the receiving end.\nThat's how all the great scriptures are born. The Upanishadas, the Koran, the beatitudes of Jesus, the Sermon on the Mount, the Bhagavad Gita, the Dhammapada, Lao Tzu's Tao Te Ching -- these great documents are not written by somebody, they have been heard. The people who were writing were not writing on their own, they were just vehicles, they were writing on behalf of god. But that is possible only when your mind has completely gone, otherwise it will interfere. So the whole art of being a Christ or a Buddha is to be absolutely silent.\nSo learn to be silent, enjoy silence and whenever you have an opportunity to be silent just fall into it.\nMake it a point that the most important thing in life is silence. Everything else is secondary. So everything can be sacrificed for it but it cannot be sacrificed for anything.\nThis is the foundational commitment of sannyas, that from now onwards meditation will be your religion -- and meditation is the essential core of all religions.\n(Joost becomes Prem Satyo -- which Osho explains as meaning love is the\nbeginning of the experience of truth.)\nTo love is to open a window unto the vast sky of truth. And remember that the frame of the window is not the sky and the frame of the window is not the frame of the sky either, the sky is far bigger. The frame has nothing to do with the sky.\nLove is only a frame. It belongs to your heart just as the window belongs to your house. But when you open the window you can see the stars, faraway stars, millions of light years away. You can see the clouds, you can see the moon, the sun. Suddenly a great perspective becomes available to you. But one has to remember constantly that this is only a beginning. Love is the beginning, not the end.\nOnce you have felt the sky through the window then you have to go beyond even the window. And these are the three centres of man. The first is the head. Head means a house with all the windows and doors closed. The second centre is the heart -- the same house but the windows and the doors are open. You can experience something of the beyond. Although you are still in the same house it is no longer a prison, there are openings. If you decide to go out you can. And there is great pull from the outside world because now the wind, the rain and the sun reach you, and they are all indications of the beyond -- the birds sing and the flowers open and their fragrance flows to you. Everything is calling you out of your small cage.\nThe house is our body. The head belongs to that same body but it is closed. The heart also belongs to that body but it has openings, hence it is far better to live through the heart than through the head. Both belong to the body, but from the head there is no going beyond because there is no opening. You are not even aware there is something beyond. With the heart the beyond starts communing with you.\nAnd then comes the third centre, your being. That means you have hoard the call of the beyond and you have gone out of the house, you have surpassed the house. You are no more inside the house, you are under the sky, under the stars. But to reach the third the second is a most essential preparation.\nSo love is the beginning; love means the heart. Logic is not the beginning; logic means the head. Logic is invulnerable. It is like a Leibnitzian monad -- windowless, completely enclosed. The heart is vulnerable, it allows the beyond\nto come to you. And that is the beginning. Something starts stirring in you, something of the beyond starts ringing bells in you. A challenge has come. It is irresistible, you have to go.\nAnd the moment you leave the house, you surpass the house -- that means the moment you start forgetting the body-mind structure and look beyond -- you have entered into the world of truth, the ultimate truth. And it is truth that liberates, it is truth that brings bliss, it is truth that brings freedom. And these are our deepest longings, only truth can fulfil them. Without the experience of truth man remains unfulfilled, a tree without flowers, a barren tree.\nA sannyasin has to become full of flowers and fruits. The very flavour of a sannyasin has to be that of tremendous contentment, fulfilment.\n(Anand Shivam means bliss is virtue, Osho tells the former Michael from Trinidad.) Misery is sin, misery is immoral, misery is vice because the miserable person goes on knowingly or unknowingly creating misery for others. He cannot help it; he can give only that which he has got. Even if he does not want it he is a victim of his own misery. Even if he wants to do some good the ultimate result is going to be bad. In spite of all his good intention, his actions will bring misery to people because nothing 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\ncan arise out of a miserable person that can bring bliss to people. That's the very definition of good, virtue: helping people to be blissful. But you can give only that which you have got, hence to me bliss is virtue, the only virtue.\nBe blissful -- that's what I teach. I don't teach you to be virtuous because that is secondary, that is a by-product. I teach the real transformation within you. Move from misery to bliss and then whatsoever you do will be good; it cannot be anything else than good.\nSo I don't teach any service to the public. People think my sannyasins are selfish\n-- they are not. But my understanding is that unless a person transforms his energy from misery to bliss... and that is an inner work, it has nothing to do with\nthe public or with serving the people, the poor, the ill. You have to go through a transformation within yourself and then, once the transformation has happened, it is inevitable that you will do something which will beautify the world, which will make the world a little better, which will help mankind to rise a little higher.\nI am not concerned about that because it is inevitable, there is no need to talk about it. That's why I never talk about altruism. What is the need? If you grow roses fragrance is bound to come. I teach only how to grow roses. Why waste time with the fragrance? And if people become too interested in fragrance they will forget about growing roses. That's what has happened..\nPeople like Mother Theresa of Calcutta or Vinoba Bhave -- and there are many around the world like these people who have wasted their whole life in serving others... But if you look at them you can sees what service can they do? They don't seem to be in a state of celebration. Mother Theresa is as dry and dead as Morarji Desai. Sometimes I wonder why they don't get married! (much laughter) They would make the most absurd couple in the world -- they look so alike! The world has missed a great opportunity.\nAltruism comes on its own, and I certainly teach you to be selfish, selfish in the true sense of the word.\nKnow thyself -- that is selfishness; be thyself -- that is selfishness; and then act out of it -- that too is selfishness. But if one has fulfilled these conditions, of being oneself, of knowing oneself, of acting according to one's own light, then life becomes a great sharing, a great rejoicing. And one does not become egoistic about doing something good to people, one simply enjoys sharing one's own light. It is out of sheer joy, for joy's sake. One is not obliging anybody.\nThat is Shivam; it is a by-product of bliss.\n(The Greek mystic, Heraclitus, says you can't step in the same river twice. Osho goes one further.) I would like to say you cannot step in the same river even once, because the river is moving so fast.\nLife is a river, a constant movement. In this moving wheel one cannot find anything except love which can give a glimpse of the eternal, of the non- changing, of the immutable. Love seems to be the only rainbow bridge between time and eternity. There has to be some bridge because life in all its dimensions is an organic unity. Nothing is separate, nothing can be separate; it is all oneness.\nSo there is bound to be some subtle link between time and eternity.\nAnd my experience is that the rainbow bridge is love. I call it a rainbow bridge for three reasons. One: it is very fragile, very delicate? you can destroy it very easily. Secondly I call it a rainbow bridge because it has all the colours, all the dimensions, of both worlds, of this and that, of this shore and the further shore.\nBecause it joins both it has all the colours of both; it is multi-coloured and multi- dimensional. It is very rich.\nThirdly, I call it a rainbow bridge because you cannot possess it. If you try to possess a rainbow you will not find anything, your hands will be empty -- maybe a little bit wet, that's all. It is there in all its tremendous beauty but don't try to possess it. Enjoy it, dance it, sing it but don't try to possess it.\nAnd these three things have to be remembered about love too. Don't try to possess it otherwise it will disappear. People destroy their love in the effort to possess it. The paradox of love is, if you want to possess it you will destroy it, you will miss it; if you don't want to and always yours. It belongs to the non- possessive person.\nLove has all dimensions but I want to make it one-dimensional because we are afraid of multi-dimensionality. That too is a way of destroying it. You want the rainbow to be only of one colour -- it is not possible. You may have chosen the most beautiful colour but you cannot paint a rainbow just green or just red or just yellow. You cannot paint it, it has to be multi-dimensional. We kill love in trying to colour it.\nFor example, a man can love a woman for one reason and he can love another woman for another reason and still another for another reason. But lovers don't accept that. A woman can love one man for his intelligence and she can love another man for his physical beauty -- because the intelligent person may not always be beautiful. A few very ugly people have been known to be very intelligent. Socrates is one of the 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nexamples; he was one of the ugliest men... disgusting! (much laughter)... but one of the most intelligent who has ever walked on earth. One would love him for his intelligence, but for his body... one would have to keep one's eyes closed! (laughter)\nAnd women know the secret: whenever they make love to a man they keep their eyes closed. Because many men are like Socrates, it is better not to see what they are doing! (laughter) It is better not to see their faces because they may be going through contortions and all kinds of things! If you see it you may freak out! That's why women make love in darkness. It is always good: under the blanket (in the deluge of laughter one can lip-read where Osho's words are drowned, 'in the darkness, with closed eyes...').\nSo let this Socrates do whatsoever he wants to and meanwhile you can think of some beautiful person.\nIn a bed you will always find at least four persons: the two real ones and the two that both lovers are fantasising about.\nOne can love one person for one reason, another person for another reason, but up to now we have not accepted it, and that has been one of the greatest causes of love not being able to transform the earth, of love dying so quickly.\nWe kill it. Our demands are so much. We cannot accept the simple phenomenon that the woman may love a man for his music or for his poetry or for his painting, for his body, for his intelligence, for his silence, for his coolness -- there are thousands of qualities, nobody can claim all of them. No woman can claim all the qualities either. It is very rare to find an intellectual woman -- intelligent, but not intellectual.\nAt least I have not found one yet and I must have known more women than any man in the world! (laughter) And I trust thorn only because they don't have much intellectuality. They function intuitively, that is the feminine form of intelligence. I have handed over the whole commune to women because one thing is certain, they cannot be cunning, they cannot be deceptive, they cannot betray me -- it is impossible.\nWhatsoever they do they will do out of love. But the clever can become cunning at any moment. And sometimes you may find a woman who is an intellectual and you may love her for that. She shows one aspect of beauty.\nAnother woman may be physically beautiful and psychologically very nasty. That is almost always the case. People fall in love with the physical and once they are trapped then slowly they come to know about the psychology of the woman -- and she is just crazy, but now it is too late.\nIf we understand love as a rainbow of all the colours, then a totally different quality can exist on earth.\nThen one can love many people, it becomes friendship. And one can love people for different reasons.\nThere is no reason to be possessive.\nAnd thirdly, I call it a rainbow bridge because the rainbow is the only phenomenon in nature which joins the earth with the sky. It is an are joining the physical with the metaphysical, joining the material with the spiritual. Love joins two extremes which almost seem to be unjoinable, which cannot have any meeting ground -- but love makes that impossible possible.\nSo go deeply into love, non-possessively. Don't try to hold on to it, allow its multi-dimensionality.\nTransform it more and more into a friendship so that no jealousy exists. And remember, it is fragile. It can be destroyed very easily. It is very difficult to create it and it is very easy to destroy it.\nIt is like a rose flower. This fundamental law of nature has never to be forgotten, that whenever the higher is in conflict with the lower, the lower will win. If you clash a rock with a rose flower you cannot hope for the rose flower to destroy the rock; the rock will destroy the rose flower. The higher is vulnerable, very fragile. Handle it with care. The lower in a brutal way, an animal way, is always stronger. And love is crushed by the lower realities -- anger, hatred, jealousy. They are like rocks and love is like a rose flower.\nOr it would be even more true to say that love is like the fragrance that arises out of the rose flower. But it can lead you to immortality, to the world beyond change, beyond death.\n(Simon, the son of elderly ashramite, Paritosh, after several visits to the ashram over a period of two or three years, takes sannyas tonight..Osho names him Prem\nDinesh.) A life without love is a life of darkness -- and of unending darkness -- no dawn ever comes, no sun ever rises. Millions of people live in this dark night of the soul from the cradle to the grave. In fact they have remained unborn. They were in darkness in the womb of the mother; even out of the womb they are not in the light Physically of course they are in the light but spiritually they are still unborn. The miracle of the day has not happened yet, the sun has not risen, the eastern horizon has not yet become red. It can become red only when you start throbbing with love, when you start pulsating with love.\nLove means a heart-to-heart contact with existence. It may be person-to-person, it may be from a person 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\ntowards nature, it may be between a person and music, poetry, painting. It can be personal, it can be impersonal, it can be universal. One can love the whole existence in its totality, as it is, with all the stars.\nThe greater your love is, the greater you become. The smaller your love is, the smaller you remain. Your love is the criterion of how big you are. So love without any other consideration because love means growth. Love more and more people -- birds, animals, trees, rocks -- include as much as you can in your love. One day it has to become all-inclusive so that nothing is left outside it, everything has fallen in and has become a part of it.\nWhen love encompasses all it becomes divine, it becomes the experience of god. And that's what I mean by the beginning of the day: suddenly the sun has risen and that rising sun takes you into realms undreamt of. Otherwise man remains crawling on the earth just like a snake; he knows nothing of anything other than the dust in which he crawls. He is not aware of the stars, not aware of the vast beyond, not aware of the infinity that surrounds him, not aware of the eternity of which he is a part, an essential part.\nWe are not islands; we are part of an infinite existence. We have always been here and we will always be here. We have been in different forms, in different forms we will be. Birth and death are episodes in an eternity of life.

diary, which has been scanned and cleaned up. It is for reference
purposes only.]</p><p>(A man to be really worthy of the name man has to go through not one
but two births, Osho says to Rita from Switzerland. Then he explains
why.)</p><p>One is the physical birth, the other is the spiritual birth. The
physical happens to everybody but for the spiritual one has to work, one
has to deserve it. The first is ordinary, it only gives you the material
dimension, and because there is no spiritual dimension in it, it is
utterly dark. Matter is darkness, spirit is light. Unless one is born
again one remains in a dark night. The initiation into sannyas means the
preparation for the second birth.</p><p>Socrates says the master functions as a midwife, and he is absolutely
right. The function of the master is to bring your potential into the
actual, to help you to</p><p>come out of darkness into the light. And the moment you are born into
light bliss also starts happening of its own accord.</p><p>Misery belongs to the first birth and bliss belongs to the second. So
those who have not attained the second birth can hope for bliss but they
will never attain it.</p><p>Remember, by becoming a sannyasin you are entering into great work
upon yourself. But miracles are possible if we work and everybody is
entitled to miracles.</p><p>Jesus has not got more potential than you have got, neither has
Buddha nor Lao Tzu. As far as spiritual possibility is concerned
everybody is absolutely alike, we just have to prepare the ground,
uproot the weeds, remove the rocks, so that roses can grow in it.</p><p>(Osho makes of Amrit Gerhard the meaning; the search for immortality
needs great effort.) In fact it is good that it is a great struggle
because in that very challenge one grows. If it were easily available
like any other commodity life would lose all depth, all height, life
would become a mundane phenomenon. The things of the world are available
easily but higher values have to be attained after an arduous climbing
towards the heights. One needs to be a great warrior. But the fight is
not with anybody else, the fight is inner, it is with the hindrances
within yourself, with the rocks that are preventing your flow of energy,
with the blocks. They don't allow you to function in a total, wholistic
way.</p><p>Accept the challenge. At the innermost core of every human being
there is a ray of light which immediately joins you together with the
immortal world, with the eternal, which takes you beyond time and beyond
death. But we have to go in search of it and there are many hazards,
hindrances, many possibilities of going astray. like a jigsaw puzzle,
One has to be very intelligent, alert, aware at each point because the
possibilities of going wrong are many, and the possibility to be right
is only one amongst the many.</p><p>But if one is alert and watchful and one is learning even from
mistakes then the task, howsoever difficult it is, is not impossible.
And the joy of reaching to that ultimate peak is infinite. Compared to
that joy all that we do for it is nothing.</p><p>(His understanding of the real meaning of a Christian is one who is a
Christ, Osho tells Dhyan Tina.) Friedrich Nietzsche is right when he
says that the first and the last Christian died on the cross twenty
centuries ago. His insistence is</p><p>worth meditating on: the first and last Christian. So the whole world
of the Christians is just pseudo, it is hypocrisy more or less. It is
the same with Hindus and the same with the Buddhists and the same with
the Mohammedans, there are three hundred religions on the earth and it
is true about all those three hundred religions.</p><p>To be a Christ only one quality is needed and that is meditation. To
be a Christ means to be so silent that 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>the whole turmoil of the mind disappears and the silence is so
profound that one can hear the still, small voice of god within one's
own being. It arises from your very depths. You are just a listener, you
are just on the receiving end.</p><p>That's how all the great scriptures are born. The Upanishadas, the
Koran, the beatitudes of Jesus, the Sermon on the Mount, the Bhagavad
Gita, the Dhammapada, Lao Tzu's Tao Te Ching -- these great documents
are not written by somebody, they have been heard. The people who were
writing were not writing on their own, they were just vehicles, they
were writing on behalf of god. But that is possible only when your mind
has completely gone, otherwise it will interfere. So the whole art of
being a Christ or a Buddha is to be absolutely silent.</p><p>So learn to be silent, enjoy silence and whenever you have an
opportunity to be silent just fall into it.</p><p>Make it a point that the most important thing in life is silence.
Everything else is secondary. So everything can be sacrificed for it but
it cannot be sacrificed for anything.</p><p>This is the foundational commitment of sannyas, that from now onwards
meditation will be your religion -- and meditation is the essential core
of all religions.</p><p>(Joost becomes Prem Satyo -- which Osho explains as meaning love is
the</p><p>beginning of the experience of truth.)</p><p>To love is to open a window unto the vast sky of truth. And remember
that the frame of the window is not the sky and the frame of the window
is not the frame of the sky either, the sky is far bigger. The frame has
nothing to do with the sky.</p><p>Love is only a frame. It belongs to your heart just as the window
belongs to your house. But when you open the window you can see the
stars, faraway stars, millions of light years away. You can see the
clouds, you can see the moon, the sun. Suddenly a great perspective
becomes available to you. But one has to remember constantly that this
is only a beginning. Love is the beginning, not the end.</p><p>Once you have felt the sky through the window then you have to go
beyond even the window. And these are the three centres of man. The
first is the head. Head means a house with all the windows and doors
closed. The second centre is the heart -- the same house but the windows
and the doors are open. You can experience something of the beyond.
Although you are still in the same house it is no longer a prison, there
are openings. If you decide to go out you can. And there is great pull
from the outside world because now the wind, the rain and the sun reach
you, and they are all indications of the beyond -- the birds sing and
the flowers open and their fragrance flows to you. Everything is calling
you out of your small cage.</p><p>The house is our body. The head belongs to that same body but it is
closed. The heart also belongs to that body but it has openings, hence
it is far better to live through the heart than through the head. Both
belong to the body, but from the head there is no going beyond because
there is no opening. You are not even aware there is something beyond.
With the heart the beyond starts communing with you.</p><p>And then comes the third centre, your being. That means you have
hoard the call of the beyond and you have gone out of the house, you
have surpassed the house. You are no more inside the house, you are
under the sky, under the stars. But to reach the third the second is a
most essential preparation.</p><p>So love is the beginning; love means the heart. Logic is not the
beginning; logic means the head. Logic is invulnerable. It is like a
Leibnitzian monad -- windowless, completely enclosed. The heart is
vulnerable, it allows the beyond</p><p>to come to you. And that is the beginning. Something starts stirring
in you, something of the beyond starts ringing bells in you. A challenge
has come. It is irresistible, you have to go.</p><p>And the moment you leave the house, you surpass the house -- that
means the moment you start forgetting the body-mind structure and look
beyond -- you have entered into the world of truth, the ultimate truth.
And it is truth that liberates, it is truth that brings bliss, it is
truth that brings freedom. And these are our deepest longings, only
truth can fulfil them. Without the experience of truth man remains
unfulfilled, a tree without flowers, a barren tree.</p><p>A sannyasin has to become full of flowers and fruits. The very
flavour of a sannyasin has to be that of tremendous contentment,
fulfilment.</p><p>(Anand Shivam means bliss is virtue, Osho tells the former Michael
from Trinidad.) Misery is sin, misery is immoral, misery is vice because
the miserable person goes on knowingly or unknowingly creating misery
for others. He cannot help it; he can give only that which he has got.
Even if he does not want it he is a victim of his own misery. Even if he
wants to do some good the ultimate result is going to be bad. In spite
of all his good intention, his actions will bring misery to people
because nothing 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on

That's the very definition of good, virtue: helping people to be
blissful. But you can give only that which you have got, hence to me
bliss is virtue, the only virtue.</p><p>Be blissful -- that's what I teach. I don't teach you to be virtuous
because that is secondary, that is a by-product. I teach the real
transformation within you. Move from misery to bliss and then whatsoever
you do will be good; it cannot be anything else than good.</p><p>So I don't teach any service to the public. People think my
sannyasins are selfish</p><p>-- they are not. But my understanding is that unless a person
transforms his energy from misery to bliss... and that is an inner work,
it has nothing to do with</p><p>the public or with serving the people, the poor, the ill. You have to
go through a transformation within yourself and then, once the
transformation has happened, it is inevitable that you will do something
which will beautify the world, which will make the world a little
better, which will help mankind to rise a little higher.</p><p>I am not concerned about that because it is inevitable, there is no
need to talk about it. That's why I never talk about altruism. What is
the need? If you grow roses fragrance is bound to come. I teach only how
to grow roses. Why waste time with the fragrance? And if people become
too interested in fragrance they will forget about growing roses. That's
what has happened..</p><p>People like Mother Theresa of Calcutta or Vinoba Bhave -- and there
are many around the world like these people who have wasted their whole
life in serving others... But if you look at them you can sees what
service can they do? They don't seem to be in a state of celebration.
Mother Theresa is as dry and dead as Morarji Desai. Sometimes I wonder
why they don't get married! (much laughter) They would make the most
absurd couple in the world -- they look so alike! The world has missed a
great opportunity.</p><p>Altruism comes on its own, and I certainly teach you to be selfish,
selfish in the true sense of the word.</p><p>Know thyself -- that is selfishness; be thyself -- that is
selfishness; and then act out of it -- that too is selfishness. But if
one has fulfilled these conditions, of being oneself, of knowing
oneself, of acting according to one's own light, then life becomes a
great sharing, a great rejoicing. And one does not become egoistic about
doing something good to people, one simply enjoys sharing one's own
light. It is out of sheer joy, for joy's sake. One is not obliging
anybody.</p><p>That is Shivam; it is a by-product of bliss.</p><p>(The Greek mystic, Heraclitus, says you can't step in the same river
twice. Osho goes one further.) I would like to say you cannot step in
the same river even once, because the river is moving so fast.</p><p>Life is a river, a constant movement. In this moving wheel one cannot
find anything except love which can give a glimpse of the eternal, of
the non- changing, of the immutable. Love seems to be the only rainbow
bridge between time and eternity. There has to be some bridge because
life in all its dimensions is an organic unity. Nothing is separate,
nothing can be separate; it is all oneness.</p><p>So there is bound to be some subtle link between time and
eternity.</p><p>And my experience is that the rainbow bridge is love. I call it a
rainbow bridge for three reasons. One: it is very fragile, very
delicate? you can destroy it very easily. Secondly I call it a rainbow
bridge because it has all the colours, all the dimensions, of both
worlds, of this and that, of this shore and the further shore.</p><p>Because it joins both it has all the colours of both; it is
multi-coloured and multi- dimensional. It is very rich.</p><p>Thirdly, I call it a rainbow bridge because you cannot possess it. If
you try to possess a rainbow you will not find anything, your hands will
be empty -- maybe a little bit wet, that's all. It is there in all its
tremendous beauty but don't try to possess it. Enjoy it, dance it, sing
it but don't try to possess it.</p><p>And these three things have to be remembered about love too. Don't
try to possess it otherwise it will disappear. People destroy their love
in the effort to possess it. The paradox of love is, if you want to
possess it you will destroy it, you will miss it; if you don't want to
and always yours. It belongs to the non- possessive person.</p><p>Love has all dimensions but I want to make it one-dimensional because
we are afraid of multi-dimensionality. That too is a way of destroying
it. You want the rainbow to be only of one colour -- it is not possible.
You may have chosen the most beautiful colour but you cannot paint a
rainbow just green or just red or just yellow. You cannot paint it, it
<em>has</em> to be multi-dimensional. We kill love in trying to colour
it.</p><p>For example, a man can love a woman for one reason and he can love
another woman for another reason and still another for another reason.
But lovers don't accept that. A woman can love one man for his
intelligence and she can love another man for his physical beauty --
because the intelligent person may not always be beautiful. A few very
ugly people have been known to be very intelligent. Socrates is one of
the 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>examples; he was one of the ugliest men... disgusting! (much
laughter)... but one of the most intelligent who has ever walked on
earth. One would love him for his intelligence, but for his body... one
would have to keep one's eyes closed! (laughter)</p><p>And women know the secret: whenever they make love to a man they keep
their eyes closed. Because many men are like Socrates, it is better not
to see what they are doing! (laughter) It is better not to see their
faces because they may be going through contortions and all kinds of
things! If you see it you may freak out! That's why women make love in
darkness. It is always good: under the blanket (in the deluge of
laughter one can lip-read where Osho's words are drowned, 'in the
darkness, with closed eyes...').</p><p>So let this Socrates do whatsoever he wants to and meanwhile you can
think of some beautiful person.</p><p>In a bed you will always find at least four persons: the two real
ones and the two that both lovers are fantasising about.</p><p>One can love one person for one reason, another person for another
reason, but up to now we have not accepted it, and that has been one of
the greatest causes of love not being able to transform the earth, of
love dying so quickly.</p><p>We kill it. Our demands are so much. We cannot accept the simple
phenomenon that the woman may love a man for his music or for his poetry
or for his painting, for his body, for his intelligence, for his
silence, for his coolness -- there are thousands of qualities, nobody
can claim all of them. No woman can claim all the qualities either. It
is very rare to find an intellectual woman -- intelligent, but not
intellectual.</p><p>At least I have not found one yet and I must have known more women
than any man in the world! (laughter) And I trust thorn only because
they don't have much intellectuality. They function intuitively, that is
the feminine form of intelligence. I have handed over the whole commune
to women because one thing is certain, they cannot be cunning, they
cannot be deceptive, they cannot betray me -- it is impossible.</p><p>Whatsoever they do they will do out of love. But the clever can
become cunning at any moment. And sometimes you may find a woman who is
an intellectual and you may love her for that. She shows one aspect of
beauty.</p><p>Another woman may be physically beautiful and psychologically very
nasty. That is almost always the case. People fall in love with the
physical and once they are trapped then slowly they come to know about
the psychology of the woman -- and she is just crazy, but now it is too
late.</p><p>If we understand love as a rainbow of all the colours, then a totally
different quality can exist on earth.</p><p>Then one can love many people, it becomes friendship. And one can
love people for different reasons.</p><p>There is no reason to be possessive.</p><p>And thirdly, I call it a rainbow bridge because the rainbow is the
only phenomenon in nature which joins the earth with the sky. It is an
are joining the physical with the metaphysical, joining the material
with the spiritual. Love joins two extremes which almost seem to be
unjoinable, which cannot have any meeting ground -- but love makes that
impossible possible.</p><p>So go deeply into love, non-possessively. Don't try to hold on to it,
allow its multi-dimensionality.</p><p>Transform it more and more into a friendship so that no jealousy
exists. And remember, it is fragile. It can be destroyed very easily. It
is very difficult to create it and it is very easy to destroy it.</p><p>It is like a rose flower. This fundamental law of nature has never to
be forgotten, that whenever the higher is in conflict with the lower,
the lower will win. If you clash a rock with a rose flower you cannot
hope for the rose flower to destroy the rock; the rock will destroy the
rose flower. The higher is vulnerable, very fragile. Handle it with
care. The lower in a brutal way, an animal way, is always stronger. And
love is crushed by the lower realities -- anger, hatred, jealousy. They
are like rocks and love is like a rose flower.</p><p>Or it would be even more true to say that love is like the fragrance
that arises out of the rose flower. But it can lead you to immortality,
to the world beyond change, beyond death.</p><p>(Simon, the son of elderly ashramite, Paritosh, after several visits
to the ashram over a period of two or three years, takes sannyas
tonight..Osho names him Prem</p><p>Dinesh.) A life without love is a life of darkness -- and of unending
darkness -- no dawn ever comes, no sun ever rises. Millions of people
live in this dark night of the soul from the cradle to the grave. In
fact they have remained unborn. They were in darkness in the womb of the
mother; even out of the womb they are not in the light Physically of
course they are in the light but spiritually they are still unborn. The
miracle of the day has not happened yet, the sun has not risen, the
eastern horizon has not yet become red. It can become red only when you
start throbbing with love, when you start pulsating with love.</p><p>Love means a heart-to-heart contact with existence. It may be
person-to-person, it may be from a person 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-4>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>towards nature, it may be between a person and music, poetry,
painting. It can be personal, it can be impersonal, it can be universal.
One can love the whole existence in its totality, as it is, with all the
stars.</p><p>The greater your love is, the greater you become. The smaller your
love is, the smaller you remain. Your love is the criterion of how big
you are. So love without any other consideration because love means
growth. Love more and more people -- birds, animals, trees, rocks --
include as much as you can in your love. One day it has to become
all-inclusive so that nothing is left outside it, everything has fallen
in and has become a part of it.</p><p>When love encompasses all it becomes divine, it becomes the
experience of god. And that's what I mean by the beginning of the day:
suddenly the sun has risen and that rising sun takes you into realms
undreamt of. Otherwise man remains crawling on the earth just like a
snake; he knows nothing of anything other than the dust in which he
crawls. He is not aware of the stars, not aware of the vast beyond, not
aware of the infinity that surrounds him, not aware of the eternity of
which he is a part, an essential part.</p><p>We are not islands; we are part of an infinite existence. We have
always been here and we will always be here. We have been in different
forms, in different forms we will be. Birth and death are episodes in an
eternity of life. Only when</p><p>this is experienced is darkness dispelled an d the day has
arrived.</p><p>It is because of this that for my sannyas I have chosen the colour of
the eastern horizon in the early morning just before the sun rises. This
is the colour -- the orange of the eastern horizon at that tremendously
significant moment when night changes into day, when death changes into
abundant life. It is the colour of that transition, that transmutation,
that radical change, that revolution.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:justify id=i-am-not-as-thunk-as-you-drink-i-am>I Am Not As Thunk As You Drink

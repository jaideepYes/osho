The treasure is there but hidden in our being and unless we become aware of it, it is almost as if it does not exist. We can be emperors but we remain beggars for the simple reason that we don't know what seeds we have brought from the beyond.\nMeditation is just a method of discovering one's potential. Once it is known you cannot remain indifferent to it; the whole world pales down compared to it. Then all the flowers of the outside are nothing and all the beauty and all the sunrises and sunsets are nothing. The inner beauty is immeasurable, because what we see outside is only the painting and inside what we see is the painter himself. Outside we see the dance, inside we see the dancer himself. Outside is the world, inside is god himself.\n(You can only worship god when you've experienced something that makes you grateful to god, Osho points out.)\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nIf there is no bliss in your being your whole life will be a complaint; you will be really irritated and annoyed. You will be asking again and again 'Why have I been created? Why was I not asked before I was created?'\nOne of the characters of Dostoevsky's very famous novel, THE BROTHERS KARAMAZOV, says 'If I ever meet god I will be unable to contain my anger. I could even kill him! Why did he create me? And without asking me, what right has he got?' And one cannot say that what this character is saying is absolutely wrong.\nOrdinary life is such a tragedy that it is very natural to feel enraged.\nFriedrich Nietzsche has written a small parable. A madman comes to the city and declares 'God is dead\n-- have you heard it or not?' The crowd starts laughing and they start asking stupid questions. It is absolutely certain to them that the m an is mad. What nonsense is he talking about?\nThey have heard of two types of people, one who believes in god, one who doesn't. This fool seems to be a new type; he says god is dead. Before Friedrich Nietzsche's madman, nobody had said that god is dead.\nThey are giggling and laughing and making fun and finally he says 'I think you have not yet heard the news, I have come ahead of my time. And moreover I have to say to you that he did not die naturally, it is you who have killed him.'\nNow it is absolutely certain that he has gone completely crazy.…\nBut he is right: man has killed god, for the simple reason that his life is so joyless -- how can he tolerate somebody who gave him this life? You cannot forgive god; worshipping is far away, even forgiving is not possible.\nHence my whole approach is not that of teaching you a certain belief but\ncreating a right climate inside you. Bliss is the right climate.\nLove, sing, dance, enjoy as much as you can, everything that is possible to enjoy has to be enjoyed, and only then when you are rising higher and higher in your cheerfulness does a sense of gratitude arise. At a certain point you start feeling the grace of god, the blessing of being here. Then there is gratitude -- and that gratitude becomes worship.\nIt may not become a ritualistic worship like the Hindus and the Christians and the Mohammedans have\n-- there is no need for it to become a ritual. The real worshipper is in a certain state of gratitude towards the whole because it has given you so much and you don't deserve it at all and there is no way to repay it. So all that we c an do is bow down to existence. That is worship.\n(Henry is given one of the Indian names for god -- Narayana.) In India we have one thousand names for god, for the simple reason that god is multi-dimensional and that multi-dimensionality cannot be expressed through one name; the name will not cover his wholeness.\nEven one thousand names are not enough to cover all his aspects but they cover a few important aspects.\nNarayana is a very beautiful name. 'Nar' means man and Narayana means one who lives in man, one who has made man his abode. It is one of the aspects of god, that he is the interiormost core of everything that exists; he abides in everything. At the very centre of the rose flower you will find him, he is there at the very centre of a rock. He is the centre of everything -- that is the meaning of Narayana. And particularly in reference to man it means that there is no qualitative difference between man and god. That is one of the greatest contributions of eastern mystics to the world.\nAll the religions that evolved outside India missed this dimension. Judaism, Christianity, Islam -- these are the three religions born outside of India. All these throe religions make a qualitative difference between man and god. They all insist that man cannot be god; god is god and man is man. At the most man can be religious, holy, but never god.\nThere are also three religions that were born in India -- Hinduism, Jainism,\nBuddhism. These are the six great religions of the world. All three religions that have come out of the Indian mystic experience are agreed on one point: that there is no qualitative difference between man and god; man is only god asleep and god is only man awake. That's the only difference. So if one becomes awake one is god.\nAnd my effort here is just that: to help you to be awake, to be aware, to dispel the darkness and to bring light into you. And suddenly, the truth, that 'I am that -- Aham Brahasmi -- I am god' is revealed. It is not an ego assertion, it is the realisation of the ultimate truth.\n(Mahesh, Norbert's new name, is also a name of god.)\nJust as there is the idea of the Christian trinity -- god the father, god the son and god the holy ghost -- in 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nIndia we also have the idea of a trinity. We call it the trimurti, the three faces of god -- and they are far more significant than the Christian idea.\nCompared to the eastern idea the Christian idea looks very childish, immature. These are the three faces of god -- not three people, remember. The Christian idea is of three people. The eastern idea is only of three faces; the person is one but he has three faces, three basic aspects.\nThese are the three names of the eastern trinity. The first is Brahma; Brahma means the creative force, god's creativity. The second is Vishnu; Vishnu means god's power to maintain existence. Brahma creates; Vishnu maintains, keeps it in tune, keeps it in harmony, in accord, And the third is Mahesh; Mahesh means the destructive power of god... because everything that is born has to die, everything that begins has to end.\nNo other religion has that idea; they are afraid of accepting that god can destroy. But you cannot create if you cannot destroy. Creativity and destruction are two aspects of the same coin. In fact whenever you create you are already destroying\nsomething, and when you are destroying you are creating something.\nFor example, when a painter paints on the canvas he is creating a painting but destroying the canvas.\nWhen the physician operates on you he is destroying the disease and creating health. Destruction and creation go hand in hand, they are two wings.\nMahesh means the destructive part of god. Brahma begins, Mahesh ends, and between the two Vishnu maintains. Each existence begins with Brahma and ends with Mahesh. And to me destruction is a prerequisite for creation. If you don't abolish the old you will not be able to create the new. So it is a circle; you cannot really say who comes first. You cannot say Brahma comes first, because before Brahma Mahesh has to destroy, and before Mahesh Vishnu has to maintain and before Vishnu Brahma has to create and before Brahma Mahesh has to destroy -- it is a circle. And it is tremendously significant to understand that life is a circular process.\nEverything in existence moves in circles: the earth, the sun, the stars, all move in circles. You cannot pinpoint where it begins and where it ends; all is one process. That's why they say there is one god with three faces. You can look from one side and you can see one face but the other two faces are still there, whether you look at them or not.\nAnd my work begins with destruction. Every creation has to begin with destruction. I have to destroy all the conventions in your mind, all the traditions in your mind, all the ideas in your mind; I have to destroy all that has been imposed upon you. Only through that destruction will you be created, will you come out in your reality, in your purity. That will be the beginning. But before the beginning there is a death. Every birth has to be preceded by death.\nThe word 'mahesh' itself means the great god. Brahma does not mean the great god, he is only one of the gods; Vishnu is another. But Mahesh means the great god because destruction is the greatest work; without it nothing is possible. Destruction means revolution. And each moment we have to die to the past. we have to destroy the past, we have to get rid of it so each moment becomes a new moment, a fresh beginning.\nHence it is significant that the god of destruction, not the god of creation, is called the great god.\nOrdinarily one would think, logically one would think that the god who creates would be called the great god but he is not called the great god. And you will be surprised that in the whole of India only one temple exists for Brahma, only one\n-- and there are millions of temples in India, in fact each city has hundreds of temples. Even a small village has at least half a dozen temples. People may not have places to live in but there are temples.\nBrahma has only one temple devoted to him, Vishnu has many temples devoted to him but Mahesh has millions of temples devoted to him. In fact so many temples were devoted to Mahesh that they had to drop the idea of making a temple. So any place where you put a shivalinga... the shivalinga is the symbol of Mahesh. Find just any round stone you can and put it under a tree. You can just sit by the side and within a few minutes you will see that somebody has brought flowers and somebody has started chanting mantras --\nand the temple has started!\nIn fact when for the first time the Britishers made roads and they made milestones they were in trouble because wherever they put a milestone people would start worshipping it! It made great trouble prevent them doing it, telling them that this was just a milestone. It took years to prevent them. The police had to see that nobody worshipped the milestone... because it becomes a temple immediately. You put the stone there... And the milestones were painted red -- that made them even more important. They were the colour of sannyas, so they must be devoted to some god. And India has the idea that all included there are three hundred and thirty million gods, so who knows which god he is? -- but at least, whosoever he is, it is better not to annoy him: put a few flowers there, chant a few son's and worship him.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nMahesh has the greatest number of temples. It shows one thing, that the East understood very correctly the beauty of destruction. To worship the god of destruction is to accept the fundamental of revolution .\n(The light your eyes perceive is not real illumination, Osho tells us.) It only reveals objects. It only reveals the superficial, it does not reveal the innermost core of things; the subjectivity remains unrevealed by it. The definition of true light is that which reveals your interiority -- and it is possible only through meditation. There is no other way to reveal your inner world, to make it full of light, to see what it is. And once you have seen your inner world you have seen everybody else's inner world too, because it is the same reality.\nIf you have seen one rose flower you have seen all rose flowers. Then the difference will be only of detail. Some flower's be a little smaller, and some will be a little bigger, some will be yellow and some will be red, but the flowering is the same. And to understand one flower is enough; to understand all flowering.\nSo the person who knows himself knows everything and the person who goes on accumulating knowledge about everything without bothering about himself becomes loaded with knowledge and remains just a donkey loaded with scriptures. He knows nothing, he has not yet found the true light.\nSo here you have to work deeply on meditative techniques. My whole emphasis is on meditation. It is the key, it opens the door to the divine.\n(Nirav means silence.)\nBecome as silent as possible, drop all noise of the mind.\nMind is very noisy, it is a marketplace, so withdraw from it. Take shelter in your heart. And when you take shelter in the heart and the mind is left far away you will start feeling silence descending on you. This is half the journey, from mind to the heart -- the first stoppage in the journey. When this is complete and you can see the mind moving farther and farther away and can see the silence descending upon you, then take shelter in being. It is even deeper than the heart. The heart is very silent compared to the mind but it has its own very subtle noise. It is beautiful, like bees humming, it is very musical. So when you come from the mind to the heart you feel great silence, comparatively -- because it is a relative experience.\nBut when you move from the heart to the being then you realise that even the heart had its own noise.\nTaking shelter in the heart you feel silence descending, but taking shelter in the\nbeing the whole experience changes. Suddenly you see you are silence, not that silence is descending, it is no more a separate thing.\nAnd that is the meaning of your name, silence.\nThe head is absolutely noisy, the heart is very musical -- the noise has a certain melody about it and it is very subtle -- and the being is just silence. And in these two steps the journey is complete.\nThe whole journey from man to god consists only of two steps. The first is from the head to the heart and the second is from the heart to the being.\n(A basic ingredient for growth -- and a rare one these days -- is the quality of patience, Osho says.) The world has become too time-conscious. Everybody is in a hurry, nobody can rest, nobody can sit silently. Everybody is fidgeting, they are restless, hankering to do something, because we have been brought up with the idea that time is money, don't waste it -- do something! But sannyas is initiation into non-doing.\nFind as much time as you can for non-doing, for just sitting, just relaxing, resting, waiting, not exactly knowing for what -- because whatsoever the mind can expect will not be god, will not be truth, will not be enlightenment; it will be just a thought. And the mind knows nothing about these transcendental things.\nSo one has to learn a deep waiting without any expectation about what is going to happen. Just waiting in silence, in stillness, miracles start happening. One has just to be patient with god and he comes, he surely comes. You need not go anywhere to find him; he comes looking for you, searching for you.\nSo this is going to be your work: be patient, awaiting, and find as much time as possible when you can drop the hurry and the worry and time-consciousness. Doing nothing is always far better than doing something because the essential will be found by non-doing. By doing you will find money, power, prestige which are non-essentials. By doing you will find the world, you will become worldly-rich; by non-doing you will find the eternal, the infinite. You will become rich in a totally different sense. It is a richness which cannot be destroyed, a richness which even death cannot take away -- and that is the only true richness.\n(Marco's new name, Abhinavo, is to remind him that sannyas is the art of\nrenewing oneself every moment. It is a constant rebirthing.) 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nDie each moment to the past, don't let it hang around you, so each moment you are fresh and young.\nThe past clings like dust and the past goes on growing bigger every day, so layers and layers of dust accumulate on the mirror of consciousness -- and that's the only problem. Because the mirror becomes so covered it cannot reflect anything. It loses its mirrorlike quality totally, it becomes blind.\nOne has to go on removing the dust. When the mirror is absolutely fresh every moment you are continuously in contact with god. God simply means that which is, so if you are capable of reflecting that which is you are living in god.\n(Niraj means a cloud, and the cloud is representative of freedom, Osho explains.) It is untethered to anything, the whole sky is available to it, it can move in any direction. It is so free that in fact it has no destination at all, it is not going towards some address; it is simply enjoying floating in the sun, on the winds. It is so totally free that it is always ready to go with the wind wherever it is going.\nOut of that freedom comes a second quality -- that of let-go. So it is always in a state of let-go. The wind goes to the south, it goes to the south. If the wind starts moving towards the north it does not say 'What is the matter? -- we were going to the south. How can you change just in the middle of the journey?' No, it simply starts moving towards the north. There is no problem, no resistance.\nFreedom brings let-go, and because there is absolute let-go there is no possibility of the ego. Ego needs resistance, fight, struggle, the ego wants things according to its conditions. The cloud has no conditions, it is unconditionally one with existence.\nAnd that's what a sannyasin has to be -- a cloud, living in deep let-go, freedom,\negolessness, living in such immense trust with existence that everything is good. Life is good and death too.\nWhen both are equally good one has come home. When there is nothing to choose all anxiety disappears. When there is nothing to choose there is nothing to lose either; whatsoever happens now is totally accepted as a gift. And the gifts are always coming to the person who is ready to receive. To live like a cloud is the true way of living.\nAnand Samadhan.\nIt is not the solution to any particular problem, it is a solution for all problems. Those who try to solve single problems are never going to succeed because there are millions of problems. You can go on solving; there will be no end to it. New problems are arising every day: you can solve a few but meanwhile many more will have arisen.\nOne can go crazy in trying to solve problems individually. It is like cutting the leaves of a tree. The tree is huge and you go on cutting the leaves and new leaves go on coming up. Instead of one, three leaves will pop up; you cut one and the tree will respond with three leaves. It will become thicker, the foliage will be thicker because the tree takes on the challenge; you cannot defeat it so easily. But cut the roots and the whole tree is gone, all the leaves will fall on their own. But roots are invisible and leaves are visible; hence many people go on pruning the leaves for the whole of their life.\nThe case is exactly the same with man: the root of all problems is the mind, but the mind is invisible.\nThe body is visible so people go on doing things with the body. They will stand on their heads and they will think they are doing something -- yoga -- that they are becoming spiritual by standing on their head. They are only looking silly, that's all. You can go on distorting your body this way and that -- that is not going to help.\nA young man came to a Zen master. The Zen master asked, \"Have you ever been to another master before?\" and the young man said, \"Yes, I have been to a certain master.\"\nThe Zen master asked, \"What have you learned there?\"\nThe young man said, \"I will show you.\" He sat in the Buddha posture and closed his eyes. The master hit him hard on the head with his staff and said, \"You fool! Get lost! Get out of here! We already have so many stone buddhas in our temple\n-- what are we going to do with you?\"\nJust sitting like a buddha is not going to help. It is easy to learn because the body is visible but inside the mind is going crazy -- and you are sitting like a buddha. You can fast, you can learn exercises, you can chant mantras, because these things are visible -- but the real thing is to become a witness of your mind.\nMind is not visible; it has no weight. Thoughts are not things; they are weightless. That's why you can contain millions of thoughts. If they had weight it would be impossible to contain so many thoughts in the head; the head is so small.\nAs many weightless thoughts as you like can be contained. In fact they say that a single man's mind is 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\ncapable of containing all the libraries of the world.

out in you, Osho tells us to begin this evening.)</p><p>We are born with great potential but we are not born aware of it. The
treasure is there but hidden in our being and unless we become aware of
it, it is almost as if it does not exist. We can be emperors but we
remain beggars for the simple reason that we don't know what seeds we
have brought from the beyond.</p><p>Meditation is just a method of discovering one's potential. Once it
is known you cannot remain indifferent to it; the whole world pales down
compared to it. Then all the flowers of the outside are nothing and all
the beauty and all the sunrises and sunsets are nothing. The inner
beauty is immeasurable, because what we see outside is only the painting
and inside what we see is the painter himself. Outside we see the dance,
inside we see the dancer himself. Outside is the world, inside is god
himself.</p><p>(You can only worship god when you've experienced something that
makes you grateful to god, Osho points out.)</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished>Osho's books on

complaint; you will be really irritated and annoyed. You will be asking
again and again 'Why have I been created? Why was I not asked before I
was created?'</p><p>One of the characters of Dostoevsky's very famous novel, THE BROTHERS
KARAMAZOV, says 'If I ever meet god I will be unable to contain my
anger. I could even kill him! Why did he create me? And without asking
me, what right has he got?' And one cannot say that what this character
is saying is absolutely wrong.</p><p>Ordinary life is such a tragedy that it is very natural to feel
enraged.</p><p>Friedrich Nietzsche has written a small parable. A madman comes to
the city and declares 'God is dead</p><p>-- have you heard it or not?' The crowd starts laughing and they
start asking stupid questions. It is absolutely certain to them that the
m an is mad. What nonsense is he talking about?</p><p>They have heard of two types of people, one who believes in god, one
who doesn't. This fool seems to be a new type; he says god is dead.
Before Friedrich Nietzsche's madman, nobody had said that god is
dead.</p><p>They are giggling and laughing and making fun and finally he says 'I
think you have not yet heard the news, I have come ahead of my time. And
moreover I have to say to you that he did not die naturally, it is
<em>you</em> who have killed him.'</p><p>Now it is absolutely certain that he has gone completely crazy.…</p><p>But he is right: man has killed god, for the simple reason that his
life is so joyless -- how can he tolerate somebody who gave him this
life? You cannot forgive god; worshipping is far away, even forgiving is
not possible.</p><p>Hence my whole approach is not that of teaching you a certain belief
but</p><p>creating a right climate inside you. Bliss is the right climate.</p><p>Love, sing, dance, enjoy as much as you can, everything that is
possible to enjoy has to be enjoyed, and only then when you are rising
higher and higher in your cheerfulness does a sense of gratitude arise.
At a certain point you start feeling the grace of god, the blessing of
being here. Then there is gratitude -- and that gratitude becomes
worship.</p><p>It may not become a ritualistic worship like the Hindus and the
Christians and the Mohammedans have</p><p>-- there is no need for it to become a ritual. The real worshipper is
in a certain state of gratitude towards the whole because it has given
you so much and you don't deserve it at all and there is no way to repay
it. So all that we c an do is bow down to existence. That is
worship.</p><p>(Henry is given one of the Indian names for god -- Narayana.) In
India we have one thousand names for god, for the simple reason that god
is multi-dimensional and that multi-dimensionality cannot be expressed
through one name; the name will not cover his wholeness.</p><p>Even one thousand names are not enough to cover all his aspects but
they cover a few important aspects.</p><p>Narayana is a very beautiful name. 'Nar' means man and Narayana means
one who lives in man, one who has made man his abode. It is one of the
aspects of god, that he is the interiormost core of everything that
exists; he abides in everything. At the very centre of the rose flower
you will find him, he is there at the very centre of a rock. He is the
centre of everything -- that is the meaning of Narayana. And
particularly in reference to man it means that there is no qualitative
difference between man and god. That is one of the greatest
contributions of eastern mystics to the world.</p><p>All the religions that evolved outside India missed this dimension.
Judaism, Christianity, Islam -- these are the three religions born
outside of India. All these throe religions make a qualitative
difference between man and god. They all insist that man cannot be god;
god is god and man is man. At the most man can be religious, holy, but
never god.</p><p>There are also three religions that were born in India -- Hinduism,
Jainism,</p><p>Buddhism. These are the six great religions of the world. All three
religions that have come out of the Indian mystic experience are agreed
on one point: that there is no qualitative difference between man and
god; man is only god asleep and god is only man awake. That's the only
difference. So if one becomes awake one is god.</p><p>And my effort here is just that: to help you to be awake, to be
aware, to dispel the darkness and to bring light into you. And suddenly,
the truth, that 'I am that -- Aham Brahasmi -- I am god' is revealed. It
is not an ego assertion, it is the realisation of the ultimate
truth.</p><p>(Mahesh, Norbert's new name, is also a name of god.)</p><p>Just as there is the idea of the Christian trinity -- god the father,
god the son and god the holy ghost -- in 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>India we also have the idea of a trinity. We call it the trimurti,
the three faces of god -- and they are far more significant than the
Christian idea.</p><p>Compared to the eastern idea the Christian idea looks very childish,
immature. These are the three faces of god -- not three people,
remember. The Christian idea is of three people. The eastern idea is
only of three faces; the person is one but he has three faces, three
basic aspects.</p><p>These are the three names of the eastern trinity. The first is
Brahma; Brahma means the creative force, god's creativity. The second is
Vishnu; Vishnu means god's power to maintain existence. Brahma creates;
Vishnu maintains, keeps it in tune, keeps it in harmony, in accord, And
the third is Mahesh; Mahesh means the destructive power of god...
because everything that is born has to die, everything that begins has
to end.</p><p>No other religion has that idea; they are afraid of accepting that
god can destroy. But you cannot create if you cannot destroy. Creativity
and destruction are two aspects of the same coin. In fact whenever you
create you are already destroying</p><p>something, and when you are destroying you are creating
something.</p><p>For example, when a painter paints on the canvas he is creating a
painting but destroying the canvas.</p><p>When the physician operates on you he is destroying the disease and
creating health. Destruction and creation go hand in hand, they are two
wings.</p><p>Mahesh means the destructive part of god. Brahma begins, Mahesh ends,
and between the two Vishnu maintains. Each existence begins with Brahma
and ends with Mahesh. And to me destruction is a prerequisite for
creation. If you don't abolish the old you will not be able to create
the new. So it is a circle; you cannot really say who comes first. You
cannot say Brahma comes first, because before Brahma Mahesh has to
destroy, and before Mahesh Vishnu has to maintain and before Vishnu
Brahma has to create and before Brahma Mahesh has to destroy -- it is a
circle. And it is tremendously significant to understand that life is a
circular process.</p><p>Everything in existence moves in circles: the earth, the sun, the
stars, all move in circles. You cannot pinpoint where it begins and
where it ends; all is one process. That's why they say there is one god
with three faces. You can look from one side and you can see one face
but the other two faces are still there, whether you look at them or
not.</p><p>And my work begins with destruction. Every creation has to begin with
destruction. I have to destroy all the conventions in your mind, all the
traditions in your mind, all the ideas in your mind; I have to destroy
all that has been imposed upon you. Only through that destruction will
you be created, will you come out in your reality, in your purity. That
will be the beginning. But before the beginning there is a death. Every
birth has to be preceded by death.</p><p>The word 'mahesh' itself means the great god. Brahma does not mean
the great god, he is only one of the gods; Vishnu is another. But Mahesh
means the great god because destruction is the greatest work; without it
nothing is possible. Destruction means revolution. And each moment we
have to die to the past. we have to destroy the past, we have to get rid
of it so each moment becomes a new moment, a fresh beginning.</p><p>Hence it is significant that the god of destruction, not the god of
creation, is called the great god.</p><p>Ordinarily one would think, logically one would think that the god
who creates would be called the great god but he is not called the great
god. And you will be surprised that in the whole of India only one
temple exists for Brahma, only one</p><p>-- and there are millions of temples in India, in fact each city has
hundreds of temples. Even a small village has at least half a dozen
temples. People may not have places to live in but there are
temples.</p><p>Brahma has only one temple devoted to him, Vishnu has many temples
devoted to him but Mahesh has <em>millions</em> of temples devoted to
him. In fact so many temples were devoted to Mahesh that they had to
drop the idea of making a temple. So any place where you put a
shivalinga... the shivalinga is the symbol of Mahesh. Find just any
round stone you can and put it under a tree. You can just sit by the
side and within a few minutes you will see that somebody has brought
flowers and somebody has started chanting mantras --</p><p>and the temple has started!</p><p>In fact when for the first time the Britishers made roads and they
made milestones they were in trouble because wherever they put a
milestone people would start worshipping it! It made great trouble
prevent them doing it, telling them that this was just a milestone. It
took years to prevent them. The police had to see that nobody worshipped
the milestone... because it becomes a temple immediately. You put the
stone there... And the milestones were painted red -- that made them
even more important. They were the colour of sannyas, so they must be
devoted to some god. And India has the idea that all included there are
three hundred and thirty million gods, so who knows which god he is? --
but at least, whosoever he is, it is better not to annoy him: put a few
flowers there, chant a few son's and worship him.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>Mahesh has the greatest number of temples. It shows one thing, that
the East understood very correctly the beauty of destruction. To worship
the god of destruction is to accept the fundamental of revolution .</p><p>(The light your eyes perceive is not real illumination, Osho tells
us.) It only reveals objects. It only reveals the superficial, it does
not reveal the innermost core of things; the subjectivity remains
unrevealed by it. The definition of true light is that which reveals
your interiority -- and it is possible only through meditation. There is
no other way to reveal your inner world, to make it full of light, to
see what it is. And once you have seen your inner world you have seen
everybody else's inner world too, because it is the same reality.</p><p>If you have seen one rose flower you have seen all rose flowers. Then
the difference will be only of detail. Some flower's be a little
smaller, and some will be a little bigger, some will be yellow and some
will be red, but the flowering is the same. And to understand one flower
is enough; to understand all flowering.</p><p>So the person who knows himself knows everything and the person who
goes on accumulating knowledge about everything without bothering about
himself becomes loaded with knowledge and remains just a donkey loaded
with scriptures. He knows nothing, he has not yet found the true
light.</p><p>So here you have to work deeply on meditative techniques. My whole
emphasis is on meditation. It is the key, it opens the door to the
divine.</p><p>(Nirav means silence.)</p><p>Become as silent as possible, drop all noise of the mind.</p><p>Mind is very noisy, it is a marketplace, so withdraw from it. Take
shelter in your heart. And when you take shelter in the heart and the
mind is left far away you will start feeling silence descending on you.
This is half the journey, from mind to the heart -- the first stoppage
in the journey. When this is complete and you can see the mind moving
farther and farther away and can see the silence descending upon you,
then take shelter in being. It is even deeper than the heart. The heart
is very silent compared to the mind but it has its own very subtle
noise. It is beautiful, like bees humming, it is very musical. So when
you come from the mind to the heart you feel great silence,
comparatively -- because it is a relative experience.</p><p>But when you move from the heart to the being then you realise that
even the heart had its own noise.</p><p>Taking shelter in the heart you feel silence descending, but taking
shelter in the</p><p>being the whole experience changes. Suddenly you see you <em>are</em>
silence, not that silence is descending, it is no more a separate
thing.</p><p>And that is the meaning of your name, silence.</p><p>The head is absolutely noisy, the heart is very musical -- the noise
has a certain melody about it and it is very subtle -- and the being is
just silence. And in these two steps the journey is complete.</p><p>The whole journey from man to god consists only of two steps. The
first is from the head to the heart and the second is from the heart to
the being.</p><p>(A basic ingredient for growth -- and a rare one these days -- is the
quality of patience, Osho says.) The world has become too
time-conscious. Everybody is in a hurry, nobody can rest, nobody can sit
silently. Everybody is fidgeting, they are restless, hankering to do
something, because we have been brought up with the idea that time is
money, don't waste it -- do something! But sannyas is initiation into
non-doing.</p><p>Find as much time as you can for non-doing, for just sitting, just
relaxing, resting, waiting, not exactly knowing for what -- because
whatsoever the mind can expect will not be god, will not be truth, will
not be enlightenment; it will be just a thought. And the mind knows
nothing about these transcendental things.</p><p>So one has to learn a deep waiting without any expectation about what
is going to happen. Just waiting in silence, in stillness, miracles
start happening. One has just to be patient with god and he comes, he
surely comes. You need not go anywhere to find him; he comes looking for
you, searching for you.</p><p>So this is going to be your work: be patient, awaiting, and find as
much time as possible when you can drop the hurry and the worry and
time-consciousness. Doing nothing is always far better than doing
something because the essential will be found by non-doing. By doing you
will find money, power, prestige which are non-essentials. By doing you
will find the world, you will become worldly-rich; by non-doing you will
find the eternal, the infinite. You will become rich in a totally
different sense. It is a richness which cannot be destroyed, a richness
which even death cannot take away -- and that is the only true
richness.</p><p>(Marco's new name, Abhinavo, is to remind him that sannyas is the art
of</p><p>renewing oneself every moment. It is a constant rebirthing.)
1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>Die each moment to the past, don't let it hang around you, so each
moment you are fresh and young.</p><p>The past clings like dust and the past goes on growing bigger every
day, so layers and layers of dust accumulate on the mirror of
consciousness -- and that's the only problem. Because the mirror becomes
so covered it cannot reflect anything. It loses its mirrorlike quality
totally, it becomes blind.</p><p>One has to go on removing the dust. When the mirror is absolutely
fresh every moment you are continuously in contact with god. God simply
means that which is, so if you are capable of reflecting that which is
you are living in god.</p><p>(Niraj means a cloud, and the cloud is representative of freedom,
Osho explains.) It is untethered to anything, the whole sky is available
to it, it can move in any direction. It is so free that in fact it has
no destination at all, it is not going towards some address; it is
simply enjoying floating in the sun, on the winds. It is so totally free
that it is always ready to go with the wind wherever it is going.</p><p>Out of that freedom comes a second quality -- that of let-go. So it
is always in a state of let-go. The wind goes to the south, it goes to
the south. If the wind starts moving towards the north it does not say
'What is the matter? -- we were going to the south. How can you change
just in the middle of the journey?' No, it simply starts moving towards
the north. There is no problem, no resistance.</p><p>Freedom brings let-go, and because there is absolute let-go there is
no possibility of the ego. Ego needs resistance, fight, struggle, the
ego wants things according to its conditions. The cloud has no
conditions, it is unconditionally one with existence.</p><p>And that's what a sannyasin has to be -- a cloud, living in deep
let-go, freedom,</p><p>egolessness, living in such immense trust with existence that
everything is good. Life is good and death too.</p><p>When both are equally good one has come home. When there is nothing
to choose all anxiety disappears. When there is nothing to choose there
is nothing to lose either; whatsoever happens now is totally accepted as
a gift. And the gifts are always coming to the person who is ready to
receive. To live like a cloud is the true way of living.</p><p>Anand Samadhan.</p><p>It is not the solution to any particular problem, it is a solution
for all problems. Those who try to solve single problems are never going
to succeed because there are millions of problems. You can go on
solving; there will be no end to it. New problems are arising every day:
you can solve a few but meanwhile many more will have arisen.</p><p>One can go crazy in trying to solve problems individually. It is like
cutting the leaves of a tree. The tree is huge and you go on cutting the
leaves and new leaves go on coming up. Instead of one, three leaves will
pop up; you cut one and the tree will respond with three leaves. It will
become thicker, the foliage will be thicker because the tree takes on
the challenge; you cannot defeat it so easily. But cut the roots and the
whole tree is gone, all the leaves will fall on their own. But roots are
invisible and leaves are visible; hence many people go on pruning the
leaves for the whole of their life.</p><p>The case is exactly the same with man: the root of all problems is
the mind, but the mind is invisible.</p><p>The body is visible so people go on doing things with the body. They
will stand on their heads and they will think they are doing something
-- yoga -- that they are becoming spiritual by standing on their head.
They are only looking silly, that's all. You can go on distorting your
body this way and that -- that is not going to help.</p><p>A young man came to a Zen master. The Zen master asked, "Have you
ever been to another master before?" and the young man said, "Yes, I
have been to a certain master."</p><p>The Zen master asked, "What have you learned there?"</p><p>The young man said, "I will show you." He sat in the Buddha posture
and closed his eyes. The master hit him hard on the head with his staff
and said, "You fool! Get lost! Get out of here! We already have so many
stone buddhas in our temple</p><p>-- what are we going to do with you?"</p><p>Just sitting like a buddha is not going to help. It is easy to learn
because the body is visible but inside the mind is going crazy -- and
you are sitting like a buddha. You can fast, you can learn exercises,
you can chant mantras, because these things are visible -- but the real
thing is to become a witness of your mind.</p><p>Mind is not visible; it has no weight. Thoughts are not things; they
are weightless. That's why you can contain millions of thoughts. If they
had weight it would be impossible to contain so many thoughts in the
head; the head is so small.</p><p>As many weightless thoughts as you like can be contained. In fact
they say that a single man's mind is 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-4>Osho's books on

weightless, they don't occupy space; hence it is great work to be alert
about and watchful of these invisible things that surround you; but that
is the way to cut the root. And once you have seen the mind in all its
functionings, in all its craziness, and you have become detached, aloof,
you have seen that "I am not it," immediately bliss descends, showers on
you. In that showering all problems disappear.</p><p>Become a witness and you will attain to bliss -- and bliss becomes

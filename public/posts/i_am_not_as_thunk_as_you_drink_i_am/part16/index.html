Osho relates both meaning to meditation. ) Man can live either through thoughts or directly, without the mediation of thoughts . To live through thoughts is to live very half-heartedly, because then the contact with life is only partial. Thoughts function as barriers , they don't allow much of reality to enter you, and even if they do allow it they distort it. They are constantly making commentary on it , they are giving it colour and meaning of their own. They don't allow it in its authenticity; they falsify.\nTo live without the mediation of thought is meditation -- to live immediately, directly, putting the mind aside. When Jesus says to the devil 'Leave me alone, go behind me,' in a metaphorical way he is talking about the mind: Leave me\nalone, go behind me, don't come in front of me. There is no other devil except the mind. That is an ancient way of saying it. He is saying 'Let me live directly. I don't need your interpretation.\nI want to see reality as it is, utterly naked' -- and to experience reality in its total nakedness is to know god.\nBarbara is a Greek name. It has two meanings; both are significant. One is a stranger. The man of meditation becomes a stranger in the world because everybody is living through the mind and he is living without the mind. He is moving with people who will not be able to understand his language. He will be able to understand their language because he has lived their way too. He has known both lives, life with the mind and life without the mind, hence he will be able to understand them but they will not be able to understand him, They are bound to crucify such a man, they will be afraid because he is an absolute stranger.\nIf you know only Chinese and you come to India where nobody knows Chinese, you are not such a stranger; at least you can manage through gestures. The basic gestures are the same. If you are thirsty you can make a gesture, if you are hungry you can make a gesture, if you want to sleep you Can make a gesture.\nSlowly slowly you can get people to understand you and you can understand them. A bridge is possible.\nEven if some day man reaches a planet where he finds a totally different kind of people, there will still be a possibility to Communicate. But when a Buddha or a Jesus or a Zarathustra walks on earth he is really an outsider. He Cannot make any gestures because the thing that he has come to know is inexpressible in any way, by any means, hence he looks very dangerous, so different -- qualitatively different.\nBut these outsiders are the salt of the earth. There is some joy on earth, some song, some splendour because of these few outsiders. They have brought something of god into the world, something of the beyond to the earth. Of course they have suffered much; still they have given to the world that which is the greatest treasure.\nAnd hence the second meaning; the second meaning is coming with joy. Only a man of meditation can become a vehicle for joy, for bliss, for celebration.\nMeditation makes him a stranger in the world but at the same time, simultaneously makes him immensely blissful. Even if you take his life he loses nothing because he has attained to something which is far more than life itself; he has found eternal life.\n(The Dutch name, Joop, comes from Joseph; and Osho sees significance in the fact that Jesus was born of Joseph -- a name which means faithfulness and trust.) I don't believe in all that nonsense about Jesus being born through the holy ghost, that he was born out of a virgin mother. He was the son of the poor carpenter Joseph. It takes on a significant meaning: a man like Jesus can be born only out of trust, out of faithfulness.\nWhenever a person attains to Christ-consciousness he attains it through trust and faith. But remember trust and faith are not at all concerned with belief.\nBelief is of the head and trust -- or faith -- is of the heart. Belief is an idea, faith is an emotion. The very word 'emotion' is significant; it means that which can move you, e-motion. Belief cannot move you, you remain the same. You can believe in the Bible or in the Koran or in the Gita -- you remain the same. Your belief never changes anything in you; in fact belief is a way of avoiding change. It is the way of the coward and the cunning.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nOnly trust, faith, can transform you because it starts moving in your heart. Your heart starts beating with a new rhythm. A new source of joy, of knowing, of being, opens up with the faith. Belief is repression of doubt and faith is knowing of the truth. Belief remains ignorant, truth is full of light, the light that comes through knowing.\nKnow the truth and you will find great trust -- or allow trust to happen and you will find truth. It works both ways, one can begin from either end.\n(Osho mentions the concept of Gurdjieff's work in his next address. First he\nbegins by talking about meditation.)\nMeditation is a battle against darkness. It is an inner battle. You have to fight against all that is dark in you. You have to dispel all darkness, you have to create more and more light, awareness, alertness, attentiveness, so that night disappears. This darkness that exists in everybody is really ancient, very ancient, it may be thousands of lives old. But one thing is good, that howsoever old the darkness is, even a small candle can dispel it.\nMeditation is only a small candle in the beginning but it ends finally as thousands of suns rising within you. Just a small fire is enough to put the whole forest alight, but it is a battle because you have to fight to reclaim the territory that has become darkness.\nMan is just like an iceberg, only one-tenth is above the level of the water and nine-tenths is below.\nOne-tenth of our being is conscious, nine-tenths is unconscious, and the one- tenth has to fight against the nine-tenths. It is a great battle but light has the quality intrinsic to winning. Light is always fighting a winning battle and darkness is always fighting a losing battle. Darkness cannot win by its very nature. That's the only hope -- but it is a great hope.\nBegin the journey into sannyas with this hope, with tremendous joy. A great future is possible, a transformed life, a luminous life, but work is needed. In the East we have one word, 'sadhana'. It is untranslatable into English, but Gurdjieff has coined a word which comes very close to it. He used to call it\n'the work', the work of inner transformation.\nIn the Gurdjieffian circles what is called the work is exactly what we have called sadhana in the East, the fight to move beyond darkness into the realms of light, the fight to move beyond death into the world of immortality, the fight to move beyond untruth into the world of ultimate truth -- because except for truth nothing liberates.\n(The art of loving is not so much a question of accumulating anything but of discarding many things, Osho tells Prem Suviro.)\nThe greatest courage in life is to drop the ego, and the moment one drops the ego\nlove arises. One cannot practise love, a practised love is bound to be false. One cannot do anything positively for love because love is bigger than us. What can we do? Love has to do something for us, we cannot do anything for love. We are just small waves in the ocean of love. What can the wave do? It can dance with joy in the sun, in the wind, in the rain; while it is there it can dance, it comes dancing, it goes dancing. All that the wave can do is celebrate the moment, but the ocean can do much for the wave because the ocean is the source.\nLove is synonymous with god. Love is as vast as god so we cannot do anything positively. Anything done by us will be smaller than us. So the only course left is to remove the barriers; hence the whole work of moving into the world of love is negative. Drop the ego -- that is negative. Drop possessiveness -- that is negative. Drop jealousy -- that is negative. Drop hatred -- that is negative. Drop anger -- that is negative. All these are negatives, but if we can manage to do all these negatives the ultimate positive arises of its own accord. And when love comes of its own accord it is infinite. And only the infinite can make one fulfilled, less than that won't do. We are not made for that. Our innermost longing is for the infinite, the unbounded, the eternal.\nCourage is needed to destroy the barriers. We cling to the barriers. Man is so stupid he clings to the ego and loses the tremendous ecstasy of love. He clings to small jealousies -- absolutely absurd. In your saner moments you even see the absurdity of them, but when those insane moments take grip of you, you forget all your understanding.\nWhat are we trying to possess? In this world we come empty handed and we go empty handed so what is the point of being possessive? Just because one has mot a person on the way, just because for two hours you have been walking together on the same road, in the same direction, is it right to start claiming 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- possession?\nThe same is true about all our relationships. A son is born -- it is just being together on the road of infinity. There is no need to possess him. Rejoice in being\ntogether, share your joy, but don't possess him.\nThe moment the child is possessed, the child is paralysed, crippled. You meet a person and you feel great love and immediately possessiveness comes in. Remember, just a moment before you were not even acquainted and still you were there and the other person was there. Nobody is indispensable for anybody.\nYou have existed up to now and the other has existed. Just as a moment before you were not together, there is every possibility after a few moments you may not be together again. So why insist that now you always have to be together? That will destroy things, that will make slaves out of you -- and nobody likes a slave.\nEverybody hates both slavery and the person who is creating the slave. One may say so; one may not say, but it is bound to erupt in many ways: in anger, in hatred, in conflict.\nIf you see people who are in love you will be surprised -- they fight over such stupid things that one cannot believe that these people are sane, and still they believe that they are in love.\nLove exists but between love and the world there are a thousand and one barriers. And by the time love reaches the other it is no more love, it has become something else.\nRemove the barriers -- that is why courage is needed. And remember that we are basically alone. So it is good to enjoy when we are together -- with the son, with the friend, with the husband, with the wife, with the father, with the mother -- enjoy and feel grateful, obliged, that somebody walked by your side for a few hours, a few days, a few months. But there is no need to demand anything, there is no point in demanding.\nWe have no right to demand. When love is undemanding it is love. When it is just given with no idea of any return it becomes divine.\nThat's the way of the truly religious person. That's the way of my sannyasin.\n(Her new name , Anand Pathika, is to remind the Turkish sannyasin that she is now on the path of bliss.) Bliss is the keyword to be remembered. Whatsoever you do, do it blissfully. Since you are doing it, why not do it blissfully? Either do\nit or don't do it. If you have decided to do it then do it blissfully. And by doing anything blissfully small things become tremendously beautiful.\nIt is not a question of what you are doing, the real question is how you are doing it. Prayer has nothing to do with going to church or the temple. You can just wash the floor and it can be prayer if it is done blissfully, joyously. You can cook\n-- a friend is coming, a guest is coming, then a very ordinary thing, cooking something for the guest, for the friend, starts having a spiritual dimension.\nSpirituality is not other-worldliness. Spirituality is a way of living in this world meditatively, totally, blissfully. It is not against this world; in fact it enhances this world, enriches this world, it makes this world more beautiful, more blissful. But religions up to now have done just the opposite. They have made this earth a hell. I hold the so-called religions absolutely, categorically responsible for the misery that exists in the world.\nIf they had really worked in the right direction they would have transformed the whole world into paradise. But they thought paradise was somewhere above in the sky so they were in a hurry to reach there before others... and they have to stand in the queue. Everybody was in a hurry to reach there and nobody cared about this world. And this is the world which can be transformed either into hell or heaven; it all depends on how people live.\nMy sannyasins have to give a new perspective to humanity, a new spirituality, a new meaning, to the very world of spirituality, a new insight as to what it means to be religious. It simply means to be blissful twenty-four hours a day. of course one cannot be in a church twenty-four hours a day so life has to be transformed. Religion cannot be a separate thing from life, it has to spread all over life. Sitting, walking, sleeping, eating, swimming -- each small act has to be transformed into something sacred. That's what I call the path of bliss.\n(Osho warns Gyan Atita about the danger of mistaking knowledge for knowing.) The first step of sannyas is to go beyond knowledge. Knowledgeability is the greatest sin. It hinders one's growth more than anything else because it gives you a false notion that you know -- and you know not.\nIt is like a person suffering from cancer but who believes that he is perfectly healthy: just by his belief the cancer is not going to change. His belief is going to do only one thing; he will not go to any physician, he will not take any\ntreatment; he will miss that moment when it is curable and the cancer will go on 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\ngrowing. It does not bother about your belief.\nKnowledge hides your ignorance. And the thicker the knowledge becomes, the more you are oblivious of your real state. Hence I say the first step of a sannyasin is to throw off this whole blanket of knowledge.\nThere is no need to cover yourself; it is better to know that you are ignorant, because from that knowing the journey begins. One cannot remain with ignorance. If one knows one is ignorant, one starts searching for ways, means, devices, to get rid of ignorance.\nIt is not a question of hiding it, it is a question of destroying it. Meditation destroys ignorance and knowledge covers it. Knowledge is deceptive. It gives you an illusion of something that you are not, of somewhere you are not and it keeps you unaware of the place where you are. Meditation simply reveals to you where you are, what you are, and out of that insight the journey begins. You start moving more and more deeply into meditation, more and more into silence. And a moment comes when the silence is profound; it becomes a flame and all ignorance is burned, is dispersed.\nTranscend knowledge if you want to be wise. If you want to remain a fool then go on collecting knowledge. Fools are great scholars, fools are great pundits. They are great fool-osophers. Avoid fool-osophy, be innocent like a child.\n(Nigel, a social psychologist from England. is given the name Anand Bhajan -- a sacred song of bliss.) There is a difference between an ordinary song and a sacred song. The difference is not of words, the difference is not of composition; the difference is somewhere within you, not in the song itself. One can sing a film song in a sacred way, then it becomes a bhajan. And one can sing a so- called sacred song in such a stupid way that it becomes very mundane.\nMy emphasis is always on you, not what you do but what you are, From you comes the quality. You are the source, the song becomes what you are.\nI see these Hare Krishna people, they think they are singing devotional songs, sacred songs. I have seen many kinds of fools in the world but Hare Krishna people are at the top, nobody can defeat them, they are so stupid. I always feel that this man, Prabhupad, must have had in him a magnetic energy that attracted fools, because I have never come across a single Hare Krishna person who has any intelligence. It seems his appeal was only for the unintelligent. They go on singing sacred songs but their singing is just like parrots.\nYou can teach parrots anything.\nA mother found out that her small child was teaching their parrot four-letter words. She was of course very angry and she said 'What are you doing? teaching four-letter words to the parrot?' He said 'No, Mummy, I'm simply telling him \"These are the words you are not to use!\" Just the way you tell me these words are not to be used, I'm telling the parrot!'\nThe mother has taught the child, now the child is teaching the parrot. And the parrot will learn. This is how mischief goes on passing from one generation to another generation.\nFor a song to be sacred two things are needed. One is silence in your heart. That is not possible without meditation. And the second is blissfulness. Silence alone won't do. It may be there but it will not explode into songs. When silence and bliss meet then there is bhajan, the sacred song. The meeting point of silence and bliss creates a miracle; your song has something of your silence and something of your bliss together.\nThen whatsoever you sing... you may simply utter nonsense words but they will have sacred quality.\nA Christian sect uses a certain beautiful method -- I like it. It is one -- of the secrets that has been followed by many mystics down the ages. It is called glossolalia. One simply relaxes, becomes silent, and then whatsoever comes one allows it -- gibberish, nonsense words, sounds. One has not to prevent anything.\none has to enjoy whatsoever is coming. The word 'gibberish' comes from a great mystic's name; his name was Jabar, a Sufi mystic.\nYou ask him a very rational question and he will utter some absurd words or meaningless sounds, you cannot figure out what he is saying, what he means. But you can see his joy and you can see his silence.\nThat is his message, whatsoever the question, that is his answer. It is from Jabar that the English word\n'gibberish\" has arisen. Gibberish is called glossolalia, a divine language, by this certain sect of Christians.\nYou are not speaking, something is speaking through you. You are simply silent, then an urge arises in you to shout -- you shout. An urge arises in you to jump and you jump, and you jog and you dance. You simply follow the inner feel, and then it is bhajan, then it is sacred.\nAnd that has to be the method for you. I have been watching you -- it is possible for you, you can become a Jabar. Try it! -- How long will you be here? -- About six months. -- Do some gibberish.\n(The group laughs. From Bhajan there is a pause of disbelief.) -- What now? 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\n(Osho chuckles.)\nRight now! (With scarcely a moment's hesitation, Bhajan closes his eyes and babbles incoherently for a few seconds, then breaks off suddenly in laughter.) -- Good. You will be able to do it. Good!\n(Dhyan Deva. Dhyan means meditation, Deva means god.)\nThe way to god is meditation. Meditation means a state of no-mind. Mind is the way to the outside world and no-mind is the way to the inside world. If you want to approach the world you have to become more and more of a mind. That's what\na scientist becomes: more and more a mind, To reach farther into the exterior reality, that is the only way. For science it is the only valid method.\nBut if you want to go inwards you have to retrace your steps, you have to become less and less of a mind. Then the ultimate change, you start becoming a no-mind. When you have come to the full point of being a no-mind, when nothing is left of the mind, all the mind is gone, you simply are, just being. The throbbing of the heart is heard, even the pulsation of the blood is felt. but there are no thoughts, no feelings.\nno moods -- all is quiet and calm. You are just sitting or just standing.\nA Zen master was standing on a hilltop. Three people had come for a morning walk and they started arguing about what he was doing. One said 'As far as I know his cow sometimes gets lost so he goes to the top of the hill and from there he looks around for where the cow is -- it is easier from there to see all around.\nSo he must be looking for the cow.'\nThe second man said 'I don't think it is so because I don't see him moving at all. If he were looking for the cow at least his head would be moving, searching all around. But he is standing just like a statue, he cannot be looking for his cow.'My feeling is,' said the second man, 'that he is waiting for some friend who came with him but has been left behind.'\nThe third said, 'I cannot agree because if he were waiting for somebody then once in a while he would look back, wondering why he has not come yet, where he has gone, how long he is going to take -- but he never looks back. This is not the way of a man who is waiting for somebody.'\nThey could not agree so they all travelled to the peak, reached the master and asked him... the first man asked 'Are you looking for your cow?' And the master said ' My cow? I have come into the world without anything and I will go from the world without anything. Nothing is mine. Even my body is not mine, my mind is not mine. I don't exist at all -- what nonsense you are talking. What cow?'\nThe second man said 'Then I must be right, you must be waiting for the friend who came with you for a morning walk, who is left behind.' The master said 'Friend? But I don't have any enemy in the world so how can I have a friend?\nYou can have friends only if you have enemies. The more friends you have, the more enemies you have.' And the master said 'I am not interested either in friends or in enemies. I have come alone and I will go alone. Between these two alonenesses why get into trouble unnecessarily? I am alone.'\nThe third man jumped up. He said 'Then I must be right. I told these people that he is not looking for his cow, not looking for his friend, he is meditating. The way he is standing, utterly still, he must be meditating.'\nAnd the master said 'Meditating? Do you think meditation is an act? I am not meditating, I am not doing anything; I am simply standing.'\nBut that's exactly what meditation is: simply standing or simply sitting, simply being. The moment you are in that space you know what god is. And to know god is to know all, to know god is to be a god. And that is the unfoldment of your being, the ultimate flowering of the one-thousand-petalled lotus of your consciousness.

CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>[NOTE: This is an unedited tape transcript of an unpublished darshan
diary, which has been scanned and cleaned up. It is for reference
purposes only.]</p><p>(Barbara means a stranger, and, coming with joy. Osho relates both
meaning to meditation. ) Man can live either through thoughts or
directly, without the mediation of thoughts . To live through thoughts
is to live very half-heartedly, because then the contact with life is
only partial. Thoughts function as barriers , they don't allow much of
reality to enter you, and even if they do allow it they distort it. They
are constantly making commentary on it , they are giving it colour and
meaning of their own. They don't allow it in its authenticity; they
falsify.</p><p>To live without the mediation of thought is meditation -- to live
immediately, directly, putting the mind aside. When Jesus says to the
devil 'Leave me alone, go behind me,' in a metaphorical way he is
talking about the mind: Leave me</p><p>alone, go behind me, don't come in front of me. There is no other
devil except the mind. That is an ancient way of saying it. He is saying
'Let me live directly. I don't need your interpretation.</p><p>I want to see reality as it is, utterly naked' -- and to experience
reality in its total nakedness is to know god.</p><p>Barbara is a Greek name. It has two meanings; both are significant.
One is a stranger. The man of meditation becomes a stranger in the world
because everybody is living through the mind and he is living without
the mind. He is moving with people who will not be able to understand
his language. He will be able to understand their language because he
has lived their way too. He has known both lives, life with the mind and
life without the mind, hence he will be able to understand them but they
will not be able to understand him, They are bound to crucify such a
man, they will be afraid because he is an absolute stranger.</p><p>If you know only Chinese and you come to India where nobody knows
Chinese, you are not such a stranger; at least you can manage through
gestures. The basic gestures are the same. If you are thirsty you can
make a gesture, if you are hungry you can make a gesture, if you want to
sleep you Can make a gesture.</p><p>Slowly slowly you can get people to understand you and you can
understand them. A bridge is possible.</p><p>Even if some day man reaches a planet where he finds a totally
different kind of people, there will still be a possibility to
Communicate. But when a Buddha or a Jesus or a Zarathustra walks on
earth he is really an outsider. He Cannot make any gestures because the
thing that he has come to know is inexpressible in any way, by any
means, hence he looks very dangerous, so different -- qualitatively
different.</p><p>But these outsiders are the salt of the earth. There is some joy on
earth, some song, some splendour because of these few outsiders. They
have brought something of god into the world, something of the beyond to
the earth. Of course they have suffered much; still they have given to
the world that which is the greatest treasure.</p><p>And hence the second meaning; the second meaning is coming with joy.
Only a man of meditation can become a vehicle for joy, for bliss, for
celebration.</p><p>Meditation makes him a stranger in the world but at the same time,
simultaneously makes him immensely blissful. Even if you take his life
he loses nothing because he has attained to something which is far more
than life itself; he has found eternal life.</p><p>(The Dutch name, Joop, comes from Joseph; and Osho sees significance
in the fact that Jesus was born of Joseph -- a name which means
faithfulness and trust.) I don't believe in all that nonsense about
Jesus being born through the holy ghost, that he was born out of a
virgin mother. He was the son of the poor carpenter Joseph. It takes on
a significant meaning: a man like Jesus can be born only out of trust,
out of faithfulness.</p><p>Whenever a person attains to Christ-consciousness he attains it
through trust and faith. But remember trust and faith are not at all
concerned with belief.</p><p>Belief is of the head and trust -- or faith -- is of the heart.
Belief is an idea, faith is an emotion. The very word 'emotion' is
significant; it means that which can move you, e-motion. Belief cannot
move you, you remain the same. You can believe in the Bible or in the
Koran or in the Gita -- you remain the same. Your belief never changes
anything in you; in fact belief is a way of avoiding change. It is the
way of the coward and the cunning.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>Only trust, faith, can transform you because it starts moving in your
heart. Your heart starts beating with a new rhythm. A new source of joy,
of knowing, of being, opens up with the faith. Belief is repression of
doubt and faith is knowing of the truth. Belief remains ignorant, truth
is full of light, the light that comes through knowing.</p><p>Know the truth and you will find great trust -- or allow trust to
happen and you will find truth. It works both ways, one can begin from
either end.</p><p>(Osho mentions the concept of Gurdjieff's work in his next address.
First he</p><p>begins by talking about meditation.)</p><p>Meditation is a battle against darkness. It is an inner battle. You
have to fight against all that is dark in you. You have to dispel all
darkness, you have to create more and more light, awareness, alertness,
attentiveness, so that night disappears. This darkness that exists in
everybody is really ancient, very ancient, it may be thousands of lives
old. But one thing is good, that howsoever old the darkness is, even a
small candle can dispel it.</p><p>Meditation is only a small candle in the beginning but it ends
finally as thousands of suns rising within you. Just a small fire is
enough to put the whole forest alight, but it is a battle because you
have to fight to reclaim the territory that has become darkness.</p><p>Man is just like an iceberg, only one-tenth is above the level of the
water and nine-tenths is below.</p><p>One-tenth of our being is conscious, nine-tenths is unconscious, and
the one- tenth has to fight against the nine-tenths. It is a great
battle but light has the quality intrinsic to winning. Light is always
fighting a winning battle and darkness is always fighting a losing
battle. Darkness cannot win by its very nature. That's the only hope --
but it is a great hope.</p><p>Begin the journey into sannyas with this hope, with tremendous joy. A
great future is possible, a transformed life, a luminous life, but work
is needed. In the East we have one word, 'sadhana'. It is untranslatable
into English, but Gurdjieff has coined a word which comes very close to
it. He used to call it</p><p>'the work', the work of inner transformation.</p><p>In the Gurdjieffian circles what is called the work is exactly what
we have called sadhana in the East, the fight to move beyond darkness
into the realms of light, the fight to move beyond death into the world
of immortality, the fight to move beyond untruth into the world of
ultimate truth -- because except for truth nothing liberates.</p><p>(The art of loving is not so much a question of accumulating anything
but of discarding many things, Osho tells Prem Suviro.)</p><p>The greatest courage in life is to drop the ego, and the moment one
drops the ego</p><p>love arises. One cannot practise love, a practised love is bound to
be false. One cannot do anything positively for love because love is
bigger than us. What can we do? Love has to do something for us, we
cannot do anything for love. We are just small waves in the ocean of
love. What can the wave do? It can dance with joy in the sun, in the
wind, in the rain; while it is there it can dance, it comes dancing, it
goes dancing. All that the wave can do is celebrate the moment, but the
ocean can do much for the wave because the ocean is the source.</p><p>Love is synonymous with god. Love is as vast as god so we cannot do
anything positively. Anything done by us will be smaller than us. So the
only course left is to remove the barriers; hence the whole work of
moving into the world of love is negative. Drop the ego -- that is
negative. Drop possessiveness -- that is negative. Drop jealousy -- that
is negative. Drop hatred -- that is negative. Drop anger -- that is
negative. All these are negatives, but if we can manage to do all these
negatives the ultimate positive arises of its own accord. And when love
comes of its own accord it is infinite. And only the infinite can make
one fulfilled, less than that won't do. We are not made for that. Our
innermost longing is for the infinite, the unbounded, the eternal.</p><p>Courage is needed to destroy the barriers. We cling to the barriers.
Man is so stupid he clings to the ego and loses the tremendous ecstasy
of love. He clings to small jealousies -- absolutely absurd. In your
saner moments you even see the absurdity of them, but when those insane
moments take grip of you, you forget all your understanding.</p><p>What are we trying to possess? In this world we come empty handed and
we go empty handed so what is the point of being possessive? Just
because one has mot a person on the way, just because for two hours you
have been walking together on the same road, in the same direction, is
it right to start claiming 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:- possession?</p><p>The same is true about all our relationships. A son is born -- it is
just being together on the road of infinity. There is no need to possess
him. Rejoice in being</p><p>together, share your joy, but don't possess him.</p><p>The moment the child is possessed, the child is paralysed, crippled.
You meet a person and you feel great love and immediately possessiveness
comes in. Remember, just a moment before you were not even acquainted
and still you were there and the other person was there. Nobody is
indispensable for anybody.</p><p>You have existed up to now and the other has existed. Just as a
moment before you were not together, there is every possibility after a
few moments you may not be together again. So why insist that now you
always have to be together? That will destroy things, that will make
slaves out of you -- and nobody likes a slave.</p><p>Everybody hates both slavery and the person who is creating the
slave. One may say so; one may not say, but it is bound to erupt in many
ways: in anger, in hatred, in conflict.</p><p>If you see people who are in love you will be surprised -- they fight
over such stupid things that one cannot believe that these people are
sane, and still they believe that they are in love.</p><p>Love exists but between love and the world there are a thousand and
one barriers. And by the time love reaches the other it is no more love,
it has become something else.</p><p>Remove the barriers -- that is why courage is needed. And remember
that we are basically alone. So it is good to enjoy when we are together
-- with the son, with the friend, with the husband, with the wife, with
the father, with the mother -- enjoy and feel grateful, obliged, that
somebody walked by your side for a few hours, a few days, a few months.
But there is no need to demand anything, there is no point in
demanding.</p><p>We have no right to demand. When love is undemanding it is love. When
it is just given with no idea of any return it becomes divine.</p><p>That's the way of the truly religious person. That's the way of my
sannyasin.</p><p>(Her new name , Anand Pathika, is to remind the Turkish sannyasin
that she is now on the path of bliss.) Bliss is the keyword to be
remembered. Whatsoever you do, do it blissfully. Since you are doing it,
why not do it blissfully? Either do</p><p>it or don't do it. If you have decided to do it then do it
blissfully. And by doing anything blissfully small things become
tremendously beautiful.</p><p>It is not a question of what you are doing, the real question is how
you are doing it. Prayer has nothing to do with going to church or the
temple. You can just wash the floor and it can be prayer if it is done
blissfully, joyously. You can cook</p><p>-- a friend is coming, a guest is coming, then a very ordinary thing,
cooking something for the guest, for the friend, starts having a
spiritual dimension.</p><p>Spirituality is not other-worldliness. Spirituality is a way of
living in this world meditatively, totally, blissfully. It is not
against this world; in fact it enhances this world, enriches this world,
it makes this world more beautiful, more blissful. But religions up to
now have done just the opposite. They have made this earth a hell. I
hold the so-called religions absolutely, categorically responsible for
the misery that exists in the world.</p><p>If they had really worked in the right direction they would have
transformed the whole world into paradise. But they thought paradise was
somewhere above in the sky so they were in a hurry to reach there before
others... and they have to stand in the queue. Everybody was in a hurry
to reach there and nobody cared about this world. And this is the world
which can be transformed either into hell or heaven; it all depends on
how people live.</p><p>My sannyasins have to give a new perspective to humanity, a new
spirituality, a new meaning, to the very world of spirituality, a new
insight as to what it means to be religious. It simply means to be
blissful twenty-four hours a day. of course one cannot be in a church
twenty-four hours a day so life has to be transformed. Religion cannot
be a separate thing from life, it has to spread all over life. Sitting,
walking, sleeping, eating, swimming -- each small act has to be
transformed into something sacred. That's what I call the path of
bliss.</p><p>(Osho warns Gyan Atita about the danger of mistaking knowledge for
knowing.) The first step of sannyas is to go beyond knowledge.
Knowledgeability is the greatest sin. It hinders one's growth more than
anything else because it gives you a false notion that you know -- and
you know not.</p><p>It is like a person suffering from cancer but who believes that he is
perfectly healthy: just by his belief the cancer is not going to change.
His belief is going to do only one thing; he will not go to any
physician, he will not take any</p><p>treatment; he will miss that moment when it is curable and the cancer
will go on 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>growing. It does not bother about your belief.</p><p>Knowledge hides your ignorance. And the thicker the knowledge
becomes, the more you are oblivious of your real state. Hence I say the
first step of a sannyasin is to throw off this whole blanket of
knowledge.</p><p>There is no need to cover yourself; it is better to know that you are
ignorant, because from that knowing the journey begins. One cannot
remain with ignorance. If one knows one is ignorant, one starts
searching for ways, means, devices, to get rid of ignorance.</p><p>It is not a question of hiding it, it is a question of destroying it.
Meditation destroys ignorance and knowledge covers it. Knowledge is
deceptive. It gives you an illusion of something that you are not, of
somewhere you are not and it keeps you unaware of the place where you
are. Meditation simply reveals to you where you are, what you are, and
out of that insight the journey begins. You start moving more and more
deeply into meditation, more and more into silence. And a moment comes
when the silence is profound; it becomes a flame and all ignorance is
burned, is dispersed.</p><p>Transcend knowledge if you want to be wise. If you want to remain a
fool then go on collecting knowledge. Fools are great scholars, fools
are great pundits. They are great fool-osophers. Avoid fool-osophy, be
innocent like a child.</p><p>(Nigel, a social psychologist from England. is given the name Anand
Bhajan -- a sacred song of bliss.) There is a difference between an
ordinary song and a sacred song. The difference is not of words, the
difference is not of composition; the difference is somewhere within
you, not in the song itself. One can sing a film song in a sacred way,
then it becomes a bhajan. And one can sing a so- called sacred song in
such a stupid way that it becomes very mundane.</p><p>My emphasis is always on you, not what you do but what you are, From
you comes the quality. You are the source, the song becomes what you
are.</p><p>I see these Hare Krishna people, they think they are singing
devotional songs, sacred songs. I have seen many kinds of fools in the
world but Hare Krishna people are at the top, nobody can defeat them,
they are so stupid. I always feel that this man, Prabhupad, must have
had in him a magnetic energy that attracted fools, because I have never
come across a single Hare Krishna person who has any intelligence. It
seems his appeal was only for the unintelligent. They go on singing
sacred songs but their singing is just like parrots.</p><p>You can teach parrots anything.</p><p>A mother found out that her small child was teaching their parrot
four-letter words. She was of course very angry and she said 'What are
you doing? teaching four-letter words to the parrot?' He said 'No,
Mummy, I'm simply telling him "These are the words you are not to use!"
Just the way you tell me these words are not to be used, I'm telling the
parrot!'</p><p>The mother has taught the child, now the child is teaching the
parrot. And the parrot will learn. This is how mischief goes on passing
from one generation to another generation.</p><p>For a song to be sacred two things are needed. One is silence in your
heart. That is not possible without meditation. And the second is
blissfulness. Silence alone won't do. It may be there but it will not
explode into songs. When silence and bliss meet then there is bhajan,
the sacred song. The meeting point of silence and bliss creates a
miracle; your song has something of your silence and something of your
bliss together.</p><p>Then whatsoever you sing... you may simply utter nonsense words but
they will have sacred quality.</p><p>A Christian sect uses a certain beautiful method -- I like it. It is
one -- of the secrets that has been followed by many mystics down the
ages. It is called glossolalia. One simply relaxes, becomes silent, and
then whatsoever comes one allows it -- gibberish, nonsense words,
sounds. One has not to prevent anything.</p><p>one has to enjoy whatsoever is coming. The word 'gibberish' comes
from a great mystic's name; his name was Jabar, a Sufi mystic.</p><p>You ask him a very rational question and he will utter some absurd
words or meaningless sounds, you cannot figure out what he is saying,
what he means. But you can see his joy and you can see his silence.</p><p>That is his message, whatsoever the question, that is his answer. It
is from Jabar that the English word</p><p>'gibberish" has arisen. Gibberish is called glossolalia, a divine
language, by this certain sect of Christians.</p><p>You are not speaking, something is speaking through you. You are
simply silent, then an urge arises in you to shout -- you shout. An urge
arises in you to jump and you jump, and you jog and you dance. You
simply follow the inner feel, and then it is bhajan, then it is
sacred.</p><p>And that has to be the method for you. I have been watching you -- it
is possible for you, you can become a Jabar. Try it! -- How long will
you be here? -- About six months. -- Do some gibberish.</p><p>(The group laughs. From Bhajan there is a pause of disbelief.) --
What now? 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:justify id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-4>Osho's books on

eyes and babbles incoherently for a few seconds, then breaks off
suddenly in laughter.) -- Good. You will be able to do it. Good!</p><p>(Dhyan Deva. Dhyan means meditation, Deva means god.)</p><p>The way to god is meditation. Meditation means a state of no-mind.
Mind is the way to the outside world and no-mind is the way to the
inside world. If you want to approach the world you have to become more
and more of a mind. That's what</p><p>a scientist becomes: more and more a mind, To reach farther into the
exterior reality, that is the only way. For science it is the only valid
method.</p><p>But if you want to go inwards you have to retrace your steps, you
have to become less and less of a mind. Then the ultimate change, you
start becoming a no-mind. When you have come to the full point of being
a no-mind, when nothing is left of the mind, all the mind is gone, you
simply are, just being. The throbbing of the heart is heard, even the
pulsation of the blood is felt. but there are no thoughts, no
feelings.</p><p>no moods -- all is quiet and calm. You are just sitting or just
standing.</p><p>A Zen master was standing on a hilltop. Three people had come for a
morning walk and they started arguing about what he was doing. One said
'As far as I know his cow sometimes gets lost so he goes to the top of
the hill and from there he looks around for where the cow is -- it is
easier from there to see all around.</p><p>So he must be looking for the cow.'</p><p>The second man said 'I don't think it is so because I don't see him
moving at all. If he were looking for the cow at least his head would be
moving, searching all around. But he is standing just like a statue, he
cannot be looking for his cow.'My feeling is,' said the second man,
'that he is waiting for some friend who came with him but has been left
behind.'</p><p>The third said, 'I cannot agree because if he were waiting for
somebody then once in a while he would look back, wondering why he has
not come yet, where he has gone, how long he is going to take -- but he
never looks back. This is not the way of a man who is waiting for
somebody.'</p><p>They could not agree so they all travelled to the peak, reached the
master and asked him... the first man asked 'Are you looking for your
cow?' And the master said ' <em>My</em> cow? I have come into the world
without anything and I will go from the world without anything. Nothing
is mine. Even my body is not mine, my mind is not mine. I don't exist at
all -- what nonsense you are talking. What cow?'</p><p>The second man said 'Then I must be right, you must be waiting for
the friend who came with you for a morning walk, who is left behind.'
The master said 'Friend? But I don't have any enemy in the world so how
can I have a friend?</p><p>You can have friends only if you have enemies. The more friends you
have, the more enemies you have.' And the master said 'I am not
interested either in friends or in enemies. I have come alone and I will
go alone. Between these two alonenesses why get into trouble
unnecessarily? I am alone.'</p><p>The third man jumped up. He said 'Then I must be right. I told these
people that he is not looking for his cow, not looking for his friend,
he is meditating. The way he is standing, utterly still, he must be
meditating.'</p><p>And the master said 'Meditating? Do you think meditation is an act? I
am not meditating, I am not doing anything; I am simply standing.'</p><p>But that's exactly what meditation is: simply standing or simply
sitting, simply being. The moment you are in that space you know what
god is. And to know god is to know all, to know god is to be a god. And

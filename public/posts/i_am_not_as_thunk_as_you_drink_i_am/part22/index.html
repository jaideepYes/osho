It is for reference purposes only.]\n(To Muriel Osho talks of the three dimensions of joy -- pleasure, happiness and bliss.) One can have pleasures without meditation because pleasures are of the body, but one cannot have joy without meditation. Joy belongs to the spirit. Pleasures belong to the body, happiness to the mind and joy to the soul.\nFor pleasures everybody is equipped by nature, because it is our animal heritage, it is our past, it is instinct -- it is already there, fully developed. For happiness you have to do something. Happiness is human, a little bit above the anima. Pleasure con-sists of only two things, food and see -- those are the two polarities of pleasure. Happiness consists of many things, but for happiness one has to grow sensitivity and creativity.\nTo be happy is an art.\nOne has to learn music, then one can be happy with it. One can learn painting, poetry, sculpture, gardening . there are thousands of possibilities. As you rise above the mind and you start becoming a little artful and alert about the dimensions available and you start using all those doors, you learn something more than any animal can ever do. No animal can enjoy painting, no animal can enjoy poetry; it is not possible.\nAnd no animal can be condemned for that. If it is not possible what can animals do? But if man is not able to enjoy music then he should be condemned; he is living lower than he is capable of.\nJoy comes at the ultimate peak. It belongs to the soul. For that you have to learn to be meditative.\nPleasure is dual; sex and food are the two polarities. Happiness is multi- dimensional. Joy is one; it is neither two nor many. Joy has simply one taste -- the taste of silence, the taste of no-mind.\nIf one wants to be full of joy one has to nut both body and mind behind one, one has to transcend both.\nMeditation is the transcendence of the body-mind structure, it is to become aware of both body and mind. The moment you are aware of both you are separate; the moment you are aware of both you are above both. That quality of beyondness is joy. -- How long will you be here?\n(Her reply is inaudible, save to Osho.)\nThen come back again... the day after tomorrow! (much laughter) Or any day after tomorrow! Okay?\n(She nods laughingly as she rises to leave.)\n(Osho explains the connection between Krista's name and the words 'Christ' and 'Krishna'.) The very word 'Christ' comes from the Sanskrit work 'Krishna'. From Krishna it has moved into many languages and ultimately it has become Christ. In its long journey from Krishna to Christ, Krista has been one of the very significant milestones. Krista is exactly halfway in the journey from Krishna to Christ. In 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nfact in Bengali, one of the Indian languages, Krishna is called Krista, he is not\ncalled Krishna.\nChrist is not a personal name of Jesus. His name is Jesus. The moment he attains to the ultimate he is called Christ. In the East we have called that state Krishna; it is the same word and the same state too.\nYour name will mean Christ-consciousness. And that is the goal of sannyas, to become crowned wit consciousness.\nMan lives in unconsciousness. He lives like a robot. The major part of his being is in darkness; just a little bit has come out of the darkness, just the tip of the iceberg -- and that too is very fragile. At any moment it goes back again into darkness. Somebody insults you and you lose your consciousness. It is very fragile. You become unconscious, you start behaving in an unconscious way, and later on you yourself recognise it. You wonder 'How did I do all this?' You start saying 'It happened in spite of me. I never wanted to do it.'\nPeople have done things in anger which only insane people can do -- and they were not insane, they were as sane as anybody else, but in anger they lose consciousness, in passion they lose consciousness.\nThere are a thousand and one situations every day when we lose consciousness, so that small portion of consciousness is not very effective either. If one is alert about using it rightly the only purpose is to meditate with that small piece of consciousness that you have not, because through meditation more and more of the unconscious starts becoming conscious, more and more of your hidden darkness starts disappearing.\nRight now ninety per cent is unconscious, ten per cent is conscious. As you meditate, slowly, fifteen per cont becomes conscious, twenty per cent becomes conscious. The moment there is at least fifty per cent of consciousness and fifty per cent of unconsciousness, then you can rely upon your consciousness because now there is a balance; the unconscious cannot easily take over.\nWhen there is sixty per cent of consciousness and only forty per cent of unconsciousness, you can move with certainty in life. Somebody can insult you and you will remain unaffected. When ninety per cent becomes conscious and only ten per cent is left unconscious the first satori happens, the first glimpse of reality. And in that ten per cent many satoris happen; thousands of satoris can happen, but at least three are absolutely necessary.\nAs that ten per cent is transformed into consciousness it is transformed in three parts. The first part gives you the first satori, the second part the second satori, and the third part gives you samadhi. When one hundred per cent of your being is conscious we call it samadhi. The very word 'samadhi' means that one has arrived at absolute equanimity, at absolute equilibrium. Now nothing can disturb you, even death cannot disturb you.\nThat is the goal of sannyas, to arrive at one hundred per cent consciousness. At that moment one is a Christ, a Krishna, a Buddha, or whatsoever name one wants to use. These are just names, but the real thing is one hundred per cent consciousness. And it is possible; everybody is born with the potential, we just have to work upon it to change it. And that small piece of consciousness can be used to transform the whole being into consciousness. It can become a triggering point.\nIt is a small light but we can create more and more light through it. It is just a small candle but more candles can be lit by it. A chain of candles can be lit through it and your whole life becomes a festival of light.\nIn India every year we celebrate one night, the festival of lights. People burn thousands of candles and small lamps. The whole country celebrates the festival of lights. That night is the night when Mahavira, one of the greatest mystics ever, became enlightened. And it is a very special night in that way because Mahavira is the only person who became enlightened on the darkest night.\nBuddha became enlightened on the full-moon night and Mahavira became enlightened on the no-moon night. That is very significant, it is a very rare phenomenon. Almost all enlightened people have become enlightened either on a full-moon night or very close to it. Except for Mahavira I have never come across another person who has become enlightened on the darkest night. Hence we celebrate that night, the darkest night, as the festival of lights.\nBut people have completely forgotten the significance; they go on observing the festival as a ritual.\nThere are thousands who don't even connect it with Mahavir. There are millions who don't even know the name of Mahavir or know that it has anything to do with Mahavir..\nBut it shows one thing, that even if you are living in the darkest night, there is a\npossibility that it can be transformed into a festival of light. So there is no need to feel hopeless -- even the darkest night has a dawn to it.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\n(Sergio means to serve. Prem means love -- and the only real service is that which arises out of love.) One can serve without love, but then that service has no spiritual dimension to it. It may be rooted either in fear or in greed. For example, Christian missionaries go on serving humanity. It is not out of love but out of the fear of hell and the greed for heaven. They don't know what love is; their whole effort is to attain to heavenly pleasures. It is sheer greed and lust and they are also afraid of the pains and the agonies and the sufferings of hell. They are using poor people, exploiting them for some gain in the other world. But this is not true service. There are motives behind it.\nThe service is true only when it is unmotivated, and there is only one thing which is unmotivated -- that is love. So unless service is rooted in love it is false.\nI teach love because I know if love arises in you, service will come as a shadow of it. And then you will not serve for some reward, you will serve because you enjoy it. Then there will be no end to your service, then your service will be an end unto itself.\nAnd the greatest bliss is when your means and your ends are one, when they are not separated in time.\nWhen whatsoever you are doing is an end unto itself, then there is bliss.\nAnand Vinito. A miserable person is never humble. He cannot afford to be humble. He is so miserable that he has to hide it by projecting his ego. He magnifies his ego to hide his misery, his poverty, his inner emptiness. He goes on making the balloon of the ego bigger and bigger so it hides everything. The miserable person cannot be humble -- even if he tries to show humbleness, that will be just another way of proving his superiority. That will be just another trip\nof the ego, another number -- nothing else.\nBut the blissful person is naturally humble. There is no need for the ego. We need the ego to hide our emptiness. The blissful person is so full that there is no question of hiding anything; he can stand naked in the sun. The blissful person has so much bliss in his being that ego cannot have any appeal for him. What is there for the ego to give to the blissful person? He has got everything -- more than he needs.\nThere is a Sufi story.…\nA king had gone to hunt but he and his party got lost in the jungle. They were all searching for the way back to the capital.\nA blind mystic used to live in the jungle with one of his followers. One man of the king's party came and said, \"Hey, blind man, do you know which is the way to the capital?\" The mystic laughed and he said, \"Yes.\nYou are a soldier of the king, you must have come with his party. Go this way and after one mile you will find the road to the capital.\"\nThe follower was very much mystified because he knew his master was blind -- how did he come to know that this man was a soldier?\nAnd then another man came. He said to the blind man, \"Sir, can you show me the way? I have got lost in this jungle.\" And the blind man said, \"Yes. You must be the prime minister. This is the way -- after one mile you will find the road to the capital.\"\nThe follower was even more mystified, but he kept silent and he waited. In the night, when they went to rest, he would ask the master how he knew -- because certainly this man looked like he was the prime minister.\nAnd then the king himself came and he touched the feet of the mystic and said, \"Please show me the way.\" And he said, \"Yes, I know -- you are the king of this country. This is the way.\"\nIn the night, the follower asked the master, \"This is the first time that you have behaved strangely, not like a blind man. And every time you were right -- how did you manage it?\"\nThe mystic said, \"There was nothing to manage. The soldier behaved arrogantly\n-- that simply shows he is a miserable person, he must be of the lowest rank. The prime minister addressed me as \"Sir\". That simply shows he belongs to a higher rank; he is a man of culture, education -- polished, rich. And the king touched my feet because he has nothing to lose and he has no need to show his arrogance, his ego. It was a simple inference, you need not be mystified,\" said the old man. \"I cannot see-you know that perfectly well -- but I just inferred that the man who touches my feet and asks so politely must be the king. It was just a coincidence that my inferences fitted well; I cannot see who is who, but the way they were behaving showed something.\"\nThis story is beautiful: the most blissful person, the person who is a king of the inner world, will be absolutely egoless. He will be humble. Those who are beggars in their spiritual world are very egoistic, they cannot be humble.\nSo remember, your name means bliss, humbleness. Bliss has to be the foundation of all humbleness.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nBecome blissful and you will find humbleness; there is no need to cultivate it. A cultivated humbleness is false. It is not humbleness -- it is all humbug! An uncultivated humbleness which comes as a fragrance of bliss is beautiful, is real, is true. And only that which is true is worth achieving. The false simply takes your time, your energy, and gives you nothing -- it is a sheer wastage.\n(The last sannyasin, a Japanese woman -- a doll-maker -- had wept as she sat with the others awaiting her turn. Osho tells her that the meaning of her new name and the direction of her new life is the path of devotion.)\nYou don't need anything else!\nThere are three paths. One is of meditation, of awareness. The second is of action, of serving god. And the third is of devotion, of just loving god. The third\nis your path. Just totally love existence because it is visible god. Love the whole creation because everywhere is the signature of god. On the trees, on the birds, on the animals, on people -- everywhere you will find signatures of god.\nOne need not go to the temples and the churches to worship; god is available everywhere. It is not a question of finding an object to worship, the real thing is to find a heart which can worship. And you already have the heart. Wherever you bow down, that becomes the temple.\n(Her head is bent down so that it touches the namesheet she holds in her hands. When she lifts her head her face is tear-stained.) -- How long will you be here?\n(the translator) She wants to be forever here but she can only stay for three months.\nGood -- that will do.

consciousness and fifty per cent of unconsciousness, then you can rely
upon your consciousness because now there is a balance; the unconscious
cannot easily take over.</p><p>When there is sixty per cent of consciousness and only forty per cent
of unconsciousness, you can move with certainty in life. Somebody can
insult you and you will remain unaffected. When ninety per cent becomes
conscious and only ten per cent is left unconscious the first satori
happens, the first glimpse of reality. And in that ten per cent many
satoris happen; thousands of satoris can happen, but at least three are
absolutely necessary.</p><p>As that ten per cent is transformed into consciousness it is
transformed in three parts. The first part gives you the first satori,
the second part the second satori, and the third part gives you samadhi.
When one hundred per cent of your being is conscious we call it samadhi.
The very word 'samadhi' means that one has arrived at absolute
equanimity, at absolute equilibrium. Now nothing can disturb you, even
death cannot disturb you.</p><p>That is the goal of sannyas, to arrive at one hundred per cent
consciousness. At that moment one is a Christ, a Krishna, a Buddha, or
whatsoever name one wants to use. These are just names, but the real
thing is one hundred per cent consciousness. And it is possible;
everybody is born with the potential, we just have to work upon it to
change it. And that small piece of consciousness can be used to
transform the whole being into consciousness. It can become a triggering
point.</p><p>It is a small light but we can create more and more light through it.
It is just a small candle but more candles can be lit by it. A chain of
candles can be lit through it and your whole life becomes a festival of
light.</p><p>In India every year we celebrate one night, the festival of lights.
People burn thousands of candles and small lamps. The whole country
celebrates the festival of lights. That night is the night when
Mahavira, one of the greatest mystics ever, became enlightened. And it
is a very special night in that way because Mahavira is the only person
who became enlightened on the darkest night.</p><p>Buddha became enlightened on the full-moon night and Mahavira became
enlightened on the no-moon night. That is very significant, it is a very
rare phenomenon. Almost all enlightened people have become enlightened
either on a full-moon night or very close to it. Except for Mahavira I
have never come across another person who has become enlightened on the
darkest night. Hence we celebrate that night, the darkest night, as the
festival of lights.</p><p>But people have completely forgotten the significance; they go on
observing the festival as a ritual.</p><p>There are thousands who don't even connect it with Mahavir. There are
millions who don't even know the name of Mahavir or know that it has
anything to do with Mahavir..</p><p>But it shows one thing, that even if you are living in the darkest
night, there is a</p><p>possibility that it can be transformed into a festival of light. So
there is no need to feel hopeless -- even the darkest night has a dawn
to it.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on

is that which arises out of love.) One can serve without love, but then
that service has no spiritual dimension to it. It may be rooted either
in fear or in greed. For example, Christian missionaries go on serving
humanity. It is not out of love but out of the fear of hell and the
greed for heaven. They don't know what love is; their whole effort is to
attain to heavenly pleasures. It is sheer greed and lust and they are
also afraid of the pains and the agonies and the sufferings of hell.
They are using poor people, exploiting them for some gain in the other
world. But this is not true service. There are motives behind it.</p><p>The service is true only when it is unmotivated, and there is only
one thing which is unmotivated -- that is love. So unless service is
rooted in love it is false.</p><p>I teach love because I know if love arises in you, service will come
as a shadow of it. And then you will not serve for some reward, you will
serve because you enjoy it. Then there will be no end to your service,
then your service will be an end unto itself.</p><p>And the greatest bliss is when your means and your ends are one, when
they are not separated in time.</p><p>When whatsoever you are doing is an end unto itself, then there is
bliss.</p><p>Anand Vinito. A miserable person is never humble. He cannot afford to
be humble. He is so miserable that he has to hide it by projecting his
ego. He magnifies his ego to hide his misery, his poverty, his inner
emptiness. He goes on making the balloon of the ego bigger and bigger so
it hides everything. The miserable person cannot be humble -- even if he
tries to show humbleness, that will be just another way of proving his
superiority. That will be just another trip</p><p>of the ego, another number -- nothing else.</p><p>But the blissful person is naturally humble. There is no need for the
ego. We need the ego to hide our emptiness. The blissful person is so
full that there is no question of hiding anything; he can stand naked in
the sun. The blissful person has so much bliss in his being that ego
cannot have any appeal for him. What is there for the ego to give to the
blissful person? He has got everything -- more than he needs.</p><p>There is a Sufi story.…</p><p>A king had gone to hunt but he and his party got lost in the jungle.
They were all searching for the way back to the capital.</p><p>A blind mystic used to live in the jungle with one of his followers.
One man of the king's party came and said, "Hey, blind man, do you know
which is the way to the capital?" The mystic laughed and he said,
"Yes.</p><p>You are a soldier of the king, you must have come with his party. Go
this way and after one mile you will find the road to the capital."</p><p>The follower was very much mystified because he knew his master was
blind -- how did he come to know that this man was a soldier?</p><p>And then another man came. He said to the blind man, "Sir, can you
show me the way? I have got lost in this jungle." And the blind man
said, "Yes. You must be the prime minister. This is the way -- after one
mile you will find the road to the capital."</p><p>The follower was even more mystified, but he kept silent and he
waited. In the night, when they went to rest, he would ask the master
how he knew -- because certainly this man <em>looked</em> like he was
the prime minister.</p><p>And then the king himself came and he touched the feet of the mystic
and said, "Please show me the way." And he said, "Yes, I know -- you are
the king of this country. This is the way."</p><p>In the night, the follower asked the master, "This is the first time
that you have behaved strangely, not like a blind man. And every time
you were right -- how did you manage it?"</p><p>The mystic said, "There was nothing to manage. The soldier behaved
arrogantly</p><p>-- that simply shows he is a miserable person, he must be of the
lowest rank. The prime minister addressed me as "Sir". That simply shows
he belongs to a higher rank; he is a man of culture, education --
polished, rich. And the king touched my feet because he has nothing to
lose and he has no need to show his arrogance, his ego. It was a simple
inference, you need not be mystified," said the old man. "I cannot
see-you know that perfectly well -- but I just inferred that the man who
touches my feet and asks so politely must be the king. It was just a
coincidence that my inferences fitted well; I cannot see who is who, but
the way they were behaving showed something."</p><p>This story is beautiful: the most blissful person, the person who is
a king of the inner world, will be absolutely egoless. He will be
humble. Those who are beggars in their spiritual world are very
egoistic, they cannot be humble.</p><p>So remember, your name means bliss, humbleness. Bliss has to be the
foundation of all humbleness.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on

cultivate it. A cultivated humbleness is false. It is not humbleness --
it is all humbug! An uncultivated humbleness which comes as a fragrance
of bliss is beautiful, is real, is true. And only that which is true is
worth achieving. The false simply takes your time, your energy, and
gives you nothing -- it is a sheer wastage.</p><p>(The last sannyasin, a Japanese woman -- a doll-maker -- had wept as
she sat with the others awaiting her turn. Osho tells her that the
meaning of her new name and the direction of her new life is the path of
devotion.)</p><p>You don't need anything else!</p><p>There are three paths. One is of meditation, of awareness. The second
is of action, of serving god. And the third is of devotion, of just
loving god. The third</p><p>is your path. Just totally love existence because it is visible god.
Love the whole creation because everywhere is the signature of god. On
the trees, on the birds, on the animals, on people -- everywhere you
will find signatures of god.</p><p>One need not go to the temples and the churches to worship; god is
available everywhere. It is not a question of finding an object to
worship, the real thing is to find a heart which can worship. And you
already have the heart. Wherever you bow down, that becomes the
temple.</p><p>(Her head is bent down so that it touches the namesheet she holds in

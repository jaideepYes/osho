There is a constant hankering to be with the other, to be together. The lonely person is constantly asking for love.\nAsking simply means that he is not at ease with himself, he wants somebody else to be occupied with. And of course this kind of love is not true love.\nIf it is a need then there is a motive, if there is a need then it is businesslike. The\nother is being used as a commodity and the other is using you as a commodity; hence the continuous conflict between lovers.\nNobody wants to be reduced to a thing, nobody wants to be used as a moans. That is a humiliation, it is a great insult, it is disrespectful. But that's what lovers are doing, hence anger arises. They are constantly at each other's necks. Excuses may be different but the fundamental thing is that both are incapable of being alone. Out of that incapability they are trying to be together.\nBut if you cannot enjoy yourself in your aloneness you cannot enjoy yourself in togetherness either.\nHence meditation is a first stop towards love.\nAndy means courageous, and great courage is needed to do this miracle. It is almost a miracle. It is the greatest change that can ever happen to a man: transforming loneliness into aloneness, transforming the negative into the positive, transforming darkness into light. But it is not impossible -- difficult certainly, arduous certainly, an uphill task, but not impossible. All that is needed is courage to risk, to go into it.\nPeople are so afraid of being lonely that they never go into it, they never allow it to happen in its totality and that's why they go on missing. If they allow it to happen, if they penetrate into it, if they make it an adventure, an exploration, without any prejudgement about what it is ... because how can you make any judgement if you have not experienced it? So going with no notion, with no idea of what it is, but just entering into that space of aloneness, slowly slowly, one starts enjoying the beauty of it, because it is the most beautiful thing in existence.\nBut we are constantly running away from it in every possible way -- thinking, desiring, imagining, going into the past, going into the future, visiting people, going to the clubs, to the movies, sitting before that idiot box called television for hours together, just somehow not facing the reality of your aloneness. But one cannot avoid it. Death will bring it to you because everything will be taken away. And if you have not learned the art in life what are you going to do when death takes the television, the movie, clubs, lovers, everything away from you and leaves you alone? That's why people die in misery, otherwise death is the ultimate culmination of joy.\nIf you know how to enjoy your aloneness you have transformed death into something totally different.\nThen death will not come as a calamity, it will come as a blessing. The meditator dies rejoicing. There is dance inside his being because he already knows what it is to be alone, and what a beauty it is and what a benediction it is.\nCourage is a basic requirement to penetrate the innermost core of your aloneness. And once you have known the joy of being alone you can share it -- and that is love. Love is a fragrance of the flower of meditation. Without meditation is just an empty name, an empty word; it has no meaning, no content. It hides something else and not only something else but something totally opposite to love: it hides lust.\nSo this has to be the work of every sannyasin, this is the work, to go into your aloneness. Find moments 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nwhen you can be alone. There is no need to escape to a monastery or to the mountains; one can find a few hours every day. And the best thing is to find it in the world, amongst all kinds of distractions, because then nothing can destroy it.\nIf you find it in the Himalayas when you come back to the world it will be destroyed. It was something contributed by the Himalayas, it was not something that has grown in you. It was a gift of the Himalayan peace. It was just a reflection in you, it was not really yours at all.\nSo my insistence is that my sannyasins have to live in the world and yet work silently to create the space within themselves where the whole world disappears, where one becomes profoundly silent. Out of that arises love. And when meditation and love are both there you have achieved your destiny, you have fulfilled the task given to you by god. And then naturally there is great contentment, the joy that comes after reaching a peak.\nNow you can rest, now you are at home, now you are at peace with existence.\nNeither meditation alone is enough nor is love alone enough; both are two aspects of the same coin and for both courage is needed, but the basic thing is meditation.\nBegin with meditation and end in love. That defines the whole journey of sannyas.\n(Dhyan Angelika: only through meditation can truth be unearthed.) Truth is not a conclusion of logical thinking, it is a realisation of absolute silence. It is a realisation, not a conclusion. Truth is not something that you have to invent, truth is something that is already in your being; you have brought it with you.\nEverybody brings the truth hidden deep into one's being. It has not to be invented, it has only to be discovered. Whatsoever is invented is a lie, it cannot be true. Truth is already there, you just have to uncover it. And that's what meditation is all about: uncovering all layers. Particularly there are three thick layers and you have to penetrate those layers.\nThe first is the identity with the body -- we think we are our bodies. That's a wrong notion, it has to be broken. We are in the body but we are not the body. The body is a beautiful temple, but it is a temple and you have lived in many temples before. This is not the first time that you are in a body, you have lived in thousands of bodies. Bodies change but the traveller remains the same. You are a guest, the body is a host, but never become identified with the host.\nThe second layer is identification with the mind, with thinking. People think we are our minds -- that's why people become so much obsessed with ideologies. Somebody is a Christian and somebody is a Hindu and somebody is a Mohammedan, somebody is a Communist and they become so attached to these ideas that they are ready to kill or be killed for them. And these are only thoughts, just soap bubbles -- nothing much in them. You are not your mind, but people become very much identified with the mind -- and more so than with the body, because it is very rare that you have a really beautiful body.\nSo people are very rarely at ease with their bodies, but they are always at ease with their minds, for the simple reason that mind is not observed by others. Even if it carries many ugly things nobody can observe it. And even those ugly things you can keep to the back; you need not observe them yourself. That's how repression happens: people go on repressing whatsoever is not of their liking,\nthey go on throwing it in the basement of their mind and the basement has become so big, it is ninety per cent of your mind. Only ten per cent at the top you decorate with beautiful ideas, morality, mannerism, etiquette -- nice things. It is a decorative piece in a show window where you receive guests and welcome friends. But that is not your reality. That's why psychologists have to go into your dreams -- for the simple reason that your dreams show much more reality about you than your conscious mind. The conscious mind is arbitrary, artificial. It is managed for the simple purpose of exhibiting.\nIt is just as you make a beautiful drawing room in your house with paintings and chandeliers. And you keep it clean and do everything because you will be receiving people there. The rest of your house may be dirty -- who bothers about the house? -- but that shows more about you.\nWith the body very few people are at case because it is so obviously there that you cannot repress it.\nAnd women are more identified with their bodies than men because certainly they have more beautiful bodies. Men are not so much identified with the body, they are more identified with the mind. Women are not much interested in isms and ideologies; they think these are just foolish things.\nMen are very much interested in communism, in socialism, in fascism, in religions, in philosophies. The woman is much more interested in the mirror where she can see her body. And of course she takes more care of the body.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThe problem for a woman sannyasin is how to get unidentified with the body and the problem for a male sannyasin is how to get rid of the identity with the mind. But these are not absolute things. There are women who are more identified with the mind -- they must be ugly women. And there are men who are more identified with the body -- they must be stupid men, mediocre minds.\nSo this is just a general observation; I am not making a definite statement about it. This is not something universal. But whether you are identified with the mind or with the body, it makes no difference: identification is the problem.\nAnd there are a few people who are identified neither with the body nor with the mind but who are identified with their feelings -- the poets, the musicians, the painters, the artists. They are more identified with the heart, the so-called lovers ; that is the last citadel of identification.\nOne has to get out of all these three and then meditation happens. When you have gone beyond the three, when you know you are not the body, not the mind, not the heart, suddenly your being explodes. That is meditation: the whole process of destroying identifications. The moment there is nothing to be identified with, when your consciousness is just pure, unidentified, unadulterated, you have achieved meditation and in that moment truth is discovered.\nAngelika also means a messenger of god. Only a meditator can become a messenger of god because only a meditator can reveal truth, only a meditator can live truth. Only a meditator can radiate truth, nobody else -- not the philosophers, not the theologians but the mystic. One who has reached to the innermost core of his being, starts living his truth. And that truth radiates, it starts reaching others, it starts vibrating other peoples' beings. It creates a kind of synchronicity. If whosoever comes close to the person who has attained the truth is open, he will immediately feel a movement in the innermost soul. Something is triggered, music is heard, a light has penetrated. There is a communion -- and that communion is the whole purpose of sannyas.\nBy becoming a sannyasin you simply expose yourself to me. You withdraw all your resistance, you withdraw all your defences, you become available to me, vulnerable. And then something invisible starts functioning. Nobody will be able to see it.\nThere are many people, particularly journalists, who when they come to the ashram ask sannyasins\n'What is happening to you?' because they can see something is happening. And sannyasins say it cannot be said, it has to be felt. You have to be here and participate. But the journalist comes here to be an observer --\ndetached. He cannot participate because he is afraid that if he participates then he is no more a detached observer. So he has to be just a detached observer. Then there is trouble: he cannot understand what is happening. Then he invents things, saying that may be it is some kind of mesmerism, hypnotism, witchcraft, some black magic. Then he goes on inventing things because he can see that something is happening but he cannot analyse it. Rationally he cannot find what it is exactly. Whomsoever he asks invites him to participate and that he cannot do.\nEverybody says to him, 'Can't you feel the energy? Can't you feel the Buddhafield?' And he cannot feel it because he is closed. Then he goes away with invented stories -- all lies, but he is not lying intentionally.\nHe may not like to do any harm but that's what he really does, because he starts saying things, writing articles, books, spreading rumours that he was there but nothing happened to him so how can he believe all those people? And he is right in a way, nothing has happened to him, but he is wrong in his conclusion.\nIt is like carrying a radio with you without putting it on. You can go on carrying it, it will not catch any station. You have to put it on. You have to bring the needle to the exact position, to the right position where it will start catching a certain station. That's what sannyas is. It is turning yourself on and then trying to bring your needle into a deep attunement with me. Then suddenly the message starts penetrating you.\nThis cannot happen to detached observers, hence journalists are always going to be reporting something wrong. This is a process which they cannot become part of and hence, they cannot understand it. It becomes very elusive for them.\nBy becoming a sannyasin you start participating in my being. It needs a certain attunement, a certain silence on your part, a certain opening so that you are no more objecting, resisting, fighting, defending.\nThat's what I mean when I use the word 'surrender'. It is not surrendering your being, it is surrendering your defences, your resistances, it is surrendering your negativity. It is opening your doors to the sun, to the wind, to the rain. Then miracles are possible, and everybody is entitled to miracles.\nI simply feel pity for those people who come here as observers. It is good to be a detached observer if you go to a scientific lab, but this is not a scientific lab; it is\na subjective phenomenon. Here, only participants will know, others will miss the whole point.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\n(Another theme Osho has been emphasising this week is that of erasing the ego so one is a zero. Then you become a medium, a vehicle, a passage, he explains to Shunyo Reinhold.) You are no more, you have been left behind, far behind. That is the meaning of becoming a nothing, a no-thing, a zero: you have abandoned your ego. And in that very moment you are in for a great surprise: here you abandon your ego and something tremendously powerful starts flowing through you -- oceanic, vast, tremendous, immeasurable. It gives power to you but not to the ego. It gives you power but it is no more yours; it is divine, it is god's. It gives you wisdom but it does not come from any outer source -- from Christ, from Buddha, from Krishna, from the Koran, from the Bible, from the Veda -- no. It does not come from any outer source, it comes from the unknown and it comes through you. From the very rock bottom of your being it comes. It is like a fountain that suddenly erupts.\nIt is both power and wisdom. Of course, wisdom has to be powerful, but this power is not the ordinary power we are accustomed to. It is not power which is violent, it is power which is love, compassion. It is power which becomes service.\nIt is not the power of Alexander, it is the power of a Buddha. And it is not the wisdom of the professors and the priests, it is the wisdom of a Jesus, of a Krishna of a Mohammed.\nMohammed was absolutely illiterate, he could not even sign his name, but the Koran descended through him. The ways of god are very strange. He didn't choose some scholar -- and there were great scholars available, even in Mohammed's place there were great scholars, imams. But he chose Mohammed for the simple reason that this was the man who had abandoned his ego.\nIn Jesus' time there were great rabbis, very scholarly, great historians who knew all the scriptures, who could quote all the prophets of the past -- but god chose the son of a carpenter. He also was illiterate, uneducated, from a small village, and the village was very notorious; it was known that nothing good had ever happened. But god's ways are mysterious. He chose this carpenter's son for the simple reason that Jesus was capable of putting his ego aside.\nOne becomes god's chosen person if one can fulfil a simple requirement: just put the ego aside. Nothing else is needed. Then power flows through you, wisdom flows through you, love flows through you. You yourself become blissful and you become a blessing to the whole existence too.\nYogen means the art of meeting and merging with god. Yoga simply means meeting, merging.\nOrdinarily we are separate from the whole. We live like islands -- and that's the cause of our whole misery, because the more separate from existence we feel, the more alienated we become. And then of course we are outsiders and strangers and we don't see any significance, any meaning in life. Then everything is boring.\nSoren Kierkegaard, the founder of existentialism in the West, says that boredom is the most important problem. But it is an important problem only if you are living in a separate world of your own, a private world, alienated from existence, inimical to existence. Otherwise, Buddha says there is no question of boredom -- there is bliss, ecstasy.\nNow to whom to listen? Is Kierkegaard right -- that life is boredom? Or is Buddha right -- that life is infinite bliss? Both are telling their stories. Kierkegaard lived like an island, He was in absolute isolation, he never met people, he had no friends. He loved a woman and he wanted to marry her but at the last moment he escaped. At the last moment he rejected her for the simple reason that he was always afraid to be so close to somebody.\nThat closeness was creating a trembling in him. He never wanted anybody to look into his private world.\nHe was trying to hide his misery, he was not ready to share or expose himself to anybody, so he lived imprisoned in his own world. Naturally, he felt life was a boredom.\nAnd Buddha opened himself up to the stars, to the ocean, to the sky, to the trees, to the birds, and he knew life as bliss. It all depends on how you relate to existence. Are you trying to be an egoist? -- then misery, boredom, anguish is going to be your fate. If you meet and merge with existence, if you start destroying the walls and creating bridges... because the same bricks can be used: you can make a wall or you can make a bridge. If you start destroying the walls and making bridges, that is yoga. That is creating as many meeting points as possible -- a multi-dimensional unity with existence, with all its beauty, with all its celebration, with the millions of forms that life has taken.\nOne should be able to relate with trees, with rocks, with animals, with rivers, with mountains. One should be able to relate with the whole of life in all its forms. The more you relate, the more rich you are.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nAnd when your relationship becomes so deep that you don't feel an island, you become part of the vast continent that god is, then life is sheer ecstasy.\nThat is the meaning of your name. Bliss comes out of meeting, merging with the whole.\n(Natural or spontaneous love, is the meaning of her name, Osho tells the last person for sannyas.) We are brought up in such a way that we even forget how to be loving naturally, spontaneously. Even love -- the most significant value in life\n-- becomes something artificial. The mother says to the child 'Love me because I am your mother.' She does not allow the child to grow towards a spontaneous love. She enforces on the child the idea that he has to love, he must love. Now this is sheer stupidity.\nLove cannot be made a duty, and the moment you make it a duty it becomes artificial, superficial. Then it is not even skin deep. The father says 'Love me because I am your father.' They are giving reasons why the child should love them, as if love needs any reasons. They are not creating a situation around the\nchild in which the child spontaneously flowers into a loving person; they are enforcing the idea.\nIf the child does not feel love naturally he feels guilty -- because he is not loving the mother; the father, and this is bad, this is not how this should be. He starts feeling condemnation for himself. And if he tries to love just to avoid guilt then he knows that it is just hypocrisy, but he has to learn the hypocrisy because he has to survive. It is a question of life and death for him. Then he has to love the brothers and the sisters and the uncles and the aunts. He has to love and he completely forgets that love could have been a natural growth. Now it is a duty, a commandment to be fulfilled, so he goes on doing it. It becomes an empty gesture. And this becomes his pattern for the whole of his life.\nIn fact, the first seven years of life are the most important time. If the person is going to live seventy years then those first seven years are going to be decisive for seventy years because he will repeat the same pattern on different planes. He will pretend to love his wife, he will pretend to love his children, he will pretend to love the friends. And the pretension will go so deep that he will not even feel that this is a pretension; he will think this is what love is supposed to be. This is love. That's why everybody in the whole world is loving and the world is turning into a great madhouse. If everybody were loving the world would be a paradise, not a madhouse. People would be blissful -- if there is so much love in the world everybody should be flowering. Nobody seems to be flowering. Something very basic is missing.\nMy effort here is to help you become aware of all your pretensions. Once you are aware they can be dropped. They can be dropped very easily -- the whole thing is to become aware of them, They have gone deep, their roots have reached very deep into your bones, into your very marrow. So one has to be very alert, very aware, to find all the roots. Once you have found all the roots of your false, pseudo, love, you can uproot it. You can uproot all the weeds and you will become again a child and you will start your life afresh from the very beginning in innocence, and then there will be spontaneity, naturalness.\nAnd to be spontaneously loving, naturally loving, is to be religious. Religion has nothing to do with worshipping Jesus or Buddha or Krishna. It has nothing to do with chanting mantras, it has nothing to do with all kinds of rituals being done in the churches and the temples. It has nothing to do with all this nonsense. True religion is simply spontaneous love -- and the whole society has been against it.\nHence my sannyasins will be facing; many many challenges, but those challenges are beautiful; they can be transformed into opportunities.\nWhen you accept a challenge it gives you integrity, it gives you sharpness, it gives you intelligence. And every challenge becomes a new adventure. We have to use all challenges as stepping stones.\nBut remember one thing: until spontaneity of love is achieved life is going to be a sheer waste. People are born with great potential and they die like beggars; the potential remains unfulfilled, unrealised.\nMy sannyasins have to die as rich emperors, emperors of the inner world, that Jesus calls the kingdom of god. Love is the door to that kingdom of god -- but spontaneous love, natural love, not a love enforced by others but something that arises within you for no reason at all. Love for love's sake, then love has such beauty, such grace, such incomprehensible depth and such heights that the Himalayan peaks are nothing compared to it.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nI Am Not As Thunk As You Drink I Am Chapter #8\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"4421","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/i_am_not_as_thunk_as_you_drink_i_am/part6/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/i_am_not_as_thunk_as_you_drink_i_am/>I Am Not As Thunk As You Drink I Am</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>21 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;4421 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/I_Am_Not_As_Thunk_As_You_Drink_I_Am/part6.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part5>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

transforming loneliness into aloneness, solitariness into solitude.</p><p>Ordinarily you are not alone, you are lonely and of course loneliness
is a state of misery. There is a constant hankering to be with the
other, to be together. The lonely person is constantly asking for
love.</p><p>Asking simply means that he is not at ease with himself, he wants
somebody else to be occupied with. And of course this kind of love is
not true love.</p><p>If it is a need then there is a motive, if there is a need then it is
businesslike. The</p><p>other is being used as a commodity and the other is using you as a
commodity; hence the continuous conflict between lovers.</p><p>Nobody wants to be reduced to a thing, nobody wants to be used as a
moans. That is a humiliation, it is a great insult, it is disrespectful.
But that's what lovers are doing, hence anger arises. They are
constantly at each other's necks. Excuses may be different but the
fundamental thing is that both are incapable of being alone. Out of that
incapability they are trying to be together.</p><p>But if you cannot enjoy yourself in your aloneness you cannot enjoy
yourself in togetherness either.</p><p>Hence meditation is a first stop towards love.</p><p>Andy means courageous, and great courage is needed to do this
miracle. It <em>is</em> almost a miracle. It is the greatest change that
can ever happen to a man: transforming loneliness into aloneness,
transforming the negative into the positive, transforming darkness into
light. But it is not impossible -- difficult certainly, arduous
certainly, an uphill task, but not impossible. All that is needed is
courage to risk, to go into it.</p><p>People are so afraid of being lonely that they never go into it, they
never allow it to happen in its totality and that's why they go on
missing. If they allow it to happen, if they penetrate into it, if they
make it an adventure, an exploration, without any prejudgement about
what it is ... because how can you make any judgement if you have not
experienced it? So going with no notion, with no idea of what it is, but
just entering into that space of aloneness, slowly slowly, one starts
enjoying the beauty of it, because it is the most beautiful thing in
existence.</p><p>But we are constantly running away from it in every possible way --
thinking, desiring, imagining, going into the past, going into the
future, visiting people, going to the clubs, to the movies, sitting
before that idiot box called television for hours together, just somehow
not facing the reality of your aloneness. But one cannot avoid it. Death
will bring it to you because everything will be taken away. And if you
have not learned the art in life what are you going to do when death
takes the television, the movie, clubs, lovers, everything away from you
and leaves you alone? That's why people die in misery, otherwise death
is the ultimate culmination of joy.</p><p>If you know how to enjoy your aloneness you have transformed death
into something totally different.</p><p>Then death will not come as a calamity, it will come as a blessing.
The meditator dies rejoicing. There is dance inside his being because he
already knows what it is to be alone, and what a beauty it is and what a
benediction it is.</p><p>Courage is a basic requirement to penetrate the innermost core of
your aloneness. And once you have known the joy of being alone you can
share it -- and that is love. Love is a fragrance of the flower of
meditation. Without meditation is just an empty name, an empty word; it
has no meaning, no content. It hides something else and not only
something else but something totally opposite to love: it hides
lust.</p><p>So this has to be the work of every sannyasin, this is <em>the</em>
work, to go into your aloneness. Find moments 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on

to the mountains; one can find a few hours every day. And the best thing
is to find it <em>in</em> the world, amongst all kinds of distractions,
because then nothing can destroy it.</p><p>If you find it in the Himalayas when you come back to the world it
will be destroyed. It was something contributed by the Himalayas, it was
not something that has grown in you. It was a gift of the Himalayan
peace. It was just a reflection in you, it was not really yours at
all.</p><p>So my insistence is that my sannyasins have to live in the world and
yet work silently to create the space within themselves where the whole
world disappears, where one becomes profoundly silent. Out of that
arises love. And when meditation and love are both there you have
achieved your destiny, you have fulfilled the task given to you by god.
And then naturally there is great contentment, the joy that comes after
reaching a peak.</p><p>Now you can rest, now you are at home, now you are at peace with
existence.</p><p>Neither meditation alone is enough nor is love alone enough; both are
two aspects of the same coin and for both courage is needed, but the
basic thing is meditation.</p><p>Begin with meditation and end in love. That defines the whole journey
of sannyas.</p><p>(Dhyan Angelika: only through meditation can truth be unearthed.)
Truth is not a conclusion of logical thinking, it is a realisation of
absolute silence. It is a realisation, not a conclusion. Truth is not
something that you have to invent, truth is something that is already in
your being; you have brought it with you.</p><p>Everybody brings the truth hidden deep into one's being. It has not
to be invented, it has only to be discovered. Whatsoever is invented is
a lie, it cannot be true. Truth is already there, you just have to
uncover it. And that's what meditation is all about: uncovering all
layers. Particularly there are three thick layers and you have to
penetrate those layers.</p><p>The first is the identity with the body -- we think we are our
bodies. That's a wrong notion, it has to be broken. We <em>are</em> in
the body but we are not the body. The body is a beautiful temple, but it
is a temple and you have lived in many temples before. This is not the
first time that you are in a body, you have lived in thousands of
bodies. Bodies change but the traveller remains the same. You are a
guest, the body is a host, but never become identified with the
host.</p><p>The second layer is identification with the mind, with thinking.
People think we are our minds -- that's why people become so much
obsessed with ideologies. Somebody is a Christian and somebody is a
Hindu and somebody is a Mohammedan, somebody is a Communist and they
become so attached to these ideas that they are ready to kill or be
killed for them. And these are only thoughts, just soap bubbles --
nothing much in them. You are not your mind, but people become very much
identified with the mind -- and more so than with the body, because it
is very rare that you have a really beautiful body.</p><p>So people are very rarely at ease with their bodies, but they are
always at ease with their minds, for the simple reason that mind is not
observed by others. Even if it carries many ugly things nobody can
observe it. And even those ugly things you can keep to the back; you
need not observe them yourself. That's how repression happens: people go
on repressing whatsoever is not of their liking,</p><p>they go on throwing it in the basement of their mind and the basement
has become so big, it is ninety per cent of your mind. Only ten per cent
at the top you decorate with beautiful ideas, morality, mannerism,
etiquette -- nice things. It is a decorative piece in a show window
where you receive guests and welcome friends. But that is not your
reality. That's why psychologists have to go into your dreams -- for the
simple reason that your dreams show much more reality about you than
your conscious mind. The conscious mind is arbitrary, artificial. It is
managed for the simple purpose of exhibiting.</p><p>It is just as you make a beautiful drawing room in your house with
paintings and chandeliers. And you keep it clean and do everything
because you will be receiving people there. The rest of your house may
be dirty -- who bothers about the house? -- but that shows more about
you.</p><p>With the body very few people are at case because it is so obviously
there that you cannot repress it.</p><p>And women are more identified with their bodies than men because
certainly they have more beautiful bodies. Men are not so much
identified with the body, they are more identified with the mind. Women
are not much interested in isms and ideologies; they think these are
just foolish things.</p><p>Men are very much interested in communism, in socialism, in fascism,
in religions, in philosophies. The woman is much more interested in the
mirror where she can see her body. And of course she takes more care of
the body.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>The problem for a woman sannyasin is how to get unidentified with the
body and the problem for a male sannyasin is how to get rid of the
identity with the mind. But these are not absolute things. There are
women who are more identified with the mind -- they must be ugly women.
And there are men who are more identified with the body -- they must be
stupid men, mediocre minds.</p><p>So this is just a general observation; I am not making a definite
statement about it. This is not something universal. But whether you are
identified with the mind or with the body, it makes no difference:
identification is the problem.</p><p>And there are a few people who are identified neither with the body
nor with the mind but who are identified with their feelings -- the
poets, the musicians, the painters, the artists. They are more
identified with the heart, the so-called lovers ; that is the last
citadel of identification.</p><p>One has to get out of all these three and then meditation happens.
When you have gone beyond the three, when you know you are not the body,
not the mind, not the heart, suddenly your being explodes. That is
meditation: the whole process of destroying identifications. The moment
there is nothing to be identified with, when your consciousness is just
pure, unidentified, unadulterated, you have achieved meditation and in
that moment truth is discovered.</p><p>Angelika also means a messenger of god. Only a meditator can become a
messenger of god because only a meditator can reveal truth, only a
meditator can live truth. Only a meditator can radiate truth, nobody
else -- not the philosophers, not the theologians but the mystic. One
who has reached to the innermost core of his being, starts living his
truth. And that truth radiates, it starts reaching others, it starts
vibrating other peoples' beings. It creates a kind of synchronicity. If
whosoever comes close to the person who has attained the truth is open,
he will immediately feel a movement in the innermost soul. Something is
triggered, music is heard, a light has penetrated. There is a communion
-- and that communion is the whole purpose of sannyas.</p><p>By becoming a sannyasin you simply expose yourself to me. You
withdraw all your resistance, you withdraw all your defences, you become
available to me, vulnerable. And then something invisible starts
functioning. Nobody will be able to see it.</p><p>There are many people, particularly journalists, who when they come
to the ashram ask sannyasins</p><p>'What is happening to you?' because they can see something is
happening. And sannyasins say it cannot be said, it has to be felt. You
have to be here and participate. But the journalist comes here to be an
observer --</p><p>detached. He cannot participate because he is afraid that if he
participates then he is no more a detached observer. So he has to be
just a detached observer. Then there is trouble: he cannot understand
what is happening. Then he invents things, saying that may be it is some
kind of mesmerism, hypnotism, witchcraft, some black magic. Then he goes
on inventing things because he can see that something is happening but
he cannot analyse it. Rationally he cannot find what it is exactly.
Whomsoever he asks invites him to participate and that he cannot do.</p><p>Everybody says to him, 'Can't you feel the energy? Can't you feel the
Buddhafield?' And he cannot feel it because he is closed. Then he goes
away with invented stories -- all lies, but he is not lying
intentionally.</p><p>He may not like to do any harm but that's what he really does,
because he starts saying things, writing articles, books, spreading
rumours that he was there but nothing happened to him so how can he
believe all those people? And he is right in a way, nothing has happened
to him, but he is wrong in his conclusion.</p><p>It is like carrying a radio with you without putting it on. You can
go on carrying it, it will not catch any station. You have to put it on.
You have to bring the needle to the exact position, to the right
position where it will start catching a certain station. That's what
sannyas is. It is turning yourself on and then trying to bring your
needle into a deep attunement with me. Then suddenly the message starts
penetrating you.</p><p>This cannot happen to detached observers, hence journalists are
always going to be reporting something wrong. This is a process which
they cannot become part of and hence, they cannot understand it. It
becomes very elusive for them.</p><p>By becoming a sannyasin you start participating in my being. It needs
a certain attunement, a certain silence on your part, a certain opening
so that you are no more objecting, resisting, fighting, defending.</p><p>That's what I mean when I use the word 'surrender'. It is not
surrendering your being, it is surrendering your defences, your
resistances, it is surrendering your negativity. It is opening your
doors to the sun, to the wind, to the rain. Then miracles are possible,
and everybody is entitled to miracles.</p><p>I simply feel pity for those people who come here as observers. It is
good to be a detached observer if you go to a scientific lab, but this
is not a scientific lab; it is</p><p>a subjective phenomenon. Here, only participants will know, others
will miss the whole point.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>(Another theme Osho has been emphasising this week is that of erasing
the ego so one is a zero. Then you become a medium, a vehicle, a
passage, he explains to Shunyo Reinhold.) You are no more, you have been
left behind, far behind. That is the meaning of becoming a nothing, a
no-thing, a zero: you have abandoned your ego. And in that very moment
you are in for a great surprise: here you abandon your ego and something
tremendously powerful starts flowing through you -- oceanic, vast,
tremendous, immeasurable. It gives power to you but not to the ego. It
gives you power but it is no more yours; it is divine, it is god's. It
gives you wisdom but it does not come from any outer source -- from
Christ, from Buddha, from Krishna, from the Koran, from the Bible, from
the Veda -- no. It does not come from any outer source, it comes from
the unknown and it comes through you. From the very rock bottom of your
being it comes. It is like a fountain that suddenly erupts.</p><p>It is both power and wisdom. Of course, wisdom has to be powerful,
but this power is not the ordinary power we are accustomed to. It is not
power which is violent, it is power which is love, compassion. It is
power which becomes service.</p><p>It is not the power of Alexander, it is the power of a Buddha. And it
is not the wisdom of the professors and the priests, it is the wisdom of
a Jesus, of a Krishna of a Mohammed.</p><p>Mohammed was absolutely illiterate, he could not even sign his name,
but the Koran descended through him. The ways of god are very strange.
He didn't choose some scholar -- and there were great scholars
available, even in Mohammed's place there were great scholars, imams.
But he chose Mohammed for the simple reason that this was the man who
had abandoned his ego.</p><p>In Jesus' time there were great rabbis, very scholarly, great
historians who knew all the scriptures, who could quote all the prophets
of the past -- but god chose the son of a carpenter. He also was
illiterate, uneducated, from a small village, and the village was very
notorious; it was known that nothing good had ever happened. But god's
ways are mysterious. He chose this carpenter's son for the simple reason
that Jesus was capable of putting his ego aside.</p><p>One becomes god's chosen person if one can fulfil a simple
requirement: just put the ego aside. Nothing else is needed. Then power
flows through you, wisdom flows through you, love flows through you. You
yourself become blissful and you become a blessing to the whole
existence too.</p><p>Yogen means the art of meeting and merging with god. Yoga simply
means meeting, merging.</p><p>Ordinarily we are separate from the whole. We live like islands --
and that's the cause of our whole misery, because the more separate from
existence we feel, the more alienated we become. And then of course we
are outsiders and strangers and we don't see any significance, any
meaning in life. Then everything is boring.</p><p>Soren Kierkegaard, the founder of existentialism in the West, says
that boredom is the most important problem. But it is an important
problem only if you are living in a separate world of your own, a
private world, alienated from existence, inimical to existence.
Otherwise, Buddha says there is no question of boredom -- there is
bliss, ecstasy.</p><p>Now to whom to listen? Is Kierkegaard right -- that life is boredom?
Or is Buddha right -- that life is infinite bliss? Both are telling
<em>their</em> stories. Kierkegaard lived like an island, He was in
absolute isolation, he never met people, he had no friends. He loved a
woman and he wanted to marry her but at the last moment he escaped. At
the last moment he rejected her for the simple reason that he was always
afraid to be so close to somebody.</p><p>That closeness was creating a trembling in him. He never wanted
anybody to look into his private world.</p><p>He was trying to hide his misery, he was not ready to share or expose
himself to anybody, so he lived imprisoned in his own world. Naturally,
he felt life was a boredom.</p><p>And Buddha opened himself up to the stars, to the ocean, to the sky,
to the trees, to the birds, and he knew life as bliss. It all depends on
how you relate to existence. Are you trying to be an egoist? -- then
misery, boredom, anguish is going to be your fate. If you meet and merge
with existence, if you start destroying the walls and creating
bridges... because the same bricks can be used: you can make a wall or
you can make a bridge. If you start destroying the walls and making
bridges, that is yoga. That is creating as many meeting points as
possible -- a multi-dimensional unity with existence, with all its
beauty, with all its celebration, with the millions of forms that life
has taken.</p><p>One should be able to relate with trees, with rocks, with animals,
with rivers, with mountains. One should be able to relate with the whole
of life in all its forms. The more you relate, the more rich you
are.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-4>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>And when your relationship becomes so deep that you don't feel an
island, you become part of the vast continent that god is, then life is
sheer ecstasy.</p><p>That is the meaning of your name. Bliss comes out of meeting, merging
with the whole.</p><p>(Natural or spontaneous love, is the meaning of her name, Osho tells
the last person for sannyas.) We are brought up in such a way that we
even forget how to be loving naturally, spontaneously. Even love -- the
most significant value in life</p><p>-- becomes something artificial. The mother says to the child 'Love
me because I am your mother.' She does not allow the child to grow
towards a spontaneous love. She enforces on the child the idea that he
<em>has</em> to love, he <em>must</em> love. Now this is sheer
stupidity.</p><p>Love cannot be made a duty, and the moment you make it a duty it
becomes artificial, superficial. Then it is not even skin deep. The
father says 'Love me because I am your father.' They are giving reasons
why the child should love them, as if love needs any reasons. They are
not creating a situation around the</p><p>child in which the child spontaneously flowers into a loving person;
they are enforcing the idea.</p><p>If the child does not feel love naturally he feels guilty -- because
he is not loving the mother; the father, and this is bad, this is not
how this should be. He starts feeling condemnation for himself. And if
he tries to love just to avoid guilt then he knows that it is just
hypocrisy, but he has to learn the hypocrisy because he has to survive.
It is a question of life and death for him. Then he has to love the
brothers and the sisters and the uncles and the aunts. He <em>has</em>
to love and he completely forgets that love could have been a natural
growth. Now it is a duty, a commandment to be fulfilled, so he goes on
doing it. It becomes an empty gesture. And this becomes his pattern for
the whole of his life.</p><p>In fact, the first seven years of life are the most important time.
If the person is going to live seventy years then those first seven
years are going to be decisive for seventy years because he will repeat
the same pattern on different planes. He will pretend to love his wife,
he will pretend to love his children, he will pretend to love the
friends. And the pretension will go so deep that he will not even feel
that this is a pretension; he will think this is what love is supposed
to be. This is love. That's why everybody in the whole world is loving
and the world is turning into a great madhouse. If everybody were loving
the world would be a paradise, not a madhouse. People would be blissful
-- if there is so much love in the world everybody should be flowering.
Nobody seems to be flowering. Something very basic is missing.</p><p>My effort here is to help you become aware of all your pretensions.
Once you are aware they can be dropped. They can be dropped very easily
-- the whole thing is to become aware of them, They have gone deep,
their roots have reached very deep into your bones, into your very
marrow. So one has to be very alert, very aware, to find all the roots.
Once you have found all the roots of your false, pseudo, love, you can
uproot it. You can uproot all the weeds and you will become again a
child and you will start your life afresh from the very beginning in
innocence, and then there will be spontaneity, naturalness.</p><p>And to be spontaneously loving, naturally loving, is to be religious.
Religion has nothing to do with worshipping Jesus or Buddha or Krishna.
It has nothing to do with chanting mantras, it has nothing to do with
all kinds of rituals being done in the churches and the temples. It has
nothing to do with all this nonsense. True religion is simply
spontaneous love -- and the whole society has been against it.</p><p>Hence my sannyasins will be facing; many many challenges, but those
challenges are beautiful; they can be transformed into
opportunities.</p><p>When you accept a challenge it gives you integrity, it gives you
sharpness, it gives you intelligence. And every challenge becomes a new
adventure. We have to use all challenges as stepping stones.</p><p>But remember one thing: until spontaneity of love is achieved life is
going to be a sheer waste. People are born with great potential and they
die like beggars; the potential remains unfulfilled, unrealised.</p><p>My sannyasins have to die as rich emperors, emperors of the inner
world, that Jesus calls the kingdom of god. Love is the door to that
kingdom of god -- but spontaneous love, natural love, not a love
enforced by others but something that arises within you for no reason at
all. Love for love's sake, then love has such beauty, such grace, such
incomprehensible depth and such heights that the Himalayan peaks are
nothing compared to it.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-5>Osho's books on

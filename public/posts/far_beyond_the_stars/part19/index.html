It means divine star. Tar means star, mm? – the english word ‘star’ comes from the sanskrit root ‘tara’. In sanskrit it is ‘sitara’; from sitara it has become tara in Hindi and star in English. But tara is also the name of a tantra goddess.\nThere are two traditions of tantra – one is Hindu, another is Buddhist. In the Buddhist tradition tara is the name of the tantra goddess. And every Buddhist tantrika has to practise the idea of the goddess with the beloved.\nWhen a tantra worshipper is making love to his woman, first, for months he has to visualise the woman as being the goddess Tara. By and by the visualisation becomes settled; by and by he completely forgets that she is a human being. When she is no more a human being, only then is love allowed, not before it. The master goes on watching, the master has to observe, and until the moment that the master allows them to move into love-making they are to remain celibates because before that moment it will not be love; it will be simply lust.\nSo every day for hours the practitioner will sit in front of the woman. The woman will be on a high pedestal, sitting naked, nude, and he will simply sit and look at her for hours together and imagine – in the beginning it is imagination, visualisation – that she is divine, that she is not his woman, that she is the mother-goddess Tara.\nAnd by and by, months, sometimes years pass, by and by the body is no more human – it is no more made of bones and skin and blood; it starts becoming golden.\nIn fact it is so; the visualisation does not create a projection – it simply helps you to see the reality as it is. It simply helps you to drop the concept, the hypnotic concept, that the body consists only of the physical. Once you are helped through imagination this body no more really seems relevant; there is another body hidden behind it that starts being realised.\nAnd this happens not only to the man: the woman is also continuously meditating on the same phenomenon – that she is no more a human being, that she is no more a woman and the man in front of her is no more a lover but a child and she a mother-goddess.\nThey both go on creating this harmony; one day it happens and it happens together – to both of them. That’s the beauty of it, it synchronises: when it happens, it happens to both. And then there is no doubt about it. It is not that the man is still uncertain as to whether it is his imagination – if he is uncertain, it has not happened. When it really happens there is no uncertainty, no doubt – it is one hundred percent so. And suddenly both become divine; it is a transfiguration. In that moment one can see their auras meeting, and the master then allows them: now they can move in love. Now there will really be love, no lust, it is no more sex. It is something divine, something of samadhi.\nSo that too, is the name Tara, mm.…\n[The couple as about their marriage. They’re both feeling fond of each other but there is no sexual attraction now. Osho says this is perfectly natural and understandable. Sex is the desire to explore the other; once his or her territory is known sex is finished. Then one looks around for the new, the unfamiliar, the uncharted. Osho suggests that at this stage in their relationship a new element can arise – of friendship. He advises the two remain together as friends, allowing each other the freedom to have lovers if they want.]\nDeva means divine and sugatta is one of the names of Buddha; it means well-gone. ‘Gatta’ means gone, ‘su’ means well. The english word ‘go’ comes from the same ‘gatta’.\nAnd it means one who has gone so perfectly that he will not be coming back again – that’s the meaning: so well gone that he has not left any roots in the world.no desires left, no clinging left,\nno mind left, so there is no possibility of his coming back.\nHence Buddha has been called sugatta, and everybody has to become that. Because this world is misery – it is ‘dukkha’ – it is pain, it is suffering, and it is a vicious circle. One suffering creates another and that creates still another: it goes on moving like a wheel and we are caught in the wheel\n.\nYou can change from one spoke to another, that will not make any difference because the wheel is the same and it goes on moving. One has to jump out of the wheel then one becomes sugatta – well-gone; one will not be coming back. The day Buddha became enlightened he looked at the sky, laughed loudly and said, ‘Builder of the houses, now you will not need to build any more houses for me – I am finished!’ That was his first statement: ‘Builder of the houses, you will not need to build any more houses for me. I am finished with the world, I am not coming any more.’\nThese bodies are our houses into which we come and Buddha is saying that now there will be no need to create any more bodies for him – he has destroyed all his desire to live; the lust for life has disappeared utterly.\nThat is the meaning of sugatta – so get into tune with it!\n[A sannyasin couple have returned from running a centre in the West. They say that they learned a lot from the experience: We became very unaware and we can see it now. A lot of things dropped once we came here... so it has been a teaching.]\nLiving is always a teaching, and living together with somebody in love is a great teaching. The greatest teacher you can find in the world is love: it teaches you sometimes very painfully and sometimes very pleasantly. Sometimes the journey is just beautiful and sometimes very rough, but it teaches you all the same in all the ways, and both ways are needed.\nBut it is good – you are back; now many more things will happen. [The woman says: I don’t want to leave you again!]\nThere is no need! You wanted to go so you went, mm? If you had asked me I would have said don’t go but you wanted to go. But it was needed, otherwise it would have remained in the mind to go. Now it is good... there is no need to go.\n[She then says that she and her partner have decided to live separately but she cannot imagine not having a sexual relationship with him.]\nMm, there is no need to imagine it right now – when it happens it happens! Right now there is no need even to imagine it and there is no need to create it; when it happens, it happens. Wherever you are, in whatsoever space, be happy there. It is very good.…\nIf you can be very very independent of each other there will be more possibility of love, because when you are independent, when you are no more in any need of being dependent and keeping the other dependent, then all diplomacy drops.\nAnd really only two independent persons can love. Dependent persons hate each other; how can they love? You can never love somebody you are dependent upon. If you think your happiness is dependent on him you will never be able to forgive him because he is exploiting you: he is the master and your happiness depends on him. And if he feels that you keep the key of his happiness how can he forgive you? It is impossible to.\nWhen both are independent and happy on their own and out of happiness both sometimes meet and are together, then love really flowers. Then it has no smoke around it, no jealousy, nothing of that kind of poison; the flame is pure.\nSo this is the space right now – you need not imagine anything else, mm ? That will also happen some day when there is no need to imagine it. And one should not jump ahead, never, because that creates problems. Move slowly, move with your pace, and never make any ideals. Never be afraid of anything because there is nothing to be afraid of. Life belongs only to those who are utterly unafraid to accept whatsoever it brings.\nTake it as a gift, be thankful, enjoy it, celebrate it, and when some other gift comes enjoy that too. Sometimes you may not be even able to understand that this is a gift, sometimes it looks like a curse, but life never gives anything except gifts. It is your misunderstanding.\nLife always gives you blessings; how can it curse you? We belong to it, we are part of it: in being cursed, life will be cursed. It is impossible for life to curse anybody, it always comes as a blessing, but our understandings are tiny, our expectations are many, and if it goes against our expectations we think it is a curse. But all your expectations are not good for you, so who knows?\nFinally, when one becomes more and more mature, one starts looking back-wards, looks retrospectively, and then one is simply surprised that everything was as it should be: there had never been any curse... all was a blessing.\nMuch more is going to happen, mm? Good!\n[A sannyasin says she thinks it is time to go inside and stop depending on external things to make her happy. She asks what she can do to help this.]\nThis is a great insight that has happened to you – now keep to it! Don’t forget it the moment you go out of Lao Tzu house, mm?\nJust one thing – don’t forget it; just remember, that’s all. It is such a simple phenomenon if you can remember one thing – that in life nobody else can make you happy or comfortable or anything; it is not possible. That gift can be given only by yourself to you, nobody can give it to you. And because people go on begging from others, they suffer, because.…\nAnd those others are not really doing any harm. They cannot give and you cannot receive it, that is not the way to get it. You go on begging and they go on pretending that they are going to give. They cannot give and you cannot get; then there is frustration and anger, rage, madness and then thingsThen you start again begging somewhere else with somebody else but you do the same\nthing again.\nAgain the same thing will be repeated; it is the same story played on different stages with different peoplebut it is the same story, not an iota is different. Again you will have the same illusion – that\n[your partner], has failed, now [another lover] will give you happiness; now the right man has come.\nIf you want to learn this illusion you can go and make Divya your master. Every week she finds a man and she writes a letter, ‘Osho, this time I have found the real man! Incredible! It has never happened before and it is happening now!’\nShe forgets that she writes every week, and every week it is a different man. Again, within three, four days, it is gone, and then she forgets about that man, that incredible man. Again it is happening and it has never happened like this before and this time she would like to remain with this man forever and forever... and she forgets! The miracle is that she forgets that it is the same letter she writes once or twice every week. You can ask her if you want to create this illusion – then she is the master, Divya.\nThen drop it and just remember: don’t ask for any happiness from anybody – nobody can give it. Only you can give that gift to yourself, it is a self-gift.\nSo give that gift to yourself and be happy! When you are happyI am not saying not to relate with\npeople but now you relate from a totally different dimension: you relate from happiness. Now you\nrelate from unhappiness, you relate like a beggar. Begin to relate like an empress or emperor: you are not seeking anything from anybody, you are sharing.\nWhen love is not a seeking and not a need but a sharing, it has tremendous beauty. Then nobody is worried about whether it is going to last forever or not – why? If it is there only for this moment it is perfectly good – one shares. If tomorrow you meet again with the man and he is ready to meet you, you share again, otherwise good-bye! You thank him because there was a moment when you shared and it was a happy moment; you don’t want to make it a permanent thing. The idea of making something permanent arises only because you are in need. You are afraid: this man has given you happiness; tomorrow, if he says no – then you will be again unhappy. So make arrangements that tomorrow he cannot escape: lock the door! Once the door is locked that energy is no more there, even in this moment, because love happens only in freedom.\nOnce the door is locked, once the man starts feeling that he has been caught, once the woman starts feeling she has been caught, finished! Now, it may take years for them to recognise the fact, but it is finished right now! It depends: if you are very stupid it will take many years; if you are intelligent a few months; if you are very very intelligent a few days. If you are really alert this very moment you will be able to see that you have killed it. The child is no more alive, it is a corpse, because you tried to possess it.\nAnd why does one want to possess? The reason is because you think: ‘Who is going to provide for me tomorrow? This man has provided happiness for me today.’ The moment you recognise that this man has not done anything, you have given a gift to yourself. Then there is no fear; tomorrow again you can give it to yourself. Sometimes you can give it together with somebody, sometimes you can give it when you are alone. Nobody is giving it to you, it is only you giving it to yourself.\nSometimes we give indirectly: we give the gift to the person and then he gives it back to you. He gives a gift which is really for himself, to you and you give it back to him. This is just via the other but it is your gift that you give yourself.\nOnce this is understood then there is no need to go such a long route – a short circuit. You can simply give the gift from one hand to the other hand and you are as happy as you are with anybody else: alone you are happy.\nSo just remember it; nothing else has to be done. When you next start creating the illusion again, remember about Divya... and relax! I am not saying to become a nun, I am not saying that. I am saying to become an individual, not a nun. Become an individual. Love out of joy but not out of need. Love not as a beggar, love because you have too much and you would like to share with somebody. Don’t try to hold anybody and don’t try to cling, otherwise this will happen again and again. Then you will have many loves in your life and many lovers.\nSometimes such an individual person, such a free person who is capable of giving happiness to himself, such a person can love the same person for many years but each time it is a new love affair because he does not connect it in time; he does not think of the morrow. Today he is finished with today.\nSuch a person goes to bed and he has finished with this world, this world of today. Tomorrow morning he will rise again into another world. Even if the person is the same, for such an individual\nshe is not the same. So maybe the person is the same or maybe the person is not the same, it doesn’t make any difference: a man who is happy goes on loving; a woman who is happy goes on loving.\nAnd don’t ask anything out of love. It is good that one loves... in loving, one is blissful. Thank the other that he accepted; thank the other that he danced with you for a moment, sang with you for a moment, and then be finished. No need to prolong it, no need to say ‘What about tomorrow? What about the day after tomorrow?’\nDon’t bring in the future – remain free. Tomorrow is going to bring its own joys. Why make a repetition of today? Who knows? – better joys are waiting for you tomorrow.\nSo be thrilled with the future but without any expectation... with no hope, with no demand, just a thrill. The new is going to happen, the new is bound to happen!\nVery good... the insight is good, but I am afraid – will you be able to keep it? That’s the problem. Try to keep it. Whenever you start slipping out of it you Can just ask for a silent darshan, mm? and sit here. The moment you see me you will remember, mm? Good!\n[A sannyasin says: I’ve become a sannyasin... after fifteen months!]\nThat’s very good! It is early – people take fifteen lives! Fifteen months is fast.… Very good! Whenever you really become a sannyasin it is always early, mm? because sometimes it happens after thousands of lives. One never becomes mature enough to understand what life is, mature enough to rejoice in it... mature enough to go with it whole-heartedly wherever it leads, and strong enough to surrender!\nIt is not the weak who surrender, the weak cannot surrender: they are so afraid of their weakness. They protect themselves, how can they surrender? They defend themselves, how can they surrender? It is only the very very strong people who are capable of surrendering – because they are not afraid!\nAnd when one surrenders one becomes a sannyasin. It is a surrender, an utter surrender ro life, and a trust... a trust which needs and knows no conditions, an unconditional trust. Good.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"3195","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/far_beyond_the_stars/part19/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/far_beyond_the_stars/>Far Beyond the Stars</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">19 Happiness is a gift that only you can give to yourself</h1><div class=post-meta>15 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;3195 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Far_Beyond_the_Stars/part19.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part18>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

other; once his or her territory is known sex is finished. Then one
looks around for the new, the unfamiliar, the uncharted. Osho suggests
that at this stage in their relationship a new element can arise – of
friendship. He advises the two remain together as friends, allowing each
other the freedom to have lovers if they want.<span class=s3></span>]</p><p><br></p><p>Deva means divine and sugatta is one of the names of Buddha; it means
well-gone. ‘Gatta’ means gone, ‘su’ means well. The english word ‘go’
comes from the same ‘gatta’.</p><p><br></p><p>And it means one who has gone so perfectly that he will not be coming
back again – that’s the meaning: so well gone that he has not left any
roots in the world.<span class=s3></span>no desires left, no clinging
left,</p><p>no mind left, so there is no possibility of his coming back.</p><p><br></p><p>Hence Buddha has been called sugatta, and everybody has to become
that. Because this world is misery – it is ‘dukkha’ – it is pain, it is
suffering, and it is a vicious circle. One suffering creates another and
that creates still another: it goes on moving like a wheel and we are
caught in the wheel</p><p>.</p><p><br></p><p>You can change from one spoke to another, that will not make any
difference because the wheel is the same and it goes on moving. One has
to jump out of the wheel then one becomes sugatta – well-gone; one will
not be coming back. The day Buddha became enlightened he looked at the
sky, laughed loudly and said, ‘Builder of the houses, now you will not
need to build any more houses for me – I am finished!’ That was his
first statement: ‘Builder of the houses, you will not need to build any
more houses for me. I am finished with the world, I am not coming any
more.’</p><p><br></p><p>These bodies are our houses into which we come and Buddha is saying
that now there will be no need to create any more bodies for him – he
has destroyed all his desire to live; the lust for life has disappeared
utterly.</p><p><br></p><p>That is the meaning of sugatta – so get into tune with it!</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin couple have returned from running a centre in the West.
They say that they learned a lot from the experience: We became very
unaware and we can see it now. A lot of things dropped once we came
here... so it has been a teaching.]</p><p><br></p><p>Living is always a teaching, and living together with somebody in
love is a great teaching. The greatest teacher you can find in the world
is love: it teaches you sometimes very painfully and sometimes very
pleasantly. Sometimes the journey is just beautiful and sometimes very
rough, but it teaches you all the same in all the ways, and both ways
are needed.</p><p>But it is good – you are back; now many more things will happen. [The
woman says: I don’t want to leave you again!]</p><p>There is no need! You wanted to go so you went, mm? If you had asked
me I would have said don’t go but you wanted to go. But it was needed,
otherwise it would have remained in the mind to go. Now it is good...
there is no need to go.</p><p>[She then says that she and her partner have decided to live
separately but she cannot imagine not having a sexual relationship with
him.]</p><p><br></p><p>Mm, there is no need to imagine it right now – when it happens it
happens! Right now there is no need even to imagine it and there is no
need to create it; when it happens, it happens. Wherever you are, in
whatsoever space, be happy there. It is very good.…</p><p><br></p><p>If you can be very very independent of each other there will be more
possibility of love, because when you are independent, when you are no
more in any need of being dependent and keeping the other dependent,
then all diplomacy drops.</p><p><br></p><p>And really only two independent persons can love. Dependent persons
hate each other; how can they love? You can never love somebody you are
dependent upon. If you think your happiness is dependent on him you will
never be able to forgive him because he is exploiting you: he is the
master and your happiness depends on him. And if he feels that you keep
the key of his happiness how can he forgive you? It is impossible
to.</p><p>When both are independent and happy on their own and out of happiness
both sometimes meet and are together, then love really flowers. Then it
has no smoke around it, no jealousy, nothing of that kind of poison; the
flame is pure.</p><p><br></p><p>So this is the space right now – you need not imagine anything else,
mm ? That will also happen some day when there is no need to imagine it.
And one should not jump ahead, never, because that creates problems.
Move slowly, move with your pace, and never make any ideals. Never be
afraid of anything because there is nothing to be afraid of. Life
belongs only to those who are utterly unafraid to accept whatsoever it
brings.</p><p>Take it as a gift, be thankful, enjoy it, celebrate it, and when some
other gift comes enjoy that too. Sometimes you may not be even able to
understand that this is a gift, sometimes it looks like a curse, but
life never gives anything except gifts. It is your misunderstanding.</p><p><br></p><p>Life always gives you blessings; how can it curse you? We belong to
it, we are part of it: in being cursed, life will be cursed. It is
impossible for life to curse anybody, it always comes as a blessing, but
our understandings are tiny, our expectations are many, and if it goes
against our expectations we think it is a curse. But all your
expectations are not good for you, so who knows?</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, when one becomes more and more mature, one starts looking
back-wards, looks retrospectively, and then one is simply surprised that
everything was as it should be: there had never been any curse... all
was a blessing.</p><p><br></p><p>Much more is going to happen, mm? Good!</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin says she thinks it is time to go inside and stop
depending on external things to make her happy. She asks what she can do
to help this.]</p><p><br></p><p>This is a great insight that has happened to you – now keep to it!
Don’t forget it the moment you go out of Lao Tzu house, mm?</p><p><br></p><p>Just one thing – don’t forget it; just remember, that’s all. It is
such a simple phenomenon if you can remember one thing – that in life
nobody else can make you happy or comfortable or anything; it is not
possible. That gift can be given only by yourself to you, nobody can
give it to you. And because people go on begging from others, they
suffer, because.…</p><p><br></p><p>And those others are not really doing any harm. They cannot give and
you cannot receive it, that is not the way to get it. You go on begging
and they go on pretending that they are going to give. They cannot give
and you cannot get; then there is frustration and anger, rage, madness
and then things<span class=s3></span>Then you start again begging
somewhere else with somebody else but you do the same</p><p>thing again.</p><p><br></p><p>Again the same thing will be repeated; it is the same story played on
different stages with different people<span class=s3></span>but it is
the same story, not an iota is different. Again you will have the same
illusion – that</p><p>[your partner], has failed, now [another lover] will give you
happiness; now the right man has come.</p><p><br></p><p>If you want to learn this illusion you can go and make Divya your
master. Every week she finds a man and she writes a letter, ‘Osho, this
time I have found the real man! Incredible! It has never happened before
and it is happening now!’</p><p><br></p><p>She forgets that she writes every week, and every week it is a
different man. Again, within three, four days, it is gone, and then she
forgets about that man, that incredible man. Again it is happening and
it has never happened like this before and this time she would like to
remain with this man forever and forever... and she forgets! The miracle
is that she forgets that it is the same letter she writes once or twice
every week. You can ask her if you want to create this illusion – then
she is the master, Divya.</p><p><br></p><p>Then drop it and just remember: don’t ask for any happiness from
anybody – nobody can give it. Only you can give that gift to yourself,
it is a self-gift.</p><p><br></p><p>So give that gift to yourself and be happy! When you are happy<span class=s3></span>I am not saying not to relate with</p><p>people but now you relate from a totally different dimension: you
relate from happiness. Now you</p><p><br></p><p>relate from unhappiness, you relate like a beggar. Begin to relate
like an empress or emperor: you are not seeking anything from anybody,
you are sharing.</p><p><br></p><p>When love is not a seeking and not a need but a sharing, it has
tremendous beauty. Then nobody is worried about whether it is going to
last forever or not – why? If it is there only for this moment it is
perfectly good – one shares. If tomorrow you meet again with the man and
he is ready to meet you, you share again, otherwise good-bye! You thank
him because there was a moment when you shared and it was a happy
moment; you don’t want to make it a permanent thing. The idea of making
something permanent arises only because you are in need. You are afraid:
this man has given you happiness; tomorrow, if he says no – then you
will be again unhappy. So make arrangements that tomorrow he cannot
escape: lock the door! Once the door is locked that energy is no more
there, even in this moment, because love happens only in freedom.</p><p><br></p><p>Once the door is locked, once the man starts feeling that he has been
caught, once the woman starts feeling she has been caught, finished!
Now, it may take years for them to recognise the fact, but it is
finished right now! It depends: if you are very stupid it will take many
years; if you are intelligent a few months; if you are very very
intelligent a few days. If you are really alert this very moment you
will be able to see that you have killed it. The child is no more alive,
it is a corpse, because you tried to possess it.</p><p><br></p><p>And why does one want to possess? The reason is because you think:
‘Who is going to provide for me tomorrow? This man has provided
happiness for me today.’ The moment you recognise that this man has not
done anything, you have given a gift to yourself. Then there is no fear;
tomorrow again you can give it to yourself. Sometimes you can give it
together with somebody, sometimes you can give it when you are alone.
Nobody is giving it to you, it is only you giving it to yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>Sometimes we give indirectly: we give the gift to the person and then
he gives it back to you. He gives a gift which is really for himself, to
you and you give it back to him. This is just via the other but it is
your gift that you give yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>Once this is understood then there is no need to go such a long route
– a short circuit. You can simply give the gift from one hand to the
other hand and you are as happy as you are with anybody else: alone you
are happy.</p><p><br></p><p>So just remember it; nothing else has to be done. When you next start
creating the illusion again, remember about Divya... and relax! I am not
saying to become a nun, I am not saying that. I am saying to become an
individual, not a nun. Become an individual. Love out of joy but not out
of need. Love not as a beggar, love because you have too much and you
would like to share with somebody. Don’t try to hold anybody and don’t
try to cling, otherwise this will happen again and again. Then you will
have many loves in your life and many lovers.</p><p><br></p><p>Sometimes such an individual person, such a free person who is
capable of giving happiness to himself, such a person can love the same
person for many years but each time it is a new love affair because he
does not connect it in time; he does not think of the morrow. Today he
is finished with today.</p><p><br></p><p>Such a person goes to bed and he has finished with this world, this
world of today. Tomorrow morning he will rise again into another world.
Even if the person is the same, for such an individual</p><p><br></p><p>she is not the same. So maybe the person is the same or maybe the
person is not the same, it doesn’t make any difference: a man who is
happy goes on loving; a woman who is happy goes on loving.</p><p><br></p><p>And don’t ask anything out of love. It is good that one loves... in
loving, one is blissful. Thank the other that he accepted; thank the
other that he danced with you for a moment, sang with you for a moment,
and then be finished. No need to prolong it, no need to say ‘What about
tomorrow? What about the day after tomorrow?’</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t bring in the future – remain free. Tomorrow is going to bring
its own joys. Why make a repetition of today? Who knows? – better joys
are waiting for you tomorrow.</p><p><br></p><p>So be thrilled with the future but without any expectation... with no
hope, with no demand, just a thrill. The new is going to happen, the new
is bound to happen!</p><p><br></p><p>Very good... the insight is good, but I am afraid – will you be able
to keep it? That’s the problem. Try to keep it. Whenever you start
slipping out of it you Can just ask for a silent darshan, mm? and sit
here. The moment you see me you will remember, mm? Good!</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin says: I’ve become a sannyasin... after fifteen
months!]</p><p><br></p><p>That’s very good! It is early – people take fifteen lives! Fifteen
months is fast.… Very good! Whenever you really become a sannyasin it is
always early, mm? because sometimes it happens after thousands of lives.
One never becomes mature enough to understand what life is, mature
enough to rejoice in it... mature enough to go with it whole-heartedly
wherever it leads, and strong enough to surrender!</p><p><br></p><p>It is not the weak who surrender, the weak cannot surrender: they are
so afraid of their weakness. They protect themselves, how can they
surrender? They defend themselves, how can they surrender? It is only
the very very strong people who are capable of surrendering – because
they are not afraid!</p><p><br></p><p>And when one surrenders one becomes a sannyasin. It is a surrender,
an utter surrender ro life, and a trust... a trust which needs and knows
no conditions, an unconditional trust. Good.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part18>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

SOCRATES SAID: “KNOW THYSELF.” YOU HAVE SAID: “LET GO THYSELF!”\nPLEASE COMMENT.\nManeesha, the subject of Socratic dialogue is something special to be discussed. His use of the word ‘dialogue’ was very original; he means by it that truth can be discovered by discussing in a friendly way, respectful towards each other.\nThis way of finding the truth is bound to be only rational. That’s why Socrates cannot be counted as having reached the same heights as Gautam Buddha because at the ultimate peak of experience there is no dialogue, but only monologue. You are alone. There is nobody to whom you can say something and there is nothing which can be said. And the moment the other disappears, you also disappear because the existence of “I” and “thou” is together; you cannot separate them, they exist as two sides of one coin.\nI don’t agree with Socrates. His words are beautiful when he says, “Know thyself.” But Gurdjieff is far more important, because he says, “First be thyself; otherwise what are you going to know? First\nbecome an integrated individual, discover your freedom. In that very discovery you will find your being.”\nThe words of Socrates have been respected for twenty-five centuries, but they have many flaws. First, the moment you enter into the world of your being there is nobody; hence no possibility of dialogue. And if you think there is a possibility of dialogue between two enlightened people, you are wrong. The moment two enlightened people have ever come across each other, looked into each other’s eyes, the dialogue is finished, because they know that there is nothing to say.\nI have told you the incident of Kabir and Farid. Their meeting is immensely important. For two days they were together, and not a single word was uttered between them. They laughed, they hugged, they smiled, they kissed each other, but they did not say a single word.\nHundreds of disciples of Kabir and Farid were present, and they could not believe their eyes what has happened to these people? They are so wise, and they are behaving like small children! And they had gathered from faraway places just to hear the dialogue between these two enlightened persons, but the dialogue did not happen.\nAfter two days, when Farid had left on his pilgrimage, Kabir was asked, “What happened to you? You speak to us every day, but for these two days, when we were so expectant and so ready to listen, so alert not to miss a single word that passed between you two... what happened to you? Why did you become so silent?”\nKabir said, “Whatever I know, he knows. And whoever uttered the first word would have proved that he is still on the way, he has not reached.”\nGautam Buddha and Mahavira were contemporaries; they traveled for almost forty years continuously in the same province of Bihar. The name of the province Bihar comes from their traveling, bihar means ‘traveling’.\nThey passed through villages hundreds of times and there were so many times when they were in the same village, in the same city. At one moment they were in the same caravanserai: half of the place was occupied by Gautam Buddha and his disciples, and half by Mahavira and his disciples. But no dialogue not even a simple “Yaa-Hoo!”\nI would not have remained silent, that I can say to you. Enlightenment or no enlightenment, this much I would have done, because it is so nice... It means nothing, just a beautiful greeting with no meaning attached to it.\nIt looks a little cold that they did not even say, “Yaa-Hoo!” Whenever I meet them somewhere in the eternal journey it is bound to happen; the time is infinite, everything is possible I am going to give them a good salute, “Yaa-Hoo!” Because just yesterday we discovered the tremendous effect of the mantra.…\nI have decided that from now on this will be the sannyasin salute. Wherever two sannyasins meet “Yaa-Hoo!” There is no need to be so cold. Enlightenment is okay, but you should not become inhuman. A salute cannot disturb enlightenment... although “Yaa-Hoo” is very powerful.\nI have been dragged into a court because I used to live outside a city where there was a Mohammedan cemetery, and people used to come there to meditate. The Mohammedans came to me again and again, saying that “This is not good; your disciples are disturbing our sleeping ones.”\nI said, “Why? How can they disturb?”\nThey said, “They go on saying, ‘Hoo, hoo.’ Even a dead person feels like getting out of the grave to find out, ‘Who is this fellow?’”\nI said, “We cannot change it. And moreover it is really the last part of ALLAH-HOO. It is a Mohammedan mantra!”\nThey said, “You are very clever, but we have never heard of ALLAH-HOO. ALLAH is okay, but HOO?”\nI said, “You can do anything you want to do. If your ghosts come out of their graves, it is our problem, we live here. We will enjoy, we will entertain them; you don’t be worried.”\nThey said, “This man is difficult we are going to the court.” I said, “That is perfectly good, you go anywhere!”\nEven the judge said, “This is not a crime. Nowhere in any law book, in any constitution, any statute, is it written that saying ‘HOO’ is a crime. And don’t drag me into something with that man, because I know him.”\nBut they insisted. They said, “If you don’t take action, there is going to be a Hindu-Mohammedan riot.”\nThe judge said, “But he is not Hindu, so why bring Hindus into it?”\nThey said, “Whoever he is... but if near our cemetery anybody says ‘HOO’ there is going to be difficulty. Then don’t tell us that we are breaking the law.” So the judge summoned me. I went there with at least one hundred disciples. First we did “HOO” in the court. The judge was absolutely afraid, he said, “Wait! I cannot say that this is insulting the court, because there is no precedent, nobody has insulted anybody by saying ‘HOO.’ It is perfectly right but you frighten me! Perhaps those poor Mohammedans are right that the way you shout for one hour, even dead people will come alive. And it is natural for them to protect their dead; otherwise the dead will think that perhaps the Judgment Day has come... You can do your meditation somewhere else” because where I used to live there was a great lake, and mountains.\nHe said, “You can move anywhere. There is nothing that anybody can do against you. But why unnecessarily create trouble?”\nAnd today I have received one question: “I have been doing your meditation, ALLAH-HOO, for ten years, but last night I saw the effect of”Yaa-Hoo!” so I tried it instead of ALLAH-HOO, “Yaa-Hoo!” And it was such a tremendous transformation that a crowd gathered and people started thinking,\n‘What to do with this woman?’ I said, ‘I am doing my meditation.’ And they said, ‘Never heard about such a meditation’...”\nThey are right: they have never heard, because this is absolutely fresh and new, just born last night.\nSeeing her question... and there have been many questions like that “Great things hap-pened. We never expected that so quickly, thousands of people could get lost into a let-go.”\nI thought it was a very good meditation, but more than meditation it is a great salute. Around the world, wherever two sannyasins meet, greet each other... and let people’s hands shake, let people have heart attacks; let them do that is their problem, not your problem but your “Yaa-Hoo” should be really sharp. And to make it sharp your hand has to be there!\nManeesha, there has never been any dialogue between two enlightened persons. If you are left alone, you can have monologue but monologue is the monopoly of the mad people. Only mad people talk to themselves. You will find them if you stand by the side of the road you don’t have to go to a madhouse, you are in the madhouse. Just sit by the side of the road, and somebody is talking, somebody is making gestures, somebody is thinking, you can see, the lips are moving! somebody is taking a decision: “No...” And there is nobody else on the road. This is monologue.\nNo enlightened person will do monologue either. And the discovery of truth from dialogue has never been possible. Only two ignorant persons can have dialogue.\nThese are the three possibilities:\nTwo enlightened persons, one possibility no dialogue.\nSecond possibility: two ignorant persons much possibility of dialogue, but no conclusion.\nOne enlightened person alone he will be silent. What to say about dialogue, there is no question even of monologue.\nDialogue has only one small possibility, and that is between the master and the disciple; one who knows and one who is ready to know. But in the Greek tradition there is no place for the master- disciple phenomenon. It has happened only in the East particularly in this land, it was originated that when somebody comes to know, it is his absolute duty to share his experience with those who do not know. Whether they listen or not should not be the concern.\nIf you talk to a hundred persons, perhaps one may listen. That is enough reward: you have opened one person’s eyes amongst thousands of blind people. Hence, although dialogue is associated with the name of Socrates, dialogue did not happen in Socrates’ life itself. He himself was not enlightened till the last moment of his life. He became enlightened when the poison was given to him, and there was no time left for any dialogue.\nStill, he tried to say a few things because his basic contention was that “Unless I know, how can I tell you? You ask me what death is and I am still alive how can I say to you what death is? Let me die first.”\nBut people said, “Many have deceived us; they say, ‘Let us die first’ and then they die and they don’t even give a call. They simply disappear. What is the guarantee that when you die you will tell us the truth?”\nHe said, “I will try my best” and he tried his best. Not after death, but just in between, because his death happened by poison and poison takes a little time. So he was hanging between life and death for a few minutes. In those few minutes he said the most important thing. It is the only dialogue worth calling significant.\nHe said, as the poison was given, “My feet have become numb, I cannot feel my feet, but I am still whole. Inside I don’t feel that anything is missing. My hands have become numb, I don’t feel that I have hands. I can see them, but they are dead. But inside me I am as whole as I have always been. I don’t see that I am missing anything. My heart is sinking; perhaps I may not be able to say anything more. This may be my last statement, that death only separates the body and consciousness; it does not kill, because I am still absolutely whole. I have not lost anything. My consciousness is as pure, as alive, as it has ever been.”\nThat was the only authentic dialogue. But that too was happening between a man who was just coming closer to the truth of death, and people who had no idea what death is. And if you don’t have any idea of what death is, you cannot have any idea of what life is. They are all together. The man of meditation...\nAnd Socrates was not a man of meditation. He was a great rationalist, a great philosopher and thinker, but not a mystic. He was a mystic only for those three or four minutes between the poisoning and his death. But he was perhaps the keenest intellect the world has ever known. His saying, “Know thyself,” is perfectly true, but it is not possible to know thyself by dialogue.\nWith whom are you going to have the dialogue? With your wife? With your husband? With whom? You look all around ask people “Please let us have a dialogue.” And they will say, “Get lost dialogue, my foot! What have I to do with dialogue? Dialogues happen only in movies, this is real life!”\nBut in the history of Greece, Socrates was the first man to at least indicate towards the ultimate truth of knowing oneself. But he could not devise methods and strategies through which one can reach to oneself. He could not find a way for the pilgrims, for the seekers. He remained a philosopher. He could not become the enlightened, the awakened, the buddha. It is unfortunate that such a great, intelligent man, a giant of the whole of history, wasted his whole life discussing with all kinds of people.\nMy own understanding is that he was crucified not because he was doing anything harmful people were bored, he was harassing people. Dialogue, that is what killed him. It is said that people would see him and change their routes, because even to meet him meant the beginning of a dialogue. Say something and immediately that becomes a question, and he will go to the deepest roots of the problem. “But,” you say, “we are going to the market and this is not the time to understand these great things that you are talking about! Sometime when we have time we will come.”\nAthens became so bored that this old man had to be somehow got rid of. He has not committed any crime, but he has corrupted many people’s minds, puzzled their minds, confused their minds. They\nwere living peacefully with the consolation that there is a God, and he has created suspicion. He creates doubt in people’s minds about everything. He even says, “What is the proof that the world exists? Can you prove it? What is the proof that you are real?”\nVery difficult. Who knows whether you are real, or just some character in somebody’s dream?\nOne Egyptian pharaoh had ordered in Egypt that “I want everybody to know that nobody should come into my dream, because I don’t want any disturbance in the night. The day is enough; the night is absolutely mine. If anybody comes, soon the next day he will be shot dead.”\nPeople became very afraid. “This is a strange thing; nobody goes into anybody’s dream...” His ministers tried to convince him: “This is not right! And most probably we are the people who will come into your dream. But we are not coming; you are dreaming about us.”\nHe said, “Don’t befool me. When somebody comes into my dream I will recognize the face and you will see tomorrow that he is hanging on a post outside the gate.”\nThe ministers said, “We want to resign, because to be close to you is dangerous!”\nYou don’t dream about people you have not known. Eskimos don’t come into your dreams. In your dreams the neighbor’s wife comes. Certainly your wife never comes into your dreams. I have never come across a man who says that his wife comes into his dreams. But neighbors’ wives are very dangerous, they always harass people all around. Perhaps your own wife will be harassing other neighbors, that’s another matter.\nSocrates has left a very wrong heritage in a way, because he founded the very base of the Western mind. What has happened to the West... Socrates is in the roots. It is according to his advice that flowers like Hiroshima, Nagasaki, have blossomed; that nuclear weapons are ready at any moment to destroy the world, although you cannot see a direct connection. But he is the man who insisted on sharpening your reason, your intellect, and this he thought is knowing yourself.\nIt is not. Although he said, “Know thyself,” he really means, “Know thy intelligence.”\nHe does not mean the same thing as when I say know thyself the words are the same, but the meaning is different. When I say know thyself, I say put your mind aside, your reason aside, your thoughts aside; your logic, your rationality, put everything aside and know the simple, innocent, silent sky of your being. That was not the meaning of Socrates, certainly.\nAnd Maneesha, you have not heard me right. You say, “I detect an essential difference: Socrates said: ‘Know thyself.’ You have said: ‘Let go thyself!’”\nI was simply saying let go. “Thyself” you have heard; I don’t know from where. Thousands of witnesses are here.\nIf I have to use the word ‘thyself’, I will say, “Kill thyself, so that you can be.” Be. That’s enough.\nAnd in deep silence there is no knowing, but a kind of taste, a kind of fragrance, a kind of beauty, a kind of sense of eternity, immortality. But not very definite knowledge that you can write about to your friend, that “I have come to know these things, one by one, the whole list.”\nI have not said, Maneesha, “Let go thyself.”\nBut if you really want, then we can manage a new meaning to it: Let go thyself, so that you can be. But that will be totally different from Socrates. The small word you have added thyself makes an immense difference. Let-go is a simple phenomenon. It is not a question of who is going into this let-go. And last night when you went into let-go, there was nobody. Everybody was gone.\nSeeing that everybody was gone, I was gone too. I was feeling hungry and I said, “I don’t know when these people are going to be back.” And I sent Shunyo to check whether people had come back or gone. She reported, “Don’t be worried; a few have come back, but most are still flat. A few are coming back, a few are moving towards the canteen...” But now I see that everybody has come back.\nSo this let-go is beautiful; you take a dip, and you come out fresh and young. Last night must have been the most beautiful night in your life.\n... So it seems it is time to pray. This time to pray comes too soon and goes too fast.\nHamish MacTavish comes stumbling into the golf clubhouse, enters the bar and orders a large scotch in a shaky voice. “Great Scot!” cries the bartender, “what happened to you?”\n“The tenth hole!” gasps Hamish. “I hit a brand new Dunlop ball into the field. I could not find it anywhere. Then I saw a cow standing there, so I lifted up her tail. And there was a ball, stuck in there. But it was a Goodyear ball.\n“Just then, a woman came up behind me looking for her ball. I lifted up the cow’s tail again, and said to the woman, ‘Does this look like yours?’ and she hit me over the head with her club!”\nRamananda has asked:\nQuestion 2\nI TALK IN MY SLEEP. THE OTHER MORNING A GIRLFRIEND... SORRY “MY GIRLFRIEND” LAUGHINGLY TOLD ME, “YOU WERE SO FUNNY LAST NIGHT. YOU SAID, ‘I AM ENLIGHTENED’ THREE TIMES, AND THEN YOU SANG A SONG.”\nBELOVED MASTER, WHO IS ENLIGHTENED?\nI think it must be the girlfriend. You were asleep, and certainly you cannot be enlightened in sleep. Only your girlfriend was awake and seems to be a permanent girlfriend, because if she was just a temporary one, she would not have cared at all whether you were enlightened one time or three times. She may have even hit you because you were singing a song in your sleep and disturbing her sleep.\nI think, Ramananda... you are certainly not enlightened. Only the girlfriend is left. You just become a disciple of the girlfriend. It will be such a joy... I want a few women to become masters, because in the past man has not allowed them to become masters. Although they have great qualities... Otherwise who cares what you are talking in your sleep? She would have put a pillow on your face and in the morning we would have had to make a celebration!\nStrange questions come to me. One question is from Christiane:\nQuestion 3\nI CAME ALL THE WAY FROM BELGIUM TO SEE YOU FOR TWO DAYS ONLY. WHY DO I FEEL LIKE A BAT\nAMONG THE BIRDS, I FEEL A RAT, AMONG THE RATS, I SAY I AM A BIRD\nWHERE DO I BELONG?\nI LOVE YOUR BOOKS, THEY MAKE ME LAUGH AND THEY MAKE ME CRY, THEY MAKE ME LIVE ALSO.\nIt is a very difficult problem. One thing is certain: you are not a bird, you are a rat. That’s what I was wondering who is eating my books? Certainly they are rats; birds don’t eat books. And coming from Belgium just to eat books? And only staying two days? You could have sent a card to ask, “Please, send all the damaged books. I live on them, I laugh, I eat, I am a rat!”\nI hope you will not stay longer than a few days. Already you have destroyed many books. This is not nice, and your name is Christiane. It is not even Christian!\nAnd now I think the prayer should begin...\nHerbie’s father sends him to New York to learn the undertaking business from the legendary Moishe Finkelstein. Some months later, Herbie returns and his father asks him what he has learned.\n“I have learned a lot, dad,” says Herbie. “It has been very interesting, as we had one wild experience that taught me a lesson.”\n“What was that, son?” asks his dad.\n“Well,” says Herbie, “one day, we got a phone call from the best hotel in New York. A man and a woman had died in their sleep, completely naked.”\n“My God!” says his father, “what did Mr. Finkelstein do?”\n“Well,” says Herbie, “we got dressed in our best suits and drove over in the limousine. We arrived at the room very quietly and with great dignity.”\n“Wow!” exclaims his father, “and then what?”\n“Well,” continues Herbie, “Mr. Finkelstein pushed open the door with his gold-tipped cane, and we went quietly inside. Sure enough, there was this naked couple lying on their backs.

SOCRATES SAID: “KNOW THYSELF.”
YOU HAVE SAID: “LET GO THYSELF!”</p><p><br></p><p>PLEASE COMMENT.</p><p><br></p><p>Maneesha, the subject of Socratic dialogue is something special to be
discussed. His use of the word ‘dialogue’ was very original; he means by
it that truth can be discovered by discussing in a friendly way,
respectful towards each other.</p><p><br></p><p>This way of finding the truth is bound to be only rational. That’s
why Socrates cannot be counted as having reached the same heights as
Gautam Buddha because at the ultimate peak of experience there is no
dialogue, but only monologue. You are alone. There is nobody to whom you
can say something and there is nothing which can be said. And the moment
the other disappears, you also disappear because the existence of “I”
and “thou” is together; you cannot separate them, they exist as two
sides of one coin.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t agree with Socrates. His words are beautiful when he says,
“Know thyself.” But Gurdjieff is far more important, because he says,
“First be thyself; otherwise what are you going to know? First</p><p>become an integrated individual, discover your freedom. In that very
discovery you will find your being.”</p><p><br></p><p>The words of Socrates have been respected for twenty-five centuries,
but they have many flaws. First, the moment you enter into the world of
your being there is nobody; hence no possibility of dialogue. And if you
think there is a possibility of dialogue between two enlightened people,
you are wrong. The moment two enlightened people have ever come across
each other, looked into each other’s eyes, the dialogue is finished,
because they know that there is nothing to say.</p><p><br></p><p>I have told you the incident of Kabir and Farid. Their meeting is
immensely important. For two days they were together, and not a single
word was uttered between them. They laughed, they hugged, they smiled,
they kissed each other, but they did not say a single word.</p><p><br></p><p>Hundreds of disciples of Kabir and Farid were present, and they could
not believe their eyes what has happened to these people? They are so
wise, and they are behaving like small children! And they had gathered
from faraway places just to hear the dialogue between these two
enlightened persons, but the dialogue did not happen.</p><p><br></p><p>After two days, when Farid had left on his pilgrimage, Kabir was
asked, “What happened to you? You speak to us every day, but for these
two days, when we were so expectant and so ready to listen, so alert not
to miss a single word that passed between you two... what happened to
you? Why did you become so silent?”</p><p><br></p><p>Kabir said, “Whatever I know, he knows. And whoever uttered the first
word would have proved that he is still on the way, he has not
reached.”</p><p><br></p><p>Gautam Buddha and Mahavira were contemporaries; they traveled for
almost forty years continuously in the same province of Bihar. The name
of the province Bihar comes from their traveling, bihar means
‘traveling’.</p><p><br></p><p>They passed through villages hundreds of times and there were so many
times when they were in the same village, in the same city. At one
moment they were in the same caravanserai: half of the place was
occupied by Gautam Buddha and his disciples, and half by Mahavira and
his disciples. But no dialogue not even a simple “Yaa-Hoo!”</p><p><br></p><p>I would not have remained silent, that I can say to you.
Enlightenment or no enlightenment, this much I would have done, because
it is so nice... It means nothing, just a beautiful greeting with no
meaning attached to it.</p><p><br></p><p>It looks a little cold that they did not even say, “Yaa-Hoo!”
Whenever I meet them somewhere in the eternal journey it is bound to
happen; the time is infinite, everything is possible I am going to give
them a good salute, “Yaa-Hoo!” Because just yesterday we discovered the
tremendous effect of the mantra.…</p><p><br></p><p>I have decided that from now on this will be the sannyasin salute.
Wherever two sannyasins meet “Yaa-Hoo!” There is no need to be so cold.
Enlightenment is okay, but you should not become inhuman. A salute
cannot disturb enlightenment... although “Yaa-Hoo” is very powerful.</p><p>I have been dragged into a court because I used to live outside a
city where there was a Mohammedan cemetery, and people used to come
there to meditate. The Mohammedans came to me again and again, saying
that “This is not good; your disciples are disturbing our sleeping
ones.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Why? How can they disturb?”</p><p><br></p><p>They said, “They go on saying, ‘Hoo, hoo.’ Even a dead person feels
like getting out of the grave to find out, ‘Who is this fellow?’”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “We cannot change it. And moreover it is really the last part
of ALLAH-HOO. It is a Mohammedan mantra!”</p><p><br></p><p>They said, “You are very clever, but we have never heard of
ALLAH-HOO. ALLAH is okay, but HOO?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “You can do anything you want to do. If your ghosts come out
of their graves, it is our problem, we live here. We will enjoy, we will
entertain them; you don’t be worried.”</p><p><br></p><p>They said, “This man is difficult we are going to the court.” I said,
“That is perfectly good, you go anywhere!”</p><p>Even the judge said, “This is not a crime. Nowhere in any law book,
in any constitution, any statute, is it written that saying ‘HOO’ is a
crime. And don’t drag me into something with that man, because I know
him.”</p><p><br></p><p>But they insisted. They said, “If you don’t take action, there is
going to be a Hindu-Mohammedan riot.”</p><p><br></p><p>The judge said, “But he is not Hindu, so why bring Hindus into
it?”</p><p><br></p><p>They said, “Whoever he is... but if near our cemetery anybody says
‘HOO’ there is going to be difficulty. Then don’t tell us that we are
breaking the law.” So the judge summoned me. I went there with at least
one hundred disciples. First we did “HOO” in the court. The judge was
absolutely afraid, he said, “Wait! I cannot say that this is insulting
the court, because there is no precedent, nobody has insulted anybody by
saying ‘HOO.’ It is perfectly right but you frighten me! Perhaps those
poor Mohammedans are right that the way you shout for one hour, even
dead people will come alive. And it is natural for them to protect their
dead; otherwise the dead will think that perhaps the Judgment Day has
come... You can do your meditation somewhere else” because where I used
to live there was a great lake, and mountains.</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “You can move anywhere. There is nothing that anybody can do
against you. But why unnecessarily create trouble?”</p><p><br></p><p>And today I have received one question: “I have been doing your
meditation, ALLAH-HOO, for ten years, but last night I saw the effect
of”Yaa-Hoo!” so I tried it instead of ALLAH-HOO, “Yaa-Hoo!” And it was
such a tremendous transformation that a crowd gathered and people
started thinking,</p><p>‘What to do with this woman?’ I said, ‘I am doing my meditation.’ And
they said, ‘Never heard about such a meditation’...”</p><p><br></p><p>They are right: they have never heard, because this is absolutely
fresh and new, just born last night.</p><p><br></p><p>Seeing her question... and there have been many questions like that
“Great things hap-pened. We never expected that so quickly, thousands of
people could get lost into a let-go.”</p><p><br></p><p>I thought it was a very good meditation, but more than meditation it
is a great salute. Around the world, wherever two sannyasins meet, greet
each other... and let people’s hands shake, let people have heart
attacks; let them do that is their problem, not your problem but your
“Yaa-Hoo” should be really sharp. And to make it sharp your hand has to
be there!</p><p><br></p><p>Maneesha, there has never been any dialogue between two enlightened
persons. If you are left alone, you can have monologue but monologue is
the monopoly of the mad people. Only mad people talk to themselves. You
will find them if you stand by the side of the road you don’t have to go
to a madhouse, you are in the madhouse. Just sit by the side of the
road, and somebody is talking, somebody is making gestures, somebody is
thinking, you can see, the lips are moving! somebody is taking a
decision: “No...” And there is nobody else on the road. This is
monologue.</p><p><br></p><p>No enlightened person will do monologue either. And the discovery of
truth from dialogue has never been possible. Only two ignorant persons
can have dialogue.</p><p><br></p><p>These are the three possibilities:</p><p><br></p><p>Two enlightened persons, one possibility no dialogue.</p><p><br></p><p>Second possibility: two ignorant persons much possibility of
dialogue, but no conclusion.</p><p><br></p><p>One enlightened person alone he will be silent. What to say about
dialogue, there is no question even of monologue.</p><p><br></p><p>Dialogue has only one small possibility, and that is between the
master and the disciple; one who knows and one who is ready to know. But
in the Greek tradition there is no place for the master- disciple
phenomenon. It has happened only in the East particularly in this land,
it was originated that when somebody comes to know, it is his absolute
duty to share his experience with those who do not know. Whether they
listen or not should not be the concern.</p><p><br></p><p>If you talk to a hundred persons, perhaps one may listen. That is
enough reward: you have opened one person’s eyes amongst thousands of
blind people. Hence, although dialogue is associated with the name of
Socrates, dialogue did not happen in Socrates’ life itself. He himself
was not enlightened till the last moment of his life. He became
enlightened when the poison was given to him, and there was no time left
for any dialogue.</p><p><br></p><p>Still, he tried to say a few things because his basic contention was
that “Unless I know, how can I tell you? You ask me what death is and I
am still alive how can I say to you what death is? Let me die
first.”</p><p>But people said, “Many have deceived us; they say, ‘Let us die first’
and then they die and they don’t even give a call. They simply
disappear. What is the guarantee that when you die you will tell us the
truth?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I will try my best” and he tried his best. Not after death,
but just in between, because his death happened by poison and poison
takes a little time. So he was hanging between life and death for a few
minutes. In those few minutes he said the most important thing. It is
the only dialogue worth calling significant.</p><p><br></p><p>He said, as the poison was given, “My feet have become numb, I cannot
feel my feet, but I am still whole. Inside I don’t feel that anything is
missing. My hands have become numb, I don’t feel that I have hands. I
can see them, but they are dead. But inside me I am as whole as I have
always been. I don’t see that I am missing anything. My heart is
sinking; perhaps I may not be able to say anything more. This may be my
last statement, that death only separates the body and consciousness; it
does not kill, because I am still absolutely whole. I have not lost
anything. My consciousness is as pure, as alive, as it has ever
been.”</p><p><br></p><p>That was the only authentic dialogue. But that too was happening
between a man who was just coming closer to the truth of death, and
people who had no idea what death is. And if you don’t have any idea of
what death is, you cannot have any idea of what life is. They are all
together. The man of meditation...</p><p><br></p><p>And Socrates was not a man of meditation. He was a great rationalist,
a great philosopher and thinker, but not a mystic. He was a mystic only
for those three or four minutes between the poisoning and his death. But
he was perhaps the keenest intellect the world has ever known. His
saying, “Know thyself,” is perfectly true, but it is not possible to
know thyself by dialogue.</p><p><br></p><p>With whom are you going to have the dialogue? With your wife? With
your husband? With whom? You look all around ask people “Please let us
have a dialogue.” And they will say, “Get lost dialogue, my foot! What
have I to do with dialogue? Dialogues happen only in movies, this is
real life!”</p><p><br></p><p>But in the history of Greece, Socrates was the first man to at least
indicate towards the ultimate truth of knowing oneself. But he could not
devise methods and strategies through which one can reach to oneself. He
could not find a way for the pilgrims, for the seekers. He remained a
philosopher. He could not become the enlightened, the awakened, the
buddha. It is unfortunate that such a great, intelligent man, a giant of
the whole of history, wasted his whole life discussing with all kinds of
people.</p><p><br></p><p>My own understanding is that he was crucified not because he was
doing anything harmful people were bored, he was harassing people.
Dialogue, that is what killed him. It is said that people would see him
and change their routes, because even to meet him meant the beginning of
a dialogue. Say something and immediately that becomes a question, and
he will go to the deepest roots of the problem. “But,” you say, “we are
going to the market and this is not the time to understand these great
things that you are talking about! Sometime when we have time we will
come.”</p><p><br></p><p>Athens became so bored that this old man had to be somehow got rid
of. He has not committed any crime, but he has corrupted many people’s
minds, puzzled their minds, confused their minds. They</p><p>were living peacefully with the consolation that there is a God, and
he has created suspicion. He creates doubt in people’s minds about
everything. He even says, “What is the proof that the world exists? Can
you prove it? What is the proof that you are real?”</p><p><br></p><p>Very difficult. Who knows whether you are real, or just some
character in somebody’s dream?</p><p><br></p><p>One Egyptian pharaoh had ordered in Egypt that “I want everybody to
know that nobody should come into my dream, because I don’t want any
disturbance in the night. The day is enough; the night is absolutely
mine. If anybody comes, soon the next day he will be shot dead.”</p><p><br></p><p>People became very afraid. “This is a strange thing; nobody goes into
anybody’s dream...” His ministers tried to convince him: “This is not
right! And most probably we are the people who will come into your
dream. But we are not coming; you are dreaming about us.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Don’t befool me. When somebody comes into my dream I will
recognize the face and you will see tomorrow that he is hanging on a
post outside the gate.”</p><p><br></p><p>The ministers said, “We want to resign, because to be close to you is
dangerous!”</p><p><br></p><p>You don’t dream about people you have not known. Eskimos don’t come
into your dreams. In your dreams the neighbor’s wife comes. Certainly
your wife never comes into your dreams. I have never come across a man
who says that his wife comes into his dreams. But neighbors’ wives are
very dangerous, they always harass people all around. Perhaps your own
wife will be harassing other neighbors, that’s another matter.</p><p><br></p><p>Socrates has left a very wrong heritage in a way, because he founded
the very base of the Western mind. What has happened to the West...
Socrates is in the roots. It is according to his advice that flowers
like Hiroshima, Nagasaki, have blossomed; that nuclear weapons are ready
at any moment to destroy the world, although you cannot see a direct
connection. But he is the man who insisted on sharpening your reason,
your intellect, and this he thought is knowing yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not. Although he said, “Know thyself,” he really means, “Know
thy intelligence.”</p><p><br></p><p>He does not mean the same thing as when I say know thyself the words
are the same, but the meaning is different. When I say know thyself, I
say put your mind aside, your reason aside, your thoughts aside; your
logic, your rationality, put everything aside and know the simple,
innocent, silent sky of your being. That was not the meaning of
Socrates, certainly.</p><p><br></p><p>And Maneesha, you have not heard me right. You say, “I detect an
essential difference: Socrates said: ‘Know thyself.’ You have said: ‘Let
go thyself!’”</p><p><br></p><p>I was simply saying let go. “Thyself” you have heard; I don’t know
from where. Thousands of witnesses are here.</p><p><br></p><p>If I have to use the word ‘thyself’, I will say, “Kill thyself, so
that you can be.” Be. That’s enough.</p><p>And in deep silence there is no knowing, but a kind of taste, a kind
of fragrance, a kind of beauty, a kind of sense of eternity,
immortality. But not very definite knowledge that you can write about to
your friend, that “I have come to know these things, one by one, the
whole list.”</p><p><br></p><p>I have not said, Maneesha, “Let go thyself.”</p><p><br></p><p>But if you really want, then we can manage a new meaning to it: Let
go thyself, so that you can be. But that will be totally different from
Socrates. The small word you have added thyself makes an immense
difference. Let-go is a simple phenomenon. It is not a question of who
is going into this let-go. And last night when you went into let-go,
there was nobody. Everybody was gone.</p><p><br></p><p>Seeing that everybody was gone, I was gone too. I was feeling hungry
and I said, “I don’t know when these people are going to be back.” And I
sent Shunyo to check whether people had come back or gone. She reported,
“Don’t be worried; a few have come back, but most are still flat. A few
are coming back, a few are moving towards the canteen...” But now I see
that everybody has come back.</p><p><br></p><p>So this let-go is beautiful; you take a dip, and you come out fresh
and young. Last night must have been the most beautiful night in your
life.</p><p>... So it seems it is time to pray. This time to pray comes too soon
and goes too fast.</p><p><br></p><p>Hamish MacTavish comes stumbling into the golf clubhouse, enters the
bar and orders a large scotch in a shaky voice. “Great Scot!” cries the
bartender, “what happened to you?”</p><p><br></p><p>“The tenth hole!” gasps Hamish. “I hit a brand new Dunlop ball into
the field. I could not find it anywhere. Then I saw a cow standing
there, so I lifted up her tail. And there was a ball, stuck in there.
But it was a Goodyear ball.</p><p><br></p><p>“Just then, a woman came up behind me looking for her ball. I lifted
up the cow’s tail again, and said to the woman, ‘Does this look like
yours?’ and she hit me over the head with her club!”</p><p><br></p><p>Ramananda has asked:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2</p><p><br></p><p>I TALK IN MY SLEEP. THE OTHER MORNING A GIRLFRIEND... SORRY “MY
GIRLFRIEND” LAUGHINGLY TOLD ME, “YOU WERE SO FUNNY LAST NIGHT. YOU SAID,
‘I AM ENLIGHTENED’ THREE TIMES, AND THEN YOU SANG A SONG.”</p><p><br></p><p>BELOVED MASTER, WHO IS ENLIGHTENED?</p><p><br></p><p>I think it must be the girlfriend. You were asleep, and certainly you
cannot be enlightened in sleep. Only your girlfriend was awake and seems
to be a permanent girlfriend, because if she was just a temporary one,
she would not have cared at all whether you were enlightened one time or
three times. She may have even hit you because you were singing a song
in your sleep and disturbing her sleep.</p><p>I think, Ramananda... you are certainly not enlightened. Only the
girlfriend is left. You just become a disciple of the girlfriend. It
will be such a joy... I want a few women to become masters, because in
the past man has not allowed them to become masters. Although they have
great qualities... Otherwise who cares what you are talking in your
sleep? She would have put a pillow on your face and in the morning we
would have had to make a celebration!</p><p><br></p><p>Strange questions come to me. One question is from Christiane:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 3</p><p><br></p><p>I CAME ALL THE WAY FROM BELGIUM TO SEE YOU FOR TWO DAYS ONLY. WHY DO
I FEEL LIKE A BAT</p><p>AMONG THE BIRDS, I FEEL A RAT, AMONG THE RATS, I SAY I AM A BIRD</p><p>WHERE DO I BELONG?</p><p><br></p><p>I LOVE YOUR BOOKS, THEY MAKE ME LAUGH AND THEY MAKE ME CRY, THEY MAKE
ME LIVE ALSO.</p><p>It is a very difficult problem. One thing is certain: you are not a
bird, you are a rat. That’s what I was wondering who is eating my books?
Certainly they are rats; birds don’t eat books. And coming from Belgium
just to eat books? And only staying two days? You could have sent a card
to ask, “Please, send all the damaged books. I live on them, I laugh, I
eat, I am a rat!”</p><p><br></p><p>I hope you will not stay longer than a few days. Already you have
destroyed many books. This is not nice, and your name is Christiane. It
is not even Christian!</p><p><br></p><p>And now I think the prayer should begin...</p><p><br></p><p>Herbie’s father sends him to New York to learn the undertaking
business from the legendary Moishe Finkelstein. Some months later,
Herbie returns and his father asks him what he has learned.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have learned a lot, dad,” says Herbie. “It has been very
interesting, as we had one wild experience that taught me a lesson.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What was that, son?” asks his dad.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well,” says Herbie, “one day, we got a phone call from the best
hotel in New York. A man and a woman had died in their sleep, completely
naked.”</p><p>“My God!” says his father, “what did Mr. Finkelstein do?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well,” says Herbie, “we got dressed in our best suits and drove over
in the limousine. We arrived at the room very quietly and with great
dignity.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Wow!” exclaims his father, “and then what?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well,” continues Herbie, “Mr. Finkelstein pushed open the door with
his gold-tipped cane, and we went quietly inside. Sure enough, there was
this naked couple lying on their backs. And immediately, Mr. Finkelstein
saw a problem: the man had a large erection.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What did you do?” asks his father.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well,” says Herbie, “as always, Mr. Finkelstein was ready for the
situation. He swung his gold-tipped cane and very stylishly, whacked the
prick!”</p><p><br></p><p>“And then what happened?” asks his father.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, dad,” says Herbie, “then all hell broke loose! You see, we
were in the wrong room!” Okay, Maneesha?</p><p>Yes, Osho.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part6>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

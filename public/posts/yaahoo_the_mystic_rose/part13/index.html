WHAT MORE CAN WE DO SO THAT YOU WILL BE HEARD AND THE BAD VISION OF THE YEAR 2017 THAT I HAVE WILL NOT HAPPEN?\nDhyandeep, the first thing to remember is: do not take anything seriously. What happens in 2017 is not your concern. One thing is certain: you will not be there. So who cares? Particularly herenow in Poona! If by chance you are still alive – which is very much an impossibility – still you will be living in the herenow. The years change, the centuries change, but life is always here and now.\nWasting it in thinking about the past... and there are many who do that. Just on my way here, Shunyo was saying, “Today is Friday...” I don’t know, because what concern have I to remember which day it is, or which year, or which century? I am herenow.\nHer question was that “This is Friday; Jesus was crucified on this day. Why is it called Good Friday?” As if, it seems, I have crucified Jesus! I am not answerable at all. Naturally, the people who had crucified Jesus must have celebrated. That was their goodbye to Jesus – “We are finished with this guy who has been torturing us for so long.” It is not a good thing, but it is not in my hands.\nIf it had been in my hands, Jesus needed psychiatric treatment. A good body stretch until he had forgotten to say that “I am the only begotten son of God.” Then it would certainly have been Good Friday because then there would have been no Christianity. It is the crucifixion which started the greatest criminal religion on the earth, Christianity.\nBut the Jews were not so sophisticated that they could have tolerated a young man, only thirty-three years of age, trotting on his donkey here and there. Never went out of that small place, Judea. And he had a few followers – every idiot can collect a dozen followers, and he had exactly one dozen followers.\nThose twelve idiots became twelve apostles, and they followed him because they had no other business. They were not educated; not a single one of them was cultured, educated, a rabbi, a learned man. None of them had any knowledge of the scriptures. And on their own, they knew one thing for certain, that they could not enter into paradise. They didn’t have any qualifications. And this guy sitting on the donkey says, “If you believe in me, I will take you into paradise.”\nAll those fools must have thought, “This is the simplest way. Rather than becoming a rabbi, a great learned scholar, virtuous, a saint, disciplining, torturing yourself... then, too, there is no certainty, no guarantee. Nobody is saying to you that ‘I am responsible.’ At least this guy says, ‘I am taking you. Just believe in me.’ And he is not asking anything, not even any entry fee.” And who would not like to see the scene without a ticket?\nThere were moments of doubt in their minds also, that God’s son should not sit on a donkey. And they all knew that he was a carpenter’s son, but what to do? He does not listen at all.\nIf people had simply tolerated him as a joke, which in fact he was – a practical joke... People should have laughed. And he was bringing such great news! They should have enjoyed, entertained him, but they were not sophisticated enough. They took him too seriously.\nThat’s what I am saying:\nThe most important thing is not to take anything seriously.\nJesus took himself very seriously. Even when they were putting him on the cross, he could have said, “Wait, I have changed my mind!” He carried the joke too far. In his place, I should have certainly said, “I have changed my mind.” A joke is a joke; one should not take it too seriously.\nAnd he would have left the Jews and the Romans who crucified him in a very weird space: What to do? He has changed his mind! But he took himself so seriously that he allowed them to put him on the cross, nail him on the cross. Still, he was waiting for God and looking upwards. And the sky by chance was completely empty.\nHis idea was that on a white cloud... Obviously, it has to be a white cloud when God comes. He will come thundering and show all the Jews – “You are stupid, you are killing my own son and you think you believe in God?” But nothing seemed to happen.\nThousands of people had gathered to see – the one and only chance; for the first time somebody has claimed to be the only begotten son. And he was certainly serious because even on the cross\nhe did not just say, “It is enough. My father’s name is Joseph, my mother’s name is Mary, and I don’t know who is this God.” He had enjoyed enough, he was a celebrity in his own small country, but he waited.…\nAnd the Jewish way of putting somebody on a cross is such that a person can be alive on the cross at least forty-eight hours, because they don’t kill you by breaking the neck. They kill you by nailing the hands and the feet to the cross, so drop by drop the blood oozes out. It is the most cruel and ugly way of taking revenge. But that was good in a way; it gave forty-eight hours for the person to change his mind.\nBut Jesus wouldn’t change. On the contrary, he shouted at God! Thousands of people are there, everybody wants to know God, to see God – so much one has heard about God, and never a single witness. And this great opportunity... people had come from faraway places.\nJesus shouted at God – “Father!”... but he still did not forget to call him “father.” He was really an absolute crackpot. “Father, have you forgotten me? have you forsaken me? Why is the miracle not happening?”\nIt was all his fiction – his God, who will descend on a white cloud; that he will save him and show the world that Jesus is his only son, “and anybody who wants to be saved from this miserable suffering life and enter into the eternal bliss of paradise has to believe in my son. He is my agent. You cannot directly contact me. Call him, and if he chooses you will be allowed. Even on the Judgment Day when all the dead of the past and the future will be raised from their graves...”\nIt is going to be a tremendous crowd. The world has never seen such a crowd. I don’t think the earth can contain that much crowd. Five billion people are alive today and man has existed for at least four million years. The crowd will be so much, and Jesus will choose: “Who are my people?”\nBut nothing happened. Fictions are fictions. There is no God and there is no God’s son.\nAnd all the messengers are megalomaniacs who need to be immediately caught and treated before they get out of hand.\nBut they have founded religions, they have written great scriptures. They have done such harm to humanity.\nSo there are many who are concerned about the past.…\nNow Shunyo is asking, “Why is this day called Good Friday?” Good for the Jews because they got rid of Jesus and good for Christians because this is the beginning of their religion. But as far as we are concerned it is just ordinary Friday. There is nothing special in it, neither good nor bad.\nAnd I am not at all certain whether it is Friday or not. I am simply taking her question without giving my consent that this is Friday. In fact, all these seven days and their names are our arbitrary names. There is no existential reality behind them; it is not like the sun and the moon and the earth. They\nare just our ideas. They represent one thing certainly, that once upon a time somewhere long past, thousands of years before, humanity must have lived in a small tribe. And from that tribe people started to grow more and more, and started spreading all over the earth. So a few things they have carried from those days.\nFor example, every language has ten digits because man has ten fingers. The primitive man counted everything on his fingers. Even I myself count everything on my fingers. Then, too, I get lost after the fourth because so many things come in between.\nAnd just like the ten digits of language, of mathematics, all over the world the seven days have the same names. Slowly slowly, slight changes have happened down the centuries because people went very far away from the original source.\nFor example somwar – Monday. Som is the name in Sanskrit of the moon, and in English, monday is the day of the moon. How som became mon one never knows. Saturday is Sanskrit’s shaniwar. Shani is the name of Saturn; hence it became saturday. Sunday is the day of the sun. In Sanskrit it is raviwar. Ravi is the name of the sun.\nAll these names indicate that people at one time must have lived together and have carried fragments of those ancient days with them. All seven days can be found in Sanskrit; all ten digits can be found in Sanskrit – however they have changed, some trace... or if somebody is mad enough to go after them he can find exactly the whole sequence of change.\nFor example the English two. The Hindi do and the Sanskrit dwa are the same word. Just one word is missing which is twa; in Mongolian, it is twa. So from dwa to twa, from twa to two. It is not very difficult, these changes are very simple. The English three is Sanskrit tri – not much difference. The Hindi teen is not different; it is the same tri. And you can go on discovering. The English nine is sanskrit nav, is Hindi nau – in English, nine. These people must have lived together, then separated.\nSanskrit seems to be the original language of mankind. All languages of the world have a certain percentage of their basic roots in Sanskrit. You will be surprised... German has thirty percent of its roots, English has forty percent of its roots, Dutch has forty percent of its roots, Lithuanian has seventy percent of its roots – more than Hindi. They are all sister languages. All these people are coming from one source.\nBut the names are all arbitrary. They have no existential reality. It depends on you.\nThere have been mathematicians like Leibnitz who did not believe in ten digits. He worked out that three are enough and the whole mathematics can be done. It is hilarious to read Leibnitz because after three, four does not come. After three comes ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, twenty... But he has managed, there is no problem in it. It is fictitious.\nAlbert Einstein even tried to improve on Leibnitz. He says, “Two digits are essential, three are a little unnecessary. Just one and zero. And after one comes ten, eleven... and... I forget, but he has managed all his mathematical calculations with two digits.\nThere is no necessity that there should be only seven days. It depends on you.\nSo to me, it does not matter whether it is Friday or not. One thing is certain: every moment is Good, whether Jesus is crucified or not crucified. Here and now, life is blossoming, love is flowering. And there is so much – so many stars in the sky, so many trees with such colors, such depths of darkness, so many people with immense possibilities of consciousness... who cares about the past?\nGeorge Gurdjieff used to say that Jesus never happened; it is an old drama. Now what can you do? We know that for example in India, Ramayana, the story of Rama, is played every year all over the country in every village. It is conceivable that it may not be anything historical; Rama may not have ever existed. But the story is very ancient, and it has been played for so long, every year, again and again, that slowly a fictitious figure has become a historical figure.\nIt is a possibility. Except Gurdjieff, nobody has even raised the question. But a man like Gurdjieff has a clarity and intensity of seeing. He says, there is no mention of Jesus in any Jewish scripture. A man like Jesus – whom Jews could not tolerate alive, whom they had to crucify – is not even mentioned in any scripture, in any book. Jews don’t think that there has ever been any such person as Jesus. It was an old Jewish drama that a few people started taking seriously, and now on that fictitious drama, half of humanity has become Christian. Now if you go on digging deep, you will find simply a film story.\nBut there are many people who will waste their whole life looking towards the past. And in the same way your question, Dhyandeep, is about the future. “What will happen in the year 2017?”\nI am not a prophet and I don’t think there has ever been anybody who was a prophet, except frauds. In fact, it is very easy to say what will happen in 2017 or 13, or any year, when I will not be there to answer if it does not happen.\nWho cares? What can you do if it doesn’t happen? Nobody will bother that somebody has said something which has not happened. Or if it happens, then you will be too much involved in it. Who cares that fifty years before, somebody has said that it is going to happen?\nAs far as you are concerned, if you can learn to live here and now that is the most significant religious way of living. Silent and peaceful, joyful – if you can start living like the flowers and the birds, then if the whole world starts living in the same way perhaps nuclear weapons and nuclear wars will not happen.\nPeople who live peacefully here and now are not going to be involved in any kind of war, in any kind of destructiveness. The people of herenow are bound to be creative and loving. They will not be Christians and they will not be Hindus and they will not be Catholics and they will not be communists. They will not belong to any denomination, any nation, any race.\nThey will belong only to this moment.\nAnd they will rejoice so much in this moment that the whole existence will become a celebration, moment-to-moment celebration – a dance, a music, a poetry, a love affair.\nBut if you do not live here and now – and that’s what you are asking for, that “We are trying to live in the here and now, but nevertheless...” There is no question of, “but nevertheless we are sometimes thinking of the future.”\nWhy? What is the necessity of going on a holiday into the future? People think about the future only because the present is miserable. Then they think not only of this life and its future, they even think about what will happen after death.\nI have been traveling for thirty years and I have come across thousands of people who ask, “What will happen after death?”\nI have said, “Just die and see! It is not my problem, I am perfectly at ease. When I die, I will see what happens. But why should I die for you? And what is the guarantee that if I die, I will remember to tell you?”\nAt least up to now, nobody has remembered to give a phone call or just a telex saying that, “Don’t be worried, everything is good. God is still alive.”\nAll that can be done is hypothetical; your “sometimes thinking of the future” can only be hypothetical. What will happen tomorrow you cannot predict in any way. But one thing can be done: if you are joyous today, and you know the art of being joyful, if tomorrow ever comes you will still know how to be joyful and how to be festive and how to continue the celebration. If it does not come, it does not matter.\nJust think about one thing:\nHave you ever bothered about what was happening in the world when you were not yet born? Was there peace or war? Have you ever bothered whether things were going right or wrong before you were born? You have never bothered; that is not your concern. You were not here.\nIf the whole world disappears, then too there is no problem. The problem will be only for those who somehow don’t disappear in a nuclear war – and this is not possible, you cannot hide yourself anywhere.\nNuclear war is total war. All life on this earth will become impossible. Not even grass will grow. No man, no animals, no birds, no trees, no possibility for any living, breathing phenomenon after the nuclear war. So why worry about it?\nEither it will not happen... then enjoy while it has not happened. And I think 2017... that is still enough time to enjoy. And if it happens, then if it is true that you are only consciousness and the body is only an abode... nuclear weapons can destroy bodies. You will all be ghosts, so we will be meeting still. What is the problem? And that will be a very beautiful meeting, because it has not been known that ghosts become sick, that ghosts become old, that ghosts commit crimes, that ghosts murder each other, that ghosts become politicians, prime ministers, presidents. They don’t do these things. They really enjoy life, without any burden of children and a wife.\nIf the year 2017 is really going to evaporate the whole existence, I don’t see anything to be worried about. We are all going to die separately anyway, why not enjoy dying collectively? Once and forever, all friends, wife, children – all become ghosts. No question of shortage of food, all these things don’t matter. And if you don’t believe in ghosts... there may be a few; they are laughing, although they don’t know that many ghosts are sitting inside you, hiding here and there.\nI can indicate them to you – just touch somebody and if he laughs you can be certain. If there are no ghosts, then there is no problem either. There will be no meeting in Buddha Hall anymore. There will be silence; that’s what we are trying, to attain to silence. There will remain forever silence – no “Yaa-Hoo”... only silence.\nI don’t bother about the future.\nAnd you are asking, “What more can we do?” As if you are doing much! What are you doing? I don’t even know that you are doing something to prevent anything happening in 2017, and you are asking, “What more can we do so that you will be heard?”\nWhat is the need?\nIf people want to live, if people want existence to continue, life to remain, they will hear me. There is no need for you to become messengers and prophets, torturing people like Witnesses of Jehovah. Or harassing people like Hare Krishna people. Just if you want there to be more love and more peace in the world, you be peaceful and you be more loving. On your part, you should not contribute anything to destructiveness – by your jealousy, by your anger, by your greed. You should simply rejoice the moment that is available to you.\nIf your dance goes on spreading ripples, if your song is heard and echoed in faraway souls, if your silence attracts, becomes a magnetic force, that’s another thing. You are not doing anything, it is happening.\nBut if it is not happening, there is nothing to be worried about. It is not your problem. The people who will be here, at any point in the future... it will be their problem. You cannot solve it, you cannot change it. In fact, you cannot even envisage.…\nJust have a look. Do you think Gautam Buddha in his ultimate enlightenment could have conceived of railway trains? I am not talking about airplanes and rockets and nuclear weapons. Those are certainly big things. I am talking about small things. Do you think Gautam Buddha could have thought about a bicycle? With all his enlightenment, he could not have conceived that two wheels could possibly make a carriage. He had seen only four-wheeled carriages.\nAnd it is really a miracle! But you don’t understand, when you sit on a bicycle, you are doing a great miracle – against gravitation! He could not have conceived of it in any way. Small things, which you use every day, which you never think about – the greatest man of the past would not have been able to conceive of them. Just three hundred years ago it was not possible for anyone to think about railway trains or motorcars or airplanes.\nThe Wright brothers, two young men who first conceived the idea of flying, were thought by their village to be either idiots or mad. If God wanted man to fly he would have given wings; it is certainly not the intention of God. And those two brothers, the Wright brothers, were the sons of a poor man who used to sell bicycles, give bicycles on rent, a small mechanic.He was ashamed of his own sons: “You idiots, you should work with me and help in the shop. What do you go on doing, always in the basement?” In the basement, they were preparing the first airplane!\nBut they did not listen to anybody; they went on working, and just out of broken cycles, cycle parts, the first airplane was made. They could not even tell anybody that they had made the airplane. Deep in the night when the whole village was asleep, they took their great invention out in the fields to try it out. Because if they fail, then they will be condemned by everybody, laughed at.\nBut they managed, deep in the night, to fly their first airplane – a small-sized open airplane which could remain in the air only for thirty seconds, and then came down. But that was enough to prove the point that it was possible. If you can be thirty seconds in the air, you can be thirty minutes, thirty years! Then it is only a question of getting more and more sophisticated.\nNext day, they informed their father and the people of the village to come and see that what they had been thinking they could not do, they have done. Hundreds of people came. Hundreds did not; they thought, “They are idiots, don’t waste time. Who has ever heard of flying machines?” The word ‘airplane’ was not used – “flying machines.” But still a few people came to see and were amazed when they saw this small caricature of an airplane, made out of broken bicycle parts.\nAnd they had managed in the night to improve it so that it stays in the air for at least one minute. And it stayed, a hundred feet high, for one minute; the principle was proved. But nobody in the whole of history before those Wright brothers would have conceived that flying in the sky was possible.\nJust in this century, in the beginning of the century nobody thought that one day man would go to the moon, would walk on the moon. There is a Jaina monk who came here to see me. He is collecting money... and he has collected much money, because Jainas are rich people. Because it goes against Jaina scriptures that anybody can reach the moon: the moon is a god, it is not a planet, and you cannot walk on a god! That is inconceivable. God will throw you out into empty space and you will never be heard from again.\nSo this Jaina monk wants to prove that all these Russian astronauts, American astronauts, are all frauds; that they have been cheating the whole world by printing pictures of a man walking on the moon and he is not walking on the moon, he is walking somewhere in Siberia. They are bringing stones from the moon and they are not... those stones are from somewhere around the earth. And the pictures that show their rockets going to the moon are just photographic tricks.\nI told him, “You are unnecessarily wasting your time and the money of others.”\nHe said, “No, it is a question of immense importance. Our whole religion is at risk. If people start landing rockets on a god... and they will do all kinds of nasty things there. Naturally, they will have to piss. This kind of thing happening on a god?”\nI said, “This is right!” And he has a great file in which he is collecting all the pictures and things, and trying to prove that everything has been a deception.\nEven though man has walked on the moon, there are people who are not believing that he has done it.\nWhat will happen after thirty years is almost impossible to conceive. What I want to emphasize is that you should drop even thinking about the future. Your whole being should be involved in the present\nmoment. And if you can create a silent being, full of the song of existence and all the music and all the fragrance that comes from your innermost core, you have done more than can be expected of anyone.\nDon’t ask what more you can do. You just be yourself – know thyself – and your very vibe will start creating ripples around you. The more people become meditators in the world, the less is the possibility of any war, because who is going to fight? You and your children, you and your brothers and sisters? If more and more people are peaceful and really enjoy peace, they will simply refuse to participate in war or any kind of destructive activity.\nIt happened in the second world war that thirty percent of the American soldiers did not use weapons. They would go to the battlefield and throw bombs where there were no human beings. When it was discovered... it was a very strange phenomenon. Thirty percent is not a small percentage – one third. Those soldiers said, “We cannot kill human beings – it is so barbarous – but because we are paid and we are employed, we go to the war front and we have to do something...” So in the rivers, in the ocean somewhere they threw the bombs and in the evening they would come back.\nIf this is possible for thirty percent, why is it not possible for a hundred percent? And if a hundred percent of people simply refuse to be destructive... just Ronald Reagan or a few other idiots can have a boxing match in Moscow or in the White House, wherever they want. And the whole world can enjoy it on television.\nThere is no need to bother, to destroy. You can have a “World Conqueror” cup, so sometimes Gorbachev can have it, sometimes Ronald Reagan can have it. And every year the World Conqueror’s Boxing Match happens, everybody enjoys it, and there is no harm.\nIf you want it to be even more harmless, then let it be Indian style. American boxing is a little cruel and primitive, punching each other’s noses – that doesn’t look good. The Indian style of wrestling is far superior. It is an art. And if to this style, the Japanese mannerism is also added, it can become really a joyous day, a Good Friday! Every Good Friday, in different capitals of the world, just as the Olympic championship happens, let some idiot declare that he is the world conqueror. There is no harm. We can give him the trophy and he can keep it if he wins three times in a row. Otherwise, every year it goes to other conquerors.\nMake life a joy and a playfulness. Up to now, we have not been able to do it but now, we will be compelled to do it. Because up to now, we had not weapons enough to destroy all living beings, so partial wars were possible. For the first time, we are capable of destroying this earth seven thousand times. Each person we can kill seven thousand times, although ordinarily people die only one time. Except some few guys like Jesus, who resurrect... kill them again!\nI don’t think even Jesus will be able to manage to resurrect himself seven thousand times. And even if he manages, it will be a great event. Everybody will rejoice in it, and he will certainly prove that he is the only begotten son of God. But the truth is, just one time is enough. Because of this totality of war and the possibility of absolute destruction, this war cannot happen. Nobody is ready now; that’s why it goes on being postponed.\nSoon you will see: the same nuclear weapons and the same technology will be used for creative purposes – for creating more food, better clothes, better houses, more nourishment. Scientists say\nthey can – if war is stopped and the effort to manufacture war material is stopped – they can manage to support five times more people on this earth, living joyously, with a more healthy, longer life. It seems unbelievable but I can see the point that if war is not going to happen, then we have to do something with the war material that is accumulating in every nation. That war material has to be converted into creative resources.\nBut that is a question for the scientists. For you, the only thing to be done is to become a source of song and dance and beauty and love, and create as many ripples around you of your fragrance as you can.\nThe heart and its silence is as catching as anything else; it is contagious. We just want many many people to be silent, so they can spread this contagious health around the world. You don’t have to do anything else except change yourself as deeply as possible.\nJust a little realization, for which the time has come.…\nPaddy phones the police station one night to report that the steering wheel, brake pedal, accelerator and radio have been stolen from his car. The policeman says he will send a patrol car to investigate.\nA few minutes later Paddy is back on the phone. “Don’t bother about the patrol car,” he says, “I just realized I got in the back seat by mistake.”\nPaddy comes limping into the police station, covered in bruises, his clothes torn and dirty. “My mother-in-law just knocked me down with her car,” Paddy announces.\n“Are you really sure it was your mother-in-law?” asks the police officer. “Did you see her face?” “No, I didn’t see her face,” admits Paddy, “but I would recognize that laugh anywhere.”\nRonald Reagan is visiting a mental hospital to boost his public image. After touring the wards, he wanders into the garden where he gets into conversation with one of the gardeners.\nThe gardener turns out to be a very intelligent and interesting man and Reagan suggests that he must find work amongst so many insane people rather depressing.\n“Not at all,” replies the gardener, “You see, I am a patient myself.”\n“Amazing,” says Ronald Reagan, “you sound like one of the sanest people I have ever met.”\n“Well, it is true,” replies the gardener, “I have been trying to get them to release me for fifteen years.”\n“That’s outrageous!” cries Ronald, and he assures the gardener that he will do everything possible to get him released.\nThe gardener is very grateful and the two of them shake hands. As the president turns to go, the gardener picks up his shovel and with a mighty blow, knocks Reagan flat. Lying on the ground,\ndazed and astonished, Ronald Reagan watches in amazement as the gardener wags a finger at him and says, “Now, you won’t forget, will you?”\nJust don’t take it seriously.\n...2017... it is too far.\nMiss Goodbody tells her class that they are going to play a spelling game. Telling little Bobby to stand up, she asks, “What does your father do for a living? Say it nice and clearly. And then spell it out.”\n“My father is a baker,” says Bobby. “B-a-k-e-r.” “Good,” says Miss Goodbody, “now Cecily.”\n“Doctor: d-o-c-t-o-r,” says Cecily smugly and sits down. “Excellent,” says Miss Goodbody, “Now Herbie.”\nHerbie stands up and says, “Shipbuilder: s-h-i-t...” “No, Herbie,” says Miss Goodbody, “try again.” “Shipbuilder: s-h-i-t...”\n“No, no,” cries Miss Goodbody, “go to the blackboard and write it out and they will see your mistake!”\nAs Herbie heads for the front of the class, Little Ernie jumps up and says, “My dad is a gambler: g-a-m-b-l-e-r. And I will bet you five bucks that idiot puts shit on the board.”\nAfter three weeks of married life, Fagan Finkelstein makes the mistake of taking his young wife Rosa to one of the favorite discos from his bachelor days.\nRosa gets angry, as first the coat-check girl, then the barmaid, then the waitress – all of them pretty – welcome Fagan with great affection. But she gets really mad when a gorgeous blonde walks up to the table, sits for a moment in Fagan’s lap and kisses him on the cheek and says, “I will see you another night, darling, when you are not so busy.”\nRosa gets up from the table and heads for the door, closely followed by a protesting Fagan. They climb into a taxi with Fagan desperately trying to explain that the past is all behind him, and he loves only her.\n“Please, listen to me,” pleads Fagan. “No,” shouts Rosa, “I will not.”\nThe taxi driver looks round and says, “She is no good, Mr. Fink. Shall we go back and get another?” Okay, Maneesha?\nYes, Osho.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"5807","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/yaahoo_the_mystic_rose/part13/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/yaahoo_the_mystic_rose/>YAA-HOO!

POONA. BUT NEVERTHELESS WE SOMETIMES THINK OF THE FUTURE.</p><p><br></p><p>I ASK MYSELF, IF NOBODY ELSE HEARS YOUR VOICE EXCEPT US, WHAT WILL
HAPPEN IN THE YEAR 2017? WHAT MORE CAN WE DO SO THAT YOU WILL BE HEARD
AND THE BAD VISION OF THE YEAR 2017 THAT I HAVE WILL NOT HAPPEN?</p><p><br></p><p>Dhyandeep, the first thing to remember is: do not take anything
seriously. What happens in 2017 is not your concern. One thing is
certain: you will not be there. So who cares? Particularly herenow in
Poona! If by chance you are still alive – which is very much an
impossibility – still you will be living in the herenow. The years
change, the centuries change, but life is always here and now.</p><p><br></p><p>Wasting it in thinking about the past... and there are many who do
that. Just on my way here, Shunyo was saying, “Today is Friday...” I
don’t know, because what concern have I to remember which day it is, or
which year, or which century? I am herenow.</p><p><br></p><p>Her question was that “This is Friday; Jesus was crucified on this
day. Why is it called Good Friday?” As if, it seems, I have crucified
Jesus! I am not answerable at all. Naturally, the people who had
crucified Jesus must have celebrated. That was their goodbye to Jesus –
“We are finished with this guy who has been torturing us for so long.”
It is not a good thing, but it is not in my hands.</p><p>If it had been in my hands, Jesus needed psychiatric treatment. A
good body stretch until he had forgotten to say that “I am the only
begotten son of God.” Then it would certainly have been Good Friday
because then there would have been no Christianity. It is the
crucifixion which started the greatest criminal religion on the earth,
Christianity.</p><p><br></p><p>But the Jews were not so sophisticated that they could have tolerated
a young man, only thirty-three years of age, trotting on his donkey here
and there. Never went out of that small place, Judea. And he had a few
followers – every idiot can collect a dozen followers, and he had
exactly one dozen followers.</p><p><br></p><p>Those twelve idiots became twelve apostles, and they followed him
because they had no other business. They were not educated; not a single
one of them was cultured, educated, a rabbi, a learned man. None of them
had any knowledge of the scriptures. And on their own, they knew one
thing for certain, that they could not enter into paradise. They didn’t
have any qualifications. And this guy sitting on the donkey says, “If
you believe in me, I will take you into paradise.”</p><p><br></p><p>All those fools must have thought, “This is the simplest way. Rather
than becoming a rabbi, a great learned scholar, virtuous, a saint,
disciplining, torturing yourself... then, too, there is no certainty, no
guarantee. Nobody is saying to you that ‘I am responsible.’ At least
this guy says, ‘I am taking you. Just believe in me.’ And he is not
asking anything, not even any entry fee.” And who would not like to see
the scene without a ticket?</p><p><br></p><p>There were moments of doubt in their minds also, that God’s son
should not sit on a donkey. And they all knew that he was a carpenter’s
son, but what to do? He does not listen at all.</p><p><br></p><p>If people had simply tolerated him as a joke, which in fact he was –
a practical joke... People should have laughed. And he was bringing such
great news! They should have enjoyed, entertained him, but they were not
sophisticated enough. They took him too seriously.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what I am saying:</p><p><br></p><p>The most important thing is not to take anything seriously.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus took himself very seriously. Even when they were putting him on
the cross, he could have said, “Wait, I have changed my mind!” He
carried the joke too far. In his place, I should have certainly said, “I
have changed my mind.” A joke is a joke; one should not take it too
seriously.</p><p><br></p><p>And he would have left the Jews and the Romans who crucified him in a
very weird space: What to do? He has changed his mind! But he took
himself so seriously that he allowed them to put him on the cross, nail
him on the cross. Still, he was waiting for God and looking upwards. And
the sky by chance was completely empty.</p><p><br></p><p>His idea was that on a white cloud... Obviously, it has to be a white
cloud when God comes. He will come thundering and show all the Jews –
“You are stupid, you are killing my own son and you think you believe in
God?” But nothing seemed to happen.</p><p><br></p><p>Thousands of people had gathered to see – the one and only chance;
for the first time somebody has claimed to be the only begotten son. And
he was certainly serious because even on the cross</p><p>he did not just say, “It is enough. My father’s name is Joseph, my
mother’s name is Mary, and I don’t know who is this God.” He had enjoyed
enough, he was a celebrity in his own small country, but he waited.…</p><p><br></p><p>And the Jewish way of putting somebody on a cross is such that a
person can be alive on the cross at least forty-eight hours, because
they don’t kill you by breaking the neck. They kill you by nailing the
hands and the feet to the cross, so drop by drop the blood oozes out. It
is the most cruel and ugly way of taking revenge. But that was good in a
way; it gave forty-eight hours for the person to change his mind.</p><p><br></p><p>But Jesus wouldn’t change. On the contrary, he shouted at God!
Thousands of people are there, everybody wants to know God, to see God –
so much one has heard about God, and never a single witness. And this
great opportunity... people had come from faraway places.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus shouted at God – “Father!”... but he still did not forget to
call him “father.” He was really an absolute crackpot. “Father, have you
forgotten me? have you forsaken me? Why is the miracle not
happening?”</p><p><br></p><p>It was all his fiction – his God, who will descend on a white cloud;
that he will save him and show the world that Jesus is his only son,
“and anybody who wants to be saved from this miserable suffering life
and enter into the eternal bliss of paradise has to believe in my son.
He is my agent. You cannot directly contact me. Call him, and if he
chooses you will be allowed. Even on the Judgment Day when all the dead
of the past and the future will be raised from their graves...”</p><p><br></p><p>It is going to be a tremendous crowd. The world has never seen such a
crowd. I don’t think the earth can contain that much crowd. Five billion
people are alive today and man has existed for at least four million
years. The crowd will be so much, and Jesus will choose: “Who are my
people?”</p><p><br></p><p>But nothing happened. Fictions are fictions. There is no God and
there is no God’s son.</p><p>And all the messengers are megalomaniacs who need to be immediately
caught and treated before they get out of hand.</p><p><br></p><p>But they have founded religions, they have written great scriptures.
They have done such harm to humanity.</p><p><br></p><p>So there are many who are concerned about the past.…</p><p><br></p><p>Now Shunyo is asking, “Why is this day called Good Friday?” Good for
the Jews because they got rid of Jesus and good for Christians because
this is the beginning of their religion. But as far as we are concerned
it is just ordinary Friday. There is nothing special in it, neither good
nor bad.</p><p><br></p><p>And I am not at all certain whether it is Friday or not. I am simply
taking her question without giving my consent that this is Friday. In
fact, all these seven days and their names are our arbitrary names.
There is no existential reality behind them; it is not like the sun and
the moon and the earth. They</p><p>are just our ideas. They represent one thing certainly, that once
upon a time somewhere long past, thousands of years before, humanity
must have lived in a small tribe. And from that tribe people started to
grow more and more, and started spreading all over the earth. So a few
things they have carried from those days.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, every language has ten digits because man has ten
fingers. The primitive man counted everything on his fingers. Even I
myself count everything on my fingers. Then, too, I get lost after the
fourth because so many things come in between.</p><p><br></p><p>And just like the ten digits of language, of mathematics, all over
the world the seven days have the same names. Slowly slowly, slight
changes have happened down the centuries because people went very far
away from the original source.</p><p><br></p><p>For example somwar – Monday. Som is the name in Sanskrit of the moon,
and in English, monday is the day of the moon. How som became mon one
never knows. Saturday is Sanskrit’s shaniwar. Shani is the name of
Saturn; hence it became saturday. Sunday is the day of the sun. In
Sanskrit it is raviwar. Ravi is the name of the sun.</p><p><br></p><p>All these names indicate that people at one time must have lived
together and have carried fragments of those ancient days with them. All
seven days can be found in Sanskrit; all ten digits can be found in
Sanskrit – however they have changed, some trace... or if somebody is
mad enough to go after them he can find exactly the whole sequence of
change.</p><p><br></p><p>For example the English two. The Hindi do and the Sanskrit dwa are
the same word. Just one word is missing which is twa; in Mongolian, it
is twa. So from dwa to twa, from twa to two. It is not very difficult,
these changes are very simple. The English three is Sanskrit tri – not
much difference. The Hindi teen is not different; it is the same tri.
And you can go on discovering. The English nine is sanskrit nav, is
Hindi nau – in English, nine. These people must have lived together,
then separated.</p><p><br></p><p>Sanskrit seems to be the original language of mankind. All languages
of the world have a certain percentage of their basic roots in Sanskrit.
You will be surprised... German has thirty percent of its roots, English
has forty percent of its roots, Dutch has forty percent of its roots,
Lithuanian has seventy percent of its roots – more than Hindi. They are
all sister languages. All these people are coming from one source.</p><p><br></p><p>But the names are all arbitrary. They have no existential reality. It
depends on you.</p><p><br></p><p>There have been mathematicians like Leibnitz who did not believe in
ten digits. He worked out that three are enough and the whole
mathematics can be done. It is hilarious to read Leibnitz because after
three, four does not come. After three comes ten, eleven, twelve,
thirteen, twenty... But he has managed, there is no problem in it. It is
fictitious.</p><p><br></p><p>Albert Einstein even tried to improve on Leibnitz. He says, “Two
digits are essential, three are a little unnecessary. Just one and zero.
And after one comes ten, eleven... and... I forget, but he has managed
all his mathematical calculations with two digits.</p><p><br></p><p>There is no necessity that there should be only seven days. It
depends on you.</p><p>So to me, it does not matter whether it is Friday or not. One thing
is certain: every moment is Good, whether Jesus is crucified or not
crucified. Here and now, life is blossoming, love is flowering. And
there is so much – so many stars in the sky, so many trees with such
colors, such depths of darkness, so many people with immense
possibilities of consciousness... who cares about the past?</p><p><br></p><p>George Gurdjieff used to say that Jesus never happened; it is an old
drama. Now what can you do? We know that for example in India, Ramayana,
the story of Rama, is played every year all over the country in every
village. It is conceivable that it may not be anything historical; Rama
may not have ever existed. But the story is very ancient, and it has
been played for so long, every year, again and again, that slowly a
fictitious figure has become a historical figure.</p><p><br></p><p>It is a possibility. Except Gurdjieff, nobody has even raised the
question. But a man like Gurdjieff has a clarity and intensity of
seeing. He says, there is no mention of Jesus in any Jewish scripture. A
man like Jesus – whom Jews could not tolerate alive, whom they had to
crucify – is not even mentioned in any scripture, in any book. Jews
don’t think that there has ever been any such person as Jesus. It was an
old Jewish drama that a few people started taking seriously, and now on
that fictitious drama, half of humanity has become Christian. Now if you
go on digging deep, you will find simply a film story.</p><p><br></p><p>But there are many people who will waste their whole life looking
towards the past. And in the same way your question, Dhyandeep, is about
the future. “What will happen in the year 2017?”</p><p><br></p><p>I am not a prophet and I don’t think there has ever been anybody who
was a prophet, except frauds. In fact, it is very easy to say what will
happen in 2017 or 13, or any year, when I will not be there to answer if
it does not happen.</p><p><br></p><p>Who cares? What can you do if it doesn’t happen? Nobody will bother
that somebody has said something which has not happened. Or if it
happens, then you will be too much involved in it. Who cares that fifty
years before, somebody has said that it is going to happen?</p><p><br></p><p>As far as you are concerned, if you can learn to live here and now
that is the most significant religious way of living. Silent and
peaceful, joyful – if you can start living like the flowers and the
birds, then if the whole world starts living in the same way perhaps
nuclear weapons and nuclear wars will not happen.</p><p><br></p><p>People who live peacefully here and now are not going to be involved
in any kind of war, in any kind of destructiveness. The people of
herenow are bound to be creative and loving. They will not be Christians
and they will not be Hindus and they will not be Catholics and they will
not be communists. They will not belong to any denomination, any nation,
any race.</p><p><br></p><p>They will belong only to this moment.</p><p><br></p><p>And they will rejoice so much in this moment that the whole existence
will become a celebration, moment-to-moment celebration – a dance, a
music, a poetry, a love affair.</p><p><br></p><p>But if you do not live here and now – and that’s what you are asking
for, that “We are trying to live in the here and now, but
nevertheless...” There is no question of, “but nevertheless we are
sometimes thinking of the future.”</p><p>Why? What is the necessity of going on a holiday into the future?
People think about the future only because the present is miserable.
Then they think not only of this life and its future, they even think
about what will happen after death.</p><p><br></p><p>I have been traveling for thirty years and I have come across
thousands of people who ask, “What will happen after death?”</p><p><br></p><p>I have said, “Just die and see! It is not my problem, I am perfectly
at ease. When I die, I will see what happens. But why should I die for
you? And what is the guarantee that if I die, I will remember to tell
you?”</p><p><br></p><p>At least up to now, nobody has remembered to give a phone call or
just a telex saying that, “Don’t be worried, everything is good. God is
still alive.”</p><p><br></p><p>All that can be done is hypothetical; your “sometimes thinking of the
future” can only be hypothetical. What will happen tomorrow you cannot
predict in any way. But one thing can be done: if you are joyous today,
and you know the art of being joyful, if tomorrow ever comes you will
still know how to be joyful and how to be festive and how to continue
the celebration. If it does not come, it does not matter.</p><p><br></p><p>Just think about one thing:</p><p><br></p><p>Have you ever bothered about what was happening in the world when you
were not yet born? Was there peace or war? Have you ever bothered
whether things were going right or wrong before you were born? You have
never bothered; that is not your concern. You were not here.</p><p><br></p><p>If the whole world disappears, then too there is no problem. The
problem will be only for those who somehow don’t disappear in a nuclear
war – and this is not possible, you cannot hide yourself anywhere.</p><p><br></p><p>Nuclear war is total war. All life on this earth will become
impossible. Not even grass will grow. No man, no animals, no birds, no
trees, no possibility for any living, breathing phenomenon after the
nuclear war. So why worry about it?</p><p><br></p><p>Either it will not happen... then enjoy while it has not happened.
And I think 2017... that is still enough time to enjoy. And if it
happens, then if it is true that you are only consciousness and the body
is only an abode... nuclear weapons can destroy bodies. You will all be
ghosts, so we will be meeting still. What is the problem? And that will
be a very beautiful meeting, because it has not been known that ghosts
become sick, that ghosts become old, that ghosts commit crimes, that
ghosts murder each other, that ghosts become politicians, prime
ministers, presidents. They don’t do these things. They really enjoy
life, without any burden of children and a wife.</p><p><br></p><p>If the year 2017 is really going to evaporate the whole existence, I
don’t see anything to be worried about. We are all going to die
separately anyway, why not enjoy dying collectively? Once and forever,
all friends, wife, children – all become ghosts. No question of shortage
of food, all these things don’t matter. And if you don’t believe in
ghosts... there may be a few; they are laughing, although they don’t
know that many ghosts are sitting inside you, hiding here and there.</p><p>I can indicate them to you – just touch somebody and if he laughs you
can be certain. If there are no ghosts, then there is no problem either.
There will be no meeting in Buddha Hall anymore. There will be silence;
that’s what we are trying, to attain to silence. There will remain
forever silence – no “Yaa-Hoo”... only silence.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t bother about the future.</p><p><br></p><p>And you are asking, “What more can we do?” As if you are doing much!
What are you doing? I don’t even know that you are doing something to
prevent anything happening in 2017, and you are asking, “What more can
we do so that you will be heard?”</p><p><br></p><p>What is the need?</p><p><br></p><p>If people want to live, if people want existence to continue, life to
remain, they will hear me. There is no need for you to become messengers
and prophets, torturing people like Witnesses of Jehovah. Or harassing
people like Hare Krishna people. Just if you want there to be more love
and more peace in the world, you be peaceful and you be more loving. On
your part, you should not contribute anything to destructiveness – by
your jealousy, by your anger, by your greed. You should simply rejoice
the moment that is available to you.</p><p><br></p><p>If your dance goes on spreading ripples, if your song is heard and
echoed in faraway souls, if your silence attracts, becomes a magnetic
force, that’s another thing. You are not doing anything, it is
happening.</p><p><br></p><p>But if it is not happening, there is nothing to be worried about. It
is not your problem. The people who will be here, at any point in the
future... it will be their problem. You cannot solve it, you cannot
change it. In fact, you cannot even envisage.…</p><p><br></p><p>Just have a look. Do you think Gautam Buddha in his ultimate
enlightenment could have conceived of railway trains? I am not talking
about airplanes and rockets and nuclear weapons. Those are certainly big
things. I am talking about small things. Do you think Gautam Buddha
could have thought about a bicycle? With all his enlightenment, he could
not have conceived that two wheels could possibly make a carriage. He
had seen only four-wheeled carriages.</p><p><br></p><p>And it is really a miracle! But you don’t understand, when you sit on
a bicycle, you are doing a great miracle – against gravitation! He could
not have conceived of it in any way. Small things, which you use every
day, which you never think about – the greatest man of the past would
not have been able to conceive of them. Just three hundred years ago it
was not possible for anyone to think about railway trains or motorcars
or airplanes.</p><p><br></p><p>The Wright brothers, two young men who first conceived the idea of
flying, were thought by their village to be either idiots or mad. If God
wanted man to fly he would have given wings; it is certainly not the
intention of God. And those two brothers, the Wright brothers, were the
sons of a poor man who used to sell bicycles, give bicycles on rent, a
small mechanic.He was ashamed of his own sons: “You idiots, you should
work with me and help in the shop. What do you go on doing, always in
the basement?” In the basement, they were preparing the first
airplane!</p><p>But they did not listen to anybody; they went on working, and just
out of broken cycles, cycle parts, the first airplane was made. They
could not even tell anybody that they had made the airplane. Deep in the
night when the whole village was asleep, they took their great invention
out in the fields to try it out. Because if they fail, then they will be
condemned by everybody, laughed at.</p><p><br></p><p>But they managed, deep in the night, to fly their first airplane – a
small-sized open airplane which could remain in the air only for thirty
seconds, and then came down. But that was enough to prove the point that
it was possible. If you can be thirty seconds in the air, you can be
thirty minutes, thirty years! Then it is only a question of getting more
and more sophisticated.</p><p><br></p><p>Next day, they informed their father and the people of the village to
come and see that what they had been thinking they could not do, they
have done. Hundreds of people came. Hundreds did not; they thought,
“They are idiots, don’t waste time. Who has ever heard of flying
machines?” The word ‘airplane’ was not used – “flying machines.” But
still a few people came to see and were amazed when they saw this small
caricature of an airplane, made out of broken bicycle parts.</p><p><br></p><p>And they had managed in the night to improve it so that it stays in
the air for at least one minute. And it stayed, a hundred feet high, for
one minute; the principle was proved. But nobody in the whole of history
before those Wright brothers would have conceived that flying in the sky
was possible.</p><p><br></p><p>Just in this century, in the beginning of the century nobody thought
that one day man would go to the moon, would walk on the moon. There is
a Jaina monk who came here to see me. He is collecting money... and he
has collected much money, because Jainas are rich people. Because it
goes against Jaina scriptures that anybody can reach the moon: the moon
is a god, it is not a planet, and you cannot walk on a god! That is
inconceivable. God will throw you out into empty space and you will
never be heard from again.</p><p><br></p><p>So this Jaina monk wants to prove that all these Russian astronauts,
American astronauts, are all frauds; that they have been cheating the
whole world by printing pictures of a man walking on the moon and he is
not walking on the moon, he is walking somewhere in Siberia. They are
bringing stones from the moon and they are not... those stones are from
somewhere around the earth. And the pictures that show their rockets
going to the moon are just photographic tricks.</p><p><br></p><p>I told him, “You are unnecessarily wasting your time and the money of
others.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “No, it is a question of immense importance. Our whole
religion is at risk. If people start landing rockets on a god... and
they will do all kinds of nasty things there. Naturally, they will have
to piss. This kind of thing happening on a god?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “This is right!” And he has a great file in which he is
collecting all the pictures and things, and trying to prove that
everything has been a deception.</p><p><br></p><p>Even though man has walked on the moon, there are people who are not
believing that he has done it.</p><p><br></p><p>What will happen after thirty years is almost impossible to conceive.
What I want to emphasize is that you should drop even thinking about the
future. Your whole being should be involved in the present</p><p>moment. And if you can create a silent being, full of the song of
existence and all the music and all the fragrance that comes from your
innermost core, you have done more than can be expected of anyone.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t ask what more you can do. You just be yourself – know thyself –
and your very vibe will start creating ripples around you. The more
people become meditators in the world, the less is the possibility of
any war, because who is going to fight? You and your children, you and
your brothers and sisters? If more and more people are peaceful and
really enjoy peace, they will simply refuse to participate in war or any
kind of destructive activity.</p><p><br></p><p>It happened in the second world war that thirty percent of the
American soldiers did not use weapons. They would go to the battlefield
and throw bombs where there were no human beings. When it was
discovered... it was a very strange phenomenon. Thirty percent is not a
small percentage – one third. Those soldiers said, “We cannot kill human
beings – it is so barbarous – but because we are paid and we are
employed, we go to the war front and we have to do something...” So in
the rivers, in the ocean somewhere they threw the bombs and in the
evening they would come back.</p><p><br></p><p>If this is possible for thirty percent, why is it not possible for a
hundred percent? And if a hundred percent of people simply refuse to be
destructive... just Ronald Reagan or a few other idiots can have a
boxing match in Moscow or in the White House, wherever they want. And
the whole world can enjoy it on television.</p><p><br></p><p>There is no need to bother, to destroy. You can have a “World
Conqueror” cup, so sometimes Gorbachev can have it, sometimes Ronald
Reagan can have it. And every year the World Conqueror’s Boxing Match
happens, everybody enjoys it, and there is no harm.</p><p><br></p><p>If you want it to be even more harmless, then let it be Indian style.
American boxing is a little cruel and primitive, punching each other’s
noses – that doesn’t look good. The Indian style of wrestling is far
superior. It is an art. And if to this style, the Japanese mannerism is
also added, it can become really a joyous day, a Good Friday! Every Good
Friday, in different capitals of the world, just as the Olympic
championship happens, let some idiot declare that he is the world
conqueror. There is no harm. We can give him the trophy and he can keep
it if he wins three times in a row. Otherwise, every year it goes to
other conquerors.</p><p><br></p><p>Make life a joy and a playfulness. Up to now, we have not been able
to do it but now, we will be compelled to do it. Because up to now, we
had not weapons enough to destroy all living beings, so partial wars
were possible. For the first time, we are capable of destroying this
earth seven thousand times. Each person we can kill seven thousand
times, although ordinarily people die only one time. Except some few
guys like Jesus, who resurrect... kill them again!</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t think even Jesus will be able to manage to resurrect himself
seven thousand times. And even if he manages, it will be a great event.
Everybody will rejoice in it, and he will certainly prove that he is the
only begotten son of God. But the truth is, just one time is enough.
Because of this totality of war and the possibility of absolute
destruction, this war cannot happen. Nobody is ready now; that’s why it
goes on being postponed.</p><p><br></p><p>Soon you will see: the same nuclear weapons and the same technology
will be used for creative purposes – for creating more food, better
clothes, better houses, more nourishment. Scientists say</p><p>they can – if war is stopped and the effort to manufacture war
material is stopped – they can manage to support five times more people
on this earth, living joyously, with a more healthy, longer life. It
seems unbelievable but I can see the point that if war is not going to
happen, then we have to do something with the war material that is
accumulating in every nation. That war material has to be converted into
creative resources.</p><p><br></p><p>But that is a question for the scientists. For you, the only thing to
be done is to become a source of song and dance and beauty and love, and
create as many ripples around you of your fragrance as you can.</p><p><br></p><p>The heart and its silence is as catching as anything else; it is
contagious. We just want many many people to be silent, so they can
spread this contagious health around the world. You don’t have to do
anything else except change yourself as deeply as possible.</p><p><br></p><p>Just a little realization, for which the time has come.…</p><p><br></p><p>Paddy phones the police station one night to report that the steering
wheel, brake pedal, accelerator and radio have been stolen from his car.
The policeman says he will send a patrol car to investigate.</p><p><br></p><p>A few minutes later Paddy is back on the phone. “Don’t bother about
the patrol car,” he says, “I just realized I got in the back seat by
mistake.”</p><p><br></p><p>Paddy comes limping into the police station, covered in bruises, his
clothes torn and dirty. “My mother-in-law just knocked me down with her
car,” Paddy announces.</p><p>“Are you really sure it was your mother-in-law?” asks the police
officer. “Did you see her face?” “No, I didn’t see her face,” admits
Paddy, “but I would recognize that laugh anywhere.”</p><p>Ronald Reagan is visiting a mental hospital to boost his public
image. After touring the wards, he wanders into the garden where he gets
into conversation with one of the gardeners.</p><p><br></p><p>The gardener turns out to be a very intelligent and interesting man
and Reagan suggests that he must find work amongst so many insane people
rather depressing.</p><p><br></p><p>“Not at all,” replies the gardener, “You see, I am a patient
myself.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Amazing,” says Ronald Reagan, “you sound like one of the sanest
people I have ever met.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, it is true,” replies the gardener, “I have been trying to get
them to release me for fifteen years.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s outrageous!” cries Ronald, and he assures the gardener that
he will do everything possible to get him released.</p><p><br></p><p>The gardener is very grateful and the two of them shake hands. As the
president turns to go, the gardener picks up his shovel and with a
mighty blow, knocks Reagan flat. Lying on the ground,</p><p>dazed and astonished, Ronald Reagan watches in amazement as the
gardener wags a finger at him and says, “Now, you won’t forget, will
you?”</p><p>Just don’t take it seriously.</p><p><br></p><p>...2017... it is too far.</p><p><br></p><p>Miss Goodbody tells her class that they are going to play a spelling
game. Telling little Bobby to stand up, she asks, “What does your father
do for a living? Say it nice and clearly. And then spell it out.”</p><p>“My father is a baker,” says Bobby. “B-a-k-e-r.” “Good,” says Miss
Goodbody, “now Cecily.”</p><p>“Doctor: d-o-c-t-o-r,” says Cecily smugly and sits down. “Excellent,”
says Miss Goodbody, “Now Herbie.”</p><p>Herbie stands up and says, “Shipbuilder: s-h-i-t...” “No, Herbie,”
says Miss Goodbody, “try again.” “Shipbuilder: s-h-i-t...”</p><p>“No, no,” cries Miss Goodbody, “go to the blackboard and write it out
and they will see your mistake!”</p><p><br></p><p>As Herbie heads for the front of the class, Little Ernie jumps up and
says, “My dad is a gambler: g-a-m-b-l-e-r. And I will bet you five bucks
that idiot puts shit on the board.”</p><p>After three weeks of married life, Fagan Finkelstein makes the
mistake of taking his young wife Rosa to one of the favorite discos from
his bachelor days.</p><p>Rosa gets angry, as first the coat-check girl, then the barmaid, then
the waitress – all of them pretty – welcome Fagan with great affection.
But she gets really mad when a gorgeous blonde walks up to the table,
sits for a moment in Fagan’s lap and kisses him on the cheek and says,
“I will see you another night, darling, when you are not so busy.”</p><p>Rosa gets up from the table and heads for the door, closely followed
by a protesting Fagan. They climb into a taxi with Fagan desperately
trying to explain that the past is all behind him, and he loves only
her.</p><p>“Please, listen to me,” pleads Fagan. “No,” shouts Rosa, “I will
not.”</p><p>The taxi driver looks round and says, “She is no good, Mr. Fink.
Shall we go back and get another?” Okay, Maneesha?</p><p>Yes, Osho.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part12>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

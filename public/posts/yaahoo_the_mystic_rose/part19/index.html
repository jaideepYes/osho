IS IT SOMETHING BELONGING TO THE PHYSICAL MONKEY BRAIN? OR IS IT SOMETHING OF THE UNIVERSAL MIND, WHICH I AM ASSUMING IS MY OWN HIGHER MIND?\nALSO, IF IT IS NOT OF THE PHYSICAL BRAIN, THEN IS THIS WHY IT IS A WASTE OF TIME TO ATTEMPT TO END YOUR SUFFERING BY PUTTING A BULLET THROUGH YOUR BRAIN?\nPrem Sakino, the question that you have asked implies almost the whole psychology of man. In one way, man is divided into the body, the physiology, and the mind, the psychology. The brain is part of the body; mind is the psychology – another name of psychology. They both belong to something else – a deeper and higher consciousness, a universal consciousness. But the state of the mind is very complex; it is almost like a bridge between the soul, the universal, and the body, the individual.\nWhen the body dies the mind continues, as a wavelength of memories, with the conscious soul. It will enter into new bodies; it will gather more experiences, sufferings, joys. And through many lives, mind goes on collecting. Each body allows it to have sufferings or blessings – but slowly slowly, if it goes again and again into pain, misery, agony, it becomes habitual for the mind that whichever body it may have, it will fall into painful experiences.\nThe mind also dies one day.\nBody dies many times; mind dies only once.\nThe day mind dies, you enter into the world of immortality, the universal. That’s what we call enlightenment.\nUntil the mind dies, it remains the master; it does not accept being a slave. The moment your innermost being asserts, that very assertion becomes the death of the mind. Hence, meditation is defined as no-mind.\nIt does not mean that the mind is not there; it simply means the mastery of the mind is no longer there. It can still be used as a vehicle, just like a flute, but the song is not of the flute. And the flute cannot sing on its own – the flute is only a passage; it gives way.\nA man of no-mind also uses the mind when he speaks, but just like the song of the flute.\nOne of the most cherished books of Hindus, SHRIMAD BHAGAVADGITA, is very strange in the sense that it is called “the song of the divine.” Just its title is so significant; from the very title it means that the words are used not by the mind but by someone who has no mind.\nIn the East we never developed any psychology. This is one of the most important differences that has grown between East and West. In the East we have developed techniques and methods to go beyond mind; in the West the philosopher, the thinker, has become too much involved in the mechanics of the mind: what is mind?\nIt is so surprising that for ten thousand years in the East, which has been continuously concerned with the inner search, nobody has bothered about what mind is. If you can drop it, drop it, because all that is real and authentic and true is beyond it. Why waste time with something which is ephemeral?\nBut the whole of Western psychology is concerned with the ephemeral. The psychologist is concerned with dreams. It is not just symbolic – he is actually concerned with a bigger dream called the mind. And by trying to look into dreams, the psychologist is trying to figure out the functioning of the mind.\nWhy does he have to go to the dreams? Why can he not rely upon your waking hours?\nYour waking hours are fake. You say things which you don’t mean. Perhaps you don’t intend to deceive anyone, but your very upbringing is such that you are bound to deceive. Your every gesture is political, is diplomatic. You are trying to influence the other person, you are trying to convert the other person. You are trying, in short, to exploit the other person’s gullibility. You are not saying what is true, you are saying what people want to hear.\nIn each church, in each temple, in each synagogue, all the sermons are simply what people want to hear. They are opium for the people, they are consolations for people. People are in misery, people are in suffering, but this suffering humanity becomes a great marketplace for those who can exploit – in the name of compassion, in the name of God.\nThey don’t remove your suffering – they can’t remove it, it is beyond their power. But they can console you. They can make you feel at ease with your agony; they can give you a dose of opium so\nthat you can go on living with all the suffering, all the pain, without even bothering about it, without even thinking about it.\nHence, when you say something, it is not reliable. It may be true, it may not be true. The psychologist has to go into your dreams because your dreams have not been polluted by the priests, by the politicians, by the educationists.\nThey are trying.\nThey are developing in the Soviet Union and in America both, techniques for teaching people while they are asleep. Once those techniques are refined, man will lose all freedom. Anyway, he is not free – freedom is only a beautiful word, corresponding to no reality. But a small freedom is there: you can dream your dream without any fear of the neighbors, without any fear of the government, without any fear of anybody – the parents, the teachers, the vested interests.\nDreaming is the only freedom. It is such a sad statement that I am making, that you have only dreams where you are free. Otherwise, you are not free; your freedom is just a show. Everybody is in chains, but the chains are invisible.\nThe psychologist has to enter into your dreams so that he can find out who you are. On the surface you are a celibate, a Catholic monk. But do you think in the dreams also you are a Catholic and a celibate and a monk? Most probably you are just the opposite of what you are pretending to be when you are awake. Your whole wakefulness has been so polluted, so dominated, so conditioned by others that you don’t even know that what you are saying is not your own voice. It may be Voice of America or it may be voice of anybody else, but it is not your voice.\nSometimes, watch whatever you say or do: is it authentically yours? Or has somebody put it in your mind just like things are fed to a computer? – your mother, your father... they were all well-wishers but ignorant, utterly ignorant as far as self-knowledge is concerned. They have made you Christians and Hindus and Mohammedans and communists. And they have created a world which is, as far as consciousness is concerned, absolutely contaminated, divided, a thousand and one discriminations.\nBut it is only a thin layer. Underneath this thin layer is a vast unconscious. This unconscious is all that has been repressed and not allowed expression.\nEverybody can remember hearing the parents say, “Don’t say that, never say that! It is against civilization, culture; it is against respectability, honor. Never mention it.” And slowly slowly, when again and again it is said, you start pressing it deeper into your being. That which has been repressed in you is your unconscious.\nA man like Gautam Buddha has no unconscious. A man who is fully awakened is simply pure consciousness. He does not dream, there is no need for him to dream. He is living his life with all its dangers, risks, the way he wants to live. He is not in any way following anybody against himself.\nHe is not a hypocrite, a pretender, an actor, repeating like a parrot either what he has been told by religions or by politicians or by other vested interests: “You have to be like this and you have to be like that.” Everything... how to sit, how to stand up, how to walk. So many chains and so many\nlocks on your mouth that you cannot say a single word that arises within you, not a single flower that blossoms in your consciousness.\nThis repressed part of your being creates the unconscious.\nYou are asking, “What exactly is this unconscious mind which is also called the dark night of the soul?” It is your repressed mind, centuries old, of many lives. Each time you change the body, your unconscious mind becomes bigger because more repressions are added to it.\nYou will be surprised that you are not at all aware of what is contained within you, in your own house.\nA Zen master, one dark night, was sleeping in his small hut. He had only one woolen blanket, but he was awake and he saw a thief entering in. He felt very sorry for the thief because he knew perfectly well that in his house there was nothing; for thirty years he had been searching. But who knows? This man may be able to find something.\nSo he got up slowly, lit a small candle, and went behind the thief. The thief looked at him, utterly frozen – “My god, that man I was thinking was either dead or asleep is coming – naked because he has only one blanket – with a candle!” Just think of yourself.…\nBut the Zen monk said to the thief, “Don’t be worried and don’t feel in any way offended. I am a poor man, I have only one blanket. So don’t be worried. And in this night, dark night and far away from the village, nobody will know what we are doing here.”\nThe thief said, “What are we doing?”\nThe master said, “The same thing that you are doing!”\nThe thief said, “You are a strange man. I am a thief; I am looking for something.”\nHe said, “That’s what I say! For thirty years I am also looking for something, but in this house there is nothing. So let us make a contract: if we find something, we will divide it.”\nThe thief said, “My god! You are the owner of this house...”\nHe said, “I am not the owner of this house. Somebody was, but he is dead. I found this hut and seeing that nobody is living here, I started living here thirty years ago. Since then I have been searching – something must be somewhere; that old man cannot have taken away all the things with him. In fact, in death nobody can take away anything.”\nThe thief said, “The morning is coming close and I have not come here to discuss great matters, death, and whether somebody can take anything beyond death or not. You just please let me go.”\nThe master said, “But what about the search? Have I to search my whole life alone? Won’t you give me a hand?”\nThe thief said, “I pray... just let me get out! If people find me here in the morning, there is bound to be trouble.”\nThat Zen monk said, “There will be no trouble at all, because for thirty years I have been waiting. Nobody comes here. Let us just have a good dialogue, and in the morning we can search better, more light, and maybe we can find something. And we can become partners! If you find something in somebody else’s house, half will be mine and half will be yours.” He said, “You are a religious man – are you joking? Are you absolutely mad? Making a contract with a thief... people think you are a saint!”\nThe monk said, “That is true. People think I am a saint, but I don’t have anything other than the blanket. If you don’t want to divide the blanket in two parts, you can take it home.”\nAnd he gave the blanket to the thief. The thief just could not believe what was happening and he ran out. As he was going out, the monk shouted, “Come back and close the door! And always remember: when somebody gives you something, at least say thank you. Learn manners!”\nThe thief said, “Thank you,” and closed the door. And the monk said, “Remember – this ‘thank you’ will help you go a long way.”\nAfter two years, the thief was arrested for stealing in some other house, caught red-handed. In the court, the magistrate asked him, “Can you give some reference, anybody who knows you?”\nHe remembered that poor man, so beautiful and so lovely and so nice. He said, “Yes, I know one Zen monk who lives outside the town.”\nThe magistrate said, “That will do. If that monk – I know him – if he can say anything in favor of you, you will be released.”\nThe monk was called and he was asked about the thief. The monk said, “This man is a very beautiful, simple man. One night, by mistake he entered into my house.”\nThe magistrate said, “What do you mean, ‘by mistake’?”\n“I said ‘by mistake’ because the doors were open and everybody knows that there is nothing in that hut but me and my blanket. And I offered my blanket to him. He was a guest. He tried not to take it, I had almost to force him. And he is so mannerly that he said to me, ‘Thank you, sir’ and he closed the door. This man is a very nice man, you should not harass him.”\nBecause that monk said, “You should not harass him,” the thief was released. He could not believe it! Neither did he understand that night, nor could he understand the saint’s statements in court in his favor. He followed the saint.\nThe monk said, “Are you coming now?” He said, “Yes, I am coming now.”\nHe said, “You unnecessarily wasted two years. I was telling you to get into a partnership from the very beginning. You had nothing to lose; I lost my blanket. Now what do you want?”\nHe said, “Now I want to be in your service, to sit by your side and listen to what you are saying. Now I can see that you are not an ordinary man; that you don’t belong to the masses and the crowd, that you are utterly different.”\nThe Zen monk said, “If you can see the difference, then you are accepted. Be my fellow traveler. I was so sad that night when you could not find anything in the house. You had given me so much respect by entering my hut, because who enters poor people’s huts? People go to steal in palaces. You raised my status to a king, I was grateful. But I had nothing else to give to you but an old blanket, and when you left I wept because, ‘If that man had told me a few days before, I could have collected some things.’\n“And sitting on my window sill, I saw the moon in the sky and I wrote a poem. I have not told anybody, but with you I will share it. It is a beautiful poem. It says: My heart weeps, cries, because I could not offer a guest anything worthwhile. If it were in my power, I would have given him the whole moon. But the moon is not in my power.”\nIt is a beautiful piece. Such a man has no unconscious at all. It is pure consciousness.\nYou are asking, “Is it something belonging to the physical monkey brain?” Ordinarily yes. Ordinarily your mind belongs to your body because it is nothing but the functioning of your brain, which is part of the body. But the whole effort of meditation is to take it away from the body, to take it away from the brain, purify it from all that gives it limitations – of Hinduism, Mohammedanism, of man, of woman, of all kinds of inferiorities, superiorities. To take it away from all that towards nothingness, towards a silence, towards a peace that passeth understanding... then it is not part of the brain; then it becomes part of the universal consciousness.\nThat’s what you are saying: “Or is it something of the universal mind?” Ordinarily, no. Extraordinarily, yes.\nYou are saying, “... which I am assuming is my own higher mind.” Yes, it is your own higher mind, but there is no you. It is simply pure awareness with no ‘I’ and with no ‘you’ – just a mirror, reflecting.\nAnd finally, you are asking, “If it is not of the physical brain, then is this why it is a waste of time to attempt to end your suffering by putting a bullet through your brain?”\nPrem Sakino, it is not only a waste of time putting a bullet through your brain, it is again creating more unconsciousness. By suicide, nobody can become enlightened. By suicide, one is born again more deeply rooted in agony. The agony of suicide follows into the next life, the following life.\nSo it is certainly a waste of a bullet, and immensely harmful to your future life.\nIf it were so simple to become enlightened by putting a bullet in the brain, there would have been millions of enlightened people. But enlightenment has to be earned. It has to be deserved.\nIt is a strange phenomenon because in a sense, it is already yours, and in a sense you have to find it. It is hidden inside your being.\nNo bullet can reach there, but you can reach.\nYou can reach just by being silent and more silent. As the silence deepens, you are coming closer and closer to a light which is your ultimate source of life.\nYes, you will be burned; as an individual entity you will be no more. But as a universal being, as a whole cosmos, you will be.\nAnd that is the only blissful state. Other than that, you never know what bliss is. It is not pleasure; pleasure is not even something like a faraway cousin. You cannot understand bliss by measuring it in terms of pleasure. Pleasure is almost like scratching: it feels good, but after a while it hurts. Because you have scratched too much, blood starts coming. What you call pleasure is nothing but scratching.\nBlissfulness has nothing to do with you; blissfulness is your very nature. You simply relax into yourself, to the deepest rock bottom of your being...\nAnd you are light and you are truth, and you are beauty and you are love, and you are all that one can desire. The glory, the splendor of the whole existence is yours.\nBut you are not there. Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nSINCE I FIRST MET YOU ALMOST TEN YEARS AGO, I COULD NOT DO ANYTHING BUT FOLLOW YOUR STEPS AND BE WITH YOU.\nIT FELT LIKE WITHDRAWING FROM THE WORLD TO LEARN TO KNOW MYSELF. AS I BECAME MORE AWARE OF MYSELF I BECAME MORE SENSITIVE, BUT DETACHED AND COOL.\nBELOVED MASTER, AM I BEFOOLING MYSELF, AS I FEEL IT IS NOW TIME FOR ME TO GO AND LEARN WITH THE ARROWSMITH WOMAN IN THE MARKETPLACE...?\nGovindo, you need not befool with any arrowsmith woman. A real woman is sitting in front of me! I offer to introduce you to this woman. You will not find such a woman anywhere in the world; with a small beard, a beautiful mustache... And really looking beautiful!\nI wonder, why has Vimal not been using this dress from the very beginning? After I have left, you all have to see her – I really mean her, it is not a mistake – and rejoice in a real woman.\nWhere are you going? – on a rented bicycle, to some arrowsmith woman! Can’t you find any woman here? If you cannot find someone to love here, you will not find any-where. Because it is not a question of someone else, it is a question of you.\nAre you aware of the implications of love? Are you ready to love? Are you ready to drop your jealousies? Are you ready to share without asking anything in return?\nLove is the purest form of friendship, and it is available to very rare people. Others are only scratching each other. They call it love; just scratching each other’s skin. They are idiots, and the priests condemn them. They say, “Don’t scratch each other’s skin; otherwise you will be going into hell. There, the devil will scratch!” Strange: if two persons feel good scratching each other, it should not be anybody else’s concern. Soon they will get fed up by themselves.\nAnd who is this arrowsmith woman in the marketplace? You can go, by all means – but remember you have not yet learned the art of love, because it is another name of meditation.\nPaddy is training Dennis, his donkey, for the Irish Donkey Derby.\nThere is no doubt that Dennis is the fastest donkey in the whole of Ireland. But every time he races, Dennis slows down to wink at all the lady donkeys.\nGovindo – listen attentively!\nPaddy decides that there is only one solution to this problem and he takes Dennis to the vet to be doctored.\nA couple of weeks later, Dennis is waiting at the starting gate for the big race. He gazes straight ahead, ignoring all the other donkeys. His head is bent low, his eyes intense. Dennis has only the track on his mind.\nThe gun goes off and Dennis leaps away from the starting gate, but after a few paces, he stops, turns around and trots dejectedly back.\n“For crying out loud!” screams Paddy, “what is wrong?”\n“What is wrong?” snorts Dennis, “How do you think I felt when I jumped out from the start and some wise guy announced over the loudspeaker: ‘They’re off’!”\nGovindo, avoid the marketplace a little longer.\nThe dinner is finished and the head waiter is hovering amongst the twenty business delegates with the bill, which amounts to a thousand dollars.\nUnfortunately, the bill is pushed from one diner to another diner. No one seems to be taking responsibility for paying it.\nSuddenly, Hamish Mactavish, the only Scotsman present, announces in a loud voice: “Pass me that bill; I will pay!” The next morning, the papers carry the headline: “Scotsman shoots Jewish ventriloquist!”\nIt is a dangerous world out there. I think, wait a little longer.\nHymie Goldberg and Moishe Finkelstein are changing their clothes in the locker room after a game of golf.\nMoishe starts putting on a pair of women’s knickers; Hymie is astonished. “When did you start wearing women’s underwear?” he asks.\n“Well,” says Moishe shaking his head, “ever since Ruthie, my wife, found a pair on the front seat of my car.”\nMiss Goodbody is giving her class an English lesson, and all goes well until she explains the use of the word ‘perhaps’ to them.\n“Now, Billy,” she says, “will you make up a sentence to show that you understand how to use ‘perhaps’?”\nBilly stands up, thinks for a moment and says, “If we are very good, perhaps teacher will let us go early.”\n“Excellent,” says Miss Goodbody. Then she turns to little Ernie and says, “What about you, Ernest? Can you give us an example?”\nLittle Ernie stands up and says, “Does it have to be made up, Miss?”\n“No,” replies Miss Goodbody, “it can be true, as long as you use the word ‘perhaps’.”\n“Okay,” says Ernie, “when I saw you and the music teacher taking your pants off in the music room, I thought that perhaps you were going to shit on the piano.”\nAnd the last, before we do our daily meditation.\nBack at the zoo, Luigi’s demand that Griselda the Gorilla’s children be brought up Catholic is turned down by Herman Kanubowitz, the zoo’s Jewish director.\nAs a last resort, Griselda’s keeper puts a sign up on the gate of the zoo, which reads: “One thousand dollars to mate with ape!”\nKowalski has just returned some penguins to the zoo, when he sees the sign and walks into the keeper’s office.\nThe keeper takes one look at Kowalski and knows that he has found his man.

NIGHT OF THE SOUL? IS IT SOMETHING BELONGING TO THE PHYSICAL MONKEY
BRAIN? OR IS IT SOMETHING OF THE UNIVERSAL MIND, WHICH I AM ASSUMING IS
MY OWN HIGHER MIND?</p><p><br></p><p>ALSO, IF IT IS NOT OF THE PHYSICAL BRAIN, THEN IS THIS WHY IT IS A
WASTE OF TIME TO ATTEMPT TO END YOUR SUFFERING BY PUTTING A BULLET
THROUGH YOUR BRAIN?</p><p><br></p><p>Prem Sakino, the question that you have asked implies almost the
whole psychology of man. In one way, man is divided into the body, the
physiology, and the mind, the psychology. The brain is part of the body;
mind is the psychology – another name of psychology. They both belong to
something else – a deeper and higher consciousness, a universal
consciousness. But the state of the mind is very complex; it is almost
like a bridge between the soul, the universal, and the body, the
individual.</p><p><br></p><p>When the body dies the mind continues, as a wavelength of memories,
with the conscious soul. It will enter into new bodies; it will gather
more experiences, sufferings, joys. And through many lives, mind goes on
collecting. Each body allows it to have sufferings or blessings – but
slowly slowly, if it goes again and again into pain, misery, agony, it
becomes habitual for the mind that whichever body it may have, it will
fall into painful experiences.</p><p><br></p><p>The mind also dies one day.</p><p>Body dies many times; mind dies only once.</p><p><br></p><p>The day mind dies, you enter into the world of immortality, the
universal. That’s what we call enlightenment.</p><p><br></p><p>Until the mind dies, it remains the master; it does not accept being
a slave. The moment your innermost being asserts, that very assertion
becomes the death of the mind. Hence, meditation is defined as
no-mind.</p><p><br></p><p>It does not mean that the mind is not there; it simply means the
mastery of the mind is no longer there. It can still be used as a
vehicle, just like a flute, but the song is not of the flute. And the
flute cannot sing on its own – the flute is only a passage; it gives
way.</p><p><br></p><p>A man of no-mind also uses the mind when he speaks, but just like the
song of the flute.</p><p><br></p><p>One of the most cherished books of Hindus, SHRIMAD BHAGAVADGITA, is
very strange in the sense that it is called “the song of the divine.”
Just its title is so significant; from the very title it means that the
words are used not by the mind but by someone who has no mind.</p><p><br></p><p>In the East we never developed any psychology. This is one of the
most important differences that has grown between East and West. In the
East we have developed techniques and methods to go beyond mind; in the
West the philosopher, the thinker, has become too much involved in the
mechanics of the mind: what is mind?</p><p><br></p><p>It is so surprising that for ten thousand years in the East, which
has been continuously concerned with the inner search, nobody has
bothered about what mind is. If you can drop it, drop it, because all
that is real and authentic and true is beyond it. Why waste time with
something which is ephemeral?</p><p><br></p><p>But the whole of Western psychology is concerned with the ephemeral.
The psychologist is concerned with dreams. It is not just symbolic – he
is actually concerned with a bigger dream called the mind. And by trying
to look into dreams, the psychologist is trying to figure out the
functioning of the mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Why does he have to go to the dreams? Why can he not rely upon your
waking hours?</p><p><br></p><p>Your waking hours are fake. You say things which you don’t mean.
Perhaps you don’t intend to deceive anyone, but your very upbringing is
such that you are bound to deceive. Your every gesture is political, is
diplomatic. You are trying to influence the other person, you are trying
to convert the other person. You are trying, in short, to exploit the
other person’s gullibility. You are not saying what is true, you are
saying what people want to hear.</p><p><br></p><p>In each church, in each temple, in each synagogue, all the sermons
are simply what people want to hear. They are opium for the people, they
are consolations for people. People are in misery, people are in
suffering, but this suffering humanity becomes a great marketplace for
those who can exploit – in the name of compassion, in the name of
God.</p><p><br></p><p>They don’t remove your suffering – they can’t remove it, it is beyond
their power. But they can console you. They can make you feel at ease
with your agony; they can give you a dose of opium so</p><p>that you can go on living with all the suffering, all the pain,
without even bothering about it, without even thinking about it.</p><p><br></p><p>Hence, when you say something, it is not reliable. It may be true, it
may not be true. The psychologist has to go into your dreams because
your dreams have not been polluted by the priests, by the politicians,
by the educationists.</p><p><br></p><p>They are trying.</p><p><br></p><p>They are developing in the Soviet Union and in America both,
techniques for teaching people while they are asleep. Once those
techniques are refined, man will lose all freedom. Anyway, he is not
free – freedom is only a beautiful word, corresponding to no reality.
But a small freedom is there: you can dream your dream without any fear
of the neighbors, without any fear of the government, without any fear
of anybody – the parents, the teachers, the vested interests.</p><p><br></p><p>Dreaming is the only freedom. It is such a sad statement that I am
making, that you have only dreams where you are free. Otherwise, you are
not free; your freedom is just a show. Everybody is in chains, but the
chains are invisible.</p><p><br></p><p>The psychologist has to enter into your dreams so that he can find
out who you are. On the surface you are a celibate, a Catholic monk. But
do you think in the dreams also you are a Catholic and a celibate and a
monk? Most probably you are just the opposite of what you are pretending
to be when you are awake. Your whole wakefulness has been so polluted,
so dominated, so conditioned by others that you don’t even know that
what you are saying is not your own voice. It may be Voice of America or
it may be voice of anybody else, but it is not your voice.</p><p><br></p><p>Sometimes, watch whatever you say or do: is it authentically yours?
Or has somebody put it in your mind just like things are fed to a
computer? – your mother, your father... they were all well-wishers but
ignorant, utterly ignorant as far as self-knowledge is concerned. They
have made you Christians and Hindus and Mohammedans and communists. And
they have created a world which is, as far as consciousness is
concerned, absolutely contaminated, divided, a thousand and one
discriminations.</p><p><br></p><p>But it is only a thin layer. Underneath this thin layer is a vast
unconscious. This unconscious is all that has been repressed and not
allowed expression.</p><p><br></p><p>Everybody can remember hearing the parents say, “Don’t say that,
never say that! It is against civilization, culture; it is against
respectability, honor. Never mention it.” And slowly slowly, when again
and again it is said, you start pressing it deeper into your being. That
which has been repressed in you is your unconscious.</p><p><br></p><p>A man like Gautam Buddha has no unconscious. A man who is fully
awakened is simply pure consciousness. He does not dream, there is no
need for him to dream. He is living his life with all its dangers,
risks, the way he wants to live. He is not in any way following anybody
against himself.</p><p><br></p><p>He is not a hypocrite, a pretender, an actor, repeating like a parrot
either what he has been told by religions or by politicians or by other
vested interests: “You have to be like this and you have to be like
that.” Everything... how to sit, how to stand up, how to walk. So many
chains and so many</p><p>locks on your mouth that you cannot say a single word that arises
within you, not a single flower that blossoms in your consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>This repressed part of your being creates the unconscious.</p><p><br></p><p>You are asking, “What exactly is this unconscious mind which is also
called the dark night of the soul?” It is your repressed mind, centuries
old, of many lives. Each time you change the body, your unconscious mind
becomes bigger because more repressions are added to it.</p><p><br></p><p>You will be surprised that you are not at all aware of what is
contained within you, in your own house.</p><p><br></p><p>A Zen master, one dark night, was sleeping in his small hut. He had
only one woolen blanket, but he was awake and he saw a thief entering
in. He felt very sorry for the thief because he knew perfectly well that
in his house there was nothing; for thirty years he had been searching.
But who knows? This man may be able to find something.</p><p><br></p><p>So he got up slowly, lit a small candle, and went behind the thief.
The thief looked at him, utterly frozen – “My god, that man I was
thinking was either dead or asleep is coming – naked because he has only
one blanket – with a candle!” Just think of yourself.…</p><p><br></p><p>But the Zen monk said to the thief, “Don’t be worried and don’t feel
in any way offended. I am a poor man, I have only one blanket. So don’t
be worried. And in this night, dark night and far away from the village,
nobody will know what we are doing here.”</p><p><br></p><p>The thief said, “What are we doing?”</p><p><br></p><p>The master said, “The same thing that you are doing!”</p><p><br></p><p>The thief said, “You are a strange man. I am a thief; I am looking
for something.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “That’s what I say! For thirty years I am also looking for
something, but in this house there is nothing. So let us make a
contract: if we find something, we will divide it.”</p><p><br></p><p>The thief said, “My god! You are the owner of this house...”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I am not the owner of this house. Somebody was, but he is
dead. I found this hut and seeing that nobody is living here, I started
living here thirty years ago. Since then I have been searching –
something must be somewhere; that old man cannot have taken away all the
things with him. In fact, in death nobody can take away anything.”</p><p><br></p><p>The thief said, “The morning is coming close and I have not come here
to discuss great matters, death, and whether somebody can take anything
beyond death or not. You just please let me go.”</p><p><br></p><p>The master said, “But what about the search? Have I to search my
whole life alone? Won’t you give me a hand?”</p><p><br></p><p>The thief said, “I pray... just let me get out! If people find me
here in the morning, there is bound to be trouble.”</p><p>That Zen monk said, “There will be no trouble at all, because for
thirty years I have been waiting. Nobody comes here. Let us just have a
good dialogue, and in the morning we can search better, more light, and
maybe we can find something. And we can become partners! If you find
something in somebody else’s house, half will be mine and half will be
yours.” He said, “You are a religious man – are you joking? Are you
absolutely mad? Making a contract with a thief... people think you are a
saint!”</p><p><br></p><p>The monk said, “That is true. People think I am a saint, but I don’t
have anything other than the blanket. If you don’t want to divide the
blanket in two parts, you can take it home.”</p><p><br></p><p>And he gave the blanket to the thief. The thief just could not
believe what was happening and he ran out. As he was going out, the monk
shouted, “Come back and close the door! And always remember: when
somebody gives you something, at least say thank you. Learn
manners!”</p><p><br></p><p>The thief said, “Thank you,” and closed the door. And the monk said,
“Remember – this ‘thank you’ will help you go a long way.”</p><p><br></p><p>After two years, the thief was arrested for stealing in some other
house, caught red-handed. In the court, the magistrate asked him, “Can
you give some reference, anybody who knows you?”</p><p><br></p><p>He remembered that poor man, so beautiful and so lovely and so nice.
He said, “Yes, I know one Zen monk who lives outside the town.”</p><p><br></p><p>The magistrate said, “That will do. If that monk – I know him – if he
can say anything in favor of you, you will be released.”</p><p><br></p><p>The monk was called and he was asked about the thief. The monk said,
“This man is a very beautiful, simple man. One night, by mistake he
entered into my house.”</p><p><br></p><p>The magistrate said, “What do you mean, ‘by mistake’?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I said ‘by mistake’ because the doors were open and everybody knows
that there is nothing in that hut but me and my blanket. And I offered
my blanket to him. He was a guest. He tried not to take it, I had almost
to force him. And he is so mannerly that he said to me, ‘Thank you, sir’
and he closed the door. This man is a very nice man, you should not
harass him.”</p><p><br></p><p>Because that monk said, “You should not harass him,” the thief was
released. He could not believe it! Neither did he understand that night,
nor could he understand the saint’s statements in court in his favor. He
followed the saint.</p><p><br></p><p>The monk said, “Are you coming now?” He said, “Yes, I am coming
now.”</p><p>He said, “You unnecessarily wasted two years. I was telling you to
get into a partnership from the very beginning. You had nothing to lose;
I lost my blanket. Now what do you want?”</p><p>He said, “Now I want to be in your service, to sit by your side and
listen to what you are saying. Now I can see that you are not an
ordinary man; that you don’t belong to the masses and the crowd, that
you are utterly different.”</p><p><br></p><p>The Zen monk said, “If you can see the difference, then you are
accepted. Be my fellow traveler. I was so sad that night when you could
not find anything in the house. You had given me so much respect by
entering my hut, because who enters poor people’s huts? People go to
steal in palaces. You raised my status to a king, I was grateful. But I
had nothing else to give to you but an old blanket, and when you left I
wept because, ‘If that man had told me a few days before, I could have
collected some things.’</p><p><br></p><p>“And sitting on my window sill, I saw the moon in the sky and I wrote
a poem. I have not told anybody, but with you I will share it. It is a
beautiful poem. It says: My heart weeps, cries, because I could not
offer a guest anything worthwhile. If it were in my power, I would have
given him the whole moon. But the moon is not in my power.”</p><p><br></p><p>It is a beautiful piece. Such a man has no unconscious at all. It is
pure consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>You are asking, “Is it something belonging to the physical monkey
brain?” Ordinarily yes. Ordinarily your mind belongs to your body
because it is nothing but the functioning of your brain, which is part
of the body. But the whole effort of meditation is to take it away from
the body, to take it away from the brain, purify it from all that gives
it limitations – of Hinduism, Mohammedanism, of man, of woman, of all
kinds of inferiorities, superiorities. To take it away from all that
towards nothingness, towards a silence, towards a peace that passeth
understanding... then it is not part of the brain; then it becomes part
of the universal consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what you are saying: “Or is it something of the universal
mind?” Ordinarily, no. Extraordinarily, yes.</p><p><br></p><p>You are saying, “... which I am assuming is my own higher mind.” Yes,
it is your own higher mind, but there is no you. It is simply pure
awareness with no ‘I’ and with no ‘you’ – just a mirror, reflecting.</p><p><br></p><p>And finally, you are asking, “If it is not of the physical brain,
then is this why it is a waste of time to attempt to end your suffering
by putting a bullet through your brain?”</p><p><br></p><p>Prem Sakino, it is not only a waste of time putting a bullet through
your brain, it is again creating more unconsciousness. By suicide,
nobody can become enlightened. By suicide, one is born again more deeply
rooted in agony. The agony of suicide follows into the next life, the
following life.</p><p><br></p><p>So it is certainly a waste of a bullet, and immensely harmful to your
future life.</p><p><br></p><p>If it were so simple to become enlightened by putting a bullet in the
brain, there would have been millions of enlightened people. But
enlightenment has to be earned. It has to be deserved.</p><p><br></p><p>It is a strange phenomenon because in a sense, it is already yours,
and in a sense you have to find it. It is hidden inside your being.</p><p><br></p><p>No bullet can reach there, but you can reach.</p><p>You can reach just by being silent and more silent. As the silence
deepens, you are coming closer and closer to a light which is your
ultimate source of life.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, you will be burned; as an individual entity you will be no more.
But as a universal being, as a whole cosmos, you will be.</p><p><br></p><p>And that is the only blissful state. Other than that, you never know
what bliss is. It is not pleasure; pleasure is not even something like a
faraway cousin. You cannot understand bliss by measuring it in terms of
pleasure. Pleasure is almost like scratching: it feels good, but after a
while it hurts. Because you have scratched too much, blood starts
coming. What you call pleasure is nothing but scratching.</p><p><br></p><p>Blissfulness has nothing to do with you; blissfulness is your very
nature. You simply relax into yourself, to the deepest rock bottom of
your being...</p><p><br></p><p>And you are light and you are truth, and you are beauty and you are
love, and you are all that one can desire. The glory, the splendor of
the whole existence is yours.</p><p><br></p><p>But you are not there. Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>SINCE I FIRST MET YOU ALMOST TEN YEARS AGO, I COULD NOT DO ANYTHING
BUT FOLLOW YOUR STEPS AND BE WITH YOU.</p><p><br></p><p>IT FELT LIKE WITHDRAWING FROM THE WORLD TO LEARN TO KNOW MYSELF. AS I
BECAME MORE AWARE OF MYSELF I BECAME MORE SENSITIVE, BUT DETACHED AND
COOL.</p><p><br></p><p>BELOVED MASTER, AM I BEFOOLING MYSELF, AS I FEEL IT IS NOW TIME FOR
ME TO GO AND LEARN WITH THE ARROWSMITH WOMAN IN THE MARKETPLACE...?</p><p><br></p><p>Govindo, you need not befool with any arrowsmith woman. A real woman
is sitting in front of me! I offer to introduce you to this woman. You
will not find such a woman anywhere in the world; with a small beard, a
beautiful mustache... And really looking beautiful!</p><p><br></p><p>I wonder, why has Vimal not been using this dress from the very
beginning? After I have left, you all have to see her – I really mean
her, it is not a mistake – and rejoice in a real woman.</p><p><br></p><p>Where are you going? – on a rented bicycle, to some arrowsmith woman!
Can’t you find any woman here? If you cannot find someone to love here,
you will not find any-where. Because it is not a question of someone
else, it is a question of you.</p><p><br></p><p>Are you aware of the implications of love? Are you ready to love? Are
you ready to drop your jealousies? Are you ready to share without asking
anything in return?</p><p>Love is the purest form of friendship, and it is available to very
rare people. Others are only scratching each other. They call it love;
just scratching each other’s skin. They are idiots, and the priests
condemn them. They say, “Don’t scratch each other’s skin; otherwise you
will be going into hell. There, the devil will scratch!” Strange: if two
persons feel good scratching each other, it should not be anybody else’s
concern. Soon they will get fed up by themselves.</p><p><br></p><p>And who is this arrowsmith woman in the marketplace? You can go, by
all means – but remember you have not yet learned the art of love,
because it is another name of meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>Paddy is training Dennis, his donkey, for the Irish Donkey Derby.</p><p><br></p><p>There is no doubt that Dennis is the fastest donkey in the whole of

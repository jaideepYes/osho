IF MEDITATION IS CONCERNED WITH THE EXPERIENCER, NOT THE EXPERIENCE, HOW DO THE NEW HI-TECH EXPERIENCE KITS MOVE US INTO MEDITATION?\nPradeepa, the question you have asked is very relevant, particularly because so many machines are being developed around the world, pretending that they can give you meditation. You just have to plug your ears with earphones and relax and within ten minutes you will reach the state of meditation.\nThis is utter stupidity. But there is a reason why such an idea has come to the minds of technical people. The whole responsibility goes to Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. What he calls “transcendental meditation” is just repeating a certain mantra, or just any word, continuously not giving a chance to the mind to have thoughts, emotions, sentiments... and certainly, if you can manage even for ten minutes to keep the mind in abeyance, you will feel a very beautiful peace, silence. It may be even healthful, a well-being can be felt for hours, but it is not meditation.\nThese machines which hi-technology is creating... I have ordered the best ones to be sent here, so that you can also experience what I am saying.\nMind functions on one wavelength when it is awake; when it is dreaming it functions on a different wavelength. When it is fast asleep it functions on another wavelength. But none of these are meditation.\nFor thousands of years we have called meditation TURIYA, “the fourth.” When you go beyond the deepest sleep and still you are aware, that awareness is meditation. It is not an experience, it is you, your very being.\nBut these hi-tech mechanisms can be of tremendous use in the right hands. They can create wavelengths in your mind so that you start feeling relaxed, as if half asleep thoughts are disappearing and a moment comes that everything becomes silent in you. That is the moment when the waves are of deep sleep. You will not be aware of this deep sleep, but after ten minutes when you are unplugged from the machine you will see the effects: that you are calm, quiet, peaceful. No worry, no tension life seems to be more playful and joyous. One feels as if one has had an inner bath. Your whole being is calm and cool.\nWhat the transcendental meditation of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi can give, these machines can give in a far better way, in a more certain way, without fail. To anybody, it doesn’t matter, because your effort is not needed.\nIn transcendental meditation you are trying to create those waves without knowing it. You are only aware of repeating a certain mantra, but repetition of anything continuously creates boredom. Boredom is very restful... and that’s why in churches you will find most of the people having a beautiful Sunday morning sleep when the sermon is going on.\nIt is strange that it happens in every church, in every place all around the world, that the people who go to listen to the sermon sleep. Because those sermons are the same the same BIBLE, the same statements, the same interpretation. In fact the preachers have a few ready-made sermons: five, six, seven. So they go on changing one week this sermon, another week another sermon. Those who have been coming to listen to them for years know every sermon; the moment the preacher starts, they know what is going to happen and they relax and close their eyes.\nBut with machines, things are very certain, because they don’t depend on any doing of yours. It is just like listening to music: you feel peaceful, harmonious. Those machines will lead you up to the third state: deep sleep, sleep without dreams.\nAnd I have ordered them: they will be coming here soon and with one machine even a hundred persons can be plugged in. A hundred persons for ten minutes, then another hundred, then another hundred... the whole day the machine goes on creating meditative waves.\nBut if you think this is meditation then you are wrong. I will say this is good experience, and while you are in that moment of deep sleep... If you can be aware also from the very beginning, as the mind starts changing its waves you have to be more alert, more awake, more watchful of what is happening and you will see that mind is by and by falling asleep. If you can see the mind falling asleep, the one who is seeing the mind falling asleep is your being. And that is the authentic purpose of all meditation.\nSo these machines cannot create that awareness that awareness you will have to create. But these machines can certainly create within ten minutes a possibility which you may not be able to create in years of effort. So I am not against these hi-tech instruments, I am all for them. It is just that I want the people who are spreading those machines around the world to know that they are doing good work, but it is incomplete.\nIt will be complete only when the person in the deepest silence is also alert, like a small flame of awareness which goes on burning. Everything disappears, all around darkness and silence and peace, but an unwavering flame of awareness remains.\nIf the machine can be used in the right hands and people can be taught that the real thing will come not through the machine, the machine can create the very essential ground in which that flame can grow. But that flame depends on you, not on the machine.\nSo I am in favor of those machines on the one hand and on the other hand I am very much against them, because many, many people will think, “This is meditation.”\nAnd people are getting deceived. What Maharishi Mahesh Yogi could not do, these machines will do immense harm. He has done harm to many people, but these machines will spread all over the world very soon. And they are simple, there is nothing much in it. It is only a question of creating certain waves.\nOur musicians can learn from those machines, what waves they create, and they can start creating those waves through their instruments. There is no need for the machines, just the musicians can create those waves for all of you and all of you will start falling asleep! But if you can remain awake even in the deepest sleep, when you see that just one step more and you will become unconscious, you have learned a secret. That machine can be used beautifully.\nAnd this is true about all machines of the world. In the right hands they can be used tremendously for the benefit of mankind. In the wrong hands they can become hindrances. And unfortunately, there are so many wrong hands.…\nAlready they are spreading in America, in Europe, and better and better mechanisms are being developed.\nOne of my sannyasins you may remember Proper Sagar. His letter has come to me today... because he was refused entry at Bombay airport. He could not enter India. He tried from Kathmandu there he was refused. Because they have his name on a list at every airport around India, he could not enter. So finally he went to Hawaii and met a woman who works with crystals and he started working with her. The woman is old and he proved a good, healthy young man to help her.\nNow Proper Sagar has created a carpet. All around the carpet there are crystals, and the carpet has electric wires running inside. And with those electric wires he creates the same kind of wavelength. So you don’t even have to plug your ears, you just lie down on the carpet and the carpet does the meditation! You feel great, and Proper Sagar goes on changing the wavelength.\nHe has sent me pictures of his carpet. This is great, but on one carpet how many people will you be able to manage? It can be done around the whole Buddha Hall! It is simple technology to change the wavelength, and as the wavelength changes you will start feeling drowsy, sleepy.\nBut this is not meditation, this is a dangerous deception. If it is not in the right hands then the person will go home thinking he has meditated, and he has only been lying on Proper Sagar’s carpet! Neither Proper Sagar knows what meditation is nor the carpet knows what meditation is, but that\nfellow has got the idea that he has meditated. And people are giving money, a hundred dollars for ten minutes. Not costly... if real meditation is available for a hundred dollars for ten minutes, I don’t think it is costly.\nBut it is not meditation, it is simply a change of the radio waves that are continuously moving around you in the air.\nI think within a week the machine will be here. You can all first experience what the machine can give you, and then I will tell you what you can get out of the machine which the machine cannot give you, but it can be certainly helpful as an experience. Otherwise for many people meditation remains only a word. They think that some time they will meditate, and there remains a doubt whether anybody meditates or not.\nProper Sagar has informed me that “I am now trying, Osho, so that even Dynamic Meditation can be done on the carpet.” And I think it is possible, because the question is... you will be jumping on the carpet and the carpet will be changing the electric waves in your body. And he does not know “Yaa-Hoo” yet. Otherwise, with “Yaa- Hoo” and the magic carpet that he has, within ten minutes... you enter inside, and after ten minutes a Gautam Buddha goes out!\nJust a little dance, “Yaa-Hoo” and see you in the other world! There is no need to do it again and again.\nBut in the West the mind is mechanical, the approach is mechanical; they want to reduce everything to a machine, and they are capable of reducing it.\nBut there are things which are beyond the capacity of any machine. Awareness cannot be created by any machine, it is beyond the scope of any hi-tech. But what hi-tech can give you can certainly be used, so when I was informed I immediately ordered that the best, the latest machine should be sent here so I can show my people both things. I can show them what the machine can do and tell them that this is not meditation, and also can tell them that this can be used as a very beautiful jumping ground into meditation.\nAnd once you have tasted awareness perhaps a few times the machine may be helpful, so it becomes more and more clear and your awareness becomes more and more separate from the silence that the machine is creating. Then you should start doing it without the machine. And once you have learned to do it without the machine, the machine has helped you immensely.\nBut people should not believe in machines too much.\nI have heard about a man who was uneducated, could not read. He went to the optician and said, “Just look and check my eyes, because I cannot read.”\nSo the optician said, “There is no problem, I will check and I will give you glasses and you will be able to read.”\nThe man said, “Are you certain?”\nThe optician said, “There is no problem, I am doing it every day.”\nBut the man said, “One thing you should know I am uneducated!”\nThe optician said, “Then it is very difficult. Glasses I can give you, but education? If you don’t even recognize the alphabet then glasses will not help. Perhaps your eyes are all right and they don’t need glasses, but you need a certain education.”\nBut glasses can be helpful if you are able to read and your eyes are not functioning properly. Then glasses can enhance the power, help your eyes. And this is the situation with every machine.\nPradeepa, in just a few days... because in India everything takes such a long time. The machines may have already reached Bombay airport, but to take them out of customs is just anybody’s guess: one week, two weeks, three weeks... Here things go so slow.\nOne of my friends... he was very old, but we had a certain deep affinity. A case was started against him in 1915, because he had written a book of history which was different from the books which the British government had approved. Although he was right, the government did not want those facts to be taught to the people because they were against the British government.\nSo the case was against him, the publisher, the printer, the owner of the press against four parties. And the case was so complicated, because what he had written was absolutely factual, right; you could not just deny it. It was self-evident. So it went on from one court to another court, to the high court, to the supreme court. Out of four, three of the parties died; only the writer remained.\nHis name was Pandit Sunderlal. He was really a very authentic, sincere man. All the judges who tried his case died. All the advocates, for or against, were gone. Because the case went on and on, even the government which had started it was finished, in 1947. But the case continued.\nI inquired of him in 1975 he had become very old “When is your case going to end?” He said, “It cannot end unless I die. Then they will close it, but otherwise it will continue because they cannot accept defeat and they cannot allow me to be victorious. All the facts are in my favor, and the strangest thing is that the government that started the case those facts were against that government that government is gone, the country is independent. But bureaucracy works in a strange way. Those files have to be completed, so they are not doing anything. They simply go on postponing, and they are simply waiting for me to die.”\nHe died and the case was closed. But for sixty years... a case that can be decided in six hours, not more than that! But in this country...\nI came to know, in a family I was staying with, that they received a letter written to their grandfather who has been dead for almost fifty years. And the letter was sent not from a very faraway planet, but just from a village eighty miles away. It traveled so slowly... even I wondered how it managed to travel so slowly. Eighty miles in fifty years?\nBut it happens in many places. Every year some case happens: some letter has traveled for thirty- six years; a few letters never reach they start the journey, but... Perhaps some time they will reach, but you will not be here and neither will the person to whom you have addressed the letter.\nFiles don’t move. Just go into any office and you will see on every table, file upon file. It seems nobody is doing anything but just every day protecting the files. And people go on bribing them: “My file pull it out and put it first.” But they don’t know: somebody else comes and he bribes; his file comes on top of yours. So there is nothing that you can do, and those people go on collecting bribes.\nIn this country, bribery is not a crime, it is simply friendliness. For centuries, India has been bribing even God. People go to the temple and say, “If a child is born to my wife and if he is a boy, remember I will bring one coconut and sweets as a present to you.” If this is not bribery, then what is?\nSo the country has been traditionally accustomed to it. Nobody seems to think that anything is wrong in it: I am doing your work, bringing your file, which is hundreds of files down, to the top. Naturally some prasad, some baksheesh, some friendly gesture... But then somebody else comes, and his file... And nobody wants his table to be clean of files, because those files are so productive. If you don’t have any file on your table, you are a beggar; you don’t have anything.\nI have heard about a friend who became a clerk in a collectorate, and he was a very efficient person. He managed to dispose of all the files in one day. The collector himself told him, “You idiot! Now what are your sources of earning? Are you thinking that you are going to live only on your wages? Those files have been on this table... one knows not how long. Many collectors have come and gone, the files have remained there. They were sources of income.”\nBut now these machines will be available as sources of income. Just as you go into a barber’s salon, you go into a meditator’s shop, give a hundred dollars in America; in India a hundred rupees will do meditate for ten minutes and go home. And think about yourself that you are a great religious person.\nNow there is a danger from these mechanisms. Soon you will see that churches and temples and mosques will install these machines, because otherwise they will lose their customers.\nI have told you about a church... An old man used to come with his grandchild and he used to sleep. That was not a problem; the problem was that soon he would start snoring. Many times the preacher said to him, privately, that “You are a great member of our congregation, but your snoring disturbs many other sleepers. I have no objection, but many people come to me and say, ‘That old man snores too much. We cannot sleep at all. And he is such a regular person that he comes first into the church every Sunday.’” Finally, the priest found a way. He talked to the child. He said, “I will give you one rupee if you can keep your old man awake.”\nThe child said, “How will I keep him awake?”\nThe priest said, “It is easy. Whenever he starts snoring, you start hitting him. He will be angry with you, but you are getting one rupee.”\nHe said, “Done let us see what happens.”\nThe boy did not allow his grandfather to snore at all that day. The old man was very angry. Many times he looked at him and he said, “You never used to be such... what are you doing? You just listen to the sermon.” On the way home, he said, “What is the matter? Why are you harassing me?”\nThe boy said, “It is a business. The priest is giving me one rupee to keep you awake.”\nThe old man said, “You idiot! I will give you two rupees, just let me sleep silently. And remember, that priest will make signs towards you: ‘Wake the old man!’ Don’t bother, just go on looking at him directly without any fear.”\nThe boy said, “I want an advance, because you always talk great things and nothing happens.” The old man said, “This is too much. An advance?”\nHe said, “Otherwise, I am going to follow the priest. He has already given me one rupee.”\nSo the old man gave him two rupees on the second Sunday, and slept heartily and snored as loudly as possible without any fear.\nThe priest was very much worried. He looked at the child, and the child was sitting straight, as if he had completely forgotten. Many times the priest made indications, but the child did not pay any attention. So after the meeting he took the child aside and said, “You are such a cheat! I have told you and I have given you one rupee; I was going to give you one rupee today.”\nThe boy said, “Now one rupee will not do. My old man has given me an advance of two rupees. Have you guts enough to give me three rupees in advance?”\nThe priest said, “I am a poor priest, and in this competition... you are a very nasty fellow!” He said, “Business is business. Otherwise I am going to follow the advice of my grandfather.”\nIn churches, in synagogues, all is simply talk and talk, which people have heard thousands of times, meaningless. But it is just that they have to go there to show themselves, that they belong to the society. It is a formality. Otherwise, people would start thinking that they were becoming rebellious, or something was wrong. So it is a social function.\nAs psychoanalysis became important in Western countries, and the people who used to come for advice and confession to the priest... they were the customers, because the priest would give them a punishment: ten dollars, twenty dollars, whatever the coin. These same people started going to the psychoanalyst, who was more educated, more sophisticated, although you had to pay more too. But people’s minds are strange. If you have to pay more, you think you are getting a really great thing. If you have to pay nothing, you think that it does not have any significance.\nThe psychoanalyst now earns the most in comparison to any other profession in the whole world. And the clients are the same those who used to confess in the Catholic Church are now confessing on the psychoanalyst’s couch. The priests became concerned “This is competition, and a dangerous thing; it is growing. More and more psychoanalysts, more and more therapies, and people are disappearing from the churches.”\nNow it is part of every Christian missionary’s education to study psychoanalysis. I was invited to one of their theological colleges, which is the biggest in the East. I was surprised to see a department\nof psychoanalysis. I said, “What are you doing with psychoanalysis? Jesus has not talked about it. In fact, he himself needed psychoanalysis! But the Jews had no idea what to do...”\nIf Sigmund Freud had been born before Jesus and he was a Jew also Jesus would not have been crucified. He would be lying on the couch of Sigmund Freud, confessing that “This idea tortures me that I am the only begotten son of God. However I try, it does not leave me. I dream about it. Even in the waking hours, I feel I am the only begotten son of God.” There would have been no Christianity. But fortunately, Sigmund Freud was born two thousand years afterwards.\nBut both are Jews, both are Jewish concerns, and both are earning more than any other firm in the world and they are competitors!\nThese machines will soon be found in every church, because otherwise they will become competitors. They will give you a certain kind of solace. That’s why I became interested that before the disease spreads, we should make it clear to the world that these machines don’t give you meditation.\nMeditation is not something which a machine can give. But certainly these machines can be very useful and can be used to prepare the ground for meditation to grow. So in a way I am very favorable and in another way I am absolutely against. What these machines can do is dangerous in the sense that you can be deceived, you can start feeling that you are a great meditator. You have the machine... and there are small machines which individuals can have. There are bigger machines in which four persons can join together. And the bigger machine, in which four persons can meditate together, has the capacity to just go on adding more and more earphones to it and hundreds of people can meditate together. We will manage it here, because it has to be made clear to the world that this is not meditation but it is a very good preparation for meditation.\nAnd once you have had a few experiences, then there is no need of\nthe machine. Then you know what happens: you can close your eyes and you can make it happen. Then it has a beauty of its own.\nSo Pradeepa, you need not be worried. Your vipassana group is not in danger! Now, before our meditations...\nPremdipa has written:\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nRECENTLY WHEN YOU HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT MEDITATION, I FEEL GUILT ARISING IN ME FOR NOT MEDITATING.\nAnd I have been telling you again and again not to feel guilty for anything! Forget all about meditation, but there is no need to feel guilt. Because guilt will destroy your life much more than anything else\ncan. It will destroy your joy, it will destroy your love, it will destroy your peace. And what is the reason that you don’t feel like meditating?\nYou say, “I FEEL SO FULL WITH MY EMOTIONS, TAKING IN THE SPICES OF LIFE AND ENJOYING JUST BEING HERE, THAT I DON’T EVEN WANT TO MEDITATE.”\nWho is telling you to meditate? At least you cannot blame me. All I am saying is: enjoy life and the spices and just be here, and there is no need of any meditation.\nMeditation is from the same root as ‘medicine’. If you are healthy enough, there is no need to feel guilty that you are not taking medicine. Sick people need medicine. You are perfectly healthy, enjoying life and its spices, enjoying just being here. That’s perfectly good. You need not ask FORGIVE ME FOR SAYING THIS, FOR I KNOW YOU HAVE SPOKEN SO MUCH ON THE\nBEAUTY AND RELAXATION OF MEDITATION. In fact, I should ask you: Forgive me that I have spoken so much on the beauty and relaxation of meditation that it has created guilt in you.\nNow you are creating guilt in me!\nAND I HAVE EXPERIENCED GLIMPSES OF PURE ECSTASY AND UNBOUNDED JOY THAT ARE TOTALLY INEXPRESSIBLE.\nGreat, Premdipa! Then what more meditation do you want? You already have it. But the trouble is... you say,\nBUT I AM ENJOYING THIS LOVE, THIS CRAZINESS HERE EVEN YOUR HEART SURGERY SO MUCH THAT I DON’T EVEN THINK ABOUT MEDITATING.\nThen who is writing this question?\nI LOVE YOU WITH MY WHOLE BEING.\nJust don’t do that. Because I am alone and you are too many and if everybody loves me with his whole being, you will kill me! Just a poor soul... your whole being! And ask anybody everybody loves me with his whole being, and I have to remain hiding in my room because if somebody comes and starts loving me with his whole being then it is the end of my life!\nJust a little love is enough.\nI am a very contented man, I don’t ask much. Just a little “Yaa-Hoo” that’s enough.\nAND I CANNOT THANK YOU ENOUGH FOR EVERYTHING.\nMy god! I don’t remember that I have done anything to you!\nBUT I HAVE NO LONGING TO PURSUE THESE GLIMPSES ANY FURTHER. CAN THIS BE, OR AM I TOTALLY ON THE WRONG TRACK?\nI hope that you are totally on the wrong track, because I don’t want to meet somebody who loves me with his whole being, who does not want to meditate, and who already has experiences of pure ecstasy and unbounded joy that are totally inexpressible. And who does not want to meditate who not only does not want to meditate, he does not even think about it!\nThen I am puzzled: either you are on the wrong track... or perhaps you are cuckoo.\nPope the Polack is on his world pilgrimage. He stops in San Francisco to bless the people and take part in a holy mass at the cathedral.\nClaude, a transvestite, happens to be sitting next to the aisle as the pope comes past on his way to the altar, swinging the incense burner.\n“Hey, sweetheart,” says Claude to a startled Pope the Polack, “I just love your gown. But did you know that your handbag is on fire?”\nYou must be the same type of person.\nEzra Grubelberg fell out of a fourth-story window. While he is lying flat on the ground with a big crowd around him, a policeman walks over and asks, “What happened?”\n“I don’t know,” Ezra replies, “I just got here.”\nGrandma Faginbaum walks into the pub with a parrot on her finger. She holds it up and shouts, “I will screw the first guy who can guess the weight of this parrot.”\nAfter a long silence, a drunk in the back of the bar yells out, “Two hundred kilos.” Grandma whirls round and says, “Close enough!”\nYou seem to belong to these people.\nOne night, Paddy and Sean are stumbling along some railway tracks when Sean turns to Paddy and says, “I hate this staircase. The steps are too far apart.”\n“I don’t mind that,” says Paddy, “the thing that is killing me is the low hand-rails.”\nBernie Bernstein phones Goldberg and Finkelstein, the merchants. “Put me through to Mr. Finkelstein, please,” says Bernie.\n“I am afraid Mr. Finkelstein has gone out, sir,” replies the secretary. “Then get me Mr. Goldberg,” says Bernie.\n“I am afraid Mr. Goldberg is tied up at present,” says the girl. “Okay,” says Bernie, “I will call back.” Ten minutes pass.\n“Mr. Goldberg, please,” says Bernie.\n“Mr. Goldberg is still tied up,” answers the girl. “I will phone back,” says Bernie. Half an hour later... “Get me Mr. Goldberg,” demands Bernie.\n“I am terribly sorry, sir,” says the girl, “but Mr. Goldberg is still tied up.” “I will phone back,” snaps Bernie. And another half hour passes.\n“Get me Goldberg!” shouts Bernie.\n“I have got dreadful news, sir,” says the girl, “Mr. Goldberg is still tied up.”\n“My god,” screams Bernie. “This is ridiculous! How can you run a business this way? One partner is out all day and the other is tied up for hours on end. What is going on there?”\n“Well, you see, sir,” explains the secretary, “whenever Mr. Finkelstein goes out, he ties up Mr. Goldberg.”\nIt is the mailman’s last day on the job, and he is feeling mixed emotions. On the one hand he is glad to be retiring, but on the other hand he will miss seeing the beautiful young married woman he has fancied for the last few years.\nHe is shocked and delighted when she opens her door for this last time, wearing a see-through gown, and invites him in. She drags him up to the bedroom and makes passionate love to him.\nAfterwards she cooks him a delicious breakfast. When he is about to leave, the young woman goes to her purse, takes out a dollar bill and gives it to him.\n“I don’t understand,” says the satisfied mailman. “You are going to pay me as well?”\n“It was my husband’s idea,” the woman explains, “when I told him you were retiring and suggested we give you something, he said ‘Screw him, give him a dollar’.”\n“The breakfast,” she adds proudly, “was my idea.” Okay, Maneesha?\nYes, Osho.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"5245","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/yaahoo_the_mystic_rose/part10/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/yaahoo_the_mystic_rose/>YAA-HOO!

IF MEDITATION IS
CONCERNED WITH THE EXPERIENCER, NOT THE EXPERIENCE, HOW DO THE NEW
HI-TECH EXPERIENCE KITS MOVE US INTO MEDITATION?</p><p>Pradeepa, the question you have asked is very relevant, particularly
because so many machines are being developed around the world,
pretending that they can give you meditation. You just have to plug your
ears with earphones and relax and within ten minutes you will reach the
state of meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>This is utter stupidity. But there is a reason why such an idea has
come to the minds of technical people. The whole responsibility goes to
Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. What he calls “transcendental meditation” is just
repeating a certain mantra, or just any word, continuously not giving a
chance to the mind to have thoughts, emotions, sentiments... and
certainly, if you can manage even for ten minutes to keep the mind in
abeyance, you will feel a very beautiful peace, silence. It may be even
healthful, a well-being can be felt for hours, but it is not
meditation.</p><p>These machines which hi-technology is creating... I have ordered the
best ones to be sent here, so that you can also experience what I am
saying.</p><p><br></p><p>Mind functions on one wavelength when it is awake; when it is
dreaming it functions on a different wavelength. When it is fast asleep
it functions on another wavelength. But none of these are
meditation.</p><p>For thousands of years we have called meditation TURIYA, “the
fourth.” When you go beyond the deepest sleep and still you are aware,
that awareness is meditation. It is not an experience, it is you, your
very being.</p><p><br></p><p>But these hi-tech mechanisms can be of tremendous use in the right
hands. They can create wavelengths in your mind so that you start
feeling relaxed, as if half asleep thoughts are disappearing and a
moment comes that everything becomes silent in you. That is the moment
when the waves are of deep sleep. You will not be aware of this deep
sleep, but after ten minutes when you are unplugged from the machine you
will see the effects: that you are calm, quiet, peaceful. No worry, no
tension life seems to be more playful and joyous. One feels as if one
has had an inner bath. Your whole being is calm and cool.</p><p><br></p><p>What the transcendental meditation of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi can give,
these machines can give in a far better way, in a more certain way,
without fail. To anybody, it doesn’t matter, because your effort is not
needed.</p><p><br></p><p>In transcendental meditation you are trying to create those waves
without knowing it. You are only aware of repeating a certain mantra,
but repetition of anything continuously creates boredom. Boredom is very
restful... and that’s why in churches you will find most of the people
having a beautiful Sunday morning sleep when the sermon is going on.</p><p><br></p><p>It is strange that it happens in every church, in every place all
around the world, that the people who go to listen to the sermon sleep.
Because those sermons are the same the same BIBLE, the same statements,
the same interpretation. In fact the preachers have a few ready-made
sermons: five, six, seven. So they go on changing one week this sermon,
another week another sermon. Those who have been coming to listen to
them for years know every sermon; the moment the preacher starts, they
know what is going to happen and they relax and close their eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>But with machines, things are very certain, because they don’t depend
on any doing of yours. It is just like listening to music: you feel
peaceful, harmonious. Those machines will lead you up to the third
state: deep sleep, sleep without dreams.</p><p><br></p><p>And I have ordered them: they will be coming here soon and with one
machine even a hundred persons can be plugged in. A hundred persons for
ten minutes, then another hundred, then another hundred... the whole day
the machine goes on creating meditative waves.</p><p><br></p><p>But if you think this is meditation then you are wrong. I will say
this is good experience, and while you are in that moment of deep
sleep... If you can be aware also from the very beginning, as the mind
starts changing its waves you have to be more alert, more awake, more
watchful of what is happening and you will see that mind is by and by
falling asleep. If you can see the mind falling asleep, the one who is
seeing the mind falling asleep is your being. And that is the authentic
purpose of all meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>So these machines cannot create that awareness that awareness you
will have to create. But these machines can certainly create within ten
minutes a possibility which you may not be able to create in years of
effort. So I am not against these hi-tech instruments, I am all for
them. It is just that I want the people who are spreading those machines
around the world to know that they are doing good work, but it is
incomplete.</p><p>It will be complete only when the person in the deepest silence is
also alert, like a small flame of awareness which goes on burning.
Everything disappears, all around darkness and silence and peace, but an
unwavering flame of awareness remains.</p><p><br></p><p>If the machine can be used in the right hands and people can be
taught that the real thing will come not through the machine, the
machine can create the very essential ground in which that flame can
grow. But that flame depends on you, not on the machine.</p><p><br></p><p>So I am in favor of those machines on the one hand and on the other
hand I am very much against them, because many, many people will think,
“This is meditation.”</p><p><br></p><p>And people are getting deceived. What Maharishi Mahesh Yogi could not
do, these machines will do immense harm. He has done harm to many
people, but these machines will spread all over the world very soon. And
they are simple, there is nothing much in it. It is only a question of
creating certain waves.</p><p><br></p><p>Our musicians can learn from those machines, what waves they create,
and they can start creating those waves through their instruments. There
is no need for the machines, just the musicians can create those waves
for all of you and all of you will start falling asleep! But if you can
remain awake even in the deepest sleep, when you see that just one step
more and you will become unconscious, you have learned a secret. That
machine can be used beautifully.</p><p><br></p><p>And this is true about all machines of the world. In the right hands
they can be used tremendously for the benefit of mankind. In the wrong
hands they can become hindrances. And unfortunately, there are so many
wrong hands.…</p><p><br></p><p>Already they are spreading in America, in Europe, and better and
better mechanisms are being developed.</p><p><br></p><p>One of my sannyasins you may remember Proper Sagar. His letter has
come to me today... because he was refused entry at Bombay airport. He
could not enter India. He tried from Kathmandu there he was refused.
Because they have his name on a list at every airport around India, he
could not enter. So finally he went to Hawaii and met a woman who works
with crystals and he started working with her. The woman is old and he
proved a good, healthy young man to help her.</p><p><br></p><p>Now Proper Sagar has created a carpet. All around the carpet there
are crystals, and the carpet has electric wires running inside. And with
those electric wires he creates the same kind of wavelength. So you
don’t even have to plug your ears, you just lie down on the carpet and
the carpet does the meditation! You feel great, and Proper Sagar goes on
changing the wavelength.</p><p><br></p><p>He has sent me pictures of his carpet. This is great, but on one
carpet how many people will you be able to manage? It can be done around
the whole Buddha Hall! It is simple technology to change the wavelength,
and as the wavelength changes you will start feeling drowsy, sleepy.</p><p><br></p><p>But this is not meditation, this is a dangerous deception. If it is
not in the right hands then the person will go home thinking he has
meditated, and he has only been lying on Proper Sagar’s carpet! Neither
Proper Sagar knows what meditation is nor the carpet knows what
meditation is, but that</p><p>fellow has got the idea that he has meditated. And people are giving
money, a hundred dollars for ten minutes. Not costly... if real
meditation is available for a hundred dollars for ten minutes, I don’t
think it is costly.</p><p><br></p><p>But it is not meditation, it is simply a change of the radio waves
that are continuously moving around you in the air.</p><p><br></p><p>I think within a week the machine will be here. You can all first
experience what the machine can give you, and then I will tell you what
you can get out of the machine which the machine cannot give you, but it
can be certainly helpful as an experience. Otherwise for many people
meditation remains only a word. They think that some time they will
meditate, and there remains a doubt whether anybody meditates or
not.</p><p><br></p><p>Proper Sagar has informed me that “I am now trying, Osho, so that
even Dynamic Meditation can be done on the carpet.” And I think it is
possible, because the question is... you will be jumping on the carpet
and the carpet will be changing the electric waves in your body. And he
does not know “Yaa-Hoo” yet. Otherwise, with “Yaa- Hoo” and the magic
carpet that he has, within ten minutes... you enter inside, and after
ten minutes a Gautam Buddha goes out!</p><p><br></p><p>Just a little dance, “Yaa-Hoo” and see you in the other world! There
is no need to do it again and again.</p><p><br></p><p>But in the West the mind is mechanical, the approach is mechanical;
they want to reduce everything to a machine, and they are capable of
reducing it.</p><p><br></p><p>But there are things which are beyond the capacity of any machine.
Awareness cannot be created by any machine, it is beyond the scope of
any hi-tech. But what hi-tech can give you can certainly be used, so
when I was informed I immediately ordered that the best, the latest
machine should be sent here so I can show my people both things. I can
show them what the machine can do and tell them that this is not
meditation, and also can tell them that this can be used as a very
beautiful jumping ground into meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>And once you have tasted awareness perhaps a few times the machine
may be helpful, so it becomes more and more clear and your awareness
becomes more and more separate from the silence that the machine is
creating. Then you should start doing it without the machine. And once
you have learned to do it without the machine, the machine has helped
you immensely.</p><p><br></p><p>But people should not believe in machines too much.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard about a man who was uneducated, could not read. He went
to the optician and said, “Just look and check my eyes, because I cannot
read.”</p><p><br></p><p>So the optician said, “There is no problem, I will check and I will
give you glasses and you will be able to read.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man said, “Are you certain?”</p><p><br></p><p>The optician said, “There is no problem, I am doing it every
day.”</p><p>But the man said, “One thing you should know I am uneducated!”</p><p><br></p><p>The optician said, “Then it is very difficult. Glasses I can give
you, but education? If you don’t even recognize the alphabet then
glasses will not help. Perhaps your eyes are all right and they don’t
need glasses, but you need a certain education.”</p><p><br></p><p>But glasses can be helpful if you are able to read and your eyes are
not functioning properly. Then glasses can enhance the power, help your
eyes. And this is the situation with every machine.</p><p><br></p><p>Pradeepa, in just a few days... because in India everything takes
such a long time. The machines may have already reached Bombay airport,
but to take them out of customs is just anybody’s guess: one week, two
weeks, three weeks... Here things go so slow.</p><p><br></p><p>One of my friends... he was very old, but we had a certain deep
affinity. A case was started against him in 1915, because he had written
a book of history which was different from the books which the British
government had approved. Although he was right, the government did not
want those facts to be taught to the people because they were against
the British government.</p><p><br></p><p>So the case was against him, the publisher, the printer, the owner of
the press against four parties. And the case was so complicated, because
what he had written was absolutely factual, right; you could not just
deny it. It was self-evident. So it went on from one court to another
court, to the high court, to the supreme court. Out of four, three of
the parties died; only the writer remained.</p><p><br></p><p>His name was Pandit Sunderlal. He was really a very authentic,
sincere man. All the judges who tried his case died. All the advocates,
for or against, were gone. Because the case went on and on, even the
government which had started it was finished, in 1947. But the case
continued.</p><p><br></p><p>I inquired of him in 1975 he had become very old “When is your case
going to end?” He said, “It cannot end unless I die. Then they will
close it, but otherwise it will continue because they cannot accept
defeat and they cannot allow me to be victorious. All the facts are in
my favor, and the strangest thing is that the government that started
the case those facts were against that government that government is
gone, the country is independent. But bureaucracy works in a strange
way. Those files have to be completed, so they are not doing anything.
They simply go on postponing, and they are simply waiting for me to
die.”</p><p><br></p><p>He died and the case was closed. But for sixty years... a case that
can be decided in six hours, not more than that! But in this
country...</p><p><br></p><p>I came to know, in a family I was staying with, that they received a
letter written to their grandfather who has been dead for almost fifty
years. And the letter was sent not from a very faraway planet, but just
from a village eighty miles away. It traveled so slowly... even I
wondered how it managed to travel so slowly. Eighty miles in fifty
years?</p><p><br></p><p>But it happens in many places. Every year some case happens: some
letter has traveled for thirty- six years; a few letters never reach
they start the journey, but... Perhaps some time they will reach, but
you will not be here and neither will the person to whom you have
addressed the letter.</p><p>Files don’t move. Just go into any office and you will see on every
table, file upon file. It seems nobody is doing anything but just every
day protecting the files. And people go on bribing them: “My file pull
it out and put it first.” But they don’t know: somebody else comes and
he bribes; his file comes on top of yours. So there is nothing that you
can do, and those people go on collecting bribes.</p><p><br></p><p>In this country, bribery is not a crime, it is simply friendliness.
For centuries, India has been bribing even God. People go to the temple
and say, “If a child is born to my wife and if he is a boy, remember I
will bring one coconut and sweets as a present to you.” If this is not
bribery, then what is?</p><p><br></p><p>So the country has been traditionally accustomed to it. Nobody seems
to think that anything is wrong in it: I am doing your work, bringing
your file, which is hundreds of files down, to the top. Naturally some
prasad, some baksheesh, some friendly gesture... But then somebody else
comes, and his file... And nobody wants his table to be clean of files,
because those files are so productive. If you don’t have any file on
your table, you are a beggar; you don’t have anything.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard about a friend who became a clerk in a collectorate, and
he was a very efficient person. He managed to dispose of all the files
in one day. The collector himself told him, “You idiot! Now what are
your sources of earning? Are you thinking that you are going to live
only on your wages? Those files have been on this table... one knows not
how long. Many collectors have come and gone, the files have remained
there. They were sources of income.”</p><p><br></p><p>But now these machines will be available as sources of income. Just
as you go into a barber’s salon, you go into a meditator’s shop, give a
hundred dollars in America; in India a hundred rupees will do meditate
for ten minutes and go home. And think about yourself that you are a
great religious person.</p><p><br></p><p>Now there is a danger from these mechanisms. Soon you will see that
churches and temples and mosques will install these machines, because
otherwise they will lose their customers.</p><p><br></p><p>I have told you about a church... An old man used to come with his
grandchild and he used to sleep. That was not a problem; the problem was
that soon he would start snoring. Many times the preacher said to him,
privately, that “You are a great member of our congregation, but your
snoring disturbs many other sleepers. I have no objection, but many
people come to me and say, ‘That old man snores too much. We cannot
sleep at all. And he is such a regular person that he comes first into
the church every Sunday.’” Finally, the priest found a way. He talked to
the child. He said, “I will give you one rupee if you can keep your old
man awake.”</p><p><br></p><p>The child said, “How will I keep him awake?”</p><p><br></p><p>The priest said, “It is easy. Whenever he starts snoring, you start
hitting him. He will be angry with you, but you are getting one
rupee.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Done let us see what happens.”</p><p><br></p><p>The boy did not allow his grandfather to snore at all that day. The
old man was very angry. Many times he looked at him and he said, “You
never used to be such... what are you doing? You just listen to the
sermon.” On the way home, he said, “What is the matter? Why are you
harassing me?”</p><p>The boy said, “It is a business. The priest is giving me one rupee to
keep you awake.”</p><p><br></p><p>The old man said, “You idiot! I will give you two rupees, just let me
sleep silently. And remember, that priest will make signs towards you:
‘Wake the old man!’ Don’t bother, just go on looking at him directly
without any fear.”</p><p><br></p><p>The boy said, “I want an advance, because you always talk great
things and nothing happens.” The old man said, “This is too much. An
advance?”</p><p>He said, “Otherwise, I am going to follow the priest. He has already
given me one rupee.”</p><p><br></p><p>So the old man gave him two rupees on the second Sunday, and slept
heartily and snored as loudly as possible without any fear.</p><p><br></p><p>The priest was very much worried. He looked at the child, and the
child was sitting straight, as if he had completely forgotten. Many
times the priest made indications, but the child did not pay any
attention. So after the meeting he took the child aside and said, “You
are such a cheat! I have told you and I have given you one rupee; I was
going to give you one rupee today.”</p><p><br></p><p>The boy said, “Now one rupee will not do. My old man has given me an
advance of two rupees. Have you guts enough to give me three rupees in
advance?”</p><p><br></p><p>The priest said, “I am a poor priest, and in this competition... you
are a very nasty fellow!” He said, “Business is business. Otherwise I am
going to follow the advice of my grandfather.”</p><p>In churches, in synagogues, all is simply talk and talk, which people
have heard thousands of times, meaningless. But it is just that they
have to go there to show themselves, that they belong to the society. It
is a formality. Otherwise, people would start thinking that they were
becoming rebellious, or something was wrong. So it is a social
function.</p><p><br></p><p>As psychoanalysis became important in Western countries, and the
people who used to come for advice and confession to the priest... they
were the customers, because the priest would give them a punishment: ten
dollars, twenty dollars, whatever the coin. These same people started
going to the psychoanalyst, who was more educated, more sophisticated,
although you had to pay more too. But people’s minds are strange. If you
have to pay more, you think you are getting a really great thing. If you
have to pay nothing, you think that it does not have any
significance.</p><p><br></p><p>The psychoanalyst now earns the most in comparison to any other
profession in the whole world. And the clients are the same those who
used to confess in the Catholic Church are now confessing on the
psychoanalyst’s couch. The priests became concerned “This is
competition, and a dangerous thing; it is growing. More and more
psychoanalysts, more and more therapies, and people are disappearing
from the churches.”</p><p><br></p><p>Now it is part of every Christian missionary’s education to study
psychoanalysis. I was invited to one of their theological colleges,
which is the biggest in the East. I was surprised to see a
department</p><p>of psychoanalysis. I said, “What are you doing with psychoanalysis?
Jesus has not talked about it. In fact, he himself needed
psychoanalysis! But the Jews had no idea what to do...”</p><p><br></p><p>If Sigmund Freud had been born before Jesus and he was a Jew also
Jesus would not have been crucified. He would be lying on the couch of
Sigmund Freud, confessing that “This idea tortures me that I am the only
begotten son of God. However I try, it does not leave me. I dream about
it. Even in the waking hours, I feel I am the only begotten son of God.”
There would have been no Christianity. But fortunately, Sigmund Freud
was born two thousand years afterwards.</p><p><br></p><p>But both are Jews, both are Jewish concerns, and both are earning
more than any other firm in the world and they are competitors!</p><p><br></p><p>These machines will soon be found in every church, because otherwise
they will become competitors. They will give you a certain kind of
solace. That’s why I became interested that before the disease spreads,
we should make it clear to the world that these machines don’t give you
meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>Meditation is not something which a machine can give. But certainly
these machines can be very useful and can be used to prepare the ground
for meditation to grow. So in a way I am very favorable and in another
way I am absolutely against. What these machines can do is dangerous in
the sense that you can be deceived, you can start feeling that you are a
great meditator. You have the machine... and there are small machines
which individuals can have. There are bigger machines in which four
persons can join together. And the bigger machine, in which four persons
can meditate together, has the capacity to just go on adding more and
more earphones to it and hundreds of people can meditate together. We
will manage it here, because it has to be made clear to the world that
this is not meditation but it is a very good preparation for
meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>And once you have had a few experiences, then there is no need of</p><p><br></p><p>the machine. Then you know what happens: you can close your eyes and
you can make it happen. Then it has a beauty of its own.</p><p><br></p><p>So Pradeepa, you need not be worried. Your vipassana group is not in
danger! Now, before our meditations...</p><p>Premdipa has written:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>RECENTLY WHEN YOU HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT MEDITATION, I FEEL GUILT
ARISING IN ME FOR NOT MEDITATING.</p><p><br></p><p>And I have been telling you again and again not to feel guilty for
anything! Forget all about meditation, but there is no need to feel
guilt. Because guilt will destroy your life much more than anything
else</p><p>can. It will destroy your joy, it will destroy your love, it will
destroy your peace. And what is the reason that you don’t feel like
meditating?</p><p><br></p><p>You say, “I FEEL SO FULL WITH MY EMOTIONS, TAKING IN THE SPICES OF
LIFE AND ENJOYING JUST BEING HERE, THAT I DON’T EVEN WANT TO
MEDITATE.”</p><p><br></p><p>Who is telling you to meditate? At least you cannot blame me. All I
am saying is: enjoy life and the spices and just be here, and there is
no need of any meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>Meditation is from the same root as ‘medicine’. If you are healthy
enough, there is no need to feel guilty that you are not taking
medicine. Sick people need medicine. You are perfectly healthy, enjoying
life and its spices, enjoying just being here. That’s perfectly good.
You need not ask FORGIVE ME FOR SAYING THIS, FOR I KNOW YOU HAVE SPOKEN
SO MUCH ON THE</p><p>BEAUTY AND RELAXATION OF MEDITATION. In fact, I should ask you:
Forgive me that I have spoken so much on the beauty and relaxation of
meditation that it has created guilt in you.</p><p><br></p><p>Now you are creating guilt in me!</p><p><br></p><p>AND I HAVE EXPERIENCED GLIMPSES OF PURE ECSTASY AND UNBOUNDED JOY
THAT ARE TOTALLY INEXPRESSIBLE.</p><p><br></p><p>Great, Premdipa! Then what more meditation do you want? You already
have it. But the trouble is... you say,</p><p><br></p><p>BUT I AM ENJOYING THIS LOVE, THIS CRAZINESS HERE EVEN YOUR HEART
SURGERY SO MUCH THAT I DON’T EVEN THINK ABOUT MEDITATING.</p><p><br></p><p>Then who is writing this question?</p><p><br></p><p>I LOVE YOU WITH MY WHOLE BEING.</p><p><br></p><p>Just don’t do that. Because I am alone and you are too many and if
everybody loves me with his whole being, you will kill me! Just a poor
soul... your whole being! And ask anybody everybody loves me with his
whole being, and I have to remain hiding in my room because if somebody
comes and starts loving me with his whole being then it is the end of my
life!</p><p><br></p><p>Just a little love is enough.</p><p><br></p><p>I am a very contented man, I don’t ask much. Just a little “Yaa-Hoo”
that’s enough.</p><p>AND I CANNOT THANK YOU ENOUGH FOR EVERYTHING.</p><p><br></p><p>My god! I don’t remember that I have done anything to you!</p><p><br></p><p>BUT I HAVE NO LONGING TO PURSUE THESE GLIMPSES ANY FURTHER. CAN THIS
BE, OR AM I TOTALLY ON THE WRONG TRACK?</p><p>I hope that you are totally on the wrong track, because I don’t want
to meet somebody who loves me with his whole being, who does not want to
meditate, and who already has experiences of pure ecstasy and unbounded
joy that are totally inexpressible. And who does not want to meditate
who not only does not want to meditate, he does not even think about
it!</p><p><br></p><p>Then I am puzzled: either you are on the wrong track... or perhaps
you are cuckoo.</p><p><br></p><p>Pope the Polack is on his world pilgrimage. He stops in San Francisco
to bless the people and take part in a holy mass at the cathedral.</p><p><br></p><p>Claude, a transvestite, happens to be sitting next to the aisle as
the pope comes past on his way to the altar, swinging the incense
burner.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hey, sweetheart,” says Claude to a startled Pope the Polack, “I just
love your gown. But did you know that your handbag is on fire?”</p><p><br></p><p>You must be the same type of person.</p><p><br></p><p>Ezra Grubelberg fell out of a fourth-story window. While he is lying
flat on the ground with a big crowd around him, a policeman walks over
and asks, “What happened?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t know,” Ezra replies, “I just got here.”</p><p><br></p><p>Grandma Faginbaum walks into the pub with a parrot on her finger. She
holds it up and shouts, “I will screw the first guy who can guess the
weight of this parrot.”</p><p><br></p><p>After a long silence, a drunk in the back of the bar yells out, “Two
hundred kilos.” Grandma whirls round and says, “Close enough!”</p><p>You seem to belong to these people.</p><p><br></p><p>One night, Paddy and Sean are stumbling along some railway tracks
when Sean turns to Paddy and says, “I hate this staircase. The steps are
too far apart.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t mind that,” says Paddy, “the thing that is killing me is the
low hand-rails.”</p><p><br></p><p>Bernie Bernstein phones Goldberg and Finkelstein, the merchants. “Put
me through to Mr. Finkelstein, please,” says Bernie.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am afraid Mr. Finkelstein has gone out, sir,” replies the
secretary. “Then get me Mr. Goldberg,” says Bernie.</p><p>“I am afraid Mr. Goldberg is tied up at present,” says the girl.
“Okay,” says Bernie, “I will call back.” Ten minutes pass.</p><p>“Mr. Goldberg, please,” says Bernie.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mr. Goldberg is still tied up,” answers the girl. “I will phone
back,” says Bernie. Half an hour later... “Get me Mr. Goldberg,” demands
Bernie.</p><p>“I am terribly sorry, sir,” says the girl, “but Mr. Goldberg is still
tied up.” “I will phone back,” snaps Bernie. And another half hour
passes.</p><p>“Get me Goldberg!” shouts Bernie.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have got dreadful news, sir,” says the girl, “Mr. Goldberg is
still tied up.”</p><p><br></p><p>“My god,” screams Bernie. “This is ridiculous! How can you run a
business this way? One partner is out all day and the other is tied up
for hours on end. What is going on there?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, you see, sir,” explains the secretary, “whenever
Mr. Finkelstein goes out, he ties up Mr. Goldberg.”</p><p><br></p><p>It is the mailman’s last day on the job, and he is feeling mixed
emotions. On the one hand he is glad to be retiring, but on the other
hand he will miss seeing the beautiful young married woman he has
fancied for the last few years.</p><p><br></p><p>He is shocked and delighted when she opens her door for this last
time, wearing a see-through gown, and invites him in. She drags him up
to the bedroom and makes passionate love to him.</p><p><br></p><p>Afterwards she cooks him a delicious breakfast. When he is about to
leave, the young woman goes to her purse, takes out a dollar bill and
gives it to him.</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t understand,” says the satisfied mailman. “You are going to
pay me as well?”</p><p><br></p><p>“It was my husband’s idea,” the woman explains, “when I told him you
were retiring and suggested we give you something, he said ‘Screw him,
give him a dollar’.”</p><p><br></p><p>“The breakfast,” she adds proudly, “was my idea.” Okay, Maneesha?</p><p>Yes, Osho.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part9>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

PLEASE COMMENT.\nPrem Joyce,\nThe first and the most important thing to remember is that reflecting is not going to help at all. ‘Reflecting’ is nothing but a beautiful word for ‘thinking’. The blind man can go on thinking about light, he can arrive at certain conclusions too, but those conclusions cannot be right. Howsoever right they appear to be, they are bound to be false, untrue.\nThe moon in the sky is one thing and the moon reflected in the silent lake is totally another. One exists, the other is only a reflection. If you jump into the silent lake you will not be able to catch hold of the moon; on the contrary, you may even disturb the reflection because the lake will be disturbed.\nThe more you think, the more you are creating waves and ripples in the mind. The real thing for the blind man to do is not to think about light but to heal his eyes, for the deaf man, not to reflect on music but to go through some alchemical processes which can make him hear.\nThat’s the difference between reflection and meditation: meditation opens your eyes, reflection is thinking with closed eyes. Meditation is seeing and thinking is remaining blind. But thinking can give you great conclusions, very logical too; in fact only thinking can give you logical conclusions. Meditation will give you very paradoxical experiences – illogical or supralogical, but never logical.\nExistence consists of contradictions – it is vast enough to contain all contradictions – it consists of polar opposites. They appear to be opposites to the logical mind, but they are complementaries deep down in reality. They exist together in a kind of simultaneity.\nIn English ‘meditation’ again has the same flavour as ‘reflection’. In English there is no word which can be said to be the equivalent of dhyana or zen, so we have to use the word ‘meditation’; that comes closest. But a few conditions have to be put upon it.\nThe moment you use the word ‘meditation’, the immediate question arises ‘On what?’ because ‘meditation’ in the English language means meditating upon something. And the words dhyana, or zen, simply mean emptying yourself of all thinking; it is not a question of meditating upon something. Meditation is a state of absolute silence, of profound peace, of not thinking at all but just being aware. Only in that awareness will you be able to see the truth.\nYou say, Prem Joyce: I HAVE BEEN REFLECTING ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ‘FEELING SORRY’ FOR SOMEONE AND ‘HAVING COMPASSION.’\nAnd you can immediately see the difficulty: ‘feeling sorry’ for someone and ‘having compassion’ are exactly the same. The person who knows what compassion is cannot say ‘I have compassion’; he is simply compassionate. Having compassion is not possible – either you are compassionate or you are not; it is not a question of having. If you have compassion, it is the same, in different words, as feeling sorry for someone.\nBut language can give you great scope for playing games, mind games. ‘Feeling sorry’ and ‘having compassion’ are synonymous. Of course, feeling sorry and having compassion are synonymous, but feeling sorry and being compassionate are not synonymous. Being compassionate is a totally different phenomenon than having compassion. Having compassion, again you will have that idea that ‘I am far superior than the other. Look how much compassion I have!’ And compassion is not something that you can possess, it is not something that you can have, you can only be it. Know the difference between having and being!\nBut you have been groping, and something significant has arisen out of your groping.\nYou say: IT SEEMS TO ME THAT TO BE SORRY FOR SOMEONE HAS AN ELEMENT OF CONDESCENSION IN IT, AS IF YOU WERE SUPERIOR TO THE OTHER...\nYes, even the blind man can grope for the door and can sometimes find it, but still he will not be able to see it. It is just accidental, that’s why you are not certain. Seeing has absolute certainty about it. Seeing is knowing, and knowing is not approximate.\nYou say: IT SEEMS TO ME...\nNaturally, if you are reflecting, at the most it can only seem to you that ‘This is the door... perhaps this is the door.’ The ‘perhaps’ will always surround you, and with the perhaps one is in a kind of bondage: there will be ifs and buts, you will never be on certain ground. And without being on certain ground you cannot be centred: there will remain some wavering – maybe it is so, maybe it is not so.\nYou say: IT SEEMS TO ME THAT TO BE SORRY FOR SOMEONE HAS AN ELEMENT OF CONDESCENSION IN IT...\nIt has! There is no question of being uncertain about it. In fact, people enjoy being sorry for others. They are always looking for situations where they can feel sorry for others – it is so ego-fulfilling, it is such a nourishment for the ego. If somebody’s house is on fire you go with tears in your eyes and you show great sympathy, you show much concern, as if you are immensely pained. But deep down, if you watch, you will find a certain joy, a certain glee.\nBut people never look within themselves. It is bound to be there, for two reasons: it is not your house which is on fire, ‘Thank God!’ – that is the first thing. Secondly, you must be enjoying your tears, because when somebody builds a new house, a beautiful house, you feel jealous; great envy arises in you. You cannot enjoy, you cannot participate in his joy. You want to avoid – you don’t even look at his house.\nI used to go to Calcutta where I would stay in a very beautiful house. And the man who was the owner of the house was immensely concerned about the house. He was very rich, one of the richest men in Calcutta, and he had no children. So just the wife and the husband were there with nothing else to do but maintain the house, the garden and the lawns with great care, and whenever I came he would take me around to show me what new things they had done.\nThe last time I went, he didn’t talk about the house, the garden, the swimming pool. I was puzzled – that was so abnormal for him. Twenty-four hours passed and the house was not mentioned at all: the new paintings that he had acquired and the new ‘antique’ furniture – the new antique furniture! – and how much it had cost him. And he was looking a little bit sad too.\nI asked, ‘What is the matter? You look very sad!’\nHe said, ‘Yes, I am sad.’ He took me out onto the lawn and showed me a house in the neighbourhood – a new house had been built and he said, ‘Unless I can defeat this man I will remain sad!’\nThe neighbour invited me for lunch. He also wanted the owner of the house, my host, to come with me, but he immediately refused. I had to go alone.\nWhen I came back he said, ‘Don’t take any note of my refusal. I cannot go into that house. Unless I make a bigger house than him I cannot go there! It hurts! I am feeling humiliated.’\nIf you cannot participate in the joy of others, how can you feel sorry when they are in trouble? If you feel jealous when they are joyful, then you will feel joyful when they are in trouble. But you will not show it, you will show sympathy. ‘Sympathy’ is not a good word.\nThere are a few words that are very ugly but which are now very respected; words like ‘duty’, ‘service’, ‘sympathy’ – these are ugly words. A man who is fulfilling his duty is not a man of love. A\nman who is doing service knows nothing of love, because service is not done, it happens. And the man who sympathizes is certainly enjoying some kind of superiority: ‘I am not in that sorry state, the other is in the sorry state. I have the upper hand – I can feel sorry for him.’\nI lived in Jabalpur for twenty years. The richest man in Jabalpur used to come to me once in a while. He said one day ‘One thing troubles me always: I have been helping all of my relatives, even faraway relatives, I have made them all rich in every possible way, but nobody feels friendly towards me. In fact, I feel a certain antagonism from all of my relatives. Why is it so? I have done so much for them, and there was no need for me to do anything for them. I did it out of love, but they feel antagonistic.’\nI said, ‘I know your relatives – they also visit me – and I know that they are antagonistic to you. The reason is very simple: you have never allowed them to do anything for you. You have always been doing things for them and you have never allowed them to do even a small thing for you – you have not even asked them to bring you a rose flower – so they are all feeling humiliated. And it is not love that you are talking about, it is just ego: “I have done so much!” You want to show them that “I have done so much and I don’t need anybody to do anything for me”; that’s why there is antagonism. Of course, you have done it with good intentions, but intentions don’t count. The unconscious desire for ego fulfilment, for ego gratification is hurting them.’\nI said to him, ‘Once in a while give them a chance. I know that you don’t need anything, but they have beautiful gardens and you can tell them, “Sometimes bring roses for me.” Sometimes when you fall ill you can ask them to come and just sit by your side, and they will all feel happy. Just small things! Sometimes you can tell them, “Invite me to supper, to dinner,” and they will be immensely overjoyed; they will not feel antagonism.’\nHe said, ‘That I cannot do – that is impossible. That is against my nature.’\nSo I told him, ‘Then it is absolutely clear now – even you can see it – why all your good deeds have brought antagonism!’\nThese do-gooders are mischievous people. They do good, but their desire is just the opposite of it.\nPrem Joyce, the idea of feeling superior to the other is present in both cases, whether you feel sorry or you have compassion.\nAnd you say:... AND THAT IT DOES NOT NECESSARILY HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH LOVE...\nCertainly it does not necessarily have anything to do with love – not only that, it is anti-love because it is an ego trip and ego can never be in tune with love. Ego is poison to love, it is necessarily anti-love. Your compassion is not out of love if some desire of being superior is being fulfilled by it.\nThe lover never feels superior – the lover cannot feel superior, the lover cannot even think that he has obliged anybody. On the contrary, when somebody receives your love you feel obliged that your love was not rejected – it could have been rejected – that your love was respected, welcomed. You feel obliged, you feel thankful, you feel grateful.\nAnd you say:... WHEREAS COMPASSION MUST BE AN INTEGRAL PART OF LOVING.\nNo, compassion is higher than love. Love is an integral part of compassion, but compassion is not an integral part of love. That’s the difference between thinking and meditation.\nThese three things are to be taken note of: the lowest love is sex – it is physical – and the highest refinement of love is compassion. Sex is below love, compassion is above love – love is exactly in the middle.\nVery few people know what love is. Ninety-nine percent of people, unfortunately, think sexuality is love – it is not. Sexuality is very animal; it certainly has the potential of growing into love, but it is not actual love, only a potential.\nA seed is not a flower. It can become a flower, but there is no certainty, no guarantee that it is going to become a flower – it may die as a seed. If you put it on a rock it will not sprout into a bush, into a flowering tree, it will die. If you throw it into fire it Will die.\nSex has the potential of love, but only the potential, remember; it is the seed. There is no need to deny it because if you throw away the seed, if you deny the seed, then love disappears.\nThat’s why in the so-called religious people you will not find love and its warmth, you will find them cold, dead, without love Yes, they will have compassion, they will feel sorry for you, because you are hell-bound and they are going to heaven. Naturally they feel sorry for you: ‘Poor souls!’ You will suffer hell-fire and they will be enjoying the pleasures of heaven.\nThere is no love at all, but they have compassion. And having compassion is a pseudo thing, it is not the true compassion. They have denied sex, and in denying sex they have denied love.\nSex has to be used in the right perspective. It has not to be repressed, it has not to be denied, and you are not to remain confined to it either. No repression, no indulgence. The path is very subtle.\nJesus says: The path is straight but very narrow. It is a razor’s edge.\nSex either becomes indulgence, as it has become in the West, or it becomes repressed, as it has become in the East. On one side there is a well, on the other side there is a ditch, and you can fall in. You have to walk between the two. Certainly it is a razor’s edge, tight-rope walking; you have to remain very balanced.\nAnd the functioning of the mind is such that it moves from one pole to the other. It is exactly like the pendulum of an old clock: it goes from right to left, the extreme left, and from the extreme left again to the extreme right.\nAnd remember the law: as you see the pendulum moving towards the left it is gaining momentum to go to the right; while it is actually going towards the right it is gaining momentum to go to the left. So don’t be deceived by what you see; something inside is growing which is just the opposite of what you are seeing.\nThe repressed person is always ready to go into indulgence. All the repressed societies are boiling, ready to go into indulgence, and they find ways and means to go into indulgence.\nFor example, this country has repressed sex for thousands of years, and the natural outcome has been a backdoor indulgence. In Indian temples prostitutes have existed. In the South still, even today in the twentieth century, temples have prostitutes. They are not called prostitutes – Indians are very clever at giving beautiful names to ugly things – they are called DEVADASIS, ‘servants of God’. And who are these gods? First the priest who initiates them into sexual indulgence and then the rich clients who come to the temple. These are the gods whom they serve! But they are supposed to serve the stone statue of the god inside the temple. That is just a facade. In India prostitution can now exist only in a religious garb – sex has been such a taboo that you have to find some way to make it religious.\nTemples like Khajuraho, Konarak, Puri have not existed anywhere in the West. There is no need people are already indulging – they are indulging by the front door – so there is no need to go by the back door.\nIt is not a coincidence that the first treatise on sex was written in India. What Sigmund Freud, Wilhelm Reich Masters and Johnson, and other sex researchers have done is nothing compared to Vatsayana’s sutras, the KAMA SUTRA – sex sutras – and they are three thousand years old.\nAfter the birth of every great religion in India, Tantra entered by the back door. Nothing but sexuality in a rationalized form – ninety-nine percent of it is sexuality. There is Buddhist Tantra. Buddha could not have conceived of it, that his followers were going to make sex a religious ritual. But what can people do? If you repress them too much then they have to find ways, otherwise they will be continuously burning with desire.\nHindu Tantra... very ugly. If you just look at the Tantra paintings you will be surprised. These are the people who say that I am destroying their culture! And what kind of culture do they have? – Khajuraho and Tantra treatises and Vatsayana’s KAMA SUTRA and Pundit Koka’s KOKA SHASTRA. What culture do they have?\nAll this nonsense has happened because sex was repressed. In the West sex became indulgence. Both are wrong. But that’s how the mind is: it always goes from the frying pan to the fire! It cannot stay in the middle, because to stay in the middle is the death of the mind.\nThat’s what I call meditation: if you can stay exactly in the middle, the clock stops. If the pendulum stays in the middle, if you hold the pendulum in the middle, the clock stops. And if you hold yourself exactly in the middle, if you avoid the extreme and hold to the axis, suddenly you will see that the mind has stopped. Mind functions almost like a clock.\nSex is a potential, a great potential. If you become aware and alert, meditative, then sex can be transformed into love. And if your meditativeness becomes total, absolute, love can be transformed into compassion.\nSex is the seed, love is the flower, compassion is the fragrance.\nCompassion has love as one of its ingredients, but not vice versa – love is not compassionate. You can see it everywhere: lovers are continuously fighting. They are intimate enemies, continuously at each other’s throats. Yes, once in a while, just to rest, they are loving too, but those love-breaks are\nfew and far between; otherwise there is constant struggle, fight. The woman is nagging – that is her way of fighting – and the man is always ready to hit hard on the woman’s head. In fact, people think that when you don’t fight, your love has died.\nPsychologists also agree with these fools. They say that it you don’t fight that means you are not interested, if you don’t fight that simply means it does not matter; if it matters then you have to fight. Lovers are fighting – there is no compassion there is cruelty. And you can see that cruelty in their love-making also.\nFor thousands of years people have been making love in the dark for the simple reason that it looks ridiculous, aggressive. Lovers are not related in a compassionate way, it is a fight to grab as much as possible: to give as little as possible and to get as much as possible. It is a bargain, it is a business. People art forcing each other to give love in every possible way, direct and indirect. It is cruelty, it is violence, it is aggression.\nOnce in a while it has happened that lovers have killed each other. That seems to be the extreme form of love, just the very climax! They bite, they scratch with their nails. Vatsayana says these are methods of love – scratching the beloved with your nails and biting your beloved so that blood comes! These are ‘love methods’, ‘love techniques’! Vatsayana must have been some kind of sadist, but Indians call him a rishi, a seer – a maharishi, a great seer. He must have been like Maharishi Mahesh Yogi – a great seer! And all this nonsense he is writing, giving techniques... It is called ‘love-bite’, ‘love-scratch’. And he says it makes love-making very deep, profound.\nYou must have heard about de Sade from whose name ‘sadism’ has been coined. De Sade seems to have been the greatest lover in the world! He used to carry a suitcase with him, just like a doctor’s suitcase, with all the instruments. Of course he was far more modern than Vatsayana. Why scratch with your nails if you can have beautiful instruments to scratch with? Why bite with your teeth if you can have devices? And as a Western man, technology-oriented, he had all kinds of instruments in his bag.\nHe had a beautiful personality – women became attracted to him – he was very rich, he was a marquis. But once a woman entered his love chamber – it was called a ‘love chamber’ in fact it should be called ‘torture chamber’ – he would immediately lock the door. The woman would be puzzled because on all the walls there were other, bigger instruments – whips and all kinds of things. And then he would undress the woman and start beating her.\nThe women who had been in love with him – of course they never dared to go again, once was enough – even confessed before the court... Almost all the women, because he had made love to many women, hundreds – he was rich enough to pay – confessed in court that the way he made love to them was always dangerous and they were very scared, but they never had such beautiful orgasms either before or after.\nAnd de Sade writes in his memoirs that when you beat a woman she becomes really aroused, when you whip her she becomes alive, warm. Certainly, obviously!\nLovers don’t have compassion for each other. You may not be a de Sade, but every lover is on the way to it. De Sade may be the goal, but very few reach to that height.\nPrem Joyce, love has no ingredient of compassion in it. Vice versa is true – compassion certainly has love in it – but because of compassion that love has a totally different quality, a different flavour.\nThe word ‘compassion’ has to be understood: when passion is transformed it is called compassion, when passion goes through an absolute transformation it is compassion. Love is a stage on the way but not the end.\nBuddha has defined compassion as ‘love plus meditation’. When your love is not just a desire for the other, when your love is not only a need, when your love is a sharing, when your love is not that of a beggar but that of an emperor, when your love is not asking for something in return but is ready only to give – to give for the sheer joy of giving – then add meditation to it and the pure fragrance is released, the imprisoned splendour is released. That is compassion; compassion is the highest phenomenon.\nSex is animal, love is human, compassion is divine. Sex is physical, love is psychological, compassion is spiritual.\nAnd let me remind you again that it is not ‘having compassion’, it is being compassion. You can have sex, you can ‘have’ love – though you ‘have’ it less than sex – but you cannot have compassion. You become compassion, your very being is compassion. Walking, you are compassionate, sitting, you are compassionate, sleeping, you are compassionate. Whether anybody is there or not does not matter: your compassion is just like a flame – it goes on burning in absolute aloneness, radiating. If somebody passes by he can have it, with no strings attached, with no conditions. Compassion is the experience of the Buddhas, of the awakened.\nYou cannot reflect on these matters. Stop reflecting, don’t waste your energy in reflecting. Put the whole energy into meditation. Become silent, aware, watchful, and in that watchfulness miracles happen. And everybody is entitled to this miracle of becoming compassion. It is our birthright!\nThe second question Question 2\nOSHO,\nTHE OTHER DAY YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT HUGGING AND KISSING AS AN EXPRESSION OF FREEDOM. AFTER DISCOURSE AN INDIAN SANNYASIN WAS SWAYING AND HUGGING A WESTERN WOMAN SANNYASIN AND IT LOOKED SO UGLY TO SEE. IT DID NOT FEEL AT ALL LIKE LOVE. IT SEEMED THAT HE WAS TRYING TO UTILIZE THE WORD ‘FREEDOM’ AS A RESULT OF YOUR DISCOURSE.\nYoga Vidya,\nThe Indian mind is in a very perverted state. Here, my Indian sannyasins comprise three categories. The first, the best, have come here for spiritual growth, they have come to inquire about truth, about meditation, about freedom, about God. The second kind are very repressed. They have not come to inquire about freedom, truth, liberation, meditation; they are boiling with repression – which is the\nnormal state of the Indian society outside. They have come here just to use this freedom that I am giving to my people. Of course their love will look ugly because it is not love, it is simply perverted sex – it is sex standing on its head. And the third category consists only of curious people who have not come because of any reason, just to see what is happening. They come and go; they are not the problem.\nBut the problem is that they come and only see the second type of Indian – hugging and kissing in an ugly way – and they spread rumours all over the country about what is happening here. They don’t see the best Indians who are really in tune with me.\nNinety percent of my sannyasins – Indian sannyasins, I mean – belong to the first category, the best people. Nine percent belong to the second category: the ugly people, the fools. They have not come here for me. Some have come because there are so many beautiful women around, some have come to cheat, to borrow money, to steal. We are trying to throw them out, but still a few somehow manage to get in. They even meditate to show that they are meditators, but their real motives are totally different.\nSo, Vidya, whenever you find that any Indian sannyasin is misusing the freedom available here, throw him out immediately and ban him!\nWhen two Westerners are hugging each other there is a beauty in it, because they are not coming from a repressed society. They have not come here just to hug! They could have hugged far better in the West; there was no need to come thousands of miles to this dirty place, Poona, to be sick with hepatitis and amoebas and dengue fever and suffer all kinds of troubles – to be raped by Indians, to be killed by people, to be murdered, beaten. They have not come here just to hug and kiss – that is beautifully available in the West – they have come here to seek and search for something which is not available there. So when they are hugging each other there is no sex involved in it; it is just a sharing.\nBut the Indian stupids who are here – that nine percent – are only here to hug and kiss. Poor fellows! They even have to meditate, they have to do vipassana, they go through all kinds of tortures... because these are tortures for them! But they suffer all these tortures.\nAnd this is my experience: that the Western people are far more innocent – naturally, because they come from a richer society, an affluent, free society without any taboos. They are innocent, childlike, and they easily become involved with these cunning people, these cunning Indians.\nI want my Western sannyasins also to be a little watchful and aware. Avoid these ugly people! These people are not the right people to commune with. And to all the guards and to the office I would like to say that whenever you find some ugly thing happening here, immediately throw the person out.\nThe freedom is for beauty – for anything beautiful there is freedom, but not for ugly things to happen. They should not be allowed, at least not in my commune. My commune has to live up to the highest standards of beauty, love, compassion, meditation.\nBut because we are in India and once in a while somebody is bound to get in, be a little alert and careful. Immediately stop such people from entering the ashram – I don’t want to have anything to\ndo with such people. And freedom certainly can be misused too. Only freedom can be misused; if there is no freedom, then there is no question of any misuse.\nThat’s why societies have not allowed freedom, they have made a very strict discipline for people, they have made a very repressed structure around people for the simple reason that freedom is dangerous; it can be misused. Slavery cannot be misused – what can the slave do?\nIndians live in absolute slavery outside this ashram, and when they come in of course they are coming with all kinds of scorpions and snakes and dogs within them and they start freeing all kinds of repressed, perverted desires, because they have never seen such freedom.\nFreedom can be used only by people who are very aware. Repressed people cannot use it; they are bound to misuse it.\nI have heard many other stories about this Indian, whosoever he is. If he has any sense he should immediately stop doing such acts, or if he cannot then this is not the place for him. He should leave, otherwise he will be thrown out. I know the name of the person, but I will not say the name here – he will understand. So, whosoever it may concern...\nThe last question Question 3 OSHO,\nWHAT SHOULD BE DONE SO THAT PEOPLE CAN UNDERSTAND YOU? I FEEL VERY SAD TO SEE SO MUCH MISUNDERSTANDING ABOUT YOU AND YOUR TEACHINGS.\nAnanto,\nIn a way it is natural. It is not unusual, it is to be expected that people will misunderstand me. They have always misunderstood the truth, the naked truth. And they are very slow, so they always get the joke very late.\nThey started understanding Buddha when he was dead, they started understanding Socrates when they themselves had killed him, they started having respect for Jesus when they had crucified him – they themselves! Now they remember with great respect the names of Al-Hillaj Mansur and Sarmad, whom they themselves destroyed.\nPeople are very slow to understand.\nRecently a letter of Gauguin’s sold for over five thousand dollars.\nIn it the painter complained of his poverty, that he was starving to death.\nNow the letter is sold for five thousand dollars, and in the letter the painter is complaining that he is starving – starving to death! People are strange! They take such a long time to understand.\nVincent van Gogh’s paintings are worshipped now all over the world. Now they say that he was one of the greatest painters ever, but while he was alive not a single painting was sold. Now each painting is valued nearabout one million dollars, and only two hundred paintings are in existence. If he was alive now he would have been the richest man, but he was so poor while he was alive that he would only eat three days a week.\nHe used to get enough money from his brother to eat the cheapest food for the whole week, but he had to save some money for canvases and paints and colours and brushes, so he had to starve for four days to save a little money.\nHe committed suicide when he was only thirty-three, just because it was so difficult to survive. Nobody would accept his paintings; there was no question of anybody purchasing them. People even refused to accept his paintings for hanging in their houses. He would present his paintings free to people and they threw them in the basement or somewhere else.\nHis brother, thinking that he was feeling so sad because he had not sold a single painting in his life, sent one man with some money to go and purchase one painting.\nThe man went. Van Gogh could not believe his ears that there should be one man in the whole world who was ready to purchase his paintings, so he showed them with great interest. But the man was not interested in the paintings at all. He said, ‘Any painting will do. You keep this money and give me the painting.’\nImmediately he understood what the matter was. He said, ‘Forget about purchasing the painting! It seems my brother has sent you, so take this money back. It is better to die without selling a painting!’\nAnd the same day he committed suicide – it was enough. He painted nearabout one thousand paintings; eight hundred paintings have been lost because people never cared about them. When his paintings started becoming famous after his death, people started searching for his paintings. They were found in all kinds of places – people’s basements, bathrooms. And they were easily purchased; people were very willing to give them away for a little money or even for no money. Now each single painting is valued at one million dollars.\nThat’s how people have always functioned, so there is nothing unnatural about it. People have their own understanding...\nTwo kids were talking. ‘What are you going to ask Santa Claus to give you for Christmas?’ ‘I want an astronaut’s suit. And you?’\n‘I want a tampon.’\n‘A tampon? What’s that?’\n‘I don’t know, but on the TV they say that with it you can travel everywhere, swim, play...’\nNow, small children are small children – they have their understanding! Now this ‘tampon’ is something magical: you can travel anywhere, everywhere, swim, play – do whatsoever you want.\nThe apples on a farmer’s tree had just ripened. The owner put a notice under the tree which said, ‘Don’t steal! God is watching you!’\nThe day after, the farmer found his apple tree had been picked bare. On the notice the thief had added a few more words: ‘But he is not a spy!’\nTwo members of the Town Council began shouting at each other. ‘You are the biggest idiot in the world!’ the first shouted.\n‘And you are the most bigoted and prejudiced donkey in town!’ the other man yelled.\nThe mayor, who was presiding, banged his gavel and said, ‘Quiet, gentlemen, quiet please. I’m afraid that in your excitement you have forgotten that I am in the room too!’\nThe psychiatrist was talking to his patient. ‘Well,’ he said, ‘your problem has sexual origins. I have to ask you something about your sexual behaviour. Do you talk to your husband while making love?’\n‘Well... yes,’ answered the woman. ‘I mean, only if there happens to be a telephone nearby!’\nA man called on his lawyer and said, ‘I want to sue that man who lives across the street from me. He called me a hippopotamus!’\n‘We can do that,’ the lawyer said. ‘When did he call you that?’ ‘Six years ago,’ the man replied.\n‘Six years ago!’ the lawyer exclaimed. ‘Why have you waited so long to file suit against him?’\n‘Well,’ the man said, ‘yesterday I took the kids to the zoo and it was the first time I had ever seen a hippopotamus!’\nAnanto, you ask me: WHAT SHOULD BE DONE SO THAT PEOPLE CAN UNDERSTAND YOU?\nIn fact, nothing can be done. If you understand me, live that understanding, that’s all. If somebody is ready to understand it, good. If nobody is ready to understand it, that is nothing to bother about, that is their business. Don’t become too concerned about others because that concern will disturb your own growth. Grow according to your inner light, and if you are full of light maybe some people will start understanding.\nIf my sannyasins start living exactly what I mean, then that’s enough. A few people will certainly understand you, and only a few are capable of understanding it; the larger mob is incapable of understanding anything that goes beyond them. But that is their freedom. If they don’t want to understand, it has not to be forced upon them.\nA drunk was weaving around the bar of an exclusive hotel. He asked the barman the way to the men’s toilet and he was told that it was the first door on the right down the hall. So he blundered through the first door on the left and fell into the swimming pool.\nHe had been treading water for well over five minutes when the door opened. ‘For God’s sake!’ he screamed. ‘Don’t flush it yet!’\nAnd the really last question Question 4\nOSHO,\nDO YOU TAKE YOURSELF SERIOUSLY?\nRishiraj,\nNever! Seriousness and I have nothing in common; there is no bridge between me and seriousness. Did you hear the latest joke, Rishiraj?\nOsho goes to the psychiatrist. Says the psychiatrist, ‘This is the first time you have come to me, so please tell me your story from the very beginning.’\nReplies Osho, ‘In the beginning, I created the sky and the earth...’\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"6353","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/zen_zest_zip_zap_and_zing/part3/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/zen_zest_zip_zap_and_zing/>Zen.

SOMEONE AND ‘HAVING COMPASSION’. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT TO BE SORRY FOR
SOMEONE HAS AN ELEMENT OF CONDESCENSION IN IT, AS IF YOU WERE SUPERIOR
TO THE OTHER, AND THAT IT DOES NOT NECESSARILY HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH
LOVE, WHEREAS COMPASSION MUST BE AN INTEGRAL PART OF LOVING. PLEASE
COMMENT.</p><p><br></p><p>Prem Joyce,</p><p><br></p><p>The first and the most important thing to remember is that reflecting
is not going to help at all. ‘Reflecting’ is nothing but a beautiful
word for ‘thinking’. The blind man can go on thinking about light, he
can arrive at certain conclusions too, but those conclusions cannot be
right. Howsoever right they appear to be, they are bound to be false,
untrue.</p><p><br></p><p>The moon in the sky is one thing and the moon reflected in the silent
lake is totally another. One exists, the other is only a reflection. If
you jump into the silent lake you will not be able to catch hold of the
moon; on the contrary, you may even disturb the reflection because the
lake will be disturbed.</p><p><br></p><p>The more you think, the more you are creating waves and ripples in
the mind. The real thing for the blind man to do is not to think about
light but to heal his eyes, for the deaf man, not to reflect on music
but to go through some alchemical processes which can make him hear.</p><p>That’s the difference between reflection and meditation: meditation
opens your eyes, reflection is thinking with closed eyes. Meditation is
seeing and thinking is remaining blind. But thinking can give you great
conclusions, very logical too; in fact only thinking can give you
logical conclusions. Meditation will give you very paradoxical
experiences – illogical or supralogical, but never logical.</p><p><br></p><p>Existence consists of contradictions – it is vast enough to contain
all contradictions – it consists of polar opposites. They appear to be
opposites to the logical mind, but they are complementaries deep down in
reality. They exist together in a kind of simultaneity.</p><p><br></p><p>In English ‘meditation’ again has the same flavour as ‘reflection’.
In English there is no word which can be said to be the equivalent of
dhyana or zen, so we have to use the word ‘meditation’; that comes
closest. But a few conditions have to be put upon it.</p><p><br></p><p>The moment you use the word ‘meditation’, the immediate question
arises ‘On what?’ because ‘meditation’ in the English language means
meditating upon something. And the words dhyana, or zen, simply mean
emptying yourself of all thinking; it is not a question of meditating
upon something. Meditation is a state of absolute silence, of profound
peace, of not thinking at all but just being aware. Only in that
awareness will you be able to see the truth.</p><p><br></p><p>You say, Prem Joyce: I HAVE BEEN REFLECTING ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
‘FEELING SORRY’ FOR SOMEONE AND ‘HAVING COMPASSION.’</p><p><br></p><p>And you can immediately see the difficulty: ‘feeling sorry’ for
someone and ‘having compassion’ are exactly the same. The person who
knows what compassion is cannot say ‘I have compassion’; he is simply
compassionate. Having compassion is not possible – either you are
compassionate or you are not; it is not a question of having. If you
have compassion, it is the same, in different words, as feeling sorry
for someone.</p><p><br></p><p>But language can give you great scope for playing games, mind games.
‘Feeling sorry’ and ‘having compassion’ are synonymous. Of course,
feeling sorry and having compassion are synonymous, but feeling sorry
and being compassionate are not synonymous. Being compassionate is a
totally different phenomenon than having compassion. Having compassion,
again you will have that idea that ‘I am far superior than the other.
Look how much compassion I have!’ And compassion is not something that
you can possess, it is not something that you can have, you can only be
it. Know the difference between having and being!</p><p><br></p><p>But you have been groping, and something significant has arisen out
of your groping.</p><p><br></p><p>You say: IT SEEMS TO ME THAT TO BE SORRY FOR SOMEONE HAS AN ELEMENT
OF CONDESCENSION IN IT, AS IF YOU WERE SUPERIOR TO THE OTHER...</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, even the blind man can grope for the door and can sometimes find
it, but still he will not be able to see it. It is just accidental,
that’s why you are not certain. Seeing has absolute certainty about it.
Seeing is knowing, and knowing is not approximate.</p><p><br></p><p>You say: IT SEEMS TO ME...</p><p>Naturally, if you are reflecting, at the most it can only seem to you
that ‘This is the door... perhaps this is the door.’ The ‘perhaps’ will
always surround you, and with the perhaps one is in a kind of bondage:
there will be ifs and buts, you will never be on certain ground. And
without being on certain ground you cannot be centred: there will remain
some wavering – maybe it is so, maybe it is not so.</p><p><br></p><p>You say: IT SEEMS TO ME THAT TO BE SORRY FOR SOMEONE HAS AN ELEMENT
OF CONDESCENSION IN IT...</p><p><br></p><p>It has! There is no question of being uncertain about it. In fact,
people enjoy being sorry for others. They are always looking for
situations where they can feel sorry for others – it is so
ego-fulfilling, it is such a nourishment for the ego. If somebody’s
house is on fire you go with tears in your eyes and you show great
sympathy, you show much concern, as if you are immensely pained. But
deep down, if you watch, you will find a certain joy, a certain
glee.</p><p><br></p><p>But people never look within themselves. It is bound to be there, for
two reasons: it is not your house which is on fire, ‘Thank God!’ – that
is the first thing. Secondly, you must be enjoying your tears, because
when somebody builds a new house, a beautiful house, you feel jealous;
great envy arises in you. You cannot enjoy, you cannot participate in
his joy. You want to avoid – you don’t even look at his house.</p><p><br></p><p>I used to go to Calcutta where I would stay in a very beautiful
house. And the man who was the owner of the house was immensely
concerned about the house. He was very rich, one of the richest men in
Calcutta, and he had no children. So just the wife and the husband were
there with nothing else to do but maintain the house, the garden and the
lawns with great care, and whenever I came he would take me around to
show me what new things they had done.</p><p><br></p><p>The last time I went, he didn’t talk about the house, the garden, the
swimming pool. I was puzzled – that was so abnormal for him. Twenty-four
hours passed and the house was not mentioned at all: the new paintings
that he had acquired and the new ‘antique’ furniture – the new antique
furniture! – and how much it had cost him. And he was looking a little
bit sad too.</p><p><br></p><p>I asked, ‘What is the matter? You look very sad!’</p><p><br></p><p>He said, ‘Yes, I am sad.’ He took me out onto the lawn and showed me
a house in the neighbourhood – a new house had been built and he said,
‘Unless I can defeat this man I will remain sad!’</p><p><br></p><p>The neighbour invited me for lunch. He also wanted the owner of the
house, my host, to come with me, but he immediately refused. I had to go
alone.</p><p><br></p><p>When I came back he said, ‘Don’t take any note of my refusal. I
cannot go into that house. Unless I make a bigger house than him I
cannot go there! It hurts! I am feeling humiliated.’</p><p><br></p><p>If you cannot participate in the joy of others, how can you feel
sorry when they are in trouble? If you feel jealous when they are
joyful, then you will feel joyful when they are in trouble. But you will
not show it, you will show sympathy. ‘Sympathy’ is not a good word.</p><p><br></p><p>There are a few words that are very ugly but which are now very
respected; words like ‘duty’, ‘service’, ‘sympathy’ – these are ugly
words. A man who is fulfilling his duty is not a man of love. A</p><p>man who is doing service knows nothing of love, because service is
not done, it happens. And the man who sympathizes is certainly enjoying
some kind of superiority: ‘I am not in that sorry state, the other is in
the sorry state. I have the upper hand – I can feel sorry for him.’</p><p><br></p><p>I lived in Jabalpur for twenty years. The richest man in Jabalpur
used to come to me once in a while. He said one day ‘One thing troubles
me always: I have been helping all of my relatives, even faraway
relatives, I have made them all rich in every possible way, but nobody
feels friendly towards me. In fact, I feel a certain antagonism from all
of my relatives. Why is it so? I have done so much for them, and there
was no need for me to do anything for them. I did it out of love, but
they feel antagonistic.’</p><p><br></p><p>I said, ‘I know your relatives – they also visit me – and I know that
they are antagonistic to you. The reason is very simple: you have never
allowed them to do anything for you. You have always been doing things
for them and you have never allowed them to do even a small thing for
you – you have not even asked them to bring you a rose flower – so they
are all feeling humiliated. And it is not love that you are talking
about, it is just ego: “I have done so much!” You want to show them that
“I have done so much and I don’t need anybody to do anything for me”;
that’s why there is antagonism. Of course, you have done it with good
intentions, but intentions don’t count. The unconscious desire for ego
fulfilment, for ego gratification is hurting them.’</p><p><br></p><p>I said to him, ‘Once in a while give them a chance. I know that you
don’t need anything, but they have beautiful gardens and you can tell
them, “Sometimes bring roses for me.” Sometimes when you fall ill you
can ask them to come and just sit by your side, and they will all feel
happy. Just small things! Sometimes you can tell them, “Invite me to
supper, to dinner,” and they will be immensely overjoyed; they will not
feel antagonism.’</p><p><br></p><p>He said, ‘That I cannot do – that is impossible. That is against my
nature.’</p><p><br></p><p>So I told him, ‘Then it is absolutely clear now – even you can see it
– why all your good deeds have brought antagonism!’</p><p><br></p><p>These do-gooders are mischievous people. They do good, but their
desire is just the opposite of it.</p><p><br></p><p>Prem Joyce, the idea of feeling superior to the other is present in
both cases, whether you feel sorry or you have compassion.</p><p><br></p><p>And you say:... AND THAT IT DOES NOT NECESSARILY HAVE ANYTHING TO DO
WITH LOVE...</p><p><br></p><p>Certainly it does not necessarily have anything to do with love – not
only that, it is anti-love because it is an ego trip and ego can never
be in tune with love. Ego is poison to love, it is necessarily
anti-love. Your compassion is not out of love if some desire of being
superior is being fulfilled by it.</p><p><br></p><p>The lover never feels superior – the lover cannot feel superior, the
lover cannot even think that he has obliged anybody. On the contrary,
when somebody receives your love you feel obliged that your love was not
rejected – it could have been rejected – that your love was respected,
welcomed. You feel obliged, you feel thankful, you feel grateful.</p><p><br></p><p>And you say:... WHEREAS COMPASSION MUST BE AN INTEGRAL PART OF
LOVING.</p><p>No, compassion is higher than love. Love is an integral part of
compassion, but compassion is not an integral part of love. That’s the
difference between thinking and meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>These three things are to be taken note of: the lowest love is sex –
it is physical – and the highest refinement of love is compassion. Sex
is below love, compassion is above love – love is exactly in the
middle.</p><p><br></p><p>Very few people know what love is. Ninety-nine percent of people,
unfortunately, think sexuality is love – it is not. Sexuality is very
animal; it certainly has the potential of growing into love, but it is
not actual love, only a potential.</p><p><br></p><p>A seed is not a flower. It can become a flower, but there is no
certainty, no guarantee that it is going to become a flower – it may die
as a seed. If you put it on a rock it will not sprout into a bush, into
a flowering tree, it will die. If you throw it into fire it Will
die.</p><p><br></p><p>Sex has the potential of love, but only the potential, remember; it
is the seed. There is no need to deny it because if you throw away the
seed, if you deny the seed, then love disappears.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why in the so-called religious people you will not find love
and its warmth, you will find them cold, dead, without love Yes, they
will have compassion, they will feel sorry for you, because you are
hell-bound and they are going to heaven. Naturally they feel sorry for
you: ‘Poor souls!’ You will suffer hell-fire and they will be enjoying
the pleasures of heaven.</p><p><br></p><p>There is no love at all, but they have compassion. And having
compassion is a pseudo thing, it is not the true compassion. They have
denied sex, and in denying sex they have denied love.</p><p><br></p><p>Sex has to be used in the right perspective. It has not to be
repressed, it has not to be denied, and you are not to remain confined
to it either. No repression, no indulgence. The path is very subtle.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus says: The path is straight but very narrow. It is a razor’s
edge.</p><p><br></p><p>Sex either becomes indulgence, as it has become in the West, or it
becomes repressed, as it has become in the East. On one side there is a
well, on the other side there is a ditch, and you can fall in. You have
to walk between the two. Certainly it is a razor’s edge, tight-rope
walking; you have to remain very balanced.</p><p><br></p><p>And the functioning of the mind is such that it moves from one pole
to the other. It is exactly like the pendulum of an old clock: it goes
from right to left, the extreme left, and from the extreme left again to
the extreme right.</p><p><br></p><p>And remember the law: as you see the pendulum moving towards the left
it is gaining momentum to go to the right; while it is actually going
towards the right it is gaining momentum to go to the left. So don’t be
deceived by what you see; something inside is growing which is just the
opposite of what you are seeing.</p><p><br></p><p>The repressed person is always ready to go into indulgence. All the
repressed societies are boiling, ready to go into indulgence, and they
find ways and means to go into indulgence.</p><p>For example, this country has repressed sex for thousands of years,
and the natural outcome has been a backdoor indulgence. In Indian
temples prostitutes have existed. In the South still, even today in the
twentieth century, temples have prostitutes. They are not called
prostitutes – Indians are very clever at giving beautiful names to ugly
things – they are called DEVADASIS, ‘servants of God’. And who are these
gods? First the priest who initiates them into sexual indulgence and
then the rich clients who come to the temple. These are the gods whom
they serve! But they are supposed to serve the stone statue of the god
inside the temple. That is just a facade. In India prostitution can now
exist only in a religious garb – sex has been such a taboo that you have
to find some way to make it religious.</p><p><br></p><p>Temples like Khajuraho, Konarak, Puri have not existed anywhere in
the West. There is no need people are already indulging – they are
indulging by the front door – so there is no need to go by the back
door.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not a coincidence that the first treatise on sex was written in
India. What Sigmund Freud, Wilhelm Reich Masters and Johnson, and other
sex researchers have done is nothing compared to Vatsayana’s sutras, the
KAMA SUTRA – sex sutras – and they are three thousand years old.</p><p><br></p><p>After the birth of every great religion in India, Tantra entered by
the back door. Nothing but sexuality in a rationalized form –
ninety-nine percent of it is sexuality. There is Buddhist Tantra. Buddha
could not have conceived of it, that his followers were going to make
sex a religious ritual. But what can people do? If you repress them too
much then they have to find ways, otherwise they will be continuously
burning with desire.</p><p><br></p><p>Hindu Tantra... very ugly. If you just look at the Tantra paintings
you will be surprised. These are the people who say that I am destroying
their culture! And what kind of culture do they have? – Khajuraho and
Tantra treatises and Vatsayana’s KAMA SUTRA and Pundit Koka’s KOKA
SHASTRA. What culture do they have?</p><p><br></p><p>All this nonsense has happened because sex was repressed. In the West
sex became indulgence. Both are wrong. But that’s how the mind is: it
always goes from the frying pan to the fire! It cannot stay in the
middle, because to stay in the middle is the death of the mind.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what I call meditation: if you can stay exactly in the middle,
the clock stops. If the pendulum stays in the middle, if you hold the
pendulum in the middle, the clock stops. And if you hold yourself
exactly in the middle, if you avoid the extreme and hold to the axis,
suddenly you will see that the mind has stopped. Mind functions almost
like a clock.</p><p><br></p><p>Sex is a potential, a great potential. If you become aware and alert,
meditative, then sex can be transformed into love. And if your
meditativeness becomes total, absolute, love can be transformed into
compassion.</p><p><br></p><p>Sex is the seed, love is the flower, compassion is the fragrance.</p><p><br></p><p>Compassion has love as one of its ingredients, but not vice versa –
love is not compassionate. You can see it everywhere: lovers are
continuously fighting. They are intimate enemies, continuously at each
other’s throats. Yes, once in a while, just to rest, they are loving
too, but those love-breaks are</p><p>few and far between; otherwise there is constant struggle, fight. The
woman is nagging – that is her way of fighting – and the man is always
ready to hit hard on the woman’s head. In fact, people think that when
you don’t fight, your love has died.</p><p><br></p><p>Psychologists also agree with these fools. They say that it you don’t
fight that means you are not interested, if you don’t fight that simply
means it does not matter; if it matters then you have to fight. Lovers
are fighting – there is no compassion there is cruelty. And you can see
that cruelty in their love-making also.</p><p><br></p><p>For thousands of years people have been making love in the dark for
the simple reason that it looks ridiculous, aggressive. Lovers are not
related in a compassionate way, it is a fight to grab as much as
possible: to give as little as possible and to get as much as possible.
It is a bargain, it is a business. People art forcing each other to give
love in every possible way, direct and indirect. It is cruelty, it is
violence, it is aggression.</p><p><br></p><p>Once in a while it has happened that lovers have killed each other.
That seems to be the extreme form of love, just the very climax! They
bite, they scratch with their nails. Vatsayana says these are methods of
love – scratching the beloved with your nails and biting your beloved so
that blood comes! These are ‘love methods’, ‘love techniques’! Vatsayana
must have been some kind of sadist, but Indians call him a rishi, a seer
– a maharishi, a great seer. He must have been like Maharishi Mahesh
Yogi – a great seer! And all this nonsense he is writing, giving
techniques... It is called ‘love-bite’, ‘love-scratch’. And he says it
makes love-making very deep, profound.</p><p><br></p><p>You must have heard about de Sade from whose name ‘sadism’ has been
coined. De Sade seems to have been the greatest lover in the world! He
used to carry a suitcase with him, just like a doctor’s suitcase, with
all the instruments. Of course he was far more modern than Vatsayana.
Why scratch with your nails if you can have beautiful instruments to
scratch with? Why bite with your teeth if you can have devices? And as a
Western man, technology-oriented, he had all kinds of instruments in his
bag.</p><p><br></p><p>He had a beautiful personality – women became attracted to him – he
was very rich, he was a marquis. But once a woman entered his love
chamber – it was called a ‘love chamber’ in fact it should be called
‘torture chamber’ – he would immediately lock the door. The woman would
be puzzled because on all the walls there were other, bigger instruments
– whips and all kinds of things. And then he would undress the woman and
start beating her.</p><p><br></p><p>The women who had been in love with him – of course they never dared
to go again, once was enough – even confessed before the court... Almost
all the women, because he had made love to many women, hundreds – he was
rich enough to pay – confessed in court that the way he made love to
them was always dangerous and they were very scared, but they never had
such beautiful orgasms either before or after.</p><p><br></p><p>And de Sade writes in his memoirs that when you beat a woman she
becomes really aroused, when you whip her she becomes alive, warm.
Certainly, obviously!</p><p><br></p><p>Lovers don’t have compassion for each other. You may not be a de
Sade, but every lover is on the way to it. De Sade may be the goal, but
very few reach to that height.</p><p>Prem Joyce, love has no ingredient of compassion in it. Vice versa is
true – compassion certainly has love in it – but because of compassion
that love has a totally different quality, a different flavour.</p><p><br></p><p>The word ‘compassion’ has to be understood: when passion is
transformed it is called compassion, when passion goes through an
absolute transformation it is compassion. Love is a stage on the way but
not the end.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha has defined compassion as ‘love plus meditation’. When your
love is not just a desire for the other, when your love is not only a
need, when your love is a sharing, when your love is not that of a
beggar but that of an emperor, when your love is not asking for
something in return but is ready only to give – to give for the sheer
joy of giving – then add meditation to it and the pure fragrance is
released, the imprisoned splendour is released. That is compassion;
compassion is the highest phenomenon.</p><p><br></p><p>Sex is animal, love is human, compassion is divine. Sex is physical,
love is psychological, compassion is spiritual.</p><p><br></p><p>And let me remind you again that it is not ‘having compassion’, it is
being compassion. You can have sex, you can ‘have’ love – though you
‘have’ it less than sex – but you cannot have compassion. You become
compassion, your very being is compassion. Walking, you are
compassionate, sitting, you are compassionate, sleeping, you are
compassionate. Whether anybody is there or not does not matter: your
compassion is just like a flame – it goes on burning in absolute
aloneness, radiating. If somebody passes by he can have it, with no
strings attached, with no conditions. Compassion is the experience of
the Buddhas, of the awakened.</p><p><br></p><p>You cannot reflect on these matters. Stop reflecting, don’t waste
your energy in reflecting. Put the whole energy into meditation. Become
silent, aware, watchful, and in that watchfulness miracles happen. And
everybody is entitled to this miracle of becoming compassion. It is our
birthright!</p><p><br></p><p>The second question Question 2</p><p>OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>THE OTHER DAY YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT HUGGING AND KISSING AS AN
EXPRESSION OF FREEDOM. AFTER DISCOURSE AN INDIAN SANNYASIN WAS SWAYING
AND HUGGING A WESTERN WOMAN SANNYASIN AND IT LOOKED SO UGLY TO SEE. IT
DID NOT FEEL AT ALL LIKE LOVE. IT SEEMED THAT HE WAS TRYING TO UTILIZE
THE WORD ‘FREEDOM’ AS A RESULT OF YOUR DISCOURSE.</p><p><br></p><p>Yoga Vidya,</p><p><br></p><p>The Indian mind is in a very perverted state. Here, my Indian
sannyasins comprise three categories. The first, the best, have come
here for spiritual growth, they have come to inquire about truth, about
meditation, about freedom, about God. The second kind are very
repressed. They have not come to inquire about freedom, truth,
liberation, meditation; they are boiling with repression – which is
the</p><p>normal state of the Indian society outside. They have come here just
to use this freedom that I am giving to my people. Of course their love
will look ugly because it is not love, it is simply perverted sex – it
is sex standing on its head. And the third category consists only of
curious people who have not come because of any reason, just to see what
is happening. They come and go; they are not the problem.</p><p><br></p><p>But the problem is that they come and only see the second type of
Indian – hugging and kissing in an ugly way – and they spread rumours
all over the country about what is happening here. They don’t see the
best Indians who are really in tune with me.</p><p><br></p><p>Ninety percent of my sannyasins – Indian sannyasins, I mean – belong
to the first category, the best people. Nine percent belong to the
second category: the ugly people, the fools. They have not come here for
me. Some have come because there are so many beautiful women around,
some have come to cheat, to borrow money, to steal. We are trying to
throw them out, but still a few somehow manage to get in. They even
meditate to show that they are meditators, but their real motives are
totally different.</p><p><br></p><p>So, Vidya, whenever you find that any Indian sannyasin is misusing
the freedom available here, throw him out immediately and ban him!</p><p><br></p><p>When two Westerners are hugging each other there is a beauty in it,
because they are not coming from a repressed society. They have not come
here just to hug! They could have hugged far better in the West; there
was no need to come thousands of miles to this dirty place, Poona, to be
sick with hepatitis and amoebas and dengue fever and suffer all kinds of
troubles – to be raped by Indians, to be killed by people, to be
murdered, beaten. They have not come here just to hug and kiss – that is
beautifully available in the West – they have come here to seek and
search for something which is not available there. So when they are
hugging each other there is no sex involved in it; it is just a
sharing.</p><p><br></p><p>But the Indian stupids who are here – that nine percent – are only
here to hug and kiss. Poor fellows! They even have to meditate, they
have to do vipassana, they go through all kinds of tortures... because
these are tortures for them! But they suffer all these tortures.</p><p><br></p><p>And this is my experience: that the Western people are far more
innocent – naturally, because they come from a richer society, an
affluent, free society without any taboos. They are innocent, childlike,
and they easily become involved with these cunning people, these cunning
Indians.</p><p><br></p><p>I want my Western sannyasins also to be a little watchful and aware.
Avoid these ugly people! These people are not the right people to
commune with. And to all the guards and to the office I would like to
say that whenever you find some ugly thing happening here, immediately
throw the person out.</p><p><br></p><p>The freedom is for beauty – for anything beautiful there is freedom,
but not for ugly things to happen. They should not be allowed, at least
not in my commune. My commune has to live up to the highest standards of
beauty, love, compassion, meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>But because we are in India and once in a while somebody is bound to
get in, be a little alert and careful. Immediately stop such people from
entering the ashram – I don’t want to have anything to</p><p>do with such people. And freedom certainly can be misused too. Only
freedom can be misused; if there is no freedom, then there is no
question of any misuse.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why societies have not allowed freedom, they have made a very
strict discipline for people, they have made a very repressed structure
around people for the simple reason that freedom is dangerous; it can be
misused. Slavery cannot be misused – what can the slave do?</p><p><br></p><p>Indians live in absolute slavery outside this ashram, and when they
come in of course they are coming with all kinds of scorpions and snakes
and dogs within them and they start freeing all kinds of repressed,
perverted desires, because they have never seen such freedom.</p><p><br></p><p>Freedom can be used only by people who are very aware. Repressed
people cannot use it; they are bound to misuse it.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard many other stories about this Indian, whosoever he is.
If he has any sense he should immediately stop doing such acts, or if he
cannot then this is not the place for him. He should leave, otherwise he
will be thrown out. I know the name of the person, but I will not say
the name here – he will understand. So, whosoever it may concern...</p><p><br></p><p>The last question Question 3 OSHO,</p><p>WHAT SHOULD BE DONE SO THAT PEOPLE CAN UNDERSTAND YOU? I FEEL VERY
SAD TO SEE SO MUCH MISUNDERSTANDING ABOUT YOU AND YOUR TEACHINGS.</p><p><br></p><p>Ananto,</p><p><br></p><p>In a way it is natural. It is not unusual, it is to be expected that
people will misunderstand me. They have always misunderstood the truth,
the naked truth. And they are very slow, so they always get the joke
very late.</p><p><br></p><p>They started understanding Buddha when he was dead, they started
understanding Socrates when they themselves had killed him, they started
having respect for Jesus when they had crucified him – they themselves!
Now they remember with great respect the names of Al-Hillaj Mansur and
Sarmad, whom they themselves destroyed.</p><p><br></p><p>People are very slow to understand.</p><p><br></p><p>Recently a letter of Gauguin’s sold for over five thousand
dollars.</p><p><br></p><p>In it the painter complained of his poverty, that he was starving to
death.</p><p><br></p><p>Now the letter is sold for five thousand dollars, and in the letter
the painter is complaining that he is starving – starving to death!
People are strange! They take such a long time to understand.</p><p>Vincent van Gogh’s paintings are worshipped now all over the world.
Now they say that he was one of the greatest painters ever, but while he
was alive not a single painting was sold. Now each painting is valued
nearabout one million dollars, and only two hundred paintings are in
existence. If he was alive now he would have been the richest man, but
he was so poor while he was alive that he would only eat three days a
week.</p><p><br></p><p>He used to get enough money from his brother to eat the cheapest food
for the whole week, but he had to save some money for canvases and
paints and colours and brushes, so he had to starve for four days to
save a little money.</p><p><br></p><p>He committed suicide when he was only thirty-three, just because it
was so difficult to survive. Nobody would accept his paintings; there
was no question of anybody purchasing them. People even refused to
accept his paintings for hanging in their houses. He would present his
paintings free to people and they threw them in the basement or
somewhere else.</p><p><br></p><p>His brother, thinking that he was feeling so sad because he had not
sold a single painting in his life, sent one man with some money to go
and purchase one painting.</p><p><br></p><p>The man went. Van Gogh could not believe his ears that there should
be one man in the whole world who was ready to purchase his paintings,
so he showed them with great interest. But the man was not interested in
the paintings at all. He said, ‘Any painting will do. You keep this
money and give me the painting.’</p><p><br></p><p>Immediately he understood what the matter was. He said, ‘Forget about
purchasing the painting! It seems my brother has sent you, so take this
money back. It is better to die without selling a painting!’</p><p><br></p><p>And the same day he committed suicide – it was enough. He painted
nearabout one thousand paintings; eight hundred paintings have been lost
because people never cared about them. When his paintings started
becoming famous after his death, people started searching for his
paintings. They were found in all kinds of places – people’s basements,
bathrooms. And they were easily purchased; people were very willing to
give them away for a little money or even for no money. Now each single
painting is valued at one million dollars.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s how people have always functioned, so there is nothing
unnatural about it. People have their own understanding...</p><p><br></p><p>Two kids were talking. ‘What are you going to ask Santa Claus to give
you for Christmas?’ ‘I want an astronaut’s suit. And you?’</p><p>‘I want a tampon.’</p><p><br></p><p>‘A tampon? What’s that?’</p><p><br></p><p>‘I don’t know, but on the TV they say that with it you can travel
everywhere, swim, play...’</p><p><br></p><p>Now, small children are small children – they have their
understanding! Now this ‘tampon’ is something magical: you can travel
anywhere, everywhere, swim, play – do whatsoever you want.</p><p>The apples on a farmer’s tree had just ripened. The owner put a
notice under the tree which said, ‘Don’t steal! God is watching
you!’</p><p><br></p><p>The day after, the farmer found his apple tree had been picked bare.
On the notice the thief had added a few more words: ‘But he is not a
spy!’</p><p><br></p><p>Two members of the Town Council began shouting at each other. ‘You
are the biggest idiot in the world!’ the first shouted.</p><p>‘And you are the most bigoted and prejudiced donkey in town!’ the
other man yelled.</p><p><br></p><p>The mayor, who was presiding, banged his gavel and said, ‘Quiet,
gentlemen, quiet please. I’m afraid that in your excitement you have
forgotten that I am in the room too!’</p><p><br></p><p>The psychiatrist was talking to his patient. ‘Well,’ he said, ‘your
problem has sexual origins. I have to ask you something about your
sexual behaviour. Do you talk to your husband while making love?’</p><p><br></p><p>‘Well... yes,’ answered the woman. ‘I mean, only if there happens to
be a telephone nearby!’</p><p><br></p><p>A man called on his lawyer and said, ‘I want to sue that man who
lives across the street from me. He called me a hippopotamus!’</p><p><br></p><p>‘We can do that,’ the lawyer said. ‘When did he call you that?’ ‘Six
years ago,’ the man replied.</p><p>‘Six years ago!’ the lawyer exclaimed. ‘Why have you waited so long
to file suit against him?’</p><p><br></p><p>‘Well,’ the man said, ‘yesterday I took the kids to the zoo and it
was the first time I had ever seen a hippopotamus!’</p><p><br></p><p>Ananto, you ask me: WHAT SHOULD BE DONE SO THAT PEOPLE CAN UNDERSTAND
YOU?</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, nothing can be done. If you understand me, live that
understanding, that’s all. If somebody is ready to understand it, good.
If nobody is ready to understand it, that is nothing to bother about,
that is their business. Don’t become too concerned about others because
that concern will disturb your own growth. Grow according to your inner
light, and if you are full of light maybe some people will start
understanding.</p><p><br></p><p>If my sannyasins start living exactly what I mean, then that’s
enough. A few people will certainly understand you, and only a few are
capable of understanding it; the larger mob is incapable of
understanding anything that goes beyond them. But that is their freedom.
If they don’t want to understand, it has not to be forced upon them.</p><p><br></p><p>A drunk was weaving around the bar of an exclusive hotel. He asked
the barman the way to the men’s toilet and he was told that it was the
first door on the right down the hall. So he blundered through the first
door on the left and fell into the swimming pool.</p><p>He had been treading water for well over five minutes when the door
opened. ‘For God’s sake!’ he screamed. ‘Don’t flush it yet!’</p><p>And the really last question Question 4</p><p>OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>DO YOU TAKE YOURSELF SERIOUSLY?</p><p><br></p><p>Rishiraj,</p><p><br></p><p>Never! Seriousness and I have nothing in common; there is no bridge
between me and seriousness. Did you hear the latest joke, Rishiraj?</p><p>Osho goes to the psychiatrist. Says the psychiatrist, ‘This is the
first time you have come to me, so please tell me your story from the
very beginning.’</p><p><br></p><p>Replies Osho, ‘In the beginning, I created the sky and the
earth...’</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part2>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

‌CHAPTER 1
Zen: The Koan of Life
27 December 1980 am in Buddha Hall
The first question Question 1 OSHO,
DO YOU REALLY THINK ZEN IS FULL OF ZEST, ZIP, ZAP AND ZING?
Samadhi,
Zen is not a religion, it is living life in its totality, herenow. Religions are always postponing life: they are giving you beautiful illusions about life somewhere in the future, far away, beyond death.</description>

‌CHAPTER 10
Here and Now: The Only Time, The Only Place
5 January 1981 am in Buddha Hall
The first question Question 1 OSHO,
CAN YOU THROW SOME LIGHT ON THE FEELING OF NOSTALGIA? FREUD CALLED IT REGRESSIVE AND A SEEKING OF THE WOMB. THIS DOES NOT SATISFY ME.
SOMETIMES THE PERFUME OF A FLOWER, SOUNDS, A PLACE OR AN INCIDENT FROM CHILDHOOD, CAN EVOKE A FEW SECONDS OF FEELING AND YEARNING THAT ARE SO SAD AND SO SWEET, IT CAN CHOKE ME WITH ITS INTENSITY.</description>

‌CHAPTER 11
Man: The Call of the Eternal
6 January 1981 am in Buddha Hall
The first question Question 1 OSHO,
WHAT IS IT TO BE A MAN?
Prem Agama,
It is one of the most difficult questions to ask – difficult because it cannot be answered. It cannot be answered because it is not really a question but a quest. Questions are simple, they can be easily answered, but a quest is a challenge, it is an adventure.</description>

‌CHAPTER 12
Life: Let it have it’s Dance
7 January 1981 am in Buddha Hall
The first question Question 1 OSHO,
FOR MOST OF MY LIFE I HAVE HELD MYSELF ALOOF, SEPARATE AND ISOLATED, AND I HAVE THEREFORE BEEN PROTECTED FROM PEOPLE AND SITUATIONS.
MY INNERMOST FEAR HAS ALWAYS BEEN THAT IF I OPENED MY HEART TOTALLY THE VAST LOVE THAT I FEEL WOULD RUSH OUT LIKE WATER FROM AN OVERFLOWING WELL AND BE LOST, DIVERTED OR REJECTED.</description>

Godliness: An Experience of Immense Joy
8 January 1981 am in Buddha Hall
The first question Question 1 OSHO,
WHY DO I WANT PEOPLE TO ADMIRE ME? WHY DO I WANT YOU TO TELL ME THAT ONLY VERY SENSITIVE AND INTELLIGENT PEOPLE CAN ASK SUCH A QUESTION? WHY DO I WANT YOU TO TELL ME THAT YOU WERE ONLY WAITING FOR ME TO SAVE THE WORLD?</description>

9 January 1981 am in Buddha Hall
The first question Question 1 OSHO,

D. M. Silvera,

‌CHAPTER 15
The Philousia
10 January 1981 am in Buddha Hall
The first question Question 1 OSHO,
IS THERE ANYTHING YOU CAN SAY ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING TO VIMALKIRTI?
Arup,
Nothing is happening to Vimalkirti – exactly nothing, because nothing is nirvana. The West has no idea of the beauty of nothingness. The whole Western attitude is extrovert, oriented towards things, oriented towards actions. ‘Nothing’ sound like emptiness – it is not so.</description>

‌CHAPTER 2
Innocence: Lost and Found Again
28 December 1980 am in Buddha Hall
The first question Question 1 OSHO,
DO YOU THINK THAT YOU WILL GO TO HEAVEN WHEN YOU DIE?
Prem Pramod,
There is no heaven anywhere, it is here. It is always here, it is never there. It is always now, it is never then. The very idea of heaven somewhere else – there, then – is a strategy of the mind to deceive you, to keep you ignorant of the heaven that surrounds you every moment.</description>

‌CHAPTER 3
Sex, Love and Compassion: Seed, Flower and Fragrance
29 December 1980 am in Buddha Hall
Question 1 OSHO,
I HAVE BEEN REFLECTING ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ‘FEELING SORRY’ FOR SOMEONE AND ‘HAVING COMPASSION’. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT TO BE SORRY FOR SOMEONE HAS AN ELEMENT OF CONDESCENSION IN IT, AS IF YOU WERE SUPERIOR TO THE OTHER, AND THAT IT DOES NOT NECESSARILY HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH LOVE, WHEREAS COMPASSION MUST BE AN INTEGRAL PART OF LOVING.</description>

30 December 1980 am in Buddha Hall
Question 1 OSHO,
MY UNCLE, PANDIT SATYAVRATA SIDDHANTALANKAR, WHO IS EIGHTY-TWO YEARS OLD, IS A GREAT ADMIRER OF YOURS.

THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TEACHINGS. I AM VERY GRATEFUL. I CAME HERE VERY HUNGRY AND YOU ARE FEEDING ME.
MY QUESTION IS: I HAVE BEEN RAISED TO BELIEVE THAT COMMITMENT IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY IF A RELATIONSHIP IS TO WORK.</description>

‌CHAPTER 6
Bhagwan: Perfectly at Ease, Totally at Home
1 January 1981 am in Buddha Hall
The first question Question 1 OSHO,
WHY DO PEOPLE CRITICIZE YOU AS A SELF-STYLED AND SELF-APPOINTED GOD?
Chaitanya Keerti,
There are many things to be understood. It is one of the ancientmost reactions of people, it is not anything new. It happened with Krishna, with Moses, with Christ, with Mahavira, with Buddha, with Mohammed, with Al-Hillaj Mansur.</description>

YOU ARE SHOWERING IMMENSE LOVE ON YOUR DISCIPLES AND OTHERS. BUT WHY AREN’T OTHER ENLIGHTENED BEINGS LIKE YOU, SO FULL OF LOVE AND COMPASSION? IS IT NOT TRUE THAT LOVE AND COMPASSION DAWN WITH ENLIGHTENMENT?
WHY DO OTHER MASTERS SEEM TO BE SO DRY AND MERE INTELLECTUALS IN COMPARISON WITH YOU?</description>

‌CHAPTER 8
Women: Free of All the Chains
3 January 1981 am in Buddha Hall
The first question Question 1 OSHO,
HOW CAN INDIA BE FREE WHEN HER WOMEN ARE NOT?
R. K. Karanjia,
India is suffering from a very ugly and rotten past, and the problem is that Indians go on praising their past as golden. The whole world, except India, believes in evolution; India believes in INvolution.</description>

4 January 1981 am in Buddha Hall
The first question Question 1 OSHO,
WHY IS INDIA DRIFTING TOWARDS LAWLESSNESS? ARE INDIANS THE MOST LAWLESS PEOPLE?
Ayub Syed,
The Indian mind is programmed to be that of a slave; it is not ready to function in freedom. That’s where the roots of the problems are.</description>

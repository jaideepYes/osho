And that’s the beauty of life – that there is always surprise and there is always the unexpected... and because the unexpected happens there is joy, excitement, ecstasy. Whenever only the expected starts happening, joy dies. Then one just leads a dried, dead, fossil-like life. The more of the unexpected there is, the more one lives. Life is the unexpected and with the unexpected, so always remain available to the unexpected – that very availability makes one alive. There are very few people in the world who are really alive – most are just alive corpses. They look alive, appear to be alive, but the unexpected has stopped happening. Now, that is ugly: they know they will be repeating their yesterday, they know what they will be doing even in their next life. If they have to live for eternity they will go on just like a wheel moving again and again and again – just a broken gramophone record which goes on repeating the same line.\nThe unexpected is the ecstatic moment, the unexpected is what god is, so remain available to the unexpected I And the more available you are, the more it will be coming – because it comes many times but we are closed.\nNow, it was not a necessity that you should become a sannyasin; you had just come to meet your friend. You could have remained closed, but you opened up. A new beginning starts, something new has entered in your life – now you will not be the same ever!\nAnd this simple step of being a sannyasin will have tremendous impact. It will open more doors – and life is a thrill when you know that something unexpected is still possible.\n[A new sannyasin said she would like to learn T’ai Chi.]\nT’ai chi is very good, mm? But when the body is unburdened of repressed emotions and energy starts flowing, then T’ai Chi is just the right thing to do. But just wait... Just wait a little, mm? Always remember, everything has a particular time, a particular season and a particular climate. First create the season and the climate. Let there be spring, then flowers come very easily. Otherwise sometimes in the wrong season, in the wrong climate, you can go on working hard and nothing will happen. My experience with T’ai Chi is that if a person has many repressed emotions, those emotions become like a wall around the diaphragm. He cannot feel the hara, the T’ai Chi centre. Even if you tell him that it is there, just below the navel, two inches below the navel, he cannot feel it. He can believe it, he can imagine it, but he cannot feel it – and unless you feel it exactly where it is, t’ai chi doesn’t start. You have to be focused there, centred there – there is the source of your ‘chi’, your energy.\nBut unless one has thrown all the repressed emotionsAnger, greed, jealousy, and a thousand\nand one things are there and we go on piling them up in the stomach because that is the only empty space in the body. So whatsoever you want to throw, you throw it there – either throw it out or throw it in; only two are the ways.\nCatharsis means throwing it out so it doesn’t spoil your system. If a person is in a situation where he wants to scream and he does not – maybe there are so many people and it will look odd; they will think him bizarre, mad, crazy and he himself thinks that it is crazy – where will he throw it? Where will the scream go? He will push it down inside the stomach, he will sit upon it. Now the scream will be pressed like a spring: you can sit upon a spring, but the spring is there and any moment that you go away the spring will uncoil. You go on repressing millions of things every day in this way – the stomach is too much burdened – then suddenly you start T’ai Chi. You cannot feel where your ‘chi’ centre is. You have lost all contact, because between you and the ‘chi’ centre there is such rubbish, a mountain of rubbish. That mountain has to be removed first. Once it is removed – once your ‘chi’ centre starts functioning well and you can see it directly; you can relate to it not in imagination but actually, you can start feeling your life energy bubbling there – then things become very simple and T’ai Chi comes very very easily.\nSo just finish a few groups and then I will suggest you do T’ai Chi, but go on asking me so I remember, mm?\n[Osho suggests to a sannyasin, who is leaving for the West, it will be good to start a centre in his home. People are in such deep need – they only need to be made aware of something like meditation and they will come running. Osho encourages sannyasins who are returning to the west to be involved in the running of meditation centres, because the work helps them to stay in contact with him, apart from helping to introduce others to Osho and to meditation. As buddha stressed the importance of one growing in compassion and meditation simultaneously, Osho too says it is important to share whatever one attains with others. Otherwise one tends to become too self- centred and unconcerned about the welfare of others. And in sharing, one receives more: the more one gives, the more one receives.]\n[A visitor says: I wish to ask whether this is sensible – whether external science can lead towards internal yoga, and whether my feeling that this may eventually provide the way for the race as a whole to be transformed, is real.]\nMm mm... it is complicated! Firstly, it is as if to come to this place where you are sitting, you start\nmoving away from this spot. Yes, one day you will come back if you go on moving away, away, away – the earth is round, one day you will come back to this place – but this is an unnecessary journey. To come to the internal by going to the external, yes, one day you will come. Mathematically it is not wrong – you will come – because all energies move in a circle. If you go to the very furthest end of externality, there will be a turn of the energy and you will start coming back – but why? For that which was so easily available, why go that far?\nI have heard about a man who was driving fast, somewhere near New Delhi. He asked a villager – because he was feeling a little lost – ‘If I go in this direction will I ever reach Delhi?’ The villager said, ‘You will reach but you will have to go around the whole earth because you have left Delhi behind by eight miles! But if you turn back, Delhi is very close by.’ Logically it is right – I will not say it is wrong. If you really go it will take many lives; this life won’t be enough, this life is very short. You cannot go to the very end of the external – it is an infinity; to exhaust it will be almost impossible. But if you exhaust it, then there is a turn. Space is curved: if you go on, go on, go on, then one day you start coming home. Everything moves in a circle so you are bound to come home, but I don’t see that there is any need in the first place. If you are enjoying it, it is perfectly good – go that way, mm? I never want to distract anybody from anything. I don’t even distract a person who is going to commit a sin, because if he goes into it he will become a saint. Where can he go in the sin? One day he will start moving towards sainthood. In fact the best way to become a great saint is to become a great sinner. This is doing something, which could have been done very easily, in the hard way, but there are people who like the hard way. . .then it is perfectly good.\nThe second thing: when you start thinking of the whole world, you are avoiding something about yourself. Yes, if you go on working on external thingsOne day science may start becoming more\nreligious – it has already started – and it will be a great boon to humanity; but when? It will take centuries, but meanwhile what happens to you? – one thing. The second thing: if the people who are working in science don’t have some interiority, then science will take even longer to become religion. Just think: if einstein, max plank, eddington, people like them – if they were great meditators then that utopia would have already happened. By the end of his life, eddington started feeling that he had missed something. Just at the end he started feeling that the world was not like a thing, it is like a thought – but just at the end. Just at the end he started feeling that whatsoever he had thought about this world was not right... and so was the case with Albert Einstein. Just in the last days he started feeling that the mystery was not destroyed – rather, it had become even deeper than before.\nIf one works in the scientific world, one day one will start feeling it... but this will be a feeling. It remained a feeling with Einstein – he died a non-meditator.\nMy suggestion is – just a humble suggestion because I don’t say to do it – my suggestion is: go on working on whatsoever external things you want to but side by side go on working on the internal too. Let there be a balance so that if you can contribute something, good; if nothing is contributed, you don’t miss it! And if you become silent, if you become aware, humanity becomes aware through you – because who are you, who am I? We are not separate!\nA single individual becoming silent, blissful, is a part of humanity becoming silent, blissful, happy. Something in humanity has happened through him. Humanity will never be the same again because this man meditated.\nIt has never been the same since Buddha or since Christ; and they were not working on anything\nexternal: they were working on their internal, their innermost core. But since Buddha arrived home, became enlightened, humanity has never been the same – cannot be – because Buddha is absorbed by existence. Through him we have all evolved. If even a single drop of the ocean becomes enlightened, the ocean has become enlightened in part and that enlightenment spreads all over the ocean. The total energy goes higher, new visions arise in humanity, new songs are born.\nSo my suggestion is that it is good, working on the external is perfectly right, enjoy it, but let it be your hobby, not your work – work should be internal. It is good to keep both, and there is no contradiction in them, no, not at all – the inner and the outer fit together, they are aspects of one phenomenon. They are not opposite; they are complementaries.\nSo a man can work in the lab and forget about himself utterly, and then can come home and forget the lab utterly and go into himself and meditate, and this man will have the right balance.\nAnd the more capable you become of meditation, the deeper will be your thrust into the external, and the deeper your thrust into the external, the deeper will be your capacity to move in – because it is you: if you can move out, why cannot you move in ? If you can move in, why cannot you move out – it is you! Out and in don’t matter; that is only a question of direction. If you can rush away from me, why cannot you rush towards me? You are the same man – just the direction changes.\nVery good – go on working, but start going into meditation also. Come back if you can some time and stay a little longer, mm? Good.\n[The hypnotherapy group is present. The leader asked about the difference between letting things happen, following his feelings, and doing what he feels he ought to. It was not a big problem but he wanted to look at it now.]\nMm mm. It is not something big but it can grow into something big, so your feeling is right. It is just a small seed but it can grow, it can become very big. It is better to understand it while it is just in seed; then it can easily be changed, dropped, transformed – a thousand and one things are possible. Once it becomes very big, it becomes more and more difficult, it becomes more complicated.\nThe first thing that you may not have looked into: you are still working on your own. Let me work! That’s where the crux of the problem is – and if you are working on your own you will get into many troubles. First, you will get tired, bored, because you will be doing the same thing again and again. If you are working on your own how can you avoid the fact that it is the same thing ? One gets fed up – it is natural; one gets tired, bored. When something is new one is excited. Doing the same group again and again, going through the same problems with the same type of people, it becomes tiring. Then you lose your feeling for it, you have to do it mechanically: when you start doing it mechanically of course you feel it is like prostitution .\nThat is the problem each groupleader has to face. But those who have dropped working on their own do not have to face it; they don’t carry a psychological memory of it. In fact, rather than doing the group you are just allowing me to do it. That will bring a great change. You are not burdened – if it succeeds you don’t succeed, if it fails you don’t fail; if everything goes well it’s good, if nothing goes well that too is good.\nThen you are simply absent in a way, you don’t collect a psychological memory, and then each time you will not feel the group as a repetition because you don’t collect it as your own. And once this happens your creativity will be released.\nThe ego is very non-creative. Ordinarily people think that unless you are egoistic, how can you be creative?\nThe ordinary understanding – which is a misunderstanding – is that the ego is creative. The ego is hot creative; at the most it can be constructive, not creative. At the most it can create some innovations, but those are not discoveries. All discoveries are made in a non-ego state.\nInnovation is one thing – it is just like redecorating the room: the room is the same, the furniture is the same, the pictures are the same, the paintings are the same. You are simply redecorating; white-washing, changing a colour here and there, just putting things in a new arrangement. It is constructive, not creative: it is just the old rearranged, readjusted.\nCreativity is something utterly new, discontinuous with your past. The ego is continuity with the past, hence it can never be creative. The ego has to give way. And when I say to let me work, it is just a simple device – not that I am going to work... I am not that foolish! (laughter) If I am unburdening you, don’t think that I will burden myself! (chuckling) Not at all! It is just a device: you love me and it will be easy for you to drop the ego in my name. Just in dropping it, something bigger than you starts functioning. Then the ego is no more in the way, you are simply available to the group. There will be much creativity, many new things will start happening – many new experiences that you had not expected ever will suddenly be there, many spontaneous happenings – and then there will be thrill, excitement, ecstasy and you will be flowing again .\nSo the first thing is to drop the idea that you are doing the group, and whenever this idea comes, just take hold of the locket in your hand and repeat loudly, ‘Osho, Osho, Osho...’ Let them laugh! Mm? drop the ego immediately – their laughter will also help. They will say, ’So, [the group leader] is also like us – nothing to be worried about! He is also in the same boat. They will feel very happy. The first thing.…\nAnd the second thing: there is a very delicate difference between acceptance and inefficiency. Many people start thinking that their inefficiency is acceptance; it is not. They are being tricky and they are deceiving themselves.\nAcceptance makes you more capable, acceptance helps you grow. Acceptance makes you more intelligent; it does not dull you. With acceptance you are not stuck. Acceptance does not mean that you have accepted your failure, no. Acceptance does not mean that you have accepted your limitations, that you don’t care, that you don’t bother, that it is okay; acceptance does not mean that it is okay.\nNow, these are two things: something is happening which you can accept out of inefficiency because you know you cannot do anything more about it. You feel the limitation, you are at the end of your rope and you know it. Rather than saying that you are at the end of your rope, it is better to say that you live in acceptance so whatsoever happens is good. This is camouflage, a rationalisation. If this happens again and again, you will lose all creativity, you will lose that blissful tension that\ncreates creativity. This is something to be understood: these so-called meditators – for example tm meditators – think that through their meditation people will become creative. That is sheer nonsense, because through that type of meditation the East has suffered much uncreativity. It takes away the tension but it also takes away the thrust into the future. It relaxes you in a way but then you don’t bother about anything. So nobody doing that type of work has been creative. All the great creators have been tense people, almost on the verge of insanity.\nNow, my whole effort here is to give meditation a totally new perspective – so that is relaxes you on the one hand and yet does not take away that challenge, that blissful tension from you. You remain capable of both: in fact your capacity to relax makes you capable of being more tense when it is needed. That’s how it should be – only then can a person be creative. Otherwise one will not be creative. One will simply become lousy, will relapse into a sort of stupidity, into lethargy.\nThe greatest problem about meditation – and in the past in the East we have tried and observed it – is that in ninety-nine persons out of one hundred, it has proved non-creative. The east has lived a very non-creative life. Yes, in a way it is non-tense: people accept slavery, people accept poverty, people accept death – they say it is all okay. All sorts of ugliness is accepted and people have lived at the lowest rung of life, and this is one of the by-products of the so-called meditation .\nThe West has not bothered about meditation, has been very creative, but it has been driving people mad. They are tense, they cannot sleep, they cannot enjoy, they cannot relax. Now both seem to be somehow lopsided. Something like a synthesis is needed, where a person is capable of relaxing whenever he wills it – whenever he wants it he can relax and go into the deepest layer of rest – and whenever he wills, he wants, he can get up and accept the greatest challenge possible.\nThis has to be the future of man. That’s why my emphasis, so much emphasis, is on active meditations. In fact in the East, nothing like it has happened – it has never existed before – so if eastern saints are against me and they cannot understand me, it is not difficult to understand why. Nothing like active meditation, dynamic or chaotic meditation, has ever existed. By meditation they mean a person sitting just like a buddha, silently. Dancing, jumping – this is not meditation... this has not been meditation for them at least. My effort is to join activity, creativity, with relaxation.\nSo you have to watch out for it – inefficiency has not to be accepted; one has to fight against it, total fight is needed. Whatsoever you can do to overcome it, you have to do – but that should not make you tense!\nWhat I mean is that if you have been working the whole day against a certain problem, that should not make you so tense that in the night you cannot sleep. When you enter your bedroom you drop it outside the bedroom and you sleep as if you have been playing the whole day and you have not been working on any tension-producing thing.\nWherever you find some inefficiency, fight with it, because that is the only way to grow. And whenever you feel that now it is enough, that you are tired and now it is getting on your nerves, relax, accept. Acceptance is for relaxation, challenge is for creativity, and somehow you have to manage these two very contradictory things: challenge and acceptance. If challenge is lost, acceptance becomes death; if acceptance is lost, challenge becomes madness. Nothing has to be dropped – both have to be brought to a synchronicity, some higher synthesis.\nSo these two things you do.… First you allow me, mm? And there is no need to worry – just allow me and let things happen and every group will start being different and your thrill will be back.\nYou cannot fail with me – failure and success are mine! Simply drop that idea, and enjoy! If something new starts happening, allow it. There is no need to worry about whether this will work or not – that is not your problem, that is my problem. You cannot find such opportunity anywhere else because I take the whole responsibility! Simply go ahead. Inefficiency has not to be allowed at all, so think about, contemplate on, new ways – and much can be done.\nHypnosis is such a vital phenomenon that, in fact, in the future it is going to become one of the most important sciences. There is going to come one day when physics will not be so important as hypnosis and a hypnotist will be more respected than a physicist. Those days are bound to come because hypnosis carries the whole future of human beings.\nIf physics says something about matter hypnosis says something about consciousness, how consciousness works. And hypnosis is not just hypnosis – it is a thousand and one things more, and they all have to be investigated.\nThese groups can help you to work deeper. You will not find anywhere such trusting people, surrendered people – you can lead them as far as possible. And soon I will create possibilities, situations, where deeper groups will be possible and then longer groups – a one month hypnosis group – so you can take them as tar away as possible from the world.\n... Always find new ways and follow them.\n[Another sannyasin says that he is in difficulty in the relationship with his girlfriend and wonders whether to continue it or not. Osho suggests he just watch how things go for a while, rather than making a hasty decision.]\nDon’t be in a hurry, because what happens is that the mind has light moments and dark moments, day moments and night moments. When it is a day moment everything feels very good – you can see everything clearly; when night comes everything become dark and you cannot see anything clearly. There is every possibility you may decide something when it was nighttime, a dark moment, a low energy moment. If you decide something in that moment, it will not be wisebecause you\nhave seen beautiful moments also with this woman.\nJust think: we are sitting here, it is light, you can see me and you can see everybody here, you can see the trees – and then suddenly the electricity goes off. Now you cannot see anybody here – the trees and everything are gone. Will you say that now the trees no more exist and the people no more exist? If you say that, that will be too early a decision. Can’t you remember that there was a light a few moments ago and people were there and the trees were green and everything was there and things were clear?\nWhen the night is there, remember the day too – don’t forget it – and soon the day will be coming. Whenever you have to decide, it is always good to decide in daytime – then your life will have a positivity. If you decide in the nighttime your life will become negative. That’s my distinction between a man who is religious and a man who is not religious: the non-religious man always decides about\nhis life in the nighttime, he decides in a negative state. That’s why he cannot say god is – he says there is no god. All no’s together become a big no: ‘there is no god.’ All yes’s together become a big yes: ‘yes, there is god!’\nSo wait! Decisions have to be made when there is light. When you are again loving this woman and things are flowing and everything is beautiful, ecstatic, then decide, and if you want to separate, separate! But don’t decide in the nighttime – that’s why I say to prolong it, to watch. Mm ? this will go.\nAnd there is a third state also, the transcendental. When you have seen both the day and the night again and again and again, then you know that something is higher than both – you, your witnessing capacity, is higher than both.\nSo there are three kinds of decisions. The first kind is a negative kind which makes life a desert. Then nothing blooms – it is a frustration, it is hell! The second kind of decision is the ‘yes’ decision, the daytime decision – life becomes a joy, a celebration. There is delight and one feels very happy to be: this is what heaven is, paradise. And the third is neither light nor darkness – one simply decides out of one’s witnessing; out of all of the experiences of day and night together, one decides. That is the ultimate decision, that is what makes a man enlightened. So just wait, watch, see, and let the daytime come, mm? then decide. Good!\n[A sannyasin says: Oh, I’m such a mess!... I’m ashamed of myself and I don’t know what to do.] Do you enjoy it or not – this being in a mess? My feeling is that you enjoy it! Not really... not really?\nThen you can drop it – there is no problem. Why carry it ? A subtle enjoyment must be there... otherwise you are such a happy person. My understanding about you is this – you may try to prove it wrong, but my understanding is that you are a happy person.\n[She asks: But why am I doing it, why am I trying to hurt myself? Can’t somebody try to help me to understand it?]\nYes, I will help you see why you are doing it. There are many thingsFirstly, for your whole life you\nhave been repressing your happy quality. Basically you are a happy person. [She says: I was a happy child – I think so.]\nYes, you must have been a happy child and you can be a happy old woman – there is no problem in it. It is just that your whole life you have tried to repress it – reasons must have been there, situations must have been there, but you have repressed it. Now, that repression has become almost automatic, it works on its own. Unless you try to drag yourself, it is difficult to get out of it... but naturally you are a happy person. When I received your letter I was surprised, because my understanding about you from the very first day has been that you are a very happy person. I would like you to become part of the ashram – I like your quality so much.\nWhen I received your letter I was surprised because this must be then just a mechanism that you have gathered through your life. I know you have suffered, I know you have been in sad moments,\nit has been a nightmarish life – but it is past... you can get out of it! It is just habit that gets on your nerves again and again. A little understanding – that it has to be dropped, it is no more, it is irrelevant: those people are gone, that husband is gone, that life is gone; you are finished with it. That person that you used to be is no more.… You are a new person, a sannyasin! Start from ABC – laugh like a child, start thinking of yourself as a child. Play around!\n... It will come! I know what it is... I know – it will come. Just do a few thingsOne thing: stop being\nserious – laugh more, make people laugh more. [She answers: I can’t do that!]\nTry! Never say ‘can’t’! Never say ‘can’t’, because I have never seen anything that can’t be done. If you say ‘can’t’ then it becomes difficult. Try, give it a try! What can you lose? You can lose at the most, your misery – nothing to be worried about! Try to laugh, help people to laugh .…\n... My feeling is – and I have enquired about you because I was worried about what was happening.… People say that when they come close to you, you close.…\nYes – so don’t close! If you close, then they don’t come. When they don’t come, you feel bad, you feel that they are avoiding you.It will go – it is just a mechanism, it is not a big problem. There are\npeople who really have a problem – people whose energy from their very childhood has been sad. They are the real problem people – it is almost impossible to bring them out of it. It is not a habit, it is their nature. Yours is just a habit – it Is not your nature. Hold hands, hug people. Forget that you are old you are not old, nobody is!\n... You feel old because you see so many young people and you compare; you see so many happy people laughing and enjoying and holding and hugging – comparison arises. And then you start remembering your life – you never did those things when you were young. You never laughed, you never danced, and these people are enjoying. You feel jealous. You feel jealous of these people... the whole world will feel jealous of these people if they come to know about them! (laughter) I am creating such people that really everybody will feel jealous – people with no inhibitions, with no taboos; they are really enjoying (laughter).with no guilt, nothing!\n[To a group leader], help her, mm? Whenever you find her, just hold her and hug her and don’t bother whether she closes or not. Just bring her out of it. She will come, and she will become a beautiful person once she comes out of it. So to everybody here this work is given, mm? [She] has to be brought out of it! (laughter)\n[A sannyasin, who is a Karate instructor, says his problem is anger. He tries to watch it but watching only makes him more angry.\nOsho checks his energy.]\nNothing to be worried about, mm? And don’t take anger as anger – it is just energy. You have too much energy and you don’t know where or how to put it. When you cannot put that energy anywhere, it hangs heavy on you – anger seems to be an easy release. It is just too much energy – more than you need for your work – so the remaining part becomes anger. It is not directed to anything – it\nis simply there – so you cannot release it either. And if you watch it, it will grow more, because in watching you will stop doing other things in which the energy was getting lost; that energy will be saved even more.\nWhen you are not watching there are many ways in which you are losing energy, knowingly, unknowingly – unconscious channels where energy is lost and dissipated. When you are watching you become a pool of energy – you will become more angry. And the problem is that the anger is not directed to anybody, so anything like Primal (therapy) cannot help you. It is not anger – beating somebody, hitting somebody, won’t help.\nIf you stop Karate you will become more angry. Karate is good – it takes up much of your energy. Anything silent like t’ai chi will drive you crazy – that is not for you. In fact the whole science of Karate was developed for people who have more than normal energy. Only these people can become warriors, these people can become Samurai – those who have more energy than the normal. They have always been a part of humanity – twenty-five percent, one forth of humanity.\nIn India we have divided the whole society into four sciences. Twenty-five percent people are born brahmins. I am a born brahmin: I cannot do anything else, I can just sit silently and seeEven to\nmove the hand is too much. Twenty-five percent of people are brahmins, born brahmins, twenty-five percent are warriors – chatriyas, we call them in India. Samurais are the second type of people, the warriors. The third twenty-five percent of people are business people. They are neither interested in knowing nor in conquering – they are interested in hoarding money, this and that; they are thing- oriented.\nTwenty-five percent of people are not interested in anything – neither in knowing nor in conquering, neither in being victorious nor in knowledge, neither in power nor in money. They simply want to eat, drink and go to sleep. They don’t bother about anything – they have no ambition, not any ambition... lethargic; we call them sudhras.\nThere are four types of people and there have been four types of societies in the world. When Karate and things like that developed, the warrior was the topmost in Japan – he was dominating the society, he was on the top of the society. It was a warrior country and a warrior century.\nIn America, the third type of people is dominant – the businessman; it is the country of the businessman. If you have money you are all – nothing else is important. In the ancient days India was a brahmin country – if you were a knower, you were all; even kings would come to touch your feet. A beggar, but brahmin, was more valuable than the emperor himself. You could conquer the whole world but that was nothing – if you could see yourself, that was more valuable. The society was dominated by the brahmin. In Russia, the fourth type – the sudhra, the proletarian-dominant.\nSo there have been these four types of man and four types of society in the past, and that is the only way a society can be – some type of person becomes dominant. You are basically a warrior. It is not anger... it is just pure energy, it is fuel, and you don’t know what to do with it. It is good that you have chosen Karate – it has been an intuitive choice. It is good, and don’t change it – go deeply into it, go totally into it, forget everything. And don’t think of your energy as anger – that is a wrong interpretation; think of it as energy. And when you feel the energy is there, go into Karate.\nBecome more inventive, find more ways to go into it, go deeper into it.\nAnd you know now the basic – now you can develop it on your own; there are a thousand and one possibilities. So don’t be worried and don’t make it a problem – it is not a problem. Simply accept it and go into it.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"6250","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/this_is_it/part3/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/this_is_it/>This Is It</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">3</h1><div class=post-meta>30 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;6250 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/This_Is_It/part3.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part2>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

to stay.]</p><p><br></p><p>One never knows! And that’s the beauty of life – that there is always
surprise and there is always the unexpected... and because the
unexpected happens there is joy, excitement, ecstasy. Whenever only the
expected starts happening, joy dies. Then one just leads a dried, dead,
fossil-like life. The more of the unexpected there is, the more one
lives. Life is the unexpected and with the unexpected, so always remain
available to the unexpected – that very availability makes one alive.
There are very few people in the world who are really alive – most are
just alive corpses. They look alive, appear to be alive, but the
unexpected has stopped happening. Now, that is ugly: they know they will
be repeating their yesterday, they know what they will be doing even in
their next life. If they have to live for eternity they will go on just
like a wheel moving again and again and again – just a broken gramophone
record which goes on repeating the same line.</p><p><br></p><p>The unexpected is the ecstatic moment, the unexpected is what god is,
so remain available to the unexpected I And the more available you are,
the more it will be coming – because it comes many times but we are
closed.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, it was not a necessity that you should become a sannyasin; you
had just come to meet your friend. You could have remained closed, but
you opened up. A new beginning starts, something new has entered in your
life – now you will not be the same ever!</p><p><br></p><p>And this simple step of being a sannyasin will have tremendous
impact. It will open more doors – and life is a thrill when you know
that something unexpected is still possible.</p><p><br></p><p>[A new sannyasin said she would like to learn T’ai Chi.]</p><p><br></p><p>T’ai chi is very good, mm? But when the body is unburdened of
repressed emotions and energy starts flowing, then T’ai Chi is just the
right thing to do. But just wait... Just wait a little, mm? Always
remember, everything has a particular time, a particular season and a
particular climate. First create the season and the climate. Let there
be spring, then flowers come very easily. Otherwise sometimes in the
wrong season, in the wrong climate, you can go on working hard and
nothing will happen. My experience with T’ai Chi is that if a person has
many repressed emotions, those emotions become like a wall around the
diaphragm. He cannot feel the hara, the T’ai Chi centre. Even if you
tell him that it is there, just below the navel, two inches below the
navel, he cannot feel it. He can believe it, he can imagine it, but he
cannot feel it – and unless you feel it exactly where it is, t’ai chi
doesn’t start. You have to be focused there, centred there – there is
the source of your ‘chi’, your energy.</p><p>But unless one has thrown all the repressed emotions<span class=s4></span>Anger, greed, jealousy, and a thousand</p><p>and one things are there and we go on piling them up in the stomach
because that is the only empty space in the body. So whatsoever you want
to throw, you throw it there – either throw it out or throw it in; only
two are the ways.</p><p><br></p><p>Catharsis means throwing it out so it doesn’t spoil your system. If a
person is in a situation where he wants to scream and he does not –
maybe there are so many people and it will look odd; they will think him
bizarre, mad, crazy and he himself thinks that it is crazy – where will
he throw it? Where will the scream go? He will push it down inside the
stomach, he will sit upon it. Now the scream will be pressed like a
spring: you can sit upon a spring, but the spring is there and any
moment that you go away the spring will uncoil. You go on repressing
millions of things every day in this way – the stomach is too much
burdened – then suddenly you start T’ai Chi. You cannot feel where your
‘chi’ centre is. You have lost all contact, because between you and the
‘chi’ centre there is such rubbish, a mountain of rubbish. That mountain
has to be removed first. Once it is removed – once your ‘chi’ centre
starts functioning well and you can see it directly; you can relate to
it not in imagination but actually, you can start feeling your life
energy bubbling there – then things become very simple and T’ai Chi
comes very very easily.</p><p>So just finish a few groups and then I will suggest you do T’ai Chi,
but go on asking me so I remember, mm?</p><p><br></p><p>[Osho suggests to a sannyasin, who is leaving for the West, it will
be good to start a centre in his home. People are in such deep need –
they only need to be made aware of something like meditation and they
will come running. Osho encourages sannyasins who are returning to the
west to be involved in the running of meditation centres, because the
work helps them to stay in contact with him, apart from helping to
introduce others to Osho and to meditation. As buddha stressed the
importance of one growing in compassion and meditation simultaneously,
Osho too says it is important to share whatever one attains with others.
Otherwise one tends to become too self- centred and unconcerned about
the welfare of others. And in sharing, one receives more: the more one
gives, the more one receives.]</p><p>[A visitor says: I wish to ask whether this is sensible – whether
external science can lead towards internal yoga, and whether my feeling
that this may eventually provide the way for the race as a whole to be
transformed, is real.]</p><p><br></p><p>Mm mm... it is complicated! Firstly, it is as if to come to this
place where you are sitting, you start</p><p><br></p><p>moving away from this spot. Yes, one day you will come back if you go
on moving away, away, away – the earth is round, one day you will come
back to this place – but this is an unnecessary journey. To come to the
internal by going to the external, yes, one day you will come.
Mathematically it is not wrong – you will come – because all energies
move in a circle. If you go to the very furthest end of externality,
there will be a turn of the energy and you will start coming back – but
why? For that which was so easily available, why go that far?</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard about a man who was driving fast, somewhere near New
Delhi. He asked a villager – because he was feeling a little lost – ‘If
I go in this direction will I ever reach Delhi?’ The villager said, ‘You
will reach but you will have to go around the whole earth because you
have left Delhi behind by eight miles! But if you turn back, Delhi is
very close by.’ Logically it is right – I will not say it is wrong. If
you really go it will take many lives; this life won’t be enough, this
life is very short. You cannot go to the very end of the external – it
is an infinity; to exhaust it will be almost impossible. But if you
exhaust it, then there is a turn. Space is curved: if you go on, go on,
go on, then one day you start coming home. Everything moves in a circle
so you are bound to come home, but I don’t see that there is any need in
the first place. If you are enjoying it, it is perfectly good – go that
way, mm? I never want to distract anybody from anything. I don’t even
distract a person who is going to commit a sin, because if he goes into
it he will become a saint. Where can he go in the sin? One day he will
start moving towards sainthood. In fact the best way to become a great
saint is to become a great sinner. This is doing something, which could
have been done very easily, in the hard way, but there are people who
like the hard way. . .then it is perfectly good.</p><p>The second thing: when you start thinking of the whole world, you are
avoiding something about yourself. Yes, if you go on working on external
things<span class=s4></span>One day science may start becoming
more</p><p>religious – it has already started – and it will be a great boon to
humanity; but when? It will take centuries, but meanwhile what happens
to you? – one thing. The second thing: if the people who are working in
science don’t have some interiority, then science will take even longer
to become religion. Just think: if einstein, max plank, eddington,
people like them – if they were great meditators then that utopia would
have already happened. By the end of his life, eddington started feeling
that he had missed something. Just at the end he started feeling that
the world was not like a thing, it is like a thought – but just at the
end. Just at the end he started feeling that whatsoever he had thought
about this world was not right... and so was the case with Albert
Einstein. Just in the last days he started feeling that the mystery was
not destroyed – rather, it had become even deeper than before.</p><p>If one works in the scientific world, one day one will start feeling
it... but this will be a feeling. It remained a feeling with Einstein –
he died a non-meditator.</p><p><br></p><p>My suggestion is – just a humble suggestion because I don’t say to do
it – my suggestion is: go on working on whatsoever external things you
want to but side by side go on working on the internal too. Let there be
a balance so that if you can contribute something, good; if nothing is
contributed, you don’t miss it! And if you become silent, if you become
aware, humanity becomes aware through you – because who are you, who am
I? We are not separate!</p><p><br></p><p>A single individual becoming silent, blissful, is a part of humanity
becoming silent, blissful, happy. Something in humanity has happened
through him. Humanity will never be the same again because this man
meditated.</p><p><br></p><p>It has never been the same since Buddha or since Christ; and they
were not working on anything</p><p><br></p><p>external: they were working on their internal, their innermost core.
But since Buddha arrived home, became enlightened, humanity has never
been the same – cannot be – because Buddha is absorbed by existence.
Through him we have all evolved. If even a single drop of the ocean
becomes enlightened, the ocean has become enlightened in part and that
enlightenment spreads all over the ocean. The total energy goes higher,
new visions arise in humanity, new songs are born.</p><p><br></p><p>So my suggestion is that it is good, working on the external is
perfectly right, enjoy it, but let it be your hobby, not your work –
work should be internal. It is good to keep both, and there is no
contradiction in them, no, not at all – the inner and the outer fit
together, they are aspects of one phenomenon. They are not opposite;
they are complementaries.</p><p><br></p><p>So a man can work in the lab and forget about himself utterly, and
then can come home and forget the lab utterly and go into himself and
meditate, and this man will have the right balance.</p><p><br></p><p>And the more capable you become of meditation, the deeper will be
your thrust into the external, and the deeper your thrust into the
external, the deeper will be your capacity to move in – because it is
you: if you can move out, why cannot you move in ? If you can move in,
why cannot you move out – it is you! Out and in don’t matter; that is
only a question of direction. If you can rush away from me, why cannot
you rush towards me? You are the same man – just the direction
changes.</p><p><br></p><p>Very good – go on working, but start going into meditation also. Come
back if you can some time and stay a little longer, mm? Good.</p><p><br></p><p>[The hypnotherapy group is present. The leader asked about the
difference between letting things happen, following his feelings, and
doing what he feels he ought to. It was not a big problem but he wanted
to look at it now.]</p><p><br></p><p>Mm mm. It is not something big but it can grow into something big, so
your feeling is right. It is just a small seed but it can grow, it can
become very big. It is better to understand it while it is just in seed;
then it can easily be changed, dropped, transformed – a thousand and one
things are possible. Once it becomes very big, it becomes more and more
difficult, it becomes more complicated.</p><p><br></p><p>The first thing that you may not have looked into: you are still
working on your own. Let me work! That’s where the crux of the problem
is – and if you are working on your own you will get into many troubles.
First, you will get tired, bored, because you will be doing the same
thing again and again. If you are working on your own how can you avoid
the fact that it is the same thing ? One gets fed up – it is natural;
one gets tired, bored. When something is new one is excited. Doing the
same group again and again, going through the same problems with the
same type of people, it becomes tiring. Then you lose your feeling for
it, you have to do it mechanically: when you start doing it mechanically
of course you feel it is like prostitution .</p><p><br></p><p>That is the problem each groupleader has to face. But those who have
dropped working on their own do not have to face it; they don’t carry a
psychological memory of it. In fact, rather than doing the group you are
just allowing me to do it. That will bring a great change. You are not
burdened – if it succeeds you don’t succeed, if it fails you don’t fail;
if everything goes well it’s good, if nothing goes well that too is
good.</p><p><br></p><p>Then you are simply absent in a way, you don’t collect a
psychological memory, and then each time you will not feel the group as
a repetition because you don’t collect it as your own. And once this
happens your creativity will be released.</p><p><br></p><p>The ego is very non-creative. Ordinarily people think that unless you
are egoistic, how can you be creative?</p><p><br></p><p>The ordinary understanding – which is a misunderstanding – is that
the ego is creative. The ego is hot creative; at the most it can be
constructive, not creative. At the most it can create some innovations,
but those are not discoveries. All discoveries are made in a non-ego
state.</p><p><br></p><p>Innovation is one thing – it is just like redecorating the room: the
room is the same, the furniture is the same, the pictures are the same,
the paintings are the same. You are simply redecorating; white-washing,
changing a colour here and there, just putting things in a new
arrangement. It is constructive, not creative: it is just the old
rearranged, readjusted.</p><p><br></p><p>Creativity is something utterly new, discontinuous with your past.
The ego is continuity with the past, hence it can never be creative. The
ego has to give way. And when I say to let me work, it is just a simple
device – not that I am going to work... I am not that foolish!
(laughter) If I am unburdening you, don’t think that I will burden
myself! (chuckling) Not at all! It is just a device: you love me and it
will be easy for you to drop the ego in my name. Just in dropping it,
something bigger than you starts functioning. Then the ego is no more in
the way, you are simply available to the group. There will be much
creativity, many new things will start happening – many new experiences
that you had not expected ever will suddenly be there, many spontaneous
happenings – and then there will be thrill, excitement, ecstasy and you
will be flowing again .</p><p><br></p><p>So the first thing is to drop the idea that you are doing the group,
and whenever this idea comes, just take hold of the locket in your hand
and repeat loudly, ‘Osho, Osho, Osho...’ Let them laugh! Mm? drop the
ego immediately – their laughter will also help. They will say, ’So,
[the group leader] is also like us – nothing to be worried about! He is
also in the same boat. They will feel very happy. The first thing.…</p><p><br></p><p>And the second thing: there is a very delicate difference between
acceptance and inefficiency. Many people start thinking that their
inefficiency is acceptance; it is not. They are being tricky and they
are deceiving themselves.</p><p><br></p><p>Acceptance makes you more capable, acceptance helps you grow.
Acceptance makes you more intelligent; it does not dull you. With
acceptance you are not stuck. Acceptance does not mean that you have
accepted your failure, no. Acceptance does not mean that you have
accepted your limitations, that you don’t care, that you don’t bother,
that it is okay; acceptance does not mean that it is okay.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, these are two things: something is happening which you can
accept out of inefficiency because you know you cannot do anything more
about it. You feel the limitation, you are at the end of your rope and
you know it. Rather than saying that you are at the end of your rope, it
is better to say that you live in acceptance so whatsoever happens is
good. This is camouflage, a rationalisation. If this happens again and
again, you will lose all creativity, you will lose that blissful tension
that</p><p><br></p><p>creates creativity. This is something to be understood: these
so-called meditators – for example tm meditators – think that through
their meditation people will become creative. That is sheer nonsense,
because through that type of meditation the East has suffered much
uncreativity. It takes away the tension but it also takes away the
thrust into the future. It relaxes you in a way but then you don’t
bother about anything. So nobody doing that type of work has been
creative. All the great creators have been tense people, almost on the
verge of insanity.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, my whole effort here is to give meditation a totally new
perspective – so that is relaxes you on the one hand and yet does not
take away that challenge, that blissful tension from you. You remain
capable of both: in fact your capacity to relax makes you capable of
being more tense when it is needed. That’s how it should be – only then
can a person be creative. Otherwise one will not be creative. One will
simply become lousy, will relapse into a sort of stupidity, into
lethargy.</p><p><br></p><p>The greatest problem about meditation – and in the past in the East
we have tried and observed it – is that in ninety-nine persons out of
one hundred, it has proved non-creative. The east has lived a very
non-creative life. Yes, in a way it is non-tense: people accept slavery,
people accept poverty, people accept death – they say it is all okay.
All sorts of ugliness is accepted and people have lived at the lowest
rung of life, and this is one of the by-products of the so-called
meditation .</p><p><br></p><p>The West has not bothered about meditation, has been very creative,
but it has been driving people mad. They are tense, they cannot sleep,
they cannot enjoy, they cannot relax. Now both seem to be somehow
lopsided. Something like a synthesis is needed, where a person is
capable of relaxing whenever he wills it – whenever he wants it he can
relax and go into the deepest layer of rest – and whenever he wills, he
wants, he can get up and accept the greatest challenge possible.</p><p><br></p><p>This has to be the future of man. That’s why my emphasis, so much
emphasis, is on active meditations. In fact in the East, nothing like it
has happened – it has never existed before – so if eastern saints are
against me and they cannot understand me, it is not difficult to
understand why. Nothing like active meditation, dynamic or chaotic
meditation, has ever existed. By meditation they mean a person sitting
just like a buddha, silently. Dancing, jumping – this is not
meditation... this has not been meditation for them at least. My effort
is to join activity, creativity, with relaxation.</p><p><br></p><p>So you have to watch out for it – inefficiency has not to be
accepted; one has to fight against it, total fight is needed. Whatsoever
you can do to overcome it, you have to do – but that should not make you
tense!</p><p><br></p><p>What I mean is that if you have been working the whole day against a
certain problem, that should not make you so tense that in the night you
cannot sleep. When you enter your bedroom you drop it outside the
bedroom and you sleep as if you have been playing the whole day and you
have not been working on any tension-producing thing.</p><p><br></p><p>Wherever you find some inefficiency, fight with it, because that is
the only way to grow. And whenever you feel that now it is enough, that
you are tired and now it is getting on your nerves, relax, accept.
Acceptance is for relaxation, challenge is for creativity, and somehow
you have to manage these two very contradictory things: challenge and
acceptance. If challenge is lost, acceptance becomes death; if
acceptance is lost, challenge becomes madness. Nothing has to be dropped
– both have to be brought to a synchronicity, some higher synthesis.</p><p><br></p><p>So these two things you do.… First you allow me, mm? And there is no
need to worry – just allow me and let things happen and every group will
start being different and your thrill will be back.</p><p><br></p><p>You cannot fail with me – failure and success are mine! Simply drop
that idea, and enjoy! If something new starts happening, allow it. There
is no need to worry about whether this will work or not – that is not
your problem, that is my problem. You cannot find such opportunity
anywhere else because I take the whole responsibility! Simply go ahead.
Inefficiency has not to be allowed at all, so think about, contemplate
on, new ways – and much can be done.</p><p><br></p><p>Hypnosis is such a vital phenomenon that, in fact, in the future it
is going to become one of the most important sciences. There is going to
come one day when physics will not be so important as hypnosis and a
hypnotist will be more respected than a physicist. Those days are bound
to come because hypnosis carries the whole future of human beings.</p><p><br></p><p>If physics says something about matter hypnosis says something about
consciousness, how consciousness works. And hypnosis is not just
hypnosis – it is a thousand and one things more, and they all have to be
investigated.</p><p><br></p><p>These groups can help you to work deeper. You will not find anywhere
such trusting people, surrendered people – you can lead them as far as
possible. And soon I will create possibilities, situations, where deeper
groups will be possible and then longer groups – a one month hypnosis
group – so you can take them as tar away as possible from the world.</p><p><br></p><p>... Always find new ways and follow them.</p><p><br></p><p>[Another sannyasin says that he is in difficulty in the relationship
with his girlfriend and wonders whether to continue it or not. Osho
suggests he just watch how things go for a while, rather than making a
hasty decision.<span class=s4></span>]</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t be in a hurry, because what happens is that the mind has light
moments and dark moments, day moments and night moments. When it is a
day moment everything feels very good – you can see everything clearly;
when night comes everything become dark and you cannot see anything
clearly. There is every possibility you may decide something when it was
nighttime, a dark moment, a low energy moment. If you decide something
in that moment, it will not be wise<span class=s4></span>because
you</p><p>have seen beautiful moments also with this woman.</p><p><br></p><p>Just think: we are sitting here, it is light, you can see me and you
can see everybody here, you can see the trees – and then suddenly the
electricity goes off. Now you cannot see anybody here – the trees and
everything are gone. Will you say that now the trees no more exist and
the people no more exist? If you say that, that will be too early a
decision. Can’t you remember that there was a light a few moments ago
and people were there and the trees were green and everything was there
and things were clear?</p><p><br></p><p>When the night is there, remember the day too – don’t forget it – and
soon the day will be coming. Whenever you have to decide, it is always
good to decide in daytime – then your life will have a positivity. If
you decide in the nighttime your life will become negative. That’s my
distinction between a man who is religious and a man who is not
religious: the non-religious man always decides about</p><p><br></p><p>his life in the nighttime, he decides in a negative state. That’s why
he cannot say god is – he says there is no god. All no’s together become
a big no: ‘there is no god.’ All yes’s together become a big yes: ‘yes,
there is god!’</p><p><br></p><p>So wait! Decisions have to be made when there is light. When you are
again loving this woman and things are flowing and everything is
beautiful, ecstatic, then decide, and if you want to separate, separate!
But don’t decide in the nighttime – that’s why I say to prolong it, to
watch. Mm ? this will go.</p><p><br></p><p>And there is a third state also, the transcendental. When you have
seen both the day and the night again and again and again, then you know
that something is higher than both – you, your witnessing capacity, is
higher than both.</p><p><br></p><p>So there are three kinds of decisions. The first kind is a negative
kind which makes life a desert. Then nothing blooms – it is a
frustration, it is hell! The second kind of decision is the ‘yes’
decision, the daytime decision – life becomes a joy, a celebration.
There is delight and one feels very happy to be: this is what heaven is,
paradise. And the third is neither light nor darkness – one simply
decides out of one’s witnessing; out of all of the experiences of day
and night together, one decides. That is the ultimate decision, that is
what makes a man enlightened. So just wait, watch, see, and let the
daytime come, mm? then decide. Good!</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin says: Oh, I’m such a mess!... I’m ashamed of myself and
I don’t know what to do.] Do you enjoy it or not – this being in a mess?
My feeling is that you enjoy it! Not really... not really?</p><p>Then you can drop it – there is no problem. Why carry it ? A subtle
enjoyment must be there... otherwise you are such a happy person. My
understanding about you is this – you may try to prove it wrong, but my
understanding is that you are a happy person.</p><p><br></p><p>[She asks: But why am I doing it, why am I trying to hurt myself?
Can’t somebody try to help me to understand it?]</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, I will help you see why you are doing it. There are many
things<span class=s4></span>Firstly, for your whole life you</p><p>have been repressing your happy quality. Basically you are a happy
person. [She says: I was a happy child – I think so.]</p><p>Yes, you must have been a happy child and you can be a happy old
woman – there is no problem in it. It is just that your whole life you
have tried to repress it – reasons must have been there, situations must
have been there, but you have repressed it. Now, that repression has
become almost automatic, it works on its own. Unless you try to drag
yourself, it is difficult to get out of it... but naturally you are a
happy person. When I received your letter I was surprised, because my
understanding about you from the very first day has been that you are a
very happy person. I would like you to become part of the ashram – I
like your quality so much.</p><p><br></p><p>When I received your letter I was surprised because this must be then
just a mechanism that you have gathered through your life. I know you
have suffered, I know you have been in sad moments,</p><p><br></p><p>it has been a nightmarish life – but it is past... you can get out of
it! It is just habit that gets on your nerves again and again. A little
understanding – that it has to be dropped, it is no more, it is
irrelevant: those people are gone, that husband is gone, that life is
gone; you are finished with it. That person that you used to be is no
more.… You are a new person, a sannyasin! Start from ABC – laugh like a
child, start thinking of yourself as a child. Play around!</p><p><br></p><p>... It will come! I know what it is... I know – it will come. Just do
a few things<span class=s4></span>One thing: stop being</p><p>serious – laugh more, make people laugh more. [She answers: I can’t
do that!]</p><p>Try! Never say ‘can’t’! Never say ‘can’t’, because I have never seen
anything that can’t be done. If you say ‘can’t’ then it becomes
difficult. Try, give it a try! What can you lose? You can lose at the
most, your misery – nothing to be worried about! Try to laugh, help
people to laugh .…</p><p><br></p><p>... My feeling is – and I have enquired about you because I was
worried about what was happening.… People say that when they come close
to you, you close.…</p><p><br></p><p>Yes – so don’t close! If you close, then they don’t come. When they
don’t come, you feel bad, you feel that they are avoiding you.<span class=s4></span>It will go – it is just a mechanism, it is not a big
problem. There are</p><p>people who really have a problem – people whose energy from their
very childhood has been sad. They are the real problem people – it is
almost impossible to bring them out of it. It is not a habit, it is
their nature. Yours is just a habit – it Is not your nature. Hold hands,
hug people. Forget that you are old you are not old, nobody is!</p><p><br></p><p>... You feel old because you see so many young people and you
compare; you see so many happy people laughing and enjoying and holding
and hugging – comparison arises. And then you start remembering your
life – you never did those things when you were young. You never
laughed, you never danced, and these people are enjoying. You feel
jealous. You feel jealous of these people... the whole world will feel
jealous of these people if they come to know about them! (laughter) I am
creating such people that really everybody will feel jealous – people
with no inhibitions, with no taboos; they are really enjoying
(laughter).<span class=s4></span>with no guilt, nothing!</p><p><br></p><p>[To a group leader], help her, mm? Whenever you find her, just hold
her and hug her and don’t bother whether she closes or not. Just bring
her out of it. She will come, and she will become a beautiful person
once she comes out of it. So to everybody here this work is given, mm?
[She] has to be brought out of it! (laughter)</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin, who is a Karate instructor, says his problem is anger.
He tries to watch it but watching only makes him more angry.</p><p><br></p><p>Osho checks his energy.]</p><p><br></p><p>Nothing to be worried about, mm? And don’t take anger as anger – it
is just energy. You have too much energy and you don’t know where or how
to put it. When you cannot put that energy anywhere, it hangs heavy on
you – anger seems to be an easy release. It is just too much energy –
more than you need for your work – so the remaining part becomes anger.
It is not directed to anything – it</p><p><br></p><p>is simply there – so you cannot release it either. And if you watch
it, it will grow more, because in watching you will stop doing other
things in which the energy was getting lost; that energy will be saved
even more.</p><p><br></p><p>When you are not watching there are many ways in which you are losing
energy, knowingly, unknowingly – unconscious channels where energy is
lost and dissipated. When you are watching you become a pool of energy –
you will become more angry. And the problem is that the anger is not
directed to anybody, so anything like Primal (therapy) cannot help you.
It is not anger – beating somebody, hitting somebody, won’t help.</p><p><br></p><p>If you stop Karate you will become more angry. Karate is good – it
takes up much of your energy. Anything silent like t’ai chi will drive
you crazy – that is not for you. In fact the whole science of Karate was
developed for people who have more than normal energy. Only these people
can become warriors, these people can become Samurai – those who have
more energy than the normal. They have always been a part of humanity –
twenty-five percent, one forth of humanity.</p><p><br></p><p>In India we have divided the whole society into four sciences.
Twenty-five percent people are born brahmins. I am a born brahmin: I
cannot do anything else, I can just sit silently and see<span class=s4></span>Even to</p><p>move the hand is too much. Twenty-five percent of people are
brahmins, born brahmins, twenty-five percent are warriors – chatriyas,
we call them in India. Samurais are the second type of people, the
warriors. The third twenty-five percent of people are business people.
They are neither interested in knowing nor in conquering – they are
interested in hoarding money, this and that; they are thing-
oriented.</p><p><br></p><p>Twenty-five percent of people are not interested in anything –
neither in knowing nor in conquering, neither in being victorious nor in
knowledge, neither in power nor in money. They simply want to eat, drink
and go to sleep. They don’t bother about anything – they have no
ambition, not any ambition... lethargic; we call them sudhras.</p><p><br></p><p>There are four types of people and there have been four types of
societies in the world. When Karate and things like that developed, the
warrior was the topmost in Japan – he was dominating the society, he was
on the top of the society. It was a warrior country and a warrior
century.</p><p><br></p><p>In America, the third type of people is dominant – the businessman;
it is the country of the businessman. If you have money you are all –
nothing else is important. In the ancient days India was a brahmin
country – if you were a knower, you were all; even kings would come to
touch your feet. A beggar, but brahmin, was more valuable than the
emperor himself. You could conquer the whole world but that was nothing
– if you could see yourself, that was more valuable. The society was
dominated by the brahmin. In Russia, the fourth type – the sudhra, the
proletarian-dominant.</p><p><br></p><p>So there have been these four types of man and four types of society
in the past, and that is the only way a society can be – some type of
person becomes dominant. You are basically a warrior. It is not anger...
it is just pure energy, it is fuel, and you don’t know what to do with
it. It is good that you have chosen Karate – it has been an intuitive
choice. It is good, and don’t change it – go deeply into it, go totally
into it, forget everything. And don’t think of your energy as anger –
that is a wrong interpretation; think of it as energy. And when you feel
the energy is there, go into Karate.</p><p><br></p><p>Become more inventive, find more ways to go into it, go deeper into
it.</p><p><br></p><p>And you know now the basic – now you can develop it on your own;
there are a thousand and one possibilities. So don’t be worried and
don’t make it a problem – it is not a problem. Simply accept it and go
into it.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part2>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

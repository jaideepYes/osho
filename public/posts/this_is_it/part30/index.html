Osho reassures her that her heart is open.]\nThat happens many times, because the heart and the mind have become almost disconnected, so whatsoever happens in the heart, the mind does not take note of it, it neglects it. It has neglected it for so long that it has become just a habit. It is happening, but the mind is not recording anything .\nIt is just as if I am speaking and the tape-recorder is broken, it is not recording. It is not that I am not speaking, but it will not record.\nSo your mind is not recording it... and you are too much in the head! It is happening – just wait. By and by your heart will knock more and more loudly – it will speak loud and clear, and then the mind will start taking note of it. Sometimes it takes months, sometimes years, but the heart is very persistent and very patient: it will go on knocking.\nThe heart is never in a hurry because it has no time-consciousness, so the hurry is not possible; it lives in eternity. Time is a mind phenomenon; the heart lives in eternity. It knows the infinite so it can wait, but it is very persistent. It will go on knocking. It is very soft but it is very persistent – like water falling on a rock. Water is soft, feminine, looks so weak, and if you think of it in comparison to the rock, it is almost impotent. The rock is so powerful and looks so potent, but finally one day the rock will disappear. The persistent water falling on it, drop by drop, will destroy it: the rock will be converted into sands and will be taken away and the water will still be flowing. No rock has ever been able to destroy water.\nBut it takes time! So the heart is very soft – it is just like a flower – but the way of the heart is the way of the water. The watercourse way – that’s what Lao tzu calls it. And the mind is like a rock: on the surface very strong, deep inside just bogus. The heart ultimately wins over it.\nIt is happening – I can hear your heart and you will also hear it, but you will have to wait a little. And don’t be in a hurry.\nI can make you hear it but that will be violence. It can be done immediately, right now it can be done, but that will be violence and will not be good, will not be beautiful – can even be harmful.\nSo don’t think about that. Simply go, continue to meditate and continue to remember me. Keep this with you (giving her a box) and whenever you need me, just press it on the heart and remember me. Soon you will start hearing the heart – before you come you will hear it. Good!\n[A sannyasin is worried about her mother. She has always been introverted and difficult to communicate with. She tells Osho that her mother has been admitted twice to hospital with the diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia. The mother lives only in the past. ‘It has to do with the church and with my father; her health is worsening.’]\nShe can be brought out of her mind. Give her as much love as possible when you go back; she needs that.\nMm mm, that’s what is needed. In fact it is love-deficiency that people suffer from. Without love one starts feeling that one is meaningless, useless, a burden. Without love there is no hope and no future – one starts living in the past. Without love there is no communication either. We can communicate only if we love. Without love one starts feeling undernourished, one starts feeling unworthy, and the whole world seems to be against one. One starts being resentful about everything; one is simply complaining.\nThe whole attitude is that somehow life is wrong, everything is wrong and nothing is right. Naturally, if that is the feeling then one starts regressing inwards, starts becoming closed. Only love opens, only love gives an opening.\nSo in fact what she needs is not therapy, what she needs is not expertise. What she needs is simply pure human love, somebody who can again give her hope... somebody who can make her feel worthysomebody who can bring a little ray of light in her life. That you can do, and it will be good\nfor your growth also. If you can help somebody to break through his or her prison it will give you great insight for your own life, because you can face the same problem some day; everybody can have the same problem. If you have helped somebody to come out there are less possibilities that you will have to face the same problem, and if you do, you will be more capable of coping with it. You will be more capable of understanding it and solving it on your own.\nOnly love brings one out of oneself. So goand don’t look at her as a patient, don’t look at her\nas a mental case. She is not – in fact, nobody is. Mental cases exist not; there is nobody who is mad. And all these words – schizophrenia and neurosis and psychosis – are just efforts to label something which we have not yet understood rightly. Out of one hundred cases, ninety-nine are only deficiency cases, something is missing, and that something is always love, more or less.\nThis society is so unloving. It gives great hopes in the beginning and then it frustrates every hope. Every child comes bubbling with joy and wants to celebrate, and by and by he finds that he is being crippled, by and by he finds that there is no possibility to be joyous, by and by he finds that the whole life is nothing but an imprisonment.\nThen all his joy disappears... he becomes stony and hard. Then he is simply protecting himself – that’s all – not living. He is afraid of everybody. Then you can call him paranoid.\nFear is because love is not, fear in itself is symptomatic: it simply shows that love is not. Never take fear as a problem – it is not a problem. It is just a hint from your system that love is needed, urgently needed, desperately needed.\nWhen you love you are completely fearless. When you are in love fear exists not, you are at ease with existence. When you are not in love you are alienated from existence, you fall apart, you are separate, you don’t move with the whole. Then fear and trembling and death and everything.\nThe society is very loveless, the world we have created is absolutely loveless. It has no value for love: it has values for other things but not for love. Love is a disvalue.\nYour mother is suffering from it, and it almost always happens that the people who are very sensitive suffer more than the insensitive people. Insensitive people are thick, dense, mm? – they can tolerate things – but the people who are sensitive are immediately paralysed because of their sensitivity.\nShe must be a sensitive woman.\nShe wanted to really be in love... she wanted to be loved and she wanted to love, and somehow that has not happened.\nIf she were thick she would have tolerated it, she would continue as normal, but she broke her neck in it – she was sensitive. And now at the age of fifty-five all hope has disappeared; life is almost finished.\nSo bring hope to her again. Go, and be very loving.\nThe first thing is not to communicate anything but just to be loving. Hold hands, hug her, just sit by her side, listen to music, meditate, and after a few days – seven, eight days of your loving – you will see that she is opening, the bud is opening... and she will start communicating.\nWhen she starts communicating talk about meditations, about sannyas; talk about what has happened to you, what is happening here. Play some tapes to her, read some book to her and by and by, persuade her to meditate.\nIf she can dance things will immediately change. Put on music, start dancing. Dance is infectious: if you start dancing and doing Nataraj, she will start feeling something. And if you feel that she is getting ready for it, sometimes invite a few more sannyasins to your home; do a meditation. Let her be just there... Let the meditative energy fall on her.\nMy feeling is that she will be able to come out of it. Work is needed, mm? and it can be done – try it!\n[A sannyasin says he has been on drugs for seven years and only stopped taking them three months ago. Since then he has been feeling really vulnerable and very insecure]\nThis is good; to be vulnerable is good. To be vulnerable means to be available – to be available to love, to be available to prayer, to be available to god! Yes, insecurity is good. Security is dead. Life is insecure, because life is always dancing with death – it has to be insecure! Only death is secure. It never dances with life. Death is separate, apart. Life is together with death. So if somebody tries too much to become secure, he becomes that much more dead. It is in the same proportion: death and security are in the same proportion. If you want to be one hundred percent secure you have to be in your grave.\nTo be alive is to be in danger; anything can happen. The more alive you are, the more danger there is. If you want to live one hundred percent totally, you will have to live one hundred percent in danger, in risk. That’s what is happening.very good.\nThose drugs were creating a dead wall around you.drugs are deadening, mm? You are becoming\nmore sensitive – and fear will come, so don’t escape into your old trick.\n[The sannyasin says: I don’t feel like escaping into drugs anymoreThe groups really make me\nfeel good in the daytime but in the evening when the awareness goes, my mind wants to escape with anything – a bottle of beer. Should I fight that or should I drink one or two bottles of beer in the evening?]\nBeer is nothing to be worried about, mm? Beer you can take, and there is no need to fight with it because if you fight too much, then there is again danger.\nBeer is okay – that much can be continued right now, but by and by slowly reduce it. From two bottles come to one, then to half. Then mix water in with it, mm? Slowly reduce it – there is no need to be drastic.\nAnd then I will give you something. When you have come to drink just water I will give you something. through magic you make the water, beer, and drink it!\nThat miracle can be done – the water becomes wine and you can drink it, mm? (chuckling) But don’t show the trick to anybody else, mm?\n[A sannyasin said that he was unable to do any of the visualisation exercises in the hypnotherapy group.]\nYou are an anti-poet – but there are such peoplebut they are good people – nothing to be worried\nabout, mm?\nThere are two types of people: people who are eye-centred; they can visualise easily – and people who are ear-centred; they cannot visualise easily. But the ear-centred people are more musical. They can listen to sounds more easily, they can remember sound more easily than pictures; pictures are difficult for them.\nBut the whole humanity is divided into two types. Plato, who was very much against poets, must have been your type. In his ‘republic’ he said, ‘We will not allow any poets in the city, we will debar them. They are not allowed to be in the city: they are destructive people, dreamy people. They are not realistic enough.’\n... Just accept it, there is nothing wrong in it, mm? your line will be more through the ear.\nAnd there is a problem because all the languages are dominated too much by the eye-centred people. The ear-centred people have not dominated the world – they are more feminine – and the reason is that the ear is a feminine instrument. It simply receives, it cannot project. The eye is more male: it projects. The ear cannot do anything: if I am saying something the ear cannot do anything to it. The ear is just receptive, a passivity, just a hole. The eye is very very active.\nSo the eye is male and the ear is female. Humanity has been male-dominated and as a consequence the eye has dominated. That’s why in all the languages we have words like ‘seer’. When somebody attains to god we call him a ‘seer’. Why? – because the eye has dominated too much.\nYou come here to visit me and it is called ‘darshan’: ‘darshan’ means to see, not to hear. In India, philosophy is called darshan – the way to see. In all the languages of the world the eye is too dominant.\nThere have been people who have reached to truth through the ear – for example, Mohammed: he heard god. Old jewish prophets heard god. It was a hearing, god talked to them; they heard his voice. They must have been ear-oriented people... but such people have not dominated the world; the ear is a repressed organ.\nThe eye-centred have dominated eighty percent; the ear-centred people only twenty, so an ear- dominated person feels a little inadequate. He starts feeling that he is in the minority, he starts feeling that something is wrong in him. Nothing is wrong. You have to work through the ear.\nIf you really want to visualise something you have to visualise through the ear, not through the eye. For example, if you want to remember me, rather than visualising my picture it will be easier for you to visualise my sound. Just like a blind man.…\nOnce it happened that I was travelling in a train. I entered the compartment in the middle of the night and in the compartment there was only one man – a blind man. When I was paying the coolie, he heard me and he immediately said ‘I recognise you!’\nHe said my name, and I said ‘But how did you know? I had completely forgotten about you!’ He said ‘Ten years ago we met in Calcutta. I heard your voice and I remembered.’ He was a singer, a blind singer. It is usually very difficult after ten years but not for a blind man: his memory is of sound.\nSo next time in deep hypnotherapy when the therapist tells you to visualise, tell him ‘I am ear- oriented, so give me something to work through the ear.’ That will do the same, mm? don’t use the eye, use the ear, and you will go into it very deeply. Nothing to be worried about.\n[The sannyasin adds: Also a thing about that is that it resonates through my whole body.]\nPerfectly good! The eye-oriented people are very confined to the head. The ear-oriented people are not so much confined to the head. Sound vibrates the whole body, vision does not; it remains in the eye. That’s why if somebody is singing you start vibrating. You start moving your feet, you start tapping the chair... your whole body vibrates.\nThat’s good – nothing is wrong in it... in fact it is better! But I understand – that whole hypnotherapy group is oriented for the eye people. You will not find a single method in any hypnotherapy book which is oriented to the ear people, mm? ‘Concentrate with the eyes’, ‘look with the eyes’, ‘look at the light’, ‘look at the pendulum’ – but they are all looking; they are not for the ear.\nBut I will tell [the leader of the hypnotherapy group], mm? because a few people will come who are ear-oriented, so he has to work something out for them. It will happen. Good!\n[A sannyasin who is leaving says: I’ve been feeling very cut off. Feeling the impossibility of relating to people. It’s always been there, but in Primal therapy it became very very strong.]\nI wanted to talk about it to you sometime, but I was waiting for you to ask; then I would talk about it. It happens to people who are too intellectual – because all relationship is through the heart. There is no relationship of the mind; there is nothing like intellectual friendship, no.\nTo be related one needs to be a little foolish... and you are not. To relate to people one needs to be non-serious, capable of having a sense of humour, capable of being in fun and being funny, capable of being a human being – which is to be a foolish being!\nYou look as if you are too much in the intellect: from there, there is no relationship. Even if you relate with people you are talking from the head. You don’t come down to the senses, you are not in your senses.\nSo start being a little more foolish, enjoy foolishness a little bit more. A wise man is always a foolish man; a wise man has the capacity to move to the opposite pole also. A man who is simply wise and never foolish is not really a wise man. So be a little more idiotic and you will start feeling alive and that you are relating with people.\nSomehow, too much intellect puts people off – they simply start avoiding you, they withdraw, because intellect is very aggressive. And people are not interested in intellect, and why should they be?\nIntellect has not given anything: no joy, no celebration has ever happened through intellect. Why should they be worried about it? Intellectuals become by and by very alienated individuals. They start living in a citadel, in their own world – worlds of concepts, theories, philosophies. Then they relate with words; they don’t relate with real people.\nSo if you want to relate with real people you will have to become a real person. That’s why after primal you started seeing it more, because primal pulls you down to the earth. Primal is a very very down-to-earth method: it brings you back to your body. It brings you down from your head to your navel, and only when you come to the navel does that scream come, that releasing scream. Now, a scream is not an intellectual thing – a scream is the most non-intellectual thing possible – but it releases something; it makes you again a small child.\nThe insight is good, you are feeling the pain; that is good. Now do something, because if you continue to feel pain too long, you will become accustomed to it; you will become dulled to it.\n... It is hard, but not impossible. It is hard – you just have to be a little more alert and see how you destroy things: when you are talking to somebody, holding somebody’s hand, how you destroy it. You have to be watchful, and do something opposite – exactly the opposite of what you have been doing up to now.\nFor a few days be more playful about new alternative. If somebody asks you a question then watch what your reaction is, how you respond. Is this the old response that you have always been giving? Change it this time! Let it be something new. That is the whole methodology of Zen.…\nThe master will ask a question and the disciple has to be very very inventive, he has to immediately improvise. The master may have asked the same question yesterday and the disciple answered it one way. He asks it again today; if you answer the same way you are rejected.\nFind out a new alternative, do something new! Just watch yourself: whenever you are reacting, responding in the old, stereotype way, structured way, drop it! Maybe you know everything about your old response and there is every possibility that your response will be adequate, but your whole life has become inadequate because of those adequate responses.\nThis time try something inadequate, this time try something foolish. And just watch: if you can be innovative at least twelve times every day – and that is not a big thing – within two, three months you will see that you have started changing; utter change will come to you.\nYou will enjoy new things so much, new ways so much. And in that very enjoyment you will see that people have started coming to you, you have started moving with people and there has arisen an affinity; you are more en rapport with people. Sometimes a very small thing – just a good laugh, sometimes just holding the hand of somebody and crying – can be a great help, can be a great opening.\nYou have to come down from your head; you are stuck there. It is going to be difficult – that’s right – but it is not impossible. And even if it is difficult it has to be done. It is worth it. That difficulty has to be taken on.\n.… Meanwhile try new ways, do something new. Even if you prove foolish – nothing to be worried about: be amateurish!\nThe second thing: listen to the other more. The greatest communicators in the world are those who listen to the other more.\nIt happened once that a man came to me and he talked for at least ninety minutes. I was staying in a friend’s house – the friend and his wife were sitting there with us and they became bored. Mm? – they disappeared into the house and then started feeling worried tor me because the man was going on and on continuously. They were even more worried because I was listening so attentively.\nWhen the man finished his story, he looked at his watch and he said ‘It has been too long – I must go now – but I must say one thing’.… I had not said a single word to him, mm? just yes or no, and that too just to help his story go on. He said ‘You are a wonderful talker!’\nI have always remembered it – that was a beautiful thing that he said! He must have felt that way. And in those ninety minutes I had not talked more than two minutes, three minutes at the most – just here and there just to help – but he said ‘You are a wonderful talker. I will come back.’ And he was so joyful.…\nStart listening, help the other to talk. Don’t you try to communicate – first help him to communicate with you.

<a href=part31>Next ></a></p><p><span id=bookmark29>‌</span>CHAPTER <span class=s3>30</span></p><p><br></p><p>30 May 1977 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin who is leaving says she has been feeling very open
towards Osho but says that just now, as she is leaving, she feels closed
and is sad that she is leaving feeling like this. Osho reassures her
that her heart is open.<span class=s4></span>]</p><p><br></p><p>That happens many times, because the heart and the mind have become
almost disconnected, so whatsoever happens in the heart, the mind does
not take note of it, it neglects it. It has neglected it for so long
that it has become just a habit. It is happening, but the mind is not
recording anything .</p><p><br></p><p>It is just as if I am speaking and the tape-recorder is broken, it is
not recording. It is not that I am not speaking, but it will not
record.</p><p><br></p><p>So your mind is not recording it... and you are too much in the head!
It is happening – just wait. By and by your heart will knock more and
more loudly – it will speak loud and clear, and then the mind will start
taking note of it. Sometimes it takes months, sometimes years, but the
heart is very persistent and very patient: it will go on knocking.</p><p><br></p><p>The heart is never in a hurry because it has no time-consciousness,
so the hurry is not possible; it lives in eternity. Time is a mind
phenomenon; the heart lives in eternity. It knows the infinite so it can
wait, but it is very persistent. It will go on knocking. It is very soft
but it is very persistent – like water falling on a rock. Water is soft,
feminine, looks so weak, and if you think of it in comparison to the
rock, it is almost impotent. The rock is so powerful and looks so
potent, but finally one day the rock will disappear. The persistent
water falling on it, drop by drop, will destroy it: the rock will be
converted into sands and will be taken away and the water will still be
flowing. No rock has ever been able to destroy water.</p><p><br></p><p>But it takes time! So the heart is very soft – it is just like a
flower – but the way of the heart is the way of the water. The
watercourse way – that’s what Lao tzu calls it. And the mind is like a
rock: on the surface very strong, deep inside just bogus. The heart
ultimately wins over it.</p><p><br></p><p>It is happening – I can hear your heart and you will also hear it,
but you will have to wait a little. And don’t be in a hurry.</p><p><br></p><p>I can make you hear it but that will be violence. It can be done
immediately, right now it can be done, but that will be violence and
will not be good, will not be beautiful – can even be harmful.</p><p><br></p><p>So don’t think about that. Simply go, continue to meditate and
continue to remember me. Keep this with you (giving her a box) and
whenever you need me, just press it on the heart and remember me. Soon
you will start hearing the heart – before you come you will hear it.
Good!</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin is worried about her mother. She has always been
introverted and difficult to communicate with. She tells Osho that her
mother has been admitted twice to hospital with the diagnosis of
paranoid schizophrenia. The mother lives only in the past. ‘It has to do
with the church and with my father; her health is worsening.<span class=s4></span>’]</p><p><br></p><p>She can be brought out of her mind. Give her as much love as possible
when you go back; she needs that.</p><p><br></p><p>Mm mm, that’s what is needed. In fact it is love-deficiency that
people suffer from. Without love one starts feeling that one is
meaningless, useless, a burden. Without love there is no hope and no
future – one starts living in the past. Without love there is no
communication either. We can communicate only if we love. Without love
one starts feeling undernourished, one starts feeling unworthy, and the
whole world seems to be against one. One starts being resentful about
everything; one is simply complaining.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole attitude is that somehow life is wrong, everything is wrong
and nothing is right. Naturally, if that is the feeling then one starts
regressing inwards, starts becoming closed. Only love opens, only love
gives an opening.</p><p><br></p><p>So in fact what she needs is not therapy, what she needs is not
expertise. What she needs is simply pure human love, somebody who can
again give her hope... somebody who can make her feel worthy<span class=s4></span>somebody who can bring a little ray of light in her
life. That you can do, and it will be good</p><p>for your growth also. If you can help somebody to break through his
or her prison it will give you great insight for your own life, because
you can face the same problem some day; everybody can have the same
problem. If you have helped somebody to come out there are less
possibilities that you will have to face the same problem, and if you
do, you will be more capable of coping with it. You will be more capable
of understanding it and solving it on your own.</p><p><br></p><p>Only love brings one out of oneself. So go<span class=s4></span>and
don’t look at her as a patient, don’t look at her</p><p>as a mental case. She is not – in fact, nobody is. Mental cases exist
not; there is nobody who is mad. And all these words – schizophrenia and
neurosis and psychosis – are just efforts to label something which we
have not yet understood rightly. Out of one hundred cases, ninety-nine
are only deficiency cases, something is missing, and that something is
always love, more or less.</p><p><br></p><p>This society is so unloving. It gives great hopes in the beginning
and then it frustrates every hope. Every child comes bubbling with joy
and wants to celebrate, and by and by he finds that he is being
crippled, by and by he finds that there is no possibility to be joyous,
by and by he finds that the whole life is nothing but an
imprisonment.</p><p><br></p><p>Then all his joy disappears... he becomes stony and hard. Then he is
simply protecting himself – that’s all – not living. He is afraid of
everybody. Then you can call him paranoid.</p><p><br></p><p>Fear is because love is not, fear in itself is symptomatic: it simply
shows that love is not. Never take fear as a problem – it is not a
problem. It is just a hint from your system that love is needed,
urgently needed, desperately needed.</p><p><br></p><p>When you love you are completely fearless. When you are in love fear
exists not, you are at ease with existence. When you are not in love you
are alienated from existence, you fall apart, you are separate, you
don’t move with the whole. Then fear and trembling and death and
everything.</p><p><br></p><p>The society is very loveless, the world we have created is absolutely
loveless. It has no value for love: it has values for other things but
not for love. Love is a disvalue.</p><p><br></p><p>Your mother is suffering from it, and it almost always happens that
the people who are very sensitive suffer more than the insensitive
people. Insensitive people are thick, dense, mm? – they can tolerate
things – but the people who are sensitive are immediately paralysed
because of their sensitivity.</p><p><br></p><p>She must be a sensitive woman.</p><p><br></p><p>She wanted to really be in love... she wanted to be loved and she
wanted to love, and somehow that has not happened.</p><p><br></p><p>If she were thick she would have tolerated it, she would continue as
normal, but she broke her neck in it – she was sensitive. And now at the
age of fifty-five all hope has disappeared; life is almost finished.</p><p><br></p><p>So bring hope to her again. Go, and be very loving.</p><p><br></p><p>The first thing is not to communicate anything but just to be loving.
Hold hands, hug her, just sit by her side, listen to music, meditate,
and after a few days – seven, eight days of your loving – you will see
that she is opening, the bud is opening... and she will start
communicating.</p><p><br></p><p>When she starts communicating talk about meditations, about sannyas;
talk about what has happened to you, what is happening here. Play some
tapes to her, read some book to her and by and by, persuade her to
meditate.</p><p><br></p><p>If she can dance things will immediately change. Put on music, start
dancing. Dance is infectious: if you start dancing and doing Nataraj,
she will start feeling something. And if you feel that she is getting
ready for it, sometimes invite a few more sannyasins to your home; do a
meditation. Let her be just there... Let the meditative energy fall on
her.</p><p><br></p><p>My feeling is that she will be able to come out of it. Work is
needed, mm? and it can be done – try it!</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin says he has been on drugs for seven years and only
stopped taking them three months ago. Since then he has been feeling
really vulnerable and very insecure<span class=s4></span>]</p><p><br></p><p>This is good; to be vulnerable is good. To be vulnerable means to be
available – to be available to love, to be available to prayer, to be
available to god! Yes, insecurity is good. Security is dead. Life is
insecure, because life is always dancing with death – it has to be
insecure! Only death is secure. It never dances with life. Death is
separate, apart. Life is together with death. So if somebody tries too
much to become secure, he becomes that much more dead. It is in the same
proportion: death and security are in the same proportion. If you want
to be one hundred percent secure you have to be in your grave.</p><p><br></p><p>To be alive is to be in danger; anything can happen. The more alive
you are, the more danger there is. If you want to live one hundred
percent totally, you will have to live one hundred percent in danger, in
risk. That’s what is happening.<span class=s4></span>very good.</p><p><br></p><p>Those drugs were creating a dead wall around you.<span class=s4></span>drugs are deadening, mm? You are becoming</p><p>more sensitive – and fear will come, so don’t escape into your old
trick.</p><p><br></p><p>[The sannyasin says: I don’t feel like escaping into drugs
anymore<span class=s4></span>The groups really make me</p><p>feel good in the daytime but in the evening when the awareness goes,
my mind wants to escape with anything – a bottle of beer. Should I fight
that or should I drink one or two bottles of beer in the evening?]</p><p><br></p><p>Beer is nothing to be worried about, mm? Beer you can take, and there
is no need to fight with it because if you fight too much, then there is
again danger.</p><p><br></p><p>Beer is okay – that much can be continued right now, but by and by
slowly reduce it. From two bottles come to one, then to half. Then mix
water in with it, mm? Slowly reduce it – there is no need to be
drastic.</p><p><br></p><p>And then I will give you something. When you have come to drink just
water I will give you something. through magic you make the water, beer,
and drink it!</p><p><br></p><p>That miracle can be done – the water becomes wine and you can drink
it, mm? (chuckling) But don’t show the trick to anybody else, mm?</p><p>[A sannyasin said that he was unable to do any of the visualisation
exercises in the hypnotherapy group.]</p><p><br></p><p>You are an anti-poet – but there are such people<span class=s4></span>but they are good people – nothing to be worried</p><p>about, mm?</p><p><br></p><p>There are two types of people: people who are eye-centred; they can
visualise easily – and people who are ear-centred; they cannot visualise
easily. But the ear-centred people are more musical. They can listen to
sounds more easily, they can remember sound more easily than pictures;
pictures are difficult for them.</p><p><br></p><p>But the whole humanity is divided into two types. Plato, who was very
much against poets, must have been your type. In his ‘republic’ he said,
‘We will not allow any poets in the city, we will debar them. They are
not allowed to be in the city: they are destructive people, dreamy
people. They are not realistic enough.’</p><p><br></p><p>... Just accept it, there is nothing wrong in it, mm? your line will
be more through the ear.</p><p><br></p><p>And there is a problem because all the languages are dominated too
much by the eye-centred people. The ear-centred people have not
dominated the world – they are more feminine – and the reason is that
the ear is a feminine instrument. It simply receives, it cannot project.
The eye is more male: it projects. The ear cannot do anything: if I am
saying something the ear cannot do anything to it. The ear is just
receptive, a passivity, just a hole. The eye is very very active.</p><p><br></p><p>So the eye is male and the ear is female. Humanity has been
male-dominated and as a consequence the eye has dominated. That’s why in
all the languages we have words like ‘seer’. When somebody attains to
god we call him a ‘seer’. Why? – because the eye has dominated too
much.</p><p><br></p><p>You come here to visit me and it is called ‘darshan’: ‘darshan’ means
to see, not to hear. In India, philosophy is called darshan – the way to
see. In all the languages of the world the eye is too dominant.</p><p><br></p><p>There have been people who have reached to truth through the ear –
for example, Mohammed: he heard god. Old jewish prophets heard god. It
was a hearing, god talked to them; they heard his voice. They must have
been ear-oriented people... but such people have not dominated the
world; the ear is a repressed organ.</p><p><br></p><p>The eye-centred have dominated eighty percent; the ear-centred people
only twenty, so an ear- dominated person feels a little inadequate. He
starts feeling that he is in the minority, he starts feeling that
something is wrong in him. Nothing is wrong. You have to work through
the ear.</p><p><br></p><p>If you really want to visualise something you have to visualise
through the ear, not through the eye. For example, if you want to
remember me, rather than visualising my picture it will be easier for
you to visualise my sound. Just like a blind man.…</p><p><br></p><p>Once it happened that I was travelling in a train. I entered the
compartment in the middle of the night and in the compartment there was
only one man – a blind man. When I was paying the coolie, he heard me
and he immediately said ‘I recognise you!’</p><p><br></p><p>He said my name, and I said ‘But how did you know? I had completely
forgotten about you!’ He said ‘Ten years ago we met in Calcutta. I heard
your voice and I remembered.’ He was a singer, a blind singer. It is
usually very difficult after ten years but not for a blind man: his
memory is of sound.</p><p><br></p><p>So next time in deep hypnotherapy when the therapist tells you to
visualise, tell him ‘I am ear- oriented, so give me something to work
through the ear.’ That will do the same, mm? don’t use the eye, use the
ear, and you will go into it very deeply. Nothing to be worried
about.</p><p><br></p><p>[The sannyasin adds: Also a thing about that is that it resonates
through my whole body.]</p><p><br></p><p>Perfectly good! The eye-oriented people are very confined to the
head. The ear-oriented people are not so much confined to the head.
Sound vibrates the whole body, vision does not; it remains in the eye.
That’s why if somebody is singing you start vibrating. You start moving
your feet, you start tapping the chair... your whole body vibrates.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s good – nothing is wrong in it... in fact it is better! But I
understand – that whole hypnotherapy group is oriented for the eye
people. You will not find a single method in any hypnotherapy book which
is oriented to the ear people, mm? ‘Concentrate with the eyes’, ‘look
with the eyes’, ‘look at the light’, ‘look at the pendulum’ – but they
are all looking; they are not for the ear.</p><p><br></p><p>But I will tell [the leader of the hypnotherapy group], mm? because a
few people will come who are ear-oriented, so he has to work something
out for them. It will happen. Good!</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin who is leaving says: I’ve been feeling very cut off.
Feeling the impossibility of relating to people. It’s always been there,
but in Primal therapy it became very very strong.]</p><p><br></p><p>I wanted to talk about it to you sometime, but I was waiting for you
to ask; then I would talk about it. It happens to people who are too
intellectual – because all relationship is through the heart. There is
no relationship of the mind; there is nothing like intellectual
friendship, no.</p><p><br></p><p>To be related one needs to be a little foolish... and you are not. To
relate to people one needs to be non-serious, capable of having a sense
of humour, capable of being in fun and being funny, capable of being a
human being – which is to be a foolish being!</p><p><br></p><p>You look as if you are too much in the intellect: from there, there
is no relationship. Even if you relate with people you are talking from
the head. You don’t come down to the senses, you are not in your
senses.</p><p><br></p><p>So start being a little more foolish, enjoy foolishness a little bit
more. A wise man is always a foolish man; a wise man has the capacity to
move to the opposite pole also. A man who is simply wise and never
foolish is not really a wise man. So be a little more idiotic and you
will start feeling alive and that you are relating with people.</p><p><br></p><p>Somehow, too much intellect puts people off – they simply start
avoiding you, they withdraw, because intellect is very aggressive. And
people are not interested in intellect, and why should they be?</p><p><br></p><p>Intellect has not given anything: no joy, no celebration has ever
happened through intellect. Why should they be worried about it?
Intellectuals become by and by very alienated individuals. They start
living in a citadel, in their own world – worlds of concepts, theories,
philosophies. Then they relate with words; they don’t relate with real
people.</p><p><br></p><p>So if you want to relate with real people you will have to become a
real person. That’s why after primal you started seeing it more, because
primal pulls you down to the earth. Primal is a very very down-to-earth
method: it brings you back to your body. It brings you down from your
head to your navel, and only when you come to the navel does that scream
come, that releasing scream. Now, a scream is not an intellectual thing
– a scream is the most non-intellectual thing possible – but it releases
something; it makes you again a small child.</p><p><br></p><p>The insight is good, you are feeling the pain; that is good. Now do
something, because if you continue to feel pain too long, you will
become accustomed to it; you will become dulled to it.</p><p>... It is hard, but not impossible. It is hard – you just have to be
a little more alert and see how you destroy things: when you are talking
to somebody, holding somebody’s hand, how you destroy it. You have to be
watchful, and do something opposite – exactly the opposite of what you
have been doing up to now.</p><p>For a few days be more playful about new alternative. If somebody
asks you a question then watch what your reaction is, how you respond.
Is this the old response that you have always been giving? Change it
this time! Let it be something new. That is the whole methodology of
Zen.…</p><p>The master will ask a question and the disciple has to be very very
inventive, he has to immediately improvise. The master may have asked
the same question yesterday and the disciple answered it one way. He
asks it again today; if you answer the same way you are rejected.</p><p>Find out a new alternative, do something new! Just watch yourself:
whenever you are reacting, responding in the old, stereotype way,
structured way, drop it! Maybe you know everything about your old
response and there is every possibility that your response will be
adequate, but your whole life has become inadequate because of those
adequate responses.</p><p>This time try something inadequate, this time try something foolish.
And just watch: if you can be innovative at least twelve times every day
– and that is not a big thing – within two, three months you will see
that you have started changing; utter change will come to you.</p><p>You will enjoy new things so much, new ways so much. And in that very
enjoyment you will see that people have started coming to you, you have
started moving with people and there has arisen an affinity; you are
more en rapport with people. Sometimes a very small thing – just a good
laugh, sometimes just holding the hand of somebody and crying – can be a
great help, can be a great opening.</p><p>You have to come down from your head; you are stuck there. It is
going to be difficult – that’s right – but it is not impossible. And
even if it is difficult it has to be done. It is worth it. That
difficulty has to be taken on.</p><p>.… Meanwhile try new ways, do something new. Even if you prove
foolish – nothing to be worried about: be amateurish!</p><p>The second thing: listen to the other more. The greatest
communicators in the world are those who listen to the other more.</p><p>It happened once that a man came to me and he talked for at least
ninety minutes. I was staying in a friend’s house – the friend and his
wife were sitting there with us and they became bored. Mm? – they
disappeared into the house and then started feeling worried tor me
because the man was going on and on continuously. They were even more
worried because I was listening so attentively.</p><p>When the man finished his story, he looked at his watch and he said
‘It has been too long – I must go now – but I must say one thing’.… I
had not said a single word to him, mm? just yes or no, and that too just
to help his story go on. He said ‘You are a wonderful talker!’</p><p><br></p><p>I have always remembered it – that was a beautiful thing that he
said! He must have felt that way. And in those ninety minutes I had not
talked more than two minutes, three minutes at the most – just here and
there just to help – but he said ‘You are a wonderful talker. I will
come back.’ And he was so joyful.…</p><p><br></p><p>Start listening, help the other to talk. Don’t you try to communicate
– first help him to communicate with you. Then you will see that by and
by you have become very communicative... just as a side effect.</p><p><br></p><p>Be innovative, drop the old habits... and come back! Mm?</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part29>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

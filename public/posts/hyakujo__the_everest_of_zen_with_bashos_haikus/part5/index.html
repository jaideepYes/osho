ALL THOSE WORDS AND PHRASES ARE BASED ON SOMETHING PEOPLE ONCE HEARD – THEY ARE NOTHING BUT EMPTINESS. YOU, VENERABLE SIR, CLING TO THE MERE LETTER OF THE DOCTRINE, SO OF COURSE YOU TUMBLE ABOUT IN THE VOID.”\n“AND DO YOU ZEN MASTERS NOT TUMBLE IN THE VOID?” ASKED THE VINAYA MASTER. HYAKUJO SAID, “WE DO NOT.”\nTHE VINAYA MASTER RESPONDED “HOW NOT?”\nAT THIS, HYAKUJO SAID, “ALL THOSE WRITINGS ARE THE PRODUCTS OF WISDOM, AND WHERE WISDOM’S MIGHTY FUNCTION OPERATES, HOW CAN THERE BE TUMBLING ABOUT IN THE VOID?”\nManeesha, before I introduce Hyakujo’s sutras, and their meaning to me, I have to make you all understand that you must act intelligently.\nJust the other day, because I told Hasya not to unnecessarily struggle with dropping cigarettes – her whole life she has been smoking – many others who had already dropped, they immediately jumped! And many who had never smoked, they started smoking, perhaps thinking that this is a device towards buddhahood.\nYou are all buddhas, but don’t be idiot buddhas.\nToday the whole place is full of tobacco smell. I don’t want this place to be filled with tobacco smell. It has been so clean, and if you, many of you start smoking, you will bring the smell here. So those who have never smoked, simply stop. Those who have stopped and already were out of the withdrawal symptoms, should not start again.\nIt was specially meant for Hasya and Chitten, who have been going through withdrawal symptoms. When I entered yesterday and looked at Chitten, he was looking so sad, so dead. I wondered what was the matter, because I was not aware that he was also following Hasya. And when I said that Hasya can smoke, and there is no need to be worried... What does it matter if you live two years longer, or two years lesser? You will never know the difference. Nobody will know the difference, that Hasya lived two years less.\nSo except Chitten and Hasya, everybody has to come back. Use your own intelligence.\nWhen I told Hasya to smoke, Chitten had a great smile on his face. I wondered what was happening to him, because Hasya’s withdrawal symptoms cannot affect Chitten. Later on I came to know that he was on the same trip. Just hearing that he is free to smoke was enough to bring a great smile to him – he has not smoked yet, but all the withdrawal symptoms disappeared!\nDon’t be unnecessarily stupid. If necessary, it is okay, but unnecessarily stupid, that is a little too much!\nAnd remember, I should never smell tobacco in Buddha Hall. Even Hasya and Chitten, they can smoke wherever they want, but before coming to Buddha Hall they will change their clothes, take a shower and wash their mouths.\nThe cigarette is not a device for buddhahood. It is simply a kindness, not to unnecessarily harass you, but it is not for others to follow. They are already good, there is no need for them to start smoking. It is poison, it is destructive. It cannot destroy your buddhahood, but it shows your unintelligent habits. But if they have been formed a long time ago – for years – it is going to take too much time to throw them away. I will allow you to become a buddha smoking, but this is not the rule, this is only the exception.\nStill you will look a little foolish, when you become a buddha with your cigarettes. You yourself will think, “What am I doing? Being a buddha...”\nOne man used to come to me nearabout thirty years ago. He wanted somehow to drop his smoking habit.\nI said, “It is not difficult, it is simply a question of determination, a little will. What the cigarette is giving to you – a certain poison, nicotine – that keeps you feeling a certain well-being for a few minutes, meditation can do for twenty-four hours without any nicotine.”\nHe started meditating, he dropped the cigarettes – not with force. They dropped on their own as his meditation became deeper. Then he wanted to be initiated as a sannyasin.\nI said, “Have you thought it over?” He said, “I am absolutely ready.”\nHe took sannyas, and the next day he came saying, “You were right. I was going to the market with my wife, and people surrounded us. They started asking me questions: ‘With whose wife are you escaping?’ – because a sannyasin is not supposed to have a wife...”\nHe tried his best to say, “She is my wife!” But they said, “You are a sannyasin.”\nThe poor fellow was in a difficulty, so he mentioned my name.\nThen they said, “Then it is okay, because with Osho everything is okay. You can go, but it will be better that you get your wife also to become a sannyasin. Then it will be easier, otherwise some other crowd will beat you.”\nSo he brought his wife.\nI said, “She has no understanding. She has never thought about it, but it has now become necessary.”\nSo she became a sannyasin.\nThe third day they were traveling in the train. They had a small child, and people caught hold of them and stopped the train. They called the police saying, “These sannyasins are trying to escape with somebody’s child.”\nThey tried hard saying, “He is our child – ask him!”\nThey said, “You cannot deceive us this easily, you must have hypnotized him. That poor boy!”\nSo they were taken to the police station. The police officer had heard me, had read me. So he said, “Don’t be worried, I can understand. But the best way will be to let your son also be a sannyasin. Otherwise, anywhere you go you will be in trouble.”\nSo on the third day the child was introduced into sannyas. I said, “How many people are you around? Bring them all together – why harass me every day?”\nHe said, “I am not harassing, I am being harassed. You were right that I should think twice, but I did not think of all these problems, that people would be so angry.”\nSo the child also became a sannyasin.\nThey still come here. They live in Bombay, and some day you may see all the three.\nBefore you start smoking a cigarette, remember: it is going to create unhealthiness in you, in your lungs, and a shorter life. And most importantly, it is taking away your drive, your urgency towards meditation. You relax with your cigarette, then what is the need of the rest that Hyakujo talks about. The nicotine gives a little restfulness. There is no need for any meditation – just more and more cigarettes.\nI am not a man who is dogmatic in any way, but I will not put you in any discomfort. If you become sad and dull, and you start losing the joy of life, then it is okay, continue with the cigarettes. But remember, the responsibility is now greater on you to get into meditation. Only if in meditation you can get a deeper rest than nicotine can give you, will dropping cigarettes be easy.\nBut two fools are in trouble. Why are other idiots, who are almost out of the trouble, immediately jumping into it? Before withdrawal symptoms, you withdraw from the cigarettes. So anybody who has started, stop immediately. And anybody who has already stopped before, and has overcome the withdrawal symptoms, should not start again.\nAlways interpret whatever I say as my compassion and my love. I don’t want you to be in unnecessarily uncomfortable states. So if I make somebody an exception, it does not mean I am making a rule for everybody.\nAt least in Buddha Hall air, no smoke smell should be here. This you should take as a warning. If I smell tomorrow again the smell, I will immediately go back.\nNow the introductory note about Hyakujo:\nAS MENTIONED BEFORE, HYAKUJO WAS THE ORIGINATOR OF THE ZEN MONASTERY. THE DUTIES OF THE ABBOT AND OTHER OFFICERS WERE CAREFULLY DEFINED, AND THE LIVES OF THE MONKS REGULATED IN DETAIL.\nIN ADDITION, HYAKUJO ENCOURAGED HIS MONKS TO WORK IN THE FIELDS DURING THE DAY. THIS WAS QUITE A REVOLUTIONARY MOVE, AS BEFORE HYAKUJO’S TIME, MONKS WERE NOT SUPPOSED TO ENGAGE IN PRODUCTIVE WORK, BUT WERE ENTIRELY DEPENDENT ON GIFTS FROM PEOPLE BY WHICH TO LIVE.\nCertainly it was a great revolutionary move, to make sannyasins work in the fields, in the orchards, because for centuries they had not done anything. Society had taken the responsibility to take care of them, but there was a limit.\nThis situation happened in the time of Buddha, when India was one of the richest countries in the world. It was called The Golden Bird. It was not difficult for India, to provide all that was needed for a few thousand sannyasins. Joyfully, people did it. But as times changed, and the whole of the East had fallen into poverty, had been exploited by the West, sucked completely...\nIn Thailand, where one person is a sannyasin in every four persons, the burden has become too much. The Thailand government had to make a law that nobody can take sannyas without a government license. That is to prevent people from taking sannyas.\nThis seems to be very strange. You cannot even be a sannyasin without government permission. Even sannyas is not free anymore, but has become mandatory because a poor country and so many sannyasins... And now it is no longer a joy to contribute to their welfare, to their monasteries. They have become almost a heavy burden on the poor societies.\nThe same is the situation in India, but the Indian government has not taken any step, just because of the fear that if Hindu sannyasins have to take a license from the government, the whole of the Hindu society will go against the present-day rulers. In a vote they will be thrown out.\nHalf of India’s population is undernourished. One fourth of India’s population can manage only one meal a day, and if you see that meal, you will be simply shocked – what a meal! And all the predictions of scientific sources are that by the time of the year two thousand, India will have the biggest starvation problem that has ever happened in history. Fifty million people are predicted to die in that year. That means for every two persons, one person will die. All around there will be corpses.\nIn this situation of poverty you cannot afford sannyasins who are depending on social charity.\nHyakujo’s introduction of work and productivity was certainly a great revolutionary step. Society must have opposed him, and the monks must have opposed it because they were enjoying complete free time and all kinds of luxuries.\nBut Hyakujo was a very strong man. In his monastery he managed it that everybody worked. It did not mean that he was taking you away from meditation. The work was not very strict, but very flexible, depending on your intelligence – whatever you could contribute to the monastery. If you could work in the field, or chopping wood, or carrying water – whatever you could do. But the necessary thing was that everything should be done with a meditative mind.\nWork should be a meditation. Just as you sit for meditation, Buddha introduced walking also as meditation. Then why should working not also be associated with meditation. There is no reason. Only when work and all kinds of movements of your body, are followed by a meditative silence, can you really be a buddha. And certainly a buddha should not be dependent on charity.\nWe cannot understand how great the step was. For centuries monks have enjoyed a complete freedom from any activity, and all their welfare was taken care of by the society.\nSo Hyakujo’s introduction of work was a great step, and had a great clarity about the future as society was becoming more and more poor. Rather than governments making rules – it becomes so ugly, that you have to take a license from the government to become a sannyasin... Sannyas has always been an act of freedom and the government has nothing to do with it, but an intelligent move on the part of sannyasins is needed. Hyakujo has to be heard all over the world.\nNOT ONLY THAT, HYAKUJO WAS CRITICIZED BY ALL CONSERVATIVE BUDDHISTS AND MONKS FOR HIS INSISTENCE THAT ALL THAT THE CROPS YIELDED THROUGH THE LABOR OF HIS MONKS SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO THE ASSESSMENT OF TAXES ON AN EQUAL BASIS WITH THOSE OF LAY PEOPLE.\nThey were angry at the very idea of sannyasins working. And on top of it, Hyakujo insisted that the same tax system should be applicable to sannyasins’ work and earning as it was for anybody else in the country. Sannyasins should not be given a special place.\nNaturally he was tremendously opposed, but he was right. And when you oppose right, sooner or later the right wins over.\nNow in China every sannyasin works, in Japan... And the work has become so creative because it is no longer only an economic consideration. It is an aesthetic expression of your meditativeness, of your joy, of your blessings. Paintings, sculpture, all kinds of things became available by the idea that work and meditation are not opposed, but that meditation can continue underneath. That’s what I am saying to you every day: your buddha should continue underneath in every one of your activities.\nHYAKUJO’S FAVORITE MOTTO WAS: “ONE DAY WITHOUT WORKING, ONE DAY WITHOUT EATING.”\nIf you don’t work one day, then be prepared, next day is a fasting day. Absolutely right! You are working for your liberation. Why should anybody else be taxed for it? Why should anybody support you? You are working for your enlightenment. You will not be able to share it with anybody.\nSo it is absolutely necessary in Hyakujo’s monastery, that if you don’t work, you don’t eat. If you want to eat, then work just a little. That helps for your food, for your clothes and small necessities.\nYou don’t have to become the richest person in the world. You don’t have to accumulate all kinds of unnecessary luxuries, but be comfortable. In a state of uncomfortableness, meditation becomes difficult.\nHE SAW THAT WORSHIP AND MEDITATION COULD BE PART OF EVERYDAY WORK AND SEEMINGLY MUNDANE ACTIVITIES.\nIT IS SAID THAT THE GREAT PEARL WAS THE CREATOR OF THE CHINESE TEA CEREMONY.\nHyakujo himself was the creator of the Chinese tea ceremony. To make tea a meditative ceremony is just symbolic. It shows that any mundane activity can become meditative. Digging a hole in the garden, planting new roses in the garden... you can do it with such tremendous love and compassion, you can do it with the hands of the buddha. There is no contradiction.\nThe tea ceremony is only the beginning. I say unto you: Your every act should be a ceremony.\nIf you can bring your consciousness, your awareness, your intelligence to the act, if you can be spontaneous, then there is no need for any other religion, life itself will be the religion.\nNow the sutra:\nONCE, HYAKUJO WAS OUT IN THE FIELDS WORKING ALONGSIDE HIS DISCIPLES. JUST AS A CERTAIN MONK LIFTED UP HIS HOE, THE SOUND OF THE DINNER DRUM COULD BE HEARD.\nWITH THIS, THE MONK LAUGHED LOUDLY, DROPPED HIS HOE AND WENT TO THE TEMPLE.\n“WONDERFUL!” EXCLAIMED HYAKUJO. “THIS IS THE GATE TO THE ENTERING OF THE BODHISATTVA KANNON.” HYAKUJO FOLLOWED AFTER THE MONK, AND ARRIVING AT THE TEMPLE, ASKED THE MONK, “WHAT TRUTH DID YOU PERCEIVE WHEN YOU HEARD THE DINNER DRUM?”\nTHE MONK SAID, “JUST NOW I WAS TERRIBLY HUNGRY, AND WHEN I HEARD THE SOUND OF THE DRUM, I WENT BACK AND HAD MY MEAL.”\nON HEARING THIS, HYAKUJO HIMSELF LAUGHED.\nSimple things... the monk was so deeply engaged, so totally engaged in his work, that he had forgotten completely that it was time for lunch. And as the drum was beaten to call all the monks from the fields and the gardens, he laughed, throwing away his hoe.\nHyakujo asked him, “Why did you laugh?”\nA simple and honest answer: “I laughed at the coincidence. As the drum was beaten, suddenly I felt a great hunger. I laughed at the coincidence.”\nON HEARING THIS, HYAKUJO HIMSELF LAUGHED.\nHyakujo made Zen very light, very earthly, very honest, sincere.\nON ANOTHER OCCASION, ISAN, HEARING THE WOODEN GONG SOUNDING, RUBBED HIS HANDS AND GAVE A GREAT LAUGH.\nWHEN HYAKUJO SAW AND HEARD THIS, HE ASKED ISAN THE SAME QUESTION AS HE HAD ASKED THE OTHER MONK IN A SIMILAR SITUATION, AND RECEIVED A SIMILAR RESPONSE.\nIf you are silent and honest, the response cannot be different. Both have laughed at the coincidence. They were both so totally engaged in their work, they completely forgot themselves. And when you forget yourself, how can you remember your hunger? And when they heard the drum or the gong – a sudden hit and a spontaneous remembering: “I am hungry and this is the time to go to the dininghall.”\nBoth laughed. Hyakujo asked both just to see whether the similar situation would have a similar response from two honest, simple, meditative people.\nIn fact, all buddhas will respond similarly in a situation because of the simple fact that they are in the moment and their action is not through the mind, but instantaneous. They respond, they don’t react. And being empty-hearted, their responses will be just like a mirror – reflecting the situation, whatever is there in front of them.\nBecause both confronted hungriness, they laughed, “This is strange that we got lost so much in the work, that there was not even a sign of hunger. And just the gong... as if the gong created the hunger.”\nThe hunger was there but was waiting, because the consciousness was totally engaged somewhere else. The gong brought the consciousness to the waiting hunger. Hyakujo laughed, seeing the similarity of simple and empty-hearted people.\nAT ANOTHER TIME, A MASTER OF THE VINAYA SECT NAMED FA MING REMARKED, “YOU ZEN MASTERS DO A LOT OF TUMBLING ABOUT IN THE EMPTINESS OF THE VOID.”\nHYAKUJO REPLIED, “ON THE CONTRARY, VENERABLE SIR, IT IS YOU WHO TUMBLE A LOT IN THE EMPTINESS OF THE VOID.”\nTHE VINAYA MASTER ASKED, “HOW CAN THAT BE?”\n“THE SCRIPTURES,” CONTINUED HYAKUJO, “ARE JUST WORDS – MERE INK AND PAPER – AND EVERYTHING OF THAT SORT IS JUST AN EMPTY DEVICE. ALL THOSE WORDS AND PHRASES ARE BASED ON SOMETHING PEOPLE ONCE HEARD – THEY ARE NOTHING BUT EMPTINESS. YOU, VENERABLE SIR, CLING TO THE MERE LETTER OF THE DOCTRINE, SO OF COURSE YOU TUMBLE ABOUT IN THE VOID.”\nOrdinarily, the meditator is thought to be in the emptiness, in the ultimate void. But these forming teachers, who were only scholars of the vinaya scriptures of Gautam Buddha...\nThe master of the vinaya sect must have been very skeptical of Zen. It is his skepticism that said, “YOU ZEN MASTERS DO A LOT OF TUMBLING ABOUT IN THE EMPTINESS OF THE VOID.”\nScholars always think that meditators are wasting their time just sitting silently doing nothing. Scholars think they are doing great work creating great systems of thought and philosophy, and these meditators simply sit with their closed eyes. To the scholars, the meditators seem to be just lazy people who have found a good name, meditation, just to hide the laziness.\nSo his question was not sincere and honest, it was rather an effort to make a laughingstock of Hyakujo. But it was difficult – it is always difficult. A scholar is not even the dust underneath the feet of a meditator. He knows nothing of the heights of consciousness. Hyakujo did well, he did not felt offended.\n“ON THE CONTRARY, VENERABLE SIR, IT IS you WHO TUMBLE A LOT IN THE EMPTINESS OF THE VOID.”\nThis must have come as a shock to the vinaya master: “HOW CAN THAT BE?”\n“THE SCRIPTURES,” CONTINUED HYAKUJO, “ARE JUST WORDS – MERE INK AND PAPER – AND EVERYTHING OF THAT SORT IS JUST AN EMPTY DEVICE. ALL THOSE WORDS AND PHRASES ARE BASED ON SOMETHING PEOPLE ONCE HEARD – THEY ARE NOTHING BUT EMPTINESS. YOU, VENERABLE SIR, CLING TO THE MERE LETTER OF THE DOCTRINE, SO OF COURSE YOU TUMBLE ABOUT IN THE VOID.”\nFacing an enlightened man is a rare experience in the sense, that you cannot make a laughingstock of him.\nHe turned the whole thing on the scholar: “Rather than saying that we Zen people are tumbling in the emptiness and the void, calling it meditation... the truth is that you scholars are tumbling in the emptiness and void. What are your scriptures? Just paper and ink, mere words spoken by somebody, but those words are always empty. The moment they reach to the paper, to the ink, they don’t have life.\n“You are really tumbling into emptiness. We are not tumbling into emptiness, we are becoming emptiness, and that is a totally different thing. We are enjoying the emptiness, we are finding that emptiness is our nature, that out of this emptiness arises everything – our very life source.\n“AND DO YOU ZEN MASTERS NOT TUMBLE IN THE VOID?” ASKED THE VINAYA MASTER. HYAKUJO SAID, “WE DO NOT.”\nTHE VINAYA MASTER RESPONDED, “HOW NOT?”\nAT THIS, HYAKUJO SAID, “ALL THOSE WRITINGS ARE THE PRODUCTS OF WISDOM, AND WHERE WISDOM’S MIGHTY FUNCTION OPERATES, HOW CAN THERE BE TUMBLING ABOUT IN THE VOID?”\nA Zen meditator also reads the scriptures, but his reading cannot be called empty. He brings those words back again to life through his meditativeness, through his own wisdom. Someone has spoken those words out of wisdom, out of enlightenment – a buddha. Only another buddha can bring them to life again. Only another buddha can give meaning to them again.\nHyakujo says, “We are not tumbling into emptiness. Even if we are reading the ancient sutras, they are always secondary. We are simply testifying to our meditativeness, looking into the mirrors of the scriptures. For us, scriptures are a kind of reference source. Alone, inside, we don’t know whether we are on the right track or not. Reading about the same track in the scripture, functions in a double way. It makes the scripture alive, and it makes you confident to move along the same path you are doing.”\nBasho wrote a small haiku:\nYELLOW ROSE PETALS THUNDER –\nA WATERFALL.\nRemember always, a haiku is a painting in words. Silently Basho must have been meditating and when he opens his eyes saw “yellow rose petals, thunder – a waterfall.”\nJust the minimum words are used. Haikus are telegrams – not a single unnecessary word. You cannot add into this small haiku another word, nor can you take out a single word. It is exactly in a silent mind that opening the eyes and looking outside: rose petals and a great thunder and a waterfall.\nTry to understand haikus as paintings in words from great masters of meditation. That is the only way to understand them. Otherwise they are just empty words, unrelated, without any grammar and no care about the language. They don’t say anything. They simply show something: if you are meditating, and out of meditation you open your eyes, whatever you see becomes so beautiful, so poetic, so musical that Zen masters keep a copybook with them. They simply note down a few words.\nThose words actually represent what they have seen. They don’t elaborate, they don’t make a great poem out of them. These are simply notes of meditators about the beauty of existence of which the non-meditators are absolutely unaware.\nQuestion 1\nManeesha’s question:\nBELOVED OSHO,\nIT SEEMS THAT IF WE ARE EVEN TO BEGIN THE JOURNEY, WE NEED TO FEEL CONNECTED TO YOU. IF WE ARE TO persevere WE NEED TO love YOU. BUT ONCE WE HAVE SOMETHING WE CAN DEFINE AS A RELATIONSHIP WITH YOU, YOU WILL TELL US TO DROP IT.\nYOU POINT OUT THAT YOU ARE SIMPLY A REFLECTION AND A REMINDER OF OUR OWN INNER EMPTINESS; SO WE BEGIN TO EXPLORE THAT. WE ACTUALLY START ENJOYING, EVEN LOVING THAT SPACE. YOU EXPLAIN THAT THAT TOO HAS TO BE DROPPED.\nTHEN COMES THE FINAL BOMBSHELL: YOU TELL US THAT IN FACT WE HAVE TO BE DROPPED.\nAND THAT IS THE HARDEST THING.\nWHAT CAN ONE DO TO DISAPPEAR? CAN WE ONLY BE AWARE OF THE WAYS IN WHICH WE PERPETUATE OUR SELVES?\nManeesha, it is not the hardest thing. It is the most relaxed, and the easiest thing in the world. But it is the easiest thing only, for a man who has gone deep in witnessing.\nI have told you about a king, Prasenjita. It is a small story of great importance.…\nBuddha was staying outside the capital of Prasenjita, and Prasenjita was going to see the master, to present something to him. He tried to find what would be a suitable thing. He had one great diamond, of which many kings and emperors were jealous, because there was no comparison to that diamond. It was like pure water. Its quality was absolutely one hundred percent. He thought, “This will be the best thing to offer to Gautam Buddha’s feet.”\nHis wife was an older disciple of Buddha. Before she married the king, she was already under the influence and impact of Buddha.\nShe told her husband, “You think this beautiful and most valuable diamond will be the right present for Buddha? I don’t think so. To him it is just a stone, a dead stone. It will be more beautiful to give a lotus flower or a rose flower – something still alive, something of immense beauty and fragrance.”\nThe kind said, “Okay, I take the challenge. I will take both, and let us see what Buddha chooses.” So he took both – in one hand the diamond, in the other hand a beautiful lotus flower.\nFirst he offered the diamond. Buddha said, “Drop it!”\nNow, when Buddha says, “Drop it!” before ten thousand surrounding sannyasins, even Prasenjita could not manage... Reluctantly, he dropped it. It was such a valuable a thing.\nHe thought perhaps the wife was right, so he put forward his other hand in which the lotus flower was.\nBuddha said, “Drop it!”\nHe had not expected this situation, so he dropped the flower also.\nNow he was standing with empty hands, and Buddha said, “What are you waiting for? Drop it!”\nHe looked all around, because now there was nothing to drop.\nOne old sannyasin of Buddha, Sariputta, said to him, “He did not mean to drop the diamond or the lotus flower: He means to drop you. Drop yourself!”\nThat is the only offering you can bring to a buddha, neither diamonds nor flowers, but your utter egolessness.\nManeesha, it is not difficult.\nAnd secondly, don’t ask what you have to do to disappear. You don’t have to do anything. If you do something to disappear, you will remain the doer. You will get into a vicious circle. You are trying to disappear, so you have divided yourself in two parts: the one that you want to disappear into and the one that is trying to disappear. You will never succeed.\nIt is not in your hands to disappear. You simply search for the origin of your being, and you will find you have disappeared. It is a finding, not an effort, and hence it cannot be difficult. It can only be the easiest revolution, the greatest spontaneous rebellion. But it cannot be based on your effort.\nYou have to stop making efforts. You have just to be a witness. To be a witness is not an effort, because it is your nature. Do you think a mirror is trying continuously, twenty-four hours to remain a mirror? It is its nature.\nThis empty heart is your mirror. Just find it, and everything else that you always wanted will disappear – your anger, your ego, your very idea of personality. You will enter into a totally new dimension where you are the ocean, not the dewdrop.\nNow, it is Anando’s time.…\nPope the Polack feels a little strange, so he walks into Doctor Snuffit’s office and asks the doctor to give him a checkup.\nAfter a complete examination, Snuffit tells the papal Polack that he is suffering from “HAGS.” “HAGS!” cries Pope the Polack, in alarm. “What is HAGS?”\n“It is herpes, AIDS, gonorrhea and syphilis all combined,” replies Snuffit. “Holy Virgin Mary!” shrieks the pope. “Is there any cure for that?”\n“I don’t think so,” replies Snuffit, “but I am going to put you on a special diet, and put you in a special room for observation.”\n“What kind of special diet?” asks the Polack pope, trembling. “Pancakes and flatfish,” replies Snuffit.\n“That’s a bit weird,” says the Polack patient. “Why pancakes and flatfish?”\n“Well,” explains Snuffit, “they are the only things we can fit under the door!” There is a hell of an argument going on in the bar of the Howling Haggis Hotel.\nAt one end of the bar are sitting Paddy Murphy and Seamus O’Reilly. And standing at the other end of the bar are Hamish MacTavish and Sandy MacPherson.\n“I tell you,” shouts Paddy, “that Irish whiskey is the strongest stuff you will ever drink!” “That’s not true!” roars back Hamish MacTavish, pounding on the bar.\n“Everyone knows that Scotch whiskey is the real drink!”\nJust then, an American tourist and his wife come over to the bar from their table in the corner.\n“I want to tell you all,” says the American, “that I think that Irish whiskey is the real dynamite. Last week, my wife and I drank a whole bottle of Irish whiskey, got up the next morning and went to church for the early morning mass.”\n“What is so unusual about that?” asks Hamish, trying to be polite. “Lots of people drink a bottle of whiskey and get up the next day to go to church.”\n“Yes, I know,” says the American, “but we are Jewish!” Pussy Green comes to Father Fumble for her confession. “Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned,” mumbles Pussy. “How have you sinned?” asks Father Fumble.\n“Well,” continues Pussy, softly, “I have sinned with my boyfriend.”\nFumble presses his ear against the partition and says, “Speak up, my child. SPEAK LOUDER!” Pussy clears her throat and carries on.\n“Last night,” she says, “my boyfriend and I went to the pub, and afterwards I brought him home.” “Carry on, my child. Carry on,” urges Fumble, beginning to perspire.\n“We sat on the sofa,” says Pussy, “and he unbuttoned my blouse.” “And then?” says the priest, wiping the sweat from his hands.\n“Then he unhooked my bra,” continues Pussy, “and fondled my breasts.” “And then? And then?” gasps Fumble, removing his steamed-up spectacles.\n“Then he lifted up my skirt,” says Pussy, “and pulled down my panties.”\n“Then what? THEN WHAT?” cries the priest, digging his fingernails into the wooden partition. “Then he pulled out his prick,” says Pussy, “and climbed on top of me.”\n“And then?” sobs Fumble, “AND THEN?”\n“And then,” says Pussy, “my mother walked in.” “Ah!” screams the priest. “Shit!”\nAnando... (Drumbeat) (Gibberish) (Drumbeat) Nivedano...\nBe silent, close your eyes. Feel your body to be completely frozen.\nNow look inwards with absolute urgency as if this is the last moment of your life.\nBring your total consciousness as an arrow, moving towards the center of your being. It is not a long journey from the circumference to the center.\nJust a little deeper, and you will be entering the very source of your being. The realization of this is called the buddha.\nFirst you have to realize the buddha in your whole life – in your actions, in your inactions. But this is not the last step, it is just the last but one.\nI want you to take a jump from this stepping board into the ultimate oceanic reality. Unless you disappear completely, leaving no trace behind, you cannot be at rest.\nThe buddha is only the door.\nTo make it more clear, Nivedano... (Drumbeat)\nRelax. Let go of the body and the mind. Only the witnessing remains, which is another name of buddhahood.\nRejoice this great moment.\nVery few people have reached to their own center, even in millions of lives. Hence I say you are fortunate.\nThis evening is blessed.\nThis place is holy. Where ten thousand buddhas are just melting in their consciousness into each other – it has become a lake of consciousness, without any ripples.\nGather as much life juice, collect all the wild flowers, before you return back.\nSlowly, slowly your circumference and center will come closer. And one day, suddenly, the circumference will disappear and only the center will remain. That will be your realization of the buddha. One step more beyond that, and your center also disappears.\nThis nothingness beyond the center is not empty, it is the greatest benediction; it makes you the whole universe.\nNivedano... (Drumbeat)\nCome back, all the buddhas, carrying as much experience. Sit down, and recollect the space you have been in.\nEvery day, inch by inch, you have to grow into a buddha. Okay, Maneesha?\nYes, Osho.\nCan we celebrate the ten thousand buddhas? Yes, Osho!\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"5858","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/hyakujo__the_everest_of_zen_with_bashos_haikus/part5/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/hyakujo__the_everest_of_zen_with_bashos_haikus/>Hyakujo - The Everest of Zen, with Basho\'s Haikus</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">5 Don\'t be idiot buddhas</h1><div class=post-meta>28 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;5858 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Hyakujo__The_Everest_of_Zen_with_Bashos_Haikus/part5.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part4>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

JUST AS A CERTAIN MONK LIFTED UP HIS HOE, THE SOUND OF THE DINNER DRUM
COULD BE HEARD.</p><p><br></p><p>WITH THIS, THE MONK LAUGHED LOUDLY, DROPPED HIS HOE AND WENT TO THE
TEMPLE.</p><p><br></p><p>“WONDERFUL!” EXCLAIMED HYAKUJO. “THIS IS THE GATE TO THE ENTERING OF
THE BODHISATTVA KANNON.”</p><p><br></p><p>HYAKUJO FOLLOWED AFTER THE MONK, AND ARRIVING AT THE TEMPLE, ASKED
THE MONK, “WHAT TRUTH DID YOU PERCEIVE WHEN YOU HEARD THE DINNER
DRUM?”</p><p><br></p><p>THE MONK SAID, “JUST NOW I WAS TERRIBLY HUNGRY, AND WHEN I HEARD THE
SOUND OF THE DRUM, I WENT BACK AND HAD MY MEAL.”</p><p><br></p><p>ON HEARING THIS, HYAKUJO HIMSELF LAUGHED.</p><p><br></p><p>ON ANOTHER OCCASION, ISAN, HEARING THE WOODEN GONG SOUNDING, RUBBED
HIS HANDS AND GAVE A GREAT LAUGH.</p><p><br></p><p>WHEN HYAKUJO SAW AND HEARD THIS, HE ASKED ISAN THE SAME QUESTION AS
HE HAD ASKED THE OTHER MONK IN A SIMILAR SITUATION, AND RECEIVED A
SIMILAR RESPONSE.</p><p>AT ANOTHER TIME, A MASTER OF THE VINAYA SECT NAMED FA MING REMARKED,
“YOU ZEN MASTERS DO A LOT OF TUMBLING ABOUT IN THE EMPTINESS OF THE
VOID.”</p><p><br></p><p>HYAKUJO REPLIED, “ON THE CONTRARY, VENERABLE SIR, IT IS YOU WHO
TUMBLE A LOT IN THE EMPTINESS OF THE VOID.”</p><p><br></p><p>THE VINAYA MASTER ASKED, “HOW CAN THAT BE?”</p><p><br></p><p>“THE SCRIPTURES,” CONTINUED HYAKUJO, “ARE JUST WORDS – MERE INK AND
PAPER – AND EVERYTHING OF THAT SORT IS JUST AN EMPTY DEVICE. ALL THOSE
WORDS AND PHRASES ARE BASED ON SOMETHING PEOPLE ONCE HEARD – THEY ARE
NOTHING BUT EMPTINESS. YOU, VENERABLE SIR, CLING TO THE MERE LETTER OF
THE DOCTRINE, SO OF COURSE YOU TUMBLE ABOUT IN THE VOID.”</p><p><br></p><p>“AND DO YOU ZEN MASTERS NOT TUMBLE IN THE VOID?” ASKED THE VINAYA
MASTER. HYAKUJO SAID, “WE DO NOT.”</p><p>THE VINAYA MASTER RESPONDED “HOW NOT?”</p><p><br></p><p>AT THIS, HYAKUJO SAID, “ALL THOSE WRITINGS ARE THE PRODUCTS OF
WISDOM, AND WHERE WISDOM’S MIGHTY FUNCTION OPERATES, HOW CAN THERE BE
TUMBLING ABOUT IN THE VOID?”</p><p><br></p><p>Maneesha, before I introduce Hyakujo’s sutras, and their meaning to
me, I have to make you all understand that you must act
intelligently.</p><p><br></p><p>Just the other day, because I told Hasya not to unnecessarily
struggle with dropping cigarettes – her whole life she has been smoking
– many others who had already dropped, they immediately jumped! And many
who had never smoked, they started smoking, perhaps thinking that this
is a device towards buddhahood.</p><p><br></p><p>You are all buddhas, but don’t be idiot buddhas.</p><p><br></p><p>Today the whole place is full of tobacco smell. I don’t want this
place to be filled with tobacco smell. It has been so clean, and if you,
many of you start smoking, you will bring the smell here. So those who
have never smoked, simply stop. Those who have stopped and already were
out of the withdrawal symptoms, should not start again.</p><p><br></p><p>It was specially meant for Hasya and Chitten, who have been going
through withdrawal symptoms. When I entered yesterday and looked at
Chitten, he was looking so sad, so dead. I wondered what was the matter,
because I was not aware that he was also following Hasya. And when I
said that Hasya can smoke, and there is no need to be worried... What
does it matter if you live two years longer, or two years lesser? You
will never know the difference. Nobody will know the difference, that
Hasya lived two years less.</p><p><br></p><p>So except Chitten and Hasya, everybody has to come back. Use your own
intelligence.</p><p>When I told Hasya to smoke, Chitten had a great smile on his face. I
wondered what was happening to him, because Hasya’s withdrawal symptoms
cannot affect Chitten. Later on I came to know that he was on the same
trip. Just hearing that he is free to smoke was enough to bring a great
smile to him – he has not smoked yet, but all the withdrawal symptoms
disappeared!</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t be unnecessarily stupid. If necessary, it is okay, but
unnecessarily stupid, that is a little too much!</p><p><br></p><p>And remember, I should never smell tobacco in Buddha Hall. Even Hasya
and Chitten, they can smoke wherever they want, but before coming to
Buddha Hall they will change their clothes, take a shower and wash their
mouths.</p><p><br></p><p>The cigarette is not a device for buddhahood. It is simply a
kindness, not to unnecessarily harass you, but it is not for others to
follow. They are already good, there is no need for them to start
smoking. It is poison, it is destructive. It cannot destroy your
buddhahood, but it shows your unintelligent habits. But if they have
been formed a long time ago – for years – it is going to take too much
time to throw them away. I will allow you to become a buddha smoking,
but this is not the rule, this is only the exception.</p><p><br></p><p>Still you will look a little foolish, when you become a buddha with
your cigarettes. You yourself will think, “What am I doing? Being a
buddha...”</p><p><br></p><p>One man used to come to me nearabout thirty years ago. He wanted
somehow to drop his smoking habit.</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “It is not difficult, it is simply a question of
determination, a little will. What the cigarette is giving to you – a
certain poison, nicotine – that keeps you feeling a certain well-being
for a few minutes, meditation can do for twenty-four hours without any
nicotine.”</p><p><br></p><p>He started meditating, he dropped the cigarettes – not with force.
They dropped on their own as his meditation became deeper. Then he
wanted to be initiated as a sannyasin.</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Have you thought it over?” He said, “I am absolutely
ready.”</p><p>He took sannyas, and the next day he came saying, “You were right. I
was going to the market with my wife, and people surrounded us. They
started asking me questions: ‘With whose wife are you escaping?’ –
because a sannyasin is not supposed to have a wife...”</p><p><br></p><p>He tried his best to say, “She is my wife!” But they said, “You are a
sannyasin.”</p><p>The poor fellow was in a difficulty, so he mentioned my name.</p><p><br></p><p>Then they said, “Then it is okay, because with Osho everything is
okay. You can go, but it will be better that you get your wife also to
become a sannyasin. Then it will be easier, otherwise some other crowd
will beat you.”</p><p>So he brought his wife.</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “She has no understanding. She has never thought about it,
but it has now become necessary.”</p><p><br></p><p>So she became a sannyasin.</p><p><br></p><p>The third day they were traveling in the train. They had a small
child, and people caught hold of them and stopped the train. They called
the police saying, “These sannyasins are trying to escape with
somebody’s child.”</p><p><br></p><p>They tried hard saying, “He is our child – ask him!”</p><p><br></p><p>They said, “You cannot deceive us this easily, you must have
hypnotized him. That poor boy!”</p><p><br></p><p>So they were taken to the police station. The police officer had
heard me, had read me. So he said, “Don’t be worried, I can understand.
But the best way will be to let your son also be a sannyasin. Otherwise,
anywhere you go you will be in trouble.”</p><p><br></p><p>So on the third day the child was introduced into sannyas. I said,
“How many people are you around? Bring them all together – why harass me
every day?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I am not harassing, I am being harassed. You were right
that I should think twice, but I did not think of all these problems,
that people would be so angry.”</p><p><br></p><p>So the child also became a sannyasin.</p><p><br></p><p>They still come here. They live in Bombay, and some day you may see
all the three.</p><p><br></p><p>Before you start smoking a cigarette, remember: it is going to create
unhealthiness in you, in your lungs, and a shorter life. And most
importantly, it is taking away your drive, your urgency towards
meditation. You relax with your cigarette, then what is the need of the
rest that Hyakujo talks about. The nicotine gives a little restfulness.
There is no need for any meditation – just more and more cigarettes.</p><p><br></p><p>I am not a man who is dogmatic in any way, but I will not put you in
any discomfort. If you become sad and dull, and you start losing the joy
of life, then it is okay, continue with the cigarettes. But remember,
the responsibility is now greater on you to get into meditation. Only if
in meditation you can get a deeper rest than nicotine can give you, will
dropping cigarettes be easy.</p><p><br></p><p>But two fools are in trouble. Why are other idiots, who are almost
out of the trouble, immediately jumping into it? Before withdrawal
symptoms, you withdraw from the cigarettes. So anybody who has started,
stop immediately. And anybody who has already stopped before, and has
overcome the withdrawal symptoms, should not start again.</p><p><br></p><p>Always interpret whatever I say as my compassion and my love. I don’t
want you to be in unnecessarily uncomfortable states. So if I make
somebody an exception, it does not mean I am making a rule for
everybody.</p><p>At least in Buddha Hall air, no smoke smell should be here. This you
should take as a warning. If I smell tomorrow again the smell, I will
immediately go back.</p><p><br></p><p>Now the introductory note about Hyakujo:</p><p><br></p><p>AS MENTIONED BEFORE, HYAKUJO WAS THE ORIGINATOR OF THE ZEN MONASTERY.
THE DUTIES OF THE ABBOT AND OTHER OFFICERS WERE CAREFULLY DEFINED, AND
THE LIVES OF THE MONKS REGULATED IN DETAIL.</p><p><br></p><p>IN ADDITION, HYAKUJO ENCOURAGED HIS MONKS TO WORK IN THE FIELDS
DURING THE DAY. THIS WAS QUITE A REVOLUTIONARY MOVE, AS BEFORE HYAKUJO’S
TIME, MONKS WERE NOT SUPPOSED TO ENGAGE IN PRODUCTIVE WORK, BUT WERE
ENTIRELY DEPENDENT ON GIFTS FROM PEOPLE BY WHICH TO LIVE.</p><p><br></p><p>Certainly it was a great revolutionary move, to make sannyasins work
in the fields, in the orchards, because for centuries they had not done
anything. Society had taken the responsibility to take care of them, but
there was a limit.</p><p><br></p><p>This situation happened in the time of Buddha, when India was one of
the richest countries in the world. It was called The Golden Bird. It
was not difficult for India, to provide all that was needed for a few
thousand sannyasins. Joyfully, people did it. But as times changed, and
the whole of the East had fallen into poverty, had been exploited by the
West, sucked completely...</p><p><br></p><p>In Thailand, where one person is a sannyasin in every four persons,
the burden has become too much. The Thailand government had to make a
law that nobody can take sannyas without a government license. That is
to prevent people from taking sannyas.</p><p><br></p><p>This seems to be very strange. You cannot even be a sannyasin without
government permission. Even sannyas is not free anymore, but has become
mandatory because a poor country and so many sannyasins... And now it is
no longer a joy to contribute to their welfare, to their monasteries.
They have become almost a heavy burden on the poor societies.</p><p><br></p><p>The same is the situation in India, but the Indian government has not
taken any step, just because of the fear that if Hindu sannyasins have
to take a license from the government, the whole of the Hindu society
will go against the present-day rulers. In a vote they will be thrown
out.</p><p><br></p><p>Half of India’s population is undernourished. One fourth of India’s
population can manage only one meal a day, and if you see that meal, you
will be simply shocked – what a meal! And all the predictions of
scientific sources are that by the time of the year two thousand, India
will have the biggest starvation problem that has ever happened in
history. Fifty million people are predicted to die in that year. That
means for every two persons, one person will die. All around there will
be corpses.</p><p><br></p><p>In this situation of poverty you cannot afford sannyasins who are
depending on social charity.</p><p><br></p><p>Hyakujo’s introduction of work and productivity was certainly a great
revolutionary step. Society must have opposed him, and the monks must
have opposed it because they were enjoying complete free time and all
kinds of luxuries.</p><p>But Hyakujo was a very strong man. In his monastery he managed it
that everybody worked. It did not mean that he was taking you away from
meditation. The work was not very strict, but very flexible, depending
on your intelligence – whatever you could contribute to the monastery.
If you could work in the field, or chopping wood, or carrying water –
whatever you could do. But the necessary thing was that everything
should be done with a meditative mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Work should be a meditation. Just as you sit for meditation, Buddha
introduced walking also as meditation. Then why should working not also
be associated with meditation. There is no reason. Only when work and
all kinds of movements of your body, are followed by a meditative
silence, can you really be a buddha. And certainly a buddha should not
be dependent on charity.</p><p><br></p><p>We cannot understand how great the step was. For centuries monks have
enjoyed a complete freedom from any activity, and all their welfare was
taken care of by the society.</p><p><br></p><p>So Hyakujo’s introduction of work was a great step, and had a great
clarity about the future as society was becoming more and more poor.
Rather than governments making rules – it becomes so ugly, that you have
to take a license from the government to become a sannyasin... Sannyas
has always been an act of freedom and the government has nothing to do
with it, but an intelligent move on the part of sannyasins is needed.
Hyakujo has to be heard all over the world.</p><p><br></p><p>NOT ONLY THAT, HYAKUJO WAS CRITICIZED BY ALL CONSERVATIVE BUDDHISTS
AND MONKS FOR HIS INSISTENCE THAT ALL THAT THE CROPS YIELDED THROUGH THE
LABOR OF HIS MONKS SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO THE ASSESSMENT OF TAXES ON AN
EQUAL BASIS WITH THOSE OF LAY PEOPLE.</p><p><br></p><p>They were angry at the very idea of sannyasins working. And on top of
it, Hyakujo insisted that the same tax system should be applicable to
sannyasins’ work and earning as it was for anybody else in the country.
Sannyasins should not be given a special place.</p><p><br></p><p>Naturally he was tremendously opposed, but he was right. And when you
oppose right, sooner or later the right wins over.</p><p><br></p><p>Now in China every sannyasin works, in Japan... And the work has
become so creative because it is no longer only an economic
consideration. It is an aesthetic expression of your meditativeness, of
your joy, of your blessings. Paintings, sculpture, all kinds of things
became available by the idea that work and meditation are not opposed,
but that meditation can continue underneath. That’s what I am saying to
you every day: your buddha should continue underneath in every one of
your activities.</p><p><br></p><p>HYAKUJO’S FAVORITE MOTTO WAS: “ONE DAY WITHOUT WORKING, ONE DAY
WITHOUT EATING.”</p><p><br></p><p>If you don’t work one day, then be prepared, next day is a fasting
day. Absolutely right! You are working for your liberation. Why should
anybody else be taxed for it? Why should anybody support you? You are
working for your enlightenment. You will not be able to share it with
anybody.</p><p><br></p><p>So it is absolutely necessary in Hyakujo’s monastery, that if you
don’t work, you don’t eat. If you want to eat, then work just a little.
That helps for your food, for your clothes and small necessities.</p><p>You don’t have to become the richest person in the world. You don’t
have to accumulate all kinds of unnecessary luxuries, but be
comfortable. In a state of uncomfortableness, meditation becomes
difficult.</p><p><br></p><p>HE SAW THAT WORSHIP AND MEDITATION COULD BE PART OF EVERYDAY WORK AND
SEEMINGLY MUNDANE ACTIVITIES.</p><p><br></p><p>IT IS SAID THAT THE GREAT PEARL WAS THE CREATOR OF THE CHINESE TEA
CEREMONY.</p><p><br></p><p>Hyakujo himself was the creator of the Chinese tea ceremony. To make
tea a meditative ceremony is just symbolic. It shows that any mundane
activity can become meditative. Digging a hole in the garden, planting
new roses in the garden... you can do it with such tremendous love and
compassion, you can do it with the hands of the buddha. There is no
contradiction.</p><p><br></p><p>The tea ceremony is only the beginning. I say unto you: Your every
act should be a ceremony.</p><p><br></p><p>If you can bring your consciousness, your awareness, your
intelligence to the act, if you can be spontaneous, then there is no
need for any other religion, life itself will be the religion.</p><p><br></p><p>Now the sutra:</p><p><br></p><p>ONCE, HYAKUJO WAS OUT IN THE FIELDS WORKING ALONGSIDE HIS DISCIPLES.
JUST AS A CERTAIN MONK LIFTED UP HIS HOE, THE SOUND OF THE DINNER DRUM
COULD BE HEARD.</p><p><br></p><p>WITH THIS, THE MONK LAUGHED LOUDLY, DROPPED HIS HOE AND WENT TO THE
TEMPLE.</p><p><br></p><p>“WONDERFUL!” EXCLAIMED HYAKUJO. “THIS IS THE GATE TO THE ENTERING OF
THE BODHISATTVA KANNON.” HYAKUJO FOLLOWED AFTER THE MONK, AND ARRIVING
AT THE TEMPLE, ASKED THE MONK, “WHAT TRUTH DID YOU PERCEIVE WHEN YOU
HEARD THE DINNER DRUM?”</p><p><br></p><p>THE MONK SAID, “JUST NOW I WAS TERRIBLY HUNGRY, AND WHEN I HEARD THE
SOUND OF THE DRUM, I WENT BACK AND HAD MY MEAL.”</p><p><br></p><p>ON HEARING THIS, HYAKUJO HIMSELF LAUGHED.</p><p><br></p><p>Simple things... the monk was so deeply engaged, so totally engaged
in his work, that he had forgotten completely that it was time for
lunch. And as the drum was beaten to call all the monks from the fields
and the gardens, he laughed, throwing away his hoe.</p><p><br></p><p>Hyakujo asked him, “Why did you laugh?”</p><p><br></p><p>A simple and honest answer: “I laughed at the coincidence. As the
drum was beaten, suddenly I felt a great hunger. I laughed at the
coincidence.”</p><p><br></p><p>ON HEARING THIS, HYAKUJO HIMSELF LAUGHED.</p><p>Hyakujo made Zen very light, very earthly, very honest, sincere.</p><p><br></p><p>ON ANOTHER OCCASION, ISAN, HEARING THE WOODEN GONG SOUNDING, RUBBED
HIS HANDS AND GAVE A GREAT LAUGH.</p><p><br></p><p>WHEN HYAKUJO SAW AND HEARD THIS, HE ASKED ISAN THE SAME QUESTION AS
HE HAD ASKED THE OTHER MONK IN A SIMILAR SITUATION, AND RECEIVED A
SIMILAR RESPONSE.</p><p><br></p><p>If you are silent and honest, the response cannot be different. Both
have laughed at the coincidence. They were both so totally engaged in
their work, they completely forgot themselves. And when you forget
yourself, how can you remember your hunger? And when they heard the drum
or the gong – a sudden hit and a spontaneous remembering: “I am hungry
and this is the time to go to the dininghall.”</p><p><br></p><p>Both laughed. Hyakujo asked both just to see whether the similar
situation would have a similar response from two honest, simple,
meditative people.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, all buddhas will respond similarly in a situation because of
the simple fact that they are in the moment and their action is not
through the mind, but instantaneous. They respond, they don’t react. And
being empty-hearted, their responses will be just like a mirror –
reflecting the situation, whatever is there in front of them.</p><p><br></p><p>Because both confronted hungriness, they laughed, “This is strange
that we got lost so much in the work, that there was not even a sign of
hunger. And just the gong... as if the gong created the hunger.”</p><p><br></p><p>The hunger was there but was waiting, because the consciousness was
totally engaged somewhere else. The gong brought the consciousness to
the waiting hunger. Hyakujo laughed, seeing the similarity of simple and
empty-hearted people.</p><p><br></p><p>AT ANOTHER TIME, A MASTER OF THE VINAYA SECT NAMED FA MING REMARKED,
“YOU ZEN MASTERS DO A LOT OF TUMBLING ABOUT IN THE EMPTINESS OF THE
VOID.”</p><p><br></p><p>HYAKUJO REPLIED, “ON THE CONTRARY, VENERABLE SIR, IT IS YOU WHO
TUMBLE A LOT IN THE EMPTINESS OF THE VOID.”</p><p><br></p><p>THE VINAYA MASTER ASKED, “HOW CAN THAT BE?”</p><p><br></p><p>“THE SCRIPTURES,” CONTINUED HYAKUJO, “ARE JUST WORDS – MERE INK AND
PAPER – AND EVERYTHING OF THAT SORT IS JUST AN EMPTY DEVICE. ALL THOSE
WORDS AND PHRASES ARE BASED ON SOMETHING PEOPLE ONCE HEARD – THEY ARE
NOTHING BUT EMPTINESS. YOU, VENERABLE SIR, CLING TO THE MERE LETTER OF
THE DOCTRINE, SO OF COURSE YOU TUMBLE ABOUT IN THE VOID.”</p><p><br></p><p>Ordinarily, the meditator is thought to be in the emptiness, in the
ultimate void. But these forming teachers, who were only scholars of the
vinaya scriptures of Gautam Buddha...</p><p>The master of the vinaya sect must have been very skeptical of Zen.
It is his skepticism that said, “YOU ZEN MASTERS DO A LOT OF TUMBLING
ABOUT IN THE EMPTINESS OF THE VOID.”</p><p><br></p><p>Scholars always think that meditators are wasting their time just
sitting silently doing nothing. Scholars think they are doing great work
creating great systems of thought and philosophy, and these meditators
simply sit with their closed eyes. To the scholars, the meditators seem
to be just lazy people who have found a good name, meditation, just to
hide the laziness.</p><p><br></p><p>So his question was not sincere and honest, it was rather an effort
to make a laughingstock of Hyakujo. But it was difficult – it is always
difficult. A scholar is not even the dust underneath the feet of a
meditator. He knows nothing of the heights of consciousness. Hyakujo did
well, he did not felt offended.</p><p><br></p><p>“ON THE CONTRARY, VENERABLE SIR, IT IS you WHO TUMBLE A LOT IN THE
EMPTINESS OF THE VOID.”</p><p><br></p><p>This must have come as a shock to the vinaya master: “HOW CAN THAT
BE?”</p><p><br></p><p>“THE SCRIPTURES,” CONTINUED HYAKUJO, “ARE JUST WORDS – MERE INK AND
PAPER – AND EVERYTHING OF THAT SORT IS JUST AN EMPTY DEVICE. ALL THOSE
WORDS AND PHRASES ARE BASED ON SOMETHING PEOPLE ONCE HEARD – THEY ARE
NOTHING BUT EMPTINESS. YOU, VENERABLE SIR, CLING TO THE MERE LETTER OF
THE DOCTRINE, SO OF COURSE YOU TUMBLE ABOUT IN THE VOID.”</p><p><br></p><p>Facing an enlightened man is a rare experience in the sense, that you
cannot make a laughingstock of him.</p><p><br></p><p>He turned the whole thing on the scholar: “Rather than saying that we
Zen people are tumbling in the emptiness and the void, calling it
meditation... the truth is that you scholars are tumbling in the
emptiness and void. What are your scriptures? Just paper and ink, mere
words spoken by somebody, but those words are always empty. The moment
they reach to the paper, to the ink, they don’t have life.</p><p><br></p><p>“You are really tumbling into emptiness. We are not tumbling into
emptiness, we are becoming emptiness, and that is a totally different
thing. We are enjoying the emptiness, we are finding that emptiness is
our nature, that out of this emptiness arises everything – our very life
source.</p><p><br></p><p>“AND DO YOU ZEN MASTERS NOT TUMBLE IN THE VOID?” ASKED THE VINAYA
MASTER. HYAKUJO SAID, “WE DO NOT.”</p><p>THE VINAYA MASTER RESPONDED, “HOW NOT?”</p><p><br></p><p>AT THIS, HYAKUJO SAID, “ALL THOSE WRITINGS ARE THE PRODUCTS OF
WISDOM, AND WHERE WISDOM’S MIGHTY FUNCTION OPERATES, HOW CAN THERE BE
TUMBLING ABOUT IN THE VOID?”</p><p>A Zen meditator also reads the scriptures, but his reading cannot be
called empty. He brings those words back again to life through his
meditativeness, through his own wisdom. Someone has spoken those words
out of wisdom, out of enlightenment – a buddha. Only another buddha can
bring them to life again. Only another buddha can give meaning to them
again.</p><p><br></p><p>Hyakujo says, “We are not tumbling into emptiness. Even if we are
reading the ancient sutras, they are always secondary. We are simply
testifying to our meditativeness, looking into the mirrors of the
scriptures. For us, scriptures are a kind of reference source. Alone,
inside, we don’t know whether we are on the right track or not. Reading
about the same track in the scripture, functions in a double way. It
makes the scripture alive, and it makes you confident to move along the
same path you are doing.”</p><p><br></p><p>Basho wrote a small haiku:</p><p><br></p><p>YELLOW ROSE PETALS THUNDER –</p><p>A WATERFALL.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember always, a haiku is a painting in words. Silently Basho must
have been meditating and when he opens his eyes saw “yellow rose petals,
thunder – a waterfall.”</p><p><br></p><p>Just the minimum words are used. Haikus are telegrams – not a single
unnecessary word. You cannot add into this small haiku another word, nor
can you take out a single word. It is exactly in a silent mind that
opening the eyes and looking outside: rose petals and a great thunder
and a waterfall.</p><p><br></p><p>Try to understand haikus as paintings in words from great masters of
meditation. That is the only way to understand them. Otherwise they are
just empty words, unrelated, without any grammar and no care about the
language. They don’t say anything. They simply show something: if you
are meditating, and out of meditation you open your eyes, whatever you
see becomes so beautiful, so poetic, so musical that Zen masters keep a
copybook with them. They simply note down a few words.</p><p><br></p><p>Those words actually represent what they have seen. They don’t
elaborate, they don’t make a great poem out of them. These are simply
notes of meditators about the beauty of existence of which the
non-meditators are absolutely unaware.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 1</p><p><br></p><p>Maneesha’s question:</p><p><br></p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>IT SEEMS THAT IF WE ARE EVEN TO BEGIN THE JOURNEY, WE NEED TO FEEL
CONNECTED TO YOU. IF WE ARE TO persevere WE NEED TO love YOU. BUT ONCE
WE HAVE SOMETHING WE CAN DEFINE AS A RELATIONSHIP WITH YOU, YOU WILL
TELL US TO DROP IT.</p><p>YOU POINT OUT THAT YOU ARE SIMPLY A REFLECTION AND A REMINDER OF OUR
OWN INNER EMPTINESS; SO WE BEGIN TO EXPLORE THAT. WE ACTUALLY START
ENJOYING, EVEN LOVING THAT SPACE. YOU EXPLAIN THAT THAT TOO HAS TO BE
DROPPED.</p><p><br></p><p>THEN COMES THE FINAL BOMBSHELL: YOU TELL US THAT IN FACT WE HAVE TO
BE DROPPED.</p><p><br></p><p>AND THAT IS THE HARDEST THING.</p><p><br></p><p>WHAT CAN ONE DO TO DISAPPEAR? CAN WE ONLY BE AWARE OF THE WAYS IN
WHICH WE PERPETUATE OUR SELVES?</p><p><br></p><p>Maneesha, it is not the hardest thing. It is the most relaxed, and
the easiest thing in the world. But it is the easiest thing only, for a
man who has gone deep in witnessing.</p><p><br></p><p>I have told you about a king, Prasenjita. It is a small story of
great importance.…</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha was staying outside the capital of Prasenjita, and Prasenjita
was going to see the master, to present something to him. He tried to
find what would be a suitable thing. He had one great diamond, of which
many kings and emperors were jealous, because there was no comparison to
that diamond. It was like pure water. Its quality was absolutely one
hundred percent. He thought, “This will be the best thing to offer to
Gautam Buddha’s feet.”</p><p><br></p><p>His wife was an older disciple of Buddha. Before she married the
king, she was already under the influence and impact of Buddha.</p><p><br></p><p>She told her husband, “You think this beautiful and most valuable
diamond will be the right present for Buddha? I don’t think so. To him
it is just a stone, a dead stone. It will be more beautiful to give a
lotus flower or a rose flower – something still alive, something of
immense beauty and fragrance.”</p><p><br></p><p>The kind said, “Okay, I take the challenge. I will take both, and let
us see what Buddha chooses.” So he took both – in one hand the diamond,
in the other hand a beautiful lotus flower.</p><p>First he offered the diamond. Buddha said, “Drop it!”</p><p><br></p><p>Now, when Buddha says, “Drop it!” before ten thousand surrounding
sannyasins, even Prasenjita could not manage... Reluctantly, he dropped
it. It was such a valuable a thing.</p><p><br></p><p>He thought perhaps the wife was right, so he put forward his other
hand in which the lotus flower was.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha said, “Drop it!”</p><p><br></p><p>He had not expected this situation, so he dropped the flower
also.</p><p><br></p><p>Now he was standing with empty hands, and Buddha said, “What are you
waiting for? Drop it!”</p><p>He looked all around, because now there was nothing to drop.</p><p><br></p><p>One old sannyasin of Buddha, Sariputta, said to him, “He did not mean
to drop the diamond or the lotus flower: He means to drop you. Drop
yourself!”</p><p><br></p><p>That is the only offering you can bring to a buddha, neither diamonds
nor flowers, but your utter egolessness.</p><p><br></p><p>Maneesha, it is not difficult.</p><p><br></p><p>And secondly, don’t ask what you have to do to disappear. You don’t
have to do anything. If you do something to disappear, you will remain
the doer. You will get into a vicious circle. You are trying to
disappear, so you have divided yourself in two parts: the one that you
want to disappear into and the one that is trying to disappear. You will
never succeed.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not in your hands to disappear. You simply search for the
origin of your being, and you will find you have disappeared. It is a
finding, not an effort, and hence it cannot be difficult. It can only be
the easiest revolution, the greatest spontaneous rebellion. But it
cannot be based on your effort.</p><p><br></p><p>You have to stop making efforts. You have just to be a witness. To be
a witness is not an effort, because it is your nature. Do you think a
mirror is trying continuously, twenty-four hours to remain a mirror? It
is its nature.</p><p><br></p><p>This empty heart is your mirror. Just find it, and everything else
that you always wanted will disappear – your anger, your ego, your very
idea of personality. You will enter into a totally new dimension where
you are the ocean, not the dewdrop.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, it is Anando’s time.…</p><p><br></p><p>Pope the Polack feels a little strange, so he walks into Doctor
Snuffit’s office and asks the doctor to give him a checkup.</p><p><br></p><p>After a complete examination, Snuffit tells the papal Polack that he
is suffering from “HAGS.” “HAGS!” cries Pope the Polack, in alarm. “What
is HAGS?”</p><p>“It is herpes, AIDS, gonorrhea and syphilis all combined,” replies
Snuffit. “Holy Virgin Mary!” shrieks the pope. “Is there any cure for
that?”</p><p>“I don’t think so,” replies Snuffit, “but I am going to put you on a
special diet, and put you in a special room for observation.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What kind of special diet?” asks the Polack pope, trembling.
“Pancakes and flatfish,” replies Snuffit.</p><p>“That’s a bit weird,” says the Polack patient. “Why pancakes and
flatfish?”</p><p>“Well,” explains Snuffit, “they are the only things we can fit under
the door!” There is a hell of an argument going on in the bar of the
Howling Haggis Hotel.</p><p>At one end of the bar are sitting Paddy Murphy and Seamus O’Reilly.
And standing at the other end of the bar are Hamish MacTavish and Sandy
MacPherson.</p><p><br></p><p>“I tell you,” shouts Paddy, “that Irish whiskey is the strongest
stuff you will ever drink!” “That’s not true!” roars back Hamish
MacTavish, pounding on the bar.</p><p>“Everyone knows that Scotch whiskey is the real drink!”</p><p><br></p><p>Just then, an American tourist and his wife come over to the bar from
their table in the corner.</p><p><br></p><p>“I want to tell you all,” says the American, “that I think that Irish
whiskey is the real dynamite. Last week, my wife and I drank a whole
bottle of Irish whiskey, got up the next morning and went to church for
the early morning mass.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What is so unusual about that?” asks Hamish, trying to be polite.
“Lots of people drink a bottle of whiskey and get up the next day to go
to church.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, I know,” says the American, “but we are Jewish!” Pussy Green
comes to Father Fumble for her confession. “Forgive me, Father, for I
have sinned,” mumbles Pussy. “How have you sinned?” asks Father
Fumble.</p><p>“Well,” continues Pussy, softly, “I have sinned with my
boyfriend.”</p><p><br></p><p>Fumble presses his ear against the partition and says, “Speak up, my
child. SPEAK LOUDER!” Pussy clears her throat and carries on.</p><p>“Last night,” she says, “my boyfriend and I went to the pub, and
afterwards I brought him home.” “Carry on, my child. Carry on,” urges
Fumble, beginning to perspire.</p><p>“We sat on the sofa,” says Pussy, “and he unbuttoned my blouse.” “And
then?” says the priest, wiping the sweat from his hands.</p><p>“Then he unhooked my bra,” continues Pussy, “and fondled my breasts.”
“And then? And then?” gasps Fumble, removing his steamed-up
spectacles.</p><p>“Then he lifted up my skirt,” says Pussy, “and pulled down my
panties.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then what? THEN WHAT?” cries the priest, digging his fingernails
into the wooden partition. “Then he pulled out his prick,” says Pussy,
“and climbed on top of me.”</p><p>“And then?” sobs Fumble, “AND THEN?”</p><p><br></p><p>“And then,” says Pussy, “my mother walked in.” “Ah!” screams the
priest. “Shit!”</p><p>Anando... (Drumbeat) (Gibberish) (Drumbeat) Nivedano...</p><p>Be silent, close your eyes. Feel your body to be completely
frozen.</p><p><br></p><p>Now look inwards with absolute urgency as if this is the last moment
of your life.</p><p><br></p><p>Bring your total consciousness as an arrow, moving towards the center
of your being. It is not a long journey from the circumference to the
center.</p><p><br></p><p>Just a little deeper, and you will be entering the very source of
your being. The realization of this is called the buddha.</p><p><br></p><p>First you have to realize the buddha in your whole life – in your
actions, in your inactions. But this is not the last step, it is just
the last but one.</p><p><br></p><p>I want you to take a jump from this stepping board into the ultimate
oceanic reality. Unless you disappear completely, leaving no trace
behind, you cannot be at rest.</p><p><br></p><p>The buddha is only the door.</p><p><br></p><p>To make it more clear, Nivedano... (Drumbeat)</p><p>Relax. Let go of the body and the mind. Only the witnessing remains,
which is another name of buddhahood.</p><p><br></p><p>Rejoice this great moment.</p><p>Very few people have reached to their own center, even in millions of
lives. Hence I say you are fortunate.</p><p><br></p><p>This evening is blessed.</p><p><br></p><p>This place is holy. Where ten thousand buddhas are just melting in
their consciousness into each other – it has become a lake of
consciousness, without any ripples.</p><p><br></p><p>Gather as much life juice, collect all the wild flowers, before you
return back.</p><p><br></p><p>Slowly, slowly your circumference and center will come closer. And
one day, suddenly, the circumference will disappear and only the center
will remain. That will be your realization of the buddha. One step more
beyond that, and your center also disappears.</p><p><br></p><p>This nothingness beyond the center is not empty, it is the greatest
benediction; it makes you the whole universe.</p><p><br></p><p>Nivedano... (Drumbeat)</p><p>Come back, all the buddhas, carrying as much experience. Sit down,
and recollect the space you have been in.</p><p><br></p><p>Every day, inch by inch, you have to grow into a buddha. Okay,
Maneesha?</p><p>Yes, Osho.</p><p><br></p><p>Can we celebrate the ten thousand buddhas? Yes, Osho!</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part4>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

EVEN IF YOU DON’T BECOME ENLIGHTENED, WHEN YOU SIT ONCE IN MEDITATION, YOU ARE A BUDDHA FOR THAT SITTING; WHEN YOU SIT FOR A DAY IN MEDITATION, YOU ARE A BUDDHA FOR A DAY; WHEN YOU SIT IN MEDITATION ALL YOUR LIFE, YOU ARE A BUDDHA ALL YOUR LIFE. THE SAME IS TRUE OF THE FUTURE; ONE WHO CAN HAVE FAITH IN THIS IS SOMEONE WITH GREAT POTENTIAL.\nPRACTICING EVERYTHING WITHOUT ANY SENSE OF ATTAINMENT IS CALLED THE EXCEEDINGLY PROFOUND TRANSCENDENT WISDOM. THIS WISDOM CAN CUT OFF THE SOURCE OF BIRTH AND DEATH, LIKE A SHARP SWORD.\nTO PRACTICE VIRTUE IN HOPES OF REWARD IS THE ILLUSION OF ORDINARY FOLK; BODHISATTVAS DO NOT SEEK FOR THE RESULTING REWARDS AS THEY CULTIVATE ROOTS OF VIRTUE, BECAUSE THEY CULTIVATE GOODNESS FOR THE SAKE OF IMPARTIAL LOVE AND COMPASSION, AND THUS IT BECOMES SUSTENANCE FOR ENLIGHTENMENT. AS FOR THOSE WHO SEEK REWARDS AS THEY CULTIVATE VIRTUE AND ATTAIN THE LESSER REWARD OF HUMANITY OR GOD-HOOD, THIS IS SURELY THE WORK OF BIRTH AND DEATH.\nENLIGHTENMENT IS THE WAY TO EXTINCTION. IF YOU TAKE PEACE AND QUIET TO BE BLISS, ALL THINGS ARE AFFLICTIONS; BUT WHEN YOU ARE ENLIGHTENED, ALL THINGS ARE ENLIGHTENMENT. PEOPLE OF THE WORLD DO NOT UNDERSTAND THIS BASIS OF DELUSION AND ENLIGHTENMENT. THEY SUPPRESS THOUGHTS OF BIRTH AND DEATH, AND THINK THAT THIS IS THE NON-BIRTH OF A SINGLE THOUGHT, AND ALSO CONSIDER THIS MINDLESSNESS – BUT THESE ARE STILL THOUGHTS OF BIRTH AND DEATH, NOT MINDLESSNESS, NOT QUIESCENCE. WHEN YOU TRY TO STOP THOUGHT BY THOUGHT, BIRTH AND DEATH CONTINUE.\nManeesha, the whole question for Zen is how not to discriminate. Mind is discrimination, division, duality. The effort of Zen is to bring you to a space where you are simply a watcher, without any judgment. At the moment you are simply a watcher, all that is false disappears on its own accord and all that is real shines forth in its absolute illumination.\nThis is your home. In this space there is no mind; hence no desire, no jealousy, no anger, no hate. You have become just a mirror. You reflect the tremendous glory and splendor of the whole existence. For the first time you have gone beyond human conditionings. You have become universal.\nObviously, in this moment, in this space, there is no darkness. And remember clearly: darkness and light are two aspects of the same coin. When darkness disappears, light also disappears. What is left is tremendously new, you have not even dreamed of it.\nIn this clarity, in this silence, the whole existence seems to be exactly what it is, not what it is “supposed to be.” Your enlightenment becomes, suddenly, the enlightenment of the whole universe.\nThis is one of the most important points that Daikaku is making. And there is a second important point which he is making, which is very rare. Perhaps nobody else has ever made this statement before, but it is absolutely true. While you are in meditation, in silence – even for a single moment – you are a buddha. You can come out, and you can again forget.\nYou can sit in meditation for one hour, or if meditation becomes your undercurrent of consciousness, you can remain a buddha for twenty-four hours. In other words, whenever you are aware and silent and whenever you feel the whole existence to be enlightened, you are a buddha. You can forget it – it is your freedom to forget or to remember.\nA very rare genius, Daikaku, makes this statement: “Ordinary masters will not enter into the lion’s den.” It is a very strange statement, with no precedent. But I can say to you, it is true: every day you become a buddha. I see you coming back from your home, resurrecting. You are a totally different man – so silent, so peaceful, so fragrant, such a beauty to see.\nBut I know you will forget. Forgetfulness has been your habit for millions of years. So this one moment of buddhahood will become a beautiful memory, and then the forgetfulness comes like a flood of old habit and the whole moon disappears behind the black clouds. But the moon is there; we will discover it again. There is no harm in discovering your buddhahood again and again.\nOne can hope, one can trust that one day these old habits will become weakened and your whole buddhahood will become a simple matter, just like breathing.\nBut nobody except Daikaku has made the point – that even for a single moment, if you are silent and push aside all your thoughts and habits, clearing the space of the mind which has been occupying it for centuries... even though it may only remain for a single moment, you are a buddha. Perhaps you will have to remember again and again till the old habits start dying out. They will die because they don’t have any roots. Unless you support and nourish them, they cannot exist.\nIt is a strange story that man supports his misery, nourishes it, takes care that it does not leave him, because it is his only companion. People magnify their miseries, if they cannot magnify anything else.\nIn the university where I was a professor, a woman was also a professor. Her husband was a very prominent advocate of the High Court. Because I used to pass by where they lived, coming from the university or going to the university, the woman was always waiting there for a lift. The husband saw it once or twice and the third time he came to see me in the university and he told me, “I am worried about you.”\nI said, “What is the matter?”\nHe said, “You are giving my wife a lift every day. Don’t believe her – she is such a hypochondriac. Just a small cough and immediately she says, ‘I am suffering from tuberculosis.’ Don’t listen to what she says! It is her habit to enjoy her misery. She paints it as deeply as possible, she is almost a creative artist – suffering and suffering.”\nI said, “You don’t have to tell me. I enjoy her and I am not worried about her tuberculosis. She is not an exception, she is the rule.”\nEverybody is trying to magnify his sufferings, his miseries. It is a very sad condition that rather than jumping out of this vicious circle, you go on weaving around yourself more and more of the same stuff. But there is a very deep pay-off in it: it brings sympathy to you. It is not for no reason at all that people magnify their misery. It simply shows that they have not received love.\nI told the husband, “You think that your wife is wrong. I want to say to you that you have not loved her enough. Seeking shelter in misery comes only when nobody loves you; you can always fall upon your misery as an old friend. When you are miserable everybody is sympathetic to you, when you are not miserable nobody cares about you.”\nThe whole psychology is upside-down. People should pay attention to others when they are looking radiant, joyful, blissful. That will be giving nourishment, because attention is nourishment. Never give attention to misery, because you are nourishing the misery. You are forcing the person to remain miserable because sympathy is so sweet – but it is a sweet poison. It is not, and cannot be, a substitute for the joy of love.\nBut people settle at the minimum. If love is not coming their way and they don’t know how to get it, immediately the alternative seems to be misery. Then people pay attention to you. So I told the husband, “Just try to be a little more loving.”\nHe said, “My God, I hate to go home, and you are telling me to be loving to that woman? As I enter the house she starts her tirade of imaginable and unimaginable illnesses. And she goes on reading\nmedical encyclopedias, finding out what kind of misery would be good. She knows great names. In the beginning she used to freak me out, that ‘My God, I have never heard of this disease!’ And she would give the whole description of what was happening. Only later on I found the encyclopedia and the exact description, and she had marked it. At first I used to take it seriously and take her to the doctor. And every doctor said, ‘This misery has just been discovered. This disease is only just in the periodicals; only experts know about it. Your wife is a real genius! Even ordinary practitioners, physicians, doctors, will not understand what kind of disease she is talking about!’”\nHe said, “I remain in the court as long as I can, then in the court library. And then I go to the bar, because I can tolerate that woman only when I am drunk. I wanted to warn you because you are giving her a lift every day – you may end up in my situation!”\nI said, “Don’t be worried. I never sympathize, I simply enjoy. She talks as you are saying and I encourage her to talk more, because I love such details. And she looks at me with very weird eyes: ‘... A strange fellow. I am suffering from cancer, I say to you!’”\nI told her, “Suffer! Just tell me the details – I love it. You know so much about cancer. Obviously, you must be suffering, even cancer experts may not be able to defeat you, but please give me all the details. I love it so much!”\nIn three days I stopped her. She would sit completely silently, keeping her face looking out of the window. And I would go on poking her: “Please tell me something. You are so great, you are carrying such a burden of the whole world. You are almost an encyclopedia of medicine.”\nShe stopped asking for a lift. I had to go inside their house and ask her husband, “Where is she? – because I enjoy her so much.” She was such a nice woman, so knowledgeable! And I am absolutely ignorant about these great diseases. It was just a great teaching on the way – for one hour coming, one hour going; for two hours every day I would become an expert!\nI have been in touch with thousands of people – they have all been victims of a wrong psychology. Their parents have paid attention to them when they were sick. Nobody bothers about a child when he is not sick. This is a very dangerous phenomenon: you are forcing the child to be sick because you are giving attention, and attention is a subtle food.\nI had a gardener, an authentic gardener, who really loved flowers, who loved the plants. And I would see him sitting by the side of the roses and other flowers. Sometimes I heard him talking to the flowers. At first I thought he looked a little crazy, but every year he was winning the first prize in the city for growing the biggest flowers. He was with me for almost twelve years.\nI asked him, “What is your secret?”\nHe said, “Nothing, I am just a little crazy. When there is nobody around, I talk to the flowers: ‘Don’t let me down this time. The time for the exhibition is coming close – grow as big as you can.’ And I have been winning for twenty years continuously. No flower has ever let me down.”\nJust the attention, just a loving attention to a flower, makes him immensely happy. There is someone who will be happy: the flower will do everything for him to make him happy. There is someone who is watching and waiting for his growth; he is not alone, he is not unneeded.\nThis whole world looks so miserable for the simple reason that we have chosen to give attention to the wrong things, things which should be taken care of but without any sympathy.\nYou can love somebody, but please don’t love her headaches. Just make sure that she goes and gets some Greek aspirin. More than that is destroying the person. But when she is laughing, enjoy her, don’t even ask the question, why is she laughing? When she is dancing, dance with her; don’t ask, “What is the occasion?”\nPay attention to the right things and you will see a transformation happening in the person. You can help not only yourself in discovering your buddha, you can also help everybody else who is in contact with you. If you give right attention, right nourishment to his hidden treasure, to his hidden splendor, you can help buddhahood to be spread like a wildfire.\nAnd we need it! We have always needed it, but we need it more than ever now. We need a silent, peaceful, loving, at-ease and relaxed humanity. Enough of all those Genghis Khans and Tamerlanes and Nadir Shahs and Adolf Hitlers and Stalins and Mussolinis. If educationists of the world are a little aware, they should simply drop these people from the history books; there is no need to give attention to them. It is the same thing. You give too much attention to these terrible barbarians... you provoke the same barbarians around you, and somebody else starts becoming a Nadir Shah or a Tamerlane.\nJust drop all that nonsense, that garbage. Why not talk about the buddhas? Why not talk about the beautiful painters? Why not talk about the great dancers, the musicians, all kinds of artists? Let people’s minds be filled with creativity, and it will be very easy for a creative person to find the buddha. The destructive person has gone too far away; to bring him back to his buddhahood is very difficult.\nI am reminded of Alexander the Great, who is one of the most terrible specimens of all those barbarians. While coming out of Greece, on the boundaries, he met one of the most beautiful men. No history book bothers about that beautiful man, and so many pages are wasted on Alexander.\nHe met Diogenes.\nDiogenes lived naked; the climate was good, his health was good. All that he possessed was a lamp. He used to keep it lit even in the daytime. Alexander had heard many stories about Diogenes. But by chance, while he was moving, somebody told him that Diogenes was just nearby, living by the side of a river. So Alexander stopped his army and he said, “I will have to see the man. I have been thinking to see him but he was so far away; I cannot miss this opportunity.”\nSo he went to see Diogenes. Diogenes was having a sunbath by the side of the river, on the sand in the early morning sun – a cool breeze, birds singing all around, his lamp by his side. Alexander had seen many beautiful women, many beautiful men, but nothing could be compared with the beauty, the radiance of this naked fakir. He could not believe his eyes that a man could be such pure gold that he need not be hidden behind clothes.\nWhat is of importance, in reference to Daikaku, is the question that Diogenes asked Alexander: “Where are you going? – because I hear armies going by my side, day and night, thousands of soldiers. Where are you going?”\nAlexander said, “I want to conquer the world.”\nDiogenes said, “That’s good. What will you do after that?” Nobody had ever asked that. For a moment there was silence. Alexander said, “After that I will relax.”\nDiogenes said, “You must be stupid, because I am relaxing already without conquering the whole world. If you want to relax afterward, why take the trouble? Why not relax now? This river bank is big enough – we can both share it. Just throw your clothes away and lie down. And we can even share the lamp.”\nAlexander said, “Logically you are right.” He understood logic because he was a student of Aristotle, the father of Western logic.\nHe said, “I can understand the logic. It looks stupid after taking so much trouble to kill and massacre, and then afterwards just to relax. Why not relax now? You are right. But I have gone too far. It is just a question of a few months more and my conquest of the world will be over. Otherwise, even relaxing by your side, I will go on remembering that it was only a question of a few months more. I will not be able to relax. I can relax only after I conquer the whole world.”\nDiogenes said, “It is up to you. I was even ready to share my riverside. I was even ready to share my lamp, my only property.”\nAlexander was continuously watching the lamp. In the day? – what was the point of keeping the lamp burning?\nHe asked, “Forgive me, I have no right to ask, but why do you carry this lamp even in the full daylight? The sunlight is there, and you go on carrying this lamp, naked.”\nDiogenes said, “I am searching for an authentic man. Who knows at what time he will meet me? I want to see his face, the original face. This lamp is just symbolic.”\nIt is said that when Diogenes was dying, somebody from the crowd asked, “What happened to your great search for the original man?”\nHe said, “I could not find him. But this much I must say in favor of humanity: that my lamp has not been stolen, it is still with me. More than that I cannot say.”\nHistory should teach more about these people. And there have been thousands around the world; they will provoke a longing in the people’s minds.\nJust today Shunyo was telling me that Anando is compiling a book on all the saints that I have spoken on. She has already found three hundred names. She was puzzled; she said, “I never could imagine that there have been three hundred buddhas.”\nI said to her, “This is just a sample. Humanity is kept completely unaware of their greatest masterpieces, of their real original people who are the very salt of the earth.”\nThe natural effect is that everybody goes on becoming more miserable. Every generation is more miserable than the previous one.\nI have been hearing from California that even six-year-old children have been found, in thousands, to be taking drugs. A six-year-old child taking drugs? An eight-year-old child murdering? A nine- year-old child trying to rape a girl...? But when you emphasize so much murder, drugs and rape on the television, you are teaching these things. All these governments and all these corporations are emphasizing the wrong kind of people on their television and radio, not knowing at all that they are creating an urge in millions of viewers to imitate them. These crimes should not even be mentioned.\nPay attention to the right, to the beautiful, and you will be nourishing it.\nSo your work is not only to be a buddha, your work is also to help others who are asleep, by throwing a little cold water in their eyes! In the beginning they will be irritated. Everybody is irritated with me. It is not acceptable to disturb somebody’s sleep; and a sleep which has lasted for centuries... to disturb it, you are certainly a nuisance. But I want you to be a nuisance. As your own experience deepens, don’t be worried, spread it, even to those who are annoyed; it does not matter. Perhaps just being annoyed may take them out of their nightmares.\nDAIKAKU SAID:\nTHIS TEACHING IS THE SCHOOL OF THE ENLIGHTENED MIND. THE ENLIGHTENED MIND ITSELF BASICALLY HAS NO DELUSION OR ENLIGHTENMENT.\nEvery statement has to be listened to very carefully. He is saying the enlightened Mind has neither mind nor enlightenment; it is simply a pure consciousness. Don’t cling to enlightenment either: that clinging shows that you have destroyed the enlightenment, reduced it into some kind of thing – respectability, reputation. It is none of these.\nEnlightenment is so silent a joy... it does not even make ripples in the lake, it just reflects the moon. It is so silent, just like the bamboo shadows sweeping the temple steps. No sound, no footsteps.\nTHE ENLIGHTENED MIND ITSELF BASICALLY HAS NO DELUSION OR ENLIGHTENMENT.\nThere have been thousands of enlightened people who have said that the enlightened Mind has no delusion, but they have forgotten to add that it has no enlightenment either. It is just like a disease: you have a disease, you carry a medicine with you. The disease is cured – do you still think to carry the medicine? You just donate it to the Lions Club!\nSo when you become enlightened just donate it to the Lions Club! Perhaps somebody may need it. But don’t carry it with you; otherwise enlightenment itself becomes a new imprisonment. Do you see the immense significance of his statement? This actually is the subtle art of those who realize thusness.\nEVEN IF YOU DON’T BECOME ENLIGHTENED, WHEN YOU SIT ONCE IN MEDITATION, YOU ARE A BUDDHA FOR THAT SITTING.\nSo when I say to you after your meditation that now we should celebrate the ten thousand buddhas, I am not joking. I am making a certain point again and again to you that you may forget after a few minutes, and rush to a party somewhere in a hotel! Buddhas are not supposed to do that! But times have changed – modern buddhas always do that. After having a good experience they celebrate it in many ways. And where to go to celebrate, to have a real Italian party?\nNothing is wrong in it if you go on remembering that you are a buddha. Nothing is wrong in the world if your remembrance remains there in the background.\nHe is making a really great statement, never before made.\nWHEN YOU SIT ONCE IN MEDITATION, YOU ARE A BUDDHA FOR THAT SITTING... at least; WHEN YOU SIT FOR A DAY IN MEDITATION, YOU ARE A BUDDHA FOR A DAY; WHEN YOU SIT IN MEDITATION ALL YOUR LIFE, YOU ARE A BUDDHA ALL YOUR LIFE. THE SAME IS TRUE OF THE FUTURE; ONE WHO CAN HAVE FAITH IN THIS IS SOMEONE WITH GREAT POTENTIAL.\nSitting in meditation should be understood clearly: you cannot sit twenty-four hours in meditation, but you can be twenty-four hours in meditation. That is what is called ‘sitting in meditation’. Don’t take it literally. It does not mean that you have to sit twenty-four hours in meditation. It simply means that whatever you do, do with the remembrance, with the same silence and the same benediction, with the same grace and the same ecstasy.\nWhatever you are doing, it does not matter: carrying water from the well, chopping wood, anything. But just do it with your buddha alive within you, conscious within you, and your whole life becomes a ‘sitting in meditation’.\nPRACTICING EVERYTHING WITHOUT ANY SENSE OF ATTAINMENT IS CALLED THE EXCEEDINGLY PROFOUND TRANSCENDENT WISDOM.\nIf somebody asks you what is the purpose of your meditation... it is not a purposeful act. It is not a commodity, it does not produce anything marketable.\nThat’s why most of the people in the world have remained ignorant of their hidden treasure, because that hidden treasure can open up only when you are sitting without any desire of attainment. Attainment creates tension, worryAttainment creates impatience – when is it going to happen?\nwhether it is going to happen or not? Attainment creates jealousy: somebody is claiming that it has happened to him, how can it be that it has not happened to me?\nSardar Gurudayal Singh is laughing. And he does nothing, he just remains a buddha the whole day. You can find him in any position, but he will be the buddha. He has been with me for thirty-five years. Hitting him again and again, I have awakened him so much that now it is difficult for him to sleep! So he goes on waking up other people. What else to do when you cannot sleep? You cannot allow anybody else to sleep, it is too much.\nThe desire for attainment is a barrier to meditation. Even the desire to attain enlightenment is a barrier. One has to drop all desires for attainment. Now, nothing can be done about it; this is how nature functions.\nYou can’t ask any scientist, “Why is water made of only two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen, H2O? Why?” The scientist has to shrug his shoulders, because you cannot ask nature why. It is just the way nature moves. It is not in our hands.\nMeditation is far deeper. Its basic condition is that you should not desire any attainment. Now you cannot ask why. You can ask why but you will remain out of the world of meditation.\nThis is the nature of meditation, that it cannot function if your mind is occupied with some attainment. That attainment functions like a rock. Only a man who has nothing to attain, who is simply sitting for the joy of it, reaches to enlightenment so easily that it almost seems as if no effort has been made. In fact every effort shows that there is some attainment which you have to push aside. If there is no desire for attainment, immediately you are enlightened.\nFor the first few days you may walk amongst other people showing your enlightenment just like a peacock showing all its colored feathers. But for how long? And anyway, nobody takes any notice, because to understand enlightenment you need enlightenment.\nIn the world of blind people, if you have eyes you can go on and on moving around – nobody is going to recognize your eyes. To recognize somebody’s eyes you need eyes.\nEnlightenment is a third eye, the eye that looks inwards. It can be recognized only by those who have looked a little inwards, who may have been, for a few minutes, a buddha but have forgotten all about it in the mundane activities of the world.\nPRACTICING EVERYTHING WITHOUT ANY SENSE OF ATTAINMENT IS CALLED THE EXCEEDINGLY PROFOUND TRANSCENDENT WISDOM. THIS WISDOM CAN CUT OFF THE SOURCE OF BIRTH AND DEATH, LIKE A SHARP SWORD.\nYou will not be born again and you will not die again. In fact you will not be anymore. Your small energy will disappear into the oceanic energy of existence. That is true relaxation. That is total rest. You are no more there to have any anxieties.\nTO PRACTICE VIRTUE IN HOPES OF REWARD IS THE ILLUSION OF ORDINARY FOLK; BODHISATTVAS DO NOT SEEK FOR THE RESULTING REWARDS AS THEY CULTIVATE ROOTS OF VIRTUE, BECAUSE THEY CULTIVATE GOODNESS FOR THE SAKE OF IMPARTIAL LOVE AND COMPASSION, AND THUS IT BECOMES SUSTENANCE FOR ENLIGHTENMENT.\nEnlightenment has many doors. It is not open only to the so-called saints. An artist deep in his art, painting so totally that he disappears and only the painting remains – whether he knows it or not, for that moment he has become a buddha. A singer with his totality disappears in his song.\nEnlightenment is not the monopoly of the saints: that is one of the basic points I want to make clear to the world. There are a thousand and one doors. Only one single quality should be there – that\nyou are rejoicing in doing it, for no attainment. When a singer sings, if he is singing for some reward he cannot be total.\nI am reminded of one of India’s greatest singers, Tansen. Even today, in Gwalior, there is his samadhi and singers from all over the country go there on his birthday to pay their respects to that great genius. He was in the court of a great emperor, Akbar, and Akbar could not conceive that music could go higher or deeper than Tansen’s. But it became a continuous question in his mind: Is it possible to transcend Tansen? Can somebody do something more than he is doing?\nFinally he asked Tansen himself: “This question has been torturing me. I know that there is no one who can go so deep and create such beautiful music. Thousands of musicians have come to the court; they know the technique, but their totality is not in it.”\nTansen said, “Please forgive me. You don’t know my master – I am not even dust under his feet. You don’t know what totality in music is.”\nAkbar said, “Then invite your master to the court. We will give him all the respect that is possible.”\nTansen said, “That is the difficulty; that’s why I have never mentioned him.” He lived just near to where the Taj Mahal now stands. “He is a very silent, poor man, but he never sings on demand. That is the difficulty. You cannot call him and ask him to sing or play his sitar. When it comes spontaneously to him, then it is a totally different world – you will not be able even to compare me with him.”\nAkbar said, “You are creating trouble. If he cannot be asked, then how am I going to listen to him?”\nTansen said, “I know perfectly that at three o’clock, early in the morning almost every day, he plays his sitar. What can be arranged is that we should hide behind the trees where he lives in a hut by the side of the Ganges and just listen as thieves. There is no other way. If he becomes aware that somebody is there, he may stop. So be very quiet.” And perhaps never in the history of man has any emperor like Akbar gone to listen to a beggar.\nHis name was Haridas. In the middle of the night they were hiding behind the trees like thieves. At three o’clock exactly, Haridas started playing on his sitar, and Akbar wept for the first time. Returning home, his tears continued.\nTansen said to him, “Now we are coming close to the palace. Wash away your tears! Why are you weeping?”\nAkbar said, “I am weeping because now my whole idea that you are the greatest singer, the greatest musician in the world, is shattered. Your master is miles beyond. But what is the reason that you cannot manage to be the same as your master?”\nHe said, “The reason is clear: I sing and play for reward; he sings and plays out of spontaneity, for no reward, with no desire even that somebody should listen to it. Just out of his fullness, out of his abundance he pours out music. I cannot do it. I am a court poet, a court singer, a court musician: I do my best, but deep down there is a desire for reward. And you have been rewarding me, you have\nfilled my house with gold. You have raised my position to being the world’s greatest musician, but I know the greatest musician is a beggar who was my master.\n“I had to sit by his side for thirty years, because there was no other way. He would not teach you anything – if you could learn that was your business. He would play only when it came to him. You could watch, you could see the tremendous splendor that suddenly happened. Haridas disappeared, only the music remained.”\nIn those moments, when Haridas disappeared, he was a buddha whether he knew it or not. The activity may be in any direction, any dimension.\nI want everybody to know that if you can do something without any desire of reward or attainment, you are in meditation. You will blossom into enlightenment. Out of your abundance will come love and compassion, and for a few days you may walk differently from others. But soon you will realize that others cannot recognize it – that is one thing.\nAnd a second thing: it is ugly on your part, mean, to show your enlightenment, to show your light to the people who are blind. It is not compassionate. Soon the enlightened man forgets about his enlightenment. That is The Great Matter – forgetting even enlightenment. The whole world is gone and enlightenment too. Nothing remains behind, you have become part of the universe.\nThis is rest. This is relaxation.\nENLIGHTENMENT IS THE WAY TO EXTINCTION. IF YOU TAKE PEACE AND QUIET TO BE BLISS, ALL THINGS ARE AFFLICTIONS; BUT WHEN YOU ARE ENLIGHTENED, ALL THINGS ARE ENLIGHTENMENT. PEOPLE OF THE WORLD DO NOT UNDERSTAND THIS BASIS OF DELUSION AND ENLIGHTENMENT. THEY SUPPRESS THOUGHTS OF BIRTH AND DEATH AND THINK THAT THIS IS THE NON-BIRTH OF A SINGLE THOUGHT, AND ALSO CONSIDER THIS MINDLESSNESS – BUT THESE ARE STILL THOUGHTS OF BIRTH AND DEATH, NOT MINDLESSNESS, NOT QUIESCENCE. WHEN YOU TRY TO STOP THOUGHT BY THOUGHT, BIRTH AND DEATH CONTINUE.\nYou cannot stop thought with thought. You cannot control mind with mind itself. You have to be aloof, out of the mind, just watching it.\nPerhaps for a few days it may make a little fuss, that “You have deserted me!” Just go on watching. It will disappear because its nourishment is your identification with it. Now that you are no longer identified, it cannot last long. It will shrink, it will die out, it will disappear like smoke in the sky, and only the watcher remains.\nBut when there is nothing to watch, even the purpose of the watcher is not there. When there is nothing to watch, the watcher has committed suicide without knowing it. That’s why he is saying, ENLIGHTENMENT IS THE WAY TO EXTINCTION.\nYou will be extinguished, completely dissolved into the whole. Only then will you find... you will not be there, but only peace, but only light, but only joy, but only danceThe flower has disappeared,\nleaving behind only fragrance.\nTekkan wrote:\nNO MIND, NO BUDDHA, NO BEING. BONES OF THE VOID ARE SCATTERED. WHY SHOULD THE GOLDEN LION, SEEK OUT THE FOX’S LAIR?\nNo mind, and you find the buddha – but that buddha has also to disappear. No buddha, and you find the ultimate being of the universe – even that has to disappear. When everything has disappeared and you are completely erased, you have found the cosmic truth.\nIt is not your truth, it is not my truth, it is simply Truth. A Zen poet:\nALL IS HARMONY, YET EVERYTHING IS SEPARATE. ONCE CONFIRMED, MASTERY IS YOURS,\nLONG I HOVERED ON THE MIDDLE WAY,\nTODAY THE VERY ICE SHOOTS FLAME.\nBuddha’s path is called The Middle Way; no extremes, just keep in the middle.\nTODAY THE VERY ICE SHOOTS FLAME. “I have come to the point where ice and fire are in harmony, where everything is in harmony.” A better word for harmony would be synchronicity – everything is in a deep synchronicity, all hearts have become one heartbeat.\nAnother haiku runs:\nEVER ONWARDS TO WHERE THE WATERS HAVE AN END:\nWAITING MOTIONLESS FOR WHEN THE WHITE CLOUDS SHALL ARISE.\nMeditation is just like the rivers running towards the ocean: when they meet the ocean, they will disappear. They are running so fast to their extinction.\nBuddhism did not appeal much to the Indian priesthood, the brahmins, for the simple reason that for centuries they have been praying to God for rewards. All the VEDAS are full of asking God for this or that. The whole mind of India was not prepared to accept Buddha. The conditioning was, you pray, you make fire rituals, you sacrifice, and God will give you great rewards. You do virtuous acts and in paradise you will be paid a thousand times more.\nThis idea had been cultivated in India for thousands of years when Buddha said that this is not true religion, this is sheer business, this is not an authentic search for existence. You are still hankering for rewards. Because of this he had chosen the word ‘nirvana’ for his ultimate point.\nNirvana actually means blowing out a candle. When you blow out a candle, can you say where the flame has gone? Can you find the flame anywhere? It must have gone somewhere, but you know it is impossible to find it. It has disappeared in the universe.\nBuddha used the word ‘nirvana’, which we are translating as enlightenment; but the word ‘enlightenment’ does not carry the same flavor of extinction. It still gives the idea of attainment. Nirvana means seeking extinction, blowing out the candle in the cosmos.\nNaturally, hundreds of times in his forty-two years of preaching, great Hindu scholars, priests and philosophers approached Buddha and asked him, “What is the point in striving for something in which you will disappear?”\nQuestion 1\nManeesha has asked a similar question:\nOUR BELOVED MASTER,\nNOBODY IN THEIR RIGHT MIND WOULD WANT TO BE EXTINGUISHED. SO WHO OR WHAT IS IT INSIDE US THAT FEELS A PULL TOWARDS OBLITERATION?\nIt was absolutely right to ask Buddha, “Your teaching is strange: meditating seems to be the ultimate suicide. Why should one desire extinction?” But Buddha’s answer was very clear, although it was not received by the Indian mind.\nHis answer was very clear. He said, “Because you are the problem; hence extinction is the only solution.”\nIt is not that you have problems; this has to be understood very clearly. It is not that you have problems, so problems can be solved separately and you can be saved. If that were the situation, then Buddha would have been wrong. But this is not the situation. You are the problem. You cannot be without problems.\nJust think that one morning you wake up and you don’t have any problems – you will be in such grief. You will say, “My God, what am I going to do? No problems at all!”\nYou cling to problems because problems give you personality. They give you a certain identity.\nWithout problems, you are no more. You are just a collection of problems. That’s why Buddha is right, that meditation is the extinction not only of problems but of you too, because you were nothing but a collection, a name for a collection of problems. When all the problems are gone, you are gone... you are not separate from your problems. Buddha’s greatest contribution to the world was the realization that man himself is the problem. You may go on changing problems – that is possible – but you cannot exist without problems. There is no need! If you don’t have any problem, what is the point of existing?\nPsychologists now say that after retirement, people lose almost ten years of life. If they had remained working they would have lived ten years more, but because they got retired... They had been hankering for years to be retired so they could go on a world tour or visit ancient palaces, castles, the Himalayas. They will enjoy, life will be fun. Up to now life has been just work, work, work. After retirement they can enjoy life as fun.\nBut after retirement they find that life has become absolutely useless. Nobody needs them. Their children are grown up, they have gone their way. And even if they tour around the world...\nI have seen tourists with all kinds of cameras and bags and machinery covering both their sides, but look at their faces! They know that they are unnecessarily running from the Taj Mahal to Ajanta, from Ajanta to Ellora. They know perfectly well that all this is useless; they are simply keeping themselves engaged in something which is futile. Now death seems to be the only release. Naturally their lifespan shrinks.\nWhat Gautam Buddha is saying is a very ultimate answer to man. He says that you are the problem. It does not matter what shape the problem takes – unless you are ready to extinguish yourself, the problem will go on coming in new forms. Youth has its problems, childhood has its problems; the child wants quickly to grow up.\nI have been talking to small children. They all want to grow up quickly because they see that others are enjoying – smoking cigarettes, going to the movies, having girlfriends. They want to grow as quickly as possible.\nOnce I used to live by the side of a post office, and I used to go early, at three o’clock in the morning, for a walk. One night I saw a little boy. It was a full-moon night, so I could figure out who he was; he was the postmaster’s son. And seeing me, he hid himself behind a tree.\nI got hold of him and I asked, “What is the matter? Why are you hiding? Just come out.” He said, “I will come out, but don’t tell my daddy.”\nI said, “What is the problem, that you are trying to hide?”\nHe was hiding an artificial mustache, and a cigarette. He was pretending to be his father. He was walking the same way as his father walked.He said, “Just don’t tell him, otherwise he will give me\na good beating.”\nI said, “What is the hurry? Someday the mustache will grow, and then you can smoke cigarettes also. It is too soon.”\nHe said, “I have been waiting and waiting and everybody seems to be enjoying and I have to go on playing with toys. Whenever I make a fuss my father brings another toy. How long do I have to be with toys? I want real things!”\nI said, “You can have real toys.”\nHe said, “I have! I can show you in my house, you come with me. I have a beautiful girl who opens her eyes and if you lie her down she closes her eyes. But after all it is only a toy! – it is not a real girlfriend.”\nI said, “That’s true!”\nSmall children have their problems. When they grow up, they have their problems. The same girlfriends, the same boyfriends that they had wanted become a nightmare, nagging each other, torturing each other, doing everything nasty to each other and still holding together. It is very difficult to get rid of your torturer, because deep down you also feel alone if nobody tortures you.\nThe Hindu shastras say that you have to beat your woman once a week absolutely; otherwise she will think you don’t love her. I think there is something in it! If you don’t beat your girlfriend, she will beat you. It is up to you to choose.\nGeorge Bernard Shaw used to say that giving women equality is impossible. When asked why he said, “My lifelong experience” – and nobody has lived so long as he has lived, he almost made a century – “My experience is, either you keep the woman down with force or she will keep you down. Equality is not possible. Either you are superior or she is superior. One of you has to be inferior at any cost.”\nEquality is impossible, according to George Bernard Shaw, and I can see the point. It is always difficult.\nSo when you are young you have your troubles and you want to get out of this troubled age quickly, but problems remain.\nAs old age starts coming one becomes afraid, because old age means death is not far away. And old age means the younger generation around you is no longer interested in you. You are too old, too out of fashion. You cannot mix with the younger generation, they avoid you. You are finished; just understand the point that you are finished. All your false teeth won’t help.\nThere are people around who have everything false, and they are thinking to deceive younger people. But how long can you deceive? – in the night you have to take out your false teeth. One day you may not be observed, but the second day... while sleeping your false hair falls from your skull, and the woman who is lying beside you cannot believe that you have been deceiving her! But everything seems to be false.\nThere is an age where false things are needed; otherwise you are out-of-date. But what are you doing here? Just go to your graves! Meditate there! The world has left you alone. Old age... and death seems to be knocking at any moment on your door, and the fear of the unknown... Your whole life is a problem.\nFrom the very birth the child resists coming out of the womb because he has lived for nine months in a most comfortable, most luxurious place. No work, and every need is automatically provided – why should he leave this place? And who knows what is outside? That is why women have so much trouble giving birth to a child: the child clings, the child does not want to come out. From that moment, up to when you are put on a funeral pyre, you are just trouble – to yourself and to others.\nManeesha, that is the need, the desire, for ultimate annihilation, dissolving into the universe – so that you don’t have any personal needs, any personal problems; so that you don’t have any burden, not even of being, because being is also a burden.\nBuddha’s insight is so great that he is still ahead of his time. Even though twenty-five centuries have passed, he has not yet found his contemporaries, because what he is saying is so ultimately true that it hurts, that one wants not to see it, to close one’s eyes.\nIt was for this reason that Buddhism could not grow in India – because India’s mind was, for centuries, cultivated with the idea that prayer, meditation, yoga, everything is for a reward.\nAnd Buddha says, “If you have any idea of reward, you will miss. The very idea of attaining something will prevent you from merging into existence.” It was so contrary to people’s minds that only a few very intelligent people followed him. And after he died, within three hundred years... just three hundred years after his death, not even a ripple remained. In India, Buddhism has completely disappeared.\nThree hundred years later Alexander the Great came to India. He wanted to meet some Buddhist saints, but he could not. He could not find any. Why did it disappear so quickly, such a great insight? The reason is, the Indian mind is basically greedy. It talks about renunciation, but even renunciation is for a reward. It talks about charity, but charity is also for a reward. Everything is business.\nBuddhism managed to grow its roots in China, in Korea, in Japan, in Thailand, for the simple reason that they were not so-called religious people. China was under the great impact of Confucius, who did not believe in God, who did not believe in any heaven or any hell. Buddhism found the right ground where people were not asking for attainment, even after death. And Japan was even more fertile a land; they did not have the Indian greed.\nIt is very strange that India continues to claim to the whole world that it is the only spiritual land. It is all cow dung. I have lived for half a century, and I have watched the Indian mind from all sides – they are more greedy than any people in the world, but they have made even their greed spirituality.\nBuddha could not make his roots here for the simple reason that the Indian mind was already prejudiced and prepared for having great pleasures beyond death. It could not lose those pleasures. And naturally, to the mind, the question that Maneesha is asking arises.\n“Nobody in their right mind” – that is true... “Nobody in their right mind would want to be extinguished.”\nBut who is there who is in their right mind? In fact, when you are in your right mind, you would love to be extinguished. Only the insane want to continue. What is the point? Just think for a moment: before you were born, do you think there was something missing in the world? And think again: when you will be dead, do you think something will be missing in the world? Millions of people have come and gone – the world continues.\nBuddha is saying: Birth is pain, youth is pain, old age is pain, death is pain – why do you want to continue? For what? His meditation is a search for dissolving oneself back into the cosmos. It is total rest, rest from yourself; total freedom, freedom even from yourself.\nThis is one of the reasons I am not part of India. Those who have come to me from all over the world are not greedy people. They really want to understand that life is a problem, that mind is a problem. In fact, to be is to be a problem. Then why not be courageous and not be?\nYou will find very few Indians here; they are all against me. Again they find another buddha teaching annihilation, extinction, teaching ultimate death. But only very intelligent people can understand it. Buddhism is for the most sophisticated, for the most intelligent. It is not for the ordinary people, for the mediocre. They will go on suffering, but they will never understand that their very being is suffering. Non-being is the freedom from suffering.\nA few laughs before you disappear, die, extinguish... and this time really go. At least for a few moments you will be a buddha, and there is no harm if you don’t come back. We will still celebrate – it is a promise.\nDilly and Dally, two salesmen, are standing together at the bar, talking about football. At the other end of the bar an old drunk is having trouble holding himself and his drink upright at the same time.\nSuddenly Dilly notices a very unpleasant smell. “Hey, Dally!” he says, “do you smell shit?”\nDally sniffs the air, nods and starts to hold his nose.\n“I think it’s coming from that old drunk over there,” he says.\n“Excuse me,” says Dally to the old guy, “but there is a terrible smell around here. Did you shit in your pants?”\nThe bleary-eyed drunk lifts up his head and stares at Dilly. “Yup,” he slobbers, “what about it?”\n“Well,” says a shocked Dilly, “why don’t you go to the bathroom and wash yourself?”\nThe old drunk stares back, blinking, and then says, “Because I haven’t finished yet!”\nThree secretaries, Betty, Boopsee and Barbara, are working in the same office for the same boss, the famous male chauvinist tyrant, Dumford Porkeye.\n“He is so mean,” says Betty to Boopsee and Barbara on their coffee break, “so yesterday I put salt in his sugar bowl just to watch his face when he drank his coffee.”\n“That’s nothing,” says Boopsee. “I found a pack of condoms in his desk drawer and took a pin and put holes in the ends of all them!”\nAt that moment, Barbara fainted.\nDonald Dixteen is touring Spain. He is looking at the boats in the harbor of a small fishing village, when Old Carlos comes over to him and asks, “How many boats do you see there in the water?”\n“About twenty-five,” replies Donald.\n“Twenty-eight, in fact!” says Carlos. “And I built every one of them with my own hands! But do my neighbors call me Carlos the boat builder? They do not! How many houses do you see on the hillside over there?” continues Carlos.\n“Thirty-two,” replies Donald.\n“Correct!” agrees Carlos, “all built by me. But do my neighbors call me Carlos the house-builder? They do not!\n“Well, what do they call you?” insists Donald. “Carlos the what?” “What do they call me?” exclaims Carlos, eyeing a nearby hen lovingly.\n“You wouldn’t believe it,” explains Carlos, “just because of that one little chicken I fucked!” Nivedano...\n(Drumbeat) (Gibberish) Nivedano... (Drumbeat)\nBe silent, close your eyes. Feel your body to be frozen.\nGather your consciousness inwards,\ndeeper and deeper.…\nThis silence, this peace, this blissfulness discovers the buddha within you.\nFor these few moments you are a buddha and it is up to you, if you can remember – then you can be a buddha twenty-four hours. ‘Buddha’ simply means silent awareness.\nAnd the silent awareness is not something dead, it is full of joy,\nit is full of juice, it is full of dance.\nIt has a music of its own.\nTo make it more clear, Nivedano... (Drumbeat)\nRelax.…\nRelax into the universe.\nDrop yourself, with all your problems. Just don’t be!\nThis is transcending even the buddha. This is entering into the cosmos itself, losing all your personality, individuality. The dewdrop slipping from the lotus leaf into the ocean...\nThis is the most blissful\nand ecstatic moment of your life.\nContinue to remember it. It is your own nature.\nIt is not something uncommon, it is not something extraordinary,\nit is just pure nature, simply very ordinary, without any claim to anything.\nThis brings so much light and so much delight that it starts overflowing in you.\nNivedano... (Drumbeat)\nCome back, but don’t come back leaving your experience behind – bring it with you.\nSlowly, gracefully resurrect.\nSit for a few seconds as buddhas, collecting,\nremembering where you have been... the experience...\nso that it becomes an undercurrent in your life twenty-four hours a day.\nIt can change all your gestures, activities –\nnot only yours, it can change people around you. It is infectious.\nShare it, don’t be a miser!\nOkay, Maneesha?\nYes, Beloved Master.\nCan we celebrate the ten thousand buddhas? Yes, Beloved Master.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"9035","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/turning_in/part4/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/turning_in/>Turning In</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">4 Enlightenment is the way to extinction</h1><div class=post-meta>43 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;9035 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Turning_In/part4.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part3>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

THE ENLIGHTENED
MIND ITSELF BASICALLY HAS NO DELUSION OR ENLIGHTENMENT. THIS IS ACTUALLY
THE SUBTLE ART OF THOSE WHO REALIZE THUSNESS. EVEN IF YOU DON’T BECOME
ENLIGHTENED, WHEN YOU SIT ONCE IN MEDITATION, YOU ARE A BUDDHA FOR THAT
SITTING; WHEN YOU SIT FOR A DAY IN MEDITATION, YOU ARE A BUDDHA FOR A
DAY; WHEN YOU SIT IN MEDITATION ALL YOUR LIFE, YOU ARE A BUDDHA ALL YOUR
LIFE. THE SAME IS TRUE OF THE FUTURE; ONE WHO CAN HAVE FAITH IN THIS IS
SOMEONE WITH GREAT POTENTIAL.</p><p><br></p><p>PRACTICING EVERYTHING WITHOUT ANY SENSE OF ATTAINMENT IS CALLED THE
EXCEEDINGLY PROFOUND TRANSCENDENT WISDOM. THIS WISDOM CAN CUT OFF THE
SOURCE OF BIRTH AND DEATH, LIKE A SHARP SWORD.</p><p><br></p><p>TO PRACTICE VIRTUE IN HOPES OF REWARD IS THE ILLUSION OF ORDINARY
FOLK; BODHISATTVAS DO NOT SEEK FOR THE RESULTING REWARDS AS THEY
CULTIVATE ROOTS OF VIRTUE, BECAUSE THEY CULTIVATE GOODNESS FOR THE SAKE
OF IMPARTIAL LOVE AND COMPASSION, AND THUS IT BECOMES SUSTENANCE FOR
ENLIGHTENMENT. AS FOR THOSE WHO SEEK REWARDS AS THEY CULTIVATE VIRTUE
AND ATTAIN THE LESSER REWARD OF HUMANITY OR GOD-HOOD, THIS IS SURELY THE
WORK OF BIRTH AND DEATH.</p><p>ENLIGHTENMENT IS THE WAY TO EXTINCTION. IF YOU TAKE PEACE AND QUIET
TO BE BLISS, ALL THINGS ARE AFFLICTIONS; BUT WHEN YOU ARE ENLIGHTENED,
ALL THINGS ARE ENLIGHTENMENT. PEOPLE OF THE WORLD DO NOT UNDERSTAND THIS
BASIS OF DELUSION AND ENLIGHTENMENT. THEY SUPPRESS THOUGHTS OF BIRTH AND
DEATH, AND THINK THAT THIS IS THE NON-BIRTH OF A SINGLE THOUGHT, AND
ALSO CONSIDER THIS MINDLESSNESS – BUT THESE ARE STILL THOUGHTS OF BIRTH
AND DEATH, NOT MINDLESSNESS, NOT QUIESCENCE. WHEN YOU TRY TO STOP
THOUGHT BY THOUGHT, BIRTH AND DEATH CONTINUE.</p><p><br></p><p>Maneesha, the whole question for Zen is how not to discriminate. Mind
is discrimination, division, duality. The effort of Zen is to bring you
to a space where you are simply a watcher, without any judgment. At the
moment you are simply a watcher, all that is false disappears on its own
accord and all that is real shines forth in its absolute
illumination.</p><p><br></p><p>This is your home. In this space there is no mind; hence no desire,
no jealousy, no anger, no hate. You have become just a mirror. You
reflect the tremendous glory and splendor of the whole existence. For
the first time you have gone beyond human conditionings. You have become
universal.</p><p><br></p><p>Obviously, in this moment, in this space, there is no darkness. And
remember clearly: darkness and light are two aspects of the same coin.
When darkness disappears, light also disappears. What is left is
tremendously new, you have not even dreamed of it.</p><p><br></p><p>In this clarity, in this silence, the whole existence seems to be
exactly what it is, not what it is “supposed to be.” Your enlightenment
becomes, suddenly, the enlightenment of the whole universe.</p><p><br></p><p>This is one of the most important points that Daikaku is making. And
there is a second important point which he is making, which is very
rare. Perhaps nobody else has ever made this statement before, but it is
absolutely true. While you are in meditation, in silence – even for a
single moment – you are a buddha. You can come out, and you can again
forget.</p><p><br></p><p>You can sit in meditation for one hour, or if meditation becomes your
undercurrent of consciousness, you can remain a buddha for twenty-four
hours. In other words, whenever you are aware and silent and whenever
you feel the whole existence to be enlightened, you are a buddha. You
can forget it – it is your freedom to forget or to remember.</p><p><br></p><p>A very rare genius, Daikaku, makes this statement: “Ordinary masters
will not enter into the lion’s den.” It is a very strange statement,
with no precedent. But I can say to you, it is true: every day you
become a buddha. I see you coming back from your home, resurrecting. You
are a totally different man – so silent, so peaceful, so fragrant, such
a beauty to see.</p><p><br></p><p>But I know you will forget. Forgetfulness has been your habit for
millions of years. So this one moment of buddhahood will become a
beautiful memory, and then the forgetfulness comes like a flood of old
habit and the whole moon disappears behind the black clouds. But the
moon is there; we will discover it again. There is no harm in
discovering your buddhahood again and again.</p><p><br></p><p>One can hope, one can trust that one day these old habits will become
weakened and your whole buddhahood will become a simple matter, just
like breathing.</p><p>But nobody except Daikaku has made the point – that even for a single
moment, if you are silent and push aside all your thoughts and habits,
clearing the space of the mind which has been occupying it for
centuries... even though it may only remain for a single moment, you are
a buddha. Perhaps you will have to remember again and again till the old
habits start dying out. They will die because they don’t have any roots.
Unless you support and nourish them, they cannot exist.</p><p><br></p><p>It is a strange story that man supports his misery, nourishes it,
takes care that it does not leave him, because it is his only companion.
People magnify their miseries, if they cannot magnify anything else.</p><p><br></p><p>In the university where I was a professor, a woman was also a
professor. Her husband was a very prominent advocate of the High Court.
Because I used to pass by where they lived, coming from the university
or going to the university, the woman was always waiting there for a
lift. The husband saw it once or twice and the third time he came to see
me in the university and he told me, “I am worried about you.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “What is the matter?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “You are giving my wife a lift every day. Don’t believe her
– she is such a hypochondriac. Just a small cough and immediately she
says, ‘I am suffering from tuberculosis.’ Don’t listen to what she says!
It is her habit to enjoy her misery. She paints it as deeply as
possible, she is almost a creative artist – suffering and
suffering.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “You don’t have to tell me. I enjoy her and I am not worried
about her tuberculosis. She is not an exception, she is the rule.”</p><p><br></p><p>Everybody is trying to magnify his sufferings, his miseries. It is a
very sad condition that rather than jumping out of this vicious circle,
you go on weaving around yourself more and more of the same stuff. But
there is a very deep pay-off in it: it brings sympathy to you. It is not
for no reason at all that people magnify their misery. It simply shows
that they have not received love.</p><p><br></p><p>I told the husband, “You think that your wife is wrong. I want to say
to you that you have not loved her enough. Seeking shelter in misery
comes only when nobody loves you; you can always fall upon your misery
as an old friend. When you are miserable everybody is sympathetic to
you, when you are not miserable nobody cares about you.”</p><p><br></p><p>The whole psychology is upside-down. People should pay attention to
others when they are looking radiant, joyful, blissful. That will be
giving nourishment, because attention is nourishment. Never give
attention to misery, because you are nourishing the misery. You are
forcing the person to remain miserable because sympathy is so sweet –
but it is a sweet poison. It is not, and cannot be, a substitute for the
joy of love.</p><p><br></p><p>But people settle at the minimum. If love is not coming their way and
they don’t know how to get it, immediately the alternative seems to be
misery. Then people pay attention to you. So I told the husband, “Just
try to be a little more loving.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “My God, I hate to go home, and you are telling me to be
loving to that woman? As I enter the house she starts her tirade of
imaginable and unimaginable illnesses. And she goes on reading</p><p>medical encyclopedias, finding out what kind of misery would be good.
She knows great names. In the beginning she used to freak me out, that
‘My God, I have never heard of this disease!’ And she would give the
whole description of what was happening. Only later on I found the
encyclopedia and the exact description, and she had marked it. At first
I used to take it seriously and take her to the doctor. And every doctor
said, ‘This misery has just been discovered. This disease is only just
in the periodicals; only experts know about it. Your wife is a real
genius! Even ordinary practitioners, physicians, doctors, will not
understand what kind of disease she is talking about!’”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I remain in the court as long as I can, then in the court
library. And then I go to the bar, because I can tolerate that woman
only when I am drunk. I wanted to warn you because you are giving her a
lift every day – you may end up in my situation!”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Don’t be worried. I never sympathize, I simply enjoy. She
talks as you are saying and I encourage her to talk more, because I love
such details. And she looks at me with very weird eyes: ‘... A strange
fellow. I am suffering from cancer, I say to you!’”</p><p><br></p><p>I told her, “Suffer! Just tell me the details – I love it. You know
so much about cancer. Obviously, you must be suffering, even cancer
experts may not be able to defeat you, but please give me all the
details. I love it so much!”</p><p><br></p><p>In three days I stopped her. She would sit completely silently,
keeping her face looking out of the window. And I would go on poking
her: “Please tell me something. You are so great, you are carrying such
a burden of the whole world. You are almost an encyclopedia of
medicine.”</p><p><br></p><p>She stopped asking for a lift. I had to go inside their house and ask
her husband, “Where is she? – because I enjoy her so much.” She was such
a nice woman, so knowledgeable! And I am absolutely ignorant about these
great diseases. It was just a great teaching on the way – for one hour
coming, one hour going; for two hours every day I would become an
expert!</p><p><br></p><p>I have been in touch with thousands of people – they have all been
victims of a wrong psychology. Their parents have paid attention to them
when they were sick. Nobody bothers about a child when he is not sick.
This is a very dangerous phenomenon: you are forcing the child to be
sick because you are giving attention, and attention is a subtle
food.</p><p><br></p><p>I had a gardener, an authentic gardener, who really loved flowers,
who loved the plants. And I would see him sitting by the side of the
roses and other flowers. Sometimes I heard him talking to the flowers.
At first I thought he looked a little crazy, but every year he was
winning the first prize in the city for growing the biggest flowers. He
was with me for almost twelve years.</p><p><br></p><p>I asked him, “What is your secret?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Nothing, I am just a little crazy. When there is nobody
around, I talk to the flowers: ‘Don’t let me down this time. The time
for the exhibition is coming close – grow as big as you can.’ And I have
been winning for twenty years continuously. No flower has ever let me
down.”</p><p><br></p><p>Just the attention, just a loving attention to a flower, makes him
immensely happy. There is someone who will be happy: the flower will do
everything for him to make him happy. There is someone who is watching
and waiting for his growth; he is not alone, he is not unneeded.</p><p>This whole world looks so miserable for the simple reason that we
have chosen to give attention to the wrong things, things which should
be taken care of but without any sympathy.</p><p><br></p><p>You can love somebody, but please don’t love her headaches. Just make
sure that she goes and gets some Greek aspirin. More than that is
destroying the person. But when she is laughing, enjoy her, don’t even
ask the question, why is she laughing? When she is dancing, dance with
her; don’t ask, “What is the occasion?”</p><p><br></p><p>Pay attention to the right things and you will see a transformation
happening in the person. You can help not only yourself in discovering
your buddha, you can also help everybody else who is in contact with
you. If you give right attention, right nourishment to his hidden
treasure, to his hidden splendor, you can help buddhahood to be spread
like a wildfire.</p><p><br></p><p>And we need it! We have always needed it, but we need it more than
ever now. We need a silent, peaceful, loving, at-ease and relaxed
humanity. Enough of all those Genghis Khans and Tamerlanes and Nadir
Shahs and Adolf Hitlers and Stalins and Mussolinis. If educationists of
the world are a little aware, they should simply drop these people from
the history books; there is no need to give attention to them. It is the
same thing. You give too much attention to these terrible barbarians...
you provoke the same barbarians around you, and somebody else starts
becoming a Nadir Shah or a Tamerlane.</p><p><br></p><p>Just drop all that nonsense, that garbage. Why not talk about the
buddhas? Why not talk about the beautiful painters? Why not talk about
the great dancers, the musicians, all kinds of artists? Let people’s
minds be filled with creativity, and it will be very easy for a creative
person to find the buddha. The destructive person has gone too far away;
to bring him back to his buddhahood is very difficult.</p><p><br></p><p>I am reminded of Alexander the Great, who is one of the most terrible
specimens of all those barbarians. While coming out of Greece, on the
boundaries, he met one of the most beautiful men. No history book
bothers about that beautiful man, and so many pages are wasted on
Alexander.</p><p><br></p><p>He met Diogenes.</p><p><br></p><p>Diogenes lived naked; the climate was good, his health was good. All
that he possessed was a lamp. He used to keep it lit even in the
daytime. Alexander had heard many stories about Diogenes. But by chance,
while he was moving, somebody told him that Diogenes was just nearby,
living by the side of a river. So Alexander stopped his army and he
said, “I will have to see the man. I have been thinking to see him but
he was so far away; I cannot miss this opportunity.”</p><p><br></p><p>So he went to see Diogenes. Diogenes was having a sunbath by the side
of the river, on the sand in the early morning sun – a cool breeze,
birds singing all around, his lamp by his side. Alexander had seen many
beautiful women, many beautiful men, but nothing could be compared with
the beauty, the radiance of this naked fakir. He could not believe his
eyes that a man could be such pure gold that he need not be hidden
behind clothes.</p><p><br></p><p>What is of importance, in reference to Daikaku, is the question that
Diogenes asked Alexander: “Where are you going? – because I hear armies
going by my side, day and night, thousands of soldiers. Where are you
going?”</p><p>Alexander said, “I want to conquer the world.”</p><p><br></p><p>Diogenes said, “That’s good. What will you do after that?” Nobody had
ever asked that. For a moment there was silence. Alexander said, “After
that I will relax.”</p><p>Diogenes said, “You must be stupid, because I am relaxing already
without conquering the whole world. If you want to relax afterward, why
take the trouble? Why not relax now? This river bank is big enough – we
can both share it. Just throw your clothes away and lie down. And we can
even share the lamp.”</p><p><br></p><p>Alexander said, “Logically you are right.” He understood logic
because he was a student of Aristotle, the father of Western logic.</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I can understand the logic. It looks stupid after taking so
much trouble to kill and massacre, and then afterwards just to relax.
Why not relax now? You are right. But I have gone too far. It is just a
question of a few months more and my conquest of the world will be over.
Otherwise, even relaxing by your side, I will go on remembering that it
was only a question of a few months more. I will not be able to relax. I
can relax only after I conquer the whole world.”</p><p><br></p><p>Diogenes said, “It is up to you. I was even ready to share my
riverside. I was even ready to share my lamp, my only property.”</p><p><br></p><p>Alexander was continuously watching the lamp. In the day? – what was
the point of keeping the lamp burning?</p><p><br></p><p>He asked, “Forgive me, I have no right to ask, but why do you carry
this lamp even in the full daylight? The sunlight is there, and you go
on carrying this lamp, naked.”</p><p><br></p><p>Diogenes said, “I am searching for an authentic man. Who knows at
what time he will meet me? I want to see his face, the original face.
This lamp is just symbolic.”</p><p><br></p><p>It is said that when Diogenes was dying, somebody from the crowd
asked, “What happened to your great search for the original man?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I could not find him. But this much I must say in favor of
humanity: that my lamp has not been stolen, it is still with me. More
than that I cannot say.”</p><p><br></p><p>History should teach more about these people. And there have been
thousands around the world; they will provoke a longing in the people’s
minds.</p><p><br></p><p>Just today Shunyo was telling me that Anando is compiling a book on
all the saints that I have spoken on. She has already found three
hundred names. She was puzzled; she said, “I never could imagine that
there have been three hundred buddhas.”</p><p>I said to her, “This is just a sample. Humanity is kept completely
unaware of their greatest masterpieces, of their real original people
who are the very salt of the earth.”</p><p><br></p><p>The natural effect is that everybody goes on becoming more miserable.
Every generation is more miserable than the previous one.</p><p><br></p><p>I have been hearing from California that even six-year-old children
have been found, in thousands, to be taking drugs. A six-year-old child
taking drugs? An eight-year-old child murdering? A nine- year-old child
trying to rape a girl...? But when you emphasize so much murder, drugs
and rape on the television, you are teaching these things. All these
governments and all these corporations are emphasizing the wrong kind of
people on their television and radio, not knowing at all that they are
creating an urge in millions of viewers to imitate them. These crimes
should not even be mentioned.</p><p><br></p><p>Pay attention to the right, to the beautiful, and you will be
nourishing it.</p><p><br></p><p>So your work is not only to be a buddha, your work is also to help
others who are asleep, by throwing a little cold water in their eyes! In
the beginning they will be irritated. Everybody is irritated with me. It
is not acceptable to disturb somebody’s sleep; and a sleep which has
lasted for centuries... to disturb it, you are certainly a nuisance. But
I want you to be a nuisance. As your own experience deepens, don’t be
worried, spread it, even to those who are annoyed; it does not matter.
Perhaps just being annoyed may take them out of their nightmares.</p><p><br></p><p>DAIKAKU SAID:</p><p><br></p><p>THIS TEACHING IS THE SCHOOL OF THE ENLIGHTENED MIND. THE ENLIGHTENED
MIND ITSELF BASICALLY HAS NO DELUSION OR ENLIGHTENMENT.</p><p><br></p><p>Every statement has to be listened to very carefully. He is saying
the enlightened Mind has neither mind nor enlightenment; it is simply a
pure consciousness. Don’t cling to enlightenment either: that clinging
shows that you have destroyed the enlightenment, reduced it into some
kind of thing – respectability, reputation. It is none of these.</p><p><br></p><p>Enlightenment is so silent a joy... it does not even make ripples in
the lake, it just reflects the moon. It is so silent, just like the
bamboo shadows sweeping the temple steps. No sound, no footsteps.</p><p><br></p><p>THE ENLIGHTENED MIND ITSELF BASICALLY HAS NO DELUSION OR
ENLIGHTENMENT.</p><p><br></p><p>There have been thousands of enlightened people who have said that
the enlightened Mind has no delusion, but they have forgotten to add
that it has no enlightenment either. It is just like a disease: you have
a disease, you carry a medicine with you. The disease is cured – do you
still think to carry the medicine? You just donate it to the Lions
Club!</p><p><br></p><p>So when you become enlightened just donate it to the Lions Club!
Perhaps somebody may need it. But don’t carry it with you; otherwise
enlightenment itself becomes a new imprisonment. Do you see the immense
significance of his statement? This actually is the subtle art of those
who realize thusness.</p><p>EVEN IF YOU DON’T BECOME ENLIGHTENED, WHEN YOU SIT ONCE IN
MEDITATION, YOU ARE A BUDDHA FOR THAT SITTING.</p><p><br></p><p>So when I say to you after your meditation that now we should
celebrate the ten thousand buddhas, I am not joking. I am making a
certain point again and again to you that you may forget after a few
minutes, and rush to a party somewhere in a hotel! Buddhas are not
supposed to do that! But times have changed – modern buddhas always do
that. After having a good experience they celebrate it in many ways. And
where to go to celebrate, to have a real Italian party?</p><p><br></p><p>Nothing is wrong in it if you go on remembering that you are a
buddha. Nothing is wrong in the world if your remembrance remains there
in the background.</p><p><br></p><p>He is making a really great statement, never before made.</p><p><br></p><p>WHEN YOU SIT ONCE IN MEDITATION, YOU ARE A BUDDHA FOR THAT SITTING...
at least; WHEN YOU SIT FOR A DAY IN MEDITATION, YOU ARE A BUDDHA FOR A
DAY; WHEN YOU SIT IN MEDITATION ALL YOUR LIFE, YOU ARE A BUDDHA ALL YOUR
LIFE. THE SAME IS TRUE OF THE FUTURE; ONE WHO CAN HAVE FAITH IN THIS IS
SOMEONE WITH GREAT POTENTIAL.</p><p><br></p><p>Sitting in meditation should be understood clearly: you cannot sit
twenty-four hours in meditation, but you can be twenty-four hours in
meditation. That is what is called ‘sitting in meditation’. Don’t take
it literally. It does not mean that you have to sit twenty-four hours in
meditation. It simply means that whatever you do, do with the
remembrance, with the same silence and the same benediction, with the
same grace and the same ecstasy.</p><p><br></p><p>Whatever you are doing, it does not matter: carrying water from the
well, chopping wood, anything. But just do it with your buddha alive
within you, conscious within you, and your whole life becomes a ‘sitting
in meditation’.</p><p><br></p><p>PRACTICING EVERYTHING WITHOUT ANY SENSE OF ATTAINMENT IS CALLED THE
EXCEEDINGLY PROFOUND TRANSCENDENT WISDOM.</p><p><br></p><p>If somebody asks you what is the purpose of your meditation... it is
not a purposeful act. It is not a commodity, it does not produce
anything marketable.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why most of the people in the world have remained ignorant of
their hidden treasure, because that hidden treasure can open up only
when you are sitting without any desire of attainment. Attainment
creates tension, worry<span class=s4></span>Attainment creates
impatience – when is it going to happen?</p><p>whether it is going to happen or not? Attainment creates jealousy:
somebody is claiming that it has happened to him, how can it be that it
has not happened to me?</p><p><br></p><p>Sardar Gurudayal Singh is laughing. And he does nothing, he just
remains a buddha the whole day. You can find him in any position, but he
will be the buddha. He has been with me for thirty-five years. Hitting
him again and again, I have awakened him so much that now it is
difficult for him to sleep! So he goes on waking up other people. What
else to do when you cannot sleep? You cannot allow anybody else to
sleep, it is too much.</p><p>The desire for attainment is a barrier to meditation. Even the desire
to attain enlightenment is a barrier. One has to drop all desires for
attainment. Now, nothing can be done about it; this is how nature
functions.</p><p><br></p><p>You can’t ask any scientist, “Why is water made of only two atoms of
hydrogen and one atom of oxygen, H2O? Why?” The scientist has to shrug
his shoulders, because you cannot ask nature why. It is just the way
nature moves. It is not in our hands.</p><p><br></p><p>Meditation is far deeper. Its basic condition is that you should not
desire any attainment. Now you cannot ask why. You can ask why but you
will remain out of the world of meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the nature of meditation, that it cannot function if your
mind is occupied with some attainment. That attainment functions like a
rock. Only a man who has nothing to attain, who is simply sitting for
the joy of it, reaches to enlightenment so easily that it almost seems
as if no effort has been made. In fact every effort shows that there is
some attainment which you have to push aside. If there is no desire for
attainment, immediately you are enlightened.</p><p><br></p><p>For the first few days you may walk amongst other people showing your
enlightenment just like a peacock showing all its colored feathers. But
for how long? And anyway, nobody takes any notice, because to understand
enlightenment you need enlightenment.</p><p><br></p><p>In the world of blind people, if you have eyes you can go on and on
moving around – nobody is going to recognize your eyes. To recognize
somebody’s eyes you need eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>Enlightenment is a third eye, the eye that looks inwards. It can be
recognized only by those who have looked a little inwards, who may have
been, for a few minutes, a buddha but have forgotten all about it in the
mundane activities of the world.</p><p><br></p><p>PRACTICING EVERYTHING WITHOUT ANY SENSE OF ATTAINMENT IS CALLED THE
EXCEEDINGLY PROFOUND TRANSCENDENT WISDOM. THIS WISDOM CAN CUT OFF THE
SOURCE OF BIRTH AND DEATH, LIKE A SHARP SWORD.</p><p><br></p><p>You will not be born again and you will not die again. In fact you
will not be anymore. Your small energy will disappear into the oceanic
energy of existence. That is true relaxation. That is total rest. You
are no more there to have any anxieties.</p><p><br></p><p>TO PRACTICE VIRTUE IN HOPES OF REWARD IS THE ILLUSION OF ORDINARY
FOLK; BODHISATTVAS DO NOT SEEK FOR THE RESULTING REWARDS AS THEY
CULTIVATE ROOTS OF VIRTUE, BECAUSE THEY CULTIVATE GOODNESS FOR THE SAKE
OF IMPARTIAL LOVE AND COMPASSION, AND THUS IT BECOMES SUSTENANCE FOR
ENLIGHTENMENT.</p><p><br></p><p>Enlightenment has many doors. It is not open only to the so-called
saints. An artist deep in his art, painting so totally that he
disappears and only the painting remains – whether he knows it or not,
for that moment he has become a buddha. A singer with his totality
disappears in his song.</p><p><br></p><p>Enlightenment is not the monopoly of the saints: that is one of the
basic points I want to make clear to the world. There are a thousand and
one doors. Only one single quality should be there – that</p><p>you are rejoicing in doing it, for no attainment. When a singer
sings, if he is singing for some reward he cannot be total.</p><p><br></p><p>I am reminded of one of India’s greatest singers, Tansen. Even today,
in Gwalior, there is his samadhi and singers from all over the country
go there on his birthday to pay their respects to that great genius. He
was in the court of a great emperor, Akbar, and Akbar could not conceive
that music could go higher or deeper than Tansen’s. But it became a
continuous question in his mind: Is it possible to transcend Tansen? Can
somebody do something more than he is doing?</p><p><br></p><p>Finally he asked Tansen himself: “This question has been torturing
me. I know that there is no one who can go so deep and create such
beautiful music. Thousands of musicians have come to the court; they
know the technique, but their totality is not in it.”</p><p><br></p><p>Tansen said, “Please forgive me. You don’t know my master – I am not
even dust under his feet. You don’t know what totality in music is.”</p><p><br></p><p>Akbar said, “Then invite your master to the court. We will give him
all the respect that is possible.”</p><p><br></p><p>Tansen said, “That is the difficulty; that’s why I have never
mentioned him.” He lived just near to where the Taj Mahal now stands.
“He is a very silent, poor man, but he never sings on demand. That is
the difficulty. You cannot call him and ask him to sing or play his
sitar. When it comes spontaneously to him, then it is a totally
different world – you will not be able even to compare me with him.”</p><p><br></p><p>Akbar said, “You are creating trouble. If he cannot be asked, then
how am I going to listen to him?”</p><p><br></p><p>Tansen said, “I know perfectly that at three o’clock, early in the
morning almost every day, he plays his sitar. What can be arranged is
that we should hide behind the trees where he lives in a hut by the side
of the Ganges and just listen as thieves. There is no other way. If he
becomes aware that somebody is there, he may stop. So be very quiet.”
And perhaps never in the history of man has any emperor like Akbar gone
to listen to a beggar.</p><p><br></p><p>His name was Haridas. In the middle of the night they were hiding
behind the trees like thieves. At three o’clock exactly, Haridas started
playing on his sitar, and Akbar wept for the first time. Returning home,
his tears continued.</p><p><br></p><p>Tansen said to him, “Now we are coming close to the palace. Wash away
your tears! Why are you weeping?”</p><p><br></p><p>Akbar said, “I am weeping because now my whole idea that you are the
greatest singer, the greatest musician in the world, is shattered. Your
master is miles beyond. But what is the reason that you cannot manage to
be the same as your master?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “The reason is clear: I sing and play for reward; he sings
and plays out of spontaneity, for no reward, with no desire even that
somebody should listen to it. Just out of his fullness, out of his
abundance he pours out music. I cannot do it. I am a court poet, a court
singer, a court musician: I do my best, but deep down there is a desire
for reward. And you have been rewarding me, you have</p><p>filled my house with gold. You have raised my position to being the
world’s greatest musician, but I know the greatest musician is a beggar
who was my master.</p><p><br></p><p>“I had to sit by his side for thirty years, because there was no
other way. He would not teach you anything – if you could learn that was
your business. He would play only when it came to him. You could watch,
you could see the tremendous splendor that suddenly happened. Haridas
disappeared, only the music remained.”</p><p><br></p><p>In those moments, when Haridas disappeared, he was a buddha whether
he knew it or not. The activity may be in any direction, any
dimension.</p><p><br></p><p>I want everybody to know that if you can do something without any
desire of reward or attainment, you are in meditation. You will blossom
into enlightenment. Out of your abundance will come love and compassion,
and for a few days you may walk differently from others. But soon you
will realize that others cannot recognize it – that is one thing.</p><p><br></p><p>And a second thing: it is ugly on your part, mean, to show your
enlightenment, to show your light to the people who are blind. It is not
compassionate. Soon the enlightened man forgets about his enlightenment.
That is The Great Matter – forgetting even enlightenment. The whole
world is gone and enlightenment too. Nothing remains behind, you have
become part of the universe.</p><p><br></p><p>This is rest. This is relaxation.</p><p><br></p><p>ENLIGHTENMENT IS THE WAY TO EXTINCTION. IF YOU TAKE PEACE AND QUIET
TO BE BLISS, ALL THINGS ARE AFFLICTIONS; BUT WHEN YOU ARE ENLIGHTENED,
ALL THINGS ARE ENLIGHTENMENT. PEOPLE OF THE WORLD DO NOT UNDERSTAND THIS
BASIS OF DELUSION AND ENLIGHTENMENT. THEY SUPPRESS THOUGHTS OF BIRTH AND
DEATH AND THINK THAT THIS IS THE NON-BIRTH OF A SINGLE THOUGHT, AND ALSO
CONSIDER THIS MINDLESSNESS – BUT THESE ARE STILL THOUGHTS OF BIRTH AND
DEATH, NOT MINDLESSNESS, NOT QUIESCENCE. WHEN YOU TRY TO STOP THOUGHT BY
THOUGHT, BIRTH AND DEATH CONTINUE.</p><p><br></p><p>You cannot stop thought with thought. You cannot control mind with
mind itself. You have to be aloof, out of the mind, just watching
it.</p><p><br></p><p>Perhaps for a few days it may make a little fuss, that “You have
deserted me!” Just go on watching. It will disappear because its
nourishment is your identification with it. Now that you are no longer
identified, it cannot last long. It will shrink, it will die out, it
will disappear like smoke in the sky, and only the watcher remains.</p><p><br></p><p>But when there is nothing to watch, even the purpose of the watcher
is not there. When there is nothing to watch, the watcher has committed
suicide without knowing it. That’s why he is saying, ENLIGHTENMENT IS
THE WAY TO EXTINCTION.</p><p><br></p><p>You will be extinguished, completely dissolved into the whole. Only
then will you find... you will not be there, but only peace, but only
light, but only joy, but only dance<span class=s4></span>The flower

IS YOURS,</p><p>LONG I HOVERED ON THE MIDDLE WAY,</p><p>TODAY THE VERY ICE SHOOTS FLAME.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha’s path is called The Middle Way; no extremes, just keep in the
middle.</p><p><br></p><p>TODAY THE VERY ICE SHOOTS FLAME. “I have come to the point where ice
and fire are in harmony, where everything is in harmony.” A better word
for harmony would be synchronicity – everything is in a deep
synchronicity, all hearts have become one heartbeat.</p><p><br></p><p>Another haiku runs:</p><p><br></p><p>EVER ONWARDS TO WHERE THE WATERS HAVE AN END:</p><p>WAITING MOTIONLESS FOR WHEN THE WHITE CLOUDS SHALL ARISE.</p><p>Meditation is just like the rivers running towards the ocean: when
they meet the ocean, they will disappear. They are running so fast to
their extinction.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddhism did not appeal much to the Indian priesthood, the brahmins,
for the simple reason that for centuries they have been praying to God
for rewards. All the VEDAS are full of asking God for this or that. The
whole mind of India was not prepared to accept Buddha. The conditioning
was, you pray, you make fire rituals, you sacrifice, and God will give
you great rewards. You do virtuous acts and in paradise you will be paid
a thousand times more.</p><p><br></p><p>This idea had been cultivated in India for thousands of years when
Buddha said that this is not true religion, this is sheer business, this
is not an authentic search for existence. You are still hankering for
rewards. Because of this he had chosen the word ‘nirvana’ for his
ultimate point.</p><p><br></p><p>Nirvana actually means blowing out a candle. When you blow out a
candle, can you say where the flame has gone? Can you find the flame
anywhere? It must have gone somewhere, but you know it is impossible to
find it. It has disappeared in the universe.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha used the word ‘nirvana’, which we are translating as
enlightenment; but the word ‘enlightenment’ does not carry the same
flavor of extinction. It still gives the idea of attainment. Nirvana
means seeking extinction, blowing out the candle in the cosmos.</p><p><br></p><p>Naturally, hundreds of times in his forty-two years of preaching,
great Hindu scholars, priests and philosophers approached Buddha and
asked him, “What is the point in striving for something in which you
will disappear?”</p><p><br></p><p>Question 1</p><p><br></p><p>Maneesha has asked a similar question:</p><p><br></p><p>OUR BELOVED MASTER,</p><p><br></p><p>NOBODY IN THEIR RIGHT MIND WOULD WANT TO BE EXTINGUISHED. SO WHO OR
WHAT IS IT INSIDE US THAT FEELS A PULL TOWARDS OBLITERATION?</p><p><br></p><p>It was absolutely right to ask Buddha, “Your teaching is strange:
meditating seems to be the ultimate suicide. Why should one desire
extinction?” But Buddha’s answer was very clear, although it was not
received by the Indian mind.</p><p><br></p><p>His answer was very clear. He said, “Because you are the problem;
hence extinction is the only solution.”</p><p><br></p><p>It is not that you have problems; this has to be understood very
clearly. It is not that you have problems, so problems can be solved
separately and you can be saved. If that were the situation, then Buddha
would have been wrong. But this is not the situation. You are the
problem. You cannot be without problems.</p><p><br></p><p>Just think that one morning you wake up and you don’t have any
problems – you will be in such grief. You will say, “My God, what am I
going to do? No problems at all!”</p><p>You cling to problems because problems give you personality. They
give you a certain identity.</p><p><br></p><p>Without problems, you are no more. You are just a collection of
problems. That’s why Buddha is right, that meditation is the extinction
not only of problems but of you too, because you were nothing but a
collection, a name for a collection of problems. When all the problems
are gone, you are gone... you are not separate from your problems.
Buddha’s greatest contribution to the world was the realization that man
himself is the problem. You may go on changing problems – that is
possible – but you cannot exist without problems. There is no need! If
you don’t have any problem, what is the point of existing?</p><p><br></p><p>Psychologists now say that after retirement, people lose almost ten
years of life. If they had remained working they would have lived ten
years more, but because they got retired... They had been hankering for
years to be retired so they could go on a world tour or visit ancient
palaces, castles, the Himalayas. They will enjoy, life will be fun. Up
to now life has been just work, work, work. After retirement they can
enjoy life as fun.</p><p><br></p><p>But after retirement they find that life has become absolutely
useless. Nobody needs them. Their children are grown up, they have gone
their way. And even if they tour around the world...</p><p><br></p><p>I have seen tourists with all kinds of cameras and bags and machinery
covering both their sides, but look at their faces! They know that they
are unnecessarily running from the Taj Mahal to Ajanta, from Ajanta to
Ellora. They know perfectly well that all this is useless; they are
simply keeping themselves engaged in something which is futile. Now
death seems to be the only release. Naturally their lifespan
shrinks.</p><p><br></p><p>What Gautam Buddha is saying is a very ultimate answer to man. He
says that you are the problem. It does not matter what shape the problem
takes – unless you are ready to extinguish yourself, the problem will go
on coming in new forms. Youth has its problems, childhood has its
problems; the child wants quickly to grow up.</p><p><br></p><p>I have been talking to small children. They all want to grow up
quickly because they see that others are enjoying – smoking cigarettes,
going to the movies, having girlfriends. They want to grow as quickly as
possible.</p><p><br></p><p>Once I used to live by the side of a post office, and I used to go
early, at three o’clock in the morning, for a walk. One night I saw a
little boy. It was a full-moon night, so I could figure out who he was;
he was the postmaster’s son. And seeing me, he hid himself behind a
tree.</p><p><br></p><p>I got hold of him and I asked, “What is the matter? Why are you
hiding? Just come out.” He said, “I will come out, but don’t tell my
daddy.”</p><p>I said, “What is the problem, that you are trying to hide?”</p><p><br></p><p>He was hiding an artificial mustache, and a cigarette. He was
pretending to be his father. He was walking the same way as his father
walked.<span class=s4></span>He said, “Just don’t tell him, otherwise
he will give me</p><p>a good beating.”</p><p>I said, “What is the hurry? Someday the mustache will grow, and then
you can smoke cigarettes also. It is too soon.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I have been waiting and waiting and everybody seems to be
enjoying and I have to go on playing with toys. Whenever I make a fuss
my father brings another toy. How long do I have to be with toys? I want
real things!”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “You can have real toys.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I have! I can show you in my house, you come with me. I
have a beautiful girl who opens her eyes and if you lie her down she
closes her eyes. But after all it is only a toy! – it is not a real
girlfriend.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “That’s true!”</p><p><br></p><p>Small children have their problems. When they grow up, they have
their problems. The same girlfriends, the same boyfriends that they had
wanted become a nightmare, nagging each other, torturing each other,
doing everything nasty to each other and still holding together. It is
very difficult to get rid of your torturer, because deep down you also
feel alone if nobody tortures you.</p><p><br></p><p>The Hindu shastras say that you have to beat your woman once a week
absolutely; otherwise she will think you don’t love her. I think there
is something in it! If you don’t beat your girlfriend, she will beat
you. It is up to you to choose.</p><p><br></p><p>George Bernard Shaw used to say that giving women equality is
impossible. When asked why he said, “My lifelong experience” – and
nobody has lived so long as he has lived, he almost made a century – “My
experience is, either you keep the woman down with force or she will
keep you down. Equality is not possible. Either you are superior or she
is superior. One of you has to be inferior at any cost.”</p><p><br></p><p>Equality is impossible, according to George Bernard Shaw, and I can
see the point. It is always difficult.</p><p><br></p><p>So when you are young you have your troubles and you want to get out
of this troubled age quickly, but problems remain.</p><p><br></p><p>As old age starts coming one becomes afraid, because old age means
death is not far away. And old age means the younger generation around
you is no longer interested in you. You are too old, too out of fashion.
You cannot mix with the younger generation, they avoid you. You are
finished; just understand the point that you are finished. All your
false teeth won’t help.</p><p><br></p><p>There are people around who have everything false, and they are
thinking to deceive younger people. But how long can you deceive? – in
the night you have to take out your false teeth. One day you may not be
observed, but the second day... while sleeping your false hair falls
from your skull, and the woman who is lying beside you cannot believe
that you have been deceiving her! But everything seems to be false.</p><p>There is an age where false things are needed; otherwise you are
out-of-date. But what are you doing here? Just go to your graves!
Meditate there! The world has left you alone. Old age... and death seems
to be knocking at any moment on your door, and the fear of the
unknown... Your whole life is a problem.</p><p><br></p><p>From the very birth the child resists coming out of the womb because
he has lived for nine months in a most comfortable, most luxurious
place. No work, and every need is automatically provided – why should he
leave this place? And who knows what is outside? That is why women have
so much trouble giving birth to a child: the child clings, the child
does not want to come out. From that moment, up to when you are put on a
funeral pyre, you are just trouble – to yourself and to others.</p><p><br></p><p>Maneesha, that is the need, the desire, for ultimate annihilation,
dissolving into the universe – so that you don’t have any personal
needs, any personal problems; so that you don’t have any burden, not
even of being, because being is also a burden.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha’s insight is so great that he is still ahead of his time. Even
though twenty-five centuries have passed, he has not yet found his
contemporaries, because what he is saying is so ultimately true that it
hurts, that one wants not to see it, to close one’s eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>It was for this reason that Buddhism could not grow in India –
because India’s mind was, for centuries, cultivated with the idea that
prayer, meditation, yoga, everything is for a reward.</p><p><br></p><p>And Buddha says, “If you have any idea of reward, you will miss. The
very idea of attaining something will prevent you from merging into
existence.” It was so contrary to people’s minds that only a few very
intelligent people followed him. And after he died, within three hundred
years... just three hundred years after his death, not even a ripple
remained. In India, Buddhism has completely disappeared.</p><p><br></p><p>Three hundred years later Alexander the Great came to India. He
wanted to meet some Buddhist saints, but he could not. He could not find
any. Why did it disappear so quickly, such a great insight? The reason
is, the Indian mind is basically greedy. It talks about renunciation,
but even renunciation is for a reward. It talks about charity, but
charity is also for a reward. Everything is business.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddhism managed to grow its roots in China, in Korea, in Japan, in
Thailand, for the simple reason that they were not so-called religious
people. China was under the great impact of Confucius, who did not
believe in God, who did not believe in any heaven or any hell. Buddhism
found the right ground where people were not asking for attainment, even
after death. And Japan was even more fertile a land; they did not have
the Indian greed.</p><p><br></p><p>It is very strange that India continues to claim to the whole world
that it is the only spiritual land. It is all cow dung. I have lived for
half a century, and I have watched the Indian mind from all sides – they
are more greedy than any people in the world, but they have made even
their greed spirituality.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha could not make his roots here for the simple reason that the
Indian mind was already prejudiced and prepared for having great
pleasures beyond death. It could not lose those pleasures. And
naturally, to the mind, the question that Maneesha is asking arises.</p><p>“Nobody in their right mind” – that is true... “Nobody in their right
mind would want to be extinguished.”</p><p><br></p><p>But who is there who is in their right mind? In fact, when you are in
your right mind, you would love to be extinguished. Only the insane want
to continue. What is the point? Just think for a moment: before you were
born, do you think there was something missing in the world? And think
again: when you will be dead, do you think something will be missing in
the world? Millions of people have come and gone – the world
continues.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha is saying: Birth is pain, youth is pain, old age is pain,
death is pain – why do you want to continue? For what? His meditation is
a search for dissolving oneself back into the cosmos. It is total rest,
rest from yourself; total freedom, freedom even from yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>This is one of the reasons I am not part of India. Those who have
come to me from all over the world are not greedy people. They really
want to understand that life is a problem, that mind is a problem. In
fact, to be is to be a problem. Then why not be courageous and not
be?</p><p><br></p><p>You will find very few Indians here; they are all against me. Again
they find another buddha teaching annihilation, extinction, teaching
ultimate death. But only very intelligent people can understand it.
Buddhism is for the most sophisticated, for the most intelligent. It is
not for the ordinary people, for the mediocre. They will go on
suffering, but they will never understand that their very being is
suffering. Non-being is the freedom from suffering.</p><p><br></p><p>A few laughs before you disappear, die, extinguish... and this time
really go. At least for a few moments you will be a buddha, and there is
no harm if you don’t come back. We will still celebrate – it is a
promise.</p><p><br></p><p>Dilly and Dally, two salesmen, are standing together at the bar,
talking about football. At the other end of the bar an old drunk is
having trouble holding himself and his drink upright at the same
time.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly Dilly notices a very unpleasant smell. “Hey, Dally!” he
says, “do you smell shit?”</p><p>Dally sniffs the air, nods and starts to hold his nose.</p><p><br></p><p>“I think it’s coming from that old drunk over there,” he says.</p><p><br></p><p>“Excuse me,” says Dally to the old guy, “but there is a terrible
smell around here. Did you shit in your pants?”</p><p><br></p><p>The bleary-eyed drunk lifts up his head and stares at Dilly. “Yup,”
he slobbers, “what about it?”</p><p>“Well,” says a shocked Dilly, “why don’t you go to the bathroom and
wash yourself?”</p><p><br></p><p>The old drunk stares back, blinking, and then says, “Because I
haven’t finished yet!”</p><p>Three secretaries, Betty, Boopsee and Barbara, are working in the
same office for the same boss, the famous male chauvinist tyrant,
Dumford Porkeye.</p><p><br></p><p>“He is so mean,” says Betty to Boopsee and Barbara on their coffee
break, “so yesterday I put salt in his sugar bowl just to watch his face
when he drank his coffee.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s nothing,” says Boopsee. “I found a pack of condoms in his
desk drawer and took a pin and put holes in the ends of all them!”</p><p><br></p><p>At that moment, Barbara fainted.</p><p><br></p><p>Donald Dixteen is touring Spain. He is looking at the boats in the
harbor of a small fishing village, when Old Carlos comes over to him and
asks, “How many boats do you see there in the water?”</p><p><br></p><p>“About twenty-five,” replies Donald.</p><p><br></p><p>“Twenty-eight, in fact!” says Carlos. “And I built every one of them
with my own hands! But do my neighbors call me Carlos the boat builder?
They do not! How many houses do you see on the hillside over there?”
continues Carlos.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thirty-two,” replies Donald.</p><p><br></p><p>“Correct!” agrees Carlos, “all built by me. But do my neighbors call
me Carlos the house-builder? They do not!</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, what do they call you?” insists Donald. “Carlos the what?”
“What do they call me?” exclaims Carlos, eyeing a nearby hen
lovingly.</p><p>“You wouldn’t believe it,” explains Carlos, “just because of that one
little chicken I fucked!” Nivedano...</p><p>(Drumbeat) (Gibberish) Nivedano... (Drumbeat)</p><p>Be silent, close your eyes. Feel your body to be frozen.</p><p>Gather your consciousness inwards,</p><p><br></p><p>deeper and deeper.…</p><p>This silence, this peace, this blissfulness discovers the buddha
within you.</p><p>For these few moments you are a buddha and it is up to you, if you
can remember – then you can be a buddha twenty-four hours. ‘Buddha’
simply means silent awareness.</p><p>And the silent awareness is not something dead, it is full of
joy,</p><p>it is full of juice, it is full of dance.</p><p>It has a music of its own.</p><p><br></p><p>To make it more clear, Nivedano... (Drumbeat)</p><p>Relax.…</p><p><br></p><p>Relax into the universe.</p><p><br></p><p>Drop yourself, with all your problems. Just don’t be!</p><p>This is transcending even the buddha. This is entering into the
cosmos itself, losing all your personality, individuality. The dewdrop
slipping from the lotus leaf into the ocean...</p><p>This is the most blissful</p><p><br></p><p>and ecstatic moment of your life.</p><p>Continue to remember it. It is your own nature.</p><p>It is not something uncommon, it is not something extraordinary,</p><p>it is just pure nature, simply very ordinary, without any claim to
anything.</p><p>This brings so much light and so much delight that it starts
overflowing in you.</p><p>Nivedano... (Drumbeat)</p><p>Come back, but don’t come back leaving your experience behind – bring
it with you.</p><p>Slowly, gracefully resurrect.</p><p><br></p><p>Sit for a few seconds as buddhas, collecting,</p><p>remembering where you have been... the experience...</p><p>so that it becomes an undercurrent in your life twenty-four hours a

infectious.</p><p>Share it, don’t be a miser!</p><p>Okay, Maneesha?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, Beloved Master.</p><p><br></p><p>Can we celebrate the ten thousand buddhas? Yes, Beloved Master.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part3>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

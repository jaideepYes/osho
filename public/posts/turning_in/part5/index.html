SUPERNORMAL POWERS, KNOWLEDGE, WISDOM AND VIRTUE, ALL ARISE FROM HERE. THE PATH OF LIFE OF HUMANS AND GODS OPENS HEREIN; ALL THE BUDDHAS HAVE ENTERED AND LEFT BY THIS DOOR. BODHISATTVAS PRACTICING IT HAVE ENTERED THIS DOOR. DISCIPLES AND SELF-ENLIGHTENED ONES ARE STILL ONLY HALFWAY THERE, WHILE OUTSIDERS, THOUGH THEY PRACTICE, DO NOT ENTER THE RIGHT PATH. WHATEVER ESOTERIC OR EXOTERIC SCHOOLS DO NOT PRACTICE THIS, DO NOT HAVE ANYONE WHO REALIZES THE WAY OF BUDDHAHOOD.”\nA MONK THEN ASKED DAIKAKU, “WHAT DOES IT MEAN THAT SITTING MEDITATION IS THE ROOT SOURCE OF ALL THE TEACHINGS?” DAIKAKU ANSWERED, “MEDITATION IS THE INNER NO-MIND OF THE ENLIGHTENED ONES; DISCIPLINE IS THEIR OUTER CHARACTER; DOCTRINE IS THEIR SPEECH; BUDDHA-REMEMBRANCE IS THE INVOCATION OF THE BUDDHA’S NAME. ALL COME FROM THE ENLIGHTENED NO-MIND OF THE BUDDHAS; THEREFORE, IT IS CONSIDERED FUNDAMENTAL.”\nTHE MONK ASKED AGAIN, “THE METHOD OF MEDITATION IS FORMLESS AND THOUGHTLESS; SPIRITUAL QUALITIES ARE NOT OBVIOUS, AND THERE IS NO PROOF OF SEEING REALITY – SO HOW CAN WE BELIEVE IN THIS?”\nDAIKAKU SAID, “YOUR OWN NO-MIND AND THE ENLIGHTENED NO-MIND ARE ONE – IS THAT NOT SPIRITUAL QUALITY? IF YOU DON’T KNOW YOUR OWN NO-MIND, ON WHOM CAN YOU CALL FOR WITNESS AND PROOF? OTHER THAN THE IDENTITY OF NO-MIND AND BUDDHA, WHAT PROOF DO YOU SEEK?”\nManeesha, Daikaku is making some very important statements for those who are on the path; not for those who are seeking knowledge, respectability, reputation. Daikaku is a master only if you are a seeker. Unless your whole life depends on a single point of finding your own center, the very source of your being, you will not be able to understand what Daikaku is saying.\nBut this assembly is no ordinary crowd. This assembly is of the bodhisattvas, who are essentially buddhas, and their urge to explore their inner reality to its totality has brought them from all corners of the world. This is the right assembly for a man like Daikaku.\nDAIKAKU SAID TO HIS ASSEMBLY OF MONKS:\nSITTING MEDITATION IS THE METHOD OF GREAT LIBERATION.\nIt is very strange that just by silently sitting, watching your thoughts moving here and there as if they do not belong to you – you don’t have to do anything about them, not even make a judgment – just sitting silently not doing anything, and the door opens. Your ultimate reality is not something to be sought in the outside world; it is hidden in the seeker himself. The moment you start looking for it here and there, you are going far away, far away from yourself. There is no need to go anywhere. Just sit down, settle down. The mind is just like dust in water. If you are patient enough, the dust will settle and the crystal-clear water will be there reflecting the full moon.\nZen does not preach any discipline, any doctrine, any practice. It is one of the greatest blessings to humanity that Zen has made the search for oneself so obvious and so simple.\nSITTING MEDITATION IS THE METHOD OF GREAT LIBERATION; ALL THE TEACHINGS FLOW FORTH FROM THIS; MYRIAD PRACTICES ARE MASTERED THIS WAY. SUPERNORMAL POWERS, KNOWLEDGE, WISDOM AND VIRTUE, ALL ARISE FROM HERE. THE PATH OF LIFE OF HUMANS AND GODS OPENS HEREIN; ALL THE BUDDHAS HAVE ENTERED AND LEFT BY THIS DOOR.\nThese sentences have to be remembered. While sitting silently you will come across a door within you, just an opening. If you remain in this opening, still, many things will start happening to you: knowledge, wisdom, some miraculous powers, great virtue – but this is only the door.\nA few are sitting outside the door; they can sit as long as they want. They are exoteric people who cannot look in, who always look out. They have become obsessed with the outside reality. They are also sitting by the side of the door. But their back is towards the door, not their face.\nThe disciple is also sitting, but his face is towards the door. But this is only a door to a tremendous phenomenon of existence. You are not to stop here, although it will allure you with great wisdom, miraculous powers, virtues. It will bring you peace and silence.\nBut Daikaku says, ALL THE BUDDHAS HAVE ENTERED AND LEFT BY THIS DOOR.\nThere is something more beyond this door. The buddhas have entered and left the door behind. They have gone beyond.\nWhat is beyond knowledge? – innocence. What is beyond wisdom? – just a sense that “I know nothing.” What is beyond miracles? – no buddha has done a miracle.\nBuddha did not walk on water and did not turn water into wine and did not make any Lazarus come back to life. Compared to Jesus he has not done anything, but he is far beyond Jesus. Jesus is only at the door; he has not entered into the ultimate reality. Buddha cannot do any miracle for the simple reason that he is no more. He cannot be knowledgeable because he has dropped himself, like a dewdrop from the lotus leaf into the ocean. His let-go is so total that a tremendous energy field is created around him in which anything may happen; but he is not the doer.\nI would like to show you the difference. Lazarus died – he was a friend of Jesus, and a follower. His sisters were followers of Jesus. They wouldn’t allow the town’s people to bury the dead man. Jesus was informed; he was far away. It took four days, and when he came, the dead body of Lazarus was being kept in a cave in the mountains. He called, “Lazarus! Come out!” and Lazarus came out. This is thought to be the greatest miracle of Jesus.\nA similar situation arose before Buddha, but the story is totally different. A woman was going to drown herself, but people saved her somehow. Her husband had died but she had a small child, so she thought to live for the child. But then the child died; now there was nothing for her to live for. People said, “Don’t be worried, Buddha is in the town. You come with us, bring the dead body of the child. And if he cannot make him alive, then nobody can do anything.”\nThe woman came crying, weeping, carrying the body of the dead child. Buddha said, “Leave the child here. I will bring him back to life on one condition: you have to bring some mustard seeds from a house where nobody has ever died.”\nThe poor woman could not understand the logic of it. She thought, “What a great opportunity! This is not difficult” – because mustard seed was the principal crop in that village. “There must be some house where nobody has died.” She went from house to house.\nAnd they said, “How many mustard seeds do you want? We can bring many carts full if your child can be revived. But it won’t help, because not only one person but thousands of people must have died in this house, in this family. And you are unnecessarily wasting your time – you cannot find a house where nobody has died.”\nBut she went on searching – perhaps... a hope against hope. By the evening it became clear that everybody who is born dies, and she could not find the required mustard seeds. But her tears disappeared, and instead of tears a great awareness arose, that “Life and death exist together. And what does it matter if my child dies today or tomorrow? He would have to die, and it is good that he has died before me. If I had died first he would have been an orphan, a beggar. This is a great blessing.”\nBy the time she reached Buddha the sun was setting, and Buddha said, “Where are the mustard seeds?”\nShe fell down at Buddha’s feet and she said, “I have brought myself, not the mustard seeds. I want to be initiated into the search for that which never dies.”\nNow you can see the difference between the two stories. In one Lazarus is resurrected, but he will have to die again. What was the point of resurrecting him? He has not been transformed. He has not gained any insight, he has not become awakened. But this woman in a similar situation with a great master, encounters the very basic problem: how to transcend life and death? How to get beyond this circle of life and death?\nBuddha initiated her, and he said, “For this reason I had to send you – so that the understanding arose on your own that everybody dies. Now the question is, is there something that never dies? And I am happy that you have come back with that understanding. Your initiation is not an imitation, your initiation is out of understanding.”\nChristian missionaries continuously go on saying that except for Jesus, nobody – neither Buddha nor Bodhidharma... there have been thousands of masters, but Jesus is unique because of his miracles. But buddhas will laugh.\nThe real miracle is that the woman has come to an understanding that she wants to enter into herself. From the outside you may not think it a great miracle. To resurrect the body is not the question – he will die again, you are simply giving him another chance to die.\nEven Christian scholars are finding all the miracles of Jesus unfounded. They have been added three hundred years after Jesus, to give him a glamor that he is really the son of God. All pure fiction!\nNow there is a great controversy going on in Christian circles: can we accept Jesus if his miracles are proved fictitious? Take away the miracles and Jesus is nothing. But take anything away from Gautam Buddha, he is still a Gautam Buddha. You cannot take away anything from him because nothing is added. He has remained simply himself, no fiction, no mythology. This is a real miracle, that a man who influenced the whole East also managed that nobody add any mythology, any fiction to his life. His life has remained a pure flame without any smoke.\nALL THE BUDDHAS HAVE ENTERED AND LEFT... This is only a door. It is not a place to live, it is simply a passage to pass through.AND LEFT BY THIS DOOR.\nBODHISATTVAS PRACTICING IT HAVE ENTERED THIS DOOR. DISCIPLES AND SELF- ENLIGHTENED ONES ARE STILL ONLY HALFWAY THERE WHILE OUTSIDERS, THOUGH THEY PRACTICE, DO NOT ENTER THE RIGHT PATH.\nIf you are doing some practice outside, that means you are doing some yoga exercise, distorting the body this way and that way, standing on your head. And nobody ever thinks, “Is self-realization a certain posture of the body?” You can go on standing on your head for your whole life but still you will not become enlightened; you will just become a very fat head. All the blood will accumulate in your head, your hands and legs will slowly start shrinking. Certainly you will not be a human being anymore, but just a big football with small hands and legs. It is a miracle, but what can you do with such a miracle?\nThis statement, DISCIPLES AND SELF-ENLIGHTENED ONES ARE STILL ONLY HALFWAY\nTHERE... They have not even reached the door.\nIt will be a little difficult to distinguish between the enlightened one and the self-enlightened. The self-enlightened is only imagining that he is enlightened. Nobody can prevent you from imagining any kind of thing you want. And nobody can refute you, because there is no way to refute and there is no way to argue for or against.\nI have heard about a madman who got the idea that he was dead. Madness was not enough, he added something more. He would say, “I know that I am dead.”\nPeople said, “Don’t say such things; you are talking, you are walking, you are eating.”\nHe said, “So what? That does not prove that I am not dead. I have seen many dead people doing the same thing. What do you think about yourself?” Then people thought that this was very dangerous: if their families heard that this fellow thought that everybody is dead, and talking and eating and walking do not matter; you are dead and it can continueThey took him to a psychiatrist who said,\n“Don’t be worried. I will cure him.”\nThey said, “We are not worried about him, we are worried about you – because he has cured many people. A few of his friends have started having another thought, that perhaps they are dead. He is very convincing, a very logical and rational person.”\nThe psychiatrist said, “You go and leave him with me.”\nTo the madman the psychiatrist said, “Have you heard that dead men don’t bleed?” He said, “Yes, when I was alive I had heard it, I remember.”\nThen the psychiatrist said, “The matter is settled.”\nHe took out his knife and cut a little on the mad fellow’s hand and blood came out. The madman said, “Aha! That means that proverb is wrong: dead men do bleed. Now give me the knife, I will try it on you.”\nThe psychiatrist said, “You will try it on me?”\nHe said, “I have to know whether you are alive or dead. Now it is proved that dead people bleed. If you are dead, you will bleed. If you are still alive you will not bleed. Just give me your hand.”\nHe said, “My God, your family was right.”\nThe madman took his hand and made a good cut and said, “Look! We both are dead. Everybody is dead. I have not come across a single person who is alive. But everybody is deluded – what can you do?”\nThe psychiatrist said, “Please don’t tell anybody else that I am dead. You just go home.”\nHe said, “Which home? I am coming with you. Behave like a dead man – graceful, silent, friendly. I can help your practice very much: every day I can have a table in your office. Difficult patients that you cannot treat, I can treat within a minute. It just has to be proved that they are dead. And a dead person cannot worry, a dead person cannot dream; they are just befooling themselves. A dead person needs no psychiatry.”\nDaikaku is saying, BODHISATTVAS PRACTICING IT HAVE ENTERED THIS DOOR.\nThey have not stopped at the door, they have passed through it. There is every allurement to remain at the door because you suddenly feel immensely powerful, capable of doing miracles.\nBut a real seeker is not in search of miracles, he is in search of the source of his life from where everything arises.\nBODHISATTVAS PRACTICING IT HAVE ENTERED THE DOOR, left the door behind, become buddhas. Their miracle is their love, their miracle is their compassion. Their miracle is to spread buddhahood like a wildfire.\nMaking wine out of water is not a miracle, it is a crime. Don’t do any such thing here. If Jesus had made wine into water, that was perfectly natural, there was no crime in it. But making wine out of water is certainly dangerous. But whether dangerous or not, it is trivia, not a miracle.\nThe only miracle is to be authentic, honest, yourself. And then anything that follows around you, in your field, is not your doing. So those who are of great understanding that their ultimate aim is to search for the buddha within, they have entered the door.\nDISCIPLES AND SELF-ENLIGHTENED – this is a category of mad people – ARE STILL ONLY HALFWAY THERE,\nWHILE OUTSIDERS, THOUGH THEY PRACTICE, DO NOT ENTER THE RIGHT PATH.\nThose who are outside can go on doing austerities, self-torture, fasts and all kinds of things, but they will not enter. And those who have only half entered will remain clinging to the door. And the door is not the reality; you have to pass through it, beyond.…\nIn other words, the door is the mind and the beyond is the no-mind – and that is the only miracle worth calling a miracle.\nWHATEVER ESOTERIC OR EXOTERIC SCHOOLS DO NOT PRACTICE THIS, DO NOT HAVE ANYONE WHO REALIZES THE WAY OF BUDDHAHOOD.\nAll esoteric schools are just hallucinatory, playing on the imagination of man with all good intentions, but they are not the path to know the truth, to know the source of life. And the exoteric who are doing outward thingsFor example, they drop their clothes, and they think because they have become\nnaked they have attained great virtue.\nOne cannot imagine the blindness of man. All the animals are naked – except for a few English dogs. Some old ladies in England still cover their dogs. When they take the dog for a walk they\ngo on pulling their leashes, particularly to keep him from making any tree or lamppost a toilet. Or he may come across a girlfriend... to prevent him from enjoying a love affair, they go on pulling the leash. And the dogs have to be covered, because naked dogs remind them of pornography. These women are really pornographic! England has a few specialties; one of these specialties is these old women. Even today they are afraid to leave their dogs, or even their chair legs or table legs naked, because that is pornographic. Now, who is pornographic? – these women, in their imagination.\nI have heard about three old men, great friends, all retired. One was sixty-five, another was seventy- five, and the third was eighty-five. One evening when they were meeting in the park, a daily routine, they found the youngest, the sixty-five-year-old, looking very sad. They asked, “What is the problem? You can tell us. We have been friends for years.”\nHe said, “I am so ashamed. But I have to tell you that I was looking through the keyhole of the bathroom when a beautiful woman, who was a guest in my house, was taking her bath.”\nThe other two laughed and said, “You idiot, everybody has done that. It is nothing special.”\nThe man said, “You have not heard the whole story. I was caught red-handed and my mother slapped me.”\nThose two old fellows again said, “Don’t be worried – every child does it. And it is very rare to find a mother who does not slap.”\nThat sixty-five-year-old man said, “You don’t understand – it is not a question of childhood, it happened today!”\nThey said, “Then it is certainly serious, but not much to be worried about.”\nThe seventy-five-year-old then said, “My problem is more difficult. Whenever I make any approach to my wife, she simply turns over and says, ‘I am suffering from a great headache. Don’t bother me!’ Years have passed. I have already forgotten how to make love.”\nThe third man laughed. He said, “You are also of the same category. Think about my problem. This morning my wife started beating me.”\nThey said, “This is serious. What happened?”\nHe said, “I was just preparing to make love, and she started beating me and told me, ‘You idiot! The whole night, three times, you have already made love. Neither do you sleep nor do you allow me to sleep.’”\nThe other two fellows laughed and said, “It seems he is losing his memory. Otherwise at this age, four times... unbelievable!” They said, “You consult some psychologist. You are simply losing your memory.”\nThe only grown-up-ness is not of age: you may be eighty-five and still an old goat. Goats don’t grow wiser, they simply grow older. The only path to wisdom goes inwards.\nThat’s why no other animal except man can know himself, because no other animal has any idea at all of the inner. Everything is outer. You become a man when you become aware that there is something inner. And it has to be searched for vigorously, because life is not certain – at any moment death may destroy the opportunity.\nA MONK THEN ASKED DAIKAKU, “WHAT DOES IT MEAN THAT SITTING MEDITATION IS THE ROOT SOURCE OF ALL THE TEACHINGS?”\nIt looks very simple; that’s why it creates questions. Just say to somebody, “Sit silently and everything will happen,” and he will think you are mad: “You have to do something for something to happen.”\nOne great American writer, Napoleon Hill, has written a book, THINK AND GROW RICH – just think. I thought, he seems to be a Zen master, because they say, “Sit and find the buddha.” This fellow is saying, “Think and grow rich.” Just think, with closed eyes, that a Lincoln Continental is standing in your porch: if you think really hard, you will find it.\nHe seems to be a very articulate writer, very convincing, that this whole world is your idea. Whatever you think happens. Think of money and money will start coming; think of a beautiful woman and you will hear a knock on the door, but the basic requirement is first to believe. If you don’t believe, nothing is going to happen. That condition is tricky. If the Lincoln Continental does not arise in your porch, you know your belief is not strong enough to pull that big a car. If instead of a very beautiful woman a very ugly woman knocks on the door you know that Napoleon Hill is right, but your belief staggered, wavered; and this ugly lady is the result.\nIt happened that the day Napoleon Hill’s book was published – in America the writers promote their books – he was standing in the bookstore where the book was released and he was signing books for the first buyers. By chance, Henry Ford came to look for some books and he saw this fellow autographing. He asked the owner of the shop, “Who is this fellow, and what is he doing here?”\nHe told him, “He is a great writer and his book is selling like hot cakes. It is a great book. Just seeing the name, you will be surprised. Think of purchasing it. It is called, THINK AND GROW RICH.”\nHenry Ford was a very clever, cunning fellow. He went to Napoleon Hill, looking at him from up to down, from down to up, and asked, “Have you come in your own car or on a public bus?”\nNapoleon Hill said, “What kind of question is that? I am answering questions about my book.” Henry Ford said, “It is about your book.”\nHe said, “I have come on the public bus.”\nHenry Ford said, “That shows that your book is a fraud. You don’t even have your own car. Can’t you think? I am Henry Ford and this is my address. So when you have your own car, come to me and I will purchase your book. But get the car by thinking, not by any other means.”\nPoor Napoleon Hill was so shocked, and could not say anything in answer.\nThere have been many movements like this in the world, particularly in Christian countries. There is a movement called Christian Science which believes that whatever you believe happens – just believe it totally. They have their churches in all the great cities where they meet and read their literature, and enforce each other’s belief, nourish each other with their own experiences, encourage each other to believe and it will happen. People return from their meetings full of joy, “Now I am going to really believe and really think for something great to happen.”\nThe movement died, by and by; it had to die because it was so stupid.\nOne young man was encountered by an old woman who asked, “Your father is a regular member of our church, science and Christianity combined, but I have not seen him for two or three weeks. Where is he?”\nThe young man said, “He is sick, very sick.”\nThe old woman said, “All nonsense! He simply believes that he is sick. Just tell him to think, ‘I am healthy. Who says I am sick?’ Go home immediately!”\nThe boy was not a Christian Scientist; he giggled at this old woman. His father was really sick, but he said, “I will tell him your message.”\nAfter a few weeks again they met and again the old woman said, “What happened? Did you tell your father?”\nHe said, “I told him, but now he thinks he is dead. It has been almost one week – everything is finished. We all tried, and he tried to think that everything is going great...”\nBy thinking you cannot reach anywhere. That’s why in Zen the question arises again and again.\nA MONK ASKED DAIKAKU, “WHAT DOES IT MEAN THAT SITTING MEDITATION IS THE ROOT SOURCE OF ALL THE TEACHINGS?”\nDAIKAKU ANSWERED, “MEDITATION IS THE INNER NO-MIND.”\nBy sitting he does not mean that you sit and think about a Lincoln Continental. Sitting in Zen means simply sitting and doing nothing, not even thinking, not even chanting a mantra; creating a silent space where even you are not, just a pure mirror reflecting nothing.\nMEDITATION IS THE INNER NO-MIND OF THE ENLIGHTENED ONES; DISCIPLINE IS THEIR OUTER CHARACTER.\nWhat you see as discipline is really their manifestation of meditation in the outside world. A buddha walks in a certain way, talks in a certain way, looks in a certain way. All his gestures have a quality of buddhahood, of awareness.\nBut you cannot reverse the sequence: you cannot first discipline yourself and hope that by disciplining yourself you will become a buddha. First you have to become a buddha; discipline\ncomes on its own accord. And that discipline which comes spontaneously is the only right discipline. Otherwise, everything is torture.\nDISCIPLINE IS THEIR OUTER CHARACTER; DOCTRINE IS THEIR SPEECH.\nWhatever they say comes from the very source of life. The source is not the great scriptures, the source is their own experience. Hence, whatever they say is their doctrine.\nBUDDHA-REMEMBRANCE IS THE INVOCATION OF THE BUDDHA’S NAME.\nThere have been many Zen masters who would wake up in the morning and the first thing they would ask.For example, Obaku used to ask every morning, “Obaku, are you still here?”\nAnd his disciples would say, “If outsiders listen to it they will think you are mad. Why do you do it?”\nAnd he would say, “Because in the night I forget completely... a silent mind with no dreams, no thoughts. When I wake up I have to remind myself again that Obaku is still here. Who can I ask? I can ask only myself, ‘Obaku are you still here?’”\nAnd he himself would say, “Yes, sir.”\nOne has to have a deep respect towards oneself. It would be a good discipline for you. Rather than repeating the names of Rama and Krishna, it would be a great discipline for you just to ask yourself your own name: “Devageet, are you still here?” Don’t bother that Raj may be listening. And say, “Yes, sir.”\nAnd all of you, if you can do this much, you will be surprised what a great silence follows when you say, “Devageet, are you still here?” and you yourself say, “Yes, sir.” Then there follows a great silence. And it is also a remembrance of your own being, also a respectfulness, a gratitude that one day more is given to you, that again the sun will rise, that again for one day at least, you will be able to see the roses blossom.\nA man of no-mind, a man of meditation, finds himself so grateful for each moment that life gives to him. There is no reason – you don’t deserve it, nobody deserves it. It is a sheer gift of life. You cannot ask to extend your life even by a single moment. You cannot say, “I am worthy, so let me have a few more years; I deserve it.”\nNobody deserves. But life goes on pouring in you out of its abundance.\nALL COME FROM THE ENLIGHTENED NO-MIND OF THE BUDDHAS; THEREFORE, IT IS CONSIDERED FUNDAMENTAL.\nTHE MONK ASKED AGAIN, “THE METHOD OF MEDITATION IS FORMLESS AND THOUGHTLESS; SPIRITUAL QUALITIES ARE NOT OBVIOUS, AND THERE IS NO PROOF OF SEEING REALITY – SO HOW CAN WE BELIEVE IN THIS?”\nDAIKAKU SAID, “YOUR OWN NO-MIND AND THE ENLIGHTENED NO-MIND ARE ONE – IS THAT NOT SPIRITUAL QUALITY?”\nWhat Daikaku is saying is that your mind, minus your thoughts, is the no-mind of the buddha. And do you think it is not a spiritual quality? Because out of this no-mind will arise truthfulness, integration, compassion, all kinds of virtues and love.\nIF YOU DO NOT KNOW YOUR OWN NO-MIND, ON WHOM CAN YOU CALL FOR WITNESS AND PROOF?\nNobody can be a witness to you. Nobody can enter into your no-mind, and you cannot have any proof except the transformation of your character.\nOTHER THAN THE IDENTITY OF NO-MIND AND BUDDHA, WHAT PROOF DO YOU SEEK?\nDaikaku is throwing the question on the monk. The monk was asking, “How can we be certain that somebody is a buddha?”\nYou cannot be certain about somebody being a buddha, unless you are a buddha. Only a buddha can recognize another buddha. The buddha can recognize even the potential buddhas. When I call you bodhisattvas, that’s what I mean – you are potential buddhas. The next moment you may awake, this moment you may be snoring. It is your right to snore, to sleep, to dream, to get out of all of this vicious circle. But whether you are asleep or awake, your inner quality does not change; the source remains always pure.\nYakusai wrote:\nA DEAFENING PEAL,\nA THIEF ESCAPED MY BODY. WHAT HAVE I LEARNED?\nTHE LORD OF NOTHINGNESS HAS A DARK FACE.\nHe is saying, “I had been trying to get rid of my mind – finally the thief left.” When for the first time your mind stops functioning, you encounter enormous darkness. Up to now you have been accustomed to the light of the small mind; now the light is so great that it is blinding. And one feels, in the beginning, that he has fallen into utter darkness. But slowly slowly, he becomes accustomed and starts seeing that the darkness was too much light.\nYou may have seen it happening: coming in from outside on a sunny day – entering your home it looks dark, but after an hour it is no more that dark. Your eyes are flexible. When you go out, if there is too much sun, the lenses of your eyes shrink. They don’t allow that much light in. And when you come home with those shrunken lenses of your eyes, it seems dark. You need your lenses to be larger again. It takes a little time, but soon the whole house is full of light.\nThe same is true about the inner eye – the first encounter is of great darkness. But darkness turning into light is a great experience. Then you know that they are not two, but two faces of the same coin.\nA haiku by Sodo:\nIN MY TEN-FOOT BAMBOO HUT THIS SPRING,\nTHERE IS NOTHING:\nTHERE IS EVERYTHING.\nJust visualize poor Sodo, a master in his own right, in his ten-foot bamboo hut. The spring has come; there is nothing and there is everything.…\nThe ultimate experience of meditation is of both: on the one hand there is nothing; on the other hand there is the whole universe.\nYou lose your old identity; that’s why it feels there is nothing. But you gain a new identity with the oceanic existence – then you feel there is everything. But both are authentic experiences.\nQuestion 1 Maneesha has asked:\nOUR BELOVED MASTER,\nSITTING IN FRONT OF YOU AND FACING NOTHINGNESS FOR A FEW MINUTES EACH EVENING IS ONE THING, BUT QUITE ANOTHER WHEN IT CONFRONTS ONE DURING THE OTHER TWENTY-THREE HOURS AND FIFTY-FIVE MINUTES OF THE DAY. IT SEEMS EASIER EITHER NOT TO EVEN KNOW SUCH A SPACE EXISTS, OR TO GO INTO IT TOTALLY THROUGH SITTING IN MEDITATION ALL DAY.\nTHE THIRD WAY – OF GOING THROUGH THE MOTIONS OF DAILY LIFE, WHILE WALKING AROUND FEELING EMPTY INSIDE – IS REALLY WEIRD. YET YOU SEEM TO DO IT SO BEAUTIFULLY. CAN YOU GIVE US SOME TIPS?\nManeesha, it certainly looks weird if you are utterly silent, not angry, and trying to show anger. It looks weird because you feel the split, and your anger has not that heat. Inside you are nothing and outside you are showing love; your love is bound to be lukewarm, not even lukewarm. And you will be feeling a strange split; that creates the weirdness.\nBut look at it from this point: actors on the stage, do they feel weird? They know perfectly they are not what they are pretending to be. But knowing that it is only acting, there is no conflict. So this is the only tip I can give to you: your whole life should be just an acting – deep inside, eternal silence; on the outside, whatever is the requirement, act it. But that action does not create any split because you know it is acting.\nThe weirdness comes only when your action becomes identified with you, and at the same time you are pulling yourself into nothingness, and the action is pulling you towards the outer world. Then you are in a weird space. Otherwise silence, nothingness, can remain untouched.\nYou can do anything, whatever you feel. See with your clarity what is needed and do it totally. But remember, the outer world is the world of drama. Never forget for a moment that the outside is only drama. Then inside you can remain at peace, carrying on every kind of work without any weirdness.\nBefore we enter into our daily meditation, just a few tips so that nobody goes weird. Just become a buddha and come out! Go in from the same door and come back out from the same door.\nIt is a fateful day in the Kingdom of Kwatz! Three notorious criminals – Gunn, the German; Andre, the Frenchman; and Sagar, the Proper – are all being brought up to the guillotine for execution.\nGunn, the German, climbs the long stairs, and the black-hooded executioner asks him, “How do you want to go, face-up or face-down?”\nThe German stiffens up proudly and shouts, “I am the bravest of Germans, I vill vatch it coming – put me face-up!”\nHe is placed on the block face-up and the executioner pulls the lever. The blade comes hurtling down, and at the very last moment screeches to a halt, just millimeters from the German’s neck.\n“Hurray!” shouts the crowd. “It’s a miracle! It’s a miracle! Set him free! Set him free!” and Gunn, the German, is set free.\nThen Andre, the Frenchman, is brought up.\n“Which way do you want to go?” asks the black-hooded executioner, “face-up or face-down?” “I am a man of zee earth!” exclaims Andre. “I will go face-down!”\nThe Frenchman is placed face-down on the block. The huge guillotine blade is slowly raised into position. There is a tense hush over the crowd. Then the lever is pulled and the blade plunges with tremendous force towards the waiting Frenchman’s neck – but at the last moment it screeches to a grinding halt.\n“Another miracle! Another miracle!” screams the crowd. “Free him, too! Let him go!” And the Frenchman is set free.\nThen Sagar, the Proper, carefully mounts the stage stairs. Adjusting his crystal necklace, combing his hair and removing some dust off his shirt, he stands ready before the executioner.\n“So what will it be for you?” asks the executioner, removing his hood to reveal himself as the Master of Masters, Shree Rajneesh. “Face-up or face-down?”\n“Are you kidding?” says Proper Sagar, bowing to touch The Master’s feet. “I’m not going near that thing until you get it fixed!”\nBalonski is totally drunk and he staggers into a fairground. He goes up to the rifle range and says, “Give me ten shots!”\n“That will be two dollars,” laughs the attendant.\nBalonski fumbles around, pays the money, grabs the gun, and fires ten quick shots, each of them a perfect bull’s-eye.\nThe attendant is shocked and amazed as he hands Balonski the grand prize, a twelve-inch, live turtle.\nSome time later the drunk returns, dropping his bottle of vodka on the counter. He plops down two dollars, grabs the gun and fires another ten shots – again, all of them perfect bull’s-eyes.\nFlustered, the attendant sweeps his arm across the prizes and says, “Choose anything you want.”\nBalonski looks around blinking and then says, “Just give me another one of those crunchy sandwiches!”\nOn their tenth wedding anniversary, Herman and Hettie Horowitz decide to make a trip around Europe. They fly from L.A. to Paris and rent a car.\nA week later they are driving through the Austrian Alps when they see a small signpost which reads: “Wishing Well – first turn left.”\nHerman is a little skeptical but he follows the signpost and stops the car next to an old, stone well. The couple get out of the car and go over to the well.\nHerman leans over the well, and following the instructions he throws in a coin, then silently makes his wish.\nThen Hettie does the same, but she leans too far, loses her balance and falls head-first into the well. “Wow!” shouts Herman, stepping back. “It really works!”\nNivedano... (Drumbeat) (Gibberish) Nivedano... (Drumbeat)\nBe silent, close your eyes... feel your body to be frozen.\nCollect all your life energy inwards,\nmove towards the center.\nThis is the door we have been talking about. Don’t get stuck with the door, look beyond.\nEven a few steps beyond the door will be an immense experience.\nGoing beyond the door,\nyou are moving in the oceanic reality. You are no more.\nThe door was your boundary – you have gone beyond it. These are the most blissful moments of your life.…\nThis is your buddhahood.\nTo make it more clear, Nivedano... (Drumbeat)\nRelax, leave the body aside, the mind aside... and you stand just aloof...\na watcher, just a witness.\nThis is the heart of the buddha.\nThis is his great contribution to humanity – that just by watching, witnessing,\nyou can enter into the eternal. Drink as much as you can from your original source.\nIt will refresh you, it will resurrect you, it will give you a new character.\nAnd without any effort\nyou will find yourself changing every day. Your whole life will become a dance, a song. Nivedano...\n(Drumbeat)\nCome back, but bring with you the fragrance, the silence, the beautitude that you are experiencing.\nSit down for a few moments just reminding yourself that you are the buddha,\nthat eternity is yours,\nthat you are beyond life and death,\nthat you are part of this immense universe which is always here.\nOkay, Maneesha?\nYes, Beloved Master.\nCan we celebrate the gathering of the ten thousand buddhas? Yes, Beloved Master!\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"6594","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/turning_in/part5/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/turning_in/>Turning In</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">5 Meditation, the method of great liberation</h1><div class=post-meta>31 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;6594 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Turning_In/part5.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part4>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

METHOD OF GREAT LIBERATION; ALL THE TEACHINGS FLOW FORTH FROM THIS;
MYRIAD PRACTICES ARE MASTERED THIS WAY. SUPERNORMAL POWERS, KNOWLEDGE,
WISDOM AND VIRTUE, ALL ARISE FROM HERE. THE PATH OF LIFE OF HUMANS AND
GODS OPENS HEREIN; ALL THE BUDDHAS HAVE ENTERED AND LEFT BY THIS DOOR.
BODHISATTVAS PRACTICING IT HAVE ENTERED THIS DOOR. DISCIPLES AND
SELF-ENLIGHTENED ONES ARE STILL ONLY HALFWAY THERE, WHILE OUTSIDERS,
THOUGH THEY PRACTICE, DO NOT ENTER THE RIGHT PATH. WHATEVER ESOTERIC OR
EXOTERIC SCHOOLS DO NOT PRACTICE THIS, DO NOT HAVE ANYONE WHO REALIZES
THE WAY OF BUDDHAHOOD.”</p><p><br></p><p>A MONK THEN ASKED DAIKAKU, “WHAT DOES IT MEAN THAT SITTING MEDITATION
IS THE ROOT SOURCE OF ALL THE TEACHINGS?” DAIKAKU ANSWERED, “MEDITATION
IS THE INNER NO-MIND OF THE ENLIGHTENED ONES; DISCIPLINE IS THEIR OUTER
CHARACTER; DOCTRINE IS THEIR SPEECH; BUDDHA-REMEMBRANCE IS THE
INVOCATION OF THE BUDDHA’S NAME. ALL COME FROM THE ENLIGHTENED NO-MIND
OF THE BUDDHAS; THEREFORE, IT IS CONSIDERED FUNDAMENTAL.”</p><p><br></p><p>THE MONK ASKED AGAIN, “THE METHOD OF MEDITATION IS FORMLESS AND
THOUGHTLESS; SPIRITUAL QUALITIES ARE NOT OBVIOUS, AND THERE IS NO PROOF
OF SEEING REALITY – SO HOW CAN WE BELIEVE IN THIS?”</p><p>DAIKAKU SAID, “YOUR OWN NO-MIND AND THE ENLIGHTENED NO-MIND ARE ONE –
IS THAT NOT SPIRITUAL QUALITY? IF YOU DON’T KNOW YOUR OWN NO-MIND, ON
WHOM CAN YOU CALL FOR WITNESS AND PROOF? OTHER THAN THE IDENTITY OF
NO-MIND AND BUDDHA, WHAT PROOF DO YOU SEEK?”</p><p><br></p><p>Maneesha, Daikaku is making some very important statements for those
who are on the path; not for those who are seeking knowledge,
respectability, reputation. Daikaku is a master only if you are a
seeker. Unless your whole life depends on a single point of finding your
own center, the very source of your being, you will not be able to
understand what Daikaku is saying.</p><p><br></p><p>But this assembly is no ordinary crowd. This assembly is of the
bodhisattvas, who are essentially buddhas, and their urge to explore
their inner reality to its totality has brought them from all corners of
the world. This is the right assembly for a man like Daikaku.</p><p><br></p><p>DAIKAKU SAID TO HIS ASSEMBLY OF MONKS:</p><p><br></p><p>SITTING MEDITATION IS THE METHOD OF GREAT LIBERATION.</p><p><br></p><p>It is very strange that just by silently sitting, watching your
thoughts moving here and there as if they do not belong to you – you
don’t have to do anything about them, not even make a judgment – just
sitting silently not doing anything, and the door opens. Your ultimate
reality is not something to be sought in the outside world; it is hidden
in the seeker himself. The moment you start looking for it here and
there, you are going far away, far away from yourself. There is no need
to go anywhere. Just sit down, settle down. The mind is just like dust
in water. If you are patient enough, the dust will settle and the
crystal-clear water will be there reflecting the full moon.</p><p><br></p><p>Zen does not preach any discipline, any doctrine, any practice. It is
one of the greatest blessings to humanity that Zen has made the search
for oneself so obvious and so simple.</p><p><br></p><p>SITTING MEDITATION IS THE METHOD OF GREAT LIBERATION; ALL THE
TEACHINGS FLOW FORTH FROM THIS; MYRIAD PRACTICES ARE MASTERED THIS WAY.
SUPERNORMAL POWERS, KNOWLEDGE, WISDOM AND VIRTUE, ALL ARISE FROM HERE.
THE PATH OF LIFE OF HUMANS AND GODS OPENS HEREIN; ALL THE BUDDHAS HAVE
ENTERED AND LEFT BY THIS DOOR.</p><p><br></p><p>These sentences have to be remembered. While sitting silently you
will come across a door within you, just an opening. If you remain in
this opening, still, many things will start happening to you: knowledge,
wisdom, some miraculous powers, great virtue – but this is only the
door.</p><p><br></p><p>A few are sitting outside the door; they can sit as long as they
want. They are exoteric people who cannot look in, who always look out.
They have become obsessed with the outside reality. They are also
sitting by the side of the door. But their back is towards the door, not
their face.</p><p><br></p><p>The disciple is also sitting, but his face is towards the door. But
this is only a door to a tremendous phenomenon of existence. You are not
to stop here, although it will allure you with great wisdom, miraculous
powers, virtues. It will bring you peace and silence.</p><p><br></p><p>But Daikaku says, ALL THE BUDDHAS HAVE ENTERED AND LEFT BY THIS
DOOR.</p><p>There is something more beyond this door. The buddhas have entered
and left the door behind. They have gone beyond.</p><p><br></p><p>What is beyond knowledge? – innocence. What is beyond wisdom? – just
a sense that “I know nothing.” What is beyond miracles? – no buddha has
done a miracle.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha did not walk on water and did not turn water into wine and did
not make any Lazarus come back to life. Compared to Jesus he has not
done anything, but he is far beyond Jesus. Jesus is only at the door; he
has not entered into the ultimate reality. Buddha cannot do any miracle
for the simple reason that he is no more. He cannot be knowledgeable
because he has dropped himself, like a dewdrop from the lotus leaf into
the ocean. His let-go is so total that a tremendous energy field is
created around him in which anything may happen; but he is not the
doer.</p><p><br></p><p>I would like to show you the difference. Lazarus died – he was a
friend of Jesus, and a follower. His sisters were followers of Jesus.
They wouldn’t allow the town’s people to bury the dead man. Jesus was
informed; he was far away. It took four days, and when he came, the dead
body of Lazarus was being kept in a cave in the mountains. He called,
“Lazarus! Come out!” and Lazarus came out. This is thought to be the
greatest miracle of Jesus.</p><p><br></p><p>A similar situation arose before Buddha, but the story is totally
different. A woman was going to drown herself, but people saved her
somehow. Her husband had died but she had a small child, so she thought
to live for the child. But then the child died; now there was nothing
for her to live for. People said, “Don’t be worried, Buddha is in the
town. You come with us, bring the dead body of the child. And if he
cannot make him alive, then nobody can do anything.”</p><p><br></p><p>The woman came crying, weeping, carrying the body of the dead child.
Buddha said, “Leave the child here. I will bring him back to life on one
condition: you have to bring some mustard seeds from a house where
nobody has ever died.”</p><p><br></p><p>The poor woman could not understand the logic of it. She thought,
“What a great opportunity! This is not difficult” – because mustard seed
was the principal crop in that village. “There must be some house where
nobody has died.” She went from house to house.</p><p><br></p><p>And they said, “How many mustard seeds do you want? We can bring many
carts full if your child can be revived. But it won’t help, because not
only one person but thousands of people must have died in this house, in
this family. And you are unnecessarily wasting your time – you cannot
find a house where nobody has died.”</p><p><br></p><p>But she went on searching – perhaps... a hope against hope. By the
evening it became clear that everybody who is born dies, and she could
not find the required mustard seeds. But her tears disappeared, and
instead of tears a great awareness arose, that “Life and death exist
together. And what does it matter if my child dies today or tomorrow? He
would have to die, and it is good that he has died before me. If I had
died first he would have been an orphan, a beggar. This is a great
blessing.”</p><p><br></p><p>By the time she reached Buddha the sun was setting, and Buddha said,
“Where are the mustard seeds?”</p><p>She fell down at Buddha’s feet and she said, “I have brought myself,
not the mustard seeds. I want to be initiated into the search for that
which never dies.”</p><p><br></p><p>Now you can see the difference between the two stories. In one
Lazarus is resurrected, but he will have to die again. What was the
point of resurrecting him? He has not been transformed. He has not
gained any insight, he has not become awakened. But this woman in a
similar situation with a great master, encounters the very basic
problem: how to transcend life and death? How to get beyond this circle
of life and death?</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha initiated her, and he said, “For this reason I had to send you
– so that the understanding arose on your own that everybody dies. Now
the question is, is there something that never dies? And I am happy that
you have come back with that understanding. Your initiation is not an
imitation, your initiation is out of understanding.”</p><p><br></p><p>Christian missionaries continuously go on saying that except for
Jesus, nobody – neither Buddha nor Bodhidharma... there have been
thousands of masters, but Jesus is unique because of his miracles. But
buddhas will laugh.</p><p><br></p><p>The real miracle is that the woman has come to an understanding that
she wants to enter into herself. From the outside you may not think it a
great miracle. To resurrect the body is not the question – he will die
again, you are simply giving him another chance to die.</p><p><br></p><p>Even Christian scholars are finding all the miracles of Jesus
unfounded. They have been added three hundred years after Jesus, to give
him a glamor that he is really the son of God. All pure fiction!</p><p><br></p><p>Now there is a great controversy going on in Christian circles: can
we accept Jesus if his miracles are proved fictitious? Take away the
miracles and Jesus is nothing. But take anything away from Gautam
Buddha, he is still a Gautam Buddha. You cannot take away anything from
him because nothing is added. He has remained simply himself, no
fiction, no mythology. This is a real miracle, that a man who influenced
the whole East also managed that nobody add any mythology, any fiction
to his life. His life has remained a pure flame without any smoke.</p><p><br></p><p>ALL THE BUDDHAS HAVE ENTERED AND LEFT... This is only a door. It is
not a place to live, it is simply a passage to pass through.<span class=s4></span>AND LEFT BY THIS DOOR.</p><p><br></p><p>BODHISATTVAS PRACTICING IT HAVE ENTERED THIS DOOR. DISCIPLES AND
SELF- ENLIGHTENED ONES ARE STILL ONLY HALFWAY THERE WHILE OUTSIDERS,
THOUGH THEY PRACTICE, DO NOT ENTER THE RIGHT PATH.</p><p><br></p><p>If you are doing some practice outside, that means you are doing some
yoga exercise, distorting the body this way and that way, standing on
your head. And nobody ever thinks, “Is self-realization a certain
posture of the body?” You can go on standing on your head for your whole
life but still you will not become enlightened; you will just become a
very fat head. All the blood will accumulate in your head, your hands
and legs will slowly start shrinking. Certainly you will not be a human
being anymore, but just a big football with small hands and legs. It is
a miracle, but what can you do with such a miracle?</p><p>This statement, DISCIPLES AND SELF-ENLIGHTENED ONES ARE STILL ONLY
HALFWAY</p><p>THERE... They have not even reached the door.</p><p><br></p><p>It will be a little difficult to distinguish between the enlightened
one and the self-enlightened. The self-enlightened is only imagining
that he is enlightened. Nobody can prevent you from imagining any kind
of thing you want. And nobody can refute you, because there is no way to
refute and there is no way to argue for or against.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard about a madman who got the idea that he was dead.
Madness was not enough, he added something more. He would say, “I know
that I am dead.”</p><p><br></p><p>People said, “Don’t say such things; you are talking, you are
walking, you are eating.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “So what? That does not prove that I am not dead. I have
seen many dead people doing the same thing. What do you think about
yourself?” Then people thought that this was very dangerous: if their
families heard that this fellow thought that everybody is dead, and
talking and eating and walking do not matter; you are dead and it can
continue<span class=s4></span>They took him to a psychiatrist who
said,</p><p>“Don’t be worried. I will cure him.”</p><p><br></p><p>They said, “We are not worried about him, we are worried about you –
because he has cured many people. A few of his friends have started
having another thought, that perhaps they are dead. He is very
convincing, a very logical and rational person.”</p><p><br></p><p>The psychiatrist said, “You go and leave him with me.”</p><p><br></p><p>To the madman the psychiatrist said, “Have you heard that dead men
don’t bleed?” He said, “Yes, when I was alive I had heard it, I
remember.”</p><p>Then the psychiatrist said, “The matter is settled.”</p><p><br></p><p>He took out his knife and cut a little on the mad fellow’s hand and
blood came out. The madman said, “Aha! That means that proverb is wrong:
dead men do bleed. Now give me the knife, I will try it on you.”</p><p><br></p><p>The psychiatrist said, “You will try it on me?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I have to know whether you are alive or dead. Now it is
proved that dead people bleed. If you are dead, you will bleed. If you
are still alive you will not bleed. Just give me your hand.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “My God, your family was right.”</p><p><br></p><p>The madman took his hand and made a good cut and said, “Look! We both
are dead. Everybody is dead. I have not come across a single person who
is alive. But everybody is deluded – what can you do?”</p><p><br></p><p>The psychiatrist said, “Please don’t tell anybody else that I am
dead. You just go home.”</p><p>He said, “Which home? I am coming with you. Behave like a dead man –
graceful, silent, friendly. I can help your practice very much: every
day I can have a table in your office. Difficult patients that you
cannot treat, I can treat within a minute. It just has to be proved that
they are dead. And a dead person cannot worry, a dead person cannot
dream; they are just befooling themselves. A dead person needs no
psychiatry.”</p><p><br></p><p>Daikaku is saying, BODHISATTVAS PRACTICING IT HAVE ENTERED THIS
DOOR.</p><p><br></p><p>They have not stopped at the door, they have passed through it. There
is every allurement to remain at the door because you suddenly feel
immensely powerful, capable of doing miracles.</p><p><br></p><p>But a real seeker is not in search of miracles, he is in search of
the source of his life from where everything arises.</p><p><br></p><p>BODHISATTVAS PRACTICING IT HAVE ENTERED THE DOOR, left the door
behind, become buddhas. Their miracle is their love, their miracle is
their compassion. Their miracle is to spread buddhahood like a
wildfire.</p><p><br></p><p>Making wine out of water is not a miracle, it is a crime. Don’t do
any such thing here. If Jesus had made wine into water, that was
perfectly natural, there was no crime in it. But making wine out of
water is certainly dangerous. But whether dangerous or not, it is
trivia, not a miracle.</p><p><br></p><p>The only miracle is to be authentic, honest, yourself. And then
anything that follows around you, in your field, is not your doing. So
those who are of great understanding that their ultimate aim is to
search for the buddha within, they have entered the door.</p><p><br></p><p>DISCIPLES AND SELF-ENLIGHTENED – this is a category of mad people –
ARE STILL ONLY HALFWAY THERE,</p><p><br></p><p>WHILE OUTSIDERS, THOUGH THEY PRACTICE, DO NOT ENTER THE RIGHT
PATH.</p><p><br></p><p>Those who are outside can go on doing austerities, self-torture,
fasts and all kinds of things, but they will not enter. And those who
have only half entered will remain clinging to the door. And the door is
not the reality; you have to pass through it, beyond.…</p><p><br></p><p>In other words, the door is the mind and the beyond is the no-mind –
and that is the only miracle worth calling a miracle.</p><p><br></p><p>WHATEVER ESOTERIC OR EXOTERIC SCHOOLS DO NOT PRACTICE THIS, DO NOT
HAVE ANYONE WHO REALIZES THE WAY OF BUDDHAHOOD.</p><p><br></p><p>All esoteric schools are just hallucinatory, playing on the
imagination of man with all good intentions, but they are not the path
to know the truth, to know the source of life. And the exoteric who are
doing outward things<span class=s4></span>For example, they drop their
clothes, and they think because they have become</p><p>naked they have attained great virtue.</p><p><br></p><p>One cannot imagine the blindness of man. All the animals are naked –
except for a few English dogs. Some old ladies in England still cover
their dogs. When they take the dog for a walk they</p><p>go on pulling their leashes, particularly to keep him from making any
tree or lamppost a toilet. Or he may come across a girlfriend... to
prevent him from enjoying a love affair, they go on pulling the leash.
And the dogs have to be covered, because naked dogs remind them of
pornography. These women are really pornographic! England has a few
specialties; one of these specialties is these old women. Even today
they are afraid to leave their dogs, or even their chair legs or table
legs naked, because that is pornographic. Now, who is pornographic? –
these women, in their imagination.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard about three old men, great friends, all retired. One was
sixty-five, another was seventy- five, and the third was eighty-five.
One evening when they were meeting in the park, a daily routine, they
found the youngest, the sixty-five-year-old, looking very sad. They
asked, “What is the problem? You can tell us. We have been friends for
years.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I am so ashamed. But I have to tell you that I was looking
through the keyhole of the bathroom when a beautiful woman, who was a
guest in my house, was taking her bath.”</p><p><br></p><p>The other two laughed and said, “You idiot, everybody has done that.
It is nothing special.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man said, “You have not heard the whole story. I was caught
red-handed and my mother slapped me.”</p><p><br></p><p>Those two old fellows again said, “Don’t be worried – every child
does it. And it is very rare to find a mother who does not slap.”</p><p><br></p><p>That sixty-five-year-old man said, “You don’t understand – it is not
a question of childhood, it happened today!”</p><p><br></p><p>They said, “Then it is certainly serious, but not much to be worried
about.”</p><p><br></p><p>The seventy-five-year-old then said, “My problem is more difficult.
Whenever I make any approach to my wife, she simply turns over and says,
‘I am suffering from a great headache. Don’t bother me!’ Years have
passed. I have already forgotten how to make love.”</p><p><br></p><p>The third man laughed. He said, “You are also of the same category.
Think about my problem. This morning my wife started beating me.”</p><p><br></p><p>They said, “This is serious. What happened?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I was just preparing to make love, and she started beating
me and told me, ‘You idiot! The whole night, three times, you have
already made love. Neither do you sleep nor do you allow me to
sleep.’”</p><p><br></p><p>The other two fellows laughed and said, “It seems he is losing his
memory. Otherwise at this age, four times... unbelievable!” They said,
“You consult some psychologist. You are simply losing your memory.”</p><p><br></p><p>The only grown-up-ness is not of age: you may be eighty-five and
still an old goat. Goats don’t grow wiser, they simply grow older. The
only path to wisdom goes inwards.</p><p>That’s why no other animal except man can know himself, because no
other animal has any idea at all of the inner. Everything is outer. You
become a man when you become aware that there is something inner. And it
has to be searched for vigorously, because life is not certain – at any
moment death may destroy the opportunity.</p><p><br></p><p>A MONK THEN ASKED DAIKAKU, “WHAT DOES IT MEAN THAT SITTING MEDITATION
IS THE ROOT SOURCE OF ALL THE TEACHINGS?”</p><p><br></p><p>It looks very simple; that’s why it creates questions. Just say to
somebody, “Sit silently and everything will happen,” and he will think
you are mad: “You have to do something for something to happen.”</p><p><br></p><p>One great American writer, Napoleon Hill, has written a book, THINK
AND GROW RICH – just think. I thought, he seems to be a Zen master,
because they say, “Sit and find the buddha.” This fellow is saying,
“Think and grow rich.” Just think, with closed eyes, that a Lincoln
Continental is standing in your porch: if you think really hard, you
will find it.</p><p><br></p><p>He seems to be a very articulate writer, very convincing, that this
whole world is your idea. Whatever you think happens. Think of money and
money will start coming; think of a beautiful woman and you will hear a
knock on the door, but the basic requirement is first to believe. If you
don’t believe, nothing is going to happen. That condition is tricky. If
the Lincoln Continental does not arise in your porch, you know your
belief is not strong enough to pull that big a car. If instead of a very
beautiful woman a very ugly woman knocks on the door you know that
Napoleon Hill is right, but your belief staggered, wavered; and this
ugly lady is the result.</p><p><br></p><p>It happened that the day Napoleon Hill’s book was published – in
America the writers promote their books – he was standing in the
bookstore where the book was released and he was signing books for the
first buyers. By chance, Henry Ford came to look for some books and he
saw this fellow autographing. He asked the owner of the shop, “Who is
this fellow, and what is he doing here?”</p><p><br></p><p>He told him, “He is a great writer and his book is selling like hot
cakes. It is a great book. Just seeing the name, you will be surprised.
Think of purchasing it. It is called, THINK AND GROW RICH.”</p><p><br></p><p>Henry Ford was a very clever, cunning fellow. He went to Napoleon
Hill, looking at him from up to down, from down to up, and asked, “Have
you come in your own car or on a public bus?”</p><p><br></p><p>Napoleon Hill said, “What kind of question is that? I am answering
questions about my book.” Henry Ford said, “It is about your book.”</p><p>He said, “I have come on the public bus.”</p><p><br></p><p>Henry Ford said, “That shows that your book is a fraud. You don’t
even have your own car. Can’t you think? I am Henry Ford and this is my
address. So when you have your own car, come to me and I will purchase
your book. But get the car by thinking, not by any other means.”</p><p><br></p><p>Poor Napoleon Hill was so shocked, and could not say anything in
answer.</p><p>There have been many movements like this in the world, particularly
in Christian countries. There is a movement called Christian Science
which believes that whatever you believe happens – just believe it
totally. They have their churches in all the great cities where they
meet and read their literature, and enforce each other’s belief, nourish
each other with their own experiences, encourage each other to believe
and it will happen. People return from their meetings full of joy, “Now
I am going to really believe and really think for something great to
happen.”</p><p><br></p><p>The movement died, by and by; it had to die because it was so
stupid.</p><p><br></p><p>One young man was encountered by an old woman who asked, “Your father
is a regular member of our church, science and Christianity combined,
but I have not seen him for two or three weeks. Where is he?”</p><p><br></p><p>The young man said, “He is sick, very sick.”</p><p><br></p><p>The old woman said, “All nonsense! He simply believes that he is
sick. Just tell him to think, ‘I am healthy. Who says I am sick?’ Go
home immediately!”</p><p><br></p><p>The boy was not a Christian Scientist; he giggled at this old woman.
His father was really sick, but he said, “I will tell him your
message.”</p><p><br></p><p>After a few weeks again they met and again the old woman said, “What
happened? Did you tell your father?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I told him, but now he thinks he is dead. It has been
almost one week – everything is finished. We all tried, and he tried to
think that everything is going great...”</p><p><br></p><p>By thinking you cannot reach anywhere. That’s why in Zen the question
arises again and again.</p><p><br></p><p>A MONK ASKED DAIKAKU, “WHAT DOES IT MEAN THAT SITTING MEDITATION IS
THE ROOT SOURCE OF ALL THE TEACHINGS?”</p><p><br></p><p>DAIKAKU ANSWERED, “MEDITATION IS THE INNER NO-MIND.”</p><p><br></p><p>By sitting he does not mean that you sit and think about a Lincoln
Continental. Sitting in Zen means simply sitting and doing nothing, not
even thinking, not even chanting a mantra; creating a silent space where
even you are not, just a pure mirror reflecting nothing.</p><p><br></p><p>MEDITATION IS THE INNER NO-MIND OF THE ENLIGHTENED ONES; DISCIPLINE
IS THEIR OUTER CHARACTER.</p><p><br></p><p>What you see as discipline is really their manifestation of
meditation in the outside world. A buddha walks in a certain way, talks
in a certain way, looks in a certain way. All his gestures have a
quality of buddhahood, of awareness.</p><p><br></p><p>But you cannot reverse the sequence: you cannot first discipline
yourself and hope that by disciplining yourself you will become a
buddha. First you have to become a buddha; discipline</p><p>comes on its own accord. And that discipline which comes
spontaneously is the only right discipline. Otherwise, everything is
torture.</p><p><br></p><p>DISCIPLINE IS THEIR OUTER CHARACTER; DOCTRINE IS THEIR SPEECH.</p><p><br></p><p>Whatever they say comes from the very source of life. The source is
not the great scriptures, the source is their own experience. Hence,
whatever they say is their doctrine.</p><p><br></p><p>BUDDHA-REMEMBRANCE IS THE INVOCATION OF THE BUDDHA’S NAME.</p><p><br></p><p>There have been many Zen masters who would wake up in the morning and
the first thing they would ask.<span class=s4></span>For example,
Obaku used to ask every morning, “Obaku, are you still here?”</p><p><br></p><p>And his disciples would say, “If outsiders listen to it they will
think you are mad. Why do you do it?”</p><p><br></p><p>And he would say, “Because in the night I forget completely... a
silent mind with no dreams, no thoughts. When I wake up I have to remind
myself again that Obaku is still here. Who can I ask? I can ask only
myself, ‘Obaku are you still here?’”</p><p><br></p><p>And he himself would say, “Yes, sir.”</p><p><br></p><p>One has to have a deep respect towards oneself. It would be a good
discipline for you. Rather than repeating the names of Rama and Krishna,
it would be a great discipline for you just to ask yourself your own
name: “Devageet, are you still here?” Don’t bother that Raj may be
listening. And say, “Yes, sir.”</p><p><br></p><p>And all of you, if you can do this much, you will be surprised what a
great silence follows when you say, “Devageet, are you still here?” and
you yourself say, “Yes, sir.” Then there follows a great silence. And it
is also a remembrance of your own being, also a respectfulness, a
gratitude that one day more is given to you, that again the sun will
rise, that again for one day at least, you will be able to see the roses
blossom.</p><p><br></p><p>A man of no-mind, a man of meditation, finds himself so grateful for
each moment that life gives to him. There is no reason – you don’t
deserve it, nobody deserves it. It is a sheer gift of life. You cannot
ask to extend your life even by a single moment. You cannot say, “I am
worthy, so let me have a few more years; I deserve it.”</p><p><br></p><p>Nobody deserves. But life goes on pouring in you out of its
abundance.</p><p><br></p><p>ALL COME FROM THE ENLIGHTENED NO-MIND OF THE BUDDHAS; THEREFORE, IT
IS CONSIDERED FUNDAMENTAL.</p><p><br></p><p>THE MONK ASKED AGAIN, “THE METHOD OF MEDITATION IS FORMLESS AND
THOUGHTLESS; SPIRITUAL QUALITIES ARE NOT OBVIOUS, AND THERE IS NO PROOF
OF SEEING REALITY – SO HOW CAN WE BELIEVE IN THIS?”</p><p><br></p><p>DAIKAKU SAID, “YOUR OWN NO-MIND AND THE ENLIGHTENED NO-MIND ARE ONE –
IS THAT NOT SPIRITUAL QUALITY?”</p><p>What Daikaku is saying is that your mind, minus your thoughts, is the
no-mind of the buddha. And do you think it is not a spiritual quality?
Because out of this no-mind will arise truthfulness, integration,
compassion, all kinds of virtues and love.</p><p><br></p><p>IF YOU DO NOT KNOW YOUR OWN NO-MIND, ON WHOM CAN YOU CALL FOR WITNESS
AND PROOF?</p><p><br></p><p>Nobody can be a witness to you. Nobody can enter into your no-mind,
and you cannot have any proof except the transformation of your
character.</p><p><br></p><p>OTHER THAN THE IDENTITY OF NO-MIND AND BUDDHA, WHAT PROOF DO YOU
SEEK?</p><p><br></p><p>Daikaku is throwing the question on the monk. The monk was asking,
“How can we be certain that somebody is a buddha?”</p><p><br></p><p>You cannot be certain about somebody being a buddha, unless you are a
buddha. Only a buddha can recognize another buddha. The buddha can
recognize even the potential buddhas. When I call you bodhisattvas,
that’s what I mean – you are potential buddhas. The next moment you may
awake, this moment you may be snoring. It is your right to snore, to
sleep, to dream, to get out of all of this vicious circle. But whether
you are asleep or awake, your inner quality does not change; the source
remains always pure.</p><p><br></p><p>Yakusai wrote:</p><p><br></p><p>A DEAFENING PEAL,</p><p><br></p><p>A THIEF ESCAPED MY BODY. WHAT HAVE I LEARNED?</p><p>THE LORD OF NOTHINGNESS HAS A DARK FACE.</p><p>He is saying, “I had been trying to get rid of my mind – finally the
thief left.” When for the first time your mind stops functioning, you
encounter enormous darkness. Up to now you have been accustomed to the
light of the small mind; now the light is so great that it is blinding.
And one feels, in the beginning, that he has fallen into utter darkness.
But slowly slowly, he becomes accustomed and starts seeing that the
darkness was too much light.</p><p><br></p><p>You may have seen it happening: coming in from outside on a sunny day
– entering your home it looks dark, but after an hour it is no more that
dark. Your eyes are flexible. When you go out, if there is too much sun,
the lenses of your eyes shrink. They don’t allow that much light in. And
when you come home with those shrunken lenses of your eyes, it seems
dark. You need your lenses to be larger again. It takes a little time,
but soon the whole house is full of light.</p><p><br></p><p>The same is true about the inner eye – the first encounter is of
great darkness. But darkness turning into light is a great experience.
Then you know that they are not two, but two faces of the same coin.</p><p>A haiku by Sodo:</p><p><br></p><p>IN MY TEN-FOOT BAMBOO HUT THIS SPRING,</p><p>THERE IS NOTHING:</p><p><br></p><p>THERE IS EVERYTHING.</p><p><br></p><p>Just visualize poor Sodo, a master in his own right, in his ten-foot
bamboo hut. The spring has come; there is nothing and there is
everything.…</p><p><br></p><p>The ultimate experience of meditation is of both: on the one hand
there is nothing; on the other hand there is the whole universe.</p><p><br></p><p>You lose your old identity; that’s why it feels there is nothing. But
you gain a new identity with the oceanic existence – then you feel there
is everything. But both are authentic experiences.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 1 Maneesha has asked:</p><p>OUR BELOVED MASTER,</p><p><br></p><p>SITTING IN FRONT OF YOU AND FACING NOTHINGNESS FOR A FEW MINUTES EACH
EVENING IS ONE THING, BUT QUITE ANOTHER WHEN IT CONFRONTS ONE DURING THE
OTHER TWENTY-THREE HOURS AND FIFTY-FIVE MINUTES OF THE DAY. IT SEEMS
EASIER EITHER NOT TO EVEN KNOW SUCH A SPACE EXISTS, OR TO GO INTO IT
TOTALLY THROUGH SITTING IN MEDITATION ALL DAY.</p><p><br></p><p>THE THIRD WAY – OF GOING THROUGH THE MOTIONS OF DAILY LIFE, WHILE
WALKING AROUND FEELING EMPTY INSIDE – IS REALLY WEIRD. YET YOU SEEM TO
DO IT SO BEAUTIFULLY. CAN YOU GIVE US SOME TIPS?</p><p><br></p><p>Maneesha, it certainly looks weird if you are utterly silent, not
angry, and trying to show anger. It looks weird because you feel the
split, and your anger has not that heat. Inside you are nothing and
outside you are showing love; your love is bound to be lukewarm, not
even lukewarm. And you will be feeling a strange split; that creates the
weirdness.</p><p><br></p><p>But look at it from this point: actors on the stage, do they feel
weird? They know perfectly they are not what they are pretending to be.
But knowing that it is only acting, there is no conflict. So this is the
only tip I can give to you: your whole life should be just an acting –
deep inside, eternal silence; on the outside, whatever is the
requirement, act it. But that action does not create any split because
you know it is acting.</p><p><br></p><p>The weirdness comes only when your action becomes identified with
you, and at the same time you are pulling yourself into nothingness, and
the action is pulling you towards the outer world. Then you are in a
weird space. Otherwise silence, nothingness, can remain untouched.</p><p>You can do anything, whatever you feel. See with your clarity what is
needed and do it totally. But remember, the outer world is the world of
drama. Never forget for a moment that the outside is only drama. Then
inside you can remain at peace, carrying on every kind of work without
any weirdness.</p><p><br></p><p>Before we enter into our daily meditation, just a few tips so that
nobody goes weird. Just become a buddha and come out! Go in from the
same door and come back out from the same door.</p><p><br></p><p>It is a fateful day in the Kingdom of Kwatz! Three notorious
criminals – Gunn, the German; Andre, the Frenchman; and Sagar, the
Proper – are all being brought up to the guillotine for execution.</p><p><br></p><p>Gunn, the German, climbs the long stairs, and the black-hooded
executioner asks him, “How do you want to go, face-up or face-down?”</p><p><br></p><p>The German stiffens up proudly and shouts, “I am the bravest of
Germans, I vill vatch it coming – put me face-up!”</p><p><br></p><p>He is placed on the block face-up and the executioner pulls the
lever. The blade comes hurtling down, and at the very last moment
screeches to a halt, just millimeters from the German’s neck.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hurray!” shouts the crowd. “It’s a miracle! It’s a miracle! Set him
free! Set him free!” and Gunn, the German, is set free.</p><p><br></p><p>Then Andre, the Frenchman, is brought up.</p><p><br></p><p>“Which way do you want to go?” asks the black-hooded executioner,
“face-up or face-down?” “I am a man of zee earth!” exclaims Andre. “I
will go face-down!”</p><p>The Frenchman is placed face-down on the block. The huge guillotine
blade is slowly raised into position. There is a tense hush over the
crowd. Then the lever is pulled and the blade plunges with tremendous
force towards the waiting Frenchman’s neck – but at the last moment it
screeches to a grinding halt.</p><p><br></p><p>“Another miracle! Another miracle!” screams the crowd. “Free him,
too! Let him go!” And the Frenchman is set free.</p><p><br></p><p>Then Sagar, the Proper, carefully mounts the stage stairs. Adjusting
his crystal necklace, combing his hair and removing some dust off his
shirt, he stands ready before the executioner.</p><p><br></p><p>“So what will it be for you?” asks the executioner, removing his hood
to reveal himself as the Master of Masters, Shree Rajneesh. “Face-up or
face-down?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you kidding?” says Proper Sagar, bowing to touch The Master’s
feet. “I’m not going near that thing until you get it fixed!”</p><p><br></p><p>Balonski is totally drunk and he staggers into a fairground. He goes
up to the rifle range and says, “Give me ten shots!”</p><p>“That will be two dollars,” laughs the attendant.</p><p><br></p><p>Balonski fumbles around, pays the money, grabs the gun, and fires ten
quick shots, each of them a perfect bull’s-eye.</p><p><br></p><p>The attendant is shocked and amazed as he hands Balonski the grand
prize, a twelve-inch, live turtle.</p><p><br></p><p>Some time later the drunk returns, dropping his bottle of vodka on
the counter. He plops down two dollars, grabs the gun and fires another
ten shots – again, all of them perfect bull’s-eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>Flustered, the attendant sweeps his arm across the prizes and says,
“Choose anything you want.”</p><p><br></p><p>Balonski looks around blinking and then says, “Just give me another
one of those crunchy sandwiches!”</p><p><br></p><p>On their tenth wedding anniversary, Herman and Hettie Horowitz decide
to make a trip around Europe. They fly from L.A. to Paris and rent a
car.</p><p><br></p><p>A week later they are driving through the Austrian Alps when they see
a small signpost which reads: “Wishing Well – first turn left.”</p><p><br></p><p>Herman is a little skeptical but he follows the signpost and stops
the car next to an old, stone well. The couple get out of the car and go
over to the well.</p><p><br></p><p>Herman leans over the well, and following the instructions he throws
in a coin, then silently makes his wish.</p><p><br></p><p>Then Hettie does the same, but she leans too far, loses her balance
and falls head-first into the well. “Wow!” shouts Herman, stepping back.
“It really works!”</p><p>Nivedano... (Drumbeat) (Gibberish) Nivedano... (Drumbeat)</p><p>Be silent, close your eyes... feel your body to be frozen.</p><p>Collect all your life energy inwards,</p><p>move towards the center.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the door we have been talking about. Don’t get stuck with the
door, look beyond.</p><p>Even a few steps beyond the door will be an immense experience.</p><p>Going beyond the door,</p><p><br></p><p>you are moving in the oceanic reality. You are no more.</p><p>The door was your boundary – you have gone beyond it. These are the
most blissful moments of your life.…</p><p>This is your buddhahood.</p><p><br></p><p>To make it more clear, Nivedano... (Drumbeat)</p><p>Relax, leave the body aside, the mind aside... and you stand just

original source.</p><p>It will refresh you, it will resurrect you, it will give you a new

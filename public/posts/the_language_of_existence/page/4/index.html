MASTER,</p><p>DAIO ONCE SAID TO A MONK: THE PEAK EXPERIENCE, THE FINAL ACT --
AS</p><p>SOON AS YOU TRY TO PURSUE IT IN THOUGHT, THERE ARE WHITE CLOUDS</p><p>FOR A THOUSAND MILES. BUT EVEN IF YOU GO BACK UPON SEEING THE</p><p>MONASTERY FLAGPOLE AT A DISTANCE, OR HEAD OFF FREELY UPON SEEING</p><p>A BECKONING HAND, THIS IS STILL ONLY HALF THE ISSUE; IT IS NOT YET
THE</p><p>STRATEGIC ACTION OF THE WHOLE CAPABILITY.</p><p>YOU HAVE TRAVELED AND STUDIED VARIOUS PLACES AND SPENT A LONG</p><p>TIME IN MONASTERIES. DON'T STICK TO THE RUTS IN THE ROAD OF THE</p><p>ANCIENTS -- YOU MUST TRAVEL A LIVING ROAD ON YOUR OWN.</p><p>EAST, WEST, FOOT UP, FOOT DOWN, USING IT DIRECTLY -- ONLY THEN
WILL</p><p>YOU KNOW THAT THE PEAK EXPERIENCE ILLUMINES THE HEAVENS AND</p><p>COVERS THE EARTH, ILLUMINES THE PAST AND FLASHES THROUGH THE</p><p>PRESENT. THIS IS YOUR OWN PLACE TO SETTLE AND LIVE. WHEN I SAY THIS,
I AM ONLY USING WATER TO OFFER FLOWERS, NEVER ADDING ANYTHING</p><p>EXTRA.</p><p>ON ANOTHER OCCASION DAIO SAID TO A ZEN NUN, "AT THE TOP OF THE</p><p>HUNDRED-FOOT POLE, GO FORWARD."</p><p>THE NUN REPLIED, "AT THE TOP OF THE HUNDRED-FOOT POLE,</p><p>THERE IS NO PLACE TO GO."</p><p>DAIO SAID, "WHERE THERE IS NO PLACE TO STEP, GO A HUNDRED</p><p>THOUSAND STEPS FARTHER -- ONLY THEN WILL YOU BE ABLE TO WALK</p><p>ALONE IN THE RED SKIES, PERVADING THE UNIVERSE AS YOUR WHOLE</p><p>BODY."</p><p>THE NUN AGREED AND DAIO CONTINUED: "THAT'S ALL. NOW YOU WANT</p><p>TO RETURN TO YOUR OLD CAPITAL AND HAVE COME WITH INCENSE IN YOUR</p><p>SLEEVE TO ASK FOR A SAYING. I ONCE MADE A VERSE OF PRAISE ON THE</p><p>MASTER OF IKUSAN, SO I WILL WRITE THAT:</p><p>"'ATOP THE POLE, WALK ON BY THE ORDINARY ROUTE. IT IS MOST</p><p>PAINFUL, WHEN TAKING A TUMBLE IN A VALLEY. EARTH, MOUNTAINS, AND</p><p>RIVERS CANNOT HOLD YOU UP, AND SPACE SUPPRESSES LAUGHTER, FILLING</p><p>A DONKEY'S CHEEKS.'</p><p>"I ASK YOU, ZEN NUN," CONTINUED DAIO, "TO BRING THIS UP AND LOOK
AT</p><p>IT TIME AND AGAIN: HOW TO GO FORWARD FROM ATOP THE POLE? SUDDENLY,
WHEN THE TIME COMES, YOU CAN GO FORWARD A</p><p>STEP, AND</p><p>SPACE WILL SURELY SWALLOW A LAUGH. REMEMBER, REMEMBER."</p><p>Osho - The Language of Existence 2</p><p>Chapter 1 - Remember, remember!</p><p>Maneesha, before I discuss these very significant statements, I have
to inaugurate Avirbhava's Museum of Gods. She has brought a few great
gods, but before she brings her gods before you I have to say something
about them.</p><p>"Octopus: On the island of Corfu in the Greek archipelago, the
octopus was worshipped as an incarnation of one of the Greek gods.</p><p>Known as the most evil of the sea animals, the innocent octopus
acquired the name</p><p>'devil-fish' by fearful ancient fishermen."</p><p>The second is, "Crocodile: Among the southern Bantus of Africa, the
crocodile is considered sacrosanct.</p><p>The Egyptian god Sebek was believed to take the shape of a crocodile;
sometimes he was represented as wholly animal, sometimes only with a
crocodile head. Offerings of cake, meat, and honey wine were made to the
sacred crocodiles, some of which were tamed by priests.</p><p>Oracles were drawn from the crocodiles' behavior, and they were
embalmed at death."</p><p>And the third is, "Lobster: The lobster was generally considered
sacred among the ancient Greeks.</p><p>In New Caledonia, the crab goddess, or demon, is known to have a
sacred grove. On the trees in her grove are hung little packets of food
for her. She is the enemy of married people, and is known to cause
elephantiasis.</p><p>Even today, the lobster is worshipped in the Isa district fishing
villages of Japan. Huge replicas are paraded through the towns during
their festivals."</p><p>Before I ask Avirbhava to bring her newly acquired gods, I have heard
a joke about an octopus:</p><p>Klopski is overjoyed with his new pet octopus, Clyde. The magnificent
creature drinks vodka like a fish, but also can play any musical
instrument in the world.</p><p>One evening, after polishing off a few bottles of vodka together,
Clyde and Klopski go out to the Jumpin' Jellyfish Jazz Club.</p><p>Klopski shouts, "Hey, everybody! I will bet anyone here that my
octopus can play anything anyone gives him."</p><p>Laughter fills the bar. Then Benny the banjo player says, "Okay, I
bet you fifty dollars he can't play my banjo."</p><p>Klopski nods enthusiastically, swallows back a shot of vodka and
gives one to Clyde. The octopus swallows his drink and crawls onto the
stage, grabbing not one but two banjos on the way.</p><p>As he plays "God Save The Queen," he sneaks out a free tentacle and
snatches another glass of vodka.</p><p>"Hey, man," yells Pete the piano player, "that is cool. But I will
bet you a hundred bucks he can't play my grand piano."</p><p>Osho - The Language of Existence 3</p><p>Chapter 1 - Remember, remember!</p><p>"Right!" yells Klopski, swallowing his vodka, and pouring one for the
octopus. Clyde knocks back the vodka and jumps on the piano. Waving all
his arms about wildly, Clyde plays the Polish national anthem
stylishly.</p><p>"That is fine," comes a shout from the corner, "but I will bet you
five hundred dollars he will never be able to play this!" It is Hamish
MacTavish, and be brings</p><p>a big, old Scottish bagpipe up to Klopski.</p><p>"Okay," says Klopski. But before Klopski can touch it, Clyde leaps on
the bagpipe, squeezing and tangling his arms all over it. Then the
octopus and the bagpipe fall onto the floor in a knotted heap, making
only a pitiful gasping sound.</p><p>Losing the bet, an enraged Klopski grabs the octopus, holds him up in
the air and cries,</p><p>"What the hell went wrong with you?"</p><p>"Well," grins the octopus, drunkenly, "she looked so beautiful, but I
just couldn't get her cotton panties off!"</p><p>Now, Avirbhava, come on.</p><p>(A GREY VELVETY OCTOPUS APPEARS IN FRONT OF THE PODIUM, HOLDING</p><p>BETWEEN HIS TENTACLES A FLUTE, PLAYING THE BEATLES TUNE "IN AN</p><p>OCTOPUS' GARDEN", AND DANCING UP AND DOWN IN FRONT OF</p><p>THE MASTER.) So let him settle on the Stonehead, now ...</p><p>(BUT THE OCTOPUS LANDS ON NIRVANO'S HEAD INSTEAD. MEANWHILE, A LARGE
CROCODILE IS INCHING ALONG THE PODIUM, WHILE A RED, CUDDLY</p><p>LOBSTER IS DANCING IN THE AIR. FINALLY, THE OCTOPUS GETS TO HIS</p><p>DESTINATION -- STONEHEAD'S HEAD. THE MASTER IS CHUCKLING AND</p><p>ENJOYING THE SHOW TREMENDOUSLY, AS WELL AS THE ASSEMBLY, WHICH IS</p><p>SIMPLY DROWNING IN AN OCEAN OF LAUGHTER.)</p><p>Great, Avirbhava! Take your gods away. DAIO ONCE SAID TO A MONK:</p><p>THE PEAK EXPERIENCE, THE FINAL ACT -- AS SOON AS YOU TRY TO
PURSUE</p><p>IT IN THOUGHT, THERE ARE WHITE CLOUDS FOR A THOUSAND MILES. BUT</p><p>EVEN IF YOU GO BACK UPON SEEING THE MONASTERY FLAGPOLE AT A DISTANCE,
OR HEAD OFF FREELY UPON SEEING A BECKONING HAND, THIS IS</p><p>STILL ONLY HALF THE ISSUE; IT IS NOT YET THE STRATEGIC ACTION OF
THE</p><p>WHOLE CAPABILITY.</p><p>YOU HAVE TRAVELED AND STUDIED VARIOUS PLACES AND SPENT A LONG</p><p>TIME IN MONASTERIES. DON'T STICK TO THE RUTS IN THE ROAD OF THE</p><p>ANCIENTS -- YOU MUST TRAVEL A LIVING ROAD ON YOUR OWN.</p><p>Osho - The Language of Existence 4</p><p>Chapter 1 - Remember, remember!</p><p>THIS CAN BE CALLED ONE OF THE VERY FUNDAMENTALS OF ZEN: DON'T</p><p>STICK TO THE RUTS IN THE ROADS OF THE ANCIENTS -- YOU MUST TRAVEL A
LIVING ROAD ON YOUR OWN.</p><p>The fact is, you cannot travel on anybody's road because that road
will never lead you to yourself. It will lead you to somebody else,
whose road it is. Never</p><p>be a follower; always be a path finder. And the path in the unknown
reality of your inner world is made by walking into the unknown, without
any road prepared by others for you.</p><p>All the religions are doing that: they are preparing roads for
millions of people --</p><p>highways, super highways. There are six hundred million Catholics
walking on one road.</p><p>They are not going to reach anywhere; not a single one of them has
reached even to the state of Jesus Christ. And nobody even thinks about
it. Six hundred million Catholics for eighteen hundred years following a
certain road persistently, and they have not produced a single Jesus
worth the name. It is not their fault, it is our whole mental makeup. We
have been told that we have to walk on paths which are prepared. But
this is a different path.</p><p>All paths that go outwards are prepared beforehand. You can go to the
north, you can go to the south; you can go anywhere, the road is ready.
But to go inside, no road is ready, you will have to create it by
walking. It will remain always an individual pathway. Nobody else will
ever walk on it and nobody else should ever walk on it, because that
will lead him into a hypocrisy. He will become someone else that he is
not. It is a very important message: DON'T STICK TO THE RUTS IN THE ROAD
OF THE ANCIENTS.</p><p>All the religions emphasize the opposite; all the religions try to
prove that they are the most ancient -- to be an ancient religion is a
great value. The reality is, the more ancient a religion is, the more
rotten it is bound to be. The more ancient, the farther away from
you.</p><p>There is no question of following any ancient way. You should not
follow even a modern way, because all ways that are created by others
may only be suitable for them.</p><p>This is a great challenge of existence, that you have to create your
own path to your own temple. No help is possible, and it is the grandeur
of humanity, a tremendous dignity, that you can follow only your own
path.</p><p>All religions are leading people wrongly; they are destroying people,
making them into sheep. An authentic religion will make a man into a
lion who walks alone, who never walks in a crowd. The crowd never suits
him, because with the</p><p>crowd you have always to compromise.</p><p>With the crowd you have always to listen to others: their criticism,
their appraisal, their conceptions of right and wrong, their values of
good and bad.</p><p>In the crowd you cannot remain natural. The crowd is a very unnatural
environment.</p><p>Unless you are very aware, the crowd is going to crush you into dust.
It is because of this that you don't find many buddhas in the world. A
buddha has to fight inch by inch for his individuality. He has not to
give way to the crowd, whatever the cost. Unless such an uncompromising
attitude remains constantly in you, you cannot remain unaffected by the
crowd in which you live.</p><p>And unfortunately everybody is born in a crowd -- the parents, the
teachers, the neighbors.</p><p>Nobody is fortunate enough to be born alone, so that is out of the
question. You are born in the society, in the crowd. Unless you can keep
your intelligence clean of the pollution that will Osho - The Language
of Existence</p><p>5</p><p>Chapter 1 - Remember, remember!</p><p>be surrounding you from every side, sooner or later you will become
somebody else, somebody who nature had never intended you to be.</p><p>Remember constantly that you have your own destiny, just as everybody
else has his own destiny. Unless you become the flower, the seeds of
which you have been carrying within you, you will not feel blissfulness,
fulfillment, contentment, you will not be able to dance in the wind, in
the rain, in the sun. You can be in paradise only as an individual, if
you have followed the path that you create by walking in. There are no
ready-made pathways.</p><p>When you enter in, you enter into pure space -- not a road; there are
not even footprints.</p><p>Buddha used to say that the inner world is just like the sky. The
birds fly but they don't leave their footprints. Nobody can follow their
footprints because in the</p><p>sky their footprints are not; as they have flown away, their
footprints have dissolved.</p><p>The inner sky remains always pure, just waiting for you, because
nobody can get inside you. He is saying:</p><p>YOU MUST TRAVEL A LIVING ROAD ON YOUR OWN. EAST, WEST, FOOT UP, FOOT
DOWN, USING IT DIRECTLY -- ONLY THEN WILL YOU KNOW THAT THE</p><p>PEAK EXPERIENCE ILLUMINES THE HEAVENS AND COVERS THE EARTH, ILLUMINES
THE PAST AND FLASHES THROUGH THE PRESENT. THIS IS YOUR</p><p>OWN PLACE TO SETTLE AND LIVE.</p><p>Following your own path, not imitating anybody, you are bound to
reach the space where you will feel you have arrived at the home, where
you can settle for eternity.</p><p>WHEN I SAY THIS I AM ONLY USING WATER TO OFFER FLOWERS, NEVER</p><p>ADDING ANYTHING EXTRA.</p><p>He is perfectly aware that people may start following him. Such is
the stupidity of humanity. To the man who is saying, "Never follow
anybody," they say, "Okay." But their okay means, "Now we are going to
follow you." When the person is saying, "Never follow anybody," he is
included in that "anybody." Then why is he speaking, what is he doing?
He says:</p><p>I AM ONLY USING WATER TO OFFER FLOWERS, NEVER ADDING ANYTHING</p><p>EXTRA.</p><p>I am saying the very essential, not adding anything extra, just like
watering flowers.</p><p>Such a simple thing ... following yourself is such a simple thing.
The flowers</p><p>will start blossoming, you just go on watering them, nourishing them
with your attention, with your love, with your silence, with your
celebration, with your laughter. Just don't add anything extra from
other sources, from scriptures, from great teachers, from buddhas.
Nobody is to be included on your path. Your path has to be absolutely
pure and virgin.</p><p>ON ANOTHER OCCASION DAIO SAID TO A ZEN NUN, "AT THE TOP OF THE</p><p>HUNDRED-FOOT POLE, GO FORWARD."</p><p>It will look a very absurd statement.</p><p>AT THE TOP OF THE HUNDRED-FOOT POLE, GO FORWARD.</p><p>You will think that man is mad. There is no way to go anywhere, you
will cling to the pole. But going inside is just like this, as if you
are standing on a hundred- foot-long pole. And Osho - The Language of
Existence</p><p>6</p><p>Chapter 1 - Remember, remember!</p><p>when you go in there is no road, just pure inner sky. It is a jump
into the unknown, but a jump of tremendous beauty.</p><p>You may have heard, or you may not have heard ... On the China Wall
that surrounds the whole of China -- it is the biggest wall in the world
... It took one thousand years to build; it is almost a mountain. And it
is so wide that you can drive a car on it, and as high as sixty feet,
seventy feet, eighty feet -- as the terrain allows. It was built against
the Mongol attackers, to prevent them from entering China. And of course
they were absolutely unable -- a hundred-foot wall standing between
Mongolia and China.</p><p>China had suffered so much from the Mongols that it took on this
tremendous task --</p><p>almost inhuman. It took one thousand years to make the wall, and
millions of people were engaged in the work. But it had to be done
because great Mongols like Genghis Khan ... he alone killed forty
million people. Killing was their joy.</p><p>His son killed thirty million people; another Mongol, Tamerlane,
again killed forty million people. The successor of Tamerlane, Nadir
Shah, is thought to have killed more than any of his forefathers, but
there are no records available. The whole of China must have become so
threatened by these monsters --</p><p>murderers for no reason, just for the simple joy they would burn a
whole city alive -- that they made this China Wall.</p><p>A fictitious story is connected with the China Wall. There is a place
in the China Wall where it is said that if you stand there and look at
the other side, you simply give a good laughter and jump, you never
return. Many people tried but they simply laughed and jumped.</p><p>And it is one hundred feet high, a mountainous terrain. The fiction
became so much of a reality that the government had to put soldiers
there to prevent people from looking from that place. Nobody could
explain it. What happens? Why do they simply laugh? What do they
see?</p><p>And then without saying anything to anybody, they simply jump.</p><p>I don't think it is a historical fact but I understand it as
mythological, and a very beautiful phenomenon. When you look in, you are
looking into a tremendous nothingness. And all that the mystics have
done is, they have given a laugh and jumped. They have simply said
goodbye and jumped.</p><p>It is so enchanting, so magnetically pulling; the gravitation is so
much that once you look in, you cannot resist taking the jump. It is
risky, it is dangerous, you may be lost. But on the contrary, you find
yourself for the first time. You were lost before; hence the laughter.
And now you have come home, which was just looking inwards, and
everything that you ever wanted is fulfilled. You have entered the lotus
paradise.</p><p>This statement -- AT THE TOP OF THE HUNDRED-FOOT POLE, GO</p><p>FORWARD -- is not concerned with an actual pole. It is concerned with
your hundred-foot-long ego. That is your pole, where you are
standing.</p><p>Look within and take a jump! Then go forward.</p><p>THE NUN REPLIED, "AT THE TOP OF THE HUNDRED-FOOT POLE, THERE IS
NO</p><p>PLACE TO GO."</p><p>DAIO SAID, "WHERE THERE IS NO PLACE TO STEP, GO A HUNDRED</p><p>THOUSAND STEPS FARTHER -- ONLY THEN WILL YOU BE ABLE TO WALK</p><p>ALONE IN THE RED SKIES, PERVADING THE UNIVERSE AS YOUR WHOLE</p><p>BODY."</p><p>Osho - The Language of Existence 7</p><p>Chapter 1 - Remember, remember!</p><p>Zen has a language of its own. It is simple, but because we are
complicated we cannot understand the simple language. A
hundred-foot-long pole ... you would never have thought that it could be
representative of the ego.</p><p>Once you see the metaphor, it becomes very clear that everybody is
standing on a very long pole. And people are trying to get on longer
poles. When Henry Ford was dying, before his death he was asked, "What
have you learned in your whole life? Because you became the world's
greatest rich man -- from poverty to riches."</p><p>Henry Ford said, "Don't remind me. I have learned only one thing:
climbing poles. And when you have climbed the pole, you look so awkward,
so stupid. Fortunately you are alone there sitting on your pole. I have
learned the art of climbing poles, that has been my whole life. I have
not learned anything. I am dying without having learned anything from
life."</p><p>But Daio's interpretation:</p><p>WHERE THERE IS NO PLACE TO STEP ...</p><p>'Place' is always outside. Inside there is no place, there is only
space. And you should understand the difference between place and
space.</p><p>You are sitting here. The place you are sitting in is one thing and
the space that you are within is another. It is nothing material, so
there is no question of falling. There is no fear of falling into a
ditch. There is no place of any kind, just pure silence and
spaciousness. Where there is no place to step, that is the real place
from where to begin the journey.</p><p>Howsoever absurd, he has said a great truth.</p><p>GO A HUNDRED THOUSAND STEPS FURTHER -- ONLY THEN WILL YOU BE ABLE TO
WALK ALONE IN THE RED SKIES, PERVADING THE UNIVERSE AS YOUR WHOLE
BODY.</p><p>THE NUN AGREED AND DAIO CONTINUED: "THAT'S ALL. NOW YOU WANT</p><p>TO RETURN TO YOUR OLD CAPITAL AND HAVE COME WITH INCENSE IN YOUR</p><p>SLEEVE TO ASK FOR A SAYING. I ONCE MADE A VERSE OF PRAISE ON THE</p><p>MASTER OF IKUSAN, SO I WILL WRITE THAT:</p><p>'ATOP THE POLE, WALK ON BY THE ORDINARY ROUTE. IT IS MOST PAINFUL,
WHEN TAKING A TUMBLE IN A VALLEY. EARTH, MOUNTAINS, AND RIVERS</p><p>CANNOT HOLD YOU UP, AND SPACE SUPPRESSES LAUGHTER, FILLING A DONKEY'S
CHEEKS.'"</p><p>Once you have taken the jump into the inner space, everything is
easy. Before taking the jump everything is difficult. You have never
thought that you have any interiority, you have never thought that there
is any space inside.</p><p>When I say "your interiority" I don't mean your bones and your heart
and your brain. These are all outside coverings of your inside
nothingness. When you detach yourself from your body and mind and heart,
you find that place from where the journey begins. That is the true
pilgrimage, the only pilgrimage that is of any worth. All others are
unnecessarily running here and there, not knowing where they are
going.</p><p>Osho - The Language of Existence 8</p><p>Chapter 1 - Remember, remember!</p><p>I have heard ... Once George Bernard Shaw was caught in a railway
train without a ticket.</p><p>He had purchased a ticket, but where had he put it? He had much
luggage. He must have been like Avirbhava -- she travels with twelve
suitcases! So he looked into this suitcase, into that suitcase. The
whole compartment was filled with his clothes and things and books, and
the ticket collector finally said in desperation, "I know you, everybody
knows you. I cannot conceive that you are traveling without a ticket. It
must have got lost -- you have so much luggage. Don't be worried, I will
not come again, and I will give the message to the other ticket
collectors on the train not to bother you."</p><p>George Bernard Shaw shouted at him, "You idiot! You think I am taking
all this trouble for you? The problem is not the ticket, the problem is
that without the ticket I don't know where I am going. The train is
going so fast and I don't know which station I am to get out at.</p><p>And why are you standing here like an idiot? Just do your work and
let me find my ticket!" He was a world famous man, but he was a man with
a very bad memory.</p><p>A similar story is told about Mulla Nasruddin, but juicier. The
ticket collector comes, and Mulla Nasruddin looks into everything -- his
bags, his pockets. The ticket collector is standing there and he says,
"You have looked in every pocket, but you don't look in the left-side
pocket of your coat."</p><p>Mulla Nasruddin said, "Don't interfere in my work. Never mention that
pocket!"</p><p>He said, "You are strange. I am simply helping you because you cannot
find the ticket.</p><p>Perhaps ... why are you leaving out that pocket?"</p><p>Mulla Nasruddin said, "That is my only hope. If the ticket is not in
the left pocket, I am finished. So first I will look into everything
else. Only as the last resort may I touch that pocket. That is my last
hope, don't destroy it."</p><p>"I ASK YOU, ZEN NUN," CONTINUED DAIO, "TO BRING THIS UP AND LOOK
AT</p><p>IT TIME AND AGAIN: HOW TO GO FORWARD FROM ATOP THE POLE?"</p><p>I give you this poem. Remember, that this is my message: that you
have to leave the place and enter into space.</p><p>"SUDDENLY, WHEN THE TIME COMES, YOU CAN GO FORWARD A STEP, AND</p><p>SPACE WILL SURELY SWALLOW A LAUGH. REMEMBER, REMEMBER."</p><p>Don't be afraid of laughing. Just take a step from place into space,
have a good laugh and just go on. We are doing that every day -- not one
laugh but many laughs.</p><p>(A LOUD LAUGH IS HEARD FROM SARDAR GURUDAYAL SINGH.)</p><p>Sardar Gurudayal Singh, wherever this caravan is going you will be
needed. Without you life will not be so juicy.</p><p>Osho - The Language of Existence 9</p><p>Chapter 1 - Remember, remember! A haiku by Sodo:</p><p>AFTER THE MOON-VIEWING, MY SHADOW WALKING HOME</p><p>ALONG WITH ME.</p><p>AFTER THE MOON-VIEWING ... A full moon -- that has become traditional
in Zen. On the full-moon night the Zen seekers don't sleep, they walk
into the mountains where the moon has made waterfalls look as if silver
is falling, where the moon has made the whole surroundings a dream.</p><p>Sodo says, AFTER THE MOON-VIEWING ... This is called moon-viewing; it
is a tremendously aesthetic experience.</p><p>MY SHADOW WALKING HOME ALONG WITH ME.</p><p>Such silence. Nobody is with me, just my shadow walking along with
me. After seeing this whole beautiful world, when you enter into your
home nobody will be with you, not even your shadow. Your aloneness will
be total.</p><p>Every meditation is a preparation for enjoying the aloneness which is
our nature. Issa wrote:</p><p>NOT YET HAVING BECOME A BUDDHA, THIS ANCIENT PINE TREE,</p><p>IDLY DREAMING.</p><p>According to those who have awakened, everything is full of
buddhahood. Buddhahood is just the nature of existence. Issa's haiku is
saying: NOT YET HAVING BECOME A BUDDHA,</p><p>THIS ANCIENT PINE TREE,</p><p>Although it is ancient, it has not yet become a buddha. IDLY
DREAMING.</p><p>It is still dreaming. Someday it may wake up. This can be said about
everybody. We are all unconscious of our ultimate reality, and we go on
dreaming, we go on sleeping, we go on desiring, we go on longing for
this and that, not knowing that</p><p>the greatest treasure is within our awakening.</p><p>There is no more than becoming a buddha. You have come to the highest
peak of consciousness.</p><p>Consciousness is the only wealth. Osho - The Language of Existence

their way through the streets towards Crucifix Hill.</p><p>Suddenly, Jesus stumbles and he and his cross crash to the ground.
The procession grinds to a standstill. Slowly, Jesus gets back on his
feet, picks up the cross, and carries on.</p><p>"Pontius, did you see that?" remarks Mrs.Â Pilate, out of the corner
of her mouth, as she continues waving with a smile plastered on her
face.</p><p>"Yes, dear," replies Pontius, "I'm afraid he did it again."</p><p>"Well, I really don't care who he is," remarks Mrs.Â Pilate. "If he

HE</p><p>WILL INSTANTLY KNOW THE TASTE OF THE WATERS OF THE DISTANT OCEANS</p><p>AND THE NEARBY SEAS, OF THE SOUTHERN BEACHES AND THE NORTHERN</p><p>SHORES, IN FACT OF ALL THE SEA WATER IN THE WORLD.</p><p>Maneesha, Hakuin is one of the most respected Zen masters. His
respect is because of his ability to express the inexpressible, to
create devices that somehow can manage to give you a glimpse of the
unknown. He is basically concerned with the method. If a right method is
used in the right time and ripe time, it is not going to fail. If you
are on the right way, it may take some time to reach, but you will
reach. The whole question before Hakuin is: the right way, the right
method, the right beginning.</p><p>It was Gautam Buddha's habitual way of expression. All the great
qualities that he has called for in an experienced, self-realized man,
all begin with the word 'right'. For example, he will not say simply
samadhi. He will say samma samadhi. Samadhi can go wrong, people can
mistake similar experiences for samadhi and get lost.</p><p>That's what happened to Aldous Huxley when he took LSD. He was a man
of tremendous knowledge, particularly of the East, and most of the
saints of the East he knew well. He immediately said that, "The
experience of LSD is samadhi, the same experience that Patanjali has
described, the ultimate phenomenon."</p><p>Osho - The Language of Existence 15</p><p>Chapter 2 - Go like an arrow</p><p>This gives a clear illustration that Buddha was right not to use
simply the word samadhi. It is dangerous. You can find something else
and think it is samadhi; there are similar phenomena. There are people
who have become addicted to opium, or hashish, or marijuana.</p><p>And these drugs have been used for centuries, from the very beginning
of man. It is nothing new.</p><p>The reason why they became addicted is because the drugs gave them a
glimpse of something ... how things should be. They are temporary
glimpses, and they are produced by chemicals so they don't go beyond the
mind. But mind gets a glimpse, just as the lake reflects the faraway
moon. And the experience is so beautiful that not to repeat it again and
again becomes impossible.</p><p>All the societies have been fighting against drugs but the fight has
not been successful. It will never succeed the way the society is. It
can succeed only if you give people the right experience of samma
samadhi -- 'samma samadhi' means right samadhi -- so that they can make
a differentiation, a discrimination between what is right and what is
wrong. Those who have known their buddha- nature are not addicted to
drugs, do not need drugs for their experience. Their experience is not
caused by any chemicals; their experience is caused by turning their
whole energy in towards the center of their being. That has nothing to
do with chemicals. But chemicals can give you an illusion, something
very similar.</p><p>Hakuin has adopted Buddha's habit. Buddha never spoke about anything
without adding the word 'right' first, because his understanding was --
and he is correct -- that everything can go wrong if you get caught up
with something similar which is illusory. And you cannot make the
distinction because you don't know the real. Unless you know the real,
how can you expect to make a discrimination between the unreal and the
real?</p><p>It was a great contribution of Gautam Buddha that he would talk about
all the qualities using the word 'right' first. Samma means right.
Because everything can be taken for granted as right if you don't have
any experience of it. Then any illusion, any hallucination ... and these
hallucinations will drag you through life after life.</p><p>A man like Aldous Huxley, one of the most intelligent men of this
century, got</p><p>caught into it. He became addicted to LSD and he preached that what
he was experiencing was the same as what Buddha experienced and Kabir
experienced. This is definitely going beyond the limitations. Aldous
Huxley has no way to know what Kabir experienced, he has no way to know
what Buddha experienced. Buddha's experience was not dependent on any
LSD, it was an inner experience dependent only on his own
consciousness.</p><p>LSD gives you unconsciousness, not consciousness. If you are in a
good mood LSD can give you paradise; LSD is simply a magnifying glass.
If you are in a good mood, a loving mood, and you take LSD, you feel the
whole world is filled with love. You will even touch your chair with a
loving hand. All around everything will be beautiful, nothing will be
wrong.</p><p>But it lasts only for a few hours and when you wake up, you wake up
in a far worse world than the one you had been in before you took the
LSD, because you have seen something beautiful and now you see an
ordinary world which has lost its luster. You have seen in LSD</p><p>rainbows all around; suddenly they have all disappeared. You have
seen people having auras and now they are just so ordinary. But even to
imagine that they had an aura looks stupid.</p><p>But Buddha or Kabir, once they become enlightened ... this
enlightenment is not something that has to be renewed every year like a
license. Once it has happened, it has happened. It may become bigger and
more mature, but there is no way of going back. That is Osho - The
Language of Existence</p><p>16</p><p>Chapter 2 - Go like an arrow</p><p>the criterion of whether you are hallucinating through drugs or you
are authentically meditating.</p><p>The word 'right' has to be understood. Many people have been worried
about why Buddha continually uses the word right about every quality.
They are not aware that for every real quality there is a phony quality
available -- "made in U.S.A." That phony quality is cheap, but it serves
only for a few hours, and then you are caught in it because it is so
beautiful -- again and again ... And every time you take it, you have to
take it in a bigger dose because your body becomes</p><p>immune. A moment comes when no LSD can make any difference; your body
has become completely immune.</p><p>India is far more experienced with drugs because for ten thousand
years at least it has been trying to use all kinds of drugs and poisons
to create a cheap imitation of the ultimate experience. They have gone
even to the point ... even today there are monasteries in Ladakh where
they keep cobra snakes.</p><p>When a person becomes so accustomed to all the drugs that no drug
helps anymore, then the last thing is a cobra bite. The cobra bites on
his tongue, then he feels a little samadhi.</p><p>Otherwise a cobra bite usually means the end. And you will be
surprised: there are cases of the cobra dying, because the man is so
full of poison.</p><p>It has been used in India for centuries. Each great king used to
raise a beautiful girl, and from her very childhood she was given poison
-- from smaller doses to bigger doses. It made her so immune that she
was able to absorb any dose of poison without falling unconscious.</p><p>And the final stage was, when she became a young girl, blossomed in
her youth, she could be sent to the enemy king. There was no difficulty
in it, she had just to move to the other capital and the king himself
would become interested in her. Those girls were chosen from thousands
of beautiful girls; they were unique specimens. Immediately the king
would become aware that there was a beautiful girl he had never seen
before, and just a kiss from that girl was enough to kill the man.</p><p>It is good that nowadays you don't find such trained and disciplined
girls. They were available at the time of Gautam Buddha. And it was not
something that you use one time and then throw away, in the American
way. They would kill the king and they would come home ready to be sent
somewhere else, because nobody could think that the kiss of the girl had
killed the king.</p><p>Aldous Huxley and his colleagues are not aware of the whole history
of drugs. And why was the girl ready to take it? It gave such a good
feeling, such a joyful feeling. She was not thinking about what she was
being prepared for, but she was floating in a euphoria.</p><p>Buddha is right when he says samma samadhi. He will not accept
Aldous</p><p>Huxley's samadhi as a right samadhi. It is an illusion.</p><p>But I wonder that nobody has criticized Aldous Huxley. All the
governments are against drugs; obviously they should criticize Aldous
Huxley first. But they don't have either the intelligence or the
experience. That man at least had the experience of the illusory -- the
governments don't have the experience even of the illusory. But down the
ages, although every government has been against drugs, this has not
made any change. No prohibition ever makes any change; on the contrary
it increases your interest in the things prohibited.</p><p>I am against all prohibition. My own understanding is that if LSD can
give some glimpse of samadhi, then all its bad aftereffects should be
removed, because it is a chemical and it is in Osho - The Language of
Existence</p><p>17</p><p>Chapter 2 - Go like an arrow</p><p>our hands. Those bad aftereffects are the problem. They should be
removed and an LSD</p><p>number two should be made -- clean, taken in complete awareness that
it is going to give you only a glimpse. Its addictiveness can be taken
out, and when you know it is going to give you only a glimpse there is
no harm. It may lead you to the search for the real.</p><p>Rather than prohibiting the drugs, what is needed is to produce drugs
which lead people to samadhi, which give an indication: if a chemical
drug can be such a blessing, what will the real thing be? It is just a
dewdrop in comparison with the real oceanic feeling, the oceanic
ecstasy.</p><p>But nobody listens to any right approach. Thousands of people are
unnecessarily in the jails. The number may be millions, not thousands,
and most of them are underage; even six-year-olds have been found taking
drugs. Nobody has suggested any solution for it.</p><p>And once a boy or girl, whatever their age, takes the drug, they
cannot forget the experience. Everything else becomes just rotten; the
mind continuously hankers for the drug.</p><p>It is the duty of the governments of the whole world, through their
chemical drug research, to produce drugs which are not harmful, which
are not addictive. Any bad aftereffects have been removed, and only that
part which gives a joyous feeling, a desire to dance and a desire to
find something real is left, because that feeling will disappear within
hours.</p><p>These drugs can be used in a right way. Everything can be used in a
right way and everything can be used in a wrong way, but it is still the
same thing.</p><p>Hakuin said to his disciples:</p><p>THE STUDY OF ZEN IS LIKE DRILLING WOOD TO GET FIRE.</p><p>An old, ancient method.</p><p>THE WISEST COURSE IS TO FORGE STRAIGHT AHEAD WITHOUT STOPPING. IF</p><p>YOU REST AT THE FIRST SIGN OF HEAT AND THEN AGAIN AS SOON AS THE</p><p>FIRST WISP OF SMOKE ARISES, EVEN THOUGH YOU DRILL FOR THREE</p><p>ASAMKHYEYE KALPAS ...</p><p>Asamk means innumerable, and kalpas means yugas, or ages. If you
drill for asamk, for innumerable ages, you will never find a spark of
fire.</p><p>What he is saying is that there are things which have to be done
fast. If you do them slowly, at the most you may create smoke but not
fire. To create fire you have to drill hard and without resting. If,
seeing that the wood is becoming hot, you say, "Let us rest a little,"
the wood will become cool again. If, seeing that the wood is smoking,
you say, "Now the fire is not far away we can rest a little," the smoke
will disappear, the wood will become cool again.</p><p>The fire is hidden in the wood but you have to be very continuous
until you find the spark, the flame jumping up from the wood.</p><p>This is a very good example for meditators. You go a little while and
then you</p><p>say, "I have to go tomorrow again, what is the hurry? It is enough,
now rest -- and if finally everybody has to become a buddha, what does
it matter whether it is Sunday or Saturday? There are only seven days;
some day I will become a buddha." But if you think in terms of going
slowly, in a lousy way, taking rests, you will never reach.</p><p>Although the path is very short, it is short only for those who go
like an arrow. The arrow does not stop on the way, there are no stations
for the arrow. It does not rest a little while in Osho - The Language of
Existence</p><p>18</p><p>Chapter 2 - Go like an arrow</p><p>the air and then go again, it simply goes straight without halting on
the way. And that should be remembered by every meditator.</p><p>I have been using the word 'arrow' purposely so that you can
understand that going into yourself is not a morning walk -- that you
can return from anywhere. It is not something that you can do in parts;
you have to do it one day in a single quantum leap. Whenever you decide,
then don't look back, just go ahead.</p><p>Certainly it needs guts and courage because you are moving in a dark
and unknown space.</p><p>You don't have with you even a lamp -- no companion, you don't have
any map. And meditation demands that you go with the speed of light, so
fast that the journey of thousands of lives is completed in a single
moment.</p><p>Hakuin says:</p><p>MY NATIVE PLACE IS CLOSE TO THE SEASHORE, BARELY A FEW HUNDRED</p><p>PACES FROM THE BEACH. SUPPOSE A MAN OF MY VILLAGE IS CONCERNED</p><p>BECAUSE HE DOES NOT KNOW THE FLAVOR OF SEA, AND WANTS TO GO AND</p><p>TASTE IT FOR HIMSELF. IF HE TURNS BACK AFTER HAVING TAKEN ONLY A FEW
STEPS, OR EVEN IF HE RETURNS AFTER HAVING TAKEN A HUNDRED</p><p>STEPS, IN EITHER CASE WHEN WILL HE EVER KNOW THE OCEAN'S BITTER,
SALTY TASTE?</p><p>You have to go to the ocean; one hundred feet or two hundred feet,
that is not the question.</p><p>You have to go all the way.</p><p>BUT, THOUGH A MAN COMES FROM AS FAR AS THE MOUNTAINS OF KOSHU</p><p>OR SHINSHU, HIDA OR MINO, IF HE GOES STRAIGHT AHEAD WITHOUT</p><p>STOPPING, WITHIN A FEW DAYS HE WILL REACH THE SHORE, AND, THE</p><p>MOMENT HE DIPS THE TIP OF ONE FINGER INTO THE SEA AND LICKS IT,
HE</p><p>WILL INSTANTLY KNOW THE TASTE OF THE WATERS OF THE DISTANT OCEANS</p><p>AND THE NEARBY SEAS, AND OF THE SOUTHERN BEACHES AND THE</p><p>NORTHERN SHORES, IN FACT OF ALL THE SEA WATER IN THE WORLD.</p><p>But the question is of going to the sea, not just going in a lukewarm
way: "Today a few steps and then we will see tomorrow." But tomorrow you
will have to take these few steps again. And if this becomes your habit
-- "A few steps today and then we will see tomorrow" --</p><p>if this becomes your pattern then you will never reach. Always you
will be going on those few steps, and then the decision that, "It is
enough, now we will see</p><p>tomorrow."</p><p>For the meditator there is no tomorrow.</p><p>Future is not the concern of meditation. Future is the concern of the
mind; mind cannot live without future. If suddenly all future
disappears, mind will be at a loss what to do. Future is the space in
which mind goes on weaving imaginations, projects, ideas: what one is
going to become, what one is going to achieve. All ambitions are laid
out in the future. But if the future completely disappears -- suddenly
you come to the point where you see that there is no future -- either
your heart will stop or you will run away backwards, thinking that at
least the past will be there. But the past is not there.</p><p>The past and the future both are in your mind. Existentially there is
only this moment.</p><p>Osho - The Language of Existence 19</p><p>Chapter 2 - Go like an arrow</p><p>So when you meditate today, do it as if this is the last day. You may
not have any chance to meditate again, so go all the way to the
seashore. And once you have got the taste of your being -- the
rejoicing, the dancing, the blessing, the ecstasy -</p><p>- then there is no problem, you know the way. It is not far, it is
just within you, just a few inches away from your mind. But once you
have to know it. Just once you have to know it, then there is no
problem. Then you cannot forget it, then you cannot go away against it;
then it becomes your very life. And when meditation becomes one's very
life, there is nothing more in this existence to make you richer, to
make you more of a splendor. The secret is hidden within you.</p><p>A Zen poet wrote:</p><p>WITH A PIERCED NET -- a net with holes. WITH A PIERCED NET</p><p>I'VE CAUGHT</p><p>ALL THE BUTTERFLIES OF THE UNIVERSE.</p><p>He is not talking about butterflies; neither is he talking about a
pierced net. He is talking about your mind, which is certainly pierced
-- so many holes, so many loopholes, so many stitches here and there, so
many cracks. But the poet is saying, don't be worried: WITH A PIERCED
NET</p><p>I'VE CAUGHT</p><p>ALL THE BUTTERFLIES OF THE UNIVERSE.</p><p>Just know the secret. And the secret is to go beyond the pierced net.
Be a master of your mind, then even a pierced net is capable of catching
all the butterflies of the world. Right now your mind catches nothing.
From all the holes and loopholes everything goes on leaking out.</p><p>Have you seen that you are leaking continuously? I don't think ...
but now you will see.</p><p>Basho says, sitting silently ... It is right, but he does not know
that when you sit silently it is not necessarily true that the grass
grows by itself. What seems to be more likely is that the mind leaks by
itself. Basho's experience is a great experience, but this is a very
simple experiment that you can do. Just sitting in your room with closed
eyes, see: thoughts are rushing this way and that way, everything is
leaking.</p><p>When I say go beyond the mind, I mean go beyond all this leaking so
that you can find something solid to stand upon. Before you take the
jump, you need to find a spot at least to stand on, from which to jump
into the darkness, into the unknown territory of your own being.</p><p>Buddha is reported to have said that everything that is great is
bitter in the beginning and very sweet in the end -- and vice versa.
That which is very sweet in the beginning, for example a honeymoon, is
very bitter in the end. Meditation</p><p>may be entering into darkness, unknown territory, but it ends up in
self- illumination, in a great explosion of light. And once the
explosion has happened, you remain the buddha forever; you cannot go
back. The mind has Osho - The Language of Existence</p><p>20</p><p>Chapter 2 - Go like an arrow</p><p>gone, just as a shadow disappears. You function now from no-mind, and
any action from no-mind is good, is a blessing to the world.</p><p>Question 1 Maneesha has asked:</p><p>OUR BELOVED MASTER,</p><p>HAKUIN SAID, "THE WISEST COURSE IS TO FORGE STRAIGHT AHEAD</p><p>WITHOUT STOPPING." BUT IF WE KNEW WHERE STRAIGHT AHEAD WAS, WOULD WE
NEED TO WALK IT?</p><p>It is just a way of saying it. There is no problem in it when Hakuin
says, THE WISEST</p><p>COURSE IS TO FORGE STRAIGHT AHEAD. He is talking to the disciples,
not to the students; he is talking to the meditators.</p><p>When I say to you, go straight in, you don't ask me, "Where is this
'in'?" You don't consult an encyclopedia or a map of the world -- where
is this 'in'? You understand, you know perfectly well where it is, just
you have not gone that way before.</p><p>So, Maneesha, you know perfectly well where you have to go. Just go
straight ahead.</p><p>Walking will not do, not even running. That's why I have used the
word 'arrow' -</p><p>- with the speed of light. I have used the words 'quantum leap'. One
moment you</p><p>were not a buddha and another moment you are a buddha -- so fast.</p><p>There is no distance between you and your buddhahood, only a
misunderstanding. It is something like, two plus two is four but by some
mistake you have been calculating that two plus two is five, and I tell
you that this is a mistake: two plus two is not five, it is four. Do you
think you will have to do something? Immediately you see the point.</p><p>It is said that psychotics are ones who think two plus two is
certainly five. They are very fundamentalist. All fundamentalists are
psychotics. They know everything -- where God is ...</p><p>They know that the Holy Ghost committed a crime, and rather than
hanging God on the cross, the Jews hung the poor boy Jesus -- it was not
his fault.</p><p>The Holy Ghost and God are not separate. The Holy Ghost seems to be
God's personality, his mask. Not to say directly that God committed
adultery, and with a poor virgin, Mary, they say that the Holy Ghost did
it. And the poor boy who was born out of this criminal act, they
crucified. They should have crucified God, but the difficulty is ... In
fact everybody would like to crucify God, but where to find him? They
found the only begotten son, so they said, "It is near enough. Crucify
this fellow at least."</p><p>The psychotics cannot be convinced that two plus two is not five; the
neurotics are those who think that perhaps two plus two is four, but
they are very uncertain of it, very worried: why is it four? Why is it
not five? With five they were perfectly at ease. This is the way
psychologists find out who is a psychotic and who is a neurotic.</p><p>You cannot remove the psychotic from his position, whatever position
he has taken. The neurotic you can remove, but he will remain always
worried: "This seems to be right, but who knows? Perhaps I was right
before, because then I was at ease. Here, with two plus two making four
it creates such an anxiety."</p><p>Osho - The Language of Existence 21</p><p>Chapter 2 - Go like an arrow</p><p>There is no distance between you and your ultimate reality. Just an
about turn ... just, rather than looking outwards, close your eyes and
look in. In a single instance, when you have forgotten the outside world
completely -- the past, the future, everything -- and you remain only in
this moment, looking inwards, the happening, the transformation, the
arrival of the buddha ...</p><p>Question 2</p><p>Maneesha is also asking:</p><p>IS NOT OUR UNCERTAINTY, OUR GROPING, BECAUSE WE HAVE TO</p><p>DISCOVER FOR OURSELVES WHAT IS STRAIGHT AHEAD AND WHAT IS GOING</p><p>OFF TRACK?</p><p>If you look in you cannot go off track, because there are no tracks.
There are not two ways even. It is the outside world where if you don't
know, naturally you will have to grope around.</p><p>In the inside world you don't even have hands with which to grope.
The inside world is a pure seeing.</p><p>In this country we have called this seeing darshan. Darshan means
just seeing. And that does everything, you don't have to do anything
else.</p><p>Before you do the seeing, a little laughing. That's why you have not
done it before.</p><p>Pope the Polack is visiting the optician.</p><p>"I keep seeing spots in front of my eyes," complains the Polack
pope.</p><p>"Really?" replies the optician, putting a new pair of glasses on the
pope's nose. "There!</p><p>How's that?"</p><p>"Wow! That's great," replies Pope the Polack. "Now I can see the
spots much</p><p>clearer."</p><p>Luigi is sitting with his teenage son, Spagnoli.</p><p>"What-a do you want-a for your birthday, my son?" Luigi proudly asks
his son. "I wanna watch," says the son.</p><p>"Okay," shrugs Luigi. "It is-a okay with me if it is okay with-a your
mother." Get it? Otherwise in the middle of the night you will get
it!</p><p>(WAVES OF INCREASING LAUGHTER ARE ROLLING THROUGH BUDDHA HALL AS MORE
AND MORE DISCIPLES ARE GETTING IT.)</p><p>Do you see? Somebody got it! Osho - The Language of Existence 22</p><p>Chapter 2 - Go like an arrow</p><p>One morning, Miss Goodbody, the fifth grade teacher, asks the class
what the best kind of business is.</p><p>"Real estate," says little Ernie, "because everybody needs somewhere
to live, and houses always increase in value."</p><p>"Oil!" exclaims little Albert, "because cars always need petrol."</p><p>"No," says little Peggy Sue, from the back of the room. "The best
business in the world is prostitution."</p><p>"What!" cries Miss Goodbody, shocked. "Peggy Sue, how can you say
such a thing?"</p><p>"Easy," replies Peggy Sue, "because it is the only business where you
have it, you sell it, and you still have it."</p><p>Three women arrive at the Pearly Gates. Betty and Margaret are
English girls, and Lolita is Italian. Saint Peter looks the women over
very carefully. Then he</p><p>turns to Betty and says,</p><p>"Have you been a pure and honest woman?"</p><p>"My good man," replies Betty, "I am English. I have been honest and
clean my whole life."</p><p>"Okay, okay," says Peter, checking his list. "Follow that angel to
the pink room." Then Peter turns to Margaret. "And have you been a pure,
forthright woman?" "Oh Peter," replies Margaret, "I have been as pure as
the driven snow."</p><p>"Okay," says Peter, checking his list, "follow that angel to the pink
room." Then he turns to Lolita. "And have you been honest and pure?"</p><p>"I never did-a no harm to anyone," replies Lolita. "I could-a say I
was honest. I loved love.</p><p>And I was-a pure. I loved loving purely for love, and only for love."
"Okay," says Peter, dropping his list, "follow me to my room!" Nivedano

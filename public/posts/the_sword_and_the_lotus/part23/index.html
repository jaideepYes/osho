THE ULTIMATE IN ALL ITS POWER, EXISTENCE, FULLNESS, COULD HAVE HELPED CREATION ON A MALE-MALE BASIS, ON A FEMALE-FEMALE BASIS, OR A JOINED TOGETHER BASIS, AS A THEOSOPHIST ONCE EXPLAINED. HE WROTE THAT AT THE TIME OF CREATION THE HUMAN CREATURES, MALE AND FEMALE, WERE BORN JOINED TOGETHER AT BIRTH AND THEY WALKED ON FOUR LEGS.\nOF COURSE, THE ULTIMATE IN ALL ITS POWER COULD HAVE SOLVED THE PROBLEM OF PROGENY IN A DIFFERENT WAY FROM THAT WHICH WE KNOW NOW.\nIS THIS A QUESTION WHICH IS SOLVABLE, OR WILL IT BE BETTER TO HAVE IT ADDED AS UNKNOWN TO LIMITED THINKING, TO THE MIND AS SUCH?\nThere are many questions which are created by man himself; they don’t have any roots in reality.\nFirst, man starts with assumptions and slowly, slowly forgets that the assumption is not reality. For example, the question of the ultimate – that in the beginning it was one, then why did it become two? It is absolutely man’s creation – the whole idea.\nNobody has any right to talk about the beginning, because nobody could have been a witness to it for the simple reason that if there was a witness, it was not a beginning. The witness was there – the beginning must have been some time before the witness. It is a simple, rational and logical understanding that to talk about the beginning is all nonsense.\nChristians say that in the beginning was the word. Now this is sheer stupidity because ‘word’ means a sound with a meaning, and meaning is impossible unless there is somebody to give it meaning.\nOne thing is certain: in the beginning there cannot be a word. It would have been better if they had chosen sound – but just better, not right. Even to accept that in the beginning there was only sound, you need some ears to hear it. Without ears there is no sound. This is something scientific which you have to understand.\nFor example, you see my robe is green. It is one of the very strange things that science has come to discover that when the light rays fall on anything... the light rays have all the seven colors of the rainbow.…\nOn my robe the light rays are falling. The robe is absorbing all the colors except green; that means this robe is not green at all. It is an appearance, and the appearance is possible because it is not accepting the green ray, so the green ray hits your eye. All other colors are absorbed, so they don’t come back to your eyes. Only the green is left; it hits your eye, and naturally your eyes see it green. This robe can be any color, but it is not green, in fact it has no color – only when light falls on it does it have a certain quality of absorbing.\nBut if you all close your eyes, including me, then this robe will not be green. Then all your clothes will lose their colors, because for colors to exist, eyes are needed.\nTake it from a different angle.… Common sense thinks that a blind man lives in darkness – that is absolutely wrong. The blind man has no eyes; he cannot see darkness. To see darkness you need eyes, and if you can see darkness, who is preventing you from seeing light? The blind man does not know anything about light, nor about darkness. The deaf person does not know anything about sound, and he does not know anything about silence. If there was nobody present and there was only sound – it is impossible, scientifically impossible, because sound can exist only with ears. Unless the eardrums are struck, there is no sound.\nIt would have been better if they had chosen silence, but still not right because even for silence somebody is needed to feel it. If there is nobody, silence cannot exist.\nWhat I am trying to show to you is that the very idea of one in the beginning is an assumption. In fact, one cannot exist without two; two cannot exist without three; three cannot exist without four... ad infinitum. If one exists, that means one digit of an infinity; otherwise, one has no meaning. What meaning will you give to one?\nYou can say it is not two, but you have brought two into it. You can say it is not three, but you have brought three into it.\nThese are all assumptions, and once we accept them then they create a thousand and one problems. Then the problem arises: if there was only one in the beginning...\nThe questioner has been an ambassador to England from Nepal. He is well educated, but even he is not aware of a simple fact: who told you that in the beginning there was one? On what grounds do you accept the ultimate “in the beginning”? Who told you that there has ever been a beginning?\nAs far as I am concerned there has never been a beginning. Existence has always been here, and there is going to be no end. Existence is going to be always here.\nChanges may go on happening – new forms, new beings – but the inner core of existence is eternal. And all the philosophies talking about beginnings are childish. But this is a problem – once you accept an assumption without questioning it, you are getting into trouble.\nAnd that’s what happened to the theosophists.… They accepted the ultimate “in the beginning...” then they had to accept that there was a time and there will be a time again when man and woman will be born together, joined together, and will walk on all fours. And this is not only for theosophy, theosophy is a very new movement. It developed in the last century, and it has died out. It has no significance anymore.\nJainism is the most ancient religion in the world. It also has a similar kind of theory – a little bit different, but the idea is based on the same assumption. Jainism believes that in the beginning, satyuga, the age of truth, every child was born with his partner – one boy, one girl, together; they were twins, not joined. A man and woman joined together, walking on four legs, looks absolutely ugly. I don’t think it is a development, it looks more like a cartoon than like a spiritual ideology.\nJainism has a far better idea: a boy and girl were always born together. They were not brother and sister as it turned out later on; they were husband and wife. That’s why the Sanskrit word bhagini has two meanings. Very strange... one meaning is sister; the other meaning is wife. The meaning wife is older, but soon people realized that if twins marry, their children don’t survive. Even if they survive they are weak, intellectually retarded, will have some kind of physical weakness.\nOnce it was realized the process was stopped. And the word ‘bhagini’, which used to mean ‘wife’, started to have a new meaning, ‘sister’, which is a very different meaning. And still the Sanskrit dictionaries carry both the meanings.\nBasically the word is very beautiful. It means two persons who have shared the same womb. It says nothing about time – whether they shared the womb together or at different times – but that they shared the same womb. People decided it should mean sister, and that it was an ugliness in the beginning when twins started marrying. But they had thought that it was a gift of nature, that nature had chosen who was going to be your wife. Where, in this whole world, will you choose who is made for you? The best way is to have both be born together. But genetics and gynecology studies all agree on one point – that the man and wife should be as far away from each other as possible. Then their children will be better physically, mentally, spiritually.\nWe are using it for animals, but we are not scientific enough to understand the thing. We use crossbreeding with animals... you bring English bulls for your cows. If you were really scientifically minded, you would find husbands for your daughters in faraway countries, wives for your sons in faraway countries, so there is no blood relationship possible. That would raise the human quality... age, intelligence, health, everything. But these ideas of why the one became two... It never became two; it has always been two.\nAnd why is there so much of a problem about two? The two are complementary. They make one organic whole, but they are not one. Existence is dialectical. It uses opposites as tension. Now the questioner is asking why God did not only make men, and that he could have made the whole of existence on the same basis. It would have been a very colorless, dull, boring existence – just males wherever you go... horses, elephants, camels – all males. You would not find something attractive, because attraction needs some difference. And the opposite, the polar opposite, is the most attractive.\nExistence is dialectical: it is male-female; it is positive-negative. And recently, it has been proved beyond doubt that in Africa, in Europe, in America, one of the most dangerous diseases ever is spreading – AIDS. No other disease can be compared to it because there is no cure for it, and scientists are almost certain that there will be no cure for it. The disease is such that they cannot conceive of any cure. And the person has to die within two years, at the most, two years.\nGenerally, people will die within six to eight months. If they live in a very controlled atmosphere they may survive two years at the most. Death is absolutely certain. This disease has happened through homosexuality, and that’s what you are asking in the question: why God has not created, why the ultimate has not created a single foundation, male and male.\nThe disease has arisen out of homosexuality – one male making love to another male. Something seems to be very much against existence.\nScientists have not yet come to a conclusion about what is causing AIDS, but my understanding is that when a man starts loving another man, the woman within both the men starts dying, because she no longer has any nourishment. She is ignored, she shrinks, and slowly, slowly she dies. And when the woman in you dies, half of you is dead.\nYou have become only half alive. And the other half was your resistance against diseases, it was your organic support. Now you don’t have any support. You have lost contact with nature’s dialectics – this is the cause of the disease AIDS. The patient becomes vulnerable to all kinds of diseases, he has no resistance; any infection and he will get it. He cannot fight any infection; no medicine can cure him of any infection – he lives almost like a ghost.\nI am worried that there are lesbians also, particularly in the West – women loving women. Sooner or later they will bring an even bigger disease than AIDS.\nIt took a long time for AIDS to happen. Homosexuality must be as old as your religions, because religions are the cause of homosexuality. They forced men to remain as monks separate from women. The women became nuns, but they could not meet the monks, they had to live separately. So homosexuality and lesbianism are both created by your so-called religions. The whole credit goes to your great religions.\nBut it took thousands of years for AIDS to happen. Perhaps the woman is more strong... she is. Scientifically she is more strong than a man. That’s why lesbianism may take still a few hundred years before a greater disease than AIDS grips women. But it is going to come – you cannot survive against nature. You can go against it. It gives you enough rope, enough freedom. You can use it for your spiritual growth, you can use it to destroy yourself. And what is the problem if the universe functions through polar opposites?\nHe is also asking... perhaps he thinks that the way men and women make love is ugly, so he is asking if the ultimate could not create some other way for reproduction, for progeny. Anything would cause the same question.\nI will tell you a story.…\nIt happened in the twenty-first century. One couple, very adventurous, went for a space tour. They reached a planet where something exactly like human beings had been living for thousands of years. They were immensely happy. The first house they entered, the people were very generous, very loving – they offered coffee. They drank the coffee and soon they were discussing things. And both the couples, from the earth and from the new planet, were interested in how children were created in their worlds.\nThe man and woman felt a little embarrassed. They said, “First you show how you create children.” They said, “It is very simple.”\nThey opened their refrigerator...\nThe couple from the earth was amazed: “What are they doing? What has a refrigerator got to do with creating children?”\n... and they brought two bottles, one with some green liquid, one with some red liquid, and a big jar. And they mixed the liquid from both the bottles in the big jar.\nThe couple from the earth was laughing: “What are you doing? Have you gone mad?”\nThey said, “This is the way we make children. Now this jar will remain in the refrigerator for nine months, and after nine months you have a baby – you take it out of the jar.”\nThe earth couple said, “My God! This is the way we make instant coffee. What a strange method you have got.”\nThey said, “It may look strange to you, but this is how it has always been done here on this planet. Now you show how you do it.”\nThey had to show, because they had promised. They were feeling a little embarrassed, but not afraid, because nobody from the earth was present and these people... idiots, mixing liquids from jars and waiting for nine monthsThey could not believe that there was going to be a baby. They\ndropped their clothes and started making love.\nAnd both the people from the new planet were rolling on the ground with laughter. They could not believe it: “What are you doing?”\nThe man was doing push-ups on top of the woman!\nThey said, “You idiots! This is the way we make coffee! This is not the way to produce children!”\nIt does not matter – anything would have been questionable. And I think the way things are, it is perfectly good. In fact, to make coffee in this way would be a little dangerous. And hearing that this was the way they made coffee, they both felt so bad because they had already drunk the coffee!\nExistence is dialectical.\nThere has never been one, and there will never be one. It knows a certain kind of oneness, but that is the organic unity of the two.\nYes, a man like Gautam Buddha knows oneness, but that too is dialectical. His inner woman and his inner man have come together to meet in a deep, orgasmic unity. From the outside you see him alone – he is not. In existence nothing can exist alone. To exist you need the support of the opposite, either from the outside or from the inside. If you can find the support from inside then certainly you have immense freedom, you are no longer dependent on the other.\nWith the inner unity you cannot produce children, but you can go on reproducing yourself; you can go on giving a new birth to yourself. Each moment becomes a new birth and you go on higher and higher in peace, in silence, in bliss, in ecstasy... and it has no limits.\nThe sky may have limits, but the growth of the spiritual organic unity within you has no limits. But remember, it is an organic unity between two polar opposites.\nEvery man is a woman also, and every woman is a man also. So you can manage an inner unity – and that is real celibacy. The celibacy that is being taught by the religions – I condemn it because that is not celibacy... renouncing the woman, hating, getting away from the woman.…\nPerhaps in hating the woman or the man you may start hating all that is feminine, or all that is male inside you too. You may never be able to accept your inner woman. If you could not accept the outer how can you accept the inner? You will try to kill it in every possible way. But by killing it you will be committing suicide. It will not be spiritual growth, it will simply be spiritual suicide.\nThat’s what I see in your saints. Look into their eyes and you will not find life. Look into their life and you will not find joy. Look into their being and you will not find a dance, a song. All is dead. Their body has become just a grave and they are somehow dragging it towards the graveyard. Their only juice upon which they live is your respect for them. That gives them enough ego – your respectability, your calling them great saints, mahatmas... That is the only thing they have got – which is absolutely bogus, but you go on giving that, not knowing that you are helping them to commit suicide, that you are also part in their crime, that you are committing a tremendous sin.\nThe whole idea should be dropped. There cannot be any beginning. How can there be a beginning? From where will all these things come? And if you can get all these things from somewhere, then this is not a beginning. Places exist from where you are getting all these things; contractors exist who are making all these things; suppliers exist who are ready to supply all that you want...\nOut of nothing, do you think there can be a beginning? And there cannot be an end, because where will all this disappear to?\nScientists say you cannot destroy even a single small piece of stone – there is no way to destroy it. You can cut it into smaller pieces, but still it is there. You can do whatsoever you want, but it will remain in some form or other. You cannot simply destroy it so that it leaves no mark behind. This is one of the basic discoveries of modern science – that nothing is destructible. If nothing is destructible, then the other end should also be understood: it is not possible to create anything. If you cannot destroy anything, you cannot create either.\nWe have not been successful in creating anything. Whatever we do is only combinations. You can create water by the combination of oxygen and hydrogen, but they are still there. It is not a creation, it is only a composition.\nYou take something from one place, something from another place, and you can make a new thing – but it is not new. Neither has there ever been a creation, nor is there going to be a destruction. There is no god who created, there is no ultimate being who managed to run the world in a dialectical way.\nExistence is autonomous and it is eternal. But the problem with theologians, with philosophers, is that they simply invent a name and they forget that their beginning is only invention, imagination. Then they go on questioning and then they go on answering, making a big system.\nI have looked into all the systems of philosophy, I have wasted almost my whole life in looking into all the systems of the world, and only one thing that is similar to all of them is that they don’t have any base. Their basis is simply assumption.\nIf you accept their assumption then their whole system looks very logical, very profound. They are all afraid that you should ask anything about their basis, because they don’t have any answer. And the basis is the first thing to ask about. The differences in their systems are not much, because their bases are all false; the differences are only of names. Somebody calls it absolute, somebody calls it ultimate, somebody calls it god, somebody calls it some other name. All these names are imaginary, and by changing names nothing is changed.\nJust look – as I was telling you, the Bible says, “In the beginning was the word...” The second sentence contradicts the first: “With the word was God...”\nAnd no Christian has the guts to question that in the second sentence, the first is denied. “In the beginning was the word...” The second sentence is, “With the word, there was God...” So the word was not alone. And in the third sentence it is said that God was the word.\nCan’t you see the contradiction? – so apparent. Then why don’t you simply say, “In the beginning there was God”? Why say, “the word”? “The word was with God...” And finally, you come to the real thing: “The word was God.” Why go this long way? Those first two sentences are meaningless. You should have said, “In the beginning was God.”\nBut to protect God, so that God is not questioned... People will question the word and will get puzzled with the word, so they have created a great philosophy about the word and what it means for the word to be there. They have made a protection for poor God. But anybody who has eyes cannot be deceived.\nI am reminded.…\nIt happened in Bombay that a Hindu saint who used to come there always had a big following. He was delivering his morning talk, and a very rich lady was sitting in front of him with her small child who suddenly said, “Mummy, I want to go to the bathroom.”\nEverybody laughed because the talk was about Vedanta the ultimate god, and suddenly that boy brings the bathroom in.\nThe mother tried to push him, “Sit down.” He said, “I cannot! I want to piss.”\nEverybody was laughing, and the saint felt very embarrassed. But the woman was very rich so he could not say anything to her. And he was a guest in the same woman’s house, he had been there for many years. But after the meeting he called the woman separately and told her, “You should teach your child some etiquette. In a spiritual meeting he talked about the bathroom and pissing, and that created such a disturbance that all my seriousness was lost and people must have forgotten all the great things that I was saying. That boy is a real devil. Either you should not bring him with you or you should teach him something.”\nThe woman said, “He insists on coming. And he is my only child and I cannot leave him crying and weeping at home. I will not be able to sit listening to you peacefully because I will remember that he will be weeping and crying.”\nThen the saint said, “I suggest a simple thing to you. You just tell him that if you want to go to the bathroom you need not say that you want to piss, you can simply teach him to change the word ‘piss’. Instead of saying ‘pissing’, say ‘singing’: ‘Mom, I want to sing.’ Nobody will know what is going on; it will be a code language. And this is not difficult. Make it clear: ‘If you learn this, only then will I take you with me; otherwise no.’”\nThe boy agreed. He said, “There is no problem for me. Whenever I feel, I will say that I want to sing. You have to understand, don’t forget!”\nAfter one year the saint came back. He was staying in the same lady’s house and just in the evening the lady said, “I am in a trouble. One of my sisters is seriously sick and I have to go to see her. I may not be able to come back in the night. The child is alone. It will be great kindness if you let him sleep with you in the bed because he has never slept alone.”\nThe saint said, “There is no problem.” The woman left.\nIn the middle of the night the child shook the saint and said, “I want to sing.”\nThe saint said, “Are you mad? Is this the time for singing? In the middle of the night, disturbing all the neighbors...? Shut up and go to sleep.”\nThe boy remained silent for a few minutes. He said, “It is difficult to shut up. You have to allow me to sing – it is coming.”\nThe saint said, “What nonsense. The whole day I have been teaching people and in the night you won’t let me sleep, and your mother has left you in my care. I tell you, go to sleep. If you want to sing, sing in the morning!”\nHe said, “I can’t wait that long. You don’t understand. I have to sing NOW.”\nSo the saint said, “It seems you won’t listen, so okay, sing but sing very quietly. Just come close to my ear; sing in a whisper... nobody hears.”\nThe boy said, “I warn you.” He said, “Don’t tell me later on. It seems you don’t know what singing means.”\nThe saint said, “You think you know more than me? You just sing whatsoever you want to. Be finished and go to bed!”\nHalf asleep, the saint suddenly jumped when the boy started “singing” in his ear.… He said, “My God! This you call singing!”\nHe said, “It is your teaching... you told my mother.… Otherwise I was always telling the truth. You made me a hypocrite, now suffer.”\nAnd the saint said, “This is something. Could you not tell me what singing means?”\nHe said, “That was the whole point – to hide the thing that it means. I thought that you have given the suggestion so you must know.”\nYou can change the words but you cannot change reality. You can call it singing, you can call it dancing, you can call it anything, but if it is pissing, it is pissing.\nMy approach is absolutely scientific and existential. I don’t have any assumptions. I cannot tell you that existence ever began, because I am not a witness to it. And I cannot conceive of anybody being a witness to it; it will be a contradiction. And if there has been no beginning, there cannot be any end. Things end only if they have a beginning.\nAnd I don’t see that there is anything wrong in the reproductive system; it is perfectly good except for your so-called religious people who have been condemning sex. Sex has nothing to be condemned. It is sacred because it gives birth to life. It has given birth to you. It has given birth to Gautam Buddha... it has given birth to all that we are proud of.\nYou go on condemning the very origin. You want some changes, but what changes? any change will be questionable. So I don’t see any point in questioning.\nI accept nature as it is.\nAnd I accept it with gratitude, thankfulness. It is the most beautiful existence possible.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED MASTER,\nAS ONE GROWS OLD, ONE’S IDEAS SLOWLY CHANGE. ARE YOUR IDEAS ABOUT SEX TO SUPERCONSCIOUSNESS THE SAME? YOUR COMMENT PLEASE.\nPerhaps you are not aware that there are two kinds of growth. Most people grow old; a few people simply grow up. I belong to the second category. I don’t grow old, I simply grow up.\nThe body will grow old, but the body has nothing to do with my ideas. My consciousness grows up.\nI have more profound ideas about sex and superconsciousness than I had before. There has been evolution about everything in me, but whatever I have said before has deepened, has become more solid. Now I have more arguments for it – that’s what growing up means. Nothing has changed, only everything has become more clear, more solid, more conclusive.\nI have been thinking to speak – because I have never read my books – on each book again, so that you can see that I have not contradicted a single thing in those books. Although I have gone far away from those ideas, it is in favor of those books, not against them.\nWhatever I have said after my enlightenment is unchangeable. It can evolve, it can grow, it can bring more flowers to it, it can have deeper roots in the ground, but its quality, its taste will remain the same.\nAnd I hope that my sannyasins will learn to grow up, not just to grow old. Even animals grow old – buffaloes, donkeys – everybody grows old. It is only man’s prerogative, his privilege, to grow up.\nThe body will take its own course, but your consciousness can go on growing up, can go on growing even when you are dying, can go on growing when you are dead, can go on growing wherever you are. That growth is eternal.\nQuestion 3 BELOVED MASTER,\nSEERS HAVE SAID – GURU RAMA, GURU VISHNU, GURU DEVA MAHESHWAR – THAT THE MASTER IS THE GENERATOR, THE OPERATOR AND THE DESTROYER.\nI CANNOT CONCEIVE HOW IT CAN BE TRUE. PLEASE ENLIGHTEN ME.\nThe Hindu mythology has something equal to the Christian trinity. It is called the trimurti, the three faces of god – Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh. These are not three persons, but only three faces of one person.\nBrahma creates the world; Vishnu maintains it, sustains it, nourishes it; and Shiva destroys it. This is one cycle.\nThen another cycle begins: Brahma creates again, and so on, so forth. It is just a mythology, but mythologies have been so heavy on man’s mind that sometimes it is hilarious to see.\nBrahma is the creator of the world, but in India there is only one temple devoted to Brahma. Because who cares about Brahma? He has done his work, he is useless. He may be a god, a great god. He created the whole world, but he has no longer any worshippers. Just a single temple is devoted to him. You can see the mind of the people.\nI will not talk about the theology but its implication. Most of the temples are of Vishnu, or his incarnations – Krishna, Ram – these are all incarnations of Vishnu. Most of the temples are of Vishnu because he has the power, and power has to be worshipped. Right now he is everything, he can do everything, he can change everything – he is all powerful.\nShiva also has millions of statues, but not many temples. That too is very significant. Vishnu’s temples are immensely rich, with great art, sculpture, beauty. Shiva is the poorest god. You can find any axe-shaped marble stone, put it under any tree and it becomes a temple of Shiva.\nWho cares about death, destruction? But people are afraid. So once in a while, placing a few flowers is perfectly understandable. But no great temples have been raised for Shiva. He lives under trees in the hot sun, in the rain, in the cold. People worship him just out of fear.\nFear can never become worship; neither can business ever become worship. Vishnu is people’s business; Shiva is the god of death, god of destruction. He has to be kept friendly – he is dangerous.\nAnother example you will find – you can look in the books of all the businessmen in India. I don’t know, it must be the same in Nepal – every businessman starts his books with Shri Ganeshaya Namah – Ganesh is Shiva’s son. Why is it that every book all over India, and wherever Hinduism has had any influence, starts with Shri Ganeshaya Namah – I bow down to Shri Ganesh, the great god? All other gods are forgotten. The reason is that in the beginning Ganesh was a very mischievous fellow – he used to harm, to disturb. Just to keep him calm and cool – “Please don’t disturb our business” – people started praising him: Shri Ganeshaya Namah. It was not out of respect, it was a bribery because he was a great destroyer. He was the son of the ultimate god of destruction and he used to play mischief all around. He would disturb people’s marriages, people’s businesses, so everything that has to be started has first to remember Ganesh.\nThis is not religion. This is simply persuading Ganesh: “Don’t disturb us – we are on your side. We are not your enemies, we are worshippers...” Mythologies which have no reality in them – you can see Ganesh and you can understand that this cannot be a reality. Ganesh has the body of a man and the head of an elephant. This is not possible. And above all this nonsense, having the head of an elephant, a big belly because he loves laddus – and he is sitting on a mouse! That is his vehicle. Can you conceive it? Is it possible? That poor mouse carrying the whole load of a full wagon would have died long ago.\nBut people never ask, never question their own mythologies. The same is true about Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh – just creations of the human mind. The world has never been created so there is no need of any Brahma. And it is not going to be destroyed, so there is no need of any Shiva. And between the two is Vishnu.\nThe world is autonomous, it does not need anybody to maintain it. But all over the world people have strange kinds of mythologies dominating their minds. And they have devoted millions of hours, money, artists, to make temples for these imaginations. And then to look at people worshipping their own imaginary gods is so ridiculous.\nMy father used to take me to a temple which was very close. It was a very beautiful Jaina temple with a standing statue of Mahavira, an ancient statue. I loved the peace of the temple. I loved the statue, its art, but I never felt like worshipping. A statue has to be appreciated as a beautiful object of art, there is no question of worship. You don’t worship the painting of Picasso.\nAnd my father would say to me, “You have to worship Mahavira because he is equivalent in Jainism to the supreme god. He has the same qualities. He is omnipotent, omnipresent, omniscient – he can see everything: past, present, future. He is everywhere present and he is all powerful.”\nI told him, “To tell you the truth, I have seen a mouse sitting on his head pissing, and your great saint Mahavira could not do anything. Perhaps he could not see above his head. All powerful? Everywhere present? And he could not even throw the mouse away? I have seen it with my own eyes, and if you want to see it I can bring a white mouse which my friend has, and I can manage the whole scene again. I can bring another friend who is a photographer and we will distribute the photograph all over the town: ‘This is your omnipresent, omnipotent, omniscient god – now stop worshipping!’ He has lost power over rats, what can he do for you?”\nHe said, “Don’t do any such thing. If you don’t want to worship, keep quiet.”\nI said, “You have to keep quiet. This was just an instance for you so you don’t continue harassing me that I have to worship.”\nThis is man’s creation – beautiful. It should be kept in a museum, but it is not to be worshipped. For worshipping you have the whole universe which is not man’s creation – the stars in the night, the sunrise in the morning, the sunset in the evening, a bird on the wing... But I have never seen any religious person worshipping all that is not man-made and has such tremendous beauty, so much alive. And we are part of it, and you go on worshipping a stone that you yourself have named. That much for the mythology part.\nBut your question is that the seers have said that the master is all – he is Brahma the creator, he is Vishnu the maintainer, he is Shiva the destroyer. This is the ugliest thing that anybody can write. And these seers are writing about themselves that they are the masters. You worship them because they are all three in one. They are Brahma, they are Vishnu, they are Mahesh.\nWhere are you going to worship in the temples when the master is present?\nThis is the ugliest part in it. If some disciple had written it, it would have been understandable – his gratitude. But the gurus, the so-called masters are writing these lines and they have been perpetuated for centuries. Nobody has even questioned that this self-appraisal is simply ugly, disgusting.\nI have heard that one day Mulla Nasruddin came into the restaurant and declared, “My wife is the most beautiful woman in the world.”\nEverybody was shocked, everybody knew his wife... he himself knew it.\nPeople gathered around him and said, “Mulla, have you had a revelation? Who told you? Has she been chosen Miss Universe? What has happened that you have to declare?”\nHe said, “She has not been chosen, she has told me herself. I am a faithful servant. Whatever she says I believe it. She said that she is the most beautiful woman, and I said, perfectly right; I will go and tell my friends.”\nThe seers themselves are saying to you that they are better than Brahma, better than Vishnu, better than Mahesh, because those gods have only one quality each and they have all the three qualities together.\nIt is possible for a disciple who loves the master to call him God, because he has seen something of godliness for the first time in his life. But if the master himself declares that he is the god then it is ridiculous. Then it is not worth consideration at all.\nThose seers are simply being stupid. This kind of statement makes one think that they must have been idiotic. This is so egoistic – you cannot find any other statement which is more egoistic. These are the people who are teaching everybody to drop the ego, and they are the biggest egoists in the world.\nI would like to say to you that any master who claims that you have to worship him is no longer considered to be a master. A real master can only be a friend, not a god.\nIt is possible for the disciple to feel the godliness of the master – that is another matter. Question 4\nBELOVED MASTER,\nWHAT OF JAINA AND SUFI RELIGIONS – IS THERE ANY GENUINE MASTER IN THE PRESENT MOMENT ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD?\nPLEASE GIVE SOME LIGHT ON THIS MATTER.\nCan’t you see the light?\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"6639","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_sword_and_the_lotus/part23/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_sword_and_the_lotus/>The Sword and the Lotus</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">23 No beginning \-- no end</h1><div class=post-meta>32 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;6639 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Sword_and_the_Lotus/part23.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part22>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

PUZZLED: WHY DOES THE ULTIMATE, WHICH WAS ONE, HAVE TO BE IMMEDIATELY
TWO AFTER CREATION? IN OTHER WORDS, POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE, MALE AND
FEMALE, AND SO ON. THE ULTIMATE IN ALL ITS POWER, EXISTENCE, FULLNESS,
COULD HAVE HELPED CREATION ON A MALE-MALE BASIS, ON A FEMALE-FEMALE
BASIS, OR A JOINED TOGETHER BASIS, AS A THEOSOPHIST ONCE EXPLAINED. HE
WROTE THAT AT THE TIME OF CREATION THE HUMAN CREATURES, MALE AND FEMALE,
WERE BORN JOINED TOGETHER AT BIRTH AND THEY WALKED ON FOUR LEGS.</p><p><br></p><p>OF COURSE, THE ULTIMATE IN ALL ITS POWER COULD HAVE SOLVED THE
PROBLEM OF PROGENY IN A DIFFERENT WAY FROM THAT WHICH WE KNOW NOW.</p><p><br></p><p>IS THIS A QUESTION WHICH IS SOLVABLE, OR WILL IT BE BETTER TO HAVE IT
ADDED AS UNKNOWN TO LIMITED THINKING, TO THE MIND AS SUCH?</p><p><br></p><p>There are many questions which are created by man himself; they don’t
have any roots in reality.</p><p><br></p><p>First, man starts with assumptions and slowly, slowly forgets that
the assumption is not reality. For example, the question of the ultimate
– that in the beginning it was one, then why did it become two? It is
absolutely man’s creation – the whole idea.</p><p>Nobody has any right to talk about the beginning, because nobody
could have been a witness to it for the simple reason that if there was
a witness, it was not a beginning. The witness was there – the beginning
must have been some time before the witness. It is a simple, rational
and logical understanding that to talk about the beginning is all
nonsense.</p><p><br></p><p>Christians say that in the beginning was the word. Now this is sheer
stupidity because ‘word’ means a sound with a meaning, and meaning is
impossible unless there is somebody to give it meaning.</p><p><br></p><p>One thing is certain: in the beginning there cannot be a word. It
would have been better if they had chosen sound – but just better, not
right. Even to accept that in the beginning there was only sound, you
need some ears to hear it. Without ears there is no sound. This is
something scientific which you have to understand.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, you see my robe is green. It is one of the very strange
things that science has come to discover that when the light rays fall
on anything... the light rays have all the seven colors of the
rainbow.…</p><p><br></p><p>On my robe the light rays are falling. The robe is absorbing all the
colors except green; that means this robe is not green at all. It is an
appearance, and the appearance is possible because it is not accepting
the green ray, so the green ray hits your eye. All other colors are
absorbed, so they don’t come back to your eyes. Only the green is left;
it hits your eye, and naturally your eyes see it green. This robe can be
any color, but it is not green, in fact it has no color – only when
light falls on it does it have a certain quality of absorbing.</p><p><br></p><p>But if you all close your eyes, including me, then this robe will not
be green. Then all your clothes will lose their colors, because for
colors to exist, eyes are needed.</p><p><br></p><p>Take it from a different angle.… Common sense thinks that a blind man
lives in darkness – that is absolutely wrong. The blind man has no eyes;
he cannot see darkness. To see darkness you need eyes, and if you can
see darkness, who is preventing you from seeing light? The blind man
does not know anything about light, nor about darkness. The deaf person
does not know anything about sound, and he does not know anything about
silence. If there was nobody present and there was only sound – it is
impossible, scientifically impossible, because sound can exist only with
ears. Unless the eardrums are struck, there is no sound.</p><p><br></p><p>It would have been better if they had chosen silence, but still not
right because even for silence somebody is needed to feel it. If there
is nobody, silence cannot exist.</p><p><br></p><p>What I am trying to show to you is that the very idea of one in the
beginning is an assumption. In fact, one cannot exist without two; two
cannot exist without three; three cannot exist without four... ad
infinitum. If one exists, that means one digit of an infinity;
otherwise, one has no meaning. What meaning will you give to one?</p><p><br></p><p>You can say it is not two, but you have brought two into it. You can
say it is not three, but you have brought three into it.</p><p><br></p><p>These are all assumptions, and once we accept them then they create a
thousand and one problems. Then the problem arises: if there was only
one in the beginning...</p><p>The questioner has been an ambassador to England from Nepal. He is
well educated, but even he is not aware of a simple fact: who told you
that in the beginning there was one? On what grounds do you accept the
ultimate “in the beginning”? Who told you that there has ever been a
beginning?</p><p><br></p><p>As far as I am concerned there has never been a beginning. Existence
has always been here, and there is going to be no end. Existence is
going to be always here.</p><p><br></p><p>Changes may go on happening – new forms, new beings – but the inner
core of existence is eternal. And all the philosophies talking about
beginnings are childish. But this is a problem – once you accept an
assumption without questioning it, you are getting into trouble.</p><p><br></p><p>And that’s what happened to the theosophists.… They accepted the
ultimate “in the beginning...” then they had to accept that there was a
time and there will be a time again when man and woman will be born
together, joined together, and will walk on all fours. And this is not
only for theosophy, theosophy is a very new movement. It developed in
the last century, and it has died out. It has no significance
anymore.</p><p><br></p><p>Jainism is the most ancient religion in the world. It also has a
similar kind of theory – a little bit different, but the idea is based
on the same assumption. Jainism believes that in the beginning, satyuga,
the age of truth, every child was born with his partner – one boy, one
girl, together; they were twins, not joined. A man and woman joined
together, walking on four legs, looks absolutely ugly. I don’t think it
is a development, it looks more like a cartoon than like a spiritual
ideology.</p><p><br></p><p>Jainism has a far better idea: a boy and girl were always born
together. They were not brother and sister as it turned out later on;
they were husband and wife. That’s why the Sanskrit word bhagini has two
meanings. Very strange... one meaning is sister; the other meaning is
wife. The meaning wife is older, but soon people realized that if twins
marry, their children don’t survive. Even if they survive they are weak,
intellectually retarded, will have some kind of physical weakness.</p><p><br></p><p>Once it was realized the process was stopped. And the word ‘bhagini’,
which used to mean ‘wife’, started to have a new meaning, ‘sister’,
which is a very different meaning. And still the Sanskrit dictionaries
carry both the meanings.</p><p><br></p><p>Basically the word is very beautiful. It means two persons who have
shared the same womb. It says nothing about time – whether they shared
the womb together or at different times – but that they shared the same
womb. People decided it should mean sister, and that it was an ugliness
in the beginning when twins started marrying. But they had thought that
it was a gift of nature, that nature had chosen who was going to be your
wife. Where, in this whole world, will you choose who is made for you?
The best way is to have both be born together. But genetics and
gynecology studies all agree on one point – that the man and wife should
be as far away from each other as possible. Then their children will be
better physically, mentally, spiritually.</p><p><br></p><p>We are using it for animals, but we are not scientific enough to
understand the thing. We use crossbreeding with animals... you bring
English bulls for your cows. If you were really scientifically minded,
you would find husbands for your daughters in faraway countries, wives
for your sons in faraway countries, so there is no blood relationship
possible. That would raise the human quality... age, intelligence,
health, everything. But these ideas of why the one became two... It
never became two; it has always been two.</p><p>And why is there so much of a problem about two? The two are
complementary. They make one organic whole, but they are not one.
Existence is dialectical. It uses opposites as tension. Now the
questioner is asking why God did not only make men, and that he could
have made the whole of existence on the same basis. It would have been a
very colorless, dull, boring existence – just males wherever you go...
horses, elephants, camels – all males. You would not find something
attractive, because attraction needs some difference. And the opposite,
the polar opposite, is the most attractive.</p><p><br></p><p>Existence is dialectical: it is male-female; it is positive-negative.
And recently, it has been proved beyond doubt that in Africa, in Europe,
in America, one of the most dangerous diseases ever is spreading – AIDS.
No other disease can be compared to it because there is no cure for it,
and scientists are almost certain that there will be no cure for it. The
disease is such that they cannot conceive of any cure. And the person
has to die within two years, at the most, two years.</p><p><br></p><p>Generally, people will die within six to eight months. If they live
in a very controlled atmosphere they may survive two years at the most.
Death is absolutely certain. This disease has happened through
homosexuality, and that’s what you are asking in the question: why God
has not created, why the ultimate has not created a single foundation,
male and male.</p><p><br></p><p>The disease has arisen out of homosexuality – one male making love to
another male. Something seems to be very much against existence.</p><p><br></p><p>Scientists have not yet come to a conclusion about what is causing
AIDS, but my understanding is that when a man starts loving another man,
the woman within both the men starts dying, because she no longer has
any nourishment. She is ignored, she shrinks, and slowly, slowly she
dies. And when the woman in you dies, half of you is dead.</p><p><br></p><p>You have become only half alive. And the other half was your
resistance against diseases, it was your organic support. Now you don’t
have any support. You have lost contact with nature’s dialectics – this
is the cause of the disease AIDS. The patient becomes vulnerable to all
kinds of diseases, he has no resistance; any infection and he will get
it. He cannot fight any infection; no medicine can cure him of any
infection – he lives almost like a ghost.</p><p><br></p><p>I am worried that there are lesbians also, particularly in the West –
women loving women. Sooner or later they will bring an even bigger
disease than AIDS.</p><p><br></p><p>It took a long time for AIDS to happen. Homosexuality must be as old
as your religions, because religions are the cause of homosexuality.
They forced men to remain as monks separate from women. The women became
nuns, but they could not meet the monks, they had to live separately. So
homosexuality and lesbianism are both created by your so-called
religions. The whole credit goes to your great religions.</p><p><br></p><p>But it took thousands of years for AIDS to happen. Perhaps the woman
is more strong... she is. Scientifically she is more strong than a man.
That’s why lesbianism may take still a few hundred years before a
greater disease than AIDS grips women. But it is going to come – you
cannot survive against nature. You can go against it. It gives you
enough rope, enough freedom. You can use it for your spiritual growth,
you can use it to destroy yourself. And what is the problem if the
universe functions through polar opposites?</p><p>He is also asking... perhaps he thinks that the way men and women
make love is ugly, so he is asking if the ultimate could not create some
other way for reproduction, for progeny. Anything would cause the same
question.</p><p><br></p><p>I will tell you a story.…</p><p><br></p><p>It happened in the twenty-first century. One couple, very
adventurous, went for a space tour. They reached a planet where
something exactly like human beings had been living for thousands of
years. They were immensely happy. The first house they entered, the
people were very generous, very loving – they offered coffee. They drank
the coffee and soon they were discussing things. And both the couples,
from the earth and from the new planet, were interested in how children
were created in their worlds.</p><p><br></p><p>The man and woman felt a little embarrassed. They said, “First you
show how you create children.” They said, “It is very simple.”</p><p>They opened their refrigerator...</p><p><br></p><p>The couple from the earth was amazed: “What are they doing? What has
a refrigerator got to do with creating children?”</p><p><br></p><p>... and they brought two bottles, one with some green liquid, one
with some red liquid, and a big jar. And they mixed the liquid from both
the bottles in the big jar.</p><p><br></p><p>The couple from the earth was laughing: “What are you doing? Have you
gone mad?”</p><p><br></p><p>They said, “This is the way we make children. Now this jar will
remain in the refrigerator for nine months, and after nine months you
have a baby – you take it out of the jar.”</p><p><br></p><p>The earth couple said, “My God! This is the way we make instant
coffee. What a strange method you have got.”</p><p><br></p><p>They said, “It may look strange to you, but this is how it has always
been done here on this planet. Now you show how you do it.”</p><p><br></p><p>They had to show, because they had promised. They were feeling a
little embarrassed, but not afraid, because nobody from the earth was
present and these people... idiots, mixing liquids from jars and waiting
for nine months<span class=s4></span>They could not believe that there
was going to be a baby. They</p><p>dropped their clothes and started making love.</p><p><br></p><p>And both the people from the new planet were rolling on the ground
with laughter. They could not believe it: “What are you doing?”</p><p><br></p><p>The man was doing push-ups on top of the woman!</p><p><br></p><p>They said, “You idiots! This is the way we make coffee! This is not
the way to produce children!”</p><p>It does not matter – anything would have been questionable. And I
think the way things are, it is perfectly good. In fact, to make coffee
in this way would be a little dangerous. And hearing that this was the
way they made coffee, they both felt so bad because they had already
drunk the coffee!</p><p><br></p><p>Existence is dialectical.</p><p><br></p><p>There has never been one, and there will never be one. It knows a
certain kind of oneness, but that is the organic unity of the two.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, a man like Gautam Buddha knows oneness, but that too is
dialectical. His inner woman and his inner man have come together to
meet in a deep, orgasmic unity. From the outside you see him alone – he
is not. In existence nothing can exist alone. To exist you need the
support of the opposite, either from the outside or from the inside. If
you can find the support from inside then certainly you have immense
freedom, you are no longer dependent on the other.</p><p><br></p><p>With the inner unity you cannot produce children, but you can go on
reproducing yourself; you can go on giving a new birth to yourself. Each
moment becomes a new birth and you go on higher and higher in peace, in
silence, in bliss, in ecstasy... and it has no limits.</p><p><br></p><p>The sky may have limits, but the growth of the spiritual organic
unity within you has no limits. But remember, it is an organic unity
between two polar opposites.</p><p><br></p><p>Every man is a woman also, and every woman is a man also. So you can
manage an inner unity – and that is real celibacy. The celibacy that is
being taught by the religions – I condemn it because that is not
celibacy... renouncing the woman, hating, getting away from the
woman.…</p><p><br></p><p>Perhaps in hating the woman or the man you may start hating all that
is feminine, or all that is male inside you too. You may never be able
to accept your inner woman. If you could not accept the outer how can
you accept the inner? You will try to kill it in every possible way. But
by killing it you will be committing suicide. It will not be spiritual
growth, it will simply be spiritual suicide.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what I see in your saints. Look into their eyes and you will
not find life. Look into their life and you will not find joy. Look into
their being and you will not find a dance, a song. All is dead. Their
body has become just a grave and they are somehow dragging it towards
the graveyard. Their only juice upon which they live is your respect for
them. That gives them enough ego – your respectability, your calling
them great saints, mahatmas... That is the only thing they have got –
which is absolutely bogus, but you go on giving that, not knowing that
you are helping them to commit suicide, that you are also part in their
crime, that you are committing a tremendous sin.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole idea should be dropped. There cannot be any beginning. How
can there be a beginning? From where will all these things come? And if
you can get all these things from somewhere, then this is not a
beginning. Places exist from where you are getting all these things;
contractors exist who are making all these things; suppliers exist who
are ready to supply all that you want...</p><p><br></p><p>Out of nothing, do you think there can be a beginning? And there
cannot be an end, because where will all this disappear to?</p><p>Scientists say you cannot destroy even a single small piece of stone
– there is no way to destroy it. You can cut it into smaller pieces, but
still it is there. You can do whatsoever you want, but it will remain in
some form or other. You cannot simply destroy it so that it leaves no
mark behind. This is one of the basic discoveries of modern science –
that nothing is destructible. If nothing is destructible, then the other
end should also be understood: it is not possible to create anything. If
you cannot destroy anything, you cannot create either.</p><p><br></p><p>We have not been successful in creating anything. Whatever we do is
only combinations. You can create water by the combination of oxygen and
hydrogen, but they are still there. It is not a creation, it is only a
composition.</p><p><br></p><p>You take something from one place, something from another place, and
you can make a new thing – but it is not new. Neither has there ever
been a creation, nor is there going to be a destruction. There is no god
who created, there is no ultimate being who managed to run the world in
a dialectical way.</p><p><br></p><p>Existence is autonomous and it is eternal. But the problem with
theologians, with philosophers, is that they simply invent a name and
they forget that their beginning is only invention, imagination. Then
they go on questioning and then they go on answering, making a big
system.</p><p><br></p><p>I have looked into all the systems of philosophy, I have wasted
almost my whole life in looking into all the systems of the world, and
only one thing that is similar to all of them is that they don’t have
any base. Their basis is simply assumption.</p><p><br></p><p>If you accept their assumption then their whole system looks very
logical, very profound. They are all afraid that you should ask anything
about their basis, because they don’t have any answer. And the basis is
the first thing to ask about. The differences in their systems are not
much, because their bases are all false; the differences are only of
names. Somebody calls it absolute, somebody calls it ultimate, somebody
calls it god, somebody calls it some other name. All these names are
imaginary, and by changing names nothing is changed.</p><p><br></p><p>Just look – as I was telling you, the Bible says, “In the beginning
was the word...” The second sentence contradicts the first: “With the
word was God...”</p><p><br></p><p>And no Christian has the guts to question that in the second
sentence, the first is denied. “In the beginning was the word...” The
second sentence is, “With the word, there was God...” So the word was
not alone. And in the third sentence it is said that God was the
word.</p><p><br></p><p>Can’t you see the contradiction? – so apparent. Then why don’t you
simply say, “In the beginning there was God”? Why say, “the word”? “The
word was with God...” And finally, you come to the real thing: “The word
was God.” Why go this long way? Those first two sentences are
meaningless. You should have said, “In the beginning was God.”</p><p><br></p><p>But to protect God, so that God is not questioned... People will
question the word and will get puzzled with the word, so they have
created a great philosophy about the word and what it means for the word
to be there. They have made a protection for poor God. But anybody who
has eyes cannot be deceived.</p><p><br></p><p>I am reminded.…</p><p>It happened in Bombay that a Hindu saint who used to come there
always had a big following. He was delivering his morning talk, and a
very rich lady was sitting in front of him with her small child who
suddenly said, “Mummy, I want to go to the bathroom.”</p><p><br></p><p>Everybody laughed because the talk was about Vedanta the ultimate
god, and suddenly that boy brings the bathroom in.</p><p><br></p><p>The mother tried to push him, “Sit down.” He said, “I cannot! I want
to piss.”</p><p>Everybody was laughing, and the saint felt very embarrassed. But the
woman was very rich so he could not say anything to her. And he was a
guest in the same woman’s house, he had been there for many years. But
after the meeting he called the woman separately and told her, “You
should teach your child some etiquette. In a spiritual meeting he talked
about the bathroom and pissing, and that created such a disturbance that
all my seriousness was lost and people must have forgotten all the great
things that I was saying. That boy is a real devil. Either you should
not bring him with you or you should teach him something.”</p><p><br></p><p>The woman said, “He insists on coming. And he is my only child and I
cannot leave him crying and weeping at home. I will not be able to sit
listening to you peacefully because I will remember that he will be
weeping and crying.”</p><p><br></p><p>Then the saint said, “I suggest a simple thing to you. You just tell
him that if you want to go to the bathroom you need not say that you
want to piss, you can simply teach him to change the word ‘piss’.
Instead of saying ‘pissing’, say ‘singing’: ‘Mom, I want to sing.’
Nobody will know what is going on; it will be a code language. And this
is not difficult. Make it clear: ‘If you learn this, only then will I
take you with me; otherwise no.’”</p><p><br></p><p>The boy agreed. He said, “There is no problem for me. Whenever I
feel, I will say that I want to sing. You have to understand, don’t
forget!”</p><p><br></p><p>After one year the saint came back. He was staying in the same lady’s
house and just in the evening the lady said, “I am in a trouble. One of
my sisters is seriously sick and I have to go to see her. I may not be
able to come back in the night. The child is alone. It will be great
kindness if you let him sleep with you in the bed because he has never
slept alone.”</p><p><br></p><p>The saint said, “There is no problem.” The woman left.</p><p>In the middle of the night the child shook the saint and said, “I
want to sing.”</p><p><br></p><p>The saint said, “Are you mad? Is this the time for singing? In the
middle of the night, disturbing all the neighbors...? Shut up and go to
sleep.”</p><p><br></p><p>The boy remained silent for a few minutes. He said, “It is difficult
to shut up. You have to allow me to sing – it is coming.”</p><p>The saint said, “What nonsense. The whole day I have been teaching
people and in the night you won’t let me sleep, and your mother has left
you in my care. I tell you, go to sleep. If you want to sing, sing in
the morning!”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I can’t wait that long. You don’t understand. I have to
sing NOW.”</p><p><br></p><p>So the saint said, “It seems you won’t listen, so okay, sing but sing
very quietly. Just come close to my ear; sing in a whisper... nobody
hears.”</p><p><br></p><p>The boy said, “I warn you.” He said, “Don’t tell me later on. It
seems you don’t know what singing means.”</p><p><br></p><p>The saint said, “You think you know more than me? You just sing
whatsoever you want to. Be finished and go to bed!”</p><p><br></p><p>Half asleep, the saint suddenly jumped when the boy started “singing”
in his ear.… He said, “My God! This you call singing!”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “It is your teaching... you told my mother.… Otherwise I was
always telling the truth. You made me a hypocrite, now suffer.”</p><p><br></p><p>And the saint said, “This is something. Could you not tell me what
singing means?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “That was the whole point – to hide the thing that it means.
I thought that you have given the suggestion so you must know.”</p><p><br></p><p>You can change the words but you cannot change reality. You can call
it singing, you can call it dancing, you can call it anything, but if it
is pissing, it is pissing.</p><p><br></p><p>My approach is absolutely scientific and existential. I don’t have
any assumptions. I cannot tell you that existence ever began, because I
am not a witness to it. And I cannot conceive of anybody being a witness
to it; it will be a contradiction. And if there has been no beginning,
there cannot be any end. Things end only if they have a beginning.</p><p><br></p><p>And I don’t see that there is anything wrong in the reproductive
system; it is perfectly good except for your so-called religious people
who have been condemning sex. Sex has nothing to be condemned. It is
sacred because it gives birth to life. It has given birth to you. It has
given birth to Gautam Buddha... it has given birth to all that we are
proud of.</p><p><br></p><p>You go on condemning the very origin. You want some changes, but what
changes? any change will be questionable. So I don’t see any point in
questioning.</p><p><br></p><p>I accept nature as it is.</p><p><br></p><p>And I accept it with gratitude, thankfulness. It is the most
beautiful existence possible.</p><p>Question 2 BELOVED MASTER,</p><p>AS ONE GROWS OLD, ONE’S IDEAS SLOWLY CHANGE. ARE YOUR IDEAS ABOUT SEX
TO SUPERCONSCIOUSNESS THE SAME? YOUR COMMENT PLEASE.</p><p><br></p><p>Perhaps you are not aware that there are two kinds of growth. Most
people grow old; a few people simply grow up. I belong to the second
category. I don’t grow old, I simply grow up.</p><p><br></p><p>The body will grow old, but the body has nothing to do with my ideas.
My consciousness grows up.</p><p><br></p><p>I have more profound ideas about sex and superconsciousness than I
had before. There has been evolution about everything in me, but
whatever I have said before has deepened, has become more solid. Now I
have more arguments for it – that’s what growing up means. Nothing has
changed, only everything has become more clear, more solid, more
conclusive.</p><p><br></p><p>I have been thinking to speak – because I have never read my books –
on each book again, so that you can see that I have not contradicted a
single thing in those books. Although I have gone far away from those
ideas, it is in favor of those books, not against them.</p><p><br></p><p>Whatever I have said after my enlightenment is unchangeable. It can
evolve, it can grow, it can bring more flowers to it, it can have deeper
roots in the ground, but its quality, its taste will remain the
same.</p><p><br></p><p>And I hope that my sannyasins will learn to grow up, not just to grow
old. Even animals grow old – buffaloes, donkeys – everybody grows old.
It is only man’s prerogative, his privilege, to grow up.</p><p><br></p><p>The body will take its own course, but your consciousness can go on
growing up, can go on growing even when you are dying, can go on growing
when you are dead, can go on growing wherever you are. That growth is
eternal.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 3 BELOVED MASTER,</p><p>SEERS HAVE SAID – GURU RAMA, GURU VISHNU, GURU DEVA MAHESHWAR – THAT
THE MASTER IS THE GENERATOR, THE OPERATOR AND THE DESTROYER.</p><p><br></p><p>I CANNOT CONCEIVE HOW IT CAN BE TRUE. PLEASE ENLIGHTEN ME.</p><p><br></p><p>The Hindu mythology has something equal to the Christian trinity. It
is called the trimurti, the three faces of god – Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh.
These are not three persons, but only three faces of one person.</p><p><br></p><p>Brahma creates the world; Vishnu maintains it, sustains it, nourishes
it; and Shiva destroys it. This is one cycle.</p><p>Then another cycle begins: Brahma creates again, and so on, so forth.
It is just a mythology, but mythologies have been so heavy on man’s mind
that sometimes it is hilarious to see.</p><p><br></p><p>Brahma is the creator of the world, but in India there is only one
temple devoted to Brahma. Because who cares about Brahma? He has done
his work, he is useless. He may be a god, a great god. He created the
whole world, but he has no longer any worshippers. Just a single temple
is devoted to him. You can see the mind of the people.</p><p><br></p><p>I will not talk about the theology but its implication. Most of the
temples are of Vishnu, or his incarnations – Krishna, Ram – these are
all incarnations of Vishnu. Most of the temples are of Vishnu because he
has the power, and power has to be worshipped. Right now he is
everything, he can do everything, he can change everything – he is all
powerful.</p><p><br></p><p>Shiva also has millions of statues, but not many temples. That too is
very significant. Vishnu’s temples are immensely rich, with great art,
sculpture, beauty. Shiva is the poorest god. You can find any axe-shaped
marble stone, put it under any tree and it becomes a temple of
Shiva.</p><p><br></p><p>Who cares about death, destruction? But people are afraid. So once in
a while, placing a few flowers is perfectly understandable. But no great
temples have been raised for Shiva. He lives under trees in the hot sun,
in the rain, in the cold. People worship him just out of fear.</p><p><br></p><p>Fear can never become worship; neither can business ever become
worship. Vishnu is people’s business; Shiva is the god of death, god of
destruction. He has to be kept friendly – he is dangerous.</p><p><br></p><p>Another example you will find – you can look in the books of all the
businessmen in India. I don’t know, it must be the same in Nepal – every
businessman starts his books with Shri Ganeshaya Namah – Ganesh is
Shiva’s son. Why is it that every book all over India, and wherever
Hinduism has had any influence, starts with Shri Ganeshaya Namah – I bow
down to Shri Ganesh, the great god? All other gods are forgotten. The
reason is that in the beginning Ganesh was a very mischievous fellow –
he used to harm, to disturb. Just to keep him calm and cool – “Please
don’t disturb our business” – people started praising him: Shri
Ganeshaya Namah. It was not out of respect, it was a bribery because he
was a great destroyer. He was the son of the ultimate god of destruction
and he used to play mischief all around. He would disturb people’s
marriages, people’s businesses, so everything that has to be started has
first to remember Ganesh.</p><p><br></p><p>This is not religion. This is simply persuading Ganesh: “Don’t
disturb us – we are on your side. We are not your enemies, we are
worshippers...” Mythologies which have no reality in them – you can see
Ganesh and you can understand that this cannot be a reality. Ganesh has
the body of a man and the head of an elephant. This is not possible. And
above all this nonsense, having the head of an elephant, a big belly
because he loves laddus – and he is sitting on a mouse! That is his
vehicle. Can you conceive it? Is it possible? That poor mouse carrying
the whole load of a full wagon would have died long ago.</p><p><br></p><p>But people never ask, never question their own mythologies. The same
is true about Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh – just creations of the human
mind. The world has never been created so there is no need of any
Brahma. And it is not going to be destroyed, so there is no need of any
Shiva. And between the two is Vishnu.</p><p>The world is autonomous, it does not need anybody to maintain it. But
all over the world people have strange kinds of mythologies dominating
their minds. And they have devoted millions of hours, money, artists, to
make temples for these imaginations. And then to look at people
worshipping their own imaginary gods is so ridiculous.</p><p><br></p><p>My father used to take me to a temple which was very close. It was a
very beautiful Jaina temple with a standing statue of Mahavira, an
ancient statue. I loved the peace of the temple. I loved the statue, its
art, but I never felt like worshipping. A statue has to be appreciated
as a beautiful object of art, there is no question of worship. You don’t
worship the painting of Picasso.</p><p><br></p><p>And my father would say to me, “You have to worship Mahavira because
he is equivalent in Jainism to the supreme god. He has the same
qualities. He is omnipotent, omnipresent, omniscient – he can see
everything: past, present, future. He is everywhere present and he is
all powerful.”</p><p><br></p><p>I told him, “To tell you the truth, I have seen a mouse sitting on
his head pissing, and your great saint Mahavira could not do anything.
Perhaps he could not see above his head. All powerful? Everywhere
present? And he could not even throw the mouse away? I have seen it with
my own eyes, and if you want to see it I can bring a white mouse which
my friend has, and I can manage the whole scene again. I can bring
another friend who is a photographer and we will distribute the
photograph all over the town: ‘This is your omnipresent, omnipotent,
omniscient god – now stop worshipping!’ He has lost power over rats,
what can he do for you?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Don’t do any such thing. If you don’t want to worship, keep
quiet.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “You have to keep quiet. This was just an instance for you so
you don’t continue harassing me that I have to worship.”</p><p><br></p><p>This is man’s creation – beautiful. It should be kept in a museum,
but it is not to be worshipped. For worshipping you have the whole
universe which is not man’s creation – the stars in the night, the
sunrise in the morning, the sunset in the evening, a bird on the wing...
But I have never seen any religious person worshipping all that is not
man-made and has such tremendous beauty, so much alive. And we are part
of it, and you go on worshipping a stone that you yourself have named.
That much for the mythology part.</p><p><br></p><p>But your question is that the seers have said that the master is all
– he is Brahma the creator, he is Vishnu the maintainer, he is Shiva the
destroyer. This is the ugliest thing that anybody can write. And these
seers are writing about themselves that they are the masters. You
worship them because they are all three in one. They are Brahma, they
are Vishnu, they are Mahesh.</p><p><br></p><p>Where are you going to worship in the temples when the master is
present?</p><p><br></p><p>This is the ugliest part in it. If some disciple had written it, it
would have been understandable – his gratitude. But the gurus, the
so-called masters are writing these lines and they have been perpetuated
for centuries. Nobody has even questioned that this self-appraisal is
simply ugly, disgusting.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard that one day Mulla Nasruddin came into the restaurant
and declared, “My wife is the most beautiful woman in the world.”</p><p>Everybody was shocked, everybody knew his wife... he himself knew
it.</p><p><br></p><p>People gathered around him and said, “Mulla, have you had a
revelation? Who told you? Has she been chosen Miss Universe? What has
happened that you have to declare?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “She has not been chosen, she has told me herself. I am a
faithful servant. Whatever she says I believe it. She said that she is
the most beautiful woman, and I said, perfectly right; I will go and
tell my friends.”</p><p><br></p><p>The seers themselves are saying to you that they are better than
Brahma, better than Vishnu, better than Mahesh, because those gods have
only one quality each and they have all the three qualities
together.</p><p><br></p><p>It is possible for a disciple who loves the master to call him God,
because he has seen something of godliness for the first time in his
life. But if the master himself declares that he is the god then it is
ridiculous. Then it is not worth consideration at all.</p><p><br></p><p>Those seers are simply being stupid. This kind of statement makes one
think that they must have been idiotic. This is so egoistic – you cannot
find any other statement which is more egoistic. These are the people
who are teaching everybody to drop the ego, and they are the biggest
egoists in the world.</p><p><br></p><p>I would like to say to you that any master who claims that you have
to worship him is no longer considered to be a master. A real master can
only be a friend, not a god.</p><p><br></p><p>It is possible for the disciple to feel the godliness of the master –
that is another matter. Question 4</p><p>BELOVED MASTER,</p><p><br></p><p>WHAT OF JAINA AND SUFI RELIGIONS – IS THERE ANY GENUINE MASTER IN THE
PRESENT MOMENT ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD?</p><p><br></p><p>PLEASE GIVE SOME LIGHT ON THIS MATTER.</p><p><br></p><p>Can’t you see the light?</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part22>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

SLOWLY, SOMETHING INSIDE IS OPENING UP TOWARDS FRIENDSHIP WITH YOU. DO I HAVE TO PASS THROUGH DEVOTION TO BECOME YOUR FRIEND? I SHALL REMAIN RESPECTFUL AND PASS BOTH OF THEM TOGETHER.\nThey only can exist together. The friendship with a master is no ordinary friendship. It has a reverence in it, love in it, devotion in it, tremendous gratitude in it. It is a multidimensional phenomenon.\nThe ordinary friendship is a worldly thing, mundane. The spiritual friendship is not of this world, it belongs to the beyond. I have to use the same words which are used for the mundane because there are no other words, so you have to be alert and aware that whatever I say, you cannot find its meaning in a dictionary. It has much more in it. It is immensely rich.\nThe word is small and very soft and the experience is vast and very infinite. And I can see in you it is not just an intellectual question, your heart is feeling immense pain because you are thinking that friendship means you have to bypass devotion, respect, reverence, and your heart is saying no.\nListen to the heart, not to the dictionary.\nThe heart never lies; the mind never tells the truth. The mind is a great speaker; the heart is very silent but it also expresses itself in tears.\nYour question is immensely significant because it is coming from the heart. The heart is feeling the pain because the mind has taken the word ‘friendship’ in an ordinary sense, ignoring the heart. The heart is full of tears. Those tears are valuable.\nThe understanding of the mind has no significance. In the world of spirituality it is only the heart that has to be listened to and followed. Your heart is giving you the answer. I am simply repeating it so that it becomes clear to you.\nThe friendship with the master includes everything that is beautiful in all other relationships, and it excludes everything that is ugly in all our human relationships. It is the pure essence, the very fragrance of all our human relationships. It includes everything, but only the best part of it, the very cream of it.\nSo don’t be worried, rejoice that it is happening to you and that your heart is strong enough not to let the mind decide. Your heart is strong enough to be the master and let the mind be simply a servant.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED MASTER,\nWHEN THE MASTER IS STANDING AT THE DOOR WHAT SHOULD THE DISCIPLE DO?\nThe question is from somebody very intellectual – perhaps a professor. It is a mind question.\nWhen the master is at the door it is too late! You cannot do anything. You cannot close the door in the face of the master, you cannot invite the master inside for the simple reason the ancient scriptures of the East say the master is death – and they mean it.\nTo allow the master in means you will have to die as an ego, as a personality, and that’s all you know about yourself. Hence the fear, hence the question, what to do now? He is just at the door. One step more and you are finished. But there is no need to be worried.\nYou will die as an ego but you will be reborn as the self, which is your reality. You will die as a personality but you will be born as an individuality, which is existential. Personality is just artificial.\nThe master can take away only those things which do not belong to you. He cannot take anything away from you which is your authentic nature. The master cannot give you anything, he simply removes all the hindrances so that you can discover yourself.\nI am reminded of one historical incident.…\nThe world’s best sculptor, Michelangelo, was passing through the street where there were many shops of marble and different kinds of stone sellers. He used to go there often to find good pieces of marble. In front of the first shop, on the other side of the road, there was a huge piece of marble,\nvery ugly looking, and it had been lying there for almost five years. He had never paid any attention to it. He went around the marble, looked at it, touched it, and was immensely happy. He came back to the owner of the shop and asked, “What will you take for that stone?”\nThe shop owner said, “Nothing, you can take it, because I have kept it for five years – and nobody wants it. And I am paying unnecessary rent for it. I cannot keep it in the shop, it is too big. So I am keeping it on the other side of the road on somebody else’s land, and he is charging me rent for it. You are the first man in five years who has even inquired about it. Thousands of sculptors have been coming to the shop, but none has even paid attention to the stone. You can take it joyfully, with my thanks. You need not pay for it because I am getting fed up with it.”\nMichelangelo arranged for the stone to be carried to his home, and he said to the shopkeeper, “When I have worked it out I would love and appreciate very much if you can come to see what has become of the stone, because I have already seen it. It is only a question of chipping the stone here and there. Somebody is encaged in the stone who has called me, I have not to do much, I have not to create anything – just to remove the unnecessary parts.”\nAnd he created the most beautiful statue perhaps in the whole world – a statue of Mary, Jesus’ mother, when she takes Jesus down from the cross. Mary is sitting, and Jesus is lying in her lap dead... full-size; the stone was so big. He worked for one year on it, and when it was completed he asked the owner to come and see. The owner could not believe that that ugly stone could be transformed into such a beautiful statue as he had ever seen.\nBut Michelangelo said, “It was Mary and Jesus who called me. I was coming into your shop and they called me, saying, ‘We are encaged in this stone – just give us freedom.’”\nThat’s how every artist works. Before he starts making a statue he has already seen it in his vision. Then he has just to remove the unnecessary parts. The master is the greatest artist in the world. He does not work with stones or marble, he works with living human beings. When he accepts somebody to be a friend, it means he has seen the vision, the possibility, the potentiality – what you can become.\nYou have chosen the master; you have invited him. Now he is at the door, and you are freaking out. Your mind must be worried.\nThe master is certainly dangerous. If he is not dangerous he is not a master at all. He is going to destroy much in you – only then the real can be discovered. And you are asking me, what can be done when the master is at the door.\nYou can do only one thing, being a professor, intellectual... I remember a story in Mulla Nasruddin’s life.…\nHe used to visit the cafe every evening, and he always talked and bragged about everything. That day he was bragging about his generosity, hospitality, and a friend said, “Mulla, you can talk about other things, but at least don’t talk about these things because we have been your friends for years. You have never asked us even for a cup of tea. Every day we have to pay for your coffee and anything that you eat in the cafe. You have some nerve.”\nHe said, “You never remind me. Make me remember it. I am a man of great spirituality and I don’t think about small, mundane things – a cup of coffee or money, these things don’t matter. You should have reminded me. Today you have reminded me. You all are invited to my house. Come for dinner. The whole cafe... friends, acquaintances, strangers.… It doesn’t matter, everybody has to come; then you will know how generous I am.”\nThey could not believe it, but he was inviting, so they followed him, a great crowd. And as the house came nearer, Mulla started walking slower. They said, “What is the matter, Mulla?”\nMulla said, “You all know. You are all married. I am also married, so there is nothing to be kept secret. I forgot all about my wife. Talking about great things I forgot about my wife. In fact, in the morning she had sent me to purchase vegetables and it is night now and I have wasted the whole day talking about spirituality and great things. And finally I ended up with you, and now I am coming with a crowd for dinner and there is nothing in the house. You can understand my situation. She will kill me.”\nThey said, “This is strange. You should have remembered. How should we know it? But now we are not going back.”\nMulla said, “I am not telling you to go back. You just remain standing at the door. Let me go in and persuade my wife; it will take a few minutes. I am sorry, but you will have to wait, because if I enter with this whole crowd, she will go mad.”\nThey understood; they had the same problems. They said, “Okay, we will wait for a few minutes. You go and persuade your wife.”\nMulla went in and told her, “A gang of stupid people is following me. Now only you can save me.” The wife said, “What is the matter?”\nHe said, “Nothing is the matter. You simply go there and ask them, ‘Why are you standing here?’ And they will certainly say, ‘We are waiting here for Mulla Nasruddin.’ And you can say, ‘He has not been seen since the morning. He had gone to purchase vegetables and I have been waiting the whole day.’”\nThe woman said, “Strange... why so many people should come and...” Mulla said, “But you have to save me. It is a question of prestige.”\nThe wife went out, opened the door, and said to the people, “What are you doing here?”\nThey said, “We are not doing anything. We are simply staying here because Mulla told us to stay here.”\nThe wife said, “He has not been seen since the morning.”\nThey said, “This is something. He came with us, we all are eyewitnesses – in front of us he entered into the room.”\nThe wife said, “You must be mistaken, he is not in the house.”\nThey said, “Then we would like to look in the house because he has invited us for dinner.” The wife said, “Dinner?”\nAt that point – Mulla was listening to the whole conversation from the second story; he had opened the window a little bit and was watching what was happening. When they said that they were going to search the house he thought, “This is going to be difficult.”\nHe shouted from the window, “You are simply idiots. He may have come with you but you don’t understand logic, he may have gone from the back door. Are you not ashamed arguing with a poor woman? Feel ashamed and go back home!”\nNow he forgot that you cannot deny yourself – that is impossible. You cannot say, I may have gone from the back door. Then who is talking? But in the fury, in the anger, and they were trying to force themselves into the house, and the poor wife would not be able to prevent them and he was bound to be caught...!\nYou are in the same situation. You can tell the master that you are not at home. That’s what millions of people are saying, that they are not at home. So it is not just a joke, it is a reality for millions of people. All the people who deny the existence of the soul are saying, “I am not at home.” Then who is denying?\nHalf the world is communist today. They don’t believe in the soul; they argue about it. I have been arguing with many communists, and I was surprised that they are not aware of a simple thing: who is arguing?\nYou are conscious, and you are denying consciousness. You are alive, and you are denying the very principle of life. You are in a really difficult situation, you cannot escape now. That’s why I said it is too late. It is better to invite the master in, because he won’t care about your invitation, he is going to enter in.\nHe is your master. You have accepted him as your master, and unconsciously you may have invited him many times to come to you, and now he has come. Now there is no way to escape. It is better to accept the fact that he is going to kill you as you have known you up to now, and he is going to give you a new birth.\nSocrates used to say that the basic function of the master is just to give birth, but every birth has to be preceded by death. Once you understand it, once you have passed through such an experience of death and birth, then you will live each moment of your life dying to the past and being reborn anew in the present. Then each moment is a death and a rebirth, and that is the only real life. Then you don’t carry dead weight of so many years, of so many lives – an unnecessary burden which does not allow you to live lightly, lovingly, dancingly.\nIf the master has come to the gate you are fortunate – let him come in just for once, because next time he will not come. Next time you will be doing the same yourself. You will know the key.\nThat death, every death, opens doors for new and fresh life. If you want to be alive intensely, you have to allow death to happen every moment and then you will know a totally new taste of vitality, of youth, of energy, of freshness. And with your freshness, the whole existence becomes fresh. With your youth, the whole existence becomes young.\nI have heard about one chief justice of the Supreme Court of America. When he retired he told his wife... and they had remained together for almost sixty years. They had had their honeymoon in Paris. He said, “Before I die I have a great desire to go back to Paris to the same hotel, to the same room, to visit the same places that we visited when we had our honeymoon.”\nThe wife was also excited. They both went to Paris – the hotel was the same, the room was the same, the places they went to see were the same. But the old man said, “Something seems to be very dull, old. It is no longer the same Paris. I don’t see the same joy and the same dance and the same beauty.”\nHis wife was more pragmatic – wives are always more pragmatic, more earthbound. She took the hand of the old man and told him, “You are wrong. Paris is exactly the same, perhaps more beautiful. In sixty years it has become bigger, more beautiful, better. But you have forgotten one thing: this is not our honeymoon, and we have become sixty years older. It is our old eyes which are so full of dust and death that we cannot see the youth and the freshness and the beauty. Don’t say Paris is no longer Paris, simply say that we are no longer the same.”\nShe was saying a great truth: the world is what you are. If you are frustrated, sad, miserable, you will see the same things all around. And if you are joyous, your heart is full of song, you will see the whole world with songs and dances and flowers and fragrance. It all depends on you.\nSo don’t be worried. It is a blessing that the master is at the door. It happens only to the fortunate ones.\nQuestion 3 BELOVED MASTER,\nMA VEENA HAS DECEASED, AND WAS JUST BORN AGAIN WITH THE NEW NAME, MA PREM VIDEH. SHE HAS ENTERED INTO A NEW WORLD FEELING QUITE DIFFERENT.\nBUT I AM A LITTLE CONFUSED. PLEASE WOULD YOU LIKE TO TELL ME ABOUT IT?\nIt is not only the experience of Veena who has died in becoming a sannyasin, and is born as Videh. This is the experience of millions of sannyasins around the world.…\nInitiation is death and life.\nInitiation is a discontinuity with the past.\nYou had lived a life, you had experienced many things, but all your experiences and your whole life were not a fulfillment. It was not a contentment, it was not ecstatic; it was more misery, more\nsuffering, more pain. It was more dragging than living. That is the reason one starts looking for a new way of life, a new mode of existence.\nSannyas is a revolution.\nIt simply means that you are finished with the past, and you don’t want to repeat it. You have repeated it enough, and the repetition has made you almost a robot. It does not give joy. Every morning it is the same, every evening it is the same – tomorrow will be simply another carbon copy of today.\nHow can you feel like rejoicing? Every day is bringing you nearer to the end. Death will come and erase you just the way people go and write their names on the beach, their signatures, and a wave comes and erases it all.\nDeath comes and erases you completely as if you had never been here. Do you know how many people have been here? Each person is sitting on the corpses of at least ten persons. Every inch of the earth has been a graveyard.\nI am reminded of a very famous Sufi story.…\nOne king was unable to sleep in the night. He was tossing and turning when he heard somebody on the roof of the palace, walking. He shouted, “Who is there?”\nThe man said, “It is none of your business. I am searching for my camel.”\nThe king said, “You seem to be an utter idiot. Camels don’t get lost on people’s roofs.”\nBut the man said, “It is true I am an idiot, but no more than you, because what you are searching for in this palace your father was also searching for, your grandfather was also searching for. For generations you have been searching in this palace and you have not found anything. You are wasting your time, and your death is not far away. It is possible that a camel may get lost on a roof, but it is impossible to find contentment, blissfulness the way you are searching for them and in the place where you are searching for them.”\nAnd his voice was so authoritative. The king had never in his life come across another man... he had only dealt with servants, soldiers, his own people, and they were always saying “Yes, sir.” And this man shouted from the roof.\nThe king called his guards. A great search was made but the man could not be caught.\nThe next morning the king was sitting in the court thinking about the man. Slowly, slowly he had calmed down and was thinking that perhaps he was right. “It was not the right way to tell me such a thing – in the middle of the night on my own roof – but what he said seemed to be significant. And the man cannot be mad!”\nAt that very moment another man at the door started arguing with the guard, “I want to stay in this caravanserai for a few days.”\nThe guard said, “You must be mad. This is the king’s own palace, his own home. There is a caravanserai, you can go half a mile more and you will find it.”\nHe said, “I want to stay in this caravanserai!”\nThe guard said, “But you seem to be absolutely stupid. You don’t understand a simple thing, that this is a palace.”\nThe king was listening from inside; the voice was the same. He told the guards, “Bring that man in. I have been looking for him.”\nHe looked at the man; he said, “Are you not the same man who was looking for the camel on my roof?”\nHe said, “So you have come down to your senses. Yes, I am the man. And I had to do this just to make you aware that neither can camels be found on the roofs of houses nor can bliss be found in a caravanserai which you are mistakenly believing is your own house.\n“I came here before and there was another man – you were not here – and he was claiming the same thing, that it was his house. I came before that, and there was another man, and he was also claiming that this was his house. Now you are claiming it. I can say with guarantee, that the fourth time I come I will find somebody else claiming the same.”\nThe king said, “You are right. One was my father, the other was my grandfather, the other was my great-grandfather. And it is possible that next time you come perhaps you may find my son in my place – I am getting old. But to what conclusion are you trying to lead me?”\nThe man laughed. He said, “You have understood the conclusion – that it is a caravanserai, and many people have lived here and gone. It is nobody’s home. In this whole earth there is no home, only caravanserais. Why not accept a fact?”\nThe impact of the man, his personality, was so much that the king immediately left the home and he said, “He is right. His methods are a little mad, but I have heard about many Sufis who use methods which look mad but their madness is only a device. I have understood. I am leaving this caravanserai in search of my home.”\nThis man became a very famous Sufi himself. He went outside the capital, made a small hut there at the crossroads, and lived there. And every day there was trouble, because anybody who would come to the crossroads would ask, “Which road leads to the city?”\nAnd he would say, “Go right and you will reach the eternal city.” For a moment they would think, “eternal city...?”\nBut one forgives mystics! These people talk strange things.… “But this is the road...?” They would say, “You are certain?”\nHe would say, “I am absolutely certain. You can go and find it yourself” – and that was the road leading to the graveyard.\nAnd those people would come back furious, and would tell him, “You seem to be really mad. There is no city, there is a graveyard.”\nBut the king would say, “I told you beforehand it is the eternal city. Once a person starts residing there, he resides forever. It is the real city, you should have asked about the unreal city. The road on the left goes to the unreal city – where people live for a few days thinking that this is the city and finally have to leave and go to the eternal city. And I am always in trouble. People ask for the real city and I show them the real city, then they come with anger. You can go to the unreal city this way, but remember, that is an unreal city. Don’t take it for granted that it is real. I also used to live there. I want to find the real home before death finds me.”\nOne becomes a sannyasin to find the real home, to find something of eternity, to find something which death cannot destroy. Certainly, it cannot be the body – it is a caravanserai. It cannot be the mind – it changes constantly.\nInitiation into sannyas is the beginning of the search for something beyond mind. And one who takes initiation with a deep love, a great adventure, understanding that whatever way he has lived was not right, that it was the dark night of the soul, and he is entering into the world of light... A simple initiation which for the outsiders will mean nothing, but for the person himself it is a mutation – his whole being is changed. His past drops from him and the future opens its doors. Now he starts living for the first time as a conscious human being. And this consciousness goes on growing.\nSo what has happened to the questioner is a reality which has happened to many, many people. And this is the reason we change the name in sannyas – just to give you an indication that now you are no longer the old self. Just a hint to let the old be dead and begin anew, fresh from the very scratch – a new life, a new being, a new love, a new consciousness. Enter into a new universal truth.\nI am happy, Videh, that Veena is dead. Rejoice in the death of Veena, and rejoice in the birth of Videh.\nQuestion 4 BELOVED MASTER,\nI AM HAPPIER AS YOUR SANNYASIN COMPARED TO MY LIFE BEFORE SANNYAS. BUT I DON’T FEEL LIKE MEDITATING OR PRAYING. WITHOUT PRAYING AND MEDITATING THE CHANGES HAPPEN ANYWAY, AND I AM HAPPY AND CONTENTED. THIS SEED OF BEING SAD HAS TO GO.\nSHOULD I FORCE MYSELF TO MEDITATE, OR SHOULD I WAIT AND LET THIS HAPPINESS GROW, OR SHOULD I BE AS I WAS?\nI AM CONFUSED. ONLY YOU CAN GUIDE ME PROPERLY, BECAUSE I DON’T TRUST ANYONE BUT YOU.\nFirst, there is no need to go back and live a sad and miserable life. That suits the stupid and the idiots, not anyone who has a little bit of intelligence. Life is to rejoice, life is to dance.\nLife is to drink the juice of it as totally as possible.\nI am reminded of an incident in paradise, in a restaurant.…\nLao Tzu, Confucius and Gautam Buddha – all three were sitting around a table discussing great things. Just at that moment a naked woman, immensely beautiful, came with a jar to the side of the table and asked them, “Would you like to taste some juice of life?”\nGautam Buddha simply closed his eyes – he did not reply.\nConfucius half closed his eyes – he believes in the golden mean. And he said to the girl, “I would just like to taste, not to drink. I would just like to know how it tastes.” So he had taken just a sip and he said, “It is bitter. You take it away.”\nLao Tzu took the whole jar from the girl’s hands and drank it completely in one gulp. Even the girl was surprised. Emptying the jar, he said, “Great. It was delicious. But to know anything really, one has to go totally into it. It was bitter to you, Confucius, because you are unaware of the new taste of life. You don’t have a trained tongue, trained buds; you have never lived life. You have always been an outsider on the boundaries with your half-closed eyes. Whatever you see is incomplete. Truth can never be seen incomplete – either you see it or you don’t see it. Truth is indivisible.\n“I had to drink the whole of the juice. Please forgive me. Without drinking the whole, it is impossible to give any judgment. You both are incapable of giving any judgment. Gautam Buddha is absolutely out because he knows no taste and he has closed eyes, he has not even seen how it looks. He has not seen the beautiful woman who has brought it. He is making himself blind and dumb; he is closing himself against life. So whatever he says about life is irrelevant.\n“And I will not trust any word from you either. Half-closed eyes can only give you a half truth. In just taking a sip, it may not even have reached into your stomach, you may not have digested it. It has not become blood and bone in you, and unless truth becomes your very being, your very heart, you have no right to say anything about it.\n“I am the only one with fully open eyes who has drunk it totally.”\nI love the story. It certainly is a story, because in paradise there are no restaurants – in hell there are.\nIn paradise what will you do with restaurants? Saints don’t like restaurants. The restaurants would not find any customers. They would have gone bankrupt a long time ago. So it is simply an example, a parable, but very significant.\nSo the first thing is: you are not to go back to sadness and misery, and even though I am saying you are not to go back, I don’t mean that you can – there is no way; you cannot. There is nothing to go back to. You were sad and miserable, now you are contented and happy. Why in the world should you choose to go back?\nAs far as meditation or prayer is concerned, remember, you cannot force them. There are things in life which you cannot do violently, which you have only to wait for silently, inviting, welcoming, with open doors, awake and alert so that when the guest comes you can welcome the guest. And it is already happening to you. You say you have not meditated, still you are finding deep contentment and happiness. If there is contentment it means that without your knowing, some qualities of meditation have entered into you. Without knocking on your door, happiness has made a way into you.\nThe connection between contentment, happiness, misery and sadness is almost like light and darkness. If you suddenly find that darkness has disappeared from your being, whether you know it or not, light has entered. Without the entry of light, the darkness cannot go.\nSo my suggestion is that first be grateful that even though you have not meditated... you have just been listening to me. But in just listening to me something in you has become silent, for a few moments there has been a gap in your thinking. There have been times when you were there but there was no ego. Just sitting here, waiting for what I am going to say – in that gap, contentment has entered.\nIn America, hundreds of television reporters used to come, and their only complaint with me was: “What can be said in ten minutes you take twenty minutes. We have a limited time and we don’t want to cut anything because whatever you are saying is so interconnected that if we cut anything it will be out of context. Why can’t you speak like everybody else? Why do you suddenly become silent? You speak a word and then you leave a gap.”\nI said, “This is the way I am going to speak, because it is a question not only of speaking, it is a question of giving moments of meditation to the people who are listening to me.\n“While I am speaking they are engaged, their minds are filled with me. When suddenly I stop for a moment, their minds also stop, waiting.And those are the most beautiful moments, when they\nhave a taste of meditation without knowing that they are meditating.”\nThat’s what has happened to you. You have been in touch with meditation up to now without awareness. From now on you have to be fully aware. Contentment and happiness indicate – they are symptoms that a change has started happening inside you. No need to force, just go on as you are, enjoying your contentment more, allowing the same situation in which it happens, relishing every bit of happiness that comes to you and watching when it comes, what is the situation in which it comes. So move in that situation more and more. No need to force meditation, no need to force anything. Simply create the right atmosphere in which those things start happening on their own.\nAnd they are already happening. So you have just to see the knack of how they are happening and go on very easily, at ease, without any tension, without any effort, without any enforcement. Because the danger is if you become greedy and if you want them to happen more and you try to force them, you may destroy even that which is happening. So no effort, no will has to be involved in it.\nYou have to be simply waiting. And waiting is prayer.\nWaiting for the unknown to enter in you. Waiting to be pregnant with the divine.\nYou cannot do anything about it, but you can wait.\nAnd the last thing: you said you trust only me. If just by trusting me so much is happening to you, just think if you trust everybody how much more will be happening to you. Trusting a single human being has changed your life from sadness to contentment. If you can trust everybody without conditions, you will see a tremendous revolution happening every moment in your life, raising your consciousness to more and more glory and grandeur and splendor. Why distrust anybody?\nPeople distrust because they are afraid that trust can make them vulnerable, people can cheat them easily. So they close themselves. They lock all the doors, all the windows so nobody can cheat them, nobody can deceive them. But they don’t know that by locking all the doors, all the windows, they are preventing the sun to enter, they are preventing the fresh breeze to blow in, they are preventing the fragrances of the roses to come in. Of course, they have prevented the thieves also from coming in. What can thieves take away from you? You are just sad and miserable. Are you afraid they will take away your sadness and your misery? What have you got that you are worried about?\nIt happened to Mulla Nasruddin.…\nHe used to sleep with all the windows open – according to my advice – all the doors open.And\nnaturally, a thief entered, and he collected everything in the house.\nMulla was sleeping on a blanket. Seeing that the man had collected everything, he threw his blanket also on his pile. The thief was surprised. He said, “I thought you were asleep.”\nMulla said, “I was pretending.”\n“You are a strange man – I am a thief.”\nHe said, “No worry. You can take everything away – I am coming with you. Because what does it matter in which house we live? I will live with you. And I have found a servant. I was looking for a servant, and it is so difficult nowadays to find a servant. You have come on your own. Now where is your house?”\nWhat can people take away? Death is going to take it away at any moment. You have come into the world empty-handed, and you will go from the world empty-handed, so it does not matter. Between these twoWhat you have in your hands does not matter. What matters is that you lost trust, which\nis an immense treasure of your being.\nBy trusting everybody you can lose a few things. They may steal your money, but if you can continue to trust even thosetrust is a great treasure. Trusting people who can cheat you, who are going to\ncheat you, is real trust.\nI am not going to cheat you, I am not going to steal anything from your house. I have already stolen you. I am a different kind of man. When I have stolen you, I have stolen everything. Why bother about each thing separately – I do a wholesale job.\nNow you don’t have anything! You and all that you have belongs to me. So if people take away a few things, let me worry about it, you go on trusting.\nBut trust the whole of humanity. Whatever happens, don’t lose your trust, because trust is so valuable. It is going to give you all that meditation can give, all that prayer can give, and without any effort. And if you can trust one human being, you know the knack of it and you can trust everybody.\n\u003c Previous | Contents\n","wordCount":"6187","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_sword_and_the_lotus/part24/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_sword_and_the_lotus/>The Sword and the Lotus</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">24 The master is at the door</h1><div class=post-meta>30 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;6187 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Sword_and_the_Lotus/part24.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part23>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a></p><p><span id=bookmark23>‌</span>CHAPTER <span class=s3>24</span></p><p><br></p><p>The master is at the door</p><p><br></p><p>13 February 1986 pm in</p><p><br></p><p>Question 1 BELOVED MASTER,</p><p>IN MY HEART I FEEL FULL OF DEVOTION AND RESPECT FOR YOU. SLOWLY,
SOMETHING INSIDE IS OPENING UP TOWARDS FRIENDSHIP WITH YOU. DO I HAVE TO
PASS THROUGH DEVOTION TO BECOME YOUR FRIEND? I SHALL REMAIN RESPECTFUL
AND PASS BOTH OF THEM TOGETHER.</p><p><br></p><p>They only can exist together. The friendship with a master is no
ordinary friendship. It has a reverence in it, love in it, devotion in
it, tremendous gratitude in it. It is a multidimensional phenomenon.</p><p><br></p><p>The ordinary friendship is a worldly thing, mundane. The spiritual
friendship is not of this world, it belongs to the beyond. I have to use
the same words which are used for the mundane because there are no other
words, so you have to be alert and aware that whatever I say, you cannot
find its meaning in a dictionary. It has much more in it. It is
immensely rich.</p><p><br></p><p>The word is small and very soft and the experience is vast and very
infinite. And I can see in you it is not just an intellectual question,
your heart is feeling immense pain because you are thinking that
friendship means you have to bypass devotion, respect, reverence, and
your heart is saying no.</p><p><br></p><p>Listen to the heart, not to the dictionary.</p><p>The heart never lies; the mind never tells the truth. The mind is a
great speaker; the heart is very silent but it also expresses itself in
tears.</p><p><br></p><p>Your question is immensely significant because it is coming from the
heart. The heart is feeling the pain because the mind has taken the word
‘friendship’ in an ordinary sense, ignoring the heart. The heart is full
of tears. Those tears are valuable.</p><p><br></p><p>The understanding of the mind has no significance. In the world of
spirituality it is only the heart that has to be listened to and
followed. Your heart is giving you the answer. I am simply repeating it
so that it becomes clear to you.</p><p><br></p><p>The friendship with the master includes everything that is beautiful
in all other relationships, and it excludes everything that is ugly in
all our human relationships. It is the pure essence, the very fragrance
of all our human relationships. It includes everything, but only the
best part of it, the very cream of it.</p><p><br></p><p>So don’t be worried, rejoice that it is happening to you and that
your heart is strong enough not to let the mind decide. Your heart is
strong enough to be the master and let the mind be simply a servant.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2 BELOVED MASTER,</p><p>WHEN THE MASTER IS STANDING AT THE DOOR WHAT SHOULD THE DISCIPLE
DO?</p><p><br></p><p>The question is from somebody very intellectual – perhaps a
professor. It is a mind question.</p><p><br></p><p>When the master is at the door it is too late! You cannot do
anything. You cannot close the door in the face of the master, you
cannot invite the master inside for the simple reason the ancient
scriptures of the East say the master is death – and they mean it.</p><p><br></p><p>To allow the master in means you will have to die as an ego, as a
personality, and that’s all you know about yourself. Hence the fear,
hence the question, what to do now? He is just at the door. One step
more and you are finished. But there is no need to be worried.</p><p><br></p><p>You will die as an ego but you will be reborn as the self, which is
your reality. You will die as a personality but you will be born as an
individuality, which is existential. Personality is just artificial.</p><p><br></p><p>The master can take away only those things which do not belong to
you. He cannot take anything away from you which is your authentic
nature. The master cannot give you anything, he simply removes all the
hindrances so that you can discover yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>I am reminded of one historical incident.…</p><p><br></p><p>The world’s best sculptor, Michelangelo, was passing through the
street where there were many shops of marble and different kinds of
stone sellers. He used to go there often to find good pieces of marble.
In front of the first shop, on the other side of the road, there was a
huge piece of marble,</p><p>very ugly looking, and it had been lying there for almost five years.
He had never paid any attention to it. He went around the marble, looked
at it, touched it, and was immensely happy. He came back to the owner of
the shop and asked, “What will you take for that stone?”</p><p><br></p><p>The shop owner said, “Nothing, you can take it, because I have kept
it for five years – and nobody wants it. And I am paying unnecessary
rent for it. I cannot keep it in the shop, it is too big. So I am
keeping it on the other side of the road on somebody else’s land, and he
is charging me rent for it. You are the first man in five years who has
even inquired about it. Thousands of sculptors have been coming to the
shop, but none has even paid attention to the stone. You can take it
joyfully, with my thanks. You need not pay for it because I am getting
fed up with it.”</p><p><br></p><p>Michelangelo arranged for the stone to be carried to his home, and he
said to the shopkeeper, “When I have worked it out I would love and
appreciate very much if you can come to see what has become of the
stone, because I have already seen it. It is only a question of chipping
the stone here and there. Somebody is encaged in the stone who has
called me, I have not to do much, I have not to create anything – just
to remove the unnecessary parts.”</p><p><br></p><p>And he created the most beautiful statue perhaps in the whole world –
a statue of Mary, Jesus’ mother, when she takes Jesus down from the
cross. Mary is sitting, and Jesus is lying in her lap dead... full-size;
the stone was so big. He worked for one year on it, and when it was
completed he asked the owner to come and see. The owner could not
believe that that ugly stone could be transformed into such a beautiful
statue as he had ever seen.</p><p><br></p><p>But Michelangelo said, “It was Mary and Jesus who called me. I was
coming into your shop and they called me, saying, ‘We are encaged in
this stone – just give us freedom.’”</p><p><br></p><p>That’s how every artist works. Before he starts making a statue he
has already seen it in his vision. Then he has just to remove the
unnecessary parts. The master is the greatest artist in the world. He
does not work with stones or marble, he works with living human beings.
When he accepts somebody to be a friend, it means he has seen the
vision, the possibility, the potentiality – what you can become.</p><p><br></p><p>You have chosen the master; you have invited him. Now he is at the
door, and you are freaking out. Your mind must be worried.</p><p><br></p><p>The master is certainly dangerous. If he is not dangerous he is not a
master at all. He is going to destroy much in you – only then the real
can be discovered. And you are asking me, what can be done when the
master is at the door.</p><p><br></p><p>You can do only one thing, being a professor, intellectual... I
remember a story in Mulla Nasruddin’s life.…</p><p>He used to visit the cafe every evening, and he always talked and
bragged about everything. That day he was bragging about his generosity,
hospitality, and a friend said, “Mulla, you can talk about other things,
but at least don’t talk about these things because we have been your
friends for years. You have never asked us even for a cup of tea. Every
day we have to pay for your coffee and anything that you eat in the
cafe. You have some nerve.”</p><p>He said, “You never remind me. Make me remember it. I am a man of
great spirituality and I don’t think about small, mundane things – a cup
of coffee or money, these things don’t matter. You should have reminded
me. Today you have reminded me. You all are invited to my house. Come
for dinner. The whole cafe... friends, acquaintances, strangers.… It
doesn’t matter, everybody has to come; then you will know how generous I
am.”</p><p><br></p><p>They could not believe it, but he was inviting, so they followed him,
a great crowd. And as the house came nearer, Mulla started walking
slower. They said, “What is the matter, Mulla?”</p><p><br></p><p>Mulla said, “You all know. You are all married. I am also married, so
there is nothing to be kept secret. I forgot all about my wife. Talking
about great things I forgot about my wife. In fact, in the morning she
had sent me to purchase vegetables and it is night now and I have wasted
the whole day talking about spirituality and great things. And finally I
ended up with you, and now I am coming with a crowd for dinner and there
is nothing in the house. You can understand my situation. She will kill
me.”</p><p><br></p><p>They said, “This is strange. You should have remembered. How should
we know it? But now we are not going back.”</p><p><br></p><p>Mulla said, “I am not telling you to go back. You just remain
standing at the door. Let me go in and persuade my wife; it will take a
few minutes. I am sorry, but you will have to wait, because if I enter
with this whole crowd, she will go mad.”</p><p><br></p><p>They understood; they had the same problems. They said, “Okay, we
will wait for a few minutes. You go and persuade your wife.”</p><p><br></p><p>Mulla went in and told her, “A gang of stupid people is following me.
Now only you can save me.” The wife said, “What is the matter?”</p><p>He said, “Nothing is the matter. You simply go there and ask them,
‘Why are you standing here?’ And they will certainly say, ‘We are
waiting here for Mulla Nasruddin.’ And you can say, ‘He has not been
seen since the morning. He had gone to purchase vegetables and I have
been waiting the whole day.’”</p><p><br></p><p>The woman said, “Strange... why so many people should come and...”
Mulla said, “But you have to save me. It is a question of prestige.”</p><p>The wife went out, opened the door, and said to the people, “What are
you doing here?”</p><p><br></p><p>They said, “We are not doing anything. We are simply staying here
because Mulla told us to stay here.”</p><p><br></p><p>The wife said, “He has not been seen since the morning.”</p><p><br></p><p>They said, “This is something. He came with us, we all are
eyewitnesses – in front of us he entered into the room.”</p><p>The wife said, “You must be mistaken, he is not in the house.”</p><p><br></p><p>They said, “Then we would like to look in the house because he has
invited us for dinner.” The wife said, “Dinner?”</p><p>At that point – Mulla was listening to the whole conversation from
the second story; he had opened the window a little bit and was watching
what was happening. When they said that they were going to search the
house he thought, “This is going to be difficult.”</p><p><br></p><p>He shouted from the window, “You are simply idiots. He may have come
with you but you don’t understand logic, he may have gone from the back
door. Are you not ashamed arguing with a poor woman? Feel ashamed and go
back home!”</p><p><br></p><p>Now he forgot that you cannot deny yourself – that is impossible. You
cannot say, I may have gone from the back door. Then who is talking? But
in the fury, in the anger, and they were trying to force themselves into
the house, and the poor wife would not be able to prevent them and he
was bound to be caught...!</p><p><br></p><p>You are in the same situation. You can tell the master that you are
not at home. That’s what millions of people are saying, that they are
not at home. So it is not just a joke, it is a reality for millions of
people. All the people who deny the existence of the soul are saying, “I
am not at home.” Then who is denying?</p><p><br></p><p>Half the world is communist today. They don’t believe in the soul;
they argue about it. I have been arguing with many communists, and I was
surprised that they are not aware of a simple thing: who is arguing?</p><p><br></p><p>You are conscious, and you are denying consciousness. You are alive,
and you are denying the very principle of life. You are in a really
difficult situation, you cannot escape now. That’s why I said it is too
late. It is better to invite the master in, because he won’t care about
your invitation, he is going to enter in.</p><p><br></p><p>He is your master. You have accepted him as your master, and
unconsciously you may have invited him many times to come to you, and
now he has come. Now there is no way to escape. It is better to accept
the fact that he is going to kill you as you have known you up to now,
and he is going to give you a new birth.</p><p><br></p><p>Socrates used to say that the basic function of the master is just to
give birth, but every birth has to be preceded by death. Once you
understand it, once you have passed through such an experience of death
and birth, then you will live each moment of your life dying to the past
and being reborn anew in the present. Then each moment is a death and a
rebirth, and that is the only real life. Then you don’t carry dead
weight of so many years, of so many lives – an unnecessary burden which
does not allow you to live lightly, lovingly, dancingly.</p><p><br></p><p>If the master has come to the gate you are fortunate – let him come
in just for once, because next time he will not come. Next time you will
be doing the same yourself. You will know the key.</p><p>That death, every death, opens doors for new and fresh life. If you
want to be alive intensely, you have to allow death to happen every
moment and then you will know a totally new taste of vitality, of youth,
of energy, of freshness. And with your freshness, the whole existence
becomes fresh. With your youth, the whole existence becomes young.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard about one chief justice of the Supreme Court of America.
When he retired he told his wife... and they had remained together for
almost sixty years. They had had their honeymoon in Paris. He said,
“Before I die I have a great desire to go back to Paris to the same
hotel, to the same room, to visit the same places that we visited when
we had our honeymoon.”</p><p><br></p><p>The wife was also excited. They both went to Paris – the hotel was
the same, the room was the same, the places they went to see were the
same. But the old man said, “Something seems to be very dull, old. It is
no longer the same Paris. I don’t see the same joy and the same dance
and the same beauty.”</p><p><br></p><p>His wife was more pragmatic – wives are always more pragmatic, more
earthbound. She took the hand of the old man and told him, “You are
wrong. Paris is exactly the same, perhaps more beautiful. In sixty years
it has become bigger, more beautiful, better. But you have forgotten one
thing: this is not our honeymoon, and we have become sixty years older.
It is our old eyes which are so full of dust and death that we cannot
see the youth and the freshness and the beauty. Don’t say Paris is no
longer Paris, simply say that we are no longer the same.”</p><p><br></p><p>She was saying a great truth: the world is what you are. If you are
frustrated, sad, miserable, you will see the same things all around. And
if you are joyous, your heart is full of song, you will see the whole
world with songs and dances and flowers and fragrance. It all depends on
you.</p><p><br></p><p>So don’t be worried. It is a blessing that the master is at the door.
It happens only to the fortunate ones.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 3 BELOVED MASTER,</p><p>MA VEENA HAS DECEASED, AND WAS JUST BORN AGAIN WITH THE NEW NAME, MA
PREM VIDEH. SHE HAS ENTERED INTO A NEW WORLD FEELING QUITE
DIFFERENT.</p><p><br></p><p>BUT I AM A LITTLE CONFUSED. PLEASE WOULD YOU LIKE TO TELL ME ABOUT
IT?</p><p><br></p><p>It is not only the experience of Veena who has died in becoming a
sannyasin, and is born as Videh. This is the experience of millions of
sannyasins around the world.…</p><p><br></p><p>Initiation is death and life.</p><p><br></p><p>Initiation is a discontinuity with the past.</p><p><br></p><p>You had lived a life, you had experienced many things, but all your
experiences and your whole life were not a fulfillment. It was not a
contentment, it was not ecstatic; it was more misery, more</p><p>suffering, more pain. It was more dragging than living. That is the
reason one starts looking for a new way of life, a new mode of
existence.</p><p><br></p><p>Sannyas is a revolution.</p><p><br></p><p>It simply means that you are finished with the past, and you don’t
want to repeat it. You have repeated it enough, and the repetition has
made you almost a robot. It does not give joy. Every morning it is the
same, every evening it is the same – tomorrow will be simply another
carbon copy of today.</p><p><br></p><p>How can you feel like rejoicing? Every day is bringing you nearer to
the end. Death will come and erase you just the way people go and write
their names on the beach, their signatures, and a wave comes and erases
it all.</p><p><br></p><p>Death comes and erases you completely as if you had never been here.
Do you know how many people have been here? Each person is sitting on
the corpses of at least ten persons. Every inch of the earth has been a
graveyard.</p><p><br></p><p>I am reminded of a very famous Sufi story.…</p><p><br></p><p>One king was unable to sleep in the night. He was tossing and turning
when he heard somebody on the roof of the palace, walking. He shouted,
“Who is there?”</p><p><br></p><p>The man said, “It is none of your business. I am searching for my
camel.”</p><p><br></p><p>The king said, “You seem to be an utter idiot. Camels don’t get lost
on people’s roofs.”</p><p><br></p><p>But the man said, “It is true I am an idiot, but no more than you,
because what you are searching for in this palace your father was also
searching for, your grandfather was also searching for. For generations
you have been searching in this palace and you have not found anything.
You are wasting your time, and your death is not far away. It is
possible that a camel may get lost on a roof, but it is impossible to
find contentment, blissfulness the way you are searching for them and in
the place where you are searching for them.”</p><p><br></p><p>And his voice was so authoritative. The king had never in his life
come across another man... he had only dealt with servants, soldiers,
his own people, and they were always saying “Yes, sir.” And this man
shouted from the roof.</p><p><br></p><p>The king called his guards. A great search was made but the man could
not be caught.</p><p><br></p><p>The next morning the king was sitting in the court thinking about the
man. Slowly, slowly he had calmed down and was thinking that perhaps he
was right. “It was not the right way to tell me such a thing – in the
middle of the night on my own roof – but what he said seemed to be
significant. And the man cannot be mad!”</p><p><br></p><p>At that very moment another man at the door started arguing with the
guard, “I want to stay in this caravanserai for a few days.”</p><p>The guard said, “You must be mad. This is the king’s own palace, his
own home. There is a caravanserai, you can go half a mile more and you
will find it.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I want to stay in this caravanserai!”</p><p><br></p><p>The guard said, “But you seem to be absolutely stupid. You don’t
understand a simple thing, that this is a palace.”</p><p><br></p><p>The king was listening from inside; the voice was the same. He told
the guards, “Bring that man in. I have been looking for him.”</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at the man; he said, “Are you not the same man who was
looking for the camel on my roof?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “So you have come down to your senses. Yes, I am the man.
And I had to do this just to make you aware that neither can camels be
found on the roofs of houses nor can bliss be found in a caravanserai
which you are mistakenly believing is your own house.</p><p><br></p><p>“I came here before and there was another man – you were not here –
and he was claiming the same thing, that it was his house. I came before
that, and there was another man, and he was also claiming that this was
his house. Now you are claiming it. I can say with guarantee, that the
fourth time I come I will find somebody else claiming the same.”</p><p><br></p><p>The king said, “You are right. One was my father, the other was my
grandfather, the other was my great-grandfather. And it is possible that
next time you come perhaps you may find my son in my place – I am
getting old. But to what conclusion are you trying to lead me?”</p><p><br></p><p>The man laughed. He said, “You have understood the conclusion – that
it is a caravanserai, and many people have lived here and gone. It is
nobody’s home. In this whole earth there is no home, only caravanserais.
Why not accept a fact?”</p><p><br></p><p>The impact of the man, his personality, was so much that the king
immediately left the home and he said, “He is right. His methods are a
little mad, but I have heard about many Sufis who use methods which look
mad but their madness is only a device. I have understood. I am leaving
this caravanserai in search of my home.”</p><p><br></p><p>This man became a very famous Sufi himself. He went outside the
capital, made a small hut there at the crossroads, and lived there. And
every day there was trouble, because anybody who would come to the
crossroads would ask, “Which road leads to the city?”</p><p><br></p><p>And he would say, “Go right and you will reach the eternal city.” For
a moment they would think, “eternal city...?”</p><p><br></p><p>But one forgives mystics! These people talk strange things.… “But
this is the road...?” They would say, “You are certain?”</p><p>He would say, “I am absolutely certain. You can go and find it
yourself” – and that was the road leading to the graveyard.</p><p><br></p><p>And those people would come back furious, and would tell him, “You
seem to be really mad. There is no city, there is a graveyard.”</p><p><br></p><p>But the king would say, “I told you beforehand it is the eternal
city. Once a person starts residing there, he resides forever. It is the
real city, you should have asked about the unreal city. The road on the
left goes to the unreal city – where people live for a few days thinking
that this is the city and finally have to leave and go to the eternal
city. And I am always in trouble. People ask for the real city and I
show them the real city, then they come with anger. You can go to the
unreal city this way, but remember, that is an unreal city. Don’t take
it for granted that it is real. I also used to live there. I want to
find the real home before death finds me.”</p><p><br></p><p>One becomes a sannyasin to find the real home, to find something of
eternity, to find something which death cannot destroy. Certainly, it
cannot be the body – it is a caravanserai. It cannot be the mind – it
changes constantly.</p><p><br></p><p>Initiation into sannyas is the beginning of the search for something
beyond mind. And one who takes initiation with a deep love, a great
adventure, understanding that whatever way he has lived was not right,
that it was the dark night of the soul, and he is entering into the
world of light... A simple initiation which for the outsiders will mean
nothing, but for the person himself it is a mutation – his whole being
is changed. His past drops from him and the future opens its doors. Now
he starts living for the first time as a conscious human being. And this
consciousness goes on growing.</p><p><br></p><p>So what has happened to the questioner is a reality which has
happened to many, many people. And this is the reason we change the name
in sannyas – just to give you an indication that now you are no longer
the old self. Just a hint to let the old be dead and begin anew, fresh
from the very scratch – a new life, a new being, a new love, a new
consciousness. Enter into a new universal truth.</p><p><br></p><p>I am happy, Videh, that Veena is dead. Rejoice in the death of Veena,
and rejoice in the birth of Videh.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 4 BELOVED MASTER,</p><p>I AM HAPPIER AS YOUR SANNYASIN COMPARED TO MY LIFE BEFORE SANNYAS.
BUT I DON’T FEEL LIKE MEDITATING OR PRAYING. WITHOUT PRAYING AND
MEDITATING THE CHANGES HAPPEN ANYWAY, AND I AM HAPPY AND CONTENTED. THIS
SEED OF BEING SAD HAS TO GO.</p><p><br></p><p>SHOULD I FORCE MYSELF TO MEDITATE, OR SHOULD I WAIT AND LET THIS
HAPPINESS GROW, OR SHOULD I BE AS I WAS?</p><p><br></p><p>I AM CONFUSED. ONLY YOU CAN GUIDE ME PROPERLY, BECAUSE I DON’T TRUST
ANYONE BUT YOU.</p><p>First, there is no need to go back and live a sad and miserable life.
That suits the stupid and the idiots, not anyone who has a little bit of
intelligence. Life is to rejoice, life is to dance.</p><p><br></p><p>Life is to drink the juice of it as totally as possible.</p><p><br></p><p>I am reminded of an incident in paradise, in a restaurant.…</p><p><br></p><p>Lao Tzu, Confucius and Gautam Buddha – all three were sitting around
a table discussing great things. Just at that moment a naked woman,
immensely beautiful, came with a jar to the side of the table and asked
them, “Would you like to taste some juice of life?”</p><p><br></p><p>Gautam Buddha simply closed his eyes – he did not reply.</p><p><br></p><p>Confucius half closed his eyes – he believes in the golden mean. And
he said to the girl, “I would just like to taste, not to drink. I would
just like to know how it tastes.” So he had taken just a sip and he
said, “It is bitter. You take it away.”</p><p><br></p><p>Lao Tzu took the whole jar from the girl’s hands and drank it
completely in one gulp. Even the girl was surprised. Emptying the jar,
he said, “Great. It was delicious. But to know anything really, one has
to go totally into it. It was bitter to you, Confucius, because you are
unaware of the new taste of life. You don’t have a trained tongue,
trained buds; you have never lived life. You have always been an
outsider on the boundaries with your half-closed eyes. Whatever you see
is incomplete. Truth can never be seen incomplete – either you see it or
you don’t see it. Truth is indivisible.</p><p><br></p><p>“I had to drink the whole of the juice. Please forgive me. Without
drinking the whole, it is impossible to give any judgment. You both are
incapable of giving any judgment. Gautam Buddha is absolutely out
because he knows no taste and he has closed eyes, he has not even seen
how it looks. He has not seen the beautiful woman who has brought it. He
is making himself blind and dumb; he is closing himself against life. So
whatever he says about life is irrelevant.</p><p><br></p><p>“And I will not trust any word from you either. Half-closed eyes can
only give you a half truth. In just taking a sip, it may not even have
reached into your stomach, you may not have digested it. It has not
become blood and bone in you, and unless truth becomes your very being,
your very heart, you have no right to say anything about it.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am the only one with fully open eyes who has drunk it
totally.”</p><p><br></p><p>I love the story. It certainly is a story, because in paradise there
are no restaurants – in hell there are.</p><p><br></p><p>In paradise what will you do with restaurants? Saints don’t like
restaurants. The restaurants would not find any customers. They would
have gone bankrupt a long time ago. So it is simply an example, a
parable, but very significant.</p><p><br></p><p>So the first thing is: you are not to go back to sadness and misery,
and even though I am saying you are not to go back, I don’t mean that
you can – there is no way; you cannot. There is nothing to go back to.
You were sad and miserable, now you are contented and happy. Why in the
world should you choose to go back?</p><p>As far as meditation or prayer is concerned, remember, you cannot
force them. There are things in life which you cannot do violently,
which you have only to wait for silently, inviting, welcoming, with open
doors, awake and alert so that when the guest comes you can welcome the
guest. And it is already happening to you. You say you have not
meditated, still you are finding deep contentment and happiness. If
there is contentment it means that without your knowing, some qualities
of meditation have entered into you. Without knocking on your door,
happiness has made a way into you.</p><p><br></p><p>The connection between contentment, happiness, misery and sadness is
almost like light and darkness. If you suddenly find that darkness has
disappeared from your being, whether you know it or not, light has
entered. Without the entry of light, the darkness cannot go.</p><p><br></p><p>So my suggestion is that first be grateful that even though you have
not meditated... you have just been listening to me. But in just
listening to me something in you has become silent, for a few moments
there has been a gap in your thinking. There have been times when you
were there but there was no ego. Just sitting here, waiting for what I
am going to say – in that gap, contentment has entered.</p><p><br></p><p>In America, hundreds of television reporters used to come, and their
only complaint with me was: “What can be said in ten minutes you take
twenty minutes. We have a limited time and we don’t want to cut anything
because whatever you are saying is so interconnected that if we cut
anything it will be out of context. Why can’t you speak like everybody
else? Why do you suddenly become silent? You speak a word and then you
leave a gap.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “This is the way I am going to speak, because it is a
question not only of speaking, it is a question of giving moments of
meditation to the people who are listening to me.</p><p><br></p><p>“While I am speaking they are engaged, their minds are filled with
me. When suddenly I stop for a moment, their minds also stop,
waiting.<span class=s4></span>And those are the most beautiful
moments, when they</p><p>have a taste of meditation without knowing that they are
meditating.”</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what has happened to you. You have been in touch with
meditation up to now without awareness. From now on you have to be fully
aware. Contentment and happiness indicate – they are symptoms that a
change has started happening inside you. No need to force, just go on as
you are, enjoying your contentment more, allowing the same situation in
which it happens, relishing every bit of happiness that comes to you and
watching when it comes, what is the situation in which it comes. So move
in that situation more and more. No need to force meditation, no need to
force anything. Simply create the right atmosphere in which those things
start happening on their own.</p><p><br></p><p>And they are already happening. So you have just to see the knack of
how they are happening and go on very easily, at ease, without any
tension, without any effort, without any enforcement. Because the danger
is if you become greedy and if you want them to happen more and you try
to force them, you may destroy even that which is happening. So no
effort, no will has to be involved in it.</p><p>You have to be simply waiting. And waiting is prayer.</p><p>Waiting for the unknown to enter in you. Waiting to be pregnant with
the divine.</p><p>You cannot do anything about it, but you can wait.</p><p><br></p><p>And the last thing: you said you trust only me. If just by trusting
me so much is happening to you, just think if you trust everybody how
much more will be happening to you. Trusting a single human being has
changed your life from sadness to contentment. If you can trust
everybody without conditions, you will see a tremendous revolution
happening every moment in your life, raising your consciousness to more
and more glory and grandeur and splendor. Why distrust anybody?</p><p><br></p><p>People distrust because they are afraid that trust can make them
vulnerable, people can cheat them easily. So they close themselves. They
lock all the doors, all the windows so nobody can cheat them, nobody can
deceive them. But they don’t know that by locking all the doors, all the
windows, they are preventing the sun to enter, they are preventing the
fresh breeze to blow in, they are preventing the fragrances of the roses
to come in. Of course, they have prevented the thieves also from coming
in. What can thieves take away from you? You are just sad and miserable.
Are you afraid they will take away your sadness and your misery? What
have you got that you are worried about?</p><p><br></p><p>It happened to Mulla Nasruddin.…</p><p><br></p><p>He used to sleep with all the windows open – according to my advice –
all the doors open.<span class=s4></span>And</p><p>naturally, a thief entered, and he collected everything in the
house.</p><p><br></p><p>Mulla was sleeping on a blanket. Seeing that the man had collected
everything, he threw his blanket also on his pile. The thief was
surprised. He said, “I thought you were asleep.”</p><p><br></p><p>Mulla said, “I was pretending.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You are a strange man – I am a thief.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “No worry. You can take everything away – I am coming with
you. Because what does it matter in which house we live? I will live
with you. And I have found a servant. I was looking for a servant, and
it is so difficult nowadays to find a servant. You have come on your
own. Now where is your house?”</p><p><br></p><p>What can people take away? Death is going to take it away at any
moment. You have come into the world empty-handed, and you will go from
the world empty-handed, so it does not matter. Between these two<span class=s4></span>What you have in your hands does not matter. What
matters is that you lost trust, which</p><p>is an immense treasure of your being.</p><p><br></p><p>By trusting everybody you can lose a few things. They may steal your
money, but if you can continue to trust even those<span class=s4></span>trust is a great treasure. Trusting people who can
cheat you, who are going to</p><p>cheat you, is real trust.</p><p><br></p><p>I am not going to cheat you, I am not going to steal anything from
your house. I have already stolen you. I am a different kind of man.
When I have stolen you, I have stolen everything. Why bother about each
thing separately – I do a wholesale job.</p><p>Now you don’t have anything! You and all that you have belongs to me.
So if people take away a few things, let me worry about it, you go on
trusting.</p><p><br></p><p>But trust the whole of humanity. Whatever happens, don’t lose your
trust, because trust is so valuable. It is going to give you all that
meditation can give, all that prayer can give, and without any effort.
And if you can trust one human being, you know the knack of it and you
can trust everybody.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part23>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a></p><p>  </p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://osho.lol/posts/from_misery_to_enlightenment/part24/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>24 The key to unawareness: keep thinking</span>

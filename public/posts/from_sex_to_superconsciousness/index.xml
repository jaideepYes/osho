‌CHAPTER 1
Sex, the genesis of love
28 August 1968 pm in Gowalior Tank Maidan
Question 1 WHAT IS LOVE?
To feel it is easy, to define love is difficult indeed. If you ask a fish what the sea is like, the fish will say, “This is the sea. The sea is all around. And that’s that.” But if you insist – “Please define the sea” – then the problem becomes very difficult indeed.</description>

From repression to emancipation

Early one morning, before sunrise, a fisherman went to a river. On the bank he felt something underfoot, and found it to be a small sack of stones. He picked up the sack, and putting his net aside, squatted on the bank to await the sunrise. He was waiting for dawn to break in order to start his day’s work.</description>

The pinnacle of meditation

‌CHAPTER 4
Sex, the super-atom
30 September 1968 pm in Gowalior Tank Maidan

He recited the couplet: kabira khada bazarmen liye lukathi hath; jo ghar barai aapna chale hamare saath.</description>

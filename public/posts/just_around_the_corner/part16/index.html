Veet means going beyond, transcending, surpassing. Peter means a rock, a stone. Man is born as a rock but has to become a flower. Unless the rock of the heart opens and becomes a lotus life is in vain. And that’s what happens in most cases: people are born as rocks, they live as rocks, they die as rocks."><meta name=author content="Osho"><link rel=canonical href=https://osho.lol/posts/just_around_the_corner/part16/><meta name=google-site-verification content="XYZabc"><meta name=yandex-verification content="XYZabc"><meta name=msvalidate.01 content="XYZabc"><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.b609c58d5c11bb90b1a54e04005d74ad1ddf22165eb79f5533967e57df9c3b50.css integrity="sha256-tgnFjVwRu5CxpU4EAF10rR3fIhZet59VM5Z+V9+cO1A=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=mask-icon href=https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://osho.lol/posts/just_around_the_corner/part16/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:title" content="16"><meta property="og:description" content="< Previous | Contents | Next >

Peter means a rock, a stone. Man is born as a rock but has to become a flower. Unless the rock of the heart opens and becomes a lotus life is in vain. And that’s what happens in most cases: people are born as rocks, they live as rocks, they die as rocks. In fact life never happened to them. They never knew anything worth knowing, they never lived a moment of ecstasy, joy, utter abandon. They never knew what it means to be. They were and yet they were not.\nThe heart closed is a rock; the heart open is a lotus. The rock is hiding a lotus inside it. The rock is not just a rock; it has infinite potentialities.\nMan has to work on the rock, hammer on the rock so that slowly slowly the hidden comes to the surface, so that the hard crust is broken and the hard crust dies. Then life is born. That is a rebirth. That is real birth because then there is no death. The unreal birth brings death; the real birth brings deathlessness, eternity.\nDeva means divine, Yutaka means richness – divine richness. Man is poor, man is poverty. Without God, man is just a zero. As God enters into your life richness enters. And as God enters your life you start disappearing. You cannot be rich, your very existence is your poverty. Disappear, make way for God. Allow him to come in and possess you. Then life is so abundant, so affluent, so rich, that we cannot even dream about it right now. One cannot imagine what life can be. The beggar cannot imagine what the emperor is. But everybody is trying to reach to that richness. Wrongly, rightly, we are all groping for it.\nIf we grope wrongly we go on becoming more and more poor. The wrong way is to think that by becoming rich in things one is going to become really rich. You can possess all the things of the\nCHAPTER 16. world and yet you will be poor unless God possesses you. The man of possessions is a poor man and the man who is possessed by the divine is rich.\nGreat courage is needed to be possessed by God; great madness is needed to be possessed by God; great love is needed to be possessed by God.\nSannyas is nothing but an initiation into that kind of madness, but that madness is not madness: it is the highest intelligence, the greatest sanity.\nAnand means bliss, Viru means courageous, courage – a blissful courage. That is the most important quality for the seeker. One needs courage because it is an adventure into the unknown. But the courage has to be cheerful, singing, dancing; it should not be serious. If it is serious it becomes a heavy load. And unfortunately that’s what happens to so-called seekers of truth: they become long faces, they become very serious, holier-than-thou. They are always judging others as condemned. They are always thinking of themselves as special. Those become the hindrances.\nBe playful, cheerful, blissful. The search for God is not a serious affair. It is not work – it is play.\nAnand means bliss, Chetan means consciousness. Misery is a byproduct of unconsciousness. It is just by remaining sleepy that we create misery. It is the sleepy person who goes on stumbling, falling into traps, and goes on creating more drunkard: he cannot walk straight, he falls into the gutter. He cannot get out; he is not even conscious of where he is. That’s the normal state of human beings.\nBliss is a byproduct of consciousness. The more conscious you become, the more blissful you are. In fact because you become conscious you become incapable of creating misery for yourself. And when there is no misery-creating mechanism in you, of course there is bliss. Bliss is your nature. If you don’t create misery you will be blissful. Blissfulness is not something that has to be achieved.\nMisery is achieved. That is a great achievement and it needs much work and much mind. Unless you put yourself into creating it with a great determination and perseverance you cannot create misery.\nBliss is very simple, spontaneous. All that is needed is not to create misery and you will find bliss. Once the mechanism that creates misery stops functioning bliss wells up. Suddenly you are permeated by a new sweetness, a new benediction which you had never known before. And that is the taste of God: bliss is the taste of God.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"790","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/just_around_the_corner/part16/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/just_around_the_corner/>Just Around the Corner</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">16</h1><div class=post-meta>4 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;790 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Just_Around_the_Corner/part16.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part15>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

Love brings both: it brings victory, it brings immortality. Love is the only experience in which defeat is impossible because the very first requirement of being in love is to be surrendered. If a person is surrendered how can he be defeated? He has accepted defeat himself – how can you defeat him? And that is love’s secret of victory: it cannot be defeated.\nAnd love is also the only experience in life which gives you some glimpse of immortality, of deathlessness – only glimpses, but those glimpses are of tremendous importance. The whole of life will be changed through them.\nIt is through love that you feel that you are not just the body but something more. It is through love that you become aware of your spirit. It is through love that you become aware that time can be transcended, and time transcended is death conquered.\nPrem means love, Sergio means to serve. Service can be without love; it can be just a duty, one has to fulfill it. One’s heart is not in it; it is not one’s joy. Maybe there is some motivation of some rewards later on, in this life or in the other, but the act of service in itself is joyless unless it arises out of love. Service should not be done according to religious commandments. It should not be made a virtue. It should be a consequence of a loving person, a natural fragrance of love; no effort should be made for it. Only then does it have beauty. When it arises out of love with no motivation, with no end in view there is great benediction. And those are the moments when God is the closest.\nService cannot be Christian or Hindu or Mohammedan: it can only be loving. Anything to say to me?\n[He replies: Many things but I don t feel able to express them.]\nThere is no need. I understand them without you ever saying them. I go on answering you without you ever questioning.\nAll that is needed on the part of the disciple is to be silent and awaiting. Whenever anything is needed, it will be given. If it is not needed, only then is it not given. Questioning is not of any relevance. Communion is needed, and that’s what sannyas is for. It is not a communication but a communion; it is not a dialogue but a meeting of two hearts. Nothing needs to be said!\nAnand means bliss, Jose means a gift of God. Bliss is not through effort, it is through God’s grace. You cannot achieve it, you can only receive it. The achieving mind is one of the barriers in finding bliss. The achieving mind has to cease for bliss to be.\nIn the world, everything is achieved through effort, but in the inner world, in the world of God, everything is afforded, achieved through non-effort. It is simple but not easy. It is simple because nothing has to be done, but it is not easy because we have become so accustomed to doing.\nFrom the very childhood we start telling children: Don’t sit there – do something! If you want to go in you will have to learn just the opposite rule: Don’t do anything – just sit there!\nThis is your name: Swami Prem Kalli. Prem means love, and have you invented Kalli yourself, from Karl?\n[KALLI: Yes.]\nGood! Karl means strong, manly, brave, but in Hindi Kalli has a far more beautiful meaning: it means the mother goddess. It is just the opposite of the German – not manly but womanly. Strong certainly, but a totally different kind of strength; the feminine strength. You have changed Karl to Kalli; now completely forget about the origin. Now let it become mother goddess.\nEach man is both man and woman, and each woman is both woman and man, and we have to come to a deep merger of these two elements. In that merger is strength, is power; immense power is released. It is far more significant than the power released by an atomic explosion. It is not the power of explosion but the power of implosion. The atom has to be broken, then it releases energy, but in the inner world man has to be integrated – not broken, not split, but centered, crystallized – then power is released.\nThe man and the woman inside have to meet and merge, so let Karl and Kalli meet and merge and become one. And that happens through love. When you love a woman it is not only the woman on the outside that you love, in a vicarious way, in an indirect way you love your inner woman too through her. In fact you fall in love with a woman only if she somehow resembles your inner woman, otherwise you will not fall in love in the first place\nThe resemblance may not be too much, the resemblance may be very little and may be finished sooner or later, but there is certainly some echo. That echo is love. Something of your heart is reflected. Falling in love with a woman or falling in love with a man is really deep down falling in love\nwith one’s own polar opposite. And both those poles exist in you: one is Karl, the other is Kalli; and both have to meet.\nAnd just as the child is born out of the mother, never out of the man, exactly the same happens when the man and the woman inside meet, again the man disappears into the woman. The mother is left there again. The beginning is the mother and the end is the mother.\nIf one day you come across God you will be surprised: you will not find that he is a man, you will find that he is a woman. He is a she!\nPrem means love, Git means song – a love song. And that’s my message: your life has to become a love song. It has to drop being prose, it has to become poetry. It has to drop being logic, it has to become love. You have to disappear from the head and appear in the heart. It is a long dive from the head to the heart, but it is the most important thing. Nothing can be more important than this dive from the head to the heart. The head lives in a kind of hell, the head is hell, and the heart is heaven.\nIt is not through thinking that one arrives home: it is through feeling. So think less, feel more.\nAnand means bliss, Verena means sacred wisdom. A few things have to be understood. One: all wisdom is sacred. That which is not sacred is not wisdom, it is knowledge, information. Wisdom is necessarily sacred because it descends from God into you. It is not part of your memory. You cannot learn it in a school, it cannot be taught to you, you have to catch it. And the way to catch it is to be utterly open to the beyond, available to the beyond.\nIt comes dancing, it comes pouring, but it comes from the unknown. And the moment it comes it transforms you. Your life starts having a new flavor, and flavor of holiness, sacredness, purity. Sometimes that kind of atmosphere is found in a temple, an ancient temple, in a pyramid, in a mosque, in a cathedral, but rarely. But that kind of milieu starts surrounding the person in whom something of the sacred has descended. And when it comes it creates a great dance; it brings bliss. That is the indication that it has come.\nThe scholar is serious; the wise man is blissful. The scholar is very miserly. He cannot even laugh, he cannot even smile. But the wise man can have a belly laugh. He is more playful, more like a child. Wisdom brings sacredness, innocence; it brings back your childhood with a new depth and a new richness.\nThe child was simply ignorant, but when wisdom comes you are innocent and not ignorant. Your innocence is a knowing innocence – uncorrupted by knowledge but full of insight, vision, clarity.\nDeva means divine, Hanne means grace – divine grace. Depend on divine grace, trust divine grace. People trust too much in their own egos and hence they suffer.\nTo trust in the wave is bound to bring suffering, because the wave is only a temporary phenomenon, momentary: one moment it is there, another moment it is gone. You cry and weep and do whatsoever you want to do, but it is not coming back to you. It is simply gone; it no more exists.\nTrust in the ocean and then you will never be in suffering and never be in misery, because the ocean always is.\nThe ego is just a flux in movement. It is very illusory, exactly like ripples on the lake. When you throw a stone in the lake it creates an illusion, as if ripples are arising and those ripples are going towards the bank. Nothing is going anywhere. It is not that the first wave is going to touch the bank, no. The first wave simply waves another wave and the second waves the third. Nothing is going anywhere, although from the outside it looks as if waves are moving, as if there is great movement. Nothing is moving; movement is false. It is just that the surface is disturbed, that’s all.\nYou can try it by dropping a piece of paper. You will be surprised: the wave goes on but the piece of paper remains in the same place. The waves cannot take it away, because they are not really going – it is just that the surface is waving. Exactly like waves, the ego is an illusion: the surface is waving.\nTrust the depth, and that’s what the meaning of God is: your innermost depth. If one can trust that, great grace arises in life. Everything suddenly becomes smooth, harmonious, everything suddenly fits.\nJust as before nothing was fitting, now everything simply fits. Life is no more a jigsaw puzzle, it becomes a tremendous harmony. And harmony is grace and grace is divine. Man can attain it too only by surrendering to the divine.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"1762","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/just_around_the_corner/part3/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/just_around_the_corner/>Just Around the Corner</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">3</h1><div class=post-meta>9 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1762 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Just_Around_the_Corner/part3.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part2>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

‌CHAPTER 1
If you can accept your ignorance your life will have the quality of
magic
4 December 1976 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Deva means divine, and agyana means ignorance; divine ignorance. And this has to be understood. All knowledge is superfluous. Knowledge as such is superfluous. And all knowledge creates only an illusion that we know – we don’t know. You can live with a man your whole life, and you can think that you know him – and you don’t know him.</description>

Only the Innocent can be Blissful
14 December 1976 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Anand means bliss, happiness, and abodha means innocence; innocent bliss. And remember this – that bliss is never knowledgeable, and a man of knowledge is never blissful. Only innocent people can be blissful, only children can be blissful. Those who don’t know, only they can be blissful. The more you know, the less is the possibility of being blissful.</description>

‌CHAPTER 13
Nature Can Become a Stepping Stone to God
17 December 1976 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Deva means divine, manglam means blessing... and that’s how I look at life – it is a divine blessing. Many people think so negatively about life that it almost looks like a curse. And there are philosophies that think that life is an accident... meaningless. If one starts looking that way, life becomes that way, because your outlook is going to become your reality.</description>

Prem means love; love of christ. And christ is not a person. When the personality disappears, when the ego disappears, when the sense of ‘I’ disappears, christ is born.

And christ is not a person. When the personality disappears, when the ego disappears, when the sense of ‘I’ disappears, christ is born.\nEvery time somebody reaches into his innermost core, christ is born again. It is not a historical thing that happened once and then stopped. Krishna is also a Christ and Buddha too.\nChrist is a state. It has nothing to do with Jesus in particular – Jesus is one of the Christs. There have been many before him, there have been many after, and there will continue to be many more. So think of christ as a state – the state of no-mind, the state when thinking stops and you are simply aware. Not aware of something in particular, but simply aware. Not aware of any object... your awareness is not focused on anything. You cannot say of what you are aware; you can simply say, ‘I am aware.’ That is the state of christ.\nAnd it is ugly to become a Christian, it is ugly to become a Hindu, ugly to become a Mohammedan – but it is beautiful to become a Christ, to become a Mohammed, to become a Krishna. These are states. They arc not confined to persons, territories, geography, climate, creed; they are not confined to anything.\nThat is the entry of the beyond within you: when suddenly your drop disappears and the ocean is there... infinite... when the unbounded has descended in you.\nWhen you cannot separate yourself from existence, when the marriage has happened, when you are wed to existence, that is the state of being a christ.\nChristo prem will mean the love for the state of no-mind; the search for the state of no-mind.\nSo this night, let christ be born to you; let the drama be enacted again. It has to be enacted in every consciousness. Every consciousness is a stage, and christ has to be born into every consciousness. Unless it happens, one remains unfulfilled, miserable, in agony.\nUnless you come to a state where you completely disappear and only god exists, you will remain in misery. Misery is not caused by something outside you; it is caused because you have not been able to be that which you are meant to be. Misery is not caused by anybody else; misery is an inner turmoil to be that which is your destiny.\nA seed is in misery because the plant wants to sprout. The seed is in agony. It cannot rest how can it rest? If the seed starts resting, there will be no possibility of the tree being born at all. The rest of the seed will be death to the tree. The seed cannot rest; the seed has to go through sufferings. The seed has to be restless, until it finds the right soil where it can be born, lose itself, be in a let-go, and allow that which is hidden inside it to unfold. The seed disappears and the plant is born. You disappear and god is born.\nMan is a seed. And as seed, man is bound to remain in misery... and he should remain in misery – otherwise god will never be born.\nSo the agony is a must – one should not avoid it. One should not take tranquillisers to avoid it. One should not create false consolations to avoid it. As a human being you have to remain in anguish – only that anguish will create the fire in you so that one day you explode... and thence is ecstasy.\nEcstasy simply means that you have come to be that which you were meant to be... you have flowered. Nothing is hidden behind you now – the song has come out. You have burst forth in song!\n[The new sannyasin says: I have read your book about the hundred and twelve methods of Shiva, and I would like to know whether you can suggest a method for me to let my heart growFor three\nyears I have been doing a mantra meditation.]\nIn the morning do the dynamic, in the evening do the mantra. Go on reading ‘The Book of the Secrets’, and if sometimes something attracts you, try it for seven days. If it fits, go on. Many methods can fit, but if it doesn’t fit, forget all about it. And if mantra is fitting you, then you can very easily find which methods will fit you. But these two are enough; even if you don’t do anything, these two will do.\nAnd start helping people for me. In germany, help people to meditate, because there is nothing more creative than meditation. Each art and each creativity can be tremendously enhanced by meditation. If somebody is a painter and he starts meditating, his painting will have a sudden jump, it will become tremendously profound – because whatsoever you paint reflects your mind. If the mind goes deeper, your painting will go deeper. You paint your mind. What else can you paint? You paint yourself.\nSo if something deep happens in you, your painting will immediately start moving in a deeper dimension. Or if you sing, with meditation your song will have a totally different quality to it. It\nwill not be superficial; it will start moving vertically – in depth and in height. If you dance, your dance will be different, because if you meditate you will come to know a dance in which the dancer disappears and only the dance remains. Then even the audience will suddenly feel a new breeze, a new ray of light. The dancer will become a vehicle of the divine.\nSo whatsoever you are teaching, make it a point to add meditation to each effort. Meditation is the greatest source of creativity. It releases tremendous energy, because tensions are less, anxieties are less, so the energy that was involved in tension and anxiety is no more involved there. It is available. You can create better.\nAnd your art will become more objective – what Gurdjieff means by objective. It will become more real. It will not be just a dreamy thing that you are doing not knowing why, that you are doing not knowing what, that you are doing because you feel restless, so you need to do something.\nOnce you become settled, centred, then art is not like an obsession; it is not an occupation. You do it for a clear-cut purpose... it becomes purposive. It has a direction, it has a message to deliver. And when somebody looks at the painting, or listens to the song, or looks at the dance or the sculpture, he will have a glimpse of what you wanted to convey to him.\nMuch of the modern art is very very non-objective, nightmarish in that way. It seems that only troubled people are painting. It seems as if only insane people – who have lost all sense of direction – are painting.\nSo help people to meditate, and that will be the greatest contribution to their creativity.\nSomewhere creativity and meditation have to meet, otherwise both can be dangerous. It has happened in the east. Meditation took a very different route to creativity – it moved away from creativity. It lost all track of creativity. It became escapist.\nIf meditation loses track of creativity, it becomes escapist. One starts renouncing the world – it becomes suicidal. And if creativity is without meditation – as it is happening in the West – then the creativity goes insane. Both are not good alternatives – suicide and insanity. Many great painters, at sometime or other in their life, were put into the mad asylum. Or even if they were not put, they were insane, people tolerated them. Their painting and their work are enough proof that they were not in their senses. They were possessed, as if by some evil force, or by many forces together, and they were torn apart.\nIn the West, creativity has taken a route totally different to meditation; in the east, meditation took a route absolutely negating creativity – both have failed. Both had to fail – and it is good that both have failed. Now a totally new world, where creativity and meditation meet together and go hand in hand, is possible in the future. That will be the greatest synthesis between the east and the west, between the active mind and the passive mind, between male and female, Yin and Yang.\nMeditation is Yin, creativity is Yang. Meditation is passive, creativity is active. Meditation is female, creativity is male. They both have to meet. And when they both meet, something beautiful happens. So work on those lines... help people.\n[A sannyasin who is leaving says: Several times in the past, and for the past few nights, I wake up and just find a sort of consciousness there – no identity, not knowing where I am, who I am... just a very lost feeling. It may last for a number of minutes... I guess I identify that space somewhat with what you speak of as dropping the ego.]\nYes, yes, it is... it is so. You have understood it exactly.\n[The sannyasin continues: But I find it so terrifying. Going back to life now has no meaning because there’s just something that I have to do, and going back is a way of postponing it, and is relatively meaningless. But this huge thing is sort of looming in front of me – something that I find fearful... going mad and.]\nThat too is true. When you start tasting something of the inner, suddenly the outer seems to be meaningless, irrelevant. But I would like you to go and be in the outer and yet remain alert about the inner. I don’t want to create any separation between the outer and the inner.\nThis tendency arises because when you start tasting something of the inner, suddenly you say, ‘What is the point of rushing and doing this and that?’ Now it seems meaningless – the old motivation is gone, the old greed is not there, the old ego is not there, so why?\nBut I would like you to go and do it without any ego, without any motivation – do it just as an actor. And it will help your inner journey more. It will give you the contrast. It will make you more aware rather than less, and it will be helpful to your meditation.\nOne day I will tell you to forget all about the world, but not right now. Right now go into the world, carry whatsoever you are feeling inside.\nAnd there is fear that it may be lost. That fear has to be faced – it will not be lost. Many times you will feel that it is lost – catch hold of it again. That will be a training, a discipline. And that will make you more confident about the inner space that you are becoming aware of.\nMy whole effort is that no separation arises, and that one day you can come to feel that the inner and outer are one. Whether you do something or you don’t do anything – both are good.and there is\nno need to choose. If it happens that something has to be done, you do it. If it happens that nothing has to be done, sit silently. When you sit silently, there is no hankering to do anything. When you do something, there is no hankering to sit silently. Then you have arrived home, then you are at ease, then there is no problem.\nAnd it is frightening too, because whenever you lose the contact of the ego – even for a single moment – you are lost in a vacuum. Of course you don’t know who you are then, because all that you know about yourself is the ego. Once the ego is not functioning – even for a single second – suddenly you are in a chaos; you have lost all track of yourself. It is almost like death, so it is terrifying.\nBut by and by you see that the terrifying is the terrifically beautiful too. By and by you will see that that which was looking like death is the reality of life. It is more alive than what you call lifebut it\nwill take a little time. Gradually you will have to become acquainted with it. It will be coming more\nand more, and seconds will turn into minutes, and minutes will turn into hours, and hours will turn into days – and then you will see that even death is not death.\nDeath, too, is a new life, a beginning of a new life... a beginning of a greater life than you have known before. Nothing dies – nothing can die. In the very nature of things death is impossible. Things only change form. The journey is eternal.\nSomething of very great significance is just by the corner, just around you. It will be terrifying, scary. You have to know it and yet you have to go into it. It will say to you, ‘What is the point of going to the west? What is the point of going to the job – why bother?’ – but still you have to go and do it, otherwise you will be stuck.\nI have seen many sannyasins who have escaped from the world, gone to the himalayas, and they are stuck, because the very situation where challenge is, has been lost. Things grow in a challenge – and challenge is the meaning of the world.\nYou cannot find a better challenge than america. It is maddeningly challenging! And one has to keep alert and silent there. If you can be alert and silent in america, then you have found your himalaya – that is the right place. The marketplace is the right place to meditate. So I suggest you go.\nOne day I will tell you to forget all about it... to now just be here, dance and sing, and let this be your world. But right now, it is worth going. I know the fear, and I know the meaninglessness of it, mm?\n[The sannyasin adds: I did a Gurdjieff group where I studied with one of the Gurdjieff people – should I continue with this?]\nYou continue, mm? It is one of the most beautiful things available. Continue – and it is in tune with me, so there is no conflict. Continue, and convert the Gurdjieff group people, because now Gurdjieff is dead, and then work is just so-so. It cannot be of much depth.\nThese things remain alive only with the master. These things are so fragile. It is almost as if the bush is dead and you have gathered a few roses, and you go on protecting them. They are dead! Memories of good old days – but they are no more alive!\nAnd spiritual work is such a fragile rose that when the master is gone, it is gone. You can carry on a little bit here and there, mm? a few things – words and theories and some techniques – but that is just peripheral. Good! better than not doing anything... and they are good people to associate with. Wherever people gather together for any inner inquiry, it is good to be there... the very milieu is good. So you continue, and you will help them to come to me.\nAll Gurdjieff people have to come sooner or later, because only dead techniques are in their hands, and they too, not in totality... just fragments. But don’t try very directly to convert them – no! Otherwise any type of people become afraid in different ways. You just be there, mm? and by and by just tell them very indirectly – they will be helped.\nKeep this box with you, mm? And at least when you go to meet the Gurdjieff group, keep the box in the pocket, mm? (laughter) Good!\n[A visitor says: I feel I’ve got some problems with negative feelings... Aggressive feelings – which I’m getting especially in this place... Here, especially strong.]\nHere things become strong. Everything that you have been carrying for your whole life will become strong. And that has to be so, so you have to face your problems. In the presence of a master, whatsoever is your problem will bubble up and will come to the surface. The greedy person will become very greedy, the sexual will become very sexual, the aggressive will become very aggressive.\nAnd that is the problem to be solved. In fact, it is one of the oldest techniques – to go to the master and to just be in his presence, and to see what happens to you. Suddenly your chief problem will come up. So aggression is your problem – that can be solved.\nOnce the problem is known, almost fifty percent is solved. The real problem is not to solve a problem, the real problem is to know what it is. The diagnosis is more important than the medicine. The treatment is very easy – once it is diagnosed, then the chemist can supply it; it is not very difficult.\nHow long can you be here?\n[The visitor answers: I think I depart on monday.]\nYou are going on monday? Aggression won’t go that fast. You can go, but aggression won’t go that fast. You will have to come and be here for at least a few weeks. Aggression can go, but it has to be brought out... it has to be vomited.\n[The visitor enquires: What other practical ways can I deal with that?]\nI will not talk to you – you will have to come and be here for a few days. You will not be able to do it alone, no. It can be dangerous. You need a group situation. You have to be provoked first – provoked to your very extreme so you almost go mad – and only then it will explode. If you yourself are trying. you will remain in control. If you do some techniques to bring aggression out, you remain in control. You allow only so far, and then you become afraid. Then you say it is dangerous.\nIt needs a group situation where others can provoke you. And in a moment of unconsciousness, the provocation goes so deep that you suddenly forget yourself and you are simply aggression. That is the moment when you flare up... and it goes! But that has to be done only in a group situation, never otherwise. Alone, and if something goes wrong, there will be nobody to look after you – that’s not right.\nWhenever you can make it possible, come back. At least for six, seven weeks be here, go through a few groups, and it will be solved.\nAggression is one of the simplest problems. There are deeper problems which are more difficult – greed, for example, is more difficult. Aggression is very simple because it is a very unnatural problem. Nobody is naturally aggressive. Aggression is a problem created by the society. Because you have never been allowed to be angry, it has accumulated. It is anger accumulated.\nFrom your very childhood, many things have accumulated. Now the reservoir is too much. If you are allowed anger every day, within a few days the reservoir will be exhausted. It is not a big problem.\n[The visitor answers: I spent two years in primal therapy.]\nIt has not worked. No, it has not worked. Something must have gone wrong. And primal therapy is not a panacea, it works only for a few people. So this is a difficulty: no technique can work on all people. But whenever a technique works on a few people, the originator of the technique thinks that now he has found the panacea. He goes on prescribing it to everybody, and he doesn’t bother about the person. It may not work, because your aggression may not be connected with the primal scream. If it is connected with the primal scream, then it will work, but it may be completely disconnected with it. It may have another source.\nPrimal therapy works only if, when the child was born, he had a trauma. For example, the child wanted to cry, and he was not allowed to cry. A sedative was given, or the mother’s breast was given immediately so he could not cry. The cry has remained... and is still there. If something like that has happened, and that is the root cause of your aggression, primal therapy will help. Then one day when the cry comes, suddenly you will see that everything has disappeared, exploded, gone.\nBut I don’t see that that is the problem. Your anger has gathered day by day. The whole of your life, you have been controlling and gathering. You are a very controlled man.\nAnd that happens to germans. The whole race is very controlled, and the culture is such that children have been brought up to be disciplined and controlled – that is part of their upbringing. You cannot cry easily, you cannot weep easily... tears will be difficult. It will not look masculine; it will look feminine. Mm? it won’t appeal to your ego. Day by day, down the years you have accumulated. A primal scream won’t help. You will need a totally different methodology. But you can come, whenever.\n... If you want to stay, then I will plan for you. Then a few groups I will give you... if you want to stay.\nFirst you have to join the african dance and karate; these are the two basic things. Then you have to go through rolfing. Simultaneously you can do karate, african dance, rolfing. These are the beginning things. They will bring your body to a point where things will start happening – this will be the physical part. One has to go slowly. Then one group, tathata – from the twentieth to the twenty-second of january. The second will be encounter, and the third will be hypnotherapy. Book for these three groups – if you want to stay. These three things will do. Mm? Good!\n[A sannyasin says: I feel that I don’t accept my negative feelings and that I’m fighting with them all the time.]\nMm mm. If you enjoy something.But this is not going to help. You have to accept the negative too.\nWhen you walk in the sun, you have to accept your shadow too. If you don’t accept your shadow and you start fighting with it, you will never reach anywhere – you will be fighting with the shadow. Whenever you move, the shadow will be there, so you jump again on the shadowand a shadow\nis a shadow.\nEach positive has its shadow – the negative. If you want to love people, the shadow will be there – the shadow will be of hate. If you really want to destroy hate, you will have to destroy love too. And that will not be a game, it will not be worthwhile. If you want to destroy the shadow, you will have to run inside and close your room, and hide there – no sun, no shadow. But what is the point of losing the sunshine? You will be losing life itself.\nBut I can understand where the problem comes from. We have been brought up, we have been conditioned in such a way, that we cannot think that the negative belongs to us. That’s why we always try to make the other responsible for the negative. If you become angry, you simply say ‘The other was behaving in such a way – that’s why I’m angry.’ You don’t take the responsibility; you make the other responsible. And by making the others responsible, you are losing your freedom. Now you will never be free, because what can you do? If the other creates anger, he can create. And there are millions of others – how will you manage?\nBut if you accept your anger and you don’t throw the responsibility on anybody else... you say, ‘Yes, this is part of life – anger is in me,’ you become free. Now if you want to be angry, you can be angry; if you don’t want to be angry, nobody can make you angry. This is freedom, this is independence. Now you are no more a mechanical thing, nobody can push your button. But the first thing is to accept it – that it is yours. Just as the right hand is yours, the left is yours too.\nOnce you accept, you can find a way to use the left also. Then there can be a positive use of the negativity itself. And that is the whole science of religion: how to change the poisonous into the sweet, how to change the bitter into honey, how to make the poison function as nectar. That is the whole inner alchemy – to transform the baser metal into gold.\nIt is there, but it can be transformed into gold. Hate, through deep acceptance, can be transformed into love. It is raw love, nothing else. It is raw energy; defined, it becomes love. Anger can become compassion – anger is raw compassion. Don’t throw it – it is a diamond! Cut it, polish it, and it can become a kohinoor.\nSo the negative has nothing wrong in it. It still has to be worked on, refined, transformed. It has to go through a few processes, that’s all. It is crude. Once refined, it will become very very valuable. But you can transform anything only if you accept it. If you deny it from the very beginning, how can you transform it? And that’s what you are doing.\nStart working, and totally accept yourself there. Then the work will become your meditation. Never reject. If you don’t reject, you will not throw on anybody else, you will absorb it.\nWhat particular negative emotion comes to you?\n[She answers: Jealousy of other people... ambition, and envy also. It is difficult to accept those things when I want to be good.]\nMm mm. I declare you good! (laughter) Why bother? I can give you a written certificate! (she laughs) There is no need to become good – one is simply good. Everybody is good. We bring goodness with our birth; it is born in us... nothing to be worried about. You are good with all your jealousies, possessiveness, ambition – still you are good. A rose is a rose even if there are so many thorns – that makes no difference. You start accepting yourself, mm?

And christ is not a person. When the
personality disappears, when the ego disappears, when the sense of ‘I’
disappears, christ is born.</p><p><br></p><p>Every time somebody reaches into his innermost core, christ is born
again. It is not a historical thing that happened once and then stopped.
Krishna is also a Christ and Buddha too.</p><p><br></p><p>Christ is a state. It has nothing to do with Jesus in particular –
Jesus is one of the Christs. There have been many before him, there have
been many after, and there will continue to be many more. So think of
christ as a state – the state of no-mind, the state when thinking stops
and you are simply aware. Not aware of something in particular, but
simply aware. Not aware of any object... your awareness is not focused
on anything. You cannot say of what you are aware; you can simply say,
‘I am aware.’ That is the state of christ.</p><p>And it is ugly to become a Christian, it is ugly to become a Hindu,
ugly to become a Mohammedan – but it is beautiful to become a Christ, to
become a Mohammed, to become a Krishna. These are states. They arc not
confined to persons, territories, geography, climate, creed; they are
not confined to anything.</p><p><br></p><p>That is the entry of the beyond within you: when suddenly your drop
disappears and the ocean is there... infinite... when the unbounded has
descended in you.</p><p><br></p><p>When you cannot separate yourself from existence, when the marriage
has happened, when you are wed to existence, that is the state of being
a christ.</p><p><br></p><p>Christo prem will mean the love for the state of no-mind; the search
for the state of no-mind.</p><p><br></p><p>So this night, let christ be born to you; let the drama be enacted
again. It has to be enacted in every consciousness. Every consciousness
is a stage, and christ has to be born into every consciousness. Unless
it happens, one remains unfulfilled, miserable, in agony.</p><p><br></p><p>Unless you come to a state where you completely disappear and only
god exists, you will remain in misery. Misery is not caused by something
outside you; it is caused because you have not been able to be that
which you are meant to be. Misery is not caused by anybody else; misery
is an inner turmoil to be that which is your destiny.</p><p><br></p><p>A seed is in misery because the plant wants to sprout. The seed is in
agony. It cannot rest how can it rest? If the seed starts resting, there
will be no possibility of the tree being born at all. The rest of the
seed will be death to the tree. The seed cannot rest; the seed has to go
through sufferings. The seed has to be restless, until it finds the
right soil where it can be born, lose itself, be in a let-go, and allow
that which is hidden inside it to unfold. The seed disappears and the
plant is born. You disappear and god is born.</p><p><br></p><p>Man is a seed. And as seed, man is bound to remain in misery... and
he should remain in misery – otherwise god will never be born.</p><p><br></p><p>So the agony is a must – one should not avoid it. One should not take
tranquillisers to avoid it. One should not create false consolations to
avoid it. As a human being you have to remain in anguish – only that
anguish will create the fire in you so that one day you explode... and
thence is ecstasy.</p><p><br></p><p>Ecstasy simply means that you have come to be that which you were
meant to be... you have flowered. Nothing is hidden behind you now – the
song has come out. You have burst forth in song!</p><p><br></p><p>[The new sannyasin says: I have read your book about the hundred and
twelve methods of Shiva, and I would like to know whether you can
suggest a method for me to let my heart grow<span class=s4></span>For
three</p><p>years I have been doing a mantra meditation.]</p><p><br></p><p>In the morning do the dynamic, in the evening do the mantra. Go on
reading ‘The Book of the Secrets’, and if sometimes something attracts
you, try it for seven days. If it fits, go on. Many methods can fit, but
if it doesn’t fit, forget all about it. And if mantra is fitting you,
then you can very easily find which methods will fit you. But these two
are enough; even if you don’t do anything, these two will do.</p><p><br></p><p>And start helping people for me. In germany, help people to meditate,
because there is nothing more creative than meditation. Each art and
each creativity can be tremendously enhanced by meditation. If somebody
is a painter and he starts meditating, his painting will have a sudden
jump, it will become tremendously profound – because whatsoever you
paint reflects your mind. If the mind goes deeper, your painting will go
deeper. You paint your mind. What else can you paint? You paint
yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>So if something deep happens in you, your painting will immediately
start moving in a deeper dimension. Or if you sing, with meditation your
song will have a totally different quality to it. It</p><p><br></p><p>will not be superficial; it will start moving vertically – in depth
and in height. If you dance, your dance will be different, because if
you meditate you will come to know a dance in which the dancer
disappears and only the dance remains. Then even the audience will
suddenly feel a new breeze, a new ray of light. The dancer will become a
vehicle of the divine.</p><p><br></p><p>So whatsoever you are teaching, make it a point to add meditation to
each effort. Meditation is the greatest source of creativity. It
releases tremendous energy, because tensions are less, anxieties are
less, so the energy that was involved in tension and anxiety is no more
involved there. It is available. You can create better.</p><p><br></p><p>And your art will become more objective – what Gurdjieff means by
objective. It will become more real. It will not be just a dreamy thing
that you are doing not knowing why, that you are doing not knowing what,
that you are doing because you feel restless, so you need to do
something.</p><p><br></p><p>Once you become settled, centred, then art is not like an obsession;
it is not an occupation. You do it for a clear-cut purpose... it becomes
purposive. It has a direction, it has a message to deliver. And when
somebody looks at the painting, or listens to the song, or looks at the
dance or the sculpture, he will have a glimpse of what you wanted to
convey to him.</p><p><br></p><p>Much of the modern art is very very non-objective, nightmarish in
that way. It seems that only troubled people are painting. It seems as
if only insane people – who have lost all sense of direction – are
painting.</p><p><br></p><p>So help people to meditate, and that will be the greatest
contribution to their creativity.</p><p><br></p><p>Somewhere creativity and meditation have to meet, otherwise both can
be dangerous. It has happened in the east. Meditation took a very
different route to creativity – it moved away from creativity. It lost
all track of creativity. It became escapist.</p><p><br></p><p>If meditation loses track of creativity, it becomes escapist. One
starts renouncing the world – it becomes suicidal. And if creativity is
without meditation – as it is happening in the West – then the
creativity goes insane. Both are not good alternatives – suicide and
insanity. Many great painters, at sometime or other in their life, were
put into the mad asylum. Or even if they were not put, they were insane,
people tolerated them. Their painting and their work are enough proof
that they were not in their senses. They were possessed, as if by some
evil force, or by many forces together, and they were torn apart.</p><p><br></p><p>In the West, creativity has taken a route totally different to
meditation; in the east, meditation took a route absolutely negating
creativity – both have failed. Both had to fail – and it is good that
both have failed. Now a totally new world, where creativity and
meditation meet together and go hand in hand, is possible in the future.
That will be the greatest synthesis between the east and the west,
between the active mind and the passive mind, between male and female,
Yin and Yang.</p><p><br></p><p>Meditation is Yin, creativity is Yang. Meditation is passive,
creativity is active. Meditation is female, creativity is male. They
both have to meet. And when they both meet, something beautiful happens.
So work on those lines... help people.</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin who is leaving says: Several times in the past, and for
the past few nights, I wake up and just find a sort of consciousness
there – no identity, not knowing where I am, who I am... just a very
lost feeling. It may last for a number of minutes... I guess I identify
that space somewhat with what you speak of as dropping the ego.]</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, yes, it is... it is so. You have understood it exactly.</p><p><br></p><p>[The sannyasin continues: But I find it so terrifying. Going back to
life now has no meaning because there’s just something that I have to
do, and going back is a way of postponing it, and is relatively
meaningless. But this huge thing is sort of looming in front of me –
something that I find fearful... going mad and.<span class=s4></span>]</p><p><br></p><p>That too is true. When you start tasting something of the inner,
suddenly the outer seems to be meaningless, irrelevant. But I would like
you to go and be in the outer and yet remain alert about the inner. I
don’t want to create any separation between the outer and the inner.</p><p><br></p><p>This tendency arises because when you start tasting something of the
inner, suddenly you say, ‘What is the point of rushing and doing this
and that?’ Now it seems meaningless – the old motivation is gone, the
old greed is not there, the old ego is not there, so why?</p><p><br></p><p>But I would like you to go and do it without any ego, without any
motivation – do it just as an actor. And it will help your inner journey
more. It will give you the contrast. It will make you more aware rather
than less, and it will be helpful to your meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>One day I will tell you to forget all about the world, but not right
now. Right now go into the world, carry whatsoever you are feeling
inside.</p><p><br></p><p>And there is fear that it may be lost. That fear has to be faced – it
will not be lost. Many times you will feel that it is lost – catch hold
of it again. That will be a training, a discipline. And that will make
you more confident about the inner space that you are becoming aware
of.</p><p><br></p><p>My whole effort is that no separation arises, and that one day you
can come to feel that the inner and outer are one. Whether you do
something or you don’t do anything – both are good.<span class=s4></span>and there is</p><p>no need to choose. If it happens that something has to be done, you
do it. If it happens that nothing has to be done, sit silently. When you
sit silently, there is no hankering to do anything. When you do
something, there is no hankering to sit silently. Then you have arrived
home, then you are at ease, then there is no problem.</p><p><br></p><p>And it is frightening too, because whenever you lose the contact of
the ego – even for a single moment – you are lost in a vacuum. Of course
you don’t know who you are then, because all that you know about
yourself is the ego. Once the ego is not functioning – even for a single
second – suddenly you are in a chaos; you have lost all track of
yourself. It is almost like death, so it is terrifying.</p><p><br></p><p>But by and by you see that the terrifying is the terrifically
beautiful too. By and by you will see that that which was looking like
death is the reality of life. It is more alive than what you call
life<span class=s4></span>but it</p><p>will take a little time. Gradually you will have to become acquainted
with it. It will be coming more</p><p><br></p><p>and more, and seconds will turn into minutes, and minutes will turn
into hours, and hours will turn into days – and then you will see that
even death is not death.</p><p><br></p><p>Death, too, is a new life, a beginning of a new life... a beginning
of a greater life than you have known before. Nothing dies – nothing can
die. In the very nature of things death is impossible. Things only
change form. The journey is eternal.</p><p><br></p><p>Something of very great significance is just by the corner, just
around you. It will be terrifying, scary. You have to know it and yet
you have to go into it. It will say to you, ‘What is the point of going
to the west? What is the point of going to the job – why bother?’ – but
still you have to go and do it, otherwise you will be stuck.</p><p><br></p><p>I have seen many sannyasins who have escaped from the world, gone to
the himalayas, and they are stuck, because the very situation where
challenge is, has been lost. Things grow in a challenge – and challenge
is the meaning of the world.</p><p><br></p><p>You cannot find a better challenge than america. It is maddeningly
challenging! And one has to keep alert and silent there. If you can be
alert and silent in america, then you have found your himalaya – that is
the right place. The marketplace is the right place to meditate. So I
suggest you go.</p><p><br></p><p>One day I will tell you to forget all about it... to now just be
here, dance and sing, and let this be your world. But right now, it is
worth going. I know the fear, and I know the meaninglessness of it,
mm?</p><p><br></p><p>[The sannyasin adds: I did a Gurdjieff group where I studied with one
of the Gurdjieff people – should I continue with this?]</p><p><br></p><p>You continue, mm? It is one of the most beautiful things available.
Continue – and it is in tune with me, so there is no conflict. Continue,
and convert the Gurdjieff group people, because now Gurdjieff is dead,
and then work is just so-so. It cannot be of much depth.</p><p><br></p><p>These things remain alive only with the master. These things are so
fragile. It is almost as if the bush is dead and you have gathered a few
roses, and you go on protecting them. They are dead! Memories of good
old days – but they are no more alive!</p><p><br></p><p>And spiritual work is such a fragile rose that when the master is
gone, it is gone. You can carry on a little bit here and there, mm? a
few things – words and theories and some techniques – but that is just
peripheral. Good! better than not doing anything... and they are good
people to associate with. Wherever people gather together for any inner
inquiry, it is good to be there... the very milieu is good. So you
continue, and you will help them to come to me.</p><p><br></p><p>All Gurdjieff people have to come sooner or later, because only dead
techniques are in their hands, and they too, not in totality... just
fragments. But don’t try very directly to convert them – no! Otherwise
any type of people become afraid in different ways. You just be there,
mm? and by and by just tell them very indirectly – they will be
helped.</p><p><br></p><p>Keep this box with you, mm? And at least when you go to meet the
Gurdjieff group, keep the box in the pocket, mm? (laughter) Good!</p><p><br></p><p>[A visitor says: I feel I’ve got some problems with negative
feelings... Aggressive feelings – which I’m getting especially in this
place... Here, especially strong.]</p><p><br></p><p>Here things become strong. Everything that you have been carrying for
your whole life will become strong. And that has to be so, so you have
to face your problems. In the presence of a master, whatsoever is your
problem will bubble up and will come to the surface. The greedy person
will become very greedy, the sexual will become very sexual, the
aggressive will become very aggressive.</p><p><br></p><p>And that is the problem to be solved. In fact, it is one of the
oldest techniques – to go to the master and to just be in his presence,
and to see what happens to you. Suddenly your chief problem will come
up. So aggression is your problem – that can be solved.</p><p><br></p><p>Once the problem is known, almost fifty percent is solved. The real
problem is not to solve a problem, the real problem is to know what it
is. The diagnosis is more important than the medicine. The treatment is
very easy – once it is diagnosed, then the chemist can supply it; it is
not very difficult.</p><p><br></p><p>How long can you be here?</p><p><br></p><p>[The visitor answers: I think I depart on monday.]</p><p><br></p><p>You are going on monday? Aggression won’t go that fast. You can go,
but aggression won’t go that fast. You will have to come and be here for
at least a few weeks. Aggression can go, but it has to be brought out...
it has to be vomited.</p><p><br></p><p>[The visitor enquires: What other practical ways can I deal with
that?]</p><p><br></p><p>I will not talk to you – you will have to come and be here for a few
days. You will not be able to do it alone, no. It can be dangerous. You
need a group situation. You have to be provoked first – provoked to your
very extreme so you almost go mad – and only then it will explode. If
you yourself are trying. you will remain in control. If you do some
techniques to bring aggression out, you remain in control. You allow
only so far, and then you become afraid. Then you say it is
dangerous.</p><p><br></p><p>It needs a group situation where others can provoke you. And in a
moment of unconsciousness, the provocation goes so deep that you
suddenly forget yourself and you are simply aggression. That is the
moment when you flare up... and it goes! But that has to be done only in
a group situation, never otherwise. Alone, and if something goes wrong,
there will be nobody to look after you – that’s not right.</p><p><br></p><p>Whenever you can make it possible, come back. At least for six, seven
weeks be here, go through a few groups, and it will be solved.</p><p><br></p><p>Aggression is one of the simplest problems. There are deeper problems
which are more difficult – greed, for example, is more difficult.
Aggression is very simple because it is a very unnatural problem. Nobody
is naturally aggressive. Aggression is a problem created by the society.
Because you have never been allowed to be angry, it has accumulated. It
is anger accumulated.</p><p><br></p><p>From your very childhood, many things have accumulated. Now the
reservoir is too much. If you are allowed anger every day, within a few
days the reservoir will be exhausted. It is not a big problem.</p><p><br></p><p>[The visitor answers: I spent two years in primal therapy.]</p><p><br></p><p>It has not worked. No, it has not worked. Something must have gone
wrong. And primal therapy is not a panacea, it works only for a few
people. So this is a difficulty: no technique can work on all people.
But whenever a technique works on a few people, the originator of the
technique thinks that now he has found the panacea. He goes on
prescribing it to everybody, and he doesn’t bother about the person. It
may not work, because your aggression may not be connected with the
primal scream. If it is connected with the primal scream, then it will
work, but it may be completely disconnected with it. It may have another
source.</p><p><br></p><p>Primal therapy works only if, when the child was born, he had a
trauma. For example, the child wanted to cry, and he was not allowed to
cry. A sedative was given, or the mother’s breast was given immediately
so he could not cry. The cry has remained... and is still there. If
something like that has happened, and that is the root cause of your
aggression, primal therapy will help. Then one day when the cry comes,
suddenly you will see that everything has disappeared, exploded,
gone.</p><p><br></p><p>But I don’t see that that is the problem. Your anger has gathered day
by day. The whole of your life, you have been controlling and gathering.
You are a very controlled man.</p><p><br></p><p>And that happens to germans. The whole race is very controlled, and
the culture is such that children have been brought up to be disciplined
and controlled – that is part of their upbringing. You cannot cry
easily, you cannot weep easily... tears will be difficult. It will not
look masculine; it will look feminine. Mm? it won’t appeal to your ego.
Day by day, down the years you have accumulated. A primal scream won’t
help. You will need a totally different methodology. But you can come,
whenever.</p><p><br></p><p>... If you want to stay, then I will plan for you. Then a few groups
I will give you... if you want to stay.</p><p><br></p><p>First you have to join the african dance and karate; these are the
two basic things. Then you have to go through rolfing. Simultaneously
you can do karate, african dance, rolfing. These are the beginning
things. They will bring your body to a point where things will start
happening – this will be the physical part. One has to go slowly. Then
one group, tathata – from the twentieth to the twenty-second of january.
The second will be encounter, and the third will be hypnotherapy. Book
for these three groups – if you want to stay. These three things will
do. Mm? Good!</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin says: I feel that I don’t accept my negative feelings
and that I’m fighting with them all the time.]</p><p><br></p><p>Mm mm. If you enjoy something.<span class=s4></span>But this is not
going to help. You have to accept the negative too.</p><p>When you walk in the sun, you have to accept your shadow too. If you
don’t accept your shadow and you start fighting with it, you will never
reach anywhere – you will be fighting with the shadow. Whenever you
move, the shadow will be there, so you jump again on the shadow<span class=s4></span>and a shadow</p><p>is a shadow.</p><p><br></p><p>Each positive has its shadow – the negative. If you want to love
people, the shadow will be there – the shadow will be of hate. If you
really want to destroy hate, you will have to destroy love too. And that
will not be a game, it will not be worthwhile. If you want to destroy
the shadow, you will have to run inside and close your room, and hide
there – no sun, no shadow. But what is the point of losing the sunshine?
You will be losing life itself.</p><p><br></p><p>But I can understand where the problem comes from. We have been
brought up, we have been conditioned in such a way, that we cannot think
that the negative belongs to us. That’s why we always try to make the
other responsible for the negative. If you become angry, you simply say
‘The other was behaving in such a way – that’s why I’m angry.’ You don’t
take the responsibility; you make the other responsible. And by making
the others responsible, you are losing your freedom. Now you will never
be free, because what can you do? If the other creates anger, he can
create. And there are millions of others – how will you manage?</p><p><br></p><p>But if you accept your anger and you don’t throw the responsibility
on anybody else... you say, ‘Yes, this is part of life – anger is in
me,’ you become free. Now if you want to be angry, you can be angry; if
you don’t want to be angry, nobody can make you angry. This is freedom,
this is independence. Now you are no more a mechanical thing, nobody can
push your button. But the first thing is to accept it – that it is
yours. Just as the right hand is yours, the left is yours too.</p><p><br></p><p>Once you accept, you can find a way to use the left also. Then there
can be a positive use of the negativity itself. And that is the whole
science of religion: how to change the poisonous into the sweet, how to
change the bitter into honey, how to make the poison function as nectar.
That is the whole inner alchemy – to transform the baser metal into
gold.</p><p><br></p><p>It is there, but it can be transformed into gold. Hate, through deep
acceptance, can be transformed into love. It is raw love, nothing else.
It is raw energy; defined, it becomes love. Anger can become compassion
– anger is raw compassion. Don’t throw it – it is a diamond! Cut it,
polish it, and it can become a kohinoor.</p><p><br></p><p>So the negative has nothing wrong in it. It still has to be worked
on, refined, transformed. It has to go through a few processes, that’s
all. It is crude. Once refined, it will become very very valuable. But
you can transform anything only if you accept it. If you deny it from
the very beginning, how can you transform it? And that’s what you are

become your meditation. Never reject. If you don’t reject, you will not
throw on anybody else, you will absorb it.</p><p><br></p><p>What particular negative emotion comes to you?</p><p><br></p><p>[She answers: Jealousy of other people... ambition, and envy also. It
is difficult to accept those things when I want to be good.]</p><p><br></p><p>Mm mm. I declare you good! (laughter) Why bother? I can give you a

is born in us... nothing to be worried about. You are good with all your
jealousies, possessiveness, ambition – still you are good. A rose is a
rose even if there are so many thorns – that makes no difference. You
start accepting yourself, mm? Soon things will change. Good!</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part18>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

And remember this – that bliss is never knowledgeable, and a man of knowledge is never blissful. Only innocent people can be blissful, only children can be blissful. Those who don’t know, only they can be blissful. The more you know, the less is the possibility of being blissful.\nThat is the meaning of the biblical story that adam was turned out of the garden of eden – because he ate the fruit of the tree of knowledge; he became knowledgeable, he became a knower. He lost his innocence. He was no more a child... the ego entered. The ego always enters through knowledge. Knowledge is a very subtle possession, and knowledge separates you from existence.\nSo if you can understand this and keep aware of it, don’t accumulate knowledge. And whenever you see that you have accumulated something, renounce it! There is no need to renounce anything if you can renounce knowledge. And that is the irony: people renounce everything, but they never renounce knowledge.\nRemain ignorant and innocent and you will again enter the garden of eden. Nobody can bar your way, and the doors are not closed to you.\nThe biblical story is really of tremendous import. There are thousands of parables, but nothing to compare with it. It has great insight!\nAdam is not thrown out of heaven because he sinned – that’s what Christians go on saying. No. He has not been thrown out of heaven because he disobeyed; no – that too is not the true explanation. He became knowledgable, he was no more innocent... he became corrupted. Knowledge corrupts.\nSo if you can avoid knowledge, you will fall into deep peace and silence, and bliss.\nThe word ‘abodha’ has both the meanings: it can mean innocent... it can mean ignorant.\nIgnorance is innocent, and innocence is ignorant. They are both two sides of the same coin, adverse and reverse. They are not separate. That’s why jesus goes on insisting: ‘Unless you become like children, you will not enter the kingdom of god.’ And how can one become like a child? One becomes like a child when one renounces knowledge.\nIn fact there is not much trouble in renouncing knowledge, because it is all bogus. In the very nature of things, knowledge is not possible. You cannot know anything. Ignorance is very fundamental, ignorance is eternal – it cannot be broken. All knowledge is on the surface, just go a little deeper and you will find it disappears. You say you know your wife, you know your girlfriend – what do you know? You say you know yourself – what do you know?\nWatch carefully each item that you claim you know, and sooner or later you will understand that you don’t know. Existence is not available to knowledge. It is closed... adam has been thrown out. It is closed for knowledge. It is available for love but it is closed for knowledge. Love is innocent.\nSo there is a way of knowing which is more like loving than knowing. And there are two ways of knowledge: One, the way of knowledge, and another, the way of innocence, the way of love.\nWhen you love a person, you know, and yet you cannot claim knowledge. You know in a subtle way, yet the very claim that you know will be wrong – you cannot claim it. The object of your love remains mysterious – known, yet mysterious. And the whole existence is your object of love.\nSannyas is falling in love with existence.\nThis is my message for you – continuously go on dropping knowledge, and remain innocent. Then you will be able to undo what adam has done.\nEach man has to undo it – that’s what the biblical story says: that each man suffers because adam committed something wrong... because each man is an adam again. Each man has lived in the garden of eden in his childhood. It is not an historical story; it is a psychological story. Each child is born in that parable again: lives in innocence, enjoys blissfully all that is available, then one day suddenly loses that innocence – becomes corrupt, becomes knowledgable.\nThe society is the snake, the school is the snake, the college and the university is the snake. The snake was the first scholar of the world.\nChange to orange – become mad! (laughter)\n[The new sannyasin, dressed in orange trousers and brown shirt, says: I’m half orange!]\nMm? Only half won’t do. A half-mad man is not mad, and a half-mad man is always in trouble. Either be fully sane or fully insane, mm? (laughter) Good!\n[A sannyasin who is returning to the west says: I feel very mixed up because I feel, in a way, more lost than I was before I came. But it seems more exciting.]\nThat is true.… In fact, all certainty is false, and only a mediocre mind remains certain. When intelligence starts growing, you become mixed, because the old certainty is no more. In fact you become very hesitant.\nHesitation is the quality of intelligence. Fools are very certain. You cannot confuse an idiot, can you? It is impossible to confuse an idiot, an imbecile. And a greatly intelligent person is always confused, because life is so vast – how to figure it out? Life is so complex and so tremendously huge – how can you figure it out? Hence the confusion, hence the mixedness. It is a good quality, a good indication.\nLao tzu says in his tao te ching, ‘Everybody seems to be certain – only I am confused. Everybody seems to be confident – only I am hesitant.’ But that is the quality of intelligenceAnd that’s what\nhas happened.\nI have taken much ground away from beneath you. Still there is some ground so you are mixed up. Sooner or later that too will disappear, then you will be in the abyss. And there is no bottom to it, so one goes on falling and falling and falling. Then one stops clinging – clinging creates blocks. One becomes free. A freedom is knocking on your door – hence you are confused.\nIt is as if you have lived in a prison for many years, then suddenly the doors are open and you are told to leave. You hesitate at the gate. For your whole life you have lived in a certain pattern, every-thing was settled, and you were not even responsible for it – somebody else, the gaoler, was responsible. You were not even to plan it. You were living a life of complete non-worry.\nIn the morning, when the bell rang, you had to get up, start working. When another bell rang, you had to go to take your food; another bell and you had to go to sleep. Things were just moving smoothly. No worry for tomorrow of where you were going to get your bread and butter. No worry in the night that robbers might come and rob you. There was no problem at all.\nNow suddenly the doors open, and the gaoler says, ‘Good-bye. You are free!’ – you hesitate. You feel very confused about where to go. You don’t know where your home is. You become accus- tomed by and by to this gaol and it has become your home. Now again your address is lost. You are in an identity crisis. That’s what Erick Erickson calls ‘the identity crisis’. Hence the confusion.\nI create the identity crisis. I take away your old name. I take away your old way of dressing, old colours, your clothes, your style – and suddenly I push you into something very unknown. When you are here it is not so difficult. When you go back to the west, you will feel it more. But it is good to go and to experience it and to feel its total penetration.\nThe confusion is natural, the chaos is natural, because you are becoming freer. The settled groove is not more there; you are no more like a tram running on a track. I have given you freedom. Now you can go in all directions – hence the confusion about where to go. The old style and the old thinking won’t help. You cannot depend on the past, and you don’t know anything of the future. You tremblebut that’s how it should be.\nThe new leaf coming on the tree trembles. So delicate, and it is going to face such a harsh world. You are just like a new leaf, and you will be going to the west and facing a very harsh world... but I send you! Feel the harsh world – that will give you spine, that will give steel to your soul. It will make you stronger. It will give you integration.\nSo this is my deliberate effort – to send sannyasins back, call them again; send them back, call them again, so by and by east and west loses meaning for them... it becomes one world.\nFor three, four months you will be here; then for eight months you will be there, then again a few months here, again thereBy and by the whole world will become your home. You will neither\nbelong to east nor to west. And you will become for the first time, human.a citizen of the earth.\nIt is arduous, and you will have to sacrifice many things – but it is worth it. Hence you feel the excitement too – it is very exciting! Your eyes are not able to understand what wonder is.\nI have made you again a child, and I have given you a name, unmada – it means mad. I have not only given you back your childhood – I have given something plus. I have given you madness too. That is the only way to be sane in this insane world.\nIf you are too sane you will become part of this dead world, this rotten society, this rotten humanity. You have to be a little mad to get out of the rut.\nGo hesitating, go mixed, go a little confused, but go full of excitement. And whenever you feel tired, exhausted, and the world is too much with you, come back.\nI’m coming with you! I’m all for my mad people!\nYou can have as much confusion as you want – I will be your clarity! Good!\nArchana: It means prayer. It is one of the most beautiful names possible. Remind me again about it, mm? For a few days be here and you will start feeling what prayer isBecause in the christian\ncountries, prayer is almost lost, and the formal prayer is thought to be the prayer – it is not the prayer. Prayer has nothing to say – it is more of silence.\nPrayer is not to ask anything from god – rather it is to give. Prayer is an offering of your being.\nPrayer is losing yourself in the divine.\nPrayer is not any verbal communication with god. Rather than saying or talking, it is more like listening. If god speaks, you are ready to listen.\nSo each morning when I am speaking, listen as silently as possible and you will come to know what prayer is – and then you will know the meaning of your name. Mm? It is silent listening, silent communication, silent communion. When your mind is completely dropped and your heart throbs with new life and a song is born in your heart – that is prayer.\nIt will happen! When I give a name, I mean something.It is going to happen – you will grow into\nprayer.\n[A sannyasin says: I have decided to stay For a whileNice feelings are coming.]\nMm, they will come. I was waiting – once the negativity has left, nice feelings will come. They always come after the negativity has been gone through. And my observation is that if somebody is, from the very beginning, positive, his positivity never goes that deep. If somebody comes here and falls into a negative mood, then it is only a question of time. Once he comes out of the negative, the pendulum will swing to the other extreme and he will become tremendously positive. And that makes things total – the negative and the positive.\nIf you are simply positive towards me, then the positivity will miss something in it – it will be just sweet. It needs to be bitter too. And when the negativity and positivity are also there, then you are really in a tremendous love affair – then the love-hate both are there. Then you want to go away, and you cannot. You go two feet, and then you come back four feet. Then it is really beautiful.\n[Another sannyasin says: I feel very good. I’m so much more relaxed, and.I feel I’d like to do\nsomething so the feeling continues. I’ve never really let myself enjoy.]\nMm. So after the camp you join the sufi dancing – that will help you and relax your body.\nThere are very few people who ever allow any happiness to themselves, so then they are miserable. They go on crying and weeping, ‘Why are we miserable?’ – and they never allow any happiness. If happiness comes, they will close their doors; they are afraid of happiness.\nAnd there is a rhythm, because whenever you are in a deep joy, you are lost – you cannot control it; it is bigger than you. We have been taught from the very beginning to control everything. You can control misery – it is smaller than you. You can control anguish – it is smaller than you. You cannot control ecstasy – it is too big, too vast, huge, enormous; you are completely lost in it. It is oceanic, and you become a small tiny wave.\nThis havoc happens because the idea has been implanted deeply into you that everything has to be controlled; to remain in control. I teach uncontrol. I say to be crazy, not to be worried about control. God is enough to control it; you need not control. And the whole existence is so beautifully controlled without any controller.\nOne who looks after the whole will look after you too. And if the whole is going so smoothly, why be worried? Trust! But we bring in our tiny ego and we start controlling and we want to manage our lives. Of course we manage, and that management is nothing but the way to misery – the sure way to misery.\nThat’s why people have lost all capacity to be loose, to relax, to delight, to celebrate, to dance. People are no more orgasmic – and a real authentic person has to be orgasmic. Every fibre of your body and your being should be throbbing with joy. But it is huge, and you will be lost in itnobody\nknows what will happen! There is no need to know – whatsoever happens is good.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2543","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/blessed_are_the_ignorant/part10/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/blessed_are_the_ignorant/>Blessed Are the Ignorant</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">10 Only the Innocent can be Blissful</h1><div class=post-meta>12 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2543 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Blessed_Are_the_Ignorant/part10.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part9>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

the doors are open and you are told to leave. You hesitate at the gate.
For your whole life you have lived in a certain pattern, every-thing was
settled, and you were not even responsible for it – somebody else, the
gaoler, was responsible. You were not even to plan it. You were living a
life of complete non-worry.</p><p><br></p><p>In the morning, when the bell rang, you had to get up, start working.
When another bell rang, you had to go to take your food; another bell
and you had to go to sleep. Things were just moving smoothly. No worry
for tomorrow of where you were going to get your bread and butter. No
worry in the night that robbers might come and rob you. There was no
problem at all.</p><p><br></p><p>Now suddenly the doors open, and the gaoler says, ‘Good-bye. You are
free!’ – you hesitate. You feel very confused about where to go. You
don’t know where your home is. You become accus- tomed by and by to this
gaol and it has become your home. Now again your address is lost. You
are in an identity crisis. That’s what Erick Erickson calls ‘the
identity crisis’. Hence the confusion.</p><p><br></p><p>I create the identity crisis. I take away your old name. I take away
your old way of dressing, old colours, your clothes, your style – and
suddenly I push you into something very unknown. When you are here it is
not so difficult. When you go back to the west, you will feel it more.
But it is good to go and to experience it and to feel its total
penetration.</p><p><br></p><p>The confusion is natural, the chaos is natural, because you are
becoming freer. The settled groove is not more there; you are no more
like a tram running on a track. I have given you freedom. Now you can go
in all directions – hence the confusion about where to go. The old style
and the old thinking won’t help. You cannot depend on the past, and you
don’t know anything of the future. You tremble<span class=s4></span>but that’s how it should be.</p><p><br></p><p>The new leaf coming on the tree trembles. So delicate, and it is
going to face such a harsh world. You are just like a new leaf, and you
will be going to the west and facing a very harsh world... but I send
you! Feel the harsh world – that will give you spine, that will give
steel to your soul. It will make you stronger. It will give you
integration.</p><p><br></p><p>So this is my deliberate effort – to send sannyasins back, call them
again; send them back, call them again, so by and by east and west loses
meaning for them... it becomes one world.</p><p><br></p><p>For three, four months you will be here; then for eight months you
will be there, then again a few months here, again there<span class=s4></span>By and by the whole world will become your home. You
will neither</p><p>belong to east nor to west. And you will become for the first time,
human.<span class=s4></span>a citizen of the earth.</p><p><br></p><p>It is arduous, and you will have to sacrifice many things – but it is
worth it. Hence you feel the excitement too – it is very exciting! Your
eyes are not able to understand what wonder is.</p><p><br></p><p>I have made you again a child, and I have given you a name, unmada –
it means mad. I have not only given you back your childhood – I have
given something plus. I have given you madness too. That is the only way
to be sane in this insane world.</p><p><br></p><p>If you are too sane you will become part of this dead world, this
rotten society, this rotten humanity. You have to be a little mad to get
out of the rut.</p><p><br></p><p>Go hesitating, go mixed, go a little confused, but go full of
excitement. And whenever you feel tired, exhausted, and the world is too
much with you, come back.</p><p><br></p><p>I’m coming with you! I’m all for my mad people!</p><p><br></p><p>You can have as much confusion as you want – I will be your clarity!
Good!</p><p><br></p><p>Archana: It means prayer. It is one of the most beautiful names
possible. Remind me again about it, mm? For a few days be here and you
will start feeling what prayer is<span class=s4></span>Because in the
christian</p><p>countries, prayer is almost lost, and the formal prayer is thought to
be the prayer – it is not the prayer. Prayer has nothing to say – it is
more of silence.</p><p>Prayer is not to ask anything from god – rather it is to give. Prayer
is an offering of your being.</p><p>Prayer is losing yourself in the divine.</p><p><br></p><p>Prayer is not any verbal communication with god. Rather than saying
or talking, it is more like listening. If god speaks, you are ready to
listen.</p><p><br></p><p>So each morning when I am speaking, listen as silently as possible
and you will come to know what prayer is – and then you will know the
meaning of your name. Mm? It is silent listening, silent communication,
silent communion. When your mind is completely dropped and your heart
throbs with new life and a song is born in your heart – that is
prayer.</p><p><br></p><p>It will happen! When I give a name, I mean something.<span class=s4></span>It is going to happen – you will grow into</p><p>prayer.</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin says: I have decided to stay For a while<span class=s4></span>Nice feelings are coming.]</p><p><br></p><p>Mm, they will come. I was waiting – once the negativity has left,
nice feelings will come. They always come after the negativity has been
gone through. And my observation is that if somebody is, from the very
beginning, positive, his positivity never goes that deep. If somebody
comes here and falls into a negative mood, then it is only a question of
time. Once he comes out of the negative, the pendulum will swing to the
other extreme and he will become tremendously positive. And that makes
things total – the negative and the positive.</p><p><br></p><p>If you are simply positive towards me, then the positivity will miss
something in it – it will be just sweet. It needs to be bitter too. And
when the negativity and positivity are also there, then you are really
in a tremendous love affair – then the love-hate both are there. Then
you want to go away, and you cannot. You go two feet, and then you come
back four feet. Then it is really beautiful.</p><p><br></p><p>[Another sannyasin says: I feel very good. I’m so much more relaxed,
and.<span class=s4></span>I feel I’d like to do</p><p>something so the feeling continues. I’ve never really let myself
enjoy.]</p><p><br></p><p>Mm. So after the camp you join the sufi dancing – that will help you
and relax your body.</p><p><br></p><p>There are very few people who ever allow any happiness to themselves,
so then they are miserable. They go on crying and weeping, ‘Why are we
miserable?’ – and they never allow any happiness. If happiness comes,
they will close their doors; they are afraid of happiness.</p><p><br></p><p>And there is a rhythm, because whenever you are in a deep joy, you
are lost – you cannot control it; it is bigger than you. We have been
taught from the very beginning to control everything. You can control
misery – it is smaller than you. You can control anguish – it is smaller
than you. You cannot control ecstasy – it is too big, too vast, huge,
enormous; you are completely lost in it. It is oceanic, and you become a
small tiny wave.</p><p><br></p><p>This havoc happens because the idea has been implanted deeply into
you that everything has to be controlled; to remain in control. I teach
uncontrol. I say to be crazy, not to be worried about control. God is
enough to control it; you need not control. And the whole existence is
so beautifully controlled without any controller.</p><p><br></p><p>One who looks after the whole will look after you too. And if the
whole is going so smoothly, why be worried? Trust! But we bring in our
tiny ego and we start controlling and we want to manage our lives. Of
course we manage, and that management is nothing but the way to misery –
the sure way to misery.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why people have lost all capacity to be loose, to relax, to
delight, to celebrate, to dance. People are no more orgasmic – and a
real authentic person has to be orgasmic. Every fibre of your body and
your being should be throbbing with joy. But it is huge, and you will be
lost in it<span class=s4></span>nobody</p><p>knows what will happen! There is no need to know – whatsoever happens
is good.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part9>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

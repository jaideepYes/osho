EVERY MORNING HE WENT DOWN TO THE SEA TO ROAM WITH THE SEAGULLS. MORE BIRDS CAME TO HIM THAN COULD BE COUNTED IN HUNDREDS.\nHIS FATHER SAID TO HIM ONE DAY: I HEAR THE SEAGULLS ALL COME ROAMING WITH YOU – BRING ME SOME TO PLAY WITH.\nNEXT DAY, WHEN HE WENT TO THE SEA, THE SEAGULLS DANCED ABOVE HIM AND WOULD NOT COME DOWN.\nThe greatest secret of life is – and remember it always – that life is a gift. You have not deserved it in the first place. It is not your right. It has been given to you, you have not earned it. Once you understand this, many things will become clear.\nIf life is a gift then all that belongs to life is going to be a gift. Happiness, love, meditation – all that is beautiful is going to be a gift from the holy, from the whole. You cannot deserve it in any way and you cannot force existence to make you happy, or to make you loving, or to make you meditative. That very effort is of the ego. That very effort creates misery. That very effort goes against you. That very effort has destroyed you – it is suicidal.\nIn the American constitution they have given a right, a basic right – and they call it the basic fundamental right – to pursue happiness. It is impossible to pursue happiness. Nobody has ever pursued it. One has to wait for it. And it is not a right at all. No law court can force you to be happy\nor force happiness to be with you. No government violence is capable of making you happy. No power can make you happy.\nThe founding fathers committed a very deep mistake. It seems Jefferson didn’t know much about happiness. Politicians can’t know – they are the unhappiest people on earth. Jefferson added this right to the American constitution, and you will be surprised that because of this, the very wording of it, America has become one of the unhappiest countries in the world, everBecause the very\nidea that you can pursue happiness, that you can deserve it, that you can demand it, that you have the RIGHT to be happy, is foolish. Nobody has the right to be happy. You can be happy, but there is nothing like a right about it. And if you think that it is your right you will go on missing, because you have started to look in the wrong direction from the very beginning.\nWhy is it so? If life is a gift, all that belongs to and is intrinsic to life is going to be a gift. You can wait for it, you can be receptive to it, you can remain in a surrendered mood, waiting, patient, but you cannot demand, and you cannot force.\nEmile Coue is more alert than Jefferson. Emile Coue has discovered a law he calls The Law of Reverse Effect. There are certain things which, if you try to do, you will undo. If you don’t try to do them you may be able to do them. The very effort leads you to the reverse effect. For example, sleep. You want to go to sleep – what can you do? Everybody has a fundamental right to sleep, but what can you do? Can you ask the police to come and help? What can you do when you don’t feel like going to sleep? Whatsoever you do is going to disturb you because the very effort works against sleep. Sleep is an effortlessness. When you simply relax, not doing anything, by and by you drift into sleep. You cannot SWIM towards it – you drift. You cannot make any conscious effort.\nAnd this is the problem with all those people who suffer from sleeplessness, insomnia. All insomniacs have their rituals. They do certain things to cause sleep to come to them. And that is where they miss, that is where everything goes wrong. How can you force sleep? The more you force the more YOU will be there – aware, alert, conscious. Every effort will make you more aware, more alert, and sleep will be put off.\nWhat do you do when you want to go to sleep? You don’t do anything. You simply wait, in a restful mood. You simply allow sleep to come to you – you cannot force it. You cannot demand, you cannot say, “Come!” With closed eyes, in a dark room, on your pillow, you simply wait.and waiting,\nyou start drifting. Like a cloud glides, drifts, you drift by and by from the conscious mind to the unconscious.\nYou lose all control. You have to lose control; otherwise you cannot go to sleep, because the part that controls is the conscious mind. It has to allow. Control has to be left completely. Then – you don’t know when and why and how – sleep comes to you. Only in the morning you become aware that you have been asleep, and you slept well. Ninety-nine percent of people who suffer from sleeplessness create their own trouble. I have not come across more than one percent of insomniacs who are really suffering from something in their body chemistry. Ninety-nine percent are simply suffering because they don’t know Emile Coue’s Law of Reverse Effect. They are followers of Jefferson; they think sleep is a right.\nIn life, only on the surface, in the marketplace, rights exist. As you move deeper, rights disappear. As you move deeper, gifts appear. This is one of the most basic things to remember always: you\nhave not deserved life, and life is there! Absolutely undeserved, you are alive, with tremendous energy – alive!\nHow does it happen? And if life can happen without deserving it, without any right to it, why not happiness? why not love? why not ecstasy? They can all happen, but you have to understand the law. The law is: don’t try directly. Happiness cannot be pursued. It can be persuaded. Persuasion is indirect. It is not an attack. You move, but not directly, because when you are direct you are aggressive. Nothing is as direct as violence. And nothing is as violent as directness.\nLife moves in circles, not direct. The Earth moves around the sun. The sun moves around some greater sun. Galaxies move, the whole universe moves, in rounds. Seasons move in a round. Childhood, youth, old age, move in a round. The whole of life is circular, it never goes direct. It is not like an arrow that goes direct to the target. An arrow is man’s invention. In life there is nothing like an arrow. An arrow is man’s violent mind. An arrow chooses the very shortest cut between two points. The arrow is in a great hurry, seems to be too time-conscious. But God is not in a hurry.\nJust the other day I was reading a small booklet from Jesus freaks – ninety-nine percent nonsense, but one percent really beautiful! And even if something is one percent beautiful it is so much, because if you go to the Christian theologians, they are one hundred percent nonsense. The one percent that was meaningful, I loved. That part says, “Hurry kills! Haste is waste.” And God is not in a hurry. He moves with infinite patience. God is a loafer, he hangs around. In fact, God is not going anywhere – he is already there. So there is no goal. The arrow is dancing round and round and round. It is not going to any target – there is no target. Just BEING is the target. So God hangs around like the fragrance of a flower which hangs in a summer night – just around and around, nowhere to go.\nAnd God has infinite patience. He works with care, and in very indirect ways. He creates a baby, and takes nine months – he doesn’t seem to have any efficiency experts around him. This has been going on for millions of years, and he has not learned anything; otherwise he could have managed to create better instruments so that a baby could be created within nine minutes. Why nine months? And from the very beginning he has been doing the same thing; he has not learned anything. He should ask the experts, particularly the efficiency experts. They will show him how to produce, how to produce on a mass scale, and not waste so much time – nine months per baby!\nBut it is not only with babies – with flowers also he takes infinite care; with birds, even with a blade of grass he takes infinite care and time. He is not in a hurry. In fact it seems he is not aware of time at all. He exists timelessly. If you want to be with him, don’t be in a hurry; otherwise you will bypass him. He will be always loitering here and now, and you will always be going there and then. You will always be like an arrow, and he is not like an arrow.\nAnd to be with God is to be happy, to be with God is to be alive, to be with God is to be in meditation.\nBut the whole training of man is how to do things fast. Speed in itself seems to be a value. It is not. In itself it can create only madness – and it HAS created madness.\nMove indirectly. And what is indirectly?\nI used to know an old man who was always complaining, always grumpy. Everything was wrong – he was a born critic. And of course as critics suffer, he suffered, because sometimes it was too hot, and sometimes it was too cold, and sometimes it rained too much, and sometimes it didn’t rain at all. All seasons, all the year round, he was suffering. A negative mind, a negative attitude – and he was continuously in search of being happy, continuously making every effort to be contented and satisfied. But I have not seen a more discontented man than him; he was the very personification of suffering, dissatisfaction, discontent. In his eyes there was nothing but discontent. On his face many wrinkles of tension and discontent, all the grumblings of his whole life were written there.\nBut suddenly one day he changed. He had become sixty and the next day was his birthday; people came to greet him, and they could not believe their eyes – he had changed so suddenly, in the night. Somebody told me about it also, so I walked down to his house to inquire, because this was a revolution! The Russian Revolution was nothing compared to it. The Chinese Revolution, nothing compared to it. A revolution! For sixty years this man had trained himself for discontent. How, suddenly...? What had happened, what miracle? I could not believe that even Jesus could have done such a miracle, it was not possible, because you never hear in The BibleJesus cured blind\nmen, he cured the deaf and dumb, he cured even the dead, but you don’t hear a single story of Jesus curing anybody of discontent. It is not possible.\nI asked the old man – he was really happy, bubbling with happiness – I said, “What has happened to you?”\nHe said, “Enough is enough! For sixty years I tried to be happy and could not, so last night I decided: Now forget about it; don’t bother about happiness, just live. And here I am, happy.”\nHe PURSUED happiness for sixty years. If you pursue, you will become more and more unhappy. You are going direct, like an arrow, and God doesn’t believe in shortcuts. You will attain to YOUR target, but happiness will not be there.\nMillions of people attain their targets: they wanted to be successful, they are successful – but unhappy. They wanted to be rich, they are rich – but unhappy. The richer they get, the unhappier they become, because now even the hope is lost. They were thinking that when they became rich they would be happy; now they are rich, and happiness – they cannot see any sign of it anywhere. Now, with unhappiness hopelessness also settles.\nA poor man is never hopeless, a rich man always is. And if you find a rich man who is not yet hopeless it is certain he is not yet rich. Hopelessness is the symbol of being rich. A poor man can hope. Millions of things are there which he has not got. He can dream, he can hope that when these things are there he will have attained the target. Then everything will be okay, he will be happy.\nThis man pursued happiness for sixty years. At sixty death is coming nearer, and he must have felt it that night, because whenever a birthday comes a subtle feeling of death arises. To suppress that feeling we celebrate birthdays. Whenever a birthday comes, on that day it is impossible to forget death. To help you forget, friends come and greet you and they say, “This is your birthday.” Every birthday is a death day, because one more year has gone, death is nearing. In fact a birthday is not a birthday, cannot be – death is approaching, death is coming nearer. Time is slipping fast through the fingers. The very earth on which you are standing is being pulled away. Soon you will be in the\nabyss. A birthday is a death day. To hide it, to suppress it, the society has created tricks. People will come with flowers and gifts to help you forget that death is coming nearer – and they call it a birthday.\nHe had become sixty. Next morning a new birthday was approaching. He must have felt, he must have heard the sounds, the footsteps, of death somewhere around... the shadow. And he decided: Enough is enough. I pursued long – almost my whole life has been wasted in trying to be contented, and I could not be, so now I will do without. The old man said, “Now here I am. I have never been so contented as I am today, absolutely contented. There is no discontent, no unhappiness.”\nIn the very search you create unhappiness. When you don’t search, happiness searches for you. When you search, you search alone and you will not find. Where will you seek? How will you search? Mind can never be happy. Mind is your accumulated discontent. Mind is your accumulated unhappy past, the whole suffering that you have passed through: it is a wound in your being. And the mind tries to seek, to pursue, and you miss.\nWhen you forget about happiness, suddenly you are happy. When you forget about contentment, suddenly it is there. It has always been there around you, but YOU were not there. You were thinking: Somewhere in the future a target has to be achieved, happiness earned, contentment practiced. You were in the future and happiness was just around you like the fragrance of a flower.\nYes, God is a loafer. He is always loitering somewhere around. And you have gone too far, seeking. Come back home! And just be. Don’t bother about happiness. Life is there as a gift; happiness is also going to be there as a gift – a gift from the whole, a holy gift.\nWhen you are seeking too much you are closed; the very tension of seeking and searching closes you. When you are desiring too much, the very desire becomes such a tense state of affairs that happiness cannot penetrate you. Happiness penetrates you in the same way as sleep; contentment comes to you in the same way as sleep: when you are in a letgo, when you allow, when you simply wait, they come.\nIn fact, to say they come is not right: they are already there. In a letgo you can see them and feel them, because you are relaxed. In relaxation you become more sensitive – and happiness is the subtlest thing possible, the most subtle, the very cream of life, the essence. When you are relaxed in a total letgo, not doing anything, not going anywhere, not thinking of any goals, no target, not like an arrow but like a bow, relaxing, without tension – it is there.\nI have heard a story about a great mogul emperor, Babur, who conquered India. He became one of the greatest emperors in the world, ruled almost the biggest part of the world any man has ever ruled.\nA man, a very wise man, came to see him, but the wise man was very disappointed because Babur was talking to his court people in such a profane way – vulgar, cracking jokes; ordinary, not refined even – and laughing a belly laugh. The wise man was disappointed. He said, “I was thinking that you were a cultured man, and I have heard many stories that you love wisdom; that’s why I am here. I have heard that in your court you have many wise men, learned men, scholars, musicians, philosophers, religious men, and what do I see here? A simple vulgarity. It is intolerable. I cannot be here in your court a single moment more!”\nBabur said, “Just one moment, then you can go. Look in that corner.” In that corner was a bow. The wise man said, “What has that to do with the situation?”\nBabur said, “I cannot be always tense. If the bow is always tense, and the arrow is always on it, soon the bow will be broken. It will lose its elasticity. It won’t be flexible then, and a bow has to be flexible; only then is it alive... the more flexible, the more alive. That is my bow, and I am like my bow. Sometimes, yes, I am tense; the arrow is on it, the bow is stretched. But only sometimes. Then I rest and relax also.”\nI don’t know what happened to that wise man. I feel Babur was wiser than that wise man. A bow needs relaxation. You are also a bow. You also need relaxation.\nFor small matters, the world of the market, you can move like an arrow, because that is man-created. But for that which is not man-created, you cannot be like an arrow – you have to be like a relaxed bow.\nGod is total relaxation. Hence Patanjali says that perfect SAMADHI is like sleep, with only one difference – otherwise the quality is the same, the same flavor, the same taste – with just one difference: in sleep you are unconscious, in samadhi you are conscious. But the relaxation, the letgo, is the same. Everything untense, not going anywhere, not even a thought of going anywhere, just being here and now – suddenly everything starts happening.\nYou are not to do anything to be happy. In fact you have done too much to become unhappy. If you want to be unhappy, do too much. If you want to be happy, allow things, allow things to be. Rest, relax, and be in a letgo.\nLetgo is the secret of life. Letgo is the secret of religion. Letgo is the greatest secret. When you are in a letgo many things, millions of things, start happening. They were already happening but you were never aware. You could not be aware; you were engaged somewhere else, you were occupied.\nThe birds go on singing. The trees go on flowering. The rivers go on flowing. The whole is continuously happening, and the whole is very psychedelic, very colorful, with infinite celebrations going on. But you are so engaged, so occupied, so closed, with not even a single window open, no cross-ventilation in you. No sunrays can penetrate you, no breeze can blow through you, you are so solid, so closed, what Leibnitz called monads. You are monads. Monad means something without any windows, with no opening, with every possibility of opening closed. How can you be happy? So closed, how can you participate in the mysteries all around? How can you participate in the divine? You will have to come out. You will have to drop this enclosure, this imprisonment.\nWhere are you going? And you think that somewhere in the future there is some target to be achieved? Life is already here! Why wait for the future? Why postpone it for the future? Postponement is suicidal. Life is slow; that’s why you cannot feel it. It is very slow, and you are insensitive; otherwise postponement is the only poison. You kill yourself by and by. You go on postponing – and you go on missing the life that is here and now.\nFor those who have attained to the here and now, the whole life starts showering flowers on them. Many things start happening which they never dreamed of.\nWhen for the first time you are really relaxed in a meditative state, you cannot believe that life is so beautiful, so euphoric, such infinite bliss, such a SAT-CHIT-ANAND; you cannot believe it! It is unbelievable. When a Buddha reports, nobody believes. When a Jesus talks about his kingdom of God, nobody believes. Even those who follow, they also are not absolutely trusting.\nThere is a story that Thomas was Jesus’ most beloved disciple, but even he was not an absolute believer, even he doubted; hence the phrase, Doubting Thomas. Thomas was the most beloved disciple, the closest – and yet he too was a doubting Thomas.\nIt happened that Jesus was moving from one shore of Lake Galilee to the other shore. He told his disciples to move ahead and he would be coming. So they moved off in a boat. Then suddenly, when they were just in the middle of the lake, they couldn’t believe their eyes – Jesus was coming on the water, walking. They forgot everything about Jesus; they thought this must be a ghost. They had seen so many miracles, even the dead had been raised, but now they could not believe. They forgot everything in the moment of surprise, it was such an unbelievable phenomenon – Jesus walking on the water.\nThe disciples became so afraid and trembling, they started praying to God: “Save us! Who is this man coming? It must be a ghost! We are in danger.” Even Thomas cried, “Who are you?” when Jesus came near.\nJesus said, “Can’t you see me? Have you forgotten me completely? Can’t you believe that I am Jesus, your master?” But still they were trembling.\nThomas said, “If you are really Jesus and not a ghost, or the Devil in disguise, if you are really Jesus, and if you are really walking on the water, then let me also walk on the water, master.” This was a trick to test.\nJesus said, “Yes, you can come!” Then there was trouble. Thomas walked two, three steps. Yes, he could walk, but then the doubt arose: “Maybe this is the Devil playing a trick on me; otherwise how can I walk? It is impossible!” The thing was happening, he was walking on the water, but he couldn’t believe it himself: a doubt arose and immediately he sank into the lake and Jesus had to run and bring him out.\nAnd Jesus said, “You man of little faith.” From that day the phrase Doubting Thomas became prevalent. But he was the MOST beloved. The others were not even trusting enough to come out of the boat, even to TRY.\nWhen Jesus brings the news, the good news of the kingdom of God, nobody believes him. When Buddha talks about the infinite emptiness within, nobody believes him. We cannot believe! How can we believe unless we know? At least a glimpse is needed.\nWe live in such a suffering, hell, the news about the kingdom of God seems to be just a dream, a poetry maybe, but nothing more. Religion seems not more than literature: fictitious – great fiction, but nothing more. It has to be so, it is natural in a way, because you don’t know where you are standing, what is happening all around you. You are so insensitive, closed.…\nOpen the windows, break the doors open! And run out of this imprisonment, stand under the skies. Feel again! Thinking won’t help. Thinking can go on and on inside you without opening a single window. Only feeling brings you out of yourself – and you are so afraid of feeling, so much at ease with thinking and so afraid of feeling, because feeling will bring you out. It will bring you again into the very current of life. You will be in the river, moving towards the ocean.\nFeel more, think less, and by and by you will see that the more you can feel, the more relaxed you are. The more you can feel, the more you become aware of the secret of life – that you need not do anything about it, you just have to be available. Just available, I say, and everything comes to you. Once the idea arises to catch hold, to cling, everything disappears. This is the meaning of this Sufi story.\nTHERE WAS A MAN LIVING BY THE SEASHORE WHO LOVED SEAGULLS.\nLove is the very center of all feelings, love is the soul of all feelings. All feelings hang on love. If you don’t love, by and by all feelings will disappear. If you love, all feelings will be revived. And remember, I say ALL feelings: negative, positive, all. When you love, you start hating also – immediately. When you love, you start feeling anger also – immediately. When you love, you feel sad, you feel happy. When you love, all feelings are again back to life.\nThis is the trouble. That’s why no society allows love; because if it were the case that with love only good feelings, feelings that society decides are good, came up, there would be no trouble. But with love, the trouble is that not only heaven starts flowering, but hell also. They are together, they are two aspects of the same coin. They cannot be separated – and there is no need to separate them, because a heaven without a hell would be poorer. A love without anger would be impotent. A love without sadness would be shallow.\nLife is a polarity, and through polarities life becomes richer and richer and more and more complex. Life is not like ordinary Aristotelian logic, life is more like Hegelian dialectics: thesis, antithesis. Two polarities meet and fight, and a third phenomenon arises: synthesis. A greater harmony arises out of two polarities; then that greater harmony again becomes thesis, a new antithesis arises, then again a higher rung of the ladder of synthesis is reached.\nThis is how life moves. Life is Hegelian dialectics, it is not Aristotelian logic. It is not simple duality. It again and again reaches to oneness through duality – and that oneness again becomes a pole. It creates another pole; the movement starts. This is how life is trying to reach higher and higher pinnacles of being.\nWhen you love you become happy, and you become sad also. These are the thesis and antithesis. Love is a harmony, the synthesis. Life moves through opposites, just like a river moves through two banks. You cannot conceive of a river with one bank. If you conceive of this, then all rivers disappear. If you try to ensure that one shore will be better, then rivers cannot exist.\nThat’s what has happened to human consciousness. In the very beginning man decided against hate, against anger, against all negative poles, that they are not good. They are not good if they are alone, they are very bad. If a man is simply angry without love, he is mad. This anger is a disease. But if a man is angry because of love, a father angry with his child, with love, then anger has a beauty of its own.\nNo child will ever feel bad towards a parent who was angry with love. But a parent who was simply angry without love cannot be forgiven. The child may forget him, but he cannot forgive. Just anger, with no love? It is illness. It is poisonous. But if you are angry with love, the child understands. He understands your love. And in that bigger whole of love, the anger fits. It is just love in action, nothing else; and the child immediately feels it, and loves you more for it.\nA husband angry without love is just ego, trying to possess, dominate. A husband angry with love is not ego trying to possess, but love, trying to help. Even if anger is needed, love is ready to be angry.\nWhen love arises, all feelings erupt; a volcano explodes and man becomes afraid. So it is better, man decided, not to touch this volcano. Let it be there, hidden, because it brings negatives also. But those who know, they say don’t be afraid of the negative. The negative is bound to be there with the positive, like a shadow is bound to be with you. If you want no shadow, you will have to kill yourself. Then only can the shadow disappear. But nothing is wrong in a shadow. If you are there, nothing is wrong. If love is there, nothing is wrong.\nSomebody asked Saint Augustine, “Tell me in one sentence, in a simple sentence, the whole message of Christ, because I am an ignorant man, and I cannot understand the subtleties of theology. And I don’t know much about morality, so don’t give me complex disciplines I may not be able to follow. Give me a simple discipline, so simple that I can understand and follow.”\nIt is said Saint Augustine closed his eyes and meditated, and then he said, “Then there is only one thing – love, and everything else will follow.”\nLove is the greatest morality, because it brings the feeling part of you up, and the thinking part goes down. Nothing is wrong with the thinking part, but it is playing the role of the master, which is wrong. Reason is good if it helps feeling. Feeling should be the master and reason should be the servant. Feeling should guide and reason should manage. But if reason becomes the master and feeling has to follow, you will be dead... because how can you be alive only with reason? Life is feeling. Trees can exist without reason, but they cannot exist without feeling.\nNow even scientists are becoming more and more aware that trees feel, and feel tremendously. Stars, rocks, rivers – they cannot exist without feeling. Feeling is their very life. Birds, animals, the whole – exist with feeling. Except man. Man is upside down. The head has become the prominent thing, and head has been suppressing feeling.\nAnd it has happened all over life in that way. Politicians rule, dominate; in fact, poets should be the guides, not politicians. But as it happens in the atomic individual, so it happens on a vaster scale in society. If feeling rules the individual, then poets will rule life, then poets will rule nations. The world will be totally different. If the head rules, if reason rules the individual, then politicians will rule the world, and the world is going to be constantly in trouble, constantly at war, in constant conflict.\nIt is good to feel, and if feeling surrounds you, then there is nothing wrong in thinking. If thinking follows feeling – beautiful; it helps. It is like a radar. It opens the way for the feeling to move on. It protects the feeling from dangers. It helps the feeling to know what is going to happen next, to plan a little. It is good! But good only as a servant.\nIf you love, you will have a deep affinity with existence. Trees will talk to you. Birds will start coming nearer to you. Animals will not be afraid of you – there is no need. Man creates fear because of his head. With his heart he is again one with the universe.\nTHERE WAS A MAN LIVING BY THE SEASHORE WHO LOVED SEAGULLS. EVERY MORNING HE WENT DOWN TO THE SEA TO ROAM WITH THE SEAGULLS. MORE BIRDS CAME TO HIM THAN COULD BE COUNTED IN HUNDREDS.\nThousands of seagulls gathered around him. They jumped and hopped, and they flew and they danced, and they moved with him on the shore. The man was accepted by the seagulls, because feeling is everywhere accepted. That is the language of existence: feeling. Reason is the language of humanity, not of existence – a local phenomenon, not universal. Feeling is the language, the forgotten language. If you understand feeling, you understand the whole.\nlt is said of Lukman, one of the wisest men ever born – he is the founder of Yunani medicine – it is said about Lukman that he would go to plants, to bushes, trees, sit there, feel them, and ask them, “What use can you be put to? What disease can you be helpful in?” And it is said that he discovered millions of herbs, just by feeling them. The herb would say, “It will be good if you use me in tuberculosis; I can help.”\nThis looks like a myth, a fiction, but scientists have been at a loss: if this is a fiction, then how did Lukman come to know?... because whatsoever he knew has been proved by all scientific experiment to be right. And no laboratories existed then, like they exist today; not such refined instruments, not at all! If this is a fiction, then a greater problem arises: How did he come to know? And not one or two or a hundred herbs – millions! If he had been experimenting with crude implements then it would have taken at least ten to twenty thousand years for him to discover all that. That seems to be more fictitious. The first fiction seems to be nearer reality – that he asked.\nAnd there is the same story in India also. Ayurveda, the Indian medicine, is based on the same secret. Those secrets were revealed by the plants themselves. But then a language is needed, a language which is universal and not local to humanity. Feeling is that language. Greek or Arabic or Sanskrit won’t do. No language originating in the mind is divine language. No, the divine language originated in the heart. Feeling is the language.\nIf you start really feeling, and your heart starts really throbbing with feeling, you can ask a tree, and a tree is always ready to reveal its secret. You can ask a bird, and the bird is ready to reveal its secret. You can ask existence, and existence is ready to reveal its heart. That heart is God, the kingdom of God, the ecstasy, the final liberation, MOKSHA, nirvana; whatsoever you want to call it, you can call it.\nMORE BIRDS CAME TO HIM THAN COULD BE COUNTED IN HUNDREDS.\nHe knew the language of feeling. It is love. Nobody is afraid of love, not even birds. And they can certainly feel more than you because they have no thinking apparatus, no disturbance of the mind.\nIn the West now they are experimenting with plants. They say that if you come near a plant with the idea to pluck the flowers, just with the idea – you have not plucked the flowers yet – if just with\nthe idea you come near the plant then the whole plant starts trembling. A fear arises: the enemy is coming.\nNow they have made very refined instruments which can check what emotion the plant is going through. If it is fear, then just like a cardiogram, on the paper the instrument records fear. If you come with the idea to water the plant, the whole plant feels happy. This is recorded, the instrument goes on recording that the plant is very happy. You water the plant, the plant is satiated, very thankful; in fact, showing all gratefulness towards you.\nIt happened in one of the laboratories in New York, suddenly it happened: A scientist was working on insects, and a plant was in the room, a cactus plant. He was working with earthworms, experimenting in many ways – and scientists, in the name of experiment, are torturing many types of insects, animals; he threw one earthworm in hot boiling water. He was also working with plants, and the cactus plant was accidentally connected with the instrument that records the feelings of the plant. Suddenly the plant went through much anger, fear, a very violent state. An earthworm had just been thrown into hot water!\nLife is dying: a plant feels it. You cut one plant – the whole garden feels it, because everything is surrounded by an ocean of feeling, all around. You create vibrations. When you are angry you create vibrations. When you are lustful you create vibrations. When you are loving you create vibrations. Those vibrations are the universal language – they are understood by the whole existence.\nIt is said that when Buddha attained to enlightenment, trees flowered out of season. It may not be a fiction, it may be true. And one day we may be able to prove it scientifically, because if an earthworm, not related to a plant at all, of a totally different species, is thrown into hot water, and the death, the torture, the violence, is felt by the plant and the plant goes through a turmoil, a terrible turmoil, shaken to the very roots, then the other thing also seems possible.\nBuddha attains to nirvana, he becomes enlightened. One life has reached the goal: it does not seem too fictitious that the trees around him suddenly flower out of season, in celebration. If pain can be felt, celebration can also be felt. Just a few steps more and science will be saying, “Yes, this is not a fiction.” Life sometimes is stranger than fiction. It is.\nHIS FATHER SAID TO HIM ONE DAY: I HEAR THE SEAGULLS ALL COME ROAMING WITH YOU – BRING ME SOME TO PLAY WITH.\nNow an idea had entered the head. The man was no longer the same. Love was not there. The heart was not functioning that day. A desire had entered. He had a target now. He had come to the seashore now with a business. He was no more a friend to the seagulls – he was going to catch them – he was the enemy.\nNEXT DAY, WHEN HE WENT DOWN TO THE SEA, THE SEAGULLS DANCED OVER HIM AND WOULD NOT COME DOWN.\nThe seagulls cannot understand what you are thinking in the mind but they can understand the vibes that you are creating around – and you are continuously creating vibes around you. You are a continuous broadcast of vibes, CONTINUOUS. Whatsoever happens in your heart, it is just as if\nsomeone has thrown a stone in a lake: ripples arise, and they go on and on and on – they will go to the very end, to the very shore, all around. A feeling arises in you; immediately a stone has been thrown in the lake of your being. An idea arises in you – ripples arise. They go all around.\nThose seagulls don’t know exactly what the father has said to the son, because they don’t understand the local language of man. They don’t know what has really happened, but deep down they still know that this man is not the same. Somebody else has come, a stranger, not the old friend. Now he has come with an idea. The idea is not known, but throughout his whole body he is now not in a letgo. He has some idea to DO, some plan, some desire. He is not the same relaxed man with whom seagulls could feel at home.\nAnd this is the secret of the whole of life: not only seagulls but happiness, meditation, ecstasy – they all come to you when you are in a total letgo, in a deeply friendly mood, in a loving attitude towards existence. When you are at the heart, they come. When you are persuading them, and you think that happiness is something like a right, that you have to pursue it, suddenly the seagulls of happiness are not descending. They will dance above your head but they will never come down to play with you, to move with you, to jump and hop! No, they will never become one with you. They will not descend into your being.\nYes, happiness is a seagull. Meditation also is a seagull. Ecstasy is also a seagull. Existence understands only letgo. If you are in a letgo, you will attain. You will attain to whatsoever this existence can give you – and it can give you infinite blessings, infinite benediction. It can give you total satiety, contentment. You can become a buddha.\nExistence is ready to give, but you are not ready to take it, because you are thinking in terms of how to snatch it. Existence gives to you as gifts; you cannot snatch, you cannot conquer, you cannot achieve. You surrender, please. Please, be in a letgo.\nAll that is beautiful is like seagulls. Remember this: nothing can be done. The feast is already ready – you have been invited. You can enter from the front door. But you are foolish, you are trying to enter from the back door, and in existence there is no back door. You are trying to enter like a thief. The front door is open for you, and the host is waiting on the steps to receive you, and you are trying to enter from the back door like a thief.\nLife has no back doors. You cannot steal life. You cannot be a thief. Life gives, and gives infinitely and gives unconditionally. You please be just in a letgo. Let the seagulls descend and play with you, and loiter with you on the seashore. Everything is ready. The feast, the host – everything is ready, just waiting for you to come in from the front door. Effort is not needed. Effort is the back door. Effortlessness is needed.\nDon’t listen to Jefferson. Happiness is not a right, you cannot pursue it. You have to persuade it. It is like a shy woman: you have to court it, indirectly. You don’t go to a woman and say, “I would like to go to bed with you.” That is too direct, too insulting, too vulgar. Any worthwhile woman would slap your face. One has to be a little more subtle with a woman. One has to be a little more indirect.\nPatience is needed. Poetry is needed. And even if you have the idea in your mind to go to bed, that will be a disturbance, that will create an unbridgeable gap. If the idea is not there then you simply\nenjoy being with this woman. One day you will go to bed with her, but that will happen. The seagulls will descend on you.\nLet life happen, don’t try to force it. Through doing, only worthless things are achieved; through nondoing – all that is beautiful, all that is sacred, all that is divine.\nEnough for today.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"7294","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/just_like_that/part7/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/just_like_that/>Just Like That</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">7 A man who loved seagulls</h1><div class=post-meta>35 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;7294 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Just_Like_That/part7.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part6>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

MORNING HE WENT DOWN TO THE SEA TO ROAM WITH THE SEAGULLS. MORE BIRDS
CAME TO HIM THAN COULD BE COUNTED IN HUNDREDS.</p><p><br></p><p>HIS FATHER SAID TO HIM ONE DAY: I HEAR THE SEAGULLS ALL COME ROAMING
WITH YOU – BRING ME SOME TO PLAY WITH.</p><p><br></p><p>NEXT DAY, WHEN HE WENT TO THE SEA, THE SEAGULLS DANCED ABOVE HIM AND
WOULD NOT COME DOWN.</p><p><br></p><p>The greatest secret of life is – and remember it always – that life
is a gift. You have not deserved it in the first place. It is not your
right. It has been given to you, you have not earned it. Once you
understand this, many things will become clear.</p><p><br></p><p>If life is a gift then all that belongs to life is going to be a
gift. Happiness, love, meditation – all that is beautiful is going to be
a gift from the holy, from the whole. You cannot deserve it in any way
and you cannot force existence to make you happy, or to make you loving,
or to make you meditative. That very effort is of the ego. That very
effort creates misery. That very effort goes against you. That very
effort has destroyed you – it is suicidal.</p><p><br></p><p>In the American constitution they have given a right, a basic right –
and they call it the basic fundamental right – to pursue happiness. It
is impossible to pursue happiness. Nobody has ever pursued it. One has
to wait for it. And it is not a right at all. No law court can force you
to be happy</p><p>or force happiness to be with you. No government violence is capable
of making you happy. No power can make you happy.</p><p><br></p><p>The founding fathers committed a very deep mistake. It seems
Jefferson didn’t know much about happiness. Politicians can’t know –
they are the unhappiest people on earth. Jefferson added this right to
the American constitution, and you will be surprised that because of
this, the very wording of it, America has become one of the unhappiest
countries in the world, ever<span class=s4></span>Because the very</p><p>idea that you can pursue happiness, that you can deserve it, that you
can demand it, that you have the RIGHT to be happy, is foolish. Nobody
has the right to be happy. You can be happy, but there is nothing like a
right about it. And if you think that it is your right you will go on
missing, because you have started to look in the wrong direction from
the very beginning.</p><p><br></p><p>Why is it so? If life is a gift, all that belongs to and is intrinsic
to life is going to be a gift. You can wait for it, you can be receptive
to it, you can remain in a surrendered mood, waiting, patient, but you
cannot demand, and you cannot force.</p><p><br></p><p>Emile Coue is more alert than Jefferson. Emile Coue has discovered a
law he calls The Law of Reverse Effect. There are certain things which,
if you try to do, you will undo. If you don’t try to do them you may be
able to do them. The very effort leads you to the reverse effect. For
example, sleep. You want to go to sleep – what can you do? Everybody has
a fundamental right to sleep, but what can you do? Can you ask the
police to come and help? What can you do when you don’t feel like going
to sleep? Whatsoever you do is going to disturb you because the very
effort works against sleep. Sleep is an effortlessness. When you simply
relax, not doing anything, by and by you drift into sleep. You cannot
SWIM towards it – you drift. You cannot make any conscious effort.</p><p><br></p><p>And this is the problem with all those people who suffer from
sleeplessness, insomnia. All insomniacs have their rituals. They do
certain things to cause sleep to come to them. And that is where they
miss, that is where everything goes wrong. How can you force sleep? The
more you force the more YOU will be there – aware, alert, conscious.
Every effort will make you more aware, more alert, and sleep will be put
off.</p><p><br></p><p>What do you do when you want to go to sleep? You don’t do anything.
You simply wait, in a restful mood. You simply allow sleep to come to
you – you cannot force it. You cannot demand, you cannot say, “Come!”
With closed eyes, in a dark room, on your pillow, you simply wait.<span class=s4></span>and waiting,</p><p>you start drifting. Like a cloud glides, drifts, you drift by and by
from the conscious mind to the unconscious.</p><p><br></p><p>You lose all control. You have to lose control; otherwise you cannot
go to sleep, because the part that controls is the conscious mind. It
has to allow. Control has to be left completely. Then – you don’t know
when and why and how – sleep comes to you. Only in the morning you
become aware that you have been asleep, and you slept well. Ninety-nine
percent of people who suffer from sleeplessness create their own
trouble. I have not come across more than one percent of insomniacs who
are really suffering from something in their body chemistry. Ninety-nine
percent are simply suffering because they don’t know Emile Coue’s Law of
Reverse Effect. They are followers of Jefferson; they think sleep is a
right.</p><p><br></p><p>In life, only on the surface, in the marketplace, rights exist. As
you move deeper, rights disappear. As you move deeper, gifts appear.
This is one of the most basic things to remember always: you</p><p>have not deserved life, and life is there! Absolutely undeserved, you
are alive, with tremendous energy – alive!</p><p><br></p><p>How does it happen? And if life can happen without deserving it,
without any right to it, why not happiness? why not love? why not
ecstasy? They can all happen, but you have to understand the law. The
law is: don’t try directly. Happiness cannot be pursued. It can be
persuaded. Persuasion is indirect. It is not an attack. You move, but
not directly, because when you are direct you are aggressive. Nothing is
as direct as violence. And nothing is as violent as directness.</p><p><br></p><p>Life moves in circles, not direct. The Earth moves around the sun.
The sun moves around some greater sun. Galaxies move, the whole universe
moves, in rounds. Seasons move in a round. Childhood, youth, old age,
move in a round. The whole of life is circular, it never goes direct. It
is not like an arrow that goes direct to the target. An arrow is man’s
invention. In life there is nothing like an arrow. An arrow is man’s
violent mind. An arrow chooses the very shortest cut between two points.
The arrow is in a great hurry, seems to be too time-conscious. But God
is not in a hurry.</p><p><br></p><p>Just the other day I was reading a small booklet from Jesus freaks –
ninety-nine percent nonsense, but one percent really beautiful! And even
if something is one percent beautiful it is so much, because if you go
to the Christian theologians, they are one hundred percent nonsense. The
one percent that was meaningful, I loved. That part says, “Hurry kills!
Haste is waste.” And God is not in a hurry. He moves with infinite
patience. God is a loafer, he hangs around. In fact, God is not going
anywhere – he is already there. So there is no goal. The arrow is
dancing round and round and round. It is not going to any target – there
is no target. Just BEING is the target. So God hangs around like the
fragrance of a flower which hangs in a summer night – just around and
around, nowhere to go.</p><p><br></p><p>And God has infinite patience. He works with care, and in very
indirect ways. He creates a baby, and takes nine months – he doesn’t
seem to have any efficiency experts around him. This has been going on
for millions of years, and he has not learned anything; otherwise he
could have managed to create better instruments so that a baby could be
created within nine minutes. Why nine months? And from the very
beginning he has been doing the same thing; he has not learned anything.
He should ask the experts, particularly the efficiency experts. They
will show him how to produce, how to produce on a mass scale, and not
waste so much time – nine months per baby!</p><p><br></p><p>But it is not only with babies – with flowers also he takes infinite
care; with birds, even with a blade of grass he takes infinite care and
time. He is not in a hurry. In fact it seems he is not aware of time at
all. He exists timelessly. If you want to be with him, don’t be in a
hurry; otherwise you will bypass him. He will be always loitering here
and now, and you will always be going there and then. You will always be
like an arrow, and he is not like an arrow.</p><p><br></p><p>And to be with God is to be happy, to be with God is to be alive, to
be with God is to be in meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>But the whole training of man is how to do things fast. Speed in
itself seems to be a value. It is not. In itself it can create only
madness – and it HAS created madness.</p><p><br></p><p>Move indirectly. And what is indirectly?</p><p>I used to know an old man who was always complaining, always grumpy.
Everything was wrong – he was a born critic. And of course as critics
suffer, he suffered, because sometimes it was too hot, and sometimes it
was too cold, and sometimes it rained too much, and sometimes it didn’t
rain at all. All seasons, all the year round, he was suffering. A
negative mind, a negative attitude – and he was continuously in search
of being happy, continuously making every effort to be contented and
satisfied. But I have not seen a more discontented man than him; he was
the very personification of suffering, dissatisfaction, discontent. In
his eyes there was nothing but discontent. On his face many wrinkles of
tension and discontent, all the grumblings of his whole life were
written there.</p><p><br></p><p>But suddenly one day he changed. He had become sixty and the next day
was his birthday; people came to greet him, and they could not believe
their eyes – he had changed so suddenly, in the night. Somebody told me
about it also, so I walked down to his house to inquire, because this
was a revolution! The Russian Revolution was nothing compared to it. The
Chinese Revolution, nothing compared to it. A revolution! For sixty
years this man had trained himself for discontent. How, suddenly...?
What had happened, what miracle? I could not believe that even Jesus
could have done such a miracle, it was not possible, because you never
hear in The Bible<span class=s4></span>Jesus cured blind</p><p>men, he cured the deaf and dumb, he cured even the dead, but you
don’t hear a single story of Jesus curing anybody of discontent. It is
not possible.</p><p><br></p><p>I asked the old man – he was really happy, bubbling with happiness –
I said, “What has happened to you?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Enough is enough! For sixty years I tried to be happy and
could not, so last night I decided: Now forget about it; don’t bother
about happiness, just live. And here I am, happy.”</p><p><br></p><p>He PURSUED happiness for sixty years. If you pursue, you will become
more and more unhappy. You are going direct, like an arrow, and God
doesn’t believe in shortcuts. You will attain to YOUR target, but
happiness will not be there.</p><p><br></p><p>Millions of people attain their targets: they wanted to be
successful, they are successful – but unhappy. They wanted to be rich,
they are rich – but unhappy. The richer they get, the unhappier they
become, because now even the hope is lost. They were thinking that when
they became rich they would be happy; now they are rich, and happiness –
they cannot see any sign of it anywhere. Now, with unhappiness
hopelessness also settles.</p><p><br></p><p>A poor man is never hopeless, a rich man always is. And if you find a
rich man who is not yet hopeless it is certain he is not yet rich.
Hopelessness is the symbol of being rich. A poor man can hope. Millions
of things are there which he has not got. He can dream, he can hope that
when these things are there he will have attained the target. Then
everything will be okay, he will be happy.</p><p><br></p><p>This man pursued happiness for sixty years. At sixty death is coming
nearer, and he must have felt it that night, because whenever a birthday
comes a subtle feeling of death arises. To suppress that feeling we
celebrate birthdays. Whenever a birthday comes, on that day it is
impossible to forget death. To help you forget, friends come and greet
you and they say, “This is your birthday.” Every birthday is a death
day, because one more year has gone, death is nearing. In fact a
birthday is not a birthday, cannot be – death is approaching, death is
coming nearer. Time is slipping fast through the fingers. The very earth
on which you are standing is being pulled away. Soon you will be in
the</p><p>abyss. A birthday is a death day. To hide it, to suppress it, the
society has created tricks. People will come with flowers and gifts to
help you forget that death is coming nearer – and they call it a
birthday.</p><p><br></p><p>He had become sixty. Next morning a new birthday was approaching. He
must have felt, he must have heard the sounds, the footsteps, of death
somewhere around... the shadow. And he decided: Enough is enough. I
pursued long – almost my whole life has been wasted in trying to be
contented, and I could not be, so now I will do without. The old man
said, “Now here I am. I have never been so contented as I am today,
absolutely contented. There is no discontent, no unhappiness.”</p><p><br></p><p>In the very search you create unhappiness. When you don’t search,
happiness searches for you. When you search, you search alone and you
will not find. Where will you seek? How will you search? Mind can never
be happy. Mind is your accumulated discontent. Mind is your accumulated
unhappy past, the whole suffering that you have passed through: it is a
wound in your being. And the mind tries to seek, to pursue, and you
miss.</p><p><br></p><p>When you forget about happiness, suddenly you are happy. When you
forget about contentment, suddenly it is there. It has always been there
around you, but YOU were not there. You were thinking: Somewhere in the
future a target has to be achieved, happiness earned, contentment
practiced. You were in the future and happiness was just around you like
the fragrance of a flower.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, God is a loafer. He is always loitering somewhere around. And
you have gone too far, seeking. Come back home! And just be. Don’t
bother about happiness. Life is there as a gift; happiness is also going
to be there as a gift – a gift from the whole, a holy gift.</p><p><br></p><p>When you are seeking too much you are closed; the very tension of
seeking and searching closes you. When you are desiring too much, the
very desire becomes such a tense state of affairs that happiness cannot
penetrate you. Happiness penetrates you in the same way as sleep;
contentment comes to you in the same way as sleep: when you are in a
letgo, when you allow, when you simply wait, they come.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, to say they come is not right: they are already there. In a
letgo you can see them and feel them, because you are relaxed. In
relaxation you become more sensitive – and happiness is the subtlest
thing possible, the most subtle, the very cream of life, the essence.
When you are relaxed in a total letgo, not doing anything, not going
anywhere, not thinking of any goals, no target, not like an arrow but
like a bow, relaxing, without tension – it is there.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard a story about a great mogul emperor, Babur, who
conquered India. He became one of the greatest emperors in the world,
ruled almost the biggest part of the world any man has ever ruled.</p><p><br></p><p>A man, a very wise man, came to see him, but the wise man was very
disappointed because Babur was talking to his court people in such a
profane way – vulgar, cracking jokes; ordinary, not refined even – and
laughing a belly laugh. The wise man was disappointed. He said, “I was
thinking that you were a cultured man, and I have heard many stories
that you love wisdom; that’s why I am here. I have heard that in your
court you have many wise men, learned men, scholars, musicians,
philosophers, religious men, and what do I see here? A simple vulgarity.
It is intolerable. I cannot be here in your court a single moment
more!”</p><p>Babur said, “Just one moment, then you can go. Look in that corner.”
In that corner was a bow. The wise man said, “What has that to do with
the situation?”</p><p>Babur said, “I cannot be always tense. If the bow is always tense,
and the arrow is always on it, soon the bow will be broken. It will lose
its elasticity. It won’t be flexible then, and a bow has to be flexible;
only then is it alive... the more flexible, the more alive. That is my
bow, and I am like my bow. Sometimes, yes, I am tense; the arrow is on
it, the bow is stretched. But only sometimes. Then I rest and relax
also.”</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t know what happened to that wise man. I feel Babur was wiser
than that wise man. A bow needs relaxation. You are also a bow. You also
need relaxation.</p><p><br></p><p>For small matters, the world of the market, you can move like an
arrow, because that is man-created. But for that which is not
man-created, you cannot be like an arrow – you have to be like a relaxed
bow.</p><p><br></p><p>God is total relaxation. Hence Patanjali says that perfect SAMADHI is
like sleep, with only one difference – otherwise the quality is the
same, the same flavor, the same taste – with just one difference: in
sleep you are unconscious, in samadhi you are conscious. But the
relaxation, the letgo, is the same. Everything untense, not going
anywhere, not even a thought of going anywhere, just being here and now
– suddenly everything starts happening.</p><p><br></p><p>You are not to do anything to be happy. In fact you have done too
much to become unhappy. If you want to be unhappy, do too much. If you
want to be happy, allow things, allow things to be. Rest, relax, and be
in a letgo.</p><p><br></p><p>Letgo is the secret of life. Letgo is the secret of religion. Letgo
is the greatest secret. When you are in a letgo many things, millions of
things, start happening. They were already happening but you were never
aware. You could not be aware; you were engaged somewhere else, you were
occupied.</p><p><br></p><p>The birds go on singing. The trees go on flowering. The rivers go on
flowing. The whole is continuously happening, and the whole is very
psychedelic, very colorful, with infinite celebrations going on. But you
are so engaged, so occupied, so closed, with not even a single window
open, no cross-ventilation in you. No sunrays can penetrate you, no
breeze can blow through you, you are so solid, so closed, what Leibnitz
called monads. You are monads. Monad means something without any
windows, with no opening, with every possibility of opening closed. How
can you be happy? So closed, how can you participate in the mysteries
all around? How can you participate in the divine? You will have to come
out. You will have to drop this enclosure, this imprisonment.</p><p><br></p><p>Where are you going? And you think that somewhere in the future there
is some target to be achieved? Life is already here! Why wait for the
future? Why postpone it for the future? Postponement is suicidal. Life
is slow; that’s why you cannot feel it. It is very slow, and you are
insensitive; otherwise postponement is the only poison. You kill
yourself by and by. You go on postponing – and you go on missing the
life that is here and now.</p><p><br></p><p>For those who have attained to the here and now, the whole life
starts showering flowers on them. Many things start happening which they
never dreamed of.</p><p>When for the first time you are really relaxed in a meditative state,
you cannot believe that life is so beautiful, so euphoric, such infinite
bliss, such a SAT-CHIT-ANAND; you cannot believe it! It is unbelievable.
When a Buddha reports, nobody believes. When a Jesus talks about his
kingdom of God, nobody believes. Even those who follow, they also are
not absolutely trusting.</p><p><br></p><p>There is a story that Thomas was Jesus’ most beloved disciple, but
even he was not an absolute believer, even he doubted; hence the phrase,
Doubting Thomas. Thomas was the most beloved disciple, the closest – and
yet he too was a doubting Thomas.</p><p><br></p><p>It happened that Jesus was moving from one shore of Lake Galilee to
the other shore. He told his disciples to move ahead and he would be
coming. So they moved off in a boat. Then suddenly, when they were just
in the middle of the lake, they couldn’t believe their eyes – Jesus was
coming on the water, walking. They forgot everything about Jesus; they
thought this must be a ghost. They had seen so many miracles, even the
dead had been raised, but now they could not believe. They forgot
everything in the moment of surprise, it was such an unbelievable
phenomenon – Jesus walking on the water.</p><p><br></p><p>The disciples became so afraid and trembling, they started praying to
God: “Save us! Who is this man coming? It must be a ghost! We are in
danger.” Even Thomas cried, “Who are you?” when Jesus came near.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus said, “Can’t you see me? Have you forgotten me completely?
Can’t you believe that I am Jesus, your master?” But still they were
trembling.</p><p><br></p><p>Thomas said, “If you are really Jesus and not a ghost, or the Devil
in disguise, if you are really Jesus, and if you are really walking on
the water, then let me also walk on the water, master.” This was a trick
to test.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus said, “Yes, you can come!” Then there was trouble. Thomas
walked two, three steps. Yes, he could walk, but then the doubt arose:
“Maybe this is the Devil playing a trick on me; otherwise how can I
walk? It is impossible!” The thing was happening, he was walking on the
water, but he couldn’t believe it himself: a doubt arose and immediately
he sank into the lake and Jesus had to run and bring him out.</p><p><br></p><p>And Jesus said, “You man of little faith.” From that day the phrase
Doubting Thomas became prevalent. But he was the MOST beloved. The
others were not even trusting enough to come out of the boat, even to
TRY.</p><p><br></p><p>When Jesus brings the news, the good news of the kingdom of God,
nobody believes him. When Buddha talks about the infinite emptiness
within, nobody believes him. We cannot believe! How can we believe
unless we know? At least a glimpse is needed.</p><p><br></p><p>We live in such a suffering, hell, the news about the kingdom of God
seems to be just a dream, a poetry maybe, but nothing more. Religion
seems not more than literature: fictitious – great fiction, but nothing
more. It has to be so, it is natural in a way, because you don’t know
where you are standing, what is happening all around you. You are so
insensitive, closed.…</p><p>Open the windows, break the doors open! And run out of this
imprisonment, stand under the skies. Feel again! Thinking won’t help.
Thinking can go on and on inside you without opening a single window.
Only feeling brings you out of yourself – and you are so afraid of
feeling, so much at ease with thinking and so afraid of feeling, because
feeling will bring you out. It will bring you again into the very
current of life. You will be in the river, moving towards the ocean.</p><p><br></p><p>Feel more, think less, and by and by you will see that the more you
can feel, the more relaxed you are. The more you can feel, the more you
become aware of the secret of life – that you need not do anything about
it, you just have to be available. Just available, I say, and everything
comes to you. Once the idea arises to catch hold, to cling, everything
disappears. This is the meaning of this Sufi story.</p><p><br></p><p>THERE WAS A MAN LIVING BY THE SEASHORE WHO LOVED SEAGULLS.</p><p><br></p><p>Love is the very center of all feelings, love is the soul of all
feelings. All feelings hang on love. If you don’t love, by and by all
feelings will disappear. If you love, all feelings will be revived. And
remember, I say ALL feelings: negative, positive, all. When you love,
you start hating also – immediately. When you love, you start feeling
anger also – immediately. When you love, you feel sad, you feel happy.
When you love, all feelings are again back to life.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the trouble. That’s why no society allows love; because if it
were the case that with love only good feelings, feelings that society
decides are good, came up, there would be no trouble. But with love, the
trouble is that not only heaven starts flowering, but hell also. They
are together, they are two aspects of the same coin. They cannot be
separated – and there is no need to separate them, because a heaven
without a hell would be poorer. A love without anger would be impotent.
A love without sadness would be shallow.</p><p><br></p><p>Life is a polarity, and through polarities life becomes richer and
richer and more and more complex. Life is not like ordinary Aristotelian
logic, life is more like Hegelian dialectics: thesis, antithesis. Two
polarities meet and fight, and a third phenomenon arises: synthesis. A
greater harmony arises out of two polarities; then that greater harmony
again becomes thesis, a new antithesis arises, then again a higher rung
of the ladder of synthesis is reached.</p><p><br></p><p>This is how life moves. Life is Hegelian dialectics, it is not
Aristotelian logic. It is not simple duality. It again and again reaches
to oneness through duality – and that oneness again becomes a pole. It
creates another pole; the movement starts. This is how life is trying to
reach higher and higher pinnacles of being.</p><p><br></p><p>When you love you become happy, and you become sad also. These are
the thesis and antithesis. Love is a harmony, the synthesis. Life moves
through opposites, just like a river moves through two banks. You cannot
conceive of a river with one bank. If you conceive of this, then all
rivers disappear. If you try to ensure that one shore will be better,
then rivers cannot exist.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what has happened to human consciousness. In the very
beginning man decided against hate, against anger, against all negative
poles, that they are not good. They are not good if they are alone, they
are very bad. If a man is simply angry without love, he is mad. This
anger is a disease. But if a man is angry because of love, a father
angry with his child, with love, then anger has a beauty of its own.</p><p>No child will ever feel bad towards a parent who was angry with love.
But a parent who was simply angry without love cannot be forgiven. The
child may forget him, but he cannot forgive. Just anger, with no love?
It is illness. It is poisonous. But if you are angry with love, the
child understands. He understands your love. And in that bigger whole of
love, the anger fits. It is just love in action, nothing else; and the
child immediately feels it, and loves you more for it.</p><p><br></p><p>A husband angry without love is just ego, trying to possess,
dominate. A husband angry with love is not ego trying to possess, but
love, trying to help. Even if anger is needed, love is ready to be
angry.</p><p><br></p><p>When love arises, all feelings erupt; a volcano explodes and man
becomes afraid. So it is better, man decided, not to touch this volcano.
Let it be there, hidden, because it brings negatives also. But those who
know, they say don’t be afraid of the negative. The negative is bound to
be there with the positive, like a shadow is bound to be with you. If
you want no shadow, you will have to kill yourself. Then only can the
shadow disappear. But nothing is wrong in a shadow. If you are there,
nothing is wrong. If love is there, nothing is wrong.</p><p><br></p><p>Somebody asked Saint Augustine, “Tell me in one sentence, in a simple
sentence, the whole message of Christ, because I am an ignorant man, and
I cannot understand the subtleties of theology. And I don’t know much
about morality, so don’t give me complex disciplines I may not be able
to follow. Give me a simple discipline, so simple that I can understand
and follow.”</p><p><br></p><p>It is said Saint Augustine closed his eyes and meditated, and then he
said, “Then there is only one thing – love, and everything else will
follow.”</p><p><br></p><p>Love is the greatest morality, because it brings the feeling part of
you up, and the thinking part goes down. Nothing is wrong with the
thinking part, but it is playing the role of the master, which is wrong.
Reason is good if it helps feeling. Feeling should be the master and
reason should be the servant. Feeling should guide and reason should
manage. But if reason becomes the master and feeling has to follow, you
will be dead... because how can you be alive only with reason? Life is
feeling. Trees can exist without reason, but they cannot exist without
feeling.</p><p><br></p><p>Now even scientists are becoming more and more aware that trees feel,
and feel tremendously. Stars, rocks, rivers – they cannot exist without
feeling. Feeling is their very life. Birds, animals, the whole – exist
with feeling. Except man. Man is upside down. The head has become the
prominent thing, and head has been suppressing feeling.</p><p><br></p><p>And it has happened all over life in that way. Politicians rule,
dominate; in fact, poets should be the guides, not politicians. But as
it happens in the atomic individual, so it happens on a vaster scale in
society. If feeling rules the individual, then poets will rule life,
then poets will rule nations. The world will be totally different. If
the head rules, if reason rules the individual, then politicians will
rule the world, and the world is going to be constantly in trouble,
constantly at war, in constant conflict.</p><p><br></p><p>It is good to feel, and if feeling surrounds you, then there is
nothing wrong in thinking. If thinking follows feeling – beautiful; it
helps. It is like a radar. It opens the way for the feeling to move on.
It protects the feeling from dangers. It helps the feeling to know what
is going to happen next, to plan a little. It is good! But good only as
a servant.</p><p>If you love, you will have a deep affinity with existence. Trees will
talk to you. Birds will start coming nearer to you. Animals will not be
afraid of you – there is no need. Man creates fear because of his head.
With his heart he is again one with the universe.</p><p><br></p><p>THERE WAS A MAN LIVING BY THE SEASHORE WHO LOVED SEAGULLS. EVERY
MORNING HE WENT DOWN TO THE SEA TO ROAM WITH THE SEAGULLS. MORE BIRDS
CAME TO HIM THAN COULD BE COUNTED IN HUNDREDS.</p><p><br></p><p>Thousands of seagulls gathered around him. They jumped and hopped,
and they flew and they danced, and they moved with him on the shore. The
man was accepted by the seagulls, because feeling is everywhere
accepted. That is the language of existence: feeling. Reason is the
language of humanity, not of existence – a local phenomenon, not
universal. Feeling is the language, the forgotten language. If you
understand feeling, you understand the whole.</p><p><br></p><p>lt is said of Lukman, one of the wisest men ever born – he is the
founder of Yunani medicine – it is said about Lukman that he would go to
plants, to bushes, trees, sit there, feel them, and ask them, “What use
can you be put to? What disease can you be helpful in?” And it is said
that he discovered millions of herbs, just by feeling them. The herb
would say, “It will be good if you use me in tuberculosis; I can
help.”</p><p><br></p><p>This looks like a myth, a fiction, but scientists have been at a
loss: if this is a fiction, then how did Lukman come to know?... because
whatsoever he knew has been proved by all scientific experiment to be
right. And no laboratories existed then, like they exist today; not such
refined instruments, not at all! If this is a fiction, then a greater
problem arises: How did he come to know? And not one or two or a hundred
herbs – millions! If he had been experimenting with crude implements
then it would have taken at least ten to twenty thousand years for him
to discover all that. That seems to be more fictitious. The first
fiction seems to be nearer reality – that he asked.</p><p><br></p><p>And there is the same story in India also. Ayurveda, the Indian
medicine, is based on the same secret. Those secrets were revealed by
the plants themselves. But then a language is needed, a language which
is universal and not local to humanity. Feeling is that language. Greek
or Arabic or Sanskrit won’t do. No language originating in the mind is
divine language. No, the divine language originated in the heart.
Feeling is the language.</p><p><br></p><p>If you start really feeling, and your heart starts really throbbing
with feeling, you can ask a tree, and a tree is always ready to reveal
its secret. You can ask a bird, and the bird is ready to reveal its
secret. You can ask existence, and existence is ready to reveal its
heart. That heart is God, the kingdom of God, the ecstasy, the final
liberation, MOKSHA, nirvana; whatsoever you want to call it, you can
call it.</p><p><br></p><p>MORE BIRDS CAME TO HIM THAN COULD BE COUNTED IN HUNDREDS.</p><p><br></p><p>He knew the language of feeling. It is love. Nobody is afraid of
love, not even birds. And they can certainly feel more than you because
they have no thinking apparatus, no disturbance of the mind.</p><p><br></p><p>In the West now they are experimenting with plants. They say that if
you come near a plant with the idea to pluck the flowers, just with the
idea – you have not plucked the flowers yet – if just with</p><p>the idea you come near the plant then the whole plant starts
trembling. A fear arises: the enemy is coming.</p><p><br></p><p>Now they have made very refined instruments which can check what
emotion the plant is going through. If it is fear, then just like a
cardiogram, on the paper the instrument records fear. If you come with
the idea to water the plant, the whole plant feels happy. This is
recorded, the instrument goes on recording that the plant is very happy.
You water the plant, the plant is satiated, very thankful; in fact,
showing all gratefulness towards you.</p><p><br></p><p>It happened in one of the laboratories in New York, suddenly it
happened: A scientist was working on insects, and a plant was in the
room, a cactus plant. He was working with earthworms, experimenting in
many ways – and scientists, in the name of experiment, are torturing
many types of insects, animals; he threw one earthworm in hot boiling
water. He was also working with plants, and the cactus plant was
accidentally connected with the instrument that records the feelings of
the plant. Suddenly the plant went through much anger, fear, a very
violent state. An earthworm had just been thrown into hot water!</p><p><br></p><p>Life is dying: a plant feels it. You cut one plant – the whole garden
feels it, because everything is surrounded by an ocean of feeling, all
around. You create vibrations. When you are angry you create vibrations.
When you are lustful you create vibrations. When you are loving you
create vibrations. Those vibrations are the universal language – they
are understood by the whole existence.</p><p><br></p><p>It is said that when Buddha attained to enlightenment, trees flowered
out of season. It may not be a fiction, it may be true. And one day we
may be able to prove it scientifically, because if an earthworm, not
related to a plant at all, of a totally different species, is thrown
into hot water, and the death, the torture, the violence, is felt by the
plant and the plant goes through a turmoil, a terrible turmoil, shaken
to the very roots, then the other thing also seems possible.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha attains to nirvana, he becomes enlightened. One life has
reached the goal: it does not seem too fictitious that the trees around
him suddenly flower out of season, in celebration. If pain can be felt,
celebration can also be felt. Just a few steps more and science will be
saying, “Yes, this is not a fiction.” Life sometimes is stranger than
fiction. It is.</p><p><br></p><p>HIS FATHER SAID TO HIM ONE DAY: I HEAR THE SEAGULLS ALL COME ROAMING
WITH YOU – BRING ME SOME TO PLAY WITH.</p><p><br></p><p>Now an idea had entered the head. The man was no longer the same.
Love was not there. The heart was not functioning that day. A desire had
entered. He had a target now. He had come to the seashore now with a
business. He was no more a friend to the seagulls – he was going to
catch them – he was the enemy.</p><p><br></p><p>NEXT DAY, WHEN HE WENT DOWN TO THE SEA, THE SEAGULLS DANCED OVER HIM
AND WOULD NOT COME DOWN.</p><p><br></p><p>The seagulls cannot understand what you are thinking in the mind but
they can understand the vibes that you are creating around – and you are
continuously creating vibes around you. You are a continuous broadcast
of vibes, CONTINUOUS. Whatsoever happens in your heart, it is just as
if</p><p>someone has thrown a stone in a lake: ripples arise, and they go on
and on and on – they will go to the very end, to the very shore, all
around. A feeling arises in you; immediately a stone has been thrown in
the lake of your being. An idea arises in you – ripples arise. They go
all around.</p><p><br></p><p>Those seagulls don’t know exactly what the father has said to the
son, because they don’t understand the local language of man. They don’t
know what has really happened, but deep down they still know that this
man is not the same. Somebody else has come, a stranger, not the old
friend. Now he has come with an idea. The idea is not known, but
throughout his whole body he is now not in a letgo. He has some idea to
DO, some plan, some desire. He is not the same relaxed man with whom
seagulls could feel at home.</p><p><br></p><p>And this is the secret of the whole of life: not only seagulls but
happiness, meditation, ecstasy – they all come to you when you are in a
total letgo, in a deeply friendly mood, in a loving attitude towards
existence. When you are at the heart, they come. When you are persuading
them, and you think that happiness is something like a right, that you
have to pursue it, suddenly the seagulls of happiness are not
descending. They will dance above your head but they will never come
down to play with you, to move with you, to jump and hop! No, they will
never become one with you. They will not descend into your being.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, happiness is a seagull. Meditation also is a seagull. Ecstasy is
also a seagull. Existence understands only letgo. If you are in a letgo,
you will attain. You will attain to whatsoever this existence can give
you – and it can give you infinite blessings, infinite benediction. It
can give you total satiety, contentment. You can become a buddha.</p><p><br></p><p>Existence is ready to give, but you are not ready to take it, because
you are thinking in terms of how to snatch it. Existence gives to you as
gifts; you cannot snatch, you cannot conquer, you cannot achieve. You
surrender, please. Please, be in a letgo.</p><p><br></p><p>All that is beautiful is like seagulls. Remember this: nothing can be
done. The feast is already ready – you have been invited. You can enter
from the front door. But you are foolish, you are trying to enter from
the back door, and in existence there is no back door. You are trying to
enter like a thief. The front door is open for you, and the host is
waiting on the steps to receive you, and you are trying to enter from
the back door like a thief.</p><p><br></p><p>Life has no back doors. You cannot steal life. You cannot be a thief.
Life gives, and gives infinitely and gives unconditionally. You please
be just in a letgo. Let the seagulls descend and play with you, and
loiter with you on the seashore. Everything is ready. The feast, the
host – everything is ready, just waiting for you to come in from the
front door. Effort is not needed. Effort is the back door.
Effortlessness is needed.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t listen to Jefferson. Happiness is not a right, you cannot
pursue it. You have to persuade it. It is like a shy woman: you have to
court it, indirectly. You don’t go to a woman and say, “I would like to
go to bed with you.” That is too direct, too insulting, too vulgar. Any
worthwhile woman would slap your face. One has to be a little more
subtle with a woman. One has to be a little more indirect.</p><p><br></p><p>Patience is needed. Poetry is needed. And even if you have the idea
in your mind to go to bed, that will be a disturbance, that will create
an unbridgeable gap. If the idea is not there then you simply</p><p>enjoy being with this woman. One day you will go to bed with her, but
that will happen. The seagulls will descend on you.</p><p><br></p><p>Let life happen, don’t try to force it. Through doing, only worthless
things are achieved; through nondoing – all that is beautiful, all that
is sacred, all that is divine.</p><p><br></p><p>Enough for today.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part6>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

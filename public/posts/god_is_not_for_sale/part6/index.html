It means the conqueror of one’s own being. Literally it means the conqueror. And deva means divine – one who has become a god, or divine, by conquering himself. And there are only two possibilities to conquer: either you conquer others or you conquer yourself. Those who conquer others ultimately come to know that their whole effort has been in vain. They have simply lost their soul and nothing has been attained. Their hands are empty in the end. They come empty, they go empty. And their whole life is nothing but a tale told by an idiot, full of fury and noise, signifying nothing. They make much noise certainly, they create much trouble certainly, they make much news certainly – but the whole story is just a tale told by an idiot.\nThe wise man tries to conquer his own being. The wise man’s kingdom is his own being. He wants to become the emperor, not of others, not of things, not of anything that is outside, but of all that belongs to his inner being.\nDeva means divine, and uruvara means fertility, creativity, possibility – a divine possibility. And that’s everybody’s possibility. We never claim it; our treasure remains unclaimed. We never ask for that which is already given to us – and of course we never use it. We are emperors who somehow have come to believe themselves to be beggars. So this has to be remembered by you – that each moment of life has to be fertile. Never miss a single moment without being creative.\nThe total result is God. God is not something that happens somewhere, some day. It happens in small bits and pieces. The total result is God. So it has to happen each and every day. In fact each moment of life has to become fertile and creative. So just remember that. Don’t kill time as people are doing all over the world. Killing time means committing suicide. Killing time means killing the possibility in which you could have grown. And unless you try to grow, it is not going to happen.\nNature has brought you up to a certain point from where the growth has to be taken into your own hands. Nature has brought you to be a human being; more than that is not the capacity of nature.\nUp to the human being there is evolution. Beyond humanity there is revolution. Evolution means that which has been happening in spite of you; you were just riding on the wave. But there comes a moment – and humanity is that moment, that boundary line – if you don’t start moving on your own you are stuck. The wave of nature has brought you to the very maximum, optimum limit. More than that is not possible. Now you have to travel, and you have to make effort; you have to be creative. And when I say creative, I don’t mean just painting, poetry, sculpture – no. These are very ordinary creativities.\nYou create a painting or you create a poem or a song but you don’t create yourself. The poet remains as unfulfilled as the non-poet and the painter remains as empty as the non-painter. The painter may have painted a beautiful picture but he has remained as ugly as anybody else. So if you love some poet’s poetry don’t go to see the poet; otherwise you will be frustrated. The poetry may be beautiful, but when you go to the poet you will find an ordinary human being – even sometimes more ordinary than the ordinary ones. If you love a painting, love it and forget the painter. Never go to see the painter – otherwise you will be frustrated. You may find a crazy man or a maniac... because they have been creating something, certainly, but they have completely forgotten that the basic and the most primary creativity has to be concerned with one’s own being.\nYou have to be creative about your own being. You have to give birth to your self. That’s what sannyas is all about.\n[A sannyasin says: I am pregnant and I want to ask you if I can be a good mother and if the child can be okay.\n... I wanted a baby so much; that’s why I don’t know. Maybe I’m not strong enough – that’s why I wanted to ask you.\nOsho checks here energy.]\nYou have a very great desire to be a mother. So be, mm? But be knowing that you are taking on a great responsibility. To become a mother is one of the greatest responsibilities in the world. So many people are on the psychiatrists’ couches and so many people are in madhouses and so many are out of the madhouses. If you go deep into the neurosis of humanity you will always find the mother, because so many women want to be mothers but they don’t know how to be. Once the relationship between the mother and the child goes wrong the child’s whole life goes wrong, because that is his first contact with the world, his first relationship. Everything else will be in continuity with it. And if the first step goes wrong, the whole life goes wrong.\nThe desire is there – I can feel it... a tremendous desire to be a mother. Nothing is wrong in it, but one should knowingly become a mother. You are taking one of the greatest responsibilities that a human being can take. Men are a little freer in that way because they cannot take the responsibility of becoming a mother. Women have more responsibility. So become a mother, but don’t take it for granted that just by being a woman one is necessarily a mother – that is a fallacy. Motherhood is a great art; you have to learn it. So start learning about it!\nA few things I would like to say to you. First, never treat the child as yours; never possess the child. It comes through you but it is not yours. God has only used you as a vehicle, a medium, but the child\nis not your possession. Love, but never possess the child. If the mother starts possessing the child then the life is destroyed. The child starts becoming a prisoner. You are destroying his personality and you are reducing him to a thing. Only a thing can be possessed: a house can be possessed, a car can be possessed – never a person. So this is the first lesson – get ready for it. Before the child comes you should be able to greet him as an independent being, as a person in his own right, not just your child.\nAnd the second thing: treat the child as you would treat a grown-up person. Never treat a child like a child. Treat the child with deep respect. God has chosen you to be a host. God has entered into your being as a guest The child is very fragile, helpless. It is very difficult to respect the child. It is very easy to humiliate the child. Humiliation comes very easy because the child is helpless and cannot do anything, cannot retaliate, cannot react.\nTreat the child as a grown-up, and with great respect. Once you respect the child, you don’t try to impose your ideas on him. You don’t try to impose anything on the child. You simply give him the freedom – freedom to explore the world. You help him to become more and more powerful in exploring the world but you never give him directions. You give him energy, you give him protection, you give him security, all that he needs, but you help him to go farther away from you to explore the world.\nAnd of course in freedom the wrong is also included. It is very difficult for a mother to learn that when you give freedom to a child it is not freedom only to do good. It is also necessarily the freedom to do bad, to do wrong. So make the child alert, intelligent, but never give him any commandments – nobody keeps them, and people become hypocrites. So if you really love the child, the one thing has to be remembered: never, never help him in any way, force him in any way, to become a hypocrite.\nAnd the third thing: don’t listen to the morality, don’t listen to religion, don’t listen to culture – listen to nature. Whatsoever is natural is good – even if sometimes it is very difficult for you, very uncomfortable for you. Because you have been not brought up according to nature. Your parents were not bringing you up with real art, love. It was just an accidental thing. Don’t repeat the same mistakes. Many times you will feel very uneasy.…\nFor example a small child starts playing with his sexual organs. The natural tendency of the mother is to stop the child because she has been taught that this is wrong. Even if she feels that nothing is wrong, if somebody is there she feels a little embarrassed. Feel embarrassed!\nThat is your problem; that has nothing to do with the child. Feel embarrassed. Even if you lose respectability in society, lose – but never interfere with the child. Let nature take its own course. You are there to facilitate whatsoever nature is unfolding. You are not to direct nature. You are just to be there as a help.\nSo these three things... and start meditating. Before the child is born you should go as deeply as possible in meditation. When the child is within your womb, whatsoever you are doing continuously goes as a vibration to the child. If you are angry, your stomach has a tension of anger. The child immediately feels it. When you are sad, your stomach has an atmosphere of sadness. Immediately the child feels dull, depressed. The child totally depends on you. Whatsoever is your mood is the mood of the child. The child has no independence right now: your climate is his climate. So no more\nfighting, no more anger. That’s why I say that to be a mother is a great responsibility. You will have to sacrifice much.\nNow during these coming seven months you have to be very very alert. The child is more important than anything else. If somebody insults you, accept it, but don’t get angry. Say, ‘I am pregnant, and the child is more important than getting angry at you. This episode will pass and after a few days I will not remember who has insulted me and what I have done. But the child is going to be there at least seventy, eighty years in the world. It is a big project.’ Even if you want, note it down in the diary. When the child is born, then you can be angry, but not right now. Just say, ‘I am a pregnant mother. I cannot be angry – that is not allowed.’ This is what I call sensitive understanding.\nNo more sadness, no more anger, no more hatred, no more fighting with Anand Veda. Both have to look to the child. When a child is there you are both secondary; the child has every preference. Because a new life is going to be born... and it is going to be your fruit. If from the very beginning anger, hatred, conflict, enters into the child’s mind, then you are causing hell for him. He will suffer. Then it is better not to bring a child into the world. Why bring a child into suffering? The world is tremendous suffering.\nIn the first place bringing a child into this world is a very risky affair. But even if you want that, at least bring a child who will be totally different in this world – who will not be miserable, who will at least help the world to be a little more celebrating. He will bring a little more festivity into the world... a little more laughter, love, life.\nSo for these days, be celebrating. Dance, sing, listen to music, meditate, love. Be very soft. Don’t do anything hectic, in a hurry. Don’t do anything in a tension. Just go slowly. Slow down absolutely. A great guest is to come – you have to receive him. Good, be a mother! Good.\n[A sannyasin says: I tried to run away several times from you.]\nThat’s a good sign. Those who are in love with me, they always try! But there is no way: the more you try, the more you will be caught. One can never escape from love. It is impossible; it just does not happen. If I love you, how can you escape? I know that when there is love a fear arises – a great fear arises in the being – because you start losing your individuality, your ego, your definition. Love is a sure super-kill. So one becomes apprehensive. One tries to protect oneself – and naturally. The instinct is there to protect oneself.\nBut when you go away, when you try to go away, you find it impossible, because now you see that even if you can have your ego, it is worthless. Dying in love is better than living without love. Dying in love is better than laughing without love. It is even better to be in hell if you are in love, than to be in heaven without love. Once you have tasted love, you become an addict. I make addicts out of you. And yet there is no remedy for it – no antidote exists.\nBut it is good! It simply shows a strong person – that one tries to escape. I enjoy it!\n[The sannyasin adds: And it’s got deeper – my relationship with you... and consequently my relationship to everything.]\nWith everything it deepens. If it deepens at one point, it deepens at all points. If you can love a single person you have fallen in love with the whole universe. The one person becomes the door, becomes the opening. A real love, whenever it happens, is always a love for the all. Of course one becomes the triggering point, that’s all. Then by and by it is a chain, and one after another doors open.\n[The sannyasin says: I have a home, a physical home... and I want to be free of it because I identify with it, you know. I really have a security attached to it.]\nMm. All attachments become sooner or later burdens on the soul, and it is always good to get free. Whenever you start getting attached with something too much, take it as an indication that now it is time to get out of it. Otherwise the thing will become more important than you. Use things, but never be used by anything, because if you possess things too much, for too long, they start possessing you. The possessor himself becomes the possessed.\nSo you simply go. It will need courage, but I have an absolute feeling that the courage is there, and you will be able to do whatsoever you want to do. The fear will be there, problems will be there – naturally – but in spite of them, whatsoever you want to do you will be able to do. I would not have said this one month before; then you were wavering very much. Now you have become centred, you have found a centre within your being. If you had asked me one month before, I would have told you to wait a little more, not to go so early. But now you can go.\nIt will be good if you finish everything, mm, so you can be totally here. I need you here. And while you are there, put my crazy ideas into a few people’s minds. mm? Good! (chuckle) Good.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2690","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/god_is_not_for_sale/part6/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/god_is_not_for_sale/>God Is Not For Sale</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">6</h1><div class=post-meta>13 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2690 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/God_Is_Not_For_Sale/part6.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part5>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

conqueror of one’s own being. Literally it means the conqueror. And deva
means divine – one who has become a god, or divine, by conquering
himself. And there are only two possibilities to conquer: either you
conquer others or you conquer yourself. Those who conquer others
ultimately come to know that their whole effort has been in vain. They
have simply lost their soul and nothing has been attained. Their hands

difficult to respect the child. It is very easy to humiliate the child.
Humiliation comes very easy because the child is helpless and cannot do
anything, cannot retaliate, cannot react.</p><p><br></p><p>Treat the child as a grown-up, and with great respect. Once you
respect the child, you don’t try to impose your ideas on him. You don’t
try to impose anything on the child. You simply give him the freedom –
freedom to explore the world. You help him to become more and more
powerful in exploring the world but you never give him directions. You
give him energy, you give him protection, you give him security, all
that he needs, but you help him to go farther away from you to explore
the world.</p><p><br></p><p>And of course in freedom the wrong is also included. It is very
difficult for a mother to learn that when you give freedom to a child it
is not freedom only to do good. It is also necessarily the freedom to do
bad, to do wrong. So make the child alert, intelligent, but never give
him any commandments – nobody keeps them, and people become hypocrites.
So if you really love the child, the one thing has to be remembered:
never, never help him in any way, force him in any way, to become a
hypocrite.</p><p><br></p><p>And the third thing: don’t listen to the morality, don’t listen to
religion, don’t listen to culture – listen to nature. Whatsoever is
natural is good – even if sometimes it is very difficult for you, very
uncomfortable for you. Because you have been not brought up according to
nature. Your parents were not bringing you up with real art, love. It
was just an accidental thing. Don’t repeat the same mistakes. Many times
you will feel very uneasy.…</p><p><br></p><p>For example a small child starts playing with his sexual organs. The
natural tendency of the mother is to stop the child because she has been
taught that this is wrong. Even if she feels that nothing is wrong, if
somebody is there she feels a little embarrassed. Feel embarrassed!</p><p><br></p><p>That is your problem; that has nothing to do with the child. Feel
embarrassed. Even if you lose respectability in society, lose – but
never interfere with the child. Let nature take its own course. You are
there to facilitate whatsoever nature is unfolding. You are not to
direct nature. You are just to be there as a help.</p><p><br></p><p>So these three things... and start meditating. Before the child is
born you should go as deeply as possible in meditation. When the child
is within your womb, whatsoever you are doing continuously goes as a
vibration to the child. If you are angry, your stomach has a tension of
anger. The child immediately feels it. When you are sad, your stomach
has an atmosphere of sadness. Immediately the child feels dull,
depressed. The child totally depends on you. Whatsoever is your mood is
the mood of the child. The child has no independence right now: your
climate is his climate. So no more</p><p>fighting, no more anger. That’s why I say that to be a mother is a
great responsibility. You will have to sacrifice much.</p><p><br></p><p>Now during these coming seven months you have to be very very alert.
The child is more important than anything else. If somebody insults you,
accept it, but don’t get angry. Say, ‘I am pregnant, and the child is
more important than getting angry at you. This episode will pass and
after a few days I will not remember who has insulted me and what I have
done. But the child is going to be there at least seventy, eighty years
in the world. It is a big project.’ Even if you want, note it down in
the diary. When the child is born, then you can be angry, but not right
now. Just say, ‘I am a pregnant mother. I cannot be angry – that is not
allowed.’ This is what I call sensitive understanding.</p><p><br></p><p>No more sadness, no more anger, no more hatred, no more fighting with
Anand Veda. Both have to look to the child. When a child is there you
are both secondary; the child has every preference. Because a new life
is going to be born... and it is going to be your fruit. If from the
very beginning anger, hatred, conflict, enters into the child’s mind,
then you are causing hell for him. He will suffer. Then it is better not
to bring a child into the world. Why bring a child into suffering? The
world is tremendous suffering.</p><p><br></p><p>In the first place bringing a child into this world is a very risky
affair. But even if you want that, at least bring a child who will be
totally different in this world – who will not be miserable, who will at
least help the world to be a little more celebrating. He will bring a
little more festivity into the world... a little more laughter, love,
life.</p><p><br></p><p>So for these days, be celebrating. Dance, sing, listen to music,
meditate, love. Be very soft. Don’t do anything hectic, in a hurry.
Don’t do anything in a tension. Just go slowly. Slow down absolutely. A
great guest is to come – you have to receive him. Good, be a mother!
Good.</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin says: I tried to run away several times from you.]</p><p><br></p><p>That’s a good sign. Those who are in love with me, they always try!
But there is no way: the more you try, the more you will be caught. One
can never escape from love. It is impossible; it just does not happen.
If I love you, how can you escape? I know that when there is love a fear
arises – a great fear arises in the being – because you start losing
your individuality, your ego, your definition. Love is a sure
super-kill. So one becomes apprehensive. One tries to protect oneself –
and naturally. The instinct is there to protect oneself.</p><p><br></p><p>But when you go away, when you try to go away, you find it
impossible, because now you see that even if you can have your ego, it
is worthless. Dying in love is better than living without love. Dying in
love is better than laughing without love. It is even better to be in
hell if you are in love, than to be in heaven without love. Once you
have tasted love, you become an addict. I make addicts out of you. And
yet there is no remedy for it – no antidote exists.</p><p><br></p><p>But it is good! It simply shows a strong person – that one tries to
escape. I enjoy it!</p><p><br></p><p>[The sannyasin adds: And it’s got deeper – my relationship with
you... and consequently my relationship to everything.]</p><p>With everything it deepens. If it deepens at one point, it deepens at
all points. If you can love a single person you have fallen in love with
the whole universe. The one person becomes the door, becomes the
opening. A real love, whenever it happens, is always a love for the all.
Of course one becomes the triggering point, that’s all. Then by and by
it is a chain, and one after another doors open.</p><p><br></p><p>[The sannyasin says: I have a home, a physical home... and I want to
be free of it because I identify with it, you know. I really have a
security attached to it.]</p><p><br></p><p>Mm. All attachments become sooner or later burdens on the soul, and
it is always good to get free. Whenever you start getting attached with
something too much, take it as an indication that now it is time to get
out of it. Otherwise the thing will become more important than you. Use
things, but never be used by anything, because if you possess things too
much, for too long, they start possessing you. The possessor himself
becomes the possessed.</p><p><br></p><p>So you simply go. It will need courage, but I have an absolute
feeling that the courage is there, and you will be able to do whatsoever
you want to do. The fear will be there, problems will be there –
naturally – but in spite of them, whatsoever you want to do you will be
able to do. I would not have said this one month before; then you were
wavering very much. Now you have become centred, you have found a centre
within your being. If you had asked me one month before, I would have
told you to wait a little more, not to go so early. But now you can
go.</p><p><br></p><p>It will be good if you finish everything, mm, so you can be totally
here. I need you here. And while you are there, put my crazy ideas into
a few people’s minds. mm? Good! (chuckle) Good.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part5>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

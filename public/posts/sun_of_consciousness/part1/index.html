It is for research only.]\nMy Beloved Ones,\nLast year, in a world conference of biologists, the president of the British Biological Association, Badkun(?), gave a statement. I want to begin today’s talk with that statement. He said a very significant thing in that statement. He said that the evolution of human life is not the addition of anything new to it, but the falling down of some old hindrances. In the evolution of man, nothing gets added, only what is hidden in man becomes manifest. Only the hindrances, in between, get put aside. If you compare man and animal, the man has nothing more than the animal; rather he has less. The hindrances that animals have, have fallen off in the man and what is dormant in animals has manifested in the man.\nBetween a seed and its flower, the flower does not have anything more than the seed, rather it has less. It appears very contradictory but this is the truth. The hindrances that were in the seed, have dropped and the flower has manifested.\nCompared to the animals, the plants have more hindrances in them. If they fall away, the plants will become animals. If the hindrances of animals fall away, the animals will become man. If the hindrances of man drop, then whatever is left, is called God. If all hindrances drop, all that is dormant becomes manifest completely, then whatever name we want to give to that energy soul, God or anything or even if we do not want to give it a name, that will do. Man has yet hindrances in him and hence there is possibility of his growth. Badkun has nothing to do with spirituality but his statement is exactly like that; that twenty five centuries ago Buddha gave after his enlightenment.\n2\nThe day Buddha was enlightened, people asked him,“What have you attained?” Buddha said, “I have attained nothing, what was already within me has become manifest, has become known to me. I have attained nothing, what I was already and I was asleep to it I have awakened to it.” Buddha also said,“I want to say to you even this that there was ignorance and it is lost, there was nonsense and it is lost and what I have attained, now I can say that I already had it, only I was unaware of it.\nThere is no difference in the statements of Badkun and Buddha. But Badkun’s statement is given in reference to species that are behind man, and Buddha’s statement has been given in reference to the Individual who has gone ahead of man. The process of meditation does not take you to some new world it only introduces you to the world where you have been for lives upon lives. The process of meditation does not add anything to you, it only takes away what is wrong; cuts it away, sheds it off.\nSomeone was saying to a sculptor that you have made this statue very beautiful. The sculptor said, “I have not made it. I was only passing through that way and the statue in this stone called me. I have only cut away the unwanted parts of the stone that were there and the statue has appeared. I have not added anything, I have only lessened something.\nIf one cuts away the wrong which is in man, becomes what is hidden in him manifests. God is nothing different from to man. It is the name of the energy hidden in the man. But as we are, there is a lot of clay mixed with the gold. If the clay is removed, the gold becomes manifest.\nSo about meditation, the first thing that I have to say to you is that what you will be in the last moments of your growth in meditation, that you already are, here and now. Meditation will not add anything to you but it will remove some things. It will cut away some wrong from you. It will destroy somethings that are not wanted and what is significant, that will get the opportunity to manifest totally. Nothing new will be added, only old hindrances will be dropped. The experiments that we are going to do in these four days in order to drop these hindrances, they are very vital, very alive experiments. And all those who will be ready to do it honestly, for them results are certain to happen. It will be good to understand what I mean by the word “honesty”.\nWhat I mean by “honesty” is that those who will really experiment; for them the result is certain. Only those will have no results who would not do it. And the results cannot be expected of them either. I am not asking of you any other ability. No, no other qualification is needed. Only one qualification is required, that what I am going to say to you during these four days, you will do it. And what I am going to say for you to do, it is not difficult, it is simple. Even small children can do it. Hence you need not think that it may be so difficult that you are unable to do it. No, if there will be any difficulty, that can be only in being insincere to yourself, it cannot be in the technique itself. Even a small child who understands language can do it. So I explain to you the experiment. It’s very simple.\nAll significant things are simple. It is the insignificant things that are complex and difficult. All truths are simple, it is the untruth that is complex.\nBut we are strange people! If something seems very complex and difficult we think it must be some very profound truth, some very deep truth. It is not so. All truths of life are as simple as two and two make four. Only untruths are difficult. The untruth has to be difficult, because if it is simple it will be caught that it is untrue. The untruth has to move into circles and through cunningness so that\nit cannot be found to be untruth. Truth stands just straight and naked. As it is, so it is. There’s no need for it to hide or change faces. This is why all the difficult things that have been said in the world are generally untruths. All the true things that have been said in the world, are generally simple and straightforward. Be it Upanishads, be it Geeta, be it Koran, be it Bible or be it the words of Buddha or Mahavira, they are simple like two and two making four.\nThis experiment that I am to tell you is very simple. It brings amazing results. In this experiment there are four stages of ten minutes each. In the first three stages, you are to do something and in the fourth stage, you do not have to do anything. You have only to wait for God’s energy to do something. In the first stage, the experiment involves ten minutes of fast breathing. For ten minutes you have to breathe in such a manner as a blacksmith’s bellows blows. You have to breathe as fast as you can, the breathing has to hit as deeply as possible. Breathing has to be used like bellows. Firstly, the life-energy dormant within us awakens when breathing hits hard. Perhaps you may not be knowing that in our bodies not only in our body, the energy which is dormant in all forms of life, is nothing but a form of electricity. The energy with which our bodies are functioning is also a form of electricity. This organic electricity is the life-energy. The more oxygen this electricity gets, the more intensely it awakens. This is why people have died without oxygen, but even if one is just on the verge of death and oxygen is given to him he can be kept alive for some time at least.\nIn these ten minutes, you have to inhale with such force that all the air inside your body goes out and fresh air of the outside goes in. The proportion of oxygen in your body has to be changed. It changes on its own. And the hit of the breathing has to be so forceful that energy which is asleep in the body starts awakening. Within five minutes of this experiment, in the bodies of at least sixty percent people vibrations will begin. You will feel it very clearly that something has begun vibrating and rising upwards. Yoga has called it Kundalini. If we ask science it will call it body-electricity. It will say this is the electricity of body.\nThere is a man in America with whose body-electricity very amazing experiments have been done. His body electricity is more than what is usual. He did some special experiments on breathing and then he took a five watt bulb in his hand which became lit. In Sweden, there is one woman still alive, no one can touch her. She could not be married because in touching her, one gets the same shock as one gets from the electricity. These few people have specially extra electricity in their bodies and there may be some chemical differences, hence the results are so strong. But there is electricity in everyone’s body. Now on the very first day you will see the results on sixty percent people. It can happen to hundred percent people there is no reason why it cannot. But forty percent people, generally, do not participate and keep standing behind. This has been my observation and therefore I am talking of sixty percent. But I will say to each of you to be amongst the sixty percent and not amongst forty percent.\nOnly after five minutes, you will feel something in your body has begun vibrating and rising up. You will feel that the body is getting filled with a new energy. By the time you have completed ten minutes of this experiment, you will be in an electrified state. The whole body will become a flow of energy. Naturally it will have its effects. When there will be forceful vibrations in the body, the body will start shaking, moving, dancing.\nThe second stage of the experiment is also of ten minutes in which one has to allow the body totally to shake, dance or do anything that it wants to do. Its results are cathartic. We have suppressed\nour bodies in a thousand and one ways. We have also suppressed our minds in many many ways. The person who wants to go in meditation, has first to be free of these suppressions. We have suppressed anger. We have suppressed desires. We have suppressed worries. There are thousand and one things we have suppressed in our minds. When we wanted to weep, we have not wept; when we wanted to laugh, we have not laughed; when we wanted to shout, we have not shouted; when we wanted to dance, we have not danced. All that we have kept suppressed. There are thousand and one kinds of suppressions in the mind as well as in the body. Unless those repressions are dropped, mind cannot be light enough to be in meditation. Hence in the second ten minutes, you have to cooperate fully with the body and allow it total freedom. If the body wants to dance, allow it to dance totally; if the body wants to shout, allow it to shout totally; if the body wants to cry, allow it to cry totally. Whatever the body wants to do – only with your body, not with others’ bodies - whatever it wants to do, allow it total freedom and cooperation.\nAbout sixty percent people will suddenly find a lot happening within themselves. To most of the people it will happen on its own, no problem for them; but the friends who feel that nothing is happening to them on its own, it is only because they are so strong in their suppressions that the layer in between is not allowing them to reach inside. I will say to them not to bother about it. It is not happening to them, even then whatever they can do, they should do for the ten minutes. If they can manage to dance, they should keep dancing. It is not a question of any method, rhythm or technique. If they can shout, they should remain shouting. Tomorrow itself, they will find that there is a breakthrough and from there has started to come out all bitterness spontaneously. The effects of these ten minutes are very deep. After these ten minutes of dancing, shanting, shaking, laughing you will become so light as perhaps you have never been before in your life.\nThe electricity that awakens in your body in the first stage will help you in dancing, shouting, crying and laughing. You also have to cooperate from your side and whatever comes from within has to be totally allowed to happen. If your hands are shaking even a little bit, you make them shake totally so that whatever impulses are suppressed in them get released, catharted. Through this experiment so much can happen in these four days which cannot happen even in four years through any other common experiment.\nAfter the second stage your body will feel weightless, as if it has become absolutely light, as if it can fly. Twofold things will be felt. After the first stage, the body will be felt to be full of energy. After the second stage, energy will be full there but the body would have become weightless and light. After the second stage, you will clearly feel it that there is no body but only an energy.\nIn this second stage, an amazing phenomenon will be experienced by those who have really been total with the experiment and that is, for the first time they will start feeling that body is separate and I am separate. If you let go of your body totally, your identity [with the body] will be broken. This can happen today. The only condition is that you cooperate with it totally, that you prevent nothing on your part. You are not to think that when you will dance or shout what will someone else say. Whatever is happening from inside you, you let it happen, you do not worry about it. And then in this ten minutes, what you have always heard and read that body and you are separate will become part of your experience. You will see the dancing body separate from you, you will become a witness that the body is weeping. You will be able to see very clearly that someone else is laughing and I am witnessing. This realization is a necessary door for taking one deep into meditation. Without this, no one can be in meditation.\nIn the third stage when this experience would have happened in the second stage that the body is separate and I am separate, there will arise a natural question then as to who am I? Up til now I thought that I was the body, I was the breathing, now body and breathing are appearing separate from me – then who am I? In this third stage we will ask within ourselves - who am I?\nIn the first ten minutes fast and wild breathing, in the second ten minutes absolute cooperation with the body, and in the third ten minutes, the intense query: ‘Who am I?’ You have to ask within yourselves so vigorously that from toe to head, only one question starts echoing:‘Who am I?’ And the waves of electricity that must have been awakened by now, will catch your question and will start echoing in the vibrations of the whole body -’ who am I?’ You have to ask so quickly that there is no space between two ’who am I?’s. You have to ask it with such force that there is no time, energy or convenience left for thinking anything else. So, for ten minutes only one question remains. After five minutes of intense questioning inside, to many friends it would have taken over loudly on the outside. There is nothing to be worried about it.\nIn the beginning, ‘who am I?’ is to be asked within. If it starts coming outside, as a shouting, let it come out. Nothing to worry about. In thirty minutes your body will be tired, your vitality will be tired, your mind-energy will be tired. These three stages will make the three forces tired. And in the thirty minutes you have to reach to such a climax of tension, you have to do all this in thirty minutes so vigorously that now even if you want to shout, you would not be able to, you would remain silent. If you go on asking ‘who am I?’ slowly like a dead man then that momentum would not be created which is essential. The water has to be boiled to 100 degrees to evaporate into vapor. It does not evaporate at 98 degrees, nor at 99 degrees. You cannot say to God that just for one degree why this stubbornness. It has come to 99 degrees, please make it vapor, it is a matter of only one degree. It has come upto 99 degrees, why are you being so miserly just for one degree? But such things make no difference. The water will evaporate into vapor only at 100 degrees. If you stop even at 99 degrees, evaporating into vapor is a far away thing, the water will gradually become cold again.\nExactly like this, in each individual there is a point of climax from where the upward movement of life energies begins, from where the revolution begins, from where the mutation begins. If you do not reach to that 100 degrees point, where man dissolves and God begins, you will fall back to zero and the whole effort will be wasted. It will have no meaning. Hence I will ask you that whatever I am saying, do it honestly and see. See what it can do. Experiment for four days and see it for yourself. Those who will experiment honestly, will attain to trust. Trust is not required beforehand. You need not believe that what I am saying will surely happen. You accept only this much that this man is saying something, let us experiment and see. If something happens, fine, if nothing happens, know that it was wrong. But if you did, the happening is as certain as the water evaporating at 100 degrees. Nobody needs to believe in it; water does not boil by any belief; you may be a non-believer, an atheist, it makes no difference; you boil the water and it will turn into vapor at 100 degrees.\nThe meditation I am talking about, is totally a scientific phenomenon. You may be an atheist, you may be a non-believer, you may be denying soul, you may be denying religion – no problem, there is no need to believe anything. You experiment and you will find inner changes happening through that experiment.\nTrust is the outcome of meditation, not a pre-requirement to it.\nLet me say a few things more before you stand up for the experiment. Those who may be sick or\nweak, they are to do the experiment sitting, all the rest will do the experiment standing. Standing, the results are quicker, sitting, the results are not that quick. All will stand up leaving enough space around. There is plenty of space here. So that if you are dancing, you do not collide with anybody. But if one may collide, do not be bothered by it.\nThere are two more things. Before the experiment begins, I will ask you to close your eyes and they are to remain closed for forty minutes. This will be your first firm resolve. This has to be fulfilled honestly. Even if you open the eyes once, you lose. The energy that would have accumulated within you, will be wasted. The Major part of our inner energy dissipates through our eyes. Hence eyes have to be kept completely closed for forty minutes. Until not give the suggestion, you are not to open your eyes. There will be shouting, crying, dancing around you and within you, you need not bother. There may arise a desire to look, because the child within us does not die so soon. This inside child does not die as fast as one’s body changes; he may desire to know what the next man is doing. For that purpose, I have called for a film crew. It will be ready today only, so we will show it at night and you can see completely who is doing what. So your curiosity will be satisfied. Hence you will not worry right now as to who is doing what. That you will be able to see in the film.\nOnlookers are not allowed to be here. If someone is here only to see, he should go outside the campus, or he may go far in the back, but no one will be here as a onlooker. Anyone who is not participating in the meditation experiment, has to leave. His presence will be a disturbance to all our friends. He has to leave. When you are meditating, the whole atmosphere is charged, and even one non-participant standing in the middle harms and breaks the chain of energy. Such a person is not needed here. Hence those who do not want to participate, will not stand here, they will leave quietly. Remove all the chairs from here, because someone may stumble on them and fall over. You get off the chairs and put them away.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"3681","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/sun_of_consciousness/part1/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/sun_of_consciousness/>Sun of Consciousness</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">1</h1><div class=post-meta>18 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;3681 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Sun_of_Consciousness/part1.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=_index>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

nothing, what I was already and I was asleep to it I have awakened to
it.” Buddha also said,“I want to say to you even this that there was
ignorance and it is lost, there was nonsense and it is lost and what I
have attained, now I can say that I already had it, only I was unaware
of it.</p><p><br></p><p>There is no difference in the statements of Badkun and Buddha. But
Badkun’s statement is given in reference to species that are behind man,
and Buddha’s statement has been given in reference to the Individual who
has gone ahead of man. The process of meditation does not take you to
some new world it only introduces you to the world where you have been
for lives upon lives. The process of meditation does not add anything to
you, it only takes away what is wrong; cuts it away, sheds it off.</p><p><br></p><p>Someone was saying to a sculptor that you have made this statue very
beautiful. The sculptor said, “I have not made it. I was only passing
through that way and the statue in this stone called me. I have only cut
away the unwanted parts of the stone that were there and the statue has
appeared. I have not added anything, I have only lessened something.</p><p><br></p><p>If one cuts away the wrong which is in man, becomes what is hidden in
him manifests. God is nothing different from to man. It is the name of
the energy hidden in the man. But as we are, there is a lot of clay
mixed with the gold. If the clay is removed, the gold becomes
manifest.</p><p><br></p><p>So about meditation, the first thing that I have to say to you is
that what you will be in the last moments of your growth in meditation,
that you already are, here and now. Meditation will not add anything to
you but it will remove some things. It will cut away some wrong from
you. It will destroy somethings that are not wanted and what is
significant, that will get the opportunity to manifest totally. Nothing
new will be added, only old hindrances will be dropped. The experiments
that we are going to do in these four days in order to drop these
hindrances, they are very vital, very alive experiments. And all those
who will be ready to do it honestly, for them results are certain to
happen. It will be good to understand what I mean by the word
“honesty”.</p><p><br></p><p>What I mean by “honesty” is that those who will really experiment;
for them the result is certain. Only those will have no results who
would not do it. And the results cannot be expected of them either. I am
not asking of you any other ability. No, no other qualification is
needed. Only one qualification is required, that what I am going to say
to you during these four days, you will do it. And what I am going to
say for you to do, it is not difficult, it is simple. Even small
children can do it. Hence you need not think that it may be so difficult
that you are unable to do it. No, if there will be any difficulty, that
can be only in being insincere to yourself, it cannot be in the
technique itself. Even a small child who understands language can do it.
So I explain to you the experiment. It’s very simple.</p><p><br></p><p>All significant things are simple. It is the insignificant things
that are complex and difficult. All truths are simple, it is the untruth
that is complex.</p><p><br></p><p>But we are strange people! If something seems very complex and
difficult we think it must be some very profound truth, some very deep
truth. It is not so. All truths of life are as simple as two and two
make four. Only untruths are difficult. The untruth has to be difficult,
because if it is simple it will be caught that it is untrue. The untruth
has to move into circles and through cunningness so that</p><p>it cannot be found to be untruth. Truth stands just straight and
naked. As it is, so it is. There’s no need for it to hide or change
faces. This is why all the difficult things that have been said in the
world are generally untruths. All the true things that have been said in
the world, are generally simple and straightforward. Be it Upanishads,
be it Geeta, be it Koran, be it Bible or be it the words of Buddha or
Mahavira, they are simple like two and two making four.</p><p><br></p><p>This experiment that I am to tell you is very simple. It brings
amazing results. In this experiment there are four stages of ten minutes
each. In the first three stages, you are to do something and in the
fourth stage, you do not have to do anything. You have only to wait for
God’s energy to do something. In the first stage, the experiment
involves ten minutes of fast breathing. For ten minutes you have to
breathe in such a manner as a blacksmith’s bellows blows. You have to
breathe as fast as you can, the breathing has to hit as deeply as
possible. Breathing has to be used like bellows. Firstly, the
life-energy dormant within us awakens when breathing hits hard. Perhaps
you may not be knowing that in our bodies not only in our body, the
energy which is dormant in all forms of life, is nothing but a form of
electricity. The energy with which our bodies are functioning is also a
form of electricity. This organic electricity is the life-energy. The
more oxygen this electricity gets, the more intensely it awakens. This
is why people have died without oxygen, but even if one is just on the
verge of death and oxygen is given to him he can be kept alive for some
time at least.</p><p><br></p><p>In these ten minutes, you have to inhale with such force that all the
air inside your body goes out and fresh air of the outside goes in. The
proportion of oxygen in your body has to be changed. It changes on its
own. And the hit of the breathing has to be so forceful that energy
which is asleep in the body starts awakening. Within five minutes of
this experiment, in the bodies of at least sixty percent people
vibrations will begin. You will feel it very clearly that something has
begun vibrating and rising upwards. Yoga has called it Kundalini. If we
ask science it will call it body-electricity. It will say this is the
electricity of body.</p><p><br></p><p>There is a man in America with whose body-electricity very amazing
experiments have been done. His body electricity is more than what is
usual. He did some special experiments on breathing and then he took a
five watt bulb in his hand which became lit. In Sweden, there is one
woman still alive, no one can touch her. She could not be married
because in touching her, one gets the same shock as one gets from the
electricity. These few people have specially extra electricity in their
bodies and there may be some chemical differences, hence the results are
so strong. But there is electricity in everyone’s body. Now on the very
first day you will see the results on sixty percent people. It can
happen to hundred percent people there is no reason why it cannot. But
forty percent people, generally, do not participate and keep standing
behind. This has been my observation and therefore I am talking of sixty
percent. But I will say to each of you to be amongst the sixty percent
and not amongst forty percent.</p><p><br></p><p>Only after five minutes, you will feel something in your body has
begun vibrating and rising up. You will feel that the body is getting
filled with a new energy. By the time you have completed ten minutes of
this experiment, you will be in an electrified state. The whole body
will become a flow of energy. Naturally it will have its effects. When
there will be forceful vibrations in the body, the body will start
shaking, moving, dancing.</p><p><br></p><p>The second stage of the experiment is also of ten minutes in which
one has to allow the body totally to shake, dance or do anything that it
wants to do. Its results are cathartic. We have suppressed</p><p>our bodies in a thousand and one ways. We have also suppressed our
minds in many many ways. The person who wants to go in meditation, has
first to be free of these suppressions. We have suppressed anger. We
have suppressed desires. We have suppressed worries. There are thousand
and one things we have suppressed in our minds. When we wanted to weep,
we have not wept; when we wanted to laugh, we have not laughed; when we
wanted to shout, we have not shouted; when we wanted to dance, we have
not danced. All that we have kept suppressed. There are thousand and one
kinds of suppressions in the mind as well as in the body. Unless those
repressions are dropped, mind cannot be light enough to be in
meditation. Hence in the second ten minutes, you have to cooperate fully
with the body and allow it total freedom. If the body wants to dance,
allow it to dance totally; if the body wants to shout, allow it to shout
totally; if the body wants to cry, allow it to cry totally. Whatever the
body wants to do – only with your body, not with others’ bodies -
whatever it wants to do, allow it total freedom and cooperation.</p><p><br></p><p>About sixty percent people will suddenly find a lot happening within
themselves. To most of the people it will happen on its own, no problem
for them; but the friends who feel that nothing is happening to them on
its own, it is only because they are so strong in their suppressions
that the layer in between is not allowing them to reach inside. I will
say to them not to bother about it. It is not happening to them, even
then whatever they can do, they should do for the ten minutes. If they
can manage to dance, they should keep dancing. It is not a question of
any method, rhythm or technique. If they can shout, they should remain
shouting. Tomorrow itself, they will find that there is a breakthrough
and from there has started to come out all bitterness spontaneously. The
effects of these ten minutes are very deep. After these ten minutes of
dancing, shanting, shaking, laughing you will become so light as perhaps
you have never been before in your life.</p><p><br></p><p>The electricity that awakens in your body in the first stage will
help you in dancing, shouting, crying and laughing. You also have to
cooperate from your side and whatever comes from within has to be
totally allowed to happen. If your hands are shaking even a little bit,
you make them shake totally so that whatever impulses are suppressed in
them get released, catharted. Through this experiment so much can happen
in these four days which cannot happen even in four years through any
other common experiment.</p><p><br></p><p>After the second stage your body will feel weightless, as if it has
become absolutely light, as if it can fly. Twofold things will be felt.
After the first stage, the body will be felt to be full of energy. After
the second stage, energy will be full there but the body would have
become weightless and light. After the second stage, you will clearly
feel it that there is no body but only an energy.</p><p><br></p><p>In this second stage, an amazing phenomenon will be experienced by
those who have really been total with the experiment and that is, for
the first time they will start feeling that body is separate and I am
separate. If you let go of your body totally, your identity [with the
body] will be broken. This can happen today. The only condition is that
you cooperate with it totally, that you prevent nothing on your part.
You are not to think that when you will dance or shout what will someone
else say. Whatever is happening from inside you, you let it happen, you
do not worry about it. And then in this ten minutes, what you have
always heard and read that body and you are separate will become part of
your experience. You will see the dancing body separate from you, you
will become a witness that the body is weeping. You will be able to see
very clearly that someone else is laughing and I am witnessing. This
realization is a necessary door for taking one deep into meditation.
Without this, no one can be in meditation.</p><p>In the third stage when this experience would have happened in the
second stage that the body is separate and I am separate, there will
arise a natural question then as to who am I? Up til now I thought that
I was the body, I was the breathing, now body and breathing are
appearing separate from me – then who am I? In this third stage we will
ask within ourselves - who am I?</p><p><br></p><p>In the first ten minutes fast and wild breathing, in the second ten
minutes absolute cooperation with the body, and in the third ten
minutes, the intense query: ‘Who am I?’ You have to ask within
yourselves so vigorously that from toe to head, only one question starts
echoing:‘Who am I?’ And the waves of electricity that must have been
awakened by now, will catch your question and will start echoing in the
vibrations of the whole body -’ who am I?’ You have to ask so quickly
that there is no space between two ’who am I?’s. You have to ask it with
such force that there is no time, energy or convenience left for
thinking anything else. So, for ten minutes only one question remains.
After five minutes of intense questioning inside, to many friends it
would have taken over loudly on the outside. There is nothing to be
worried about it.</p><p>In the beginning, ‘who am I?’ is to be asked within. If it starts
coming outside, as a shouting, let it come out. Nothing to worry about.
In thirty minutes your body will be tired, your vitality will be tired,
your mind-energy will be tired. These three stages will make the three
forces tired. And in the thirty minutes you have to reach to such a
climax of tension, you have to do all this in thirty minutes so
vigorously that now even if you want to shout, you would not be able to,
you would remain silent. If you go on asking ‘who am I?’ slowly like a
dead man then that momentum would not be created which is essential. The
water has to be boiled to 100 degrees to evaporate into vapor. It does
not evaporate at 98 degrees, nor at 99 degrees. You cannot say to God
that just for one degree why this stubbornness. It has come to 99
degrees, please make it vapor, it is a matter of only one degree. It has
come upto 99 degrees, why are you being so miserly just for one degree?
But such things make no difference. The water will evaporate into vapor
only at 100 degrees. If you stop even at 99 degrees, evaporating into
vapor is a far away thing, the water will gradually become cold
again.</p><p>Exactly like this, in each individual there is a point of climax from
where the upward movement of life energies begins, from where the
revolution begins, from where the mutation begins. If you do not reach
to that 100 degrees point, where man dissolves and God begins, you will
fall back to zero and the whole effort will be wasted. It will have no
meaning. Hence I will ask you that whatever I am saying, do it honestly
and see. See what it can do. Experiment for four days and see it for
yourself. Those who will experiment honestly, will attain to trust.
Trust is not required beforehand. You need not believe that what I am
saying will surely happen. You accept only this much that this man is
saying something, let us experiment and see. If something happens, fine,
if nothing happens, know that it was wrong. But if you did, the
happening is as certain as the water evaporating at 100 degrees. Nobody
needs to believe in it; water does not boil by any belief; you may be a
non-believer, an atheist, it makes no difference; you boil the water and
it will turn into vapor at 100 degrees.</p><p>The meditation I am talking about, is totally a scientific
phenomenon. You may be an atheist, you may be a non-believer, you may be
denying soul, you may be denying religion – no problem, there is no need
to believe anything. You experiment and you will find inner changes
happening through that experiment.</p><p><br></p><p>Trust is the outcome of meditation, not a pre-requirement to it.</p><p><br></p><p>Let me say a few things more before you stand up for the experiment.
Those who may be sick or</p><p>weak, they are to do the experiment sitting, all the rest will do the
experiment standing. Standing, the results are quicker, sitting, the
results are not that quick. All will stand up leaving enough space
around. There is plenty of space here. So that if you are dancing, you
do not collide with anybody. But if one may collide, do not be bothered
by it.</p><p><br></p><p>There are two more things. Before the experiment begins, I will ask
you to close your eyes and they are to remain closed for forty minutes.
This will be your first firm resolve. This has to be fulfilled honestly.
Even if you open the eyes once, you lose. The energy that would have
accumulated within you, will be wasted. The Major part of our inner
energy dissipates through our eyes. Hence eyes have to be kept
completely closed for forty minutes. Until not give the suggestion, you
are not to open your eyes. There will be shouting, crying, dancing
around you and within you, you need not bother. There may arise a desire
to look, because the child within us does not die so soon. This inside
child does not die as fast as one’s body changes; he may desire to know
what the next man is doing. For that purpose, I have called for a film
crew. It will be ready today only, so we will show it at night and you
can see completely who is doing what. So your curiosity will be
satisfied. Hence you will not worry right now as to who is doing what.
That you will be able to see in the film.</p><p><br></p><p>Onlookers are not allowed to be here. If someone is here only to see,
he should go outside the campus, or he may go far in the back, but no
one will be here as a onlooker. Anyone who is not participating in the
meditation experiment, has to leave. His presence will be a disturbance
to all our friends. He has to leave. When you are meditating, the whole
atmosphere is charged, and even one non-participant standing in the
middle harms and breaks the chain of energy. Such a person is not needed
here. Hence those who do not want to participate, will not stand here,
they will leave quietly. Remove all the chairs from here, because
someone may stumble on them and fall over. You get off the chairs and
put them away.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=_index>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

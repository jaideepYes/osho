It is for research only.]\nMy Beloved Ones,\nThe eighth sutra of Yoga. In the seventh sutra I told you, that conscious life has two forms - self- conscious and self unconscious. The eighth sutra is: Yoga begins from self consciousness and ends in dissolution of self. To be self conscious is the way, to become free from self is the goal. To be full of consciousness for the self is meditation and finally only consciousness remains and the self disappears, that is enlightenment.\nThose who do not know themselves, they are certainly backward, those who get stuck at themselves, they also lag behind. Just as if someone, after climbing the ladder, remains on the ladder then the climb becomes useless. One has to climb on the ladder and one also has to leave the ladder. If he stops on the way, then also he does not reach to the goal. One has to walk on the path and one also has to leave the path. Then one reaches the goal. The path can lead you upto the goal only if you are prepared to leave the path. And the path will become a barrier in reaching the goal if one insists on staying on it.\nTo be full of consciousness for the self is helpful in order to dissolve the self. But if self itself is held on to, then that which is helpful, the same becomes an obstacle. Perhaps it is most important to understand this sutra. It is our earnest desire to attain to ourselves but to dissolve oneself is a difficult thing. That is why many seekers reach the seventh sutra but are unable to enter into the\neighth. Upto the seventh sutra there is no barrier to our ego. The journey upto the seventh sutra is ego-centered. Hence upto the seventh sutra if the seeker is asked to renounce wealth, he will renounce wealth. If he is asked to give up his family, he will renounce his family. If he is asked to give up fame, ambition, the throne, he will give up all that. But behind all this renounciation, the ego goes on becoming stronger.\nHe will be interested in meditation so that ‘I’ becomes more enhanced. He will be engaged in meditation so that I become something. He will search for the divine so that he does not remain without it. There is no difficulty, no obstacle to come upto the seventh sutra. The real problem is understanding the eighth sutra after the seventh sutra because the eighth sutra is of losing oneself, of dissolving oneself. Upto the seventh sutra one can attain great powers. Upto the seventh sutra boundless energy will be born but there will be no becoming one with the divine. Upto the seventh sutra one will meet oneself only.\nEven meeting with oneself is not a small thing, it is very big. But it is big in the context of the last six sutras, in the context of the eighth sutra, it is not a big thing. Attaining to oneself is difficult. To know oneself totally is also very difficult, but it is much more difficult to lose and dissolve even oneself. If a person is imprisoned in a prison then the first condition for him to become free of the prison will be that he realises that he is in a prison. If he does not realise that he is in a prison then there is no way for him to get out of the prison. The first condition for him to get out of the prison will be to know that I am in a prison. The second condition would be to know the prison well, that what it really is? Where there is a wall? Where there is a way? Where there are windows? Where there is glass? Where there is the weak point from where it is possible to escape, where are the guards? The second sutra will be to become completely familiar with the prison, to be totally aware of the prison, only then it is possible to get rid of the prison.\nDeep down inside man self is the prison, in the self ego is the only prison. It seems to be a small prison but it is big. It is full of great energies, full of great treasures, but still it is a prison. Out of it, is the vast expansion of existencewhere there is freedom, where there is liberation. First of all we are not aware of our own self, that which is so big. To get to know it gets completed upto the seventh sutra. And when you come to know it completely then there is danger, great danger, I will tell you about that danger. One who manages to get across that danger will be able to understand the seventh sutra. The moment you become aware that I am the master of so many treasures, so many jewels, so much wealth, the prison starts looking like an emperor’s palace and not a prison anymore. Even if a prisoner comes to know that there are so many treasures in the prison, so much gold, so much wealth, if he comes to know about the treasures of the prison then probably he would also say no to the fact that this is a prison and say that this is an emperor’s palace. And perhaps this treasure only, will now become a barrier in his getting out of the prison. It is possible that the guards may not have been able to stop him, chains may not have stopped him, all the arrangements of the prison may not have stopped him from escaping but the treasures found by him in the prison can stop him.\nThe day we come to know about the whole treasure of our being, the entire power of our bliss, the danger is that we may forget that this self is a very small piece of land, it is a very small part of the vast infinite land. It is as if somebody has filled water in an earthen pot and dropped it into the ocean. The water which is inside the earthen pot is also of the ocean. But how can there be any comparison between the water of the ocean inside the earthen pot and the ocean outside the earthen pot!\nWe are also earthen pots. There is plenty inside. It is a part of the divine, a part of the ocean but how can it be compared with what is outside? The earthen pot has also to be broken one day. This self, this ‘I’, this ego is surrounding you. But the day you come to know the entire beauty of the self, that day the earthen pot becomes a pot made of gold. It becomes very difficult to break it. That is why many times strange kinds of egos are born in a seeker. Many times the last thing which stops the seeker on his path of meditation is that place where his ‘I’ becomes of gold, where he feels that I am the master of infinite energy, infinite knowledge, infinite power. This declaration becomes very deep declaration of his inner ‘I’. Those who stop at this, stop at the seventh sutra. And this stopping is just as if a person after coming closer to his destination stops at the gate. He completes the whole journey but stops outside the destination. And this does happen. A person walks thousands of miles but as he comes clser to his destination, it becomes difficult to take even a single step. He is able to walk for miles, he is able to run till the destination is far away but as it starts coming closer, exhaustion starts taking over. It has happened quite often that just after coming outside their destinations, people have gone on to rest.\nMany seekers get stuck at the seventh sutra. The eighth sutra is a jump. A big jump. The fact of attaining is not such a big thing, the fact of losing yourself is much bigger. Then the question arises in the mind why to lose oneself? If we are not there ourselves then whatever there will be what is its meaning, its purpose? If the self will not be there then what will be enlightenment, what will be the divine, what will be Yoga, what will be religion? Freedom can be dropped for the self. Freedom from the self is a very difficult thing. Freedom for the self is very easy, your mind feels that I should become free, liberated. But in freedom from the self, you get stuck. Mind is ready for that last jump. But Yoga has a way with which that last jump can be completed.\nThe most important search that starts for entering the eighth sutra after the seventh sutra is of ‘Who am I?’ The search for this starts. ‘What am I?’, you come to know till the seventh sutra. But ‘Who am I?’, you do not know till the seventh sutra. The search for ‘Who am I?’, becomes the eighth sutra. And the deeper we search, the more we find that my end is not here also, I am not only till here but beyond this also, beyond and beyond. The search goes on and on and all the boundaries get dissolved, and in the end you come to know that whatever there is, I am all that. The day you come to know that whatever there is I am all that, that day ‘I’ does not remain because only ‘You’ remains. No ‘You’ remains in the outside world. Everything is ‘I’.\nAt the time of revolution in 1857, British soldiers had killed a sannyasin. He had been silent for thirty years. People had asked him, “Why are you becoming silent?” He had said, “What I want to say, I cannot say because words are incapable and what I can say, I don’t want to say because it is futile.” And then for thirty years he was silent. He used to wander around, naked, silent. Once in the night he was walking on the road and nearby there was a British camp. They caught him thinking him to be a detective. They asked him many times, “Who are you?”. But whenever they asked him, “Who are you?, he laughed. He was in silence so he could not answer also. And who has been able to answer the question of”Who am I?” till now? And the answer has been impossible to give. When you find the answer, the answer is no more there.\nSo this puzzle has not been solved yet and will never be solved. When the seeker gets dissolved only then the answer is achieved. But then the answer no longer means anything. And till the seeker exists, the answer cannot be found. So the answer cannot be given because it has not been found.\nHe used to laugh heartily. The more he laughed, the more angry the soldiers got and in the end they\nplunged the bayonet in his chest. They thought that he was deceiving them. At the time of his death he did say two words- he broke his thirty years silence at the time of his death. And the breaking of his silence of thirty years was really strange. And the answer that he had given was even more strange, because the soldiers were asking him, “Who are you?” He did not give any answer to this. At the time of his death he opened his eyes and laughed again and he had used a great line from the Upanishad. He had said to the British soldiers who had plunged the bayonet in him, “That art thou, white man, you are also that! They had asked,”Who are you?” He had replied at the time of his death, “You are also that.”He had not said, “Whoever I am, you are also that.” The rest he dropped, that is understood. He dropped saying I am also that because who will say, “I am that”, there is no ‘I’ left. He had replied in a round-about-way. He said, “You are also that, That art thou.”\nWho knows, maybe the soldiers did not get the hint, it is difficult that they could have understood. “Who am I?” In the end, this search becomes in the disappearance of ‘I’. The search for it can only be done after the seventh sutra, before that it is very difficult. It is easy after the seventh sutra. Now we can ask because now we are awake, now we are filled with light, we can ask, “Who am I?” And this question is the only religious question. You can never find its answer. It is not that you get the answer that you are god. Till you get this answer, understand that it is your mind answering. The scriptures you have read, they are answering. The words you have heard, they are answering. The doctrines that you have learnt, they are answering.\nThat eighth sutra does not get solved by scriptures, will not get solved by doctrines. So if your mind gives the answer to this eighth sutra that you are Brahma or what I said just now’That art thou’, you must have also read it, then that is not the solution. You ask yourself, “Who am I?” and the mind says, “You are that”, that is also not the solution. Till you can give the answer, you will not find the answer because you don’t have the answer, you only have words. “Who am I?”, this question should go so deep in you that the answer does not arise in you, only the question remains - only a silent question remains. Each breath starts asking, “Who am I?”,every core starts asking, “Who am I?”, every heartbeat starts asking, “Who am I?” - sitting, standing, walking, questioning or not questioning; only one question starts echoing in your mind, “Who am I?” And you don’t find any answer. There is no answer because if you have the answer with you then there is no need to ask.\nBut all of us have answers, that is why in the eighth sutra all scriptures become barriers. All knowledge becomes a barrier. That which we call knowledge, all that we have learnt, understood, memorized, all becomes a barrier. Even the greatest words become barriers-Geeta, Kuran, Bible all become barriers. Whatever we have read, whatever we have learnt, all starts becoming a barrier in the eighth sutra because it is our memory which answers that I am this, I am this, I am this. All these answers have to be destroyed. These answers are not ours. Those who have given them, must have known before giving them, must have understood before giving them but these answers are not ours. This answer is not mine. This knowing is not mine, it is borrowed, it is stale.\nBefore this eighth sutra, a person will have to drop all knowledge and become totally ignorant. And one who is capable of becoming ignorant - this ignorant is of a completely different kind. Socrates has made a small, very beautiful distinction. And the people who have reached near the eighth sutra, Socrates is one of them. Some people of the village went to Socrates and said, “The Goddess of Delphi has declared that no one is wiser than Socrates.” They said, “These are the words of the Goddess of Delphi that no one is wiser than Socrates! - what do you say?”Socrates said, “Somewhere or the other, there has been some mistake because I say to you that no one is more\nignorant than Socrates.” The people said, “This is a difficult situation. Now if we believe the Goddess of Delphi then we will have to believe Socrates also. And Socrates says that no one is more ignorant than Socrates. And if we believe Socrates that no one is more ignorant than Socrates then what about Delphi’s words. Socrates has put us into difficulty.”\nSocrates said, “It is my job to put you into difficulty. I also faced many difficulties before it became possible for me to reach here.” But they asked, “What should we believe?” Socrates said, “Go back and ask the Goddess of Delphi.” They went back and asked the Goddess of Delphi, “Socrates says no one is more ignorant than me and you say that no one is wiser than him.” The Goddess of Delphi said, “That is why, that is why I say that nobody is wiser than him because one who has come to know about one’s own ignorance, he is standing at the door of knowledge.” They came back and said to Socrates, “The Goddess says that is why. Now the puzzle has become more complicated. She says that Socrates can call himself ignorant because he is standing at the door of his destination.” Socrates said, “Did you notice that when you came and told me I thought from where did the Goddess of Delphi get this wrong notion?”\nBut her words were very meaningful. In these words she had not said that Socrates is the wisest. She had said that no one was wiser than Socrates. She had said the negative. She had not said that he was the wisest.\nSo Socrates said, “You went back to the Goddess, I went to enquire in the village if there was anybody wiser than me or not? So I went and asked each and every person. They had answers to all the questions except they did not have the answer to the question, ‘Who are you?’ ‘Who am I?’, they did not have any answer to this question. So I said to them that what kind of wise people are you? who still don’t know who we are? what is the meaning of their knowing anything else? Those who have not yet been able to know who I am, what else will they be able to know? I went to each and every wise person and came back.” And then he said, “The Goddess is very clever. She said that nobody is wiser than Socrates.” The only meaning of this is that everybody is ignorant in the village but only Socrates is aware that he is ignorant. There is no other meaning. Nobody in the village has even this much knowledge.\nOnly the person who experiences his ignorance will be able to get across the seventh sutra. One who becomes aware that I don’t know anything. Not even who I am. And when you come to know it deeply, intensely, then its pain is utterly exquisite. The pain of ‘who am I’ spreads into each and every core. Then it does not remain a question, then it does not remain an intellectual enquiry. Then it does not remain an existential question which has an answer somewhere. Then it becomes the craving of your being, the thirst of your being, then it becomes a continuous anticipation of your being. The being starts trembling with only one burning desire, to know:“Who am I?” And you don’t find any answer anywhere, there is no answer anywhere. One who will get the answer from somewhere is deceiving himself. There is no answer anywhere.\nWhen you do not find any answer anywhere and the question goes on hurting, drives you mad, destroys you inside; when the question remains only a question, even the hope of getting an answer fades away, the possibility of an answer fades away, the expectation of an answer also fades away; that you will find an answer when that possibility also fades away, only the question remains, rather it should be said that when the questioner and the queation become one, at that moment the question also disappears. You do not find an answer, the question is also dropped. Unquestioning, in that\nmoment the person enters into the eighth sutra from the seventh sutra. At that moment he does not ask, “Who am I?”, at that moment he says, “Tell me that which I am not.” At that moment he asks, “Where I am not?”\nNanak went and slept outside the temple of Mecca. His feet were towards the holy stone of Mecca. The priests came and said, “Remove your feet. Idiot, you don’t even know that you should not point your feet towards the holy stone. He points his feet towards the divine.” Nanak said, “I am in a diliema. You point my feet in the direction where there is no divine. Grab my feet and point them where there is no divine.” Those priests got into great difficulty. They did not dare to point Nanak’s feet anywhere else because the divine is everywhere.\nThe day the very question “Who am I?” is dropped, that day there remains no concern anymore about “Who am I?” That day even if somebody questioned it, our only answer will be: “Who am I not? I am everything.” That day the barrier of the wall of ‘self’ standing in between disappears. It crumbles. It is absolutely a wall of dreams. It is a wall of thoughts, a wall of memories, a wall of beliefs, you have believed that you are like this and this and that is why the wall is there. This wall crumbles. The moment it crumbles, the person becomes one with the infinite. Then the self- centered personality disappears.\nIt is not that you get destroyed. It is not that you are finished. No, you are still there, and with more totality. But you do not remain ‘I’, you become everything. Then you do not remain a wave, then you become the ocean. Then you do not remain a drop, you become the vastness. You die as ‘I’ but become like the divine. That is why nothing is lost by losing the ‘I’. Just as nobody loses anything by waking up from a night’s dream, in the same way nobody loses anything by waking up from the dream of ‘I’. He gains something by waking up from a night’s dream, some awakening. He also gains something by waking up from the dream of ‘I’, a divine life. The insignificant barrier breaks down. That meaningless cycle breaks. That dividing line of ‘I’ gets dissolved. There is no need for it now. It was needed till the seventh step, till the seventh sutra, it was needed. The journey till now has been completed with the help of this ‘I’. If that ‘I’ is not there then that much journey cannot be completed. Lies also help in the journey, illusions also help in the journey. They cannot take you to the destination, they cannot go with you to the destination.\nOne Christian priest was imprisoned in a Russian jail for twenty years. He has written a very unique book “In God’s Underground”. He was a beautiful man that he called his prison which was a dark cell under the ground, “In God’s Underground” and wrote a small book. That was also God’s hidden house under the ground. He was imprisoned in a dark cell for twenty years. Food used to be thrown in once a day, but he did not hear anyone’s voice. But after five-seven days suddenly somebody started knocking at the wall from next door. He tried to understand but what could he understand from the knocking. But he understood this much that there was another prisoner next door. Then for twenty years, they lived together with a wall in the middle. Then they slowly invented a language by knocking. one knock for A, two knocks for B, three for C-this kind of language they slowly developed. Then they got to know each other’s name and started giving messages to each other. Then they also started greeting each other after getting up in the morning. Then they started wishing good-night to each other at night. Then their communication gathered speed, a code was developed. If these two persons come out of the prison then will they still talk by knocking on the wall? No, they will not. They had to develop a sign language without which it was not possible to talk through the wall.\nA person’s ‘I’ is also a code language which has to be used all around the world where we are\nenclosed in our own walls, where we have to knock and talk to each other. So we name the other, we call somebody Ram, somebody Krishna, somebody something else and so on. All names are false. No child is born with a name, but without a name it would be very difficult to talk through walls. So Krishna means two knocks. Ram means three knocks. So we get acquainted with each other by knocking that if we knock three times then know that we are calling you. You are now Ram and you Krishna. We stick names on people, this is a code language, where there is no other way to talk through walls. We give everybody a name. If I want to call somebody then I say, “Ram, come here.” I can also have a name. I have a name but if I call out my name then it would be very difficult to make out whether I am calling someone else or myself. That is why the code-language is two-sided. When I want to call myself then I say ‘I’ and when I want to call somebody else then I call out his name. When you also want to call yourself you also say ‘I’ and when you want to call someone else you call out their name.\nSwami Ram went to America, he used to call himself Ram. He had stopped saying “I”. Naturally if you break the code language, there will be difficulty. He used to call himself Ram. If somebody used to laugh on the way or somebody swore at him, he used to come back and say, “Today, Ram was in a great difficulty. Some people came-by and started swearing.” So people who were unacquainted, in America used to ask, “What do you mean? What are you saying? Ram who?” Then he used to say, “This Ram.” They were in great difficulty. Slowly they understood the code that this man calls himself Ram.\nBut whether we call ourselves ‘Ram’ or say ‘I’, give ourselves a name or use a pronoun, use ‘I’ – we are born neither with ‘I’ nor with a name. Children come to know about ‘you’ first. Later on they come to know about ‘I’. Children become ‘thou’conscious first, first they come to know about others, ’I’, they come to know later. When ‘you’ becomes very certain, that is why sometimes some children are heard saying, “He is hungry.” Small children will say, “Who is hungry?”, ‘I’ has not developed yet. ‘I’ has to develop.\nIn the communication of this life where each of us is enclosed in a circle of his own, in walls of his own, a code language has to be developed. ‘I’ is an indicator, is a hint towards whom even I don’t know that who he is. Krishna, Ram are indicators towards whom even I don’t know who he is. We are all standing on the other side of the wall. We are all like prisoners who go on knocking at our own walls. But life is like that, we do not understand this because we move carrying our cells, our walls with ourselves. ‘Those prisoners are imprisoned, the walls are fixed at one place.’\nRight from birth we carry our prisons with ourselves, that is why we never come to know that I am carrying my walls with me. A husband and wife, their whole life, go on talking in code language through two walls, which is understood only once in a while, and when it is not understood, then it is not understood. A father and son also talk, friends also talk but through walls. They knock saying something else, the other understands something else. He knocks in fear and they understand something else on the other side. But they forget one thing that both ‘I’ and ‘you’ are utilitarian words, not the truth. They have utility, but they are not the truth.\nThat is why the moment we start searching for ‘I’, we will find that ‘I’ is nowhere to be found. It is nowhere to be found. Just as the man whose name is Krishna, if he goes inside himself in search of Krishna, then would he find Krishna anywhere? That label is stuck outside the container. If you go searching for it inside, you will not find it anywhere. ‘I’ is also nowhere inside. They are utilitarian\nwords, inventions of language but are not important. And till the seventh sutra, the seeker is not hindered by them, in fact they help him, because he comes till the seventh sutra in the search of ‘I’ only. Power for ‘I’, peace for ‘I’, freedom for ‘I’, the divine for ‘I’, he comes in search of these till the seventh sutra. Till the seventh ‘I’ is utilitarian not the truth. After the seventh ‘I’ starts becoming a barrier, its utility has gone waste now. At the eighth that code language has to be broken. There is pain when you break it at the eighth, because we did everything for this ‘I’, we lived for this ‘I’, we died for this ‘I’, just for this ‘I’ who knows how many times we took birth.\nA fakir went to China from India. His name was Bodhidharma. The Emperor of China had come to welcome him. On the way to entering the kingdom, the Emperor who had come to welcome him, saw his chance and said to him, “I am very disturbed, please tell me some way.” Bodhidharma said, “Come tomorrow morning at three o’clock and I will make you peaceful.” That Emperor had asked that question to many fakirs and they had given him different ways, but this man seemed to be strange. He said, “Come tomorrow morning at three o’clock and I will make you peaceful. He had his doubts also that this matter cannot be so easy. He had been disturbed his whole life, had tried many ways, but he did not attain peace. He said again to Bodhidharma,”Perhaps you do not know about my difficulty. Whatever wealth I need, I have attained it, but I cannot find peace. Whatever fasting fakirs told me to do, I did, but I cannot find peace. I have built lakhs of temples, but I cannot find peace. Whatever good deeds I was told to do, I did their double, but I cannot find peace.”\nThat fakir said, “No more talk, come tomorrow morning at three o’clock and I will make you peaceful.” He felt amazed. He thought, alright, we will see at three o’clock. Now he felt doubtful that whether it is even right to go to this man or not. He was coming down the stairs of the temple where Bodhidharma was staying, he had just reached the last step when Bodhidharma shouted and said, “Listen, bring”I” with you, otherwise who shall I make peaceful.” He thought, “More madness!” He thought that when I will come then “I” will naturally be with me. Bodhidharma said, “Remember to bring it, don’t leave it at home.” In the night the Emperor thought about it many times that whether he should go or not but thought he had never encountered a man who said that he would make him peaceful.\nIn the morning, gathering all his courage, he came at three o’clock. He started climbing the stairs. He had not even climbed the first stair when Bodhidharma said, “Did you bring”I” with you or not?” Emperor Wu said, “Why are you joking with me, when I have come then what is the question of bringing”I” with me?” Bodhidharma said, “I ask deliberately – I am here and I can see it but still my”I” is not with me now. That is why I asked whether you had brought it with you or not, otherwise who will I make peaceful?” Emperor Wu could not understand what Bodhidharma was saying. Then again Bodhidharma said, “Alright, now that you have come. And you say that you have brought it with you, then sit. Close your eyes and look for your”I”, where it is and then get hold of it and give it to me so that I can make it peaceful.\nHe said to Bodhidharma, “I was doubtful last night only that I should not go. What are you talking about? Is”I” something that I can catch hold of and give to you?” Then Bodhidharma said, “Alright, if you cannot give it to me then at least you yourself can catch hold of it inside you?” The Emperor said, “I have never tried it.” Bodhidharma said, “Then try it.” The emperor is sitting there with his eyes closed and Bodhidharma is sitting in front of him with a big stick in his hand.\nThe emperor was feeling scared also. It is night, it is dark and he had come alone trusting that monk. Who knows, what he intends to do? Bodhidharma would sometimes move his head with the stick\nand say, “Search, don’t miss any corner. Wherever you find it, grab it.” Half an hour has passed, quarter of an hour has passed, an hour has passed, two hours have passed and that emperor has got lost somewhere! The morning sun started rising. Bodhidharma said, “Now should I take my bath and do other things? You have not been able to catch it till now?” The emperor opened his eyes and fell at Bodhidharma’s feet. He said, “I had never noticed that there is no such thing as”I” inside. When I went to look, it was nowhere to be found. I looked into every nook and corner. Everywhere I looked, but “I” is nowhere to be found.\nThen Bodhidharma, “Now whom should I make peaceful? I am sitting here with this stick in my hand for three hours.” The emperor said, “Now it has become silent, because when”I” is not there, then what kind of disturbance can there be? These three hours were the hours of my silence only. As I started looking and as I started becoming aware that I am not achieving, something went on becoming silent. Now I can say that it was wrong to say that I was disturbed. ‘I’ itself was the disturbance. Bodhidharma said, “Go and beware of”I” in the future, don’t cling on to it again.\nEmperor Wu has got it written on his grave that I heard words of lakhs of sannyasins and saints, I heard thousands of scriptures, but I could not catch hold of the secret. And then after coming in contact with a strange fakir, I looked inside and all the secrets came out into the open. There was no ‘I’ which had to be made silent. There was no ‘I’ which had to be purified. There was no ‘I’ which had to fought with and conquered. There was no ‘I’ for which God and enlightenment had to be found. There was no ‘I’ there.\nThe eighth sutra is the sutra of looking for “I” and then losing the “I”. The moment “I” is lost, everything is attained. “I” means that we are holding on to something against everybody. If we say “I” rightly, then “I” means a point of resistance.\nWe are holding on to this ‘I’ against everybody, in enmity with everybody. We have dropped everybody and caught hold of this “I”. This “I” is just like the boundaries of countries – India, Pakistan. If we go looking, then there is no boundary where India ends and Pakistan begins. There is no boundary anywhere, there is no boundary where India ends and China begins except in the minds of the politicians. These boundaries are nowhere. And it would have been alright if the politicians had any brains. There are no boundaries except on the political maps. Go up, if you look from above from the sky, then there is no India, no Pakistan, no China, no Japan. There are no boundaries. If there is somebody on Mars and looking towards the earth then will he be able to see any boundaries?\nWhen Yuri Gagarin went into the space for the first time, his countrymen were expecting that he would send some message from there, from the space, that he would shout ‘Long live Soviet Russia’, that he sould say something like that. But the first words that came out of Yuri Gagarin’s mouth are worth understanding. “My Russia” did not come out of Yuri Gagarin’s mouth, the words which came out of his mouth were “My World”, “My Earth”. Looking from such a great height, no country remained. Looking from such a great height, the whole earth had become one, the whole world had become one. The words that he said were, “My World! My Earth!” When he returned, Moscow asked him, “Why did’nt you say, ‘My Russia?’” He said, “No Russia remained from there. All the boundaries were lost there!”\nIn the same way when one goes into the inner sky, the boundaries of “I” and “You” are lost there. They are also man’s utilitarian boundaries drawn on a map. Just as my house makes a false\nboundary, my “I” also makes that false boundary. Just as my country makes a false boundary, my “I” also makes a false boundary. But these lies will work only till the seventh sutra, not after the seventh sutra. If you want to walk on the earth, if you want to walk horizontally, then Russia, India and Pakistan will walk, but if you want to make a vertical flight, then Russia, India will be lost. One who wants to rise high in the inner sky, his “I” and “You” all will be lost, and when “I” and “You” are lost then that which remains, the remaining is the divine. This is the eighth sutra.\nAnd the ninth sutra is a small one, I will finish my talk after telling you about it.\nThe first sutra, I had said, was life energy. The ninth sutra is of yoga. Death is also energy. Death too is energy. It is not that only life is energy, death too is energy. It is not that only life is life, death too is life. And it is not that only life is worth liking, death too is very beautiful. It is not that only life is worth welcoming, death also needs an open door. And one who does not accept death will remain deprived of life. And one who accepts death will be entitled to the ultimate life.\nDeath too is energy, death too is divine, death too is god. It is the ultimate sutra of yoga. It is the last sutra. One who will be able to see death in the same way as life; it is like that, it is just a question of seeing it. And after the eighth sutra, it will be possible to see. The day you come to know that there is no “I”, that day you will come to know, whose death? What kind of death? Who will die? Who can die? Till the people say that I will not die, I am immortal, my soul is immortal, till then understand that all that talk is just what they have heard. When someone says that there is no “I” and what is there is divine, then understand that this is something. I want to be immortal but I am not there. One who wants to become immortal is not there and one who is immortal, we do not know about it.\nAt the time of Ramakrishna’s death, it had become clear three days before that Ramakrishna is taking leave now. So his wife Sharda became very worried and upset. Ramakrishna asked her, “Why do you cry? Because the one who is, is not going to die. And did you love this body known as me or did you love the one who is?” Sharda said, “I loved the one who is.” Ramakrishna said, “Then drop the worry. Then, when he who is not dies, do not break your bangles.” There was only one widow in India who did not break her bangles after her husband’s death Then Ramakrishna died. Everybody else cried and wept but Sharda did not agree to break her bangles. She remained the same as she always was. Everybody said, “What are you doing? Ramakrishna is dead.” She said, “One who has died was not there in the first place, and the one who was there, still is. These bangles are in this memory. Sharda remained a bride even after Ramakrishna’s death. She never said that Ramakrishna is dead and whenever somebody asked she would say,”That body had become worn and torn, he has only changed clothes.” In reality, only clothes are changed, only garbs are changed.\nThe day you come to know this – you will know at the eighth sutra that I am not there, then who will die? Then where is death? Then there is no way to die. Then if someone cuts with a sword then who will be cut? He can only cut “I”, who else? When there is no “I”, then there is nobody to be cut. What Krishna said to Arjuna that neither anybody dies nor anybody kills – its meaning is only this much that there is nobody. The shadows which are seen become small and large with the rising and setting of the sun. They are not there, they become small and large with the sun’s shadow.\nGibran has written a story that a fox has come out in search of food. The sun is awake and is behind the fox. The fox’s shadow falls very big like big tall trees. The fox thought today I will need a lot of food. I have such a big body. The fox does not have any mirror to see her body, she has only her\nshadow. And even in the mirror only the shadow will be visible, what else? And one who is standing on the other side of the mirror, it is said by those who know, that he is also a shadow. She had seen her shadow, long shadow like the trees. She thought in her mind, “This is a great difficulty. Today I will have to search for bigger food. I will need at least a camel. She went on searching, then it was afternoon and the sun came overhead. The shadow shrank and became small. The fox looked down and said,”I am very hungry. Now even if I find something small, it will do. The shadow has shrunk. It has become small. But that fox believes the shadow to be its being.\nWhat we call body, in a very deep dimension is not more than a shadow. A shadow materialized. A shadow, which has become visible because of the density of energy particles. The coming and going of that shadow. But till “I” is there, till then there is identity with that shadow.\nThe ninth sutra is, death too is life, death too is energy, death too is the divine. And one who knows death too as the divine attains to enlightenment. Enlightenment means, there is no death for such a person. Enlightenment means such death where there is no death.\nI said to you these nine sutras of yoga. These nine sutras can be said in twelve dimensions, can be said in twelve different ways. I said in only one way. These nine sutras can be said in twelve different ways. And when you multiply twelve with nine it becomes one hundred and eight. The malas with one hundred and eight beads that you have seen in the necks of sannyasins are nothing more than a symbol of these nine sutras which can be said in twelve ways. And below those 108 beads you must have also seen the one hundred ninth part which is known as sumeru. Anybody starting from anywhere on these one hundred and eight ways will reach to that same ultimate one. I said these nine sutras of yoga to you only in one dimension. They can be said in twelve ways, thus making for 108 methods of meditation. One method of meditation is developed from each sutra. But from wherever one starts, he definitely reaches the same place. Even if somebody does not start from anywhere, then too, wherever he is standing, he is standing at the same place. The only difference is that he does not come to know where he is standing.\nI have heard about one fakir that he used to just lie in the way of a pilgrimage. The pilgrims used to climb and go on the top of the mountain. They used to say to the fakir, “You go on lying there, go on lying there, shouldn’t you climb up for the pilgrimage? So the fakir used to say,”Where you are going, I am already there.” Then again while returning when somebody asked him, “Will you go on lying here or climb up and travel?” The fakir used to say, “From where you are coming, I am there.” Those pilgrims would not understand and used to go away from there.\nThe day you come to know, after the journey, you find it very funny. Zen masters say that when you come to know you find it very funny. Zen masters have a saying that ‘when you come to know then except for laughing while sipping a cup of tea, nothing remains.’ When someone was asking Rinzai, “What is this? What kind of talk is this that we have heard that when you attain enlightenment then except for laughing and sipping tea, nothing remains?” Rinzai said, “Really, nothing remains, because when you come to know, then you also become aware that I was like this always. What I have found, I already had it and what I searched for, I had never lost it. But still you have to make such a long journey.\nA small story and then I will complete my talk.\nI have heard, just before his death, a billionaire became aware that he had never experienced bliss. He must have been fortunate. Some people become aware only after death. He became aware before death that he had not experienced bliss. Death was close-by. Astrologers said, “There are not many days left, be quick.” He said, “I have been hurrying all my life but where is bliss? And now I have the means to buy it. I am ready to buy it at any cost.” Those astrologers said, “That we do not know. We can only say that hurry because death is close-by. And if you come to know, then let us know also because we will also have to hurry, death is close-by. But he said,”But where should I look for it?” They said, “We don’t know. You just go look for it, anywhere, just look for it.\nHe climbed his fastest horse. He put diamonds, jewels worth crores of rupees on his horse and then going to each and every village started shouting, “If somebody gives me a glimpse of bliss then I am ready to give him all this.”\nThen he reached a village, where there was a Sufi fakir. The people of the village said, “You have come to the right place. There is a man in this village who solves this kind of absurd problems.” He said, “Absurd problems!” The people of that village said, “We have also learnt a few absurd things by being in his company. One thing we have learnt, it is quite absurd absurd because nobody can buy even a glimpse of bliss with money, bliss is very far away. But still you have come, you did right. You have come to the right place. There is such a man in this village.\nThat man was searched for. The villagers took the billionaire to him. That Sufi fakir, Nasruddin was sitting under a tree. The sun was setting. The villagers said, “This is that man.” That billionaire threw down his bag full of gold and diamonds, jewels, and said, “I am ready to give all this. There is wealth worth crores in it. I want a glimpse of bliss.” That fakir looked at him from top to bottom. He said, “You want a true glimpse?” He said, “Yes, a true glimpse.” He was able to utter only that much, when the fakir grabbed the bag and ran away. For a moment that rich man stood there dumb-founded and then started crying, “I am ruined, I am dead.” But till then the fakir had gone far away into the darkness. The villagers knew that fakir, that he would do something absurd. They said, “We told you right in the beginning that this is the man who can answer absurd questions.” The rich man said, “Is this an answer! Catch him!” The people ran. The rich man also ran. The village was known to that fakir. He started eluding them by running through the alleys. The whole village woke up. He eluded everybody just to wake up the whole village. Then the whole village was running. Then running he came to the same place, the tree under which the horse was standing. He threw the bag down from where he had picked it up and stood under the tree. The rich man, huffing, puffing, perspiring, reached there. He saw the bag, picked it up, hugged it and said to god, “A great thanks to you!” That fakir said from behind the tree, “Did you get a glimpse?” The rich man said, “Yes, I definitely did. I experienced great bliss.” That fakir said, “So now get on your horse and go.”\nThe thing that we own, until we lose that also, we do not know. The whole journey of this world is of losing that which we have to attain. What we already have, we are not aware of it till we lose it once. We have lost it, we will have to search for it. The day we find it then except for drinking tea and laughing, nothing will remain.\nIn China, when three saints attained to enlightenment, they started roaming in villages, laughing\n. And whenever somebody asked them, they laughed. One laughed, the second laughed, all three laughed, then the laughter would spread in the whole village, then people would gather at the crossroad and laugh. People asked them that why are you laughing, then they used to look at\neach other and laugh. And then a wave of laughter would spread everywhere. Then those three became famous in whole China as “Three laughing saints”. Before dying they left a paper with this written on it, “We laugh at ourselves because what we were searching for, we already had, and we laugh at you that what you are searching for, you already have it.\nThese nine sutras I said to you in these four days. Not because your knowledge may increase. Not because you may become more knowledgeable. You are already very knowledgeable, you all are. Nothing will be achieved by making any addition to this knowledge of so many lives. I said these sutras to you, not to increase your knowledge, but to take away your knowledge from you. I have not said these sutras so that you may get some doctrines and become dependent on them. You already have many doctrines and many scriptures to depend on and if you had saved yourself from those, even then you might have been saved. You will not be saved by being dependent on these few words of mine.\nAll the doctrines, all the scriptures, all the words become a burden on your head and drown you.\n\u003c Previous | Contents\n","wordCount":"8742","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/sun_of_consciousness/part6/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/sun_of_consciousness/>Sun of Consciousness</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">6 The Sutra of Ultimate Life</h1><div class=post-meta>42 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;8742 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Sun_of_Consciousness/part6.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part5>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a></p><p><span id=bookmark5>‌</span>CHAPTER <span class=s3>6</span></p><p><br></p><p>The Sutra of Ultimate Life</p><p><br></p><p>20 October 1970 pm in Poona, India</p><p><br></p><p>[Note: This is a translation from the Hindi Neo-Yoga Sutras, which is
in the process of being edited. It is for research only.]</p><p><br></p><p>My Beloved Ones,</p><p><br></p><p>The eighth sutra of Yoga. In the seventh sutra I told you, that
conscious life has two forms - self- conscious and self unconscious. The
eighth sutra is: Yoga begins from self consciousness and ends in
dissolution of self. To be self conscious is the way, to become free
from self is the goal. To be full of consciousness for the self is
meditation and finally only consciousness remains and the self
disappears, that is enlightenment.</p><p><br></p><p>Those who do not know themselves, they are certainly backward, those
who get stuck at themselves, they also lag behind. Just as if someone,
after climbing the ladder, remains on the ladder then the climb becomes
useless. One has to climb on the ladder and one also has to leave the
ladder. If he stops on the way, then also he does not reach to the goal.
One has to walk on the path and one also has to leave the path. Then one
reaches the goal. The path can lead you upto the goal only if you are
prepared to leave the path. And the path will become a barrier in
reaching the goal if one insists on staying on it.</p><p><br></p><p>To be full of consciousness for the self is helpful in order to
dissolve the self. But if self itself is held on to, then that which is
helpful, the same becomes an obstacle. Perhaps it is most important to
understand this sutra. It is our earnest desire to attain to ourselves
but to dissolve oneself is a difficult thing. That is why many seekers
reach the seventh sutra but are unable to enter into the</p><p>eighth. Upto the seventh sutra there is no barrier to our ego. The
journey upto the seventh sutra is ego-centered. Hence upto the seventh
sutra if the seeker is asked to renounce wealth, he will renounce
wealth. If he is asked to give up his family, he will renounce his
family. If he is asked to give up fame, ambition, the throne, he will
give up all that. But behind all this renounciation, the ego goes on
becoming stronger.</p><p>He will be interested in meditation so that ‘I’ becomes more
enhanced. He will be engaged in meditation so that I become something.
He will search for the divine so that he does not remain without it.
There is no difficulty, no obstacle to come upto the seventh sutra. The
real problem is understanding the eighth sutra after the seventh sutra
because the eighth sutra is of losing oneself, of dissolving oneself.
Upto the seventh sutra one can attain great powers. Upto the seventh
sutra boundless energy will be born but there will be no becoming one
with the divine. Upto the seventh sutra one will meet oneself only.</p><p>Even meeting with oneself is not a small thing, it is very big. But
it is big in the context of the last six sutras, in the context of the
eighth sutra, it is not a big thing. Attaining to oneself is difficult.
To know oneself totally is also very difficult, but it is much more
difficult to lose and dissolve even oneself. If a person is imprisoned
in a prison then the first condition for him to become free of the
prison will be that he realises that he is in a prison. If he does not
realise that he is in a prison then there is no way for him to get out
of the prison. The first condition for him to get out of the prison will
be to know that I am in a prison. The second condition would be to know
the prison well, that what it really is? Where there is a wall? Where
there is a way? Where there are windows? Where there is glass? Where
there is the weak point from where it is possible to escape, where are
the guards? The second sutra will be to become completely familiar with
the prison, to be totally aware of the prison, only then it is possible
to get rid of the prison.</p><p>Deep down inside man self is the prison, in the self ego is the only
prison. It seems to be a small prison but it is big. It is full of great
energies, full of great treasures, but still it is a prison. Out of it,
is the vast expansion of existencewhere there is freedom, where there is
liberation. First of all we are not aware of our own self, that which is
so big. To get to know it gets completed upto the seventh sutra. And
when you come to know it completely then there is danger, great danger,
I will tell you about that danger. One who manages to get across that
danger will be able to understand the seventh sutra. The moment you
become aware that I am the master of so many treasures, so many jewels,
so much wealth, the prison starts looking like an emperor’s palace and
not a prison anymore. Even if a prisoner comes to know that there are so
many treasures in the prison, so much gold, so much wealth, if he comes
to know about the treasures of the prison then probably he would also
say no to the fact that this is a prison and say that this is an
emperor’s palace. And perhaps this treasure only, will now become a
barrier in his getting out of the prison. It is possible that the guards
may not have been able to stop him, chains may not have stopped him, all
the arrangements of the prison may not have stopped him from escaping
but the treasures found by him in the prison can stop him.</p><p>The day we come to know about the whole treasure of our being, the
entire power of our bliss, the danger is that we may forget that this
self is a very small piece of land, it is a very small part of the vast
infinite land. It is as if somebody has filled water in an earthen pot
and dropped it into the ocean. The water which is inside the earthen pot
is also of the ocean. But how can there be any comparison between the
water of the ocean inside the earthen pot and the ocean outside the
earthen pot!</p><p>We are also earthen pots. There is plenty inside. It is a part of the
divine, a part of the ocean but how can it be compared with what is
outside? The earthen pot has also to be broken one day. This self, this
‘I’, this ego is surrounding you. But the day you come to know the
entire beauty of the self, that day the earthen pot becomes a pot made
of gold. It becomes very difficult to break it. That is why many times
strange kinds of egos are born in a seeker. Many times the last thing
which stops the seeker on his path of meditation is that place where his
‘I’ becomes of gold, where he feels that I am the master of infinite
energy, infinite knowledge, infinite power. This declaration becomes
very deep declaration of his inner ‘I’. Those who stop at this, stop at
the seventh sutra. And this stopping is just as if a person after coming
closer to his destination stops at the gate. He completes the whole
journey but stops outside the destination. And this does happen. A
person walks thousands of miles but as he comes clser to his
destination, it becomes difficult to take even a single step. He is able
to walk for miles, he is able to run till the destination is far away
but as it starts coming closer, exhaustion starts taking over. It has
happened quite often that just after coming outside their destinations,
people have gone on to rest.</p><p>Many seekers get stuck at the seventh sutra. The eighth sutra is a
jump. A big jump. The fact of attaining is not such a big thing, the
fact of losing yourself is much bigger. Then the question arises in the
mind why to lose oneself? If we are not there ourselves then whatever
there will be what is its meaning, its purpose? If the self will not be
there then what will be enlightenment, what will be the divine, what
will be Yoga, what will be religion? Freedom can be dropped for the
self. Freedom from the self is a very difficult thing. Freedom for the
self is very easy, your mind feels that I should become free, liberated.
But in freedom from the self, you get stuck. Mind is ready for that last
jump. But Yoga has a way with which that last jump can be completed.</p><p>The most important search that starts for entering the eighth sutra
after the seventh sutra is of ‘Who am I?’ The search for this starts.
‘What am I?’, you come to know till the seventh sutra. But ‘Who am I?’,
you do not know till the seventh sutra. The search for ‘Who am I?’,
becomes the eighth sutra. And the deeper we search, the more we find
that my end is not here also, I am not only till here but beyond this
also, beyond and beyond. The search goes on and on and all the
boundaries get dissolved, and in the end you come to know that whatever
there is, I am all that. The day you come to know that whatever there is
I am all that, that day ‘I’ does not remain because only ‘You’ remains.
No ‘You’ remains in the outside world. Everything is ‘I’.</p><p>At the time of revolution in 1857, British soldiers had killed a
sannyasin. He had been silent for thirty years. People had asked him,
“Why are you becoming silent?” He had said, “What I want to say, I
cannot say because words are incapable and what I can say, I don’t want
to say because it is futile.” And then for thirty years he was silent.
He used to wander around, naked, silent. Once in the night he was
walking on the road and nearby there was a British camp. They caught him
thinking him to be a detective. They asked him many times, “Who are
you?”. But whenever they asked him, “Who are you?, he laughed. He was in
silence so he could not answer also. And who has been able to answer the
question of”Who am I?” till now? And the answer has been impossible to
give. When you find the answer, the answer is no more there.</p><p>So this puzzle has not been solved yet and will never be solved. When
the seeker gets dissolved only then the answer is achieved. But then the
answer no longer means anything. And till the seeker exists, the answer
cannot be found. So the answer cannot be given because it has not been
found.</p><p>He used to laugh heartily. The more he laughed, the more angry the
soldiers got and in the end they</p><p>plunged the bayonet in his chest. They thought that he was deceiving
them. At the time of his death he did say two words- he broke his thirty
years silence at the time of his death. And the breaking of his silence
of thirty years was really strange. And the answer that he had given was
even more strange, because the soldiers were asking him, “Who are you?”
He did not give any answer to this. At the time of his death he opened
his eyes and laughed again and he had used a great line from the
Upanishad. He had said to the British soldiers who had plunged the
bayonet in him, “That art thou, white man, you are also that! They had
asked,”Who are you?” He had replied at the time of his death, “You are
also that.”He had not said, “Whoever I am, you are also that.” The rest
he dropped, that is understood. He dropped saying I am also that because
who will say, “I am that”, there is no ‘I’ left. He had replied in a
round-about-way. He said, “You are also that, That art thou.”</p><p><br></p><p>Who knows, maybe the soldiers did not get the hint, it is difficult
that they could have understood. “Who am I?” In the end, this search
becomes in the disappearance of ‘I’. The search for it can only be done
after the seventh sutra, before that it is very difficult. It is easy
after the seventh sutra. Now we can ask because now we are awake, now we
are filled with light, we can ask, “Who am I?” And this question is the
only religious question. You can never find its answer. It is not that
you get the answer that you are god. Till you get this answer,
understand that it is your mind answering. The scriptures you have read,
they are answering. The words you have heard, they are answering. The
doctrines that you have learnt, they are answering.</p><p><br></p><p>That eighth sutra does not get solved by scriptures, will not get
solved by doctrines. So if your mind gives the answer to this eighth
sutra that you are Brahma or what I said just now’That art thou’, you
must have also read it, then that is not the solution. You ask yourself,
“Who am I?” and the mind says, “You are that”, that is also not the
solution. Till you can give the answer, you will not find the answer
because you don’t have the answer, you only have words. “Who am I?”,
this question should go so deep in you that the answer does not arise in
you, only the question remains - only a silent question remains. Each
breath starts asking, “Who am I?”,every core starts asking, “Who am I?”,
every heartbeat starts asking, “Who am I?” - sitting, standing, walking,
questioning or not questioning; only one question starts echoing in your
mind, “Who am I?” And you don’t find any answer. There is no answer
because if you have the answer with you then there is no need to
ask.</p><p><br></p><p>But all of us have answers, that is why in the eighth sutra all
scriptures become barriers. All knowledge becomes a barrier. That which
we call knowledge, all that we have learnt, understood, memorized, all
becomes a barrier. Even the greatest words become barriers-Geeta, Kuran,
Bible all become barriers. Whatever we have read, whatever we have
learnt, all starts becoming a barrier in the eighth sutra because it is
our memory which answers that I am this, I am this, I am this. All these
answers have to be destroyed. These answers are not ours. Those who have
given them, must have known before giving them, must have understood
before giving them but these answers are not ours. This answer is not
mine. This knowing is not mine, it is borrowed, it is stale.</p><p><br></p><p>Before this eighth sutra, a person will have to drop all knowledge
and become totally ignorant. And one who is capable of becoming ignorant
- this ignorant is of a completely different kind. Socrates has made a
small, very beautiful distinction. And the people who have reached near
the eighth sutra, Socrates is one of them. Some people of the village
went to Socrates and said, “The Goddess of Delphi has declared that no
one is wiser than Socrates.” They said, “These are the words of the
Goddess of Delphi that no one is wiser than Socrates! - what do you
say?”Socrates said, “Somewhere or the other, there has been some mistake
because I say to you that no one is more</p><p>ignorant than Socrates.” The people said, “This is a difficult
situation. Now if we believe the Goddess of Delphi then we will have to
believe Socrates also. And Socrates says that no one is more ignorant
than Socrates. And if we believe Socrates that no one is more ignorant
than Socrates then what about Delphi’s words. Socrates has put us into
difficulty.”</p><p><br></p><p>Socrates said, “It is my job to put you into difficulty. I also faced
many difficulties before it became possible for me to reach here.” But
they asked, “What should we believe?” Socrates said, “Go back and ask
the Goddess of Delphi.” They went back and asked the Goddess of Delphi,
“Socrates says no one is more ignorant than me and you say that no one
is wiser than him.” The Goddess of Delphi said, “That is why, that is
why I say that nobody is wiser than him because one who has come to know
about one’s own ignorance, he is standing at the door of knowledge.”
They came back and said to Socrates, “The Goddess says that is why. Now
the puzzle has become more complicated. She says that Socrates can call
himself ignorant because he is standing at the door of his destination.”
Socrates said, “Did you notice that when you came and told me I thought
from where did the Goddess of Delphi get this wrong notion?”</p><p><br></p><p>But her words were very meaningful. In these words she had not said
that Socrates is the wisest. She had said that no one was wiser than
Socrates. She had said the negative. She had not said that he was the
wisest.</p><p><br></p><p>So Socrates said, “You went back to the Goddess, I went to enquire in
the village if there was anybody wiser than me or not? So I went and
asked each and every person. They had answers to all the questions
except they did not have the answer to the question, ‘Who are you?’ ‘Who
am I?’, they did not have any answer to this question. So I said to them
that what kind of wise people are you? who still don’t know who we are?
what is the meaning of their knowing anything else? Those who have not
yet been able to know who I am, what else will they be able to know? I
went to each and every wise person and came back.” And then he said,
“The Goddess is very clever. She said that nobody is wiser than
Socrates.” The only meaning of this is that everybody is ignorant in the
village but only Socrates is aware that he is ignorant. There is no
other meaning. Nobody in the village has even this much knowledge.</p><p><br></p><p>Only the person who experiences his ignorance will be able to get
across the seventh sutra. One who becomes aware that I don’t know
anything. Not even who I am. And when you come to know it deeply,
intensely, then its pain is utterly exquisite. The pain of ‘who am I’
spreads into each and every core. Then it does not remain a question,
then it does not remain an intellectual enquiry. Then it does not remain
an existential question which has an answer somewhere. Then it becomes
the craving of your being, the thirst of your being, then it becomes a
continuous anticipation of your being. The being starts trembling with
only one burning desire, to know:“Who am I?” And you don’t find any
answer anywhere, there is no answer anywhere. One who will get the
answer from somewhere is deceiving himself. There is no answer
anywhere.</p><p><br></p><p>When you do not find any answer anywhere and the question goes on
hurting, drives you mad, destroys you inside; when the question remains
only a question, even the hope of getting an answer fades away, the
possibility of an answer fades away, the expectation of an answer also
fades away; that you will find an answer when that possibility also
fades away, only the question remains, rather it should be said that
when the questioner and the queation become one, at that moment the
question also disappears. You do not find an answer, the question is
also dropped. Unquestioning, in that</p><p>moment the person enters into the eighth sutra from the seventh
sutra. At that moment he does not ask, “Who am I?”, at that moment he
says, “Tell me that which I am not.” At that moment he asks, “Where I am
not?”</p><p>Nanak went and slept outside the temple of Mecca. His feet were
towards the holy stone of Mecca. The priests came and said, “Remove your
feet. Idiot, you don’t even know that you should not point your feet
towards the holy stone. He points his feet towards the divine.” Nanak
said, “I am in a diliema. You point my feet in the direction where there
is no divine. Grab my feet and point them where there is no divine.”
Those priests got into great difficulty. They did not dare to point
Nanak’s feet anywhere else because the divine is everywhere.</p><p>The day the very question “Who am I?” is dropped, that day there
remains no concern anymore about “Who am I?” That day even if somebody
questioned it, our only answer will be: “Who am I not? I am everything.”
That day the barrier of the wall of ‘self’ standing in between
disappears. It crumbles. It is absolutely a wall of dreams. It is a wall
of thoughts, a wall of memories, a wall of beliefs, you have believed
that you are like this and this and that is why the wall is there. This
wall crumbles. The moment it crumbles, the person becomes one with the
infinite. Then the self- centered personality disappears.</p><p>It is not that you get destroyed. It is not that you are finished.
No, you are still there, and with more totality. But you do not remain
‘I’, you become everything. Then you do not remain a wave, then you
become the ocean. Then you do not remain a drop, you become the
vastness. You die as ‘I’ but become like the divine. That is why nothing
is lost by losing the ‘I’. Just as nobody loses anything by waking up
from a night’s dream, in the same way nobody loses anything by waking up
from the dream of ‘I’. He gains something by waking up from a night’s
dream, some awakening. He also gains something by waking up from the
dream of ‘I’, a divine life. The insignificant barrier breaks down. That
meaningless cycle breaks. That dividing line of ‘I’ gets dissolved.
There is no need for it now. It was needed till the seventh step, till
the seventh sutra, it was needed. The journey till now has been
completed with the help of this ‘I’. If that ‘I’ is not there then that
much journey cannot be completed. Lies also help in the journey,
illusions also help in the journey. They cannot take you to the
destination, they cannot go with you to the destination.</p><p>One Christian priest was imprisoned in a Russian jail for twenty
years. He has written a very unique book “In God’s Underground”. He was
a beautiful man that he called his prison which was a dark cell under
the ground, “In God’s Underground” and wrote a small book. That was also
God’s hidden house under the ground. He was imprisoned in a dark cell
for twenty years. Food used to be thrown in once a day, but he did not
hear anyone’s voice. But after five-seven days suddenly somebody started
knocking at the wall from next door. He tried to understand but what
could he understand from the knocking. But he understood this much that
there was another prisoner next door. Then for twenty years, they lived
together with a wall in the middle. Then they slowly invented a language
by knocking. one knock for A, two knocks for B, three for C-this kind of
language they slowly developed. Then they got to know each other’s name
and started giving messages to each other. Then they also started
greeting each other after getting up in the morning. Then they started
wishing good-night to each other at night. Then their communication
gathered speed, a code was developed. If these two persons come out of
the prison then will they still talk by knocking on the wall? No, they
will not. They had to develop a sign language without which it was not
possible to talk through the wall.</p><p>A person’s ‘I’ is also a code language which has to be used all
around the world where we are</p><p>enclosed in our own walls, where we have to knock and talk to each
other. So we name the other, we call somebody Ram, somebody Krishna,
somebody something else and so on. All names are false. No child is born
with a name, but without a name it would be very difficult to talk
through walls. So Krishna means two knocks. Ram means three knocks. So
we get acquainted with each other by knocking that if we knock three
times then know that we are calling you. You are now Ram and you
Krishna. We stick names on people, this is a code language, where there
is no other way to talk through walls. We give everybody a name. If I
want to call somebody then I say, “Ram, come here.” I can also have a
name. I have a name but if I call out my name then it would be very
difficult to make out whether I am calling someone else or myself. That
is why the code-language is two-sided. When I want to call myself then I
say ‘I’ and when I want to call somebody else then I call out his name.
When you also want to call yourself you also say ‘I’ and when you want
to call someone else you call out their name.</p><p><br></p><p>Swami Ram went to America, he used to call himself Ram. He had
stopped saying “I”. Naturally if you break the code language, there will
be difficulty. He used to call himself Ram. If somebody used to laugh on
the way or somebody swore at him, he used to come back and say, “Today,
Ram was in a great difficulty. Some people came-by and started
swearing.” So people who were unacquainted, in America used to ask,
“What do you mean? What are you saying? Ram who?” Then he used to say,
“This Ram.” They were in great difficulty. Slowly they understood the
code that this man calls himself Ram.</p><p><br></p><p>But whether we call ourselves ‘Ram’ or say ‘I’, give ourselves a name
or use a pronoun, use ‘I’ – we are born neither with ‘I’ nor with a
name. Children come to know about ‘you’ first. Later on they come to
know about ‘I’. Children become ‘thou’conscious first, first they come
to know about others, ’I’, they come to know later. When ‘you’ becomes
very certain, that is why sometimes some children are heard saying, “He
is hungry.” Small children will say, “Who is hungry?”, ‘I’ has not
developed yet. ‘I’ has to develop.</p><p><br></p><p>In the communication of this life where each of us is enclosed in a
circle of his own, in walls of his own, a code language has to be
developed. ‘I’ is an indicator, is a hint towards whom even I don’t know
that who he is. Krishna, Ram are indicators towards whom even I don’t
know who he is. We are all standing on the other side of the wall. We
are all like prisoners who go on knocking at our own walls. But life is
like that, we do not understand this because we move carrying our cells,
our walls with ourselves. ‘Those prisoners are imprisoned, the walls are
fixed at one place.’</p><p><br></p><p>Right from birth we carry our prisons with ourselves, that is why we
never come to know that I am carrying my walls with me. A husband and
wife, their whole life, go on talking in code language through two
walls, which is understood only once in a while, and when it is not
understood, then it is not understood. A father and son also talk,
friends also talk but through walls. They knock saying something else,
the other understands something else. He knocks in fear and they
understand something else on the other side. But they forget one thing
that both ‘I’ and ‘you’ are utilitarian words, not the truth. They have
utility, but they are not the truth.</p><p><br></p><p>That is why the moment we start searching for ‘I’, we will find that
‘I’ is nowhere to be found. It is nowhere to be found. Just as the man
whose name is Krishna, if he goes inside himself in search of Krishna,
then would he find Krishna anywhere? That label is stuck outside the
container. If you go searching for it inside, you will not find it
anywhere. ‘I’ is also nowhere inside. They are utilitarian</p><p>words, inventions of language but are not important. And till the
seventh sutra, the seeker is not hindered by them, in fact they help
him, because he comes till the seventh sutra in the search of ‘I’ only.
Power for ‘I’, peace for ‘I’, freedom for ‘I’, the divine for ‘I’, he
comes in search of these till the seventh sutra. Till the seventh ‘I’ is
utilitarian not the truth. After the seventh ‘I’ starts becoming a
barrier, its utility has gone waste now. At the eighth that code
language has to be broken. There is pain when you break it at the
eighth, because we did everything for this ‘I’, we lived for this ‘I’,
we died for this ‘I’, just for this ‘I’ who knows how many times we took
birth.</p><p>A fakir went to China from India. His name was Bodhidharma. The
Emperor of China had come to welcome him. On the way to entering the
kingdom, the Emperor who had come to welcome him, saw his chance and
said to him, “I am very disturbed, please tell me some way.” Bodhidharma
said, “Come tomorrow morning at three o’clock and I will make you
peaceful.” That Emperor had asked that question to many fakirs and they
had given him different ways, but this man seemed to be strange. He
said, “Come tomorrow morning at three o’clock and I will make you
peaceful. He had his doubts also that this matter cannot be so easy. He
had been disturbed his whole life, had tried many ways, but he did not
attain peace. He said again to Bodhidharma,”Perhaps you do not know
about my difficulty. Whatever wealth I need, I have attained it, but I
cannot find peace. Whatever fasting fakirs told me to do, I did, but I
cannot find peace. I have built lakhs of temples, but I cannot find
peace. Whatever good deeds I was told to do, I did their double, but I
cannot find peace.”</p><p>That fakir said, “No more talk, come tomorrow morning at three
o’clock and I will make you peaceful.” He felt amazed. He thought,
alright, we will see at three o’clock. Now he felt doubtful that whether
it is even right to go to this man or not. He was coming down the stairs
of the temple where Bodhidharma was staying, he had just reached the
last step when Bodhidharma shouted and said, “Listen, bring”I” with you,
otherwise who shall I make peaceful.” He thought, “More madness!” He
thought that when I will come then “I” will naturally be with me.
Bodhidharma said, “Remember to bring it, don’t leave it at home.” In the
night the Emperor thought about it many times that whether he should go
or not but thought he had never encountered a man who said that he would
make him peaceful.</p><p>In the morning, gathering all his courage, he came at three o’clock.
He started climbing the stairs. He had not even climbed the first stair
when Bodhidharma said, “Did you bring”I” with you or not?” Emperor Wu
said, “Why are you joking with me, when I have come then what is the
question of bringing”I” with me?” Bodhidharma said, “I ask deliberately
– I am here and I can see it but still my”I” is not with me now. That is
why I asked whether you had brought it with you or not, otherwise who
will I make peaceful?” Emperor Wu could not understand what Bodhidharma
was saying. Then again Bodhidharma said, “Alright, now that you have
come. And you say that you have brought it with you, then sit. Close
your eyes and look for your”I”, where it is and then get hold of it and
give it to me so that I can make it peaceful.</p><p>He said to Bodhidharma, “I was doubtful last night only that I should
not go. What are you talking about? Is”I” something that I can catch
hold of and give to you?” Then Bodhidharma said, “Alright, if you cannot
give it to me then at least you yourself can catch hold of it inside
you?” The Emperor said, “I have never tried it.” Bodhidharma said, “Then
try it.” The emperor is sitting there with his eyes closed and
Bodhidharma is sitting in front of him with a big stick in his hand.</p><p>The emperor was feeling scared also. It is night, it is dark and he
had come alone trusting that monk. Who knows, what he intends to do?
Bodhidharma would sometimes move his head with the stick</p><p>and say, “Search, don’t miss any corner. Wherever you find it, grab
it.” Half an hour has passed, quarter of an hour has passed, an hour has
passed, two hours have passed and that emperor has got lost somewhere!
The morning sun started rising. Bodhidharma said, “Now should I take my
bath and do other things? You have not been able to catch it till now?”
The emperor opened his eyes and fell at Bodhidharma’s feet. He said, “I
had never noticed that there is no such thing as”I” inside. When I went
to look, it was nowhere to be found. I looked into every nook and
corner. Everywhere I looked, but “I” is nowhere to be found.</p><p><br></p><p>Then Bodhidharma, “Now whom should I make peaceful? I am sitting here
with this stick in my hand for three hours.” The emperor said, “Now it
has become silent, because when”I” is not there, then what kind of
disturbance can there be? These three hours were the hours of my silence
only. As I started looking and as I started becoming aware that I am not
achieving, something went on becoming silent. Now I can say that it was
wrong to say that I was disturbed. ‘I’ itself was the disturbance.
Bodhidharma said, “Go and beware of”I” in the future, don’t cling on to
it again.</p><p><br></p><p>Emperor Wu has got it written on his grave that I heard words of
lakhs of sannyasins and saints, I heard thousands of scriptures, but I
could not catch hold of the secret. And then after coming in contact
with a strange fakir, I looked inside and all the secrets came out into
the open. There was no ‘I’ which had to be made silent. There was no ‘I’
which had to be purified. There was no ‘I’ which had to fought with and
conquered. There was no ‘I’ for which God and enlightenment had to be
found. There was no ‘I’ there.</p><p><br></p><p>The eighth sutra is the sutra of looking for “I” and then losing the
“I”. The moment “I” is lost, everything is attained. “I” means that we
are holding on to something against everybody. If we say “I” rightly,
then “I” means a point of resistance.</p><p><br></p><p>We are holding on to this ‘I’ against everybody, in enmity with
everybody. We have dropped everybody and caught hold of this “I”. This
“I” is just like the boundaries of countries – India, Pakistan. If we go
looking, then there is no boundary where India ends and Pakistan begins.
There is no boundary anywhere, there is no boundary where India ends and
China begins except in the minds of the politicians. These boundaries
are nowhere. And it would have been alright if the politicians had any
brains. There are no boundaries except on the political maps. Go up, if
you look from above from the sky, then there is no India, no Pakistan,
no China, no Japan. There are no boundaries. If there is somebody on
Mars and looking towards the earth then will he be able to see any
boundaries?</p><p>When Yuri Gagarin went into the space for the first time, his
countrymen were expecting that he would send some message from there,
from the space, that he would shout ‘Long live Soviet Russia’, that he
sould say something like that. But the first words that came out of Yuri
Gagarin’s mouth are worth understanding. “My Russia” did not come out of
Yuri Gagarin’s mouth, the words which came out of his mouth were “My
World”, “My Earth”. Looking from such a great height, no country
remained. Looking from such a great height, the whole earth had become
one, the whole world had become one. The words that he said were, “My
World! My Earth!” When he returned, Moscow asked him, “Why did’nt you
say, ‘My Russia?’” He said, “No Russia remained from there. All the
boundaries were lost there!”</p><p>In the same way when one goes into the inner sky, the boundaries of
“I” and “You” are lost there. They are also man’s utilitarian boundaries
drawn on a map. Just as my house makes a false</p><p>boundary, my “I” also makes that false boundary. Just as my country
makes a false boundary, my “I” also makes a false boundary. But these
lies will work only till the seventh sutra, not after the seventh sutra.
If you want to walk on the earth, if you want to walk horizontally, then
Russia, India and Pakistan will walk, but if you want to make a vertical
flight, then Russia, India will be lost. One who wants to rise high in
the inner sky, his “I” and “You” all will be lost, and when “I” and
“You” are lost then that which remains, the remaining is the divine.
This is the eighth sutra.</p><p><br></p><p>And the ninth sutra is a small one, I will finish my talk after
telling you about it.</p><p><br></p><p>The first sutra, I had said, was life energy. The ninth sutra is of
yoga. Death is also energy. Death too is energy. It is not that only
life is energy, death too is energy. It is not that only life is life,
death too is life. And it is not that only life is worth liking, death
too is very beautiful. It is not that only life is worth welcoming,
death also needs an open door. And one who does not accept death will
remain deprived of life. And one who accepts death will be entitled to
the ultimate life.</p><p><br></p><p>Death too is energy, death too is divine, death too is god. It is the
ultimate sutra of yoga. It is the last sutra. One who will be able to
see death in the same way as life; it is like that, it is just a
question of seeing it. And after the eighth sutra, it will be possible
to see. The day you come to know that there is no “I”, that day you will
come to know, whose death? What kind of death? Who will die? Who can
die? Till the people say that I will not die, I am immortal, my soul is
immortal, till then understand that all that talk is just what they have
heard. When someone says that there is no “I” and what is there is
divine, then understand that this is something. I want to be immortal
but I am not there. One who wants to become immortal is not there and
one who is immortal, we do not know about it.</p><p><br></p><p>At the time of Ramakrishna’s death, it had become clear three days
before that Ramakrishna is taking leave now. So his wife Sharda became
very worried and upset. Ramakrishna asked her, “Why do you cry? Because
the one who is, is not going to die. And did you love this body known as
me or did you love the one who is?” Sharda said, “I loved the one who
is.” Ramakrishna said, “Then drop the worry. Then, when he who is not
dies, do not break your bangles.” There was only one widow in India who
did not break her bangles after her husband’s death Then Ramakrishna
died. Everybody else cried and wept but Sharda did not agree to break
her bangles. She remained the same as she always was. Everybody said,
“What are you doing? Ramakrishna is dead.” She said, “One who has died
was not there in the first place, and the one who was there, still is.
These bangles are in this memory. Sharda remained a bride even after
Ramakrishna’s death. She never said that Ramakrishna is dead and
whenever somebody asked she would say,”That body had become worn and
torn, he has only changed clothes.” In reality, only clothes are
changed, only garbs are changed.</p><p><br></p><p>The day you come to know this – you will know at the eighth sutra
that I am not there, then who will die? Then where is death? Then there
is no way to die. Then if someone cuts with a sword then who will be
cut? He can only cut “I”, who else? When there is no “I”, then there is
nobody to be cut. What Krishna said to Arjuna that neither anybody dies
nor anybody kills – its meaning is only this much that there is nobody.
The shadows which are seen become small and large with the rising and
setting of the sun. They are not there, they become small and large with
the sun’s shadow.</p><p><br></p><p>Gibran has written a story that a fox has come out in search of food.
The sun is awake and is behind the fox. The fox’s shadow falls very big
like big tall trees. The fox thought today I will need a lot of food. I
have such a big body. The fox does not have any mirror to see her body,
she has only her</p><p>shadow. And even in the mirror only the shadow will be visible, what
else? And one who is standing on the other side of the mirror, it is
said by those who know, that he is also a shadow. She had seen her
shadow, long shadow like the trees. She thought in her mind, “This is a
great difficulty. Today I will have to search for bigger food. I will
need at least a camel. She went on searching, then it was afternoon and
the sun came overhead. The shadow shrank and became small. The fox
looked down and said,”I am very hungry. Now even if I find something
small, it will do. The shadow has shrunk. It has become small. But that
fox believes the shadow to be its being.</p><p><br></p><p>What we call body, in a very deep dimension is not more than a
shadow. A shadow materialized. A shadow, which has become visible
because of the density of energy particles. The coming and going of that
shadow. But till “I” is there, till then there is identity with that
shadow.</p><p><br></p><p>The ninth sutra is, death too is life, death too is energy, death too
is the divine. And one who knows death too as the divine attains to
enlightenment. Enlightenment means, there is no death for such a person.
Enlightenment means such death where there is no death.</p><p><br></p><p>I said to you these nine sutras of yoga. These nine sutras can be
said in twelve dimensions, can be said in twelve different ways. I said
in only one way. These nine sutras can be said in twelve different ways.
And when you multiply twelve with nine it becomes one hundred and eight.
The malas with one hundred and eight beads that you have seen in the
necks of sannyasins are nothing more than a symbol of these nine sutras
which can be said in twelve ways. And below those 108 beads you must
have also seen the one hundred ninth part which is known as sumeru.
Anybody starting from anywhere on these one hundred and eight ways will
reach to that same ultimate one. I said these nine sutras of yoga to you
only in one dimension. They can be said in twelve ways, thus making for
108 methods of meditation. One method of meditation is developed from
each sutra. But from wherever one starts, he definitely reaches the same
place. Even if somebody does not start from anywhere, then too, wherever
he is standing, he is standing at the same place. The only difference is
that he does not come to know where he is standing.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard about one fakir that he used to just lie in the way of a
pilgrimage. The pilgrims used to climb and go on the top of the
mountain. They used to say to the fakir, “You go on lying there, go on
lying there, shouldn’t you climb up for the pilgrimage? So the fakir
used to say,”Where you are going, I am already there.” Then again while
returning when somebody asked him, “Will you go on lying here or climb
up and travel?” The fakir used to say, “From where you are coming, I am
there.” Those pilgrims would not understand and used to go away from
there.</p><p><br></p><p>The day you come to know, after the journey, you find it very funny.
Zen masters say that when you come to know you find it very funny. Zen
masters have a saying that ‘when you come to know then except for
laughing while sipping a cup of tea, nothing remains.’ When someone was
asking Rinzai, “What is this? What kind of talk is this that we have
heard that when you attain enlightenment then except for laughing and
sipping tea, nothing remains?” Rinzai said, “Really, nothing remains,
because when you come to know, then you also become aware that I was
like this always. What I have found, I already had it and what I
searched for, I had never lost it. But still you have to make such a
long journey.</p><p><br></p><p>A small story and then I will complete my talk.</p><p>I have heard, just before his death, a billionaire became aware that
he had never experienced bliss. He must have been fortunate. Some people
become aware only after death. He became aware before death that he had
not experienced bliss. Death was close-by. Astrologers said, “There are
not many days left, be quick.” He said, “I have been hurrying all my
life but where is bliss? And now I have the means to buy it. I am ready
to buy it at any cost.” Those astrologers said, “That we do not know. We
can only say that hurry because death is close-by. And if you come to
know, then let us know also because we will also have to hurry, death is
close-by. But he said,”But where should I look for it?” They said, “We
don’t know. You just go look for it, anywhere, just look for it.</p><p><br></p><p>He climbed his fastest horse. He put diamonds, jewels worth crores of
rupees on his horse and then going to each and every village started
shouting, “If somebody gives me a glimpse of bliss then I am ready to
give him all this.”</p><p><br></p><p>Then he reached a village, where there was a Sufi fakir. The people
of the village said, “You have come to the right place. There is a man
in this village who solves this kind of absurd problems.” He said,
“Absurd problems!” The people of that village said, “We have also learnt
a few absurd things by being in his company. One thing we have learnt,
it is quite absurd absurd because nobody can buy even a glimpse of bliss
with money, bliss is very far away. But still you have come, you did
right. You have come to the right place. There is such a man in this
village.</p><p><br></p><p>That man was searched for. The villagers took the billionaire to him.
That Sufi fakir, Nasruddin was sitting under a tree. The sun was
setting. The villagers said, “This is that man.” That billionaire threw
down his bag full of gold and diamonds, jewels, and said, “I am ready to
give all this. There is wealth worth crores in it. I want a glimpse of
bliss.” That fakir looked at him from top to bottom. He said, “You want
a true glimpse?” He said, “Yes, a true glimpse.” He was able to utter
only that much, when the fakir grabbed the bag and ran away. For a
moment that rich man stood there dumb-founded and then started crying,
“I am ruined, I am dead.” But till then the fakir had gone far away into
the darkness. The villagers knew that fakir, that he would do something
absurd. They said, “We told you right in the beginning that this is the
man who can answer absurd questions.” The rich man said, “Is this an
answer! Catch him!” The people ran. The rich man also ran. The village
was known to that fakir. He started eluding them by running through the
alleys. The whole village woke up. He eluded everybody just to wake up
the whole village. Then the whole village was running. Then running he
came to the same place, the tree under which the horse was standing. He
threw the bag down from where he had picked it up and stood under the
tree. The rich man, huffing, puffing, perspiring, reached there. He saw
the bag, picked it up, hugged it and said to god, “A great thanks to
you!” That fakir said from behind the tree, “Did you get a glimpse?” The
rich man said, “Yes, I definitely did. I experienced great bliss.” That
fakir said, “So now get on your horse and go.”</p><p><br></p><p>The thing that we own, until we lose that also, we do not know. The
whole journey of this world is of losing that which we have to attain.
What we already have, we are not aware of it till we lose it once. We
have lost it, we will have to search for it. The day we find it then
except for drinking tea and laughing, nothing will remain.</p><p><br></p><p>In China, when three saints attained to enlightenment, they started
roaming in villages, laughing</p><p>. And whenever somebody asked them, they laughed. One laughed, the
second laughed, all three laughed, then the laughter would spread in the
whole village, then people would gather at the crossroad and laugh.
People asked them that why are you laughing, then they used to look
at</p><p>each other and laugh. And then a wave of laughter would spread
everywhere. Then those three became famous in whole China as “Three
laughing saints”. Before dying they left a paper with this written on
it, “We laugh at ourselves because what we were searching for, we
already had, and we laugh at you that what you are searching for, you
already have it.</p><p><br></p><p>These nine sutras I said to you in these four days. Not because your
knowledge may increase. Not because you may become more knowledgeable.
You are already very knowledgeable, you all are. Nothing will be
achieved by making any addition to this knowledge of so many lives. I
said these sutras to you, not to increase your knowledge, but to take
away your knowledge from you. I have not said these sutras so that you
may get some doctrines and become dependent on them. You already have
many doctrines and many scriptures to depend on and if you had saved
yourself from those, even then you might have been saved. You will not
be saved by being dependent on these few words of mine.</p><p><br></p><p>All the doctrines, all the scriptures, all the words become a burden
on your head and drown you.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part5>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a></p><p>  </p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://osho.lol/posts/from_unconciousness_to_consciousness/part6/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>6 The so-called holy books are just religious pornography</span>

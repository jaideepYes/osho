THE RABBIT SAID, “WHAT ARE YOU?” THE FOX SAID, “I AM A FOX, AND I COULD EAT YOU UP IF I WANTED TO.”\n“HOW CAN YOU PROVE THAT YOU ARE A FOX?” ASKED THE RABBIT. THE FOX DIDN’T KNOW WHAT TO SAY, BECAUSE IN THE PAST RABBITS HAD ALWAYS RUN FROM HIM WITHOUT SUCH INQUIRIES.\nTHEN THE RABBIT SAID, “IF YOU CAN SHOW ME WRITTEN PROOF THAT YOU ARE A FOX, I’LL BELIEVE YOU.”\nSO THE FOX TROTTED OFF TO THE LION, WHO GAVE HIM A CERTIFICATE THAT HE WAS A FOX.\nWHEN HE GOT BACK TO WHERE THE RABBIT WAS WAITING, THE FOX STARTED TO READ OUT THE DOCUMENT. IT SO PLEASED HIM THAT HE DWELT OVER THE PARAGRAPHS WITH LINGERING DELIGHT. MEANWHILE, GETTING THE GIST OF THE MESSAGE FROM THE FIRST FEW LINES, THE RABBIT RAN DOWN A BURROW AND WAS NEVER SEEN AGAIN.\nTHE FOX WENT BACK TO THE LION’S DEN, WHERE HE SAW A DEER TALKING TO THE LION. THE DEER WAS SAYING, “I WANT TO SEE WRITTEN PROOF THAT YOU ARE A LION.”\nTHE LION SAID, “WHEN I AM NOT HUNGRY, I DON’T NEED TO BOTHER. WHEN I AM HUNGRY, YOU DON’T NEED ANYTHING IN WRITING.”\nTHE FOX SAID TO THE LION, ” WHY DIDN’T YOU TELL ME TO DO THAT, WHEN I ASKED FOR A CERTIFICATE FOR THE RABBIT?”\n“MY DEAR FRIEND,” SAID THE LION, “YOU SHOULD HAVE SAID THAT IT WAS REQUESTED BY A RABBIT. I THOUGHT THAT IT MUST BE FOR A STUPID HUMAN BEING, FROM WHOM SOME OF THESE IDIOTIC ANIMALS HAVE LEARNED THIS PASTIME.”\nMAN IS CONTINUOUSLY PREOCCUPIED WITH INVENTING A SELF FOR HIMSELF, but the\ninvented self can never be the real self. There is no possibility that the invented will ever be the real. The real self has to be discovered, not invented.\nThe invented self becomes our ego. The real self is not in any way the ego. The real self is not a self at all; it is utter emptiness, and the silence of emptiness, and the joy of emptiness.\nIf you want to invent a self you will have to ask others; that’s the only way to invent it – to gather opinions of what people think about you. That’s what we go on doing our whole lives. That’s why we are so afraid of people’s disrespect. That becomes our bondage. We want to be respectable, because if we are respectable then people’s opinion about us is beautiful. They praise us and we can have a better self. If we are not respectable people condemn; and then you will not ever have a beautiful self, you will have an ugly self. Your self consists only of the opinion s of others; it is a patchwork. A has said something, and B has said something else, and C something else, and so on, so forth. You collect all these things, these paper cuttings. Then you make an image out of them – you fix them together, you glue them together.\nFrom the very beginning the child starts collecting this rubbish. The mother says something, the father, the brother, the neighbors: if it is gratifying he starts feeling proud, if it is not gratifying he starts feeling depressed. To avoid depression he goes on flattering everybody that he meets. The flattery is nothing but an arrangement: “I will flatter you so that you can give me a good certificate. I will flatter you more if you are willing to give me an even better certificate.” But all these certificates are just from the outside, and nobody knows you, who you are – not even you yourself.\nSo what others say about you is almost irrelevant to your reality. They only know your appearance, and appearances can be very false. The person who looks very gentle on the outside may be very egoistic inside. That gentleness may be just a camouflage, a protection, an armor. The man who looks very clever on the outside may be just the opposite – he may be utterly stupid. The stupid person has to pretend cleverness; it hurts to know, “I am stupid.” The man who goes on bragging about his knowledge is bound to be ignorant. But who wants to be known as an ignorant person? – he collects some information and goes on broadcasting that information to people. Slowly, slowly he gathers a reputation that he knows, but this knowledge is false, this reputation is false. These certificates are given to you by people who don’t know you, who can’t know you. There is no way for anybody else to know you except yourself. And whatsoever they are saying, they are saying only so that you can give them a good certificate. So it is a mutual conspiracy; we are deceiving each other. Somebody says, “You are beautiful,” and of course you have to return the compliment. Somebody says, “You are so intelligent,” and you have to return the compliment: “You must be a very intelligent person, otherwise you would not have known about my intelligence. You must be a man of great understanding – you are the first man who has understood me.”\nThis constant preoccupation with inventing one’s own self has to be understood. Why is it there at all? It is there because you are feeling a constant gnawing emptiness within your heart. You don’t know who you are, and it is very difficult to live without knowing who you are. Unless you know who you are whatsoever you do is going to be a failure, a frustration.\nYou can succeed in being fulfilled only if you know who you are. Then you will choose your life in such a way that it becomes a fulfillment to your real needs. Otherwise, not knowing yourself, whatsoever you do remains accidental. Maybe once in a while your arrow may reach the target, but that is accidental and it will happen only once in a while. You are shooting in darkness, without knowing who you are, without knowing where the target is. It is almost impossible that sometimes it may hit the target; ninety-nine percent is the possibility that you will remain empty and you will die empty. Your life will be a tragedy. That’s why people carry such a tragic sense on their faces, in their eyes.\nWatch people, watch yourself, and you will see – people are living a very tragic existence. Their whole past has gone in vain and they know that today is also slipping out of their hands; and deep down the suspicion that whatsoever they have been doing in the past they are going to do in the future too. So it is all a meaningless journey, “a tale told by an idiot, full of fury and noise, signifying nothing”.\nAnd unless significance is felt, how can you be joyous? Unless your life throbs with significance how can it become a song? Only a significant life becomes a song. When you start feeling there is meaning, when you start feeling that you are fulfilling something very essential to existence – that you are needed, that you are part of this cosmic drama, this cosmic play, that without you something will be missing, that without you the drama will not be the same at all – then great respect arises towards oneself; and in that very respect gratitude towards existence, prayer, thankfulness.\nBut the most fundamental thing is to know oneself: Who am I. And to know oneself means to discover – because you are already there, you are not to be invented. Whatsoever you invent will be a fiction, will not be truth. And how can you delude yourself? Maybe for one day you can delude yourself, for two days, but for how long? Delusions wear out. They cannot remain against reality forever. Reality goes on asserting.\nAnd there are only two kinds of people in the world: the majority consists of those who invent the self, and a very small minority of those who discover the self. And the difference is vast, the difference is tremendous: they are two worlds apart. A Buddha, a Jesus, a Bahaudin, a Rumi, a Mansur – they discover.\nWhat do I mean by discovery? The first thing to remember is that you already have the self. You are. That needs no proof. That is indubitably there, you cannot even doubt it.\nThe great European philosopher, Descartes, says, “The only indubitable fact about life is that I am.” Only this cannot be doubted; everything else can be doubted. You can doubt the world; it may not be, it may be just a dream, as Hindus say – that it is maya, an illusion, a dream in God’s mind. Maybe, possibly; it cannot be denied, there is no way to deny it. That’s exactly what Berkeley says – that the world is not a real world, it is a fantasy, a thought, not a thing. Nobody has ever been able to refute Shankara or Berkeley. It cannot be refuted. How to refute it?\nBerkeley was walking with Doctor Johnson. Doctor Johnson was a realist. He was very offended by the Berkelinian idea that the world is only a thought, not a thing; that it is just a fiction, a mind projection – there are no trees outside, there are no people outside; only I am. Johnson, being a realist, was getting very angry, more so because he could not find how to refute this man logically, how to prove that the tree outside there was really there.…\nHow to prove it? – because in the dream also we see trees, and they look almost the same as these trees. And in the dream also we think that they are there; only in the morning when we wake up do we find that they were not there. Who knows? – when death comes and we wake up finally, we may come to know that all those trees, and the people, and the world, and the earth, and the moon, and the sun, were all just a long, long dream. How to prove it?\n... He took a rock from the road and hit Berkeley’s feet with the rock. Blood started oozing and Berkeley was in great pain and very angry too. He said, “What kind of behavior is this? What wrong have I done to you? Why have you hit me with the rock? I don’t see the point.”\nJohnson laughed and he said, “This is to refute your so-called idealism. Now if the rock is unreal, why are you crying? Why are there tears in your eyes? How can I hit with an unreal rock?”\nBerkeley started laughing. He said, “But my pain is unreal too, and my tears are unreal too. Only I am real. Who knows that the tears are flowing, that the blood is oozing, that the feet are hurting like hell? Only I who knows, the witness, is real. Everything else, Doctor Johnson – you and your rock and the world – is all unreal.”\nNow how to prove it? Johnson was not capable of proving it. His realistic argument had failed, utterly failed. No, it cannot be proved, it is always doubtful.\nFor example, you are listening to me: maybe you are just dreaming. Maybe many have fallen asleep; maybe with closed eyes you are asleep, and you are having a dream. The other cannot be proved.\nThe only indubitable phenomenon is my own existence. That cannot be doubted. Why cannot you doubt it? – because even to doubt it, it will be needed. If I say I am not, even to say this – that I am not – I have to be there. So to doubt oneself is the only impossible thing.\nAnd we don’t know who we are. The only indubitable fact has not been discovered; and we have been struggling to discover many dubitable things. And the irony: we go asking others, whose existence is dubitable, about who we are. Whatsoever they are going to say will remain only their opinion. They cannot penetrate your being; nobody can penetrate anybody else’s being.\nIn your innermost core you are ultimately celibate, alone. Nobody has ever walked into that solitude, into that shrine of your being, and nobody will ever walk there. Even lovers cannot penetrate into each other’s core. The core remains beyond. Only you, and only you, can know it.\nBut people go on asking, “Who am I?” And watch yourself – directly, indirectly, that’s what you are trying to do. How much you hanker for a compliment! How much you long that somebody will say that you are beautiful, that you are very intelligent, that “You have made my life worth living”, that “It is because of you that I have tasted something of meaning”. Just watch your mind! – this is a\nconstant preoccupation. And how worried you become when somebody says something that goes against your image, how much you feel hurt, how much you start defending, fighting, arguing. Why is there so much fear? Why is there so much longing to have good opinions from others? – because that is the only way to create a false self.\nThe false self is cheap. It is very easy: it needs only a little sociability, it needs only a little cleverness, cunningness; it needs only to be formal, mannerly, it needs etiquette. It needs a little alertness about what people want – “Be that. If you cannot, at least pretend to be that.” If they respect a knowledgeable person, then gather knowledge. Go to the university, have a few degrees so that you can write a few letters behind your name. If they respect character, then cultivate character.\nIt may be doing great harm to you; that is not the point. It may be going against your grain, it may be creating a division in your being, it may be creating a duality, a schizophrenia, but that is not the point. Respect has to be gained, because only through respect can you have a beautiful decorated self; and everybody will be supporting it.\nA sannyasin has to be very much aware of this trap. You are not to invent your self. You have to discover it. And discovery means an inward journey. Discovery means not asking the other but asking oneself “Who am I?” asking in one’s aloneness “Who am I?” letting this question penetrate deeper and deeper, like an arrow, so that it penetrates your very core – and there, one day, is the revelation.\nAnd the moment you know who you are your whole life is transformed. Your whole life becomes divine because you are gods. Your faces are different, your talents are different, your colors are different, your minds, your conditionings are different, but these are only layers around you; they don’t constitute your core. The core is your original face, uncontaminated by the society.\nAnd when you come to know your original face – the face that you had before you were born and the face that you will again have when you have died, the face that has been given to you by God – that face is the greatest experience. Knowing it, one knows all. Not knowing it, you can become very knowledgeable, but you are just hiding your ignorance.\nThe people who are very much concerned with inventing a self live a very mediocre life. They have to live a mediocre life, because they have to satisfy the mediocre crowd around themselves.\nIn India, if you want to be respected as a mahatma you will have to starve, you will have to fast. Unless you fast nobody is going to respect you as a mahatma. If you want this identity then you will have to fast. You will have to adjust to the demands of a mediocre society.\nAnd everywhere the society consists of mediocre minds – the middle class, the bourgeoisie; those who have known nothing except chasing after money and power, those who have never seen anything in depth, those who are not aware at all of the vertical dimension of life, those who go on running as fast as they can on the horizontal plane. And then one day they fall in their graves without knowing at all what they have missed, without knowing the glory and splendor of life and existence.\nSociety consists of the mediocre people, and to adjust yourself to the mediocre people is to become a mediocrity on your own. Beware of it. Watch your steps. The trap is all around and the trap is very\nalluring because it gives you the cheap satisfaction of being a certain self. And all kinds of selves are available; you can go window-shopping. If you want to become a mahatma then the mask is sold in the marketplace; you just have to know a few requirements of how to be a mahatma: what to eat, what not to eat; when to sleep, when not to sleep; how to move, with whom to move; what scriptures to read, what books to avoid. Just small things, trivia... any stupid person can manage it. In fact only stupids can manage it. If you have intelligence, you would like to live your own life on your own terms. You will not compromise. You will live like a Jesus. Even if it means crucifixion, it’s okay. Jesus died on the cross, but died with a self, died with a discovered self. That’s why he was not angry with the people who were killing him, because now he knew nobody could kill. People can kill only the self that they have given to you. They are powerful about it: they can withdraw their support and you will start collapsing.\nPeople can only kill politicians, not the mystics. People can kill the politician because the politician exists only on people’s votes, their opinions. They can withdraw their opinion and you are nobody. The throne of the politician is carried by the mediocre crowd; any moment it can change its mind, any moment somebody else can satisfy it more, can be more compromising with the mediocre people. It can change immediately.\nYou cannot destroy a religious man; that is impossible. You can kill him, but even in your killing him he remains deathless.\nThat’s the whole meaning of the resurrection. People crucified Jesus, but they could not – that is the meaning of the parable. I am not saying that it is an historical fact, that he walked again on the earth. People killed him, but people can kill only the self that they have given, they cannot kill the self that has been discovered. It is beyond their reach, it is beyond their vision. How can they kill it? They cannot even see it. The people who were crucifying Jesus were absolutely unaware of the person whom they were confronting. Who was this man that they were killing? They were killing God! They were killing one of the most significant expressions of God on the earth, but they were blissfully unaware.\nThat’s why Jesus said, “Father, forgive these people, because they don’t know what they are doing. They don’t know me, and what they are killing is their own idea of me. They cannot kill me.”\nThat’s why people like Jesus, Socrates, Buddha, are not at all worried about what you think about them. They know themselves; your thinking makes no difference. Your thinking will make a difference to you, but it makes no difference to them. They go on living on their own; they live an authentic life.\nMy sannyasins have to remember it: don’t hanker for a self from the outside. It is a wastage of time, and the people can withdraw it at any moment. And their minds are not very stable, they constantly change. Their minds are not very integrated, they cannot retain any state. They don’t know of any continuity in their being; they are fragments. One day they will support and praise you, another day they will pull you down and condemn you.\nThis is what has been happening down the ages, the whole history is full of it. One day they call you great, another they start condemning you. In fact, whomsoever they call great they are bound to condemn. There is a rationale behind it: whomsoever the mediocre person calls great, he starts\nfeeling inferior in comparison to the person he has made great. Nobody likes to feel inferior. Then sooner or later he takes revenge so that he can pull you down and can show you that you are “made of mud as I am made of mud”. First they put you on great pedestals, only to pull you down. They enjoy the game very much.\nBeware of it! Don’t depend on what others say. It is utterly irrelevant. All that matters in the ultimate sense is what you know about yourself.\nI am reminded of an incident. I had just passed my Master’s degree in the university and I was in search of a service, of a job. I approached the education minister, I talked to him. He said, “It will be possible, there is a vacancy, but you will have to produce two character certificates.” I said, “From whom?” He said, “You can ask your vice-chancellor to give you a character certificate. You can ask the chancellor, the proctor, or there are so many famous professors in your university; you can ask anybody.”\nI said, “But that won’t do – because if the vice-chancellor of my university wants a character certificate from me, I will not give it to him. How can I ask a character certificate from a man to whom I cannot give a character certificate? He is one of the most corrupted politicians of the country. He has become the vice-chancellor not because he has any abilities to be a vice-chancellor, but just because he is a politician. I will not ask any character certificate from him. I cannot ask my professor either because I know him intimately. In fact he is afraid of me. I know all the ins and outs of his life. He is a very cowardly man, ready to bow down to any person who has authority and power. I have seen him flattering stupid politicians because he is also hoping to become the vice-chancellor of the university some day and the only way is to go on flattering the politicians, the powerful people. No, I will not ask for a character certificate from him.\n“All that I can do is: I am here. You look into my eyes, you hold my hand. I will look into your eyes and you look into my eyes; I will know your character, you will know my character – and it is finished.”\nHe became a little worried. He said, “What do you mean?”\nI said, “This is my hand! You give your hand to me and look into my eyes!” and he started looking here and there. It is very difficult for cunning people to look into anybody’s eyes directly. They are so full of guilt. I could see perspiration coming over his head. I said, “Why are you getting so much in a panic? Just look into my eyes and see! I am here, feel me. If you want me I can be here as many days as you want, sitting in this room. I will see your character, you will see my character.”\nHe signed the papers. He said, “You go! You are appointed! And never come again! You are the only person who has frightened me.”\nNever depend on others’ opinions. Who are they? How can they give a character certificate?\nThis whole parable is beautiful. It is a hit on human stupidity. Remember, if you are asking for a self to be invented with the help of others, you will remain mediocre. You will never be the flowering of intelligence.\nIntelligence comes only when you discover yourself. Intelligence is the shadow of that discovery; the great exhilaration that happens when you have stumbled upon yourself face to face, when you have encountered yourself, when you know who you are. Suddenly you are rooted in existence, suddenly you are beyond time. Even death cannot kill you and fire cannot burn you. You are eternal.\nIn that eternity all fear disappears. And when there is no fear there is freedom. In that beautiful experience of oneself all hankering for possessions disappears, because you possess the very kingdom of God. Now nothing is of worth. In that experience all doubts dissolve. You have come to an absolute rock, and only on this rock can the temple of religion be built. This rock is eternal. Otherwise whatsoever you are doing is just making sandcastles on the seashore; just a strong gust of wind and all those castles will disappear.\nAll that you are doing is writing your name on the sand. Time is just sand and nothing else. Time cannot give you any taste of the eternal, and without that taste one remains frightened of death. The invented self is always afraid, continuously afraid. It lives in fear, it lives in paranoia, it lives in neurosis. The discovered self knows nothing of the abnormal, perverted, neurotic mind. It becomes simple, it becomes ordinary, but that ordinariness is luminous.\nKierkegaard calls this attitude of constantly remaining preoccupied with inventing a self “philistinism”. This means a mediocre existence, living in the security of the womb, a superficial satisfaction with everything as it is. It means to live life on the surface and to never explore its deeper, psychic dimensions. It is the refusal to be born, the refusal to grow. It means being close-minded to passion, risk and broader perspectives. It is a state of shut-upness.\nPeople are living as if they are closed from everywhere. Their existence is a kind of shut-upness. Their existence is windowless: the sun never penetrates into their beings, nor the wind, nor the rain. They simply live closed into themselves. They are afraid of coming into the open, because if they come into the open people may change their ideas about them. When they want to cry they laugh, because what will people think? Crying is sissy! They will condemn. They keep a very strong face, the face of steel, and behind this is a child who wants to cry, who wants to play around, who wants to run in the garden after the butterflies, who wants to collect wildflowers. But that they never allow: they remain stiff. They go on repressing the child, and that child is far more valuable than what you are pretending to be because the child is real, authentic. And the people who live in this kind of shut-upness cannot grow, because growth means being in constant communion with existence, being nude with existence, hiding nothing, keeping no secret, remaining available and vulnerable, remaining open to all kinds of risks and dangers. Only then does growth happen.\nYou see people all over the world growing old, but without growing up. Even in their old age they remain childish deep down, because they never allowed their own real self to grow. They have been piling upon the false self, decorating, bringing more ornaments for the false self, creating new props so it doesn’t collapse; but this false self cannot grow. Remember one thing: no false thing can ever grow, it remains stuck. Can you think of a plastic flower growing? The real rose grows, the plastic rose remains as it is. It is dead, how can it grow?\nThe self that is given to you by others is a dead entity; it cannot grow, it cannot flow. It is a frozen thing! And with that frozen thing you will be imprisoned.\nWhen I look at people, watch their faces and their beings, I am constantly in deep pain seeing them. Great compassion arises. They could have been beautiful beings but they have remained retarded. They could have been glowing beings but there is no glow, there is no fire. And all that they think they are doing, and all that they think that they are living, is just so futile. It is futile because it does not bring growth. The most important thing in life is growth. Religion is the science of growth. And the beginning of the growth is changing the gestalt from the false self to the real self. The real is already given, it is a God-given gift; the false has to be gathered from people, people who don’t know themselves. How can they give you any sense of reality? Beware of it!\nThe beginning of the inner journey has to start with the question “Who am I?” And it has to become more and more a quest than a question. The question means a superficial curiosity, the quest means a passionate love-affair.\nIt will be good to understand this word “question” and the symbol of the question-mark. The symbol of the question-mark is very significant. You may be surprised to know that it comes from the first incident in human history: the meeting of the serpent with Eve near the Tree of Knowledge. The serpent created the first question in Eve’s mind: to eat the fruit or not? The question-mark is the snake standing on its tail. It represents the snake on its tail.\nHistory begins with a question-mark, the whole of human history; the serpent started it. He has remained in the symbol, the question-mark, standing on his tail. He must have stood on his tail and must have talked to Eve, must have seduced her into eating the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge.\nIn another sense, properly understood, it is also the sign of how knowledge has come into being. All knowledge starts with questions. To ask is the beginning of any inquiry. But if the question remains only a question, then you will remain Adam and you will never become a Christ. Hence the other symbol has also to be understood: that symbol is the serpent eating its own tail.\nThat symbol has been used by many ancient esoteric schools. It was used by Rosicrucians, and many gnostics have used the symbol of a snake eating its own tail. Then the snake becomes a circle. When the snake starts eating its own tail, it is a quest. Why is it a quest? When a question remains just a question its interest is in an answer, verbal, intellectual, but no verbal, intellectual answer can satisfy it. New questions will arise out of the answer.\nThis has been the path of philosophy. Philosophy is synonymous with the question-mark, the serpent standing on its tail.\nThen what is the history of religion? Just the opposite – the question eating itself – the snake eating its own tail. In the religious quest, questions disappear, thirst remains. There comes a moment when nothing is in your mind, not even the question. The question has eaten itself up.\nThat’s what happens in a Zen koan: an absurd question. And why absurd? – for this particular reason: if it is not absurd then the mind will supply an answer. And if the mind supplies an answer, out of that answer ten more questions will arise. And then it will be a regress ad infinitum; there will be no end to it. Hence an absurd question is given to the meditator so that mind cannot supply any answer. If no answer is supplied how long can you go on asking the question, how long? – one year, two years, three years, four, five, six... one gets tired. A moment comes when one is so exhausted\nwith the question and the futility of it all, and one knows there is no answer to it. One day, out of sheer exhaustion, the question slips out of your consciousness. You are left alone, a pure mirror reflecting nothing.\nThe question has eaten itself; that is koan. The snake has started eating its own tail: now the circle is complete, the perfect circle. The perfect circle has been the symbol of wisdom. The question is the beginning of knowledge, the perfect circle is the symbol of wisdom.\nAdam is a question-mark, Jesus is a full circle – so is Buddha, so am I, so can you be. You come to me as a question-mark, but please don’t go from here as a question-mark. And don’t go from here becoming a little more knowledgeable, gathering a few answers – because those answers will soon become questions. Go from here as a perfect circle – the snake eating its own tail, and then there will be no more questions.\nAnd the state of the mind which does not question is the state of mind which is the answer. Not that any answer comes to you; it itself is the answer – the silence, the stillness, the utterly contentless consciousness, is the answer. It is samadhi. And only in samadhi do you know who you are.\nThis small parable.…\nONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A FOX WHO MET A YOUNG RABBIT IN THE WOODS. THE RABBIT SAID, “WHAT ARE YOU?”\nThe rabbit must have been a philosopher.\nTHE FOX SAID, “I AM A FOX, AND I COULD EAT YOU IF I WANTED TO.” “HOW CAN YOU PROVE THAT YOU ARE A FOX?”\nThat’s what the philosophic mind always asks: “How can you prove that you are a fox?”\nPeople come to me and they ask, “How can you prove that you are Bhagwan?” There is no need to prove it. I am. And I am very much surprised, because you also are the same, but completely unaware. Maybe my declaring that I am God disturbs your sleep. You become angry; you start thinking, “If this man is God, then why am I not?” You start feeling inferior.\nIn fact, that is not the purpose of my declaration. My declaration includes you! When I am saying I am God, I am saying every human being is God – and not only every human being, every being is God. To be is to be God; there is no other way. God is trees in the trees and birds in the birds and mountains in the mountains, man in man, woman in woman. God has all these manifestations. All these beautiful waves arise in His ocean.\nWhen I declare that I am the ocean, other waves become disturbed. They think that I am claiming some superiority, that I am saying that you are only waves and I am an ocean. I am not saying that. By declaring that I am the ocean I have declared that you are also the ocean.\nBut if you don’t want to recognize it, it is your freedom not to see the truth. You can keep your eyes closed, you can remain blindfolded; that is your decision. If you have chosen not to be a God you\ncan go on pretending not to be a God – but I tell you it is only a pretension. God is your reality, and whatsoever else you are pretending is only just a belief. And even when you pretend that you are this and that and not God, then too you remain God deep down. There is no way of being anything else.\nEven the wave that says, “I don’t believe in the ocean, and CERTAINLY I am not the ocean; I can see my limitations: one day I arise, another day I am gone. How can I be the eternal ocean? I am not!” still, even while she is declaring it, she is the ocean. She is part of the ocean, the ocean is underneath, but she has not looked into her own depths.\nEvery day newspapers carry one criticism about me: that I am a self-appointed God. That means a committee is needed to appoint. Maybe a government has to issue certificates saying who is God and who is not God, or maybe a university has to issue certificates. The people who criticize me as a self-appointed God have taken it for granted that God should be appointed by others. Who are these others, and what right have they, and who has appointed them? Now it will be a regress, ad nauseam.\nBuddha declared himself, Krishna declared himself, Jesus declared himself; they were all self- appointed Gods. But there is no other way. When I have come to know, when I have come to see who I am, what can I do? I have simply to state the fact. It is a bare, naked truth – and it is not only my truth.\nIf I were declaring that I am God and you are not, then it would be just an ego-trip. But my declaration includes you, includes the whole existence. It has nothing to do with me as such; in fact I am no more there, and only God is. I have dropped the self that you are carrying; the self that is created by others, I have dropped. And in dropping that, the real self is discovered.\nTHE RABBIT ASKED, “HOW CAN YOU PROVE THAT YOU ARE A FOX?” THE FOX DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO SAY, BECAUSE IN THE PAST RABBITS HAD ALWAYS RUN FROM HIM WITHOUT SUCH INQUIRIES.\nTHEN THE RABBIT SAID, “LF YOU CAN SHOW ME WRITTEN PROOF THAT YOU ARE A FOX, I WILL BELIEVE YOU.”\nThat is part of the human mind: anything written and people believe it. The written or the printed word has a hypnotic power over people. I say something: if it goes against your scripture you come immediately to me to say that it is not written in the Bible – as if just by writing something it becomes true. If it is not written in the Bible, so what? So it is not written in the Bible! Improve upon the Bible – write it. At least you can write it in your own copy.\nBut people believe the written word very much; it is almost hypnotic. That’s why you can go on believing even stupid newspapers, because a printed thing, a written thing? – then it must be true. All kinds of falsities and lies go on being circulated.\nJust the other day I was reading one German newspaper. It says I have two wives, one Indian, one Western. Looks very relevant... because that’s why I say “the meeting of the East and the West”! And the more amazing thing is that the picture that he has chosen to show of my two wives – one of\nthem is Shiva! Shiva has long hairs; he is standing with his back towards the camera, so he is my Indian wife! It is really nice of these people.…\nThe other newspaper I was reading has written that I fly in a helicopter. I liked it. I never leave my room... and I fly in helicopters? True, I fly, but I fly without helicopters! And even a greater discovery is there – that I eat only eggs, meat, lobsters, and nothing else!\nNow millions of people in Germany will believe it: a written thing is a written thing after all.\nAnother newspaper has a report that the reporter came to the ashram early in the morning, at five- thirty. He knocked on the door. A naked, utterly beautiful woman opened the door, hugged him, welcomed him, “Come in,” plucked a fruit from this tree – looked like an apple – gave the fruit to the reporter, and told the reporter, “Eat it. It rejuvenates sexual energy.”\nAnd you will be surprised – letters have started arriving. One man writes from Austria: “I am Sixty and I have a young wife. Please, Osho, be kind to me. I can come to India. I have heard that in India things like that happen. Can you give me that fruit?”\nIt is believed, and all kinds of rubbish, all kinds of falsities and lies go on being written. And many believe.\nSatynanda wrote from Germany – now he has come – he wrote from Germany that “So many lies are being printed in German newspapers. In Germany it is almost a Rajneesh wave.” He wrote a letter to make us aware that many kinds of sexual maniacs and perverts will reach, “So be alert, because many are preparing.” If such fruits are there, and such a commune exists where all is permitted, where all people live in nudity – all you people are sitting nude, remember! – where clothes are not allowed... These reports are being published, and many will believe. That’s how people believe.\nBut I am happy. Let-them come, for ANY reason. Then we will see! I have even written to this old man, “You come! Fruit or no fruit, but you come I” Who knows? Doing Dynamic, Kundalini, he may go beyond sex. That is a possibility.\nTHE RABBIT SAID, “IF YOU CAN SHOW ME WRITTEN PROOF THAT YOU ARE A FOX, I WILL BELIEVE YOU.”\nPeople believe only when something is written. Why do you believe in the Vedas? Why do you believe in the Bible? Why do you believe in the Geeta? It is a written document, ancient, of great prestige. What else is there?just a great tradition supporting it.\nIf there had been no written record of Jesus, you would have forgotten all about Jesus. There have been many teachers and Masters of the capacity of Jesus, of the same calibre, but you don’t even know their names.\nIn India, when Buddha existed and Mahavira was alive, there were many more teachers, at least six of the same calibre, of the same status, but you will not even know their names.\nOne of them was Prakuta Katyiaena, a rare gem. But he insisted that his words should not be written so that no tradition arise after him. Certainly his words were not written; no tradition has arisen, but people have completely forgotten even his name.\nThere was another great teacher, Buddha’s contemporary, Purnakashyapa, but because no scriptures exist – they were written, but destroyed by the organized religion in India – nobody, knows anything about him.\nPeople believe in the written word. People believe too much in their eyes. One should believe only in one’s own experience. Nothing else should become a substitute, otherwise you start going false.\nSO THE FOX TROTTED OFF TO THE LION, WHO GAVE HIM A CERTIFICATE THAT HE WAS A FOX.\nWHEN HE GOT BACK TO WHERE THE RABBIT WAS WAITING, THE FOX STARTED TO READ OUT THE DOCUMENT. IT SO PLEASED HIM THAT HE DWELT OVER THE PARAGRAPHS WITH LINGERING DELIGHT.…\nYou have also done it many times. If somebody writes a beautiful letter to you, you read it again and again and again. Why “with great lingering delight”? Somebody has praised you; it gives you a good sense of self. People are ready to die to be praised. People are ready to do anything.\nI have heard about a politician. There was a great ceremony, his birthday was celebrated. Hundreds of rose garlands were presented to him, but his secretary was a little puzzled because he was not looking very happy.\nWhen the ceremony was finished the secretary asked, “You look a little sad.” He said, “Yes. Only a hundred garlands? And I had paid for two hundred.” You have to pay for your own garlands.\nPeople go on paying in subtle ways so that they can be praised. And there exists a mutual arrangement in the world “You scratch my back, I will scratch yours,” and both enjoy.\nWHEN HE GOT BACK TO WHERE THE RABBIT WAS WAITING, THE FOX STARTED TO READ OUT THE DOCUMENT. IT SO PLEASED HIM THAT HE DWELT OVER THE PARAGRAPHS WITH LINGERING DELIGHT. MEANWHILE, GETTING THE GIST OF THE MESSAGE FROM THE FIRST FEW LINES, THE RABBIT RAN DOWN A BURROW AND WAS NEVER SEEN AGAIN.\nTHE FOX WENT BACK TO THE LION’S DEN, WHERE HE SAW A DEER TALKING TO THE LION. THE DEER WAS SAYING, “I WANT TO SEE WRITTEN PROOF THAT YOU ARE A LION.”\nTHE LION SAID, “WHEN I AM NOT HUNGRY, I DON’T NEED TO BOTHER. WHEN I AM HUNGRY, YOU DON’T NEED ANYTHING IN WRITING.”\nYou will know.…\nThis is the right approach, the lion’s approach: “Who cares whether you believe in me or not?”\nIf somebody comes to me: “What is the proof that you are God?” who bothers? I am not here to collect stupid followers. My approach is the lion’s approach. He said, “When I am not hungry, I don’t need to bother. When I am hungry, you don’t need anything in writing.”\nAnd that’s my approach too. If just a curious person comes to me, I need not bother. I tell him, “Get lost.” If a disciple reaches to me there is no need for any proof. In his very disciplehood he has got the proof.\nTHE FOX SAID TO THE LION, ” WHY DIDN’T YOU TELL ME TO DO THAT WHEN I ASKED FOR A CERTIFICATE FOR THE RABBIT?”\n“MY DEAR FRIEND,”SAID THE LION,’ YOU SHOULD HAVE SAID THAT IT WAS REQUESTED BY A RABBIT. I THOUGHT IT MUST BE FOR A STUPID HUMAN BEING,FROM WHOM SOME OF THESE IDIOTIC ANIMALS HAVE LEARNED THIS PASTIME. ”\nExcept man, who is worried about inventing a self? Except man, nobody is neurotic on the earth. Except man, nobody has gone astray so far away from himself that he needs certificates to prove his validity, that he needs certificates to prove his existence, that he needs certificates to prove his character, intelligence.\nEither you have intelligence or you don’t have. No certificate is needed; your life will be its own proof. Your joy will be enough of a certificate, your bliss will show, will prove it. Nothing else is needed.\nThe moment you come to me I welcome you, I invite you to come closer and closer to me so that sooner or later you start drinking of the nectar that has happened to me, that is flowing in me. That will be the proof; nothing else is needed.\nMahavira had no proof, Bahaudin had no proof, Jesus had no proof, Buddha had no proof. They were proofs themselves. Those who have eyes will be able to see and those who have ears will be able to hear and those who have hearts will be able to feel. But the human mind has fallen into great stupidity. Humanity is living by words. Words have become too important. The word “fire” has become more important than fire itself. The word “God” has become more important than God itself. And remember, the word “God” is not God and the word “love” is not love.\nDon’t be deceived by words, beware of words. You can be lost in the jungle of words and you will be going farther and farther away from truth.\nTruth is a wordless experience. Truth happens only when there is no thought in you, when all words have disappeared and all the dust is gone from the mirror, when the mirror is simply mirroring – and mirroring nothing. No reflection is made, no wave arises in the lake of your consciousness. Then all is reflected, then you know what is – not only that you know who you are, you know what this whole existence is. Knowing oneself, one knows the whole.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"7996","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_secret/part11/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_secret/>The Secret</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">11 The Lion And The Fox</h1><div class=post-meta>38 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;7996 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Secret/part11.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part10>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

REQUESTED BY A RABBIT. I THOUGHT THAT IT MUST BE FOR A STUPID HUMAN
BEING, FROM WHOM SOME OF THESE IDIOTIC ANIMALS HAVE LEARNED THIS
PASTIME.”</p><p><br></p><p>MAN IS CONTINUOUSLY PREOCCUPIED WITH INVENTING A SELF FOR HIMSELF,
but the</p><p>invented self can never be the real self. There is no possibility
that the invented will ever be the real. The real self has to be
discovered, not invented.</p><p><br></p><p>The invented self becomes our ego. The real self is not in any way
the ego. The real self is not a self at all; it is utter emptiness, and
the silence of emptiness, and the joy of emptiness.</p><p><br></p><p>If you want to invent a self you will have to ask others; that’s the
only way to invent it – to gather opinions of what people think about
you. That’s what we go on doing our whole lives. That’s why we are so
afraid of people’s disrespect. That becomes our bondage. We want to be
respectable, because if we are respectable then people’s opinion about
us is beautiful. They praise us and we can have a better self. If we are
not respectable people condemn; and then you will not ever have a
beautiful self, you will have an ugly self. Your self consists only of
the opinion s of others; it is a patchwork. A has said something, and B
has said something else, and C something else, and so on, so forth. You
collect all these things, these paper cuttings. Then you make an image
out of them – you fix them together, you glue them together.</p><p><br></p><p>From the very beginning the child starts collecting this rubbish. The
mother says something, the father, the brother, the neighbors: if it is
gratifying he starts feeling proud, if it is not gratifying he starts
feeling depressed. To avoid depression he goes on flattering everybody
that he meets. The flattery is nothing but an arrangement: “I will
flatter you so that you can give me a good certificate. I will flatter
you more if you are willing to give me an even better certificate.” But
all these certificates are just from the outside, and nobody knows you,
who you are – not even you yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>So what others say about you is almost irrelevant to your reality.
They only know your appearance, and appearances can be very false. The
person who looks very gentle on the outside may be very egoistic inside.
That gentleness may be just a camouflage, a protection, an armor. The
man who looks very clever on the outside may be just the opposite – he
may be utterly stupid. The stupid person has to pretend cleverness; it
hurts to know, “I am stupid.” The man who goes on bragging about his
knowledge is bound to be ignorant. But who wants to be known as an
ignorant person? – he collects some information and goes on broadcasting
that information to people. Slowly, slowly he gathers a reputation that
he knows, but this knowledge is false, this reputation is false. These
certificates are given to you by people who don’t know you, who can’t
know you. There is no way for anybody else to know you except yourself.
And whatsoever they are saying, they are saying only so that you can
give them a good certificate. So it is a mutual conspiracy; we are
deceiving each other. Somebody says, “You are beautiful,” and of course
you have to return the compliment. Somebody says, “You are so
intelligent,” and you have to return the compliment: “You must be a very
intelligent person, otherwise you would not have known about my
intelligence. You must be a man of great understanding – you are the
first man who has understood me.”</p><p>This constant preoccupation with inventing one’s own self has to be
understood. Why is it there at all? It is there because you are feeling
a constant gnawing emptiness within your heart. You don’t know who you
are, and it is very difficult to live without knowing who you are.
Unless you know who you are whatsoever you do is going to be a failure,
a frustration.</p><p><br></p><p>You can succeed in being fulfilled only if you know who you are. Then
you will choose your life in such a way that it becomes a fulfillment to
your real needs. Otherwise, not knowing yourself, whatsoever you do
remains accidental. Maybe once in a while your arrow may reach the
target, but that is accidental and it will happen only once in a while.
You are shooting in darkness, without knowing who you are, without
knowing where the target is. It is almost impossible that sometimes it
may hit the target; ninety-nine percent is the possibility that you will
remain empty and you will die empty. Your life will be a tragedy. That’s
why people carry such a tragic sense on their faces, in their eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>Watch people, watch yourself, and you will see – people are living a
very tragic existence. Their whole past has gone in vain and they know
that today is also slipping out of their hands; and deep down the
suspicion that whatsoever they have been doing in the past they are
going to do in the future too. So it is all a meaningless journey, “a
tale told by an idiot, full of fury and noise, signifying nothing”.</p><p><br></p><p>And unless significance is felt, how can you be joyous? Unless your
life throbs with significance how can it become a song? Only a
significant life becomes a song. When you start feeling there is
meaning, when you start feeling that you are fulfilling something very
essential to existence – that you are needed, that you are part of this
cosmic drama, this cosmic play, that without you something will be
missing, that without you the drama will not be the same at all – then
great respect arises towards oneself; and in that very respect gratitude
towards existence, prayer, thankfulness.</p><p><br></p><p>But the most fundamental thing is to know oneself: Who am I. And to
know oneself means to discover – because you are already there, you are
not to be invented. Whatsoever you invent will be a fiction, will not be
truth. And how can you delude yourself? Maybe for one day you can delude
yourself, for two days, but for how long? Delusions wear out. They
cannot remain against reality forever. Reality goes on asserting.</p><p><br></p><p>And there are only two kinds of people in the world: the majority
consists of those who invent the self, and a very small minority of
those who discover the self. And the difference is vast, the difference
is tremendous: they are two worlds apart. A Buddha, a Jesus, a Bahaudin,
a Rumi, a Mansur – they discover.</p><p><br></p><p>What do I mean by discovery? The first thing to remember is that you
already have the self. You are. That needs no proof. That is indubitably
there, you cannot even doubt it.</p><p><br></p><p>The great European philosopher, Descartes, says, “The only
indubitable fact about life is that I am.” Only this cannot be doubted;
everything else can be doubted. You can doubt the world; it may not be,
it may be just a dream, as Hindus say – that it is maya, an illusion, a
dream in God’s mind. Maybe, possibly; it cannot be denied, there is no
way to deny it. That’s exactly what Berkeley says – that the world is
not a real world, it is a fantasy, a thought, not a thing. Nobody has
ever been able to refute Shankara or Berkeley. It cannot be refuted. How
to refute it?</p><p>Berkeley was walking with Doctor Johnson. Doctor Johnson was a
realist. He was very offended by the Berkelinian idea that the world is
only a thought, not a thing; that it is just a fiction, a mind
projection – there are no trees outside, there are no people outside;
only I am. Johnson, being a realist, was getting very angry, more so
because he could not find how to refute this man logically, how to prove
that the tree outside there was really there.…</p><p><br></p><p>How to prove it? – because in the dream also we see trees, and they
look almost the same as these trees. And in the dream also we think that
they are there; only in the morning when we wake up do we find that they
were not there. Who knows? – when death comes and we wake up finally, we
may come to know that all those trees, and the people, and the world,
and the earth, and the moon, and the sun, were all just a long, long
dream. How to prove it?</p><p><br></p><p>... He took a rock from the road and hit Berkeley’s feet with the
rock. Blood started oozing and Berkeley was in great pain and very angry
too. He said, “What kind of behavior is this? What wrong have I done to
you? Why have you hit me with the rock? I don’t see the point.”</p><p><br></p><p>Johnson laughed and he said, “This is to refute your so-called
idealism. Now if the rock is unreal, why are you crying? Why are there
tears in your eyes? How can I hit with an unreal rock?”</p><p><br></p><p>Berkeley started laughing. He said, “But my pain is unreal too, and
my tears are unreal too. Only I am real. Who knows that the tears are
flowing, that the blood is oozing, that the feet are hurting like hell?
Only I who knows, the witness, is real. Everything else, Doctor Johnson
– you and your rock and the world – is all unreal.”</p><p><br></p><p>Now how to prove it? Johnson was not capable of proving it. His
realistic argument had failed, utterly failed. No, it cannot be proved,
it is always doubtful.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, you are listening to me: maybe you are just dreaming.
Maybe many have fallen asleep; maybe with closed eyes you are asleep,
and you are having a dream. The other cannot be proved.</p><p><br></p><p>The only indubitable phenomenon is my own existence. That cannot be
doubted. Why cannot you doubt it? – because even to doubt it, it will be
needed. If I say I am not, even to say this – that I am not – I have to
be there. So to doubt oneself is the only impossible thing.</p><p><br></p><p>And we don’t know who we are. The only indubitable fact has not been
discovered; and we have been struggling to discover many dubitable
things. And the irony: we go asking others, whose existence is
dubitable, about who we are. Whatsoever they are going to say will
remain only their opinion. They cannot penetrate your being; nobody can
penetrate anybody else’s being.</p><p><br></p><p>In your innermost core you are ultimately celibate, alone. Nobody has
ever walked into that solitude, into that shrine of your being, and
nobody will ever walk there. Even lovers cannot penetrate into each
other’s core. The core remains beyond. Only you, and only you, can know
it.</p><p><br></p><p>But people go on asking, “Who am I?” And watch yourself – directly,
indirectly, that’s what you are trying to do. How much you hanker for a
compliment! How much you long that somebody will say that you are
beautiful, that you are very intelligent, that “You have made my life
worth living”, that “It is because of you that I have tasted something
of meaning”. Just watch your mind! – this is a</p><p>constant preoccupation. And how worried you become when somebody says
something that goes against your image, how much you feel hurt, how much
you start defending, fighting, arguing. Why is there so much fear? Why
is there so much longing to have good opinions from others? – because
that is the only way to create a false self.</p><p><br></p><p>The false self is cheap. It is very easy: it needs only a little
sociability, it needs only a little cleverness, cunningness; it needs
only to be formal, mannerly, it needs etiquette. It needs a little
alertness about what people want – “Be that. If you cannot, at least
pretend to be that.” If they respect a knowledgeable person, then gather
knowledge. Go to the university, have a few degrees so that you can
write a few letters behind your name. If they respect character, then
cultivate character.</p><p><br></p><p>It may be doing great harm to you; that is not the point. It may be
going against your grain, it may be creating a division in your being,
it may be creating a duality, a schizophrenia, but that is not the
point. Respect has to be gained, because only through respect can you
have a beautiful decorated self; and everybody will be supporting
it.</p><p><br></p><p>A sannyasin has to be very much aware of this trap. You are not to
invent your self. You have to discover it. And discovery means an inward
journey. Discovery means not asking the other but asking oneself “Who am
I?” asking in one’s aloneness “Who am I?” letting this question
penetrate deeper and deeper, like an arrow, so that it penetrates your
very core – and there, one day, is the revelation.</p><p><br></p><p>And the moment you know who you are your whole life is transformed.
Your whole life becomes divine because you are gods. Your faces are
different, your talents are different, your colors are different, your
minds, your conditionings are different, but these are only layers
around you; they don’t constitute your core. The core is your original
face, uncontaminated by the society.</p><p><br></p><p>And when you come to know your original face – the face that you had
before you were born and the face that you will again have when you have
died, the face that has been given to you by God – that face is the
greatest experience. Knowing it, one knows all. Not knowing it, you can
become very knowledgeable, but you are just hiding your ignorance.</p><p><br></p><p>The people who are very much concerned with inventing a self live a
very mediocre life. They have to live a mediocre life, because they have
to satisfy the mediocre crowd around themselves.</p><p><br></p><p>In India, if you want to be respected as a mahatma you will have to
starve, you will have to fast. Unless you fast nobody is going to
respect you as a mahatma. If you want this identity then you will have
to fast. You will have to adjust to the demands of a mediocre
society.</p><p><br></p><p>And everywhere the society consists of mediocre minds – the middle
class, the bourgeoisie; those who have known nothing except chasing
after money and power, those who have never seen anything in depth,
those who are not aware at all of the vertical dimension of life, those
who go on running as fast as they can on the horizontal plane. And then
one day they fall in their graves without knowing at all what they have
missed, without knowing the glory and splendor of life and
existence.</p><p><br></p><p>Society consists of the mediocre people, and to adjust yourself to
the mediocre people is to become a mediocrity on your own. Beware of it.
Watch your steps. The trap is all around and the trap is very</p><p>alluring because it gives you the cheap satisfaction of being a
certain self. And all kinds of selves are available; you can go
window-shopping. If you want to become a mahatma then the mask is sold
in the marketplace; you just have to know a few requirements of how to
be a mahatma: what to eat, what not to eat; when to sleep, when not to
sleep; how to move, with whom to move; what scriptures to read, what
books to avoid. Just small things, trivia... any stupid person can
manage it. In fact only stupids can manage it. If you have intelligence,
you would like to live your own life on your own terms. You will not
compromise. You will live like a Jesus. Even if it means crucifixion,
it’s okay. Jesus died on the cross, but died with a self, died with a
discovered self. That’s why he was not angry with the people who were
killing him, because now he knew nobody could kill. People can kill only
the self that they have given to you. They are powerful about it: they
can withdraw their support and you will start collapsing.</p><p><br></p><p>People can only kill politicians, not the mystics. People can kill
the politician because the politician exists only on people’s votes,
their opinions. They can withdraw their opinion and you are nobody. The
throne of the politician is carried by the mediocre crowd; any moment it
can change its mind, any moment somebody else can satisfy it more, can
be more compromising with the mediocre people. It can change
immediately.</p><p><br></p><p>You cannot destroy a religious man; that is impossible. You can kill
him, but even in your killing him he remains deathless.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s the whole meaning of the resurrection. People crucified Jesus,
but they could not – that is the meaning of the parable. I am not saying
that it is an historical fact, that he walked again on the earth. People
killed him, but people can kill only the self that they have given, they
cannot kill the self that has been discovered. It is beyond their reach,
it is beyond their vision. How can they kill it? They cannot even see
it. The people who were crucifying Jesus were absolutely unaware of the
person whom they were confronting. Who was this man that they were
killing? They were killing God! They were killing one of the most
significant expressions of God on the earth, but they were blissfully
unaware.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why Jesus said, “Father, forgive these people, because they
don’t know what they are doing. They don’t know me, and what they are
killing is their own idea of me. They cannot kill me.”</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why people like Jesus, Socrates, Buddha, are not at all
worried about what you think about them. They know themselves; your
thinking makes no difference. Your thinking will make a difference to
you, but it makes no difference to them. They go on living on their own;
they live an authentic life.</p><p><br></p><p>My sannyasins have to remember it: don’t hanker for a self from the
outside. It is a wastage of time, and the people can withdraw it at any
moment. And their minds are not very stable, they constantly change.
Their minds are not very integrated, they cannot retain any state. They
don’t know of any continuity in their being; they are fragments. One day
they will support and praise you, another day they will pull you down
and condemn you.</p><p><br></p><p>This is what has been happening down the ages, the whole history is
full of it. One day they call you great, another they start condemning
you. In fact, whomsoever they call great they are bound to condemn.
There is a rationale behind it: whomsoever the mediocre person calls
great, he starts</p><p>feeling inferior in comparison to the person he has made great.
Nobody likes to feel inferior. Then sooner or later he takes revenge so
that he can pull you down and can show you that you are “made of mud as
I am made of mud”. First they put you on great pedestals, only to pull
you down. They enjoy the game very much.</p><p><br></p><p>Beware of it! Don’t depend on what others say. It is utterly
irrelevant. All that matters in the ultimate sense is what you know
about yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>I am reminded of an incident. I had just passed my Master’s degree in
the university and I was in search of a service, of a job. I approached
the education minister, I talked to him. He said, “It will be possible,
there is a vacancy, but you will have to produce two character
certificates.” I said, “From whom?” He said, “You can ask your
vice-chancellor to give you a character certificate. You can ask the
chancellor, the proctor, or there are so many famous professors in your
university; you can ask anybody.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “But that won’t do – because if the vice-chancellor of my
university wants a character certificate from me, I will not give it to
him. How can I ask a character certificate from a man to whom I cannot
give a character certificate? He is one of the most corrupted
politicians of the country. He has become the vice-chancellor not
because he has any abilities to be a vice-chancellor, but just because
he is a politician. I will not ask any character certificate from him. I
cannot ask my professor either because I know him intimately. In fact he
is afraid of me. I know all the ins and outs of his life. He is a very
cowardly man, ready to bow down to any person who has authority and
power. I have seen him flattering stupid politicians because he is also
hoping to become the vice-chancellor of the university some day and the
only way is to go on flattering the politicians, the powerful people.
No, I will not ask for a character certificate from him.</p><p><br></p><p>“All that I can do is: I am here. You look into my eyes, you hold my
hand. I will look into your eyes and you look into my eyes; I will know
your character, you will know my character – and it is finished.”</p><p><br></p><p>He became a little worried. He said, “What do you mean?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “This is my hand! You give your hand to me and look into my
eyes!” and he started looking here and there. It is very difficult for
cunning people to look into anybody’s eyes directly. They are so full of
guilt. I could see perspiration coming over his head. I said, “Why are
you getting so much in a panic? Just look into my eyes and see! I am
here, feel me. If you want me I can be here as many days as you want,
sitting in this room. I will see your character, you will see my
character.”</p><p><br></p><p>He signed the papers. He said, “You go! You are appointed! And never
come again! You are the only person who has frightened me.”</p><p><br></p><p>Never depend on others’ opinions. Who are they? How can they give a
character certificate?</p><p><br></p><p>This whole parable is beautiful. It is a hit on human stupidity.
Remember, if you are asking for a self to be invented with the help of
others, you will remain mediocre. You will never be the flowering of
intelligence.</p><p>Intelligence comes only when you discover yourself. Intelligence is
the shadow of that discovery; the great exhilaration that happens when
you have stumbled upon yourself face to face, when you have encountered
yourself, when you know who you are. Suddenly you are rooted in
existence, suddenly you are beyond time. Even death cannot kill you and
fire cannot burn you. You are eternal.</p><p><br></p><p>In that eternity all fear disappears. And when there is no fear there
is freedom. In that beautiful experience of oneself all hankering for
possessions disappears, because you possess the very kingdom of God. Now
nothing is of worth. In that experience all doubts dissolve. You have
come to an absolute rock, and only on this rock can the temple of
religion be built. This rock is eternal. Otherwise whatsoever you are
doing is just making sandcastles on the seashore; just a strong gust of
wind and all those castles will disappear.</p><p><br></p><p>All that you are doing is writing your name on the sand. Time is just
sand and nothing else. Time cannot give you any taste of the eternal,
and without that taste one remains frightened of death. The invented
self is always afraid, continuously afraid. It lives in fear, it lives
in paranoia, it lives in neurosis. The discovered self knows nothing of
the abnormal, perverted, neurotic mind. It becomes simple, it becomes
ordinary, but that ordinariness is luminous.</p><p><br></p><p>Kierkegaard calls this attitude of constantly remaining preoccupied
with inventing a self “philistinism”. This means a mediocre existence,
living in the security of the womb, a superficial satisfaction with
everything as it is. It means to live life on the surface and to never
explore its deeper, psychic dimensions. It is the refusal to be born,
the refusal to grow. It means being close-minded to passion, risk and
broader perspectives. It is a state of shut-upness.</p><p><br></p><p>People are living as if they are closed from everywhere. Their
existence is a kind of shut-upness. Their existence is windowless: the
sun never penetrates into their beings, nor the wind, nor the rain. They
simply live closed into themselves. They are afraid of coming into the
open, because if they come into the open people may change their ideas
about them. When they want to cry they laugh, because what will people
think? Crying is sissy! They will condemn. They keep a very strong face,
the face of steel, and behind this is a child who wants to cry, who
wants to play around, who wants to run in the garden after the
butterflies, who wants to collect wildflowers. But that they never
allow: they remain stiff. They go on repressing the child, and that
child is far more valuable than what you are pretending to be because
the child is real, authentic. And the people who live in this kind of
shut-upness cannot grow, because growth means being in constant
communion with existence, being nude with existence, hiding nothing,
keeping no secret, remaining available and vulnerable, remaining open to
all kinds of risks and dangers. Only then does growth happen.</p><p><br></p><p>You see people all over the world growing old, but without growing
up. Even in their old age they remain childish deep down, because they
never allowed their own real self to grow. They have been piling upon
the false self, decorating, bringing more ornaments for the false self,
creating new props so it doesn’t collapse; but this false self cannot
grow. Remember one thing: no false thing can ever grow, it remains
stuck. Can you think of a plastic flower growing? The real rose grows,
the plastic rose remains as it is. It is dead, how can it grow?</p><p><br></p><p>The self that is given to you by others is a dead entity; it cannot
grow, it cannot flow. It is a frozen thing! And with that frozen thing
you will be imprisoned.</p><p>When I look at people, watch their faces and their beings, I am
constantly in deep pain seeing them. Great compassion arises. They could
have been beautiful beings but they have remained retarded. They could
have been glowing beings but there is no glow, there is no fire. And all
that they think they are doing, and all that they think that they are
living, is just so futile. It is futile because it does not bring
growth. The most important thing in life is growth. Religion is the
science of growth. And the beginning of the growth is changing the
gestalt from the false self to the real self. The real is already given,
it is a God-given gift; the false has to be gathered from people, people
who don’t know themselves. How can they give you any sense of reality?
Beware of it!</p><p><br></p><p>The beginning of the inner journey has to start with the question
“Who am I?” And it has to become more and more a quest than a question.
The question means a superficial curiosity, the quest means a passionate
love-affair.</p><p><br></p><p>It will be good to understand this word “question” and the symbol of
the question-mark. The symbol of the question-mark is very significant.
You may be surprised to know that it comes from the first incident in
human history: the meeting of the serpent with Eve near the Tree of
Knowledge. The serpent created the first question in Eve’s mind: to eat
the fruit or not? The question-mark is the snake standing on its tail.
It represents the snake on its tail.</p><p><br></p><p>History begins with a question-mark, the whole of human history; the
serpent started it. He has remained in the symbol, the question-mark,
standing on his tail. He must have stood on his tail and must have
talked to Eve, must have seduced her into eating the fruit of the Tree
of Knowledge.</p><p><br></p><p>In another sense, properly understood, it is also the sign of how
knowledge has come into being. All knowledge starts with questions. To
ask is the beginning of any inquiry. But if the question remains only a
question, then you will remain Adam and you will never become a Christ.
Hence the other symbol has also to be understood: that symbol is the
serpent eating its own tail.</p><p><br></p><p>That symbol has been used by many ancient esoteric schools. It was
used by Rosicrucians, and many gnostics have used the symbol of a snake
eating its own tail. Then the snake becomes a circle. When the snake
starts eating its own tail, it is a quest. Why is it a quest? When a
question remains just a question its interest is in an answer, verbal,
intellectual, but no verbal, intellectual answer can satisfy it. New
questions will arise out of the answer.</p><p><br></p><p>This has been the path of philosophy. Philosophy is synonymous with
the question-mark, the serpent standing on its tail.</p><p><br></p><p>Then what is the history of religion? Just the opposite – the
question eating itself – the snake eating its own tail. In the religious
quest, questions disappear, thirst remains. There comes a moment when
nothing is in your mind, not even the question. The question has eaten
itself up.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what happens in a Zen koan: an absurd question. And why
absurd? – for this particular reason: if it is not absurd then the mind
will supply an answer. And if the mind supplies an answer, out of that
answer ten more questions will arise. And then it will be a regress ad
infinitum; there will be no end to it. Hence an absurd question is given
to the meditator so that mind cannot supply any answer. If no answer is
supplied how long can you go on asking the question, how long? – one
year, two years, three years, four, five, six... one gets tired. A
moment comes when one is so exhausted</p><p>with the question and the futility of it all, and one knows there is
no answer to it. One day, out of sheer exhaustion, the question slips
out of your consciousness. You are left alone, a pure mirror reflecting
nothing.</p><p><br></p><p>The question has eaten itself; that is koan. The snake has started
eating its own tail: now the circle is complete, the perfect circle. The
perfect circle has been the symbol of wisdom. The question is the
beginning of knowledge, the perfect circle is the symbol of wisdom.</p><p><br></p><p>Adam is a question-mark, Jesus is a full circle – so is Buddha, so am
I, so can you be. You come to me as a question-mark, but please don’t go
from here as a question-mark. And don’t go from here becoming a little
more knowledgeable, gathering a few answers – because those answers will
soon become questions. Go from here as a perfect circle – the snake
eating its own tail, and then there will be no more questions.</p><p><br></p><p>And the state of the mind which does not question is the state of
mind which is the answer. Not that any answer comes to you; it itself is
the answer – the silence, the stillness, the utterly contentless
consciousness, is the answer. It is samadhi. And only in samadhi do you
know who you are.</p><p><br></p><p>This small parable.…</p><p><br></p><p>ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A FOX WHO MET A YOUNG RABBIT IN THE WOODS.
THE RABBIT SAID, “WHAT ARE YOU?”</p><p><br></p><p>The rabbit must have been a philosopher.</p><p><br></p><p>THE FOX SAID, “I AM A FOX, AND I COULD EAT YOU IF I WANTED TO.” “HOW
CAN YOU PROVE THAT YOU ARE A FOX?”</p><p>That’s what the philosophic mind always asks: “How can you prove that
you are a fox?”</p><p><br></p><p>People come to me and they ask, “How can you prove that you are
Bhagwan?” There is no need to prove it. I am. And I am very much
surprised, because you also are the same, but completely unaware. Maybe
my declaring that I am God disturbs your sleep. You become angry; you
start thinking, “If this man is God, then why am I not?” You start
feeling inferior.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, that is not the purpose of my declaration. My declaration
includes you! When I am saying I am God, I am saying every human being
is God – and not only every human being, every being is God. To be is to
be God; there is no other way. God is trees in the trees and birds in
the birds and mountains in the mountains, man in man, woman in woman.
God has all these manifestations. All these beautiful waves arise in His
ocean.</p><p><br></p><p>When I declare that I am the ocean, other waves become disturbed.
They think that I am claiming some superiority, that I am saying that
you are only waves and I am an ocean. I am not saying that. By declaring
that I am the ocean I have declared that you are also the ocean.</p><p><br></p><p>But if you don’t want to recognize it, it is your freedom not to see
the truth. You can keep your eyes closed, you can remain blindfolded;
that is your decision. If you have chosen not to be a God you</p><p>can go on pretending not to be a God – but I tell you it is only a
pretension. God is your reality, and whatsoever else you are pretending
is only just a belief. And even when you pretend that you are this and
that and not God, then too you remain God deep down. There is no way of
being anything else.</p><p><br></p><p>Even the wave that says, “I don’t believe in the ocean, and CERTAINLY
I am not the ocean; I can see my limitations: one day I arise, another
day I am gone. How can I be the eternal ocean? I am not!” still, even
while she is declaring it, she is the ocean. She is part of the ocean,
the ocean is underneath, but she has not looked into her own depths.</p><p><br></p><p>Every day newspapers carry one criticism about me: that I am a
self-appointed God. That means a committee is needed to appoint. Maybe a
government has to issue certificates saying who is God and who is not
God, or maybe a university has to issue certificates. The people who
criticize me as a self-appointed God have taken it for granted that God
should be appointed by others. Who are these others, and what right have
they, and who has appointed them? Now it will be a regress, ad
nauseam.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha declared himself, Krishna declared himself, Jesus declared
himself; they were all self- appointed Gods. But there is no other way.
When I have come to know, when I have come to see who I am, what can I
do? I have simply to state the fact. It is a bare, naked truth – and it
is not only my truth.</p><p><br></p><p>If I were declaring that I am God and you are not, then it would be
just an ego-trip. But my declaration includes you, includes the whole
existence. It has nothing to do with me as such; in fact I am no more
there, and only God is. I have dropped the self that you are carrying;
the self that is created by others, I have dropped. And in dropping
that, the real self is discovered.</p><p><br></p><p>THE RABBIT ASKED, “HOW CAN YOU PROVE THAT YOU ARE A FOX?” THE FOX DID
NOT KNOW WHAT TO SAY, BECAUSE IN THE PAST RABBITS HAD ALWAYS RUN FROM
HIM WITHOUT SUCH INQUIRIES.</p><p><br></p><p>THEN THE RABBIT SAID, “LF YOU CAN SHOW ME WRITTEN PROOF THAT YOU ARE
A FOX, I WILL BELIEVE YOU.”</p><p><br></p><p>That is part of the human mind: anything written and people believe
it. The written or the printed word has a hypnotic power over people. I
say something: if it goes against your scripture you come immediately to
me to say that it is not written in the Bible – as if just by writing
something it becomes true. If it is not written in the Bible, so what?
So it is not written in the Bible! Improve upon the Bible – write it. At
least you can write it in your own copy.</p><p><br></p><p>But people believe the written word very much; it is almost hypnotic.
That’s why you can go on believing even stupid newspapers, because a
printed thing, a written thing? – then it must be true. All kinds of
falsities and lies go on being circulated.</p><p><br></p><p>Just the other day I was reading one German newspaper. It says I have
two wives, one Indian, one Western. Looks very relevant... because
that’s why I say “the meeting of the East and the West”! And the more
amazing thing is that the picture that he has chosen to show of my two
wives – one of</p><p>them is Shiva! Shiva has long hairs; he is standing with his back
towards the camera, so he is my Indian wife! It is really nice of these
people.…</p><p><br></p><p>The other newspaper I was reading has written that I fly in a
helicopter. I liked it. I never leave my room... and I fly in
helicopters? True, I fly, but I fly without helicopters! And even a
greater discovery is there – that I eat only eggs, meat, lobsters, and
nothing else!</p><p><br></p><p>Now millions of people in Germany will believe it: a written thing is
a written thing after all.</p><p><br></p><p>Another newspaper has a report that the reporter came to the ashram
early in the morning, at five- thirty. He knocked on the door. A naked,
utterly beautiful woman opened the door, hugged him, welcomed him, “Come
in,” plucked a fruit from this tree – looked like an apple – gave the
fruit to the reporter, and told the reporter, “Eat it. It rejuvenates
sexual energy.”</p><p><br></p><p>And you will be surprised – letters have started arriving. One man
writes from Austria: “I am Sixty and I have a young wife. Please, Osho,
be kind to me. I can come to India. I have heard that in India things
like that happen. Can you give me that fruit?”</p><p><br></p><p>It is believed, and all kinds of rubbish, all kinds of falsities and
lies go on being written. And many believe.</p><p><br></p><p>Satynanda wrote from Germany – now he has come – he wrote from
Germany that “So many lies are being printed in German newspapers. In
Germany it is almost a Rajneesh wave.” He wrote a letter to make us
aware that many kinds of sexual maniacs and perverts will reach, “So be
alert, because many are preparing.” If such fruits are there, and such a
commune exists where all is permitted, where all people live in nudity –
all you people are sitting nude, remember! – where clothes are not
allowed... These reports are being published, and many will believe.
That’s how people believe.</p><p><br></p><p>But I am happy. Let-them come, for ANY reason. Then we will see! I
have even written to this old man, “You come! Fruit or no fruit, but you
come I” Who knows? Doing Dynamic, Kundalini, he may go beyond sex. That
is a possibility.</p><p><br></p><p>THE RABBIT SAID, “IF YOU CAN SHOW ME WRITTEN PROOF THAT YOU ARE A
FOX, I WILL BELIEVE YOU.”</p><p><br></p><p>People believe only when something is written. Why do you believe in
the Vedas? Why do you believe in the Bible? Why do you believe in the
Geeta? It is a written document, ancient, of great prestige. What else
is there?just a great tradition supporting it.</p><p><br></p><p>If there had been no written record of Jesus, you would have
forgotten all about Jesus. There have been many teachers and Masters of
the capacity of Jesus, of the same calibre, but you don’t even know
their names.</p><p><br></p><p>In India, when Buddha existed and Mahavira was alive, there were many
more teachers, at least six of the same calibre, of the same status, but
you will not even know their names.</p><p>One of them was Prakuta Katyiaena, a rare gem. But he insisted that
his words should not be written so that no tradition arise after him.
Certainly his words were not written; no tradition has arisen, but
people have completely forgotten even his name.</p><p><br></p><p>There was another great teacher, Buddha’s contemporary,
Purnakashyapa, but because no scriptures exist – they were written, but
destroyed by the organized religion in India – nobody, knows anything
about him.</p><p><br></p><p>People believe in the written word. People believe too much in their
eyes. One should believe only in one’s own experience. Nothing else
should become a substitute, otherwise you start going false.</p><p><br></p><p>SO THE FOX TROTTED OFF TO THE LION, WHO GAVE HIM A CERTIFICATE THAT
HE WAS A FOX.</p><p><br></p><p>WHEN HE GOT BACK TO WHERE THE RABBIT WAS WAITING, THE FOX STARTED TO
READ OUT THE DOCUMENT. IT SO PLEASED HIM THAT HE DWELT OVER THE
PARAGRAPHS WITH LINGERING DELIGHT.…</p><p><br></p><p>You have also done it many times. If somebody writes a beautiful
letter to you, you read it again and again and again. Why “with great
lingering delight”? Somebody has praised you; it gives you a good sense
of self. People are ready to die to be praised. People are ready to do
anything.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard about a politician. There was a great ceremony, his
birthday was celebrated. Hundreds of rose garlands were presented to
him, but his secretary was a little puzzled because he was not looking
very happy.</p><p><br></p><p>When the ceremony was finished the secretary asked, “You look a
little sad.” He said, “Yes. Only a hundred garlands? And I had paid for
two hundred.” You have to pay for your own garlands.</p><p>People go on paying in subtle ways so that they can be praised. And
there exists a mutual arrangement in the world “You scratch my back, I
will scratch yours,” and both enjoy.</p><p><br></p><p>WHEN HE GOT BACK TO WHERE THE RABBIT WAS WAITING, THE FOX STARTED TO
READ OUT THE DOCUMENT. IT SO PLEASED HIM THAT HE DWELT OVER THE
PARAGRAPHS WITH LINGERING DELIGHT. MEANWHILE, GETTING THE GIST OF THE
MESSAGE FROM THE FIRST FEW LINES, THE RABBIT RAN DOWN A BURROW AND WAS
NEVER SEEN AGAIN.</p><p><br></p><p>THE FOX WENT BACK TO THE LION’S DEN, WHERE HE SAW A DEER TALKING TO
THE LION. THE DEER WAS SAYING, “I WANT TO SEE WRITTEN PROOF THAT YOU ARE
A LION.<span class=s4></span>”</p><p>THE LION SAID, “WHEN I AM NOT HUNGRY, I DON’T NEED TO BOTHER. WHEN I
AM HUNGRY, YOU DON’T NEED ANYTHING IN WRITING.”</p><p><br></p><p>You will know.…</p><p>This is the right approach, the lion’s approach: “Who cares whether
you believe in me or not?”</p><p><br></p><p>If somebody comes to me: “What is the proof that you are God?” who
bothers? I am not here to collect stupid followers. My approach is the
lion’s approach. He said, “When I am not hungry, I don’t need to bother.
When I am hungry, you don’t need anything in writing.”</p><p><br></p><p>And that’s my approach too. If just a curious person comes to me, I
need not bother. I tell him, “Get lost.” If a disciple reaches to me
there is no need for any proof. In his very disciplehood he has got the
proof.</p><p><br></p><p>THE FOX SAID TO THE LION, ” WHY DIDN’T YOU TELL ME TO DO THAT WHEN I
ASKED FOR A CERTIFICATE FOR THE RABBIT?”</p><p><br></p><p>“MY DEAR FRIEND,”SAID THE LION,’ YOU SHOULD HAVE SAID THAT IT WAS
REQUESTED BY A RABBIT. I THOUGHT IT MUST BE FOR A STUPID HUMAN
BEING,FROM WHOM SOME OF THESE IDIOTIC ANIMALS HAVE LEARNED THIS PASTIME.
”</p><p><br></p><p>Except man, who is worried about inventing a self? Except man, nobody
is neurotic on the earth. Except man, nobody has gone astray so far away
from himself that he needs certificates to prove his validity, that he
needs certificates to prove his existence, that he needs certificates to
prove his character, intelligence.</p><p><br></p><p>Either you have intelligence or you don’t have. No certificate is
needed; your life will be its own proof. Your joy will be enough of a
certificate, your bliss will show, will prove it. Nothing else is
needed.</p><p><br></p><p>The moment you come to me I welcome you, I invite you to come closer
and closer to me so that sooner or later you start drinking of the
nectar that has happened to me, that is flowing in me. That will be the
proof; nothing else is needed.</p><p><br></p><p>Mahavira had no proof, Bahaudin had no proof, Jesus had no proof,
Buddha had no proof. They were proofs themselves. Those who have eyes
will be able to see and those who have ears will be able to hear and
those who have hearts will be able to feel. But the human mind has
fallen into great stupidity. Humanity is living by words. Words have
become too important. The word “fire” has become more important than
fire itself. The word “God” has become more important than God itself.
And remember, the word “God” is not God and the word “love” is not
love.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t be deceived by words, beware of words. You can be lost in the
jungle of words and you will be going farther and farther away from
truth.</p><p><br></p><p>Truth is a wordless experience. Truth happens only when there is no
thought in you, when all words have disappeared and all the dust is gone
from the mirror, when the mirror is simply mirroring – and mirroring
nothing. No reflection is made, no wave arises in the lake of your
consciousness. Then all is reflected, then you know what is – not only
that you know who you are, you know what this whole existence is.
Knowing oneself, one knows the whole.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part10>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

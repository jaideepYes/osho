IBN HALIM RELATES THAT HE WENT FIRST TO SEE ONE OF THEM, WHOSE NAME WAS PIR ARDESHIR OF QAZWIN.\nHE SAID TO PIR ARDESHIR, “WILL YOU ADVISE ME AS TO WHAT TO DO AND WHAT NOT TO DO?” THE PIR SAID, “YES, BUT I WILL GIVE YOU SUCH INSTRUCTIONS AS YOU WILL FIND VERY HARD TO CARRY OUT, SINCE THEY WILL GO AGAINST YOUR PREFERENCES, EVEN IF THESE PREFERENCES ARE SOMETIMES FOR HARDSHIP.”\nIBN HALIM SPENT SOME MONTHS WITH PIR ARDESHIR, AND FOUND THAT THE TEACHING WAS INDEED HARD FOR HIM. ALTHOUGH PIR ARDESHIR’S FORMER DISCIPLES WERE NOW FAMED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD AS ENLIGHTENED TEACHERS, HE COULD NOT STAND THE CHANGES, THE UNCERTAINTIES AND THE DISCIPLINES PLACED UPON HIM.\nAT LENGTH HE APPLIED TO THE PIR FOR PERMISSION TO LEAVE, AND TRAVEL TO THE TEKKIA OF THE SECOND TEACHER, MURSHID AMALI.\nHE ASKED THE MURSHID, “WOULD YOU PLACE UPON ME BURDENS WHICH I MIGHT FIND NEXT TO INTOLERABLE?”\nAMALI REPLIED, “I WOULD NOT PLACE UPON YOU SUCH BURDENS.” IBN HALIM ASKED, “WILL YOU THEN ACCEPT ME AS A DISCIPLE?”\nTHE MURSHID ANSWERED, “NOT UNTIL YOU HAVE ASKED ME WHY MY TRAINING WOULD NOT BE SO ONEROUS AS THAT OF PIR ARDESHIR.”\nIBN HALIM ASKED, “WHY WOULD IT NOT BE SO ONEROUS?”\nTHE MURSHID TOLD HIM, “BECAUSE I WOULD NOT CARE FOR YOU AND YOUR REAL WELL- BEING LIKE ARDESHIR CARED FOR YOU. THEREFORE YOU MUST NOT NOW ASK ME TO ACCEPT YOU AS A DISCIPLE.”\nRELIGION IS AS SIMPLE AS THE FISH swimming in the ocean, but man has become very complicated. It is because of man’s complexity that religion looks arduous. Religion cannot be arduous because it is our very nature. It is in our breathing, it is in our heartbeats, it circulates in our blood, it is our very marrow, our very soul. How can it be difficult? The very idea of difficulty arises because of a wrong notion.\nWe have been taught down the ages that religion is a faraway goal and the journey is uphill. In fact, religion is not a goal at all, and there is no journey uphill or downhill. There is no journey possible. Religion is where you are, religion is what you are, religion is your being – there is nowhere to go. And those who go in search, they are moving farther and farther away from religion. To seek is to lose, to search is not to find.\nSeeking becomes more and more difficult; the farther away you reach, the more difficult it becomes, the more frustrating – because the more efforts you make to attain to God, the less is the possibility of attaining him.\nGod is already the case. God is the ocean, we are the fish. And there is no need for a fish to learn swimming.\nI have beard...\nMulla Nasrudin was fishing on a lake. It was a private lake and fishing was absolutely prohibited. And just behind him there was a big board declaring in capital letters: “No fishing allowed. Trespassers will be prosecuted.” But he was sitting on the bank, fishing.\nThe landlord came, caught him red-handed. He asked, “What are you doing?” Mulla laughed. He said, “I was teaching this fish to swim.”\nNo fish needs any teaching to swim. No man needs any religion whatsoever. All that is needed is to become simple. Drop your complexities, drop your unnecessary mind games. Be silent and still and you will find it at the very core of your being; it is waiting there, but it is a very still small voice. Your mind is creating so much noise; that’s why you cannot hear it.\nI have heard...\nAn Englishman and an Irishman were riding on top of a London bus, and the Englishman especially had been annoyed by the confusion, the bustle, the raucous din from all sides. They came in sight of Westminster Abbey, and at this moment the chimes burst forth in a joyous melody.\nThe Englishman turned to his friend and said, “Isn’t that sublime? It is glorious to hear those chimes pealing to heaven, and doesn’t it lift one’s thoughts higher and higher to the Creator of all things?”\nCasey leaned over, hand to his ear. “Ye will have to speak a little louder, George.”\n“Those magnificent chimes, old top – don’t they imbue you with a feeling of reverence, of awe? Doesn’t that golden tintinnabulation reawaken golden memories of a happy past?”\nCasey leaned still closer, face still puzzled. “George, ye’ve gotter speak louder, I can’t hear one word ye’re saying.”\nThe Englishman almost shouted in the other’s ears. “The chimes, old thing, the marvelous chimes! Right-o! Isn’t that pealing melodious? Doesn’t it take you back into the dim vistas of the past when the world was young, and man’s springtime heart faced with a sweet young reverence the awful miracles of godhead?”\nCasey stuck his mouth against the other man’s ear and screamed, “I can’t hear a damned word. Those damned bells are makin’ such a hell of a racket! I can’t hear me own self, drat’em!”\nThe bell is ringing in you. You are the temple, and the bell is continuously ringing in you – it is your life – but there is so much noise. The mind has become a marketplace. You have lost all contact with yourself; that’s why you have lost contact with God. It is not that you have to search for God. Where are you going to search for him? In what direction? You don’t have any address. You don’t know his form, his name. Even if you come across him you will not be able to recognize him, so please don’t start any journey towards God. That is utterly doomed from the very beginning.\nOn the contrary, move inwards, become more silent, become more relaxed, and suddenly one day you will start hearing those beautiful chimes ringing in you. You will start hearing that still, small voice. It is there, you have never lost it for a single moment. It cannot be lost.\nThat’s why all the great seers of the world have insisted that God is your nature. God is within you, his kingdom is within you. There is no need to seek and search.\nThen what is needed? – to fall into silence, to fall into a harmonious, a melodious state of being; to be a no-mind.\nThat’s what Sufis go on doing: dancing, singing, hugging each other, kissing each other. They are pouring themselves into each other, creating an energy-field in which silence easily surfaces. And in silence, God is found. Silence is his face. In the inner music God is found; music is his name. In an utterly lost state, when you are drunk, when you are not left at all, he is found. When you are not, he is. The seeker is too much; that’s why he goes on missing.\nIt is said about the great Sufi mystic, Bayazid, that when Bayazid reached the station of nearness he heard a voice which ordered him, “Ask for something!”\nThe state of nearness is the state when you are falling silent, when voices in your head are disappearing, evaporating, when thoughts are leaving you, deserting you; when you are feeling\nutterly alone, not even shadows of the others are present; when you are just on the verge of disappearing. That is called the “station of nearness”.\nWhen Bayazid reached the station of nearness he heard a voice which ordered him, “Ask for something!”\n“I have no desire,” he replied.\nBut the voice insisted. It said, “You ask for something!”\nAgain he said, “But there is nothing to ask because I have no desire.” But again the voice repeated, “Ask for something!”\nBayazid answered, “Then I want only Thee!”\nThe voice then said, “So long as even an atom of the existence of Bayazid remains, this is impossible.”\nBayazid missed. He was just on the verge. He started asking. He came back – because with the desire you are back, with the desire the mind is back. Even if the desire is for God, that doesn’t matter. You would have thought that this was beautiful, that Bayazid desired God. But desire is desire; what you desire is irrelevant. Desire brings the desiring mind back. Bayazid had again entered into the marketplace, that station of nearness was lost. The moment he said, “I want only Thee,” he was there. Again the I had gathered, and when there is I, it creates thou. When there is I it creates duality, and all is lost in duality. When there is no I, then there is non-duality.\nThen you are one with existence, utterly one. Then you are nothing but a pulsation of existence itself, just a ripple in the lake of this infinite consciousness.\nThe moment he said, “I want only Thee,” the voice then said, “So long as even an atom of the existence of Bayazid remains, this is impossible.”\nMan has to disappear for God to be. All that is needed is this simple phenomenon of disappearance. But because we don’t want to disappear, then the whole approach becomes very arduous. Then we start playing games: on the one hand we want God, and on the other hand we want to protect ourselves.\nAgain it is said of Bayazid that once he was walking along a road with his disciples when they came upon a severed head lying on the way. Upon its forehead was written this tremendously important sutra from the Koran: He loseth both the world and the hereafter.\nBayazid picked up the head and kissed it. When his disciples asked who he was, who this man was, he answered, “This is the head of a Sufi dervish who gave up both worlds for God. I have not yet been able to do it. I had reached to the point where it could have happened, but I missed.”\nOn the severed head these words from the Koran were written: He loseth both the world and the hereafter. One has to lose all, only then is God gained.\nThe people who are searching for God, the people who are searching for enlightenment, nirvana, moksha, or any other name, will go on missing; and their lives will become more and more complicated, and the journey will become harder and harder.\nBut Bayazid had taken a lesson from his first experience. Soon he was again at the station of nearness. Again it was asked, “Bayazid, ask something!” This time he did not even bother to say that “I have nothing to ask” – because even if you say that you have nothing to ask, you are. He simply sat there in utter silence. Again and again the voice provoked him, tempted him, “Ask something, Bayazid!” but there was no answer from Bayazid. Thrice it was repeated, “Bayazid, ask something!” And this voice was God’s voice, this was disrespectful! When God himself is telling you to ask, ask! But Bayazid was not there, there was nobody; so how to be respectful or disrespectful?\nThis is what Sufis call adab: the way of being in the presence of a Master, and ultimately, the way of being in the presence of God.\nThere was no Bayazid, so even this provocation, “Ask, Bayazid! This is disrespectful towards God. I am God myself, asking you to ask something. I am happy with you. I am here to give you all that you want, all that you ask. Even if you ask me, I am ready to give myself to you.”\nBut this time there was nobody, the silence remained undisturbed. There was no response from Bayazid. And he took the ultimate jump, it happened – he became God. This is the way one becomes a God, this is the way one attains.\nIt is said:\n“Who are you?” somebody asked Bayazid.\nHe said, “I lost him years ago. The more I seek him, the less I find.” “Who are you?” the person asked again.\nBayazid said, “There is nothing under my cloak but Allah. Except God, there is nobody within me, so the question ‘who are you?’ is meaningless. I am not, God is. And God is always blissful. God is blissfulness, so the question is irrelevant. There is nobody, nothing under my cloak, except Allah.”\nGod is not there to be found somewhere else – in Kaaba, in Kailash, in Girnar, in Jerusalem. God has to be found under your cloak. And the reality is this: that there is nobody except God within you. But you have not turned upon yourself, your eyes are fixed at distant goals. Your eyes are roaming there somewhere in the future; and God is here, and you are not here. Hence the meeting is difficult. Otherwise there is no difficulty at all.\nSufism is the path of intense love, passionate love. As Bayazid has said, “The duration of Bayazid’s life of asceticism was only three days. On the first day he renounced the world, on the second day he renounced the other world, and on the last day he renounced himself.”\nThere are only three steps. The first step: becoming aware that this world is nothing but games, becoming aware that this world is nothing but our projections; and the second step, becoming aware\nthat the other world, heaven, paradise, is also nothing but our unfulfilled dreams, our unfulfilled desires projected in time, in the future; and the third step, when this world is dropped and that world is dropped, then all that is left is you. Then all that is left is the faculty of projection, the mind, the ego. And the third step consists of dropping the ego. And suddenly you are back home. Suddenly nothing is needed any more, all is available. And then one starts laughing, because this had always been so – all had always been available. Just because we were searching and searching, and we were in such a frantic search that We never looked within; We never looked at the treasure that we are already carrying, we became too much obsessed with the outside world; we forgot the language of the inner, we forgot that there is an interior in us and that interiority is God.\nMeditate over these beautiful lines of D.H. Lawrence:\nAre you willing to be sponged out, Erased, cancelled, made nothing? Are you willing to be made nothing, Dipped into oblivion?\nIf not, you will never really change. The phoenix renews her youth Only when she is burnt, burnt alive,\nBurnt down to hot and flocculent ash.\nThe myth, the beautiful myth of the phoenix, the bird who becomes alive only through death, who renews itself by burning itself, utterly burning itself, whose death becomes resurrection... The myth of the phoenix bird is the myth of all the awakened people.\nJesus is another representation of the same myth: crucifixion and resurrection.\nBayazid says, “I am gone, I am no more.” This is death. But out of this death something deathless arrives, is found. But people are cunning: they would like to have God also. Just as they have a good bank balance, they would like God also to be in their fist. They would like God to be their possession so that they can brag about and claim that “I know God.” But that ego will not allow them.\nGod cannot be possessed. God is not a property. You cannot own God. God is a love affair; you can only dissolve into him. And remember again: the dissolution is not into some thou, the dissolution is simply a let-go into your own being. When you disappear into your own being and there is no Center left which can say “I”, you have known what God is.\nMan is like an ice cube, frozen. God is nothing but the melting of the ice cube. Then you lose your solidity, you become fluid. Then you lose your stagnancy and you become flowing. That flow, yes, that flow is another name for God. Life is another name for God.\nBy creating the temples and the mosques and the churches we have deceived people. We have given them a wrong notion of God, as if God is something separate from life. It is not so. And it is because of this mis-education that has been perpetuated for centuries, because of this wrong conditioning, that whenever people think of God they think of a statue, a temple, a holy place; they never think of themselves.\nStanding before a mirror, looking into your own eyes reflected in the mirror, has the idea ever arisen in you that this is God? No, your priests have destroyed that possibility. And this is the real phenomenon: to recognize God as your own being, pulsating in you, in the very beat of your heart.\nSo the first thing I would like to say to you: God is not difficult to find. The difficulty consists in losing yourself. And this is the statement not of one enlightened person, this is the statement of all the enlightened people of the world. They may have been born in India, in China, in Japan, in Israel, or anywhere else – about this they all agree.\nRumi says: “In a court of justice requiring several witnesses to prove guilt, a prosecutor brought a few Sufis to bear witness with regard to a certain crime. The judge, however, refused to accept the testimony on the grounds that the prosecutor had only one witness, a thousand Sufis being the same as one.”\nThat’s a beautiful story Rumi relates: that the judge refused to accept because many witnesses were needed. Many witnesses were produced but they were all Sufis, so the judge said, “One Sufi or many Sufis does not make much difference, because whatsoever one Sufi says will be said by all the Sufis. So you can bring ten thousand Sufis; it counts only as one.”\nThat’s a beautiful story. Buddha, Christ, Krishna, Lao Tzu, Mohammed, Bahaudin, Bayazid... they are not saying different things... maybe in different ways, but not different things. They are witness to a single truth, and the truth is that the kingdom of God is within you.\nThis story...\nTHERE WERE TWO MEN OF GREAT RENOWN AS TEACHERS OF THE RIGHT PATH. IBN HALIM RELATES THAT HE WENT FIRST TO SEE ONE OF THEM, WHOSE NAME WAS PIR ARDESHIR OF QAZWIN.\nEach word has to be tasted slowly so it melts on your tongue, so you can digest it and its beauty. THERE WERE TWO MEN OF GREAT RENOWN AS TEACHERS OF THE RIGHT PATH.…\nWhat is the right path? You will be surprised to know – right path means no path. All paths are wrong, because a path is needed if there is a distance between you and your goal. The path is relevant only when there is distance. But there is no distance between you and God, so there is no need of any path. No path is the right path.\nIt will look paradoxical, but nothing can be done about it – existence is paradoxical. All paths are wrong paths, because a path will take you farther away. You are not to go anywhere, hence no path is required.\nAnd you are being taught so many paths, and the people who teach you paths look very logical. It appeals to your mind. Naturally you think, “We don’t know God, We don’t know where he is, so a path is needed. We don’t know where God is so unless a path is given to us how are we ever going to reach?” But you are completely oblivious to the fact that God is not there but here, not then but now, that God is not the sought but the seeker. So any path is going to take you astray, any path will misguide you.\nThe teachers who give you paths are pseudo-teachers; they are dangerous people. They have created much chaos in the world, but they are very logical and they appeal to your ordinary mind.\nThe real teacher is one who takes all paths away. The real teacher is one who takes all teachings away. The real teacher is one who unburdens you, who destroys all your knowledge and makes you again ignorant, innocent, like a child. The real teacher is very destructive. When all knowledge is taken away, all paths withdrawn, you don’t know a thing, you are left in your ignorance, naked, nowhere to hide, suddenly the great explosion happens. It always happens in innocence.\nThat’s why Jesus goes on saying, “Unless you are like small children you will not enter into my kingdom of God.”\nThe real teacher makes you like small babes. The real teacher does not teach you information. The real teacher does not inform, he transforms. He does not convey doctrines and dogmas; on the contrary, he takes a sword and cuts your very head. He makes you headless.\nSo what is the right path? “Right path” means no path. But if somebody teaches no path, teaches no teaching, very few people are going to go to him, because it will look so illogical. Only people of great understanding and intelligence will be attracted. That’s why false teachers attract great masses, real teachers attract only the chosen few.\nTHERE WERE TWO MEN OF GREAT RENOWN AS TEACHERS OF THE RIGHT PATH. IBN HALIM RELATES THAT HE WENT FIRST TO SEE ONE OF THEM, WHOSE NAME WAS PIR ARDESHIR OF QAZWIN.\nPir is a Sufi name for a siddha. Pir means one who has arrived – arrived to the place from where he had never gone in the first place, arrived home, arrived to that home which he had never left, which even if he had wanted to leave, he could not.\nTo leave your nature is impossible. Then what happens? People only dream that they have left their home. It is like in the night you sleep and you dream; you dream a thousand and one things, but in the morning you find yourself lying in your bedroom. All those dreams, that you had been to Peking and to Philadelphia and to Timbuktu and to Constantinople, and you have been in Poona all the time and nowhere else; but only in the morning will you recognize the fact, when you are awake, that all that was just dreaming. You had never left you bed, you were always here.\nThat is the situation: nobody has lost God, nobody can. It is impossible. God is your very being, how can we lose him? And if we can lose him we will immediately die, because he is our life. If we lose him then there is no possibility of finding him; so the question is not of finding God, the question is only of remembering. We have only forgotten.\nThat’s why Sufis say zikr, remembrance, is all. That is their very fundamental: just remember, just make yourself alert and remember. Just become more aware and you will start laughing – that you had never left the place and you were thinking how to get back, what methods to use, what paths to follow, what maps are needed. And you were consulting maps and books and teachers and this and that, and all the time you Were simply fast asleep in your own home.\nPir means one who has arrived, one who has come to know that he has never gone anywhere else, that he had always been here, but now he recognizes the fact, that’s all.\nThe moment I say I am God, I am not saying that I have become God – I have been God all along; now just the recognition has come. When I say you are God, I am not saying that you have to become God. If you are not you cannot become. One can become only that which one is, which one already is. You become only that which you are, never anything else. So it is not a question of becoming, it is only a question of awakening to your being, to your facticity, to your truth.\nIbn Halim Went to Pir Ardeshir of Qazwin.\nHE SAID TO PIR ARDESHIR, ” WILL YOU ADVISE ME AS TO WHAT TO DO AND WHAT NOT TO DO?”\nNow this is the beginning of a wrong inquiry. It looks so relevant, it looks so logical. Reading the story you will not see the point immediately – that it is irrelevant; you don’t ask a Master what to do and what not to do.\nWhen you go to a Master you simply surrender to him. Then it is up to him to tell you what to do and what not to do. When you go to a Master, a siddha, a pir, all that is needed is trust. You simply sit silently by his side waiting for the right moment. He knows, he will tell you.\nWhen Bayazid lived with his own Master, he lived for twelve years, just sitting silently. The only thing that he had done, on the first day, was he came, he touched the feet of the Master, and sat silently for twelve years, never asking a question, never asking what to do, just waiting in tremendous trust: “If something is needed to be done, the Master is there and he will tell me. If nothing is needed to be done, then he will not tell me. If silence is needed from his side, then I will go on drinking his silence. If a few words are needed he will utter the words, and he knows, so in the right moment everything will be done.”\nAnd it happened in twelve years. Slowly, slowly he became more and more silent. When you don’t ask a thing, your mind is not fed by information. He just sat there. Thousands of people came and went, and they were asking this question and that, and what to do and what not to do, and, “What is the meaning of the scripture; this passage particularly, what is to be understood by it; a few people say this and few people say that?” Many came and many went, and Bayazid was just sitting there silently. Slowly, slowly he disappeared.\nWhat else can you do, just sitting silently by the side of the Master? How long can your mind go on creating turmoil? When you don’t feed the mind every day it starts dying out of starvation.\nThis was a real fast that Bayazid did; this is fasting. Not eating food is not going to help, not eating information is going to help.\nAnd after twelve years the Master turned towards him, hugged him, and said, “Bayazid, now you can go. You have arrived.” Not a single word was uttered, no message ever given, no instructions, no guidance.\nThis man, Ibn Halim, asked a wrong question.\nHE SAID TO PIR ARDESHIR, ” WILL YOU ADVISE ME AS TO WHAT TO DO AND WHAT NOT TO DO?”\nFirst, to ask such a question is wrong. The disciple has to be there. His very being has to be available to the Master. His very being will tell the Master what is needed, what is not needed – and he will do it, or he will say it, or he will order you. But Ibn Halim must have been a very wise man; he was asking a wise question.\nSecondly, it is wrong because even if you want to ask, ask “What should I be and what should I not be?” First, not asking anything is the best; the second best is asking, “What should I be, what should I not be?” The question should be about being, but he is asking about doing: “What should I do and what should I not do?”\nRemember, doing is the concern of morality, being is the concern of religion. Trust, silence, is the concern of spirituality. The best is to trust, to be silent, to wait in love, in hope, in patience. That is the spiritual relationship. If it is not possible then ask, “What should I be?” That is a religious relationship. The lowest, the third-rate, is to ask what to do, what not to do. That is a moral question. What is right and what is wrong, and what is virtue and what is sin – those are the most ordinary questions.\nRemember, morality is not religion. Religion is not spirituality, although spirituality contains religion and contains morality. Morality cannot contain religion and cannot contain spirituality. That’s why an irreligious person can be moral; there is no problem in it. In fact the irreligious person is found to be more moral than the so-called religious. The irreligious person can be moral, the atheist can be moral – one who does not believe in God, one who does not believe in any hereafter. He can be moral, because morality is only a way of living in convenience with people. It is a calculated step; it is simply functional. It has no other truth.\nThat’s why there are as many moralities as there are societies. One thing may be moral in India, may not be moral in Iran. Or sometimes one thing may be moral to the Hindu and may not be moral to the Christian, and the Christian may be living in the same neighborhood.\nMorality is decided by the society. It has no ultimate truth about it. It is all arbitrary. It is needed, because man is not alone, man lives with so many people. When you live with so many people a few rules and regulations are needed, but those rules and regulations are just like rules of traffic – “Don’t walk in the middle of the road” – they have no ultimate truth about them. Not that if you walk in the middle of the road you have committed a sin and you will be thrown into hell; but walking in the middle of the road, you create an unnecessary nuisance in the traffic. You may be hit. Keep to the left: but that too is not in any way moral; there are countries where you have to keep to the right. Both are good. Either keep to the right or keep to the left so that the traffic moves smoothly. The whole thing is arbitrary. It has a utility in it, but no ultimacy about it.\nWhen you ask what to do and what not to do, you are asking a very ordinary moral question. You are not yet religious. The religious person will ask what to be, what not to be. His concern will be with being, not with doing. Doing is an outer thing, being is inner.\nBut the best is not even to ask that. If you trust, then it is the concern of the Master. You have surrendered, you have opened all your cards before him. You are not even keeping a trump card, you have opened all your cards. That’s what surrender is. Now he knows everything about you; he will do whatsoever is necessary, or if nothing is necessary he will not do anything.\nIbn Halim’s question is third-rate. It is because of the third-rate question that the Pir had to say:\n” YES, BUT I WILL GIVE YOU SUCH INSTRUCTIONS AS YOU WILL FIND VERY HARD TO CARRY OUT, SINCE THEY WILL GO AGAINST YOUR PREFERENCES, EVEN IF THESE PREFERENCES ARE SOMETIMES FOR HARDSHIP.”\nIf you simply surrender to the Master, then life grows spontaneously. In his very presence life grows spontaneously, just as in the presence of the sun trees grow – they don’t ask how to grow; and the buds open and bloom, and they don’t ask how to open their petals and how not to open them, and what is the right way and what is the wrong way; and the birds start singing. As the sun rises on the horizon something starts happening all over the earth. Life is back, sleep disappears, a great awakening.…\nExactly the same is the case when a disciple surrenders to the Master. He simply remains available to his presence and things start happening. The Master functions as a catalytic agent – but that is the highest. It is very rare to have that much trust. It needs guts.\nWhy can’t you have trust? Do you think you are very intelligent, that’s why you can’t have trust? No, you are a coward, full of fear – that’s why you can’t trust. It is fear that prevents trust. Only a fearless person can trust. You are afraid, you may be exploited. You are afraid: “Who knows? This man may be a cheat, a fraud. Who knows where he is trying to lead me? Who knows? I should keep alert and hold myself back. I should always remain sitting on the fence so if something goes wrong I can jump out. I should always keep one foot out, so if there is any danger signal I can run away, I can escape.” This is out of fear.\nRemember, trust is possible only when you are fearless. Only a very brave and courageous person can trust. The world has become very cowardly, that’s why trust has disappeared, faith has disappeared.\nIf it is not possible, then the second question has to be asked: “What should I be?” Then you are not asking about your character, you are asking about meditation. You are not asking what to eat and what not to eat; you are not asking when to get up in the morning and when to go to bed; whether tea is right to take or not; “Is coffee going to disturb my spiritual growth or not?” You are not asking those kinds of nonsense questions. You are simply asking how to be – how to be silent, how to be authentic, how to be still, rooted, centered. This is the second-best.\nThen the Master will tell you – meditation, prayer. Then the Master will teach you by his presence, meditation, prayerfulness, gratitude, thankfulness. He will give you a taste of the benediction that he has.\nTo the first, all will be given. The Master will pour his whole being To the second, a few glimpses will be given, and those glimpses will prepare him to become the first. Then the Master can pour his whole being into him. For the first things will be absolutely easy, utterly easy. Just like the fish swimming in the ocean, the disciple starts swimming in the presence of the Master’s being. It is so easy – as a dewdrop slipping on the grassleaf, or the bird on the wing. It is so easy, it is so spontaneous, for the first.\nFor the second it is a little bit difficult, but not too difficult; just a little bit difficult, because he will have to struggle with the mind to drop the thoughts, to become a witness. To the first it is going to happen in effortlessness; to the second it will happen through effort, but it will happen. For the second the journey will not be uphill but will be downhill. For the first there is no journey, he has arrived. For the second the journey is downhill; it will not be arduous.\nFor the third the journey is going to be uphill. That’s why the Master says, “Yes, but I will give you such instructions as you will find very hard to carry out.”\nTo change your actions without changing your being is very hard, because actions arise out of your being. That is the problem. It is not your actions that are really the problem, the problem is somewhere in your being.\nFor example, a person goes on lying, and the Master says, “Don’t lie.” Now it is going to be difficult. More possibility is that the person will start lying to the Master too. Now he will say, “I don’t lie since you have told me, I have stopped lying.” But more possibility is that he is lying again! Now he is lying to the Master himself.\nWhen a person lies he is simply saying one thing – that in his deep being he has something wrong. He is a liar there in his being. He is living a lie deep in his being and that lie goes on coming on the surface.\nWhatsoever comes on the surface comes from the roots. If you want to destroy a tree, don’t go on pruning the leaves; that is not going to help. Leaves are actions. And that’s what people go on doing: their being is violent and they try to become non-violent. Then on the surface, just on the surface, they manage a veneer, a facade of non-violence. Deep down they remain the same violent people, because no action can change the being.\nIt is like, you can paint your face, but by painting the face your real face is not changed. But if your real face changes, certainly beauty will arise on its own accord.\nRemember, there is no way to change the within by changing the without, because the circumference cannot change the center. The circumference is impotent against the center, but the center can change the circumference. The circumference is nothing but the reflection of the center, so change the center.\nThe second kind of inquirer changes the center. Then the circumference changes automatically. The first kind of disciple drops the circumference, the center, everything in toto, to the Master. He remains unconcerned. He puts everything that he has, good and bad, at the feet of the Master, and is free from that very moment. His trust makes him free, his trust becomes his enlightenment.\nThe second tries to change the center, and through the change of the center the first changes.\nIf you become more meditative many changes will happen. For example, a more meditative person will stop smoking. It will not be possible, because smoking is nothing but a kind of nervousness. Whenever you are nervous you smoke. It keeps you together. But why, what relevance is there? Why does it keep you together when you start smoking? It is a regression. Smoking represents nothing but that you are back at your mother’s breast. Your smoke functions as if you are drinking milk from your mother’s breast. The warmth comes from the hot smoke going in, and the smoke almost gives you the illusion of the milk going in, and the cigarette in your mouth becomes the nipple. Whenever the child was afraid in his childhood he was soothed, calmed. Whenever he was afraid, miserable, angry, sad, the mother would immediately give him her breast. And then he fell asleep; it was very tranquillizing. You are simply repeating that process and nothing else.\nWhen the child cannot find the mother he starts sucking his own thumb as a substitute. And that too helps; if the child sucks his own thumb he falls asleep, he feels good, he believes that it is the mother’s breast. “The mother is close by – I need not be afraid, I need not be nervous. There is no fear, nobody can do me any harm.”\nThat’s what smoking is – a psychological regression. Whenever you are nervous – you are facing a crisis, a challenge, you are going to give an interview, sitting outside the office waiting for your name to be called, you are trembling within – you immediately take your cigarette out of your pocket and you start smoking. It soothes you.\nBut the man who meditates need not stop smoking; it stops on its own accord. It has to stop, because now he no longer feels nervous, he is at home. Being meditative, he starts gaining roots into his being; he is no more trembling, he is not afraid of the world. There is nothing to fear. Even death will not make him afraid, because now he has seen something deathless in himself, he has tasted something of the nectar. Smoking will disappear.\nThat’s why I don’t tell you to do this and to do that. My whole approach is: meditate, and then things will change on their own accord.\nThe meditator, if he really goes in deep meditation, cannot be violent. Violence erupts from you because you go on repressing so much anger that by and by it becomes very sour, bitter, poisonous. And one day it is too much and the steam has to be let out. But the meditator does not repress. He tries to understand rather than repress. His whole approach changes: because he does not repress, he never carries any wounds in him. He does not carry any steam which can explode at any excuse, and sometimes very irrationally, with no excuse also.\nSo these are the three kinds of seekers. The first, the best, is a devotee. He simply surrenders and things start happening, there is no journey. Instantly he has arrived home. Looking into the eyes of the Master, touching his feet, he has arrived. Now he has nowhere to go. But that is a rare phenomenon; very few will be of that intelligence and that fearlessness.\nThe second kind is one who asks about meditations – better than the third, because he is asking a more fundamental question.\nThe third asks a very low kind of question, the lowest. His question is more concerned with morality, character-building, making a beautiful facade. He is not really interested in transformation. Then the journey is difficult, very difficult. For the first there is no journey, for the second an easy journey, for the third a very arduous journey.\n“YES,” SAID THE PIR, “BUT I WILL GIVE YOU SUCH INSTRUCTIONS AS YOU WILL FIND VERY HARD TO CARRY OUT, SINCE THEY WILL GO AGAINST YOUR PREFERENCES.”\nAnd the greatest problem arises when you want to change your actions. The greatest problem is that you have preferred those actions your whole life; you have cultivated them, they have become your second nature. It is not just a question of your mind now, thinking and deciding that “I will not smoke any more.” It is not going to help. Maybe for one or two hours you can try, or for one or two days you can try, but it will come back, and it will come back with great vengeance. And its coming back will destroy whatsoever little self-confidence you had before. That too will be gone. Now you will know that smoking is far stronger than your will; you are defeated. And if it happens again and again, slowly slowly you will lose all trust in yourself.\nThat’s what happens to so-called religious people: they take one vow and they cannot follow it; they take another vow and they fail again, and another; and slowly, slowly the recognition arrives, has to arrive, that “I am such a low person, so ugly, so weak, such a sinner, that I have no worth at all.” That’s what so-called religious people have been reduced to – worthless, meaningless, impotent people.\nThey had started wrongly, they asked a wrong question. Their very first step went wrong.\nWhenever you want to change your action it is going to be against your preferences, otherwise how have you cultivated that action for so long? You must have liked it, notwithstanding what you say. You may be always saying that smoking is not good; that is not the point, what you say. The point is that you have been smoking. Why have you been smoking? There must be something that you are gaining from it.\nThere is something: it gives you a kind of consolation, it gives you a certain security, it gives you an occupation, it helps you to remain together, it takes you away from your nervousness. It has something psychological there for you. You may say that because it brings tuberculosis or cancer, “That’s why I am against it,” but these reasonings won’t help. Tuberculosis may come in thirty years, but the nervousness is now. And there are people who are suffering from tuberculosis and they have never smoked, and there are people who are suffering from cancer and they have never smoked. And there are people who have smoked their whole lives and they are not suffering from cancer. So all these things are there in the mind – “Who knows?...”\nSo for something uncertain, how can you surrender that which is certain? – that right now smoking is going to give you a little more confidence. And you are going to give an interview. Your boss has called you and you are afraid. Just puffing on your cigarette will give a good puff to your chest. You will be a little warmer, blood will be circulating better. A little more nicotine in the blood and you will be standing straight, and you will be able to look eye to eye at the boss. Without this cigarette you will be limp and loose, and you will not know what to say and how to say it. You may start trembling and you may mis-manage the whole thing, you may mess up the whole thing. This is right now,\nimmediate. Who bothers about a tuberculosis that will come after thirty years? Who knows if you are going to live thirty years? Seeing the traffic and the accidents and the aeroplanes falling and the trains... who knows? And wars are there. Who knows about thirty years? The question is right now – and the cigarette is going to help you right now... unless you know something better.\nIf you can sit silently just for a single minute and watch your breath, that will give you real confidence, not created by nicotine. That will give you real silence, and not dependent on any chemical.\nBut meditation will have to be learned.\nDon’t ask how to change your actions, ask how to change the Very roots of your actions. And actions are always going to be against preferences. And sometimes it happens: even if these preferences are sometimes for hardship, then too you have lived with them for so long that they have a certain appeal.\nPeople are great rationalizers; they go on rationallizing. Even if they are creating misery in their lives, they go on finding beautiful reasons for their misery. They say it is duty, they say it is sacrifice. They find beautiful labels. Remember, man is very cunning and very clever in finding rationalizations. There are millions of people who are unnecessarily suffering but they think their suffering has great value. The idea that their suffering has great value keeps them in the suffering.\nMany people unnecessarily travel long where shortcuts are available, but they have become accustomed to the long journey. They won’t choose the shortcut. The shortcut is so new – it may be comfortable, it may be convenient, but it is so new – that is the trouble.\nThe mind always likes the old. It does not like the new because the new creates a little insecurity in you. You don’t know how to tackle it. Who knows? You may fail, you may not succeed. It is better to always go through the old way; you are perfectly acquainted with it.\nSo the Pir is right. He says “..EVEN IF THESE PREFERENCES ARE SOMETIMES FOR HARDSHIP.”\nJust the other day I was reading an article against me. The person who has written says, if I really want to help this country, I should become like Dayananda and Vivekananda; only then can I help this country. Now, this is how the mind functions.\nDayanandas and Vivekanandas have existed here by the millions. Have they helped the country? Nobody will ask that question. How have they helped the country? And if they have helped, what is the need for me to help your country? So many Dayanandas and so many Vivekanandas have existed – what have they done?\nIn fact, they are the causes of your misery! But you have become accustomed to them. You have started liking them because you have been acquainted with them for thousands of years. They have a great appeal because they fit with your mind – and your mind is the cause of your misery! They fit with your mind: they are also part of the cause of your misery.\nThe author who has written the article against me says that I teach people to live an earthly life. Our real saints have never taught that; they have always taught people to renounce the earthly life.\nThat I know. That’s why you are suffering. That’s why you are poor – because you have forgotten how to live on this earth! Nobody has taught you how to live on this earth, how to love this earth. They have all taught you that this earth is ugly, that it is a punishment that you have been sent here, that you are not supposed to enjoy. If you enjoy, you will be sent again. You are supposed to be very sad, detached. You have to renounce all the joys of the earth so next time you don’t have to be born, and then you will enjoy heavenly pleasures.\nBecause these people have been talking too much about the “other world”, they have destroyed this world. I teach you this earth.\nThis very earth, the paradise. This very body the Buddha.\nI am not a Dayananda, and I don’t want to be a Dayananda. And if you think Dayananda is a saint, then I don’t want to be called a saint either; then that very word becomes ugly to me, obscene.\nThese are the people who have destroyed you, poisoned you. But the appeal is there because they are old and you are acquainted with them and they are not alone; they have happened in the thousands. And they have been telling it so often, continuously, for centuries. Adolf Hitler has written in his autobiography, MEIN KAMPF, that if you repeat a lie continuously, it becomes a truth. And that’s what has happened in this country. For thousands of years a few lies have been repeated: that God is against the world.\nHe is not. If he is against the world, then why does he go on perpetuating this world? If he is against this world, then he is the greatest sinner. Why does he go on giving life to this world? Why do trees grow? Why are children born? Why does life continue? And you call him omnipotent. Can’t he simply say, “Stop!” Just as one day he said, “Let there be light,” and there was light, now let him say, “Let there be darkness,” so there will be darkness. “Let there be death.” He can simply finish the whole nonsense in a single stroke – if he is against it.\nIf a poet is against his poetry, he will not write it. If a painter is against his painting, he will burn it. If a musician is against his music, he will throw his veena, he will destroy it; what is the point?\nGod must be in utter love with the world. He is.\nYour Dayanandas and your Vivekanandas are utterly wrong, but because they have been repeating an ancient lie, you go on believing in them.\nNow, I look wrong to you, naturally, obviously. Centuries of repetition, and suddenly I am here and I am saying that God is in love with the world, and you also be in love with the world, don’t renounce it, live it in great joy, celebrate it. Naturally, I look like I am against religion. I am not, Dayananda is.\nDayananda is not a religious person at all. He is certainly a great scholar, a great logic chopper, a great hairsplitter, but if you look deep down, then there are only words and words and nothing else; no spiritual experience of his own. But this country praised him very much because he praised this country! This is how we satisfy each other – a mutual arrangement of ego satisfaction.\nHe said this country is the holiest country in the world. He said Hindus are the Aryans. He changed their names because, he said, “Hindu” is not our real name; it was given by the other people;\nforeigners have given it to us. Just as the whole world calls Germans Germans, but that is not their name; and the whole world calls Japan Japan, but that is not its name; exactly like this, Dayananda said, others have called us Hindus. This is not our name; our name is Aryans. And the word ary means “the noble ones, the noblest ones, the chosen few of God”.\nAdolf Hitler has also chosen to call his Nordic race the Aryans – the noble people of the world, the people who are born to dominate the world.\nNow, this satisfied the Hindu ego very much. They praised Dayananda as if he were a reincarnation of God.\nHe was just a mere scholar, and all his argumentation was childish, ugly, irreligious, because he was fighting against all religions: Christianity is wrong, Buddhism is wrong, Jainism is wrong, Islam is wrong. All religions are wrong except the Aryan religion. I don’t call him religious at all.\nI call Ramakrishna religious – who said all religions are the same, who said all religions reach to the same experience, who said, “I have known not from one window, but from all the windows, and I have seen the same vision again and again.” He tried Hindu methods, he tried Mohammedan methods, he tried Christian methods, he tried Buddhist methods; and again and again he said, “I have come to the same experience from all possible ways. God is one, and the experience of God is one.”\nRamakrishna was a religious person. He was a contemporary of Dayananda. Dayananda was not a religious person at all, but the man who has written the article seems to be a follower of Dayananda.\nAnd so is the case with Vivekananda. His Master, Ramakrishna, was an enlightened person, but not Vivekananda. Vivekananda was just a good missionary, clever, intelligent, articulate, educated, well versed in the ways of philosophy, but that’s all.\nI am not a Dayananda and I am not a Vivekananda, and I don’t want to be. But people go on saying and asking these things.\nAnd they don’t see the point that all these people have been worshiping poverty, and if you worship poverty, poverty can never be destroyed. I hate poverty! I call poverty the greatest disease. It has to be destroyed, not worshiped. These people have been saying again and again that poverty is something spiritual. I say poverty is the most unspiritual thing in the world.\nRichness is spiritual, and outer richness creates possibilities for inner richness.\nBut certainly, my statements will go against their preferences. Although their preferences lead them into hardship, misery, starvation, still they will cling to their old mind. The mind always clings to the old. It has no guts to go with the new; it is always afraid to go into the uncharted ocean. It remains tethered to the known, to the familiar territory.\nIBN HALIM SPENT SOME MONTHS WITH PIR ARDESHIR, AND FOUND THAT THE TEACHING WAS INDEED HARD FOR HIM. ALTHOUGH PIR ARDESHIR’S FORMER DISCIPLES WERE NOW FAMED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD AS ENLIGHTENED TEACHERS, HE COULD NOT STAND THE CHANGES, THE UNCERTAINTIES AND THE DISCIPLINES PLACED UPON HIM.\nAnd that is bound to happen. When you move into some inner work, your old certainties will disappear because the old mind will start losing its hold on you and you will become more uncertain.\nAnd what actually happens when people come to seek truth? They have come really to seek certainty, not truth. They want to be absolutely certain so they can be secure and safe. But when you start searching, your old certainties will go, because old certainties are based on lies. And before new certainties come the old will have to go and there will be a transitory period when you will be almost in a chaos, when you will be almost not knowing at all what is going to happen and what is happening.\n... HE COULD NOT STAND THE CHANGES, THE UNCERTAINTIES AND THE DISCIPLINES PLACED UPON HIM. AT LENGTH HE APPLIED TO THE PIR FOR PERMISSION TO LEAVE, AND TRAVELED TO THE TEKKIA OF THE SECOND TEACHER, MURSHID AMALI. HE ASKED THE MURSHID, “WOULD YOU PLACE UPON ME BURDENS WHICH I MIGHT FIND NEXT TO INTOLERABLE?”\nNow from the very beginning he wants to be certain that no burdens should be placed upon him, no hardships, no uncertainties, no disciplines. People want truth to be very cheap. They want it without paying any cost for it.\nAMALI REPLIED, “I WOULD NOT PLACE UPON YOU SUCH BURDENS.” IBN HALIM ASKED, “WILL YOU THEN ACCEPT ME AS A DISCIPLE?”\nHe must have been utterly happy, exhilarated with the prospect of finding a Master who was not going to put any hardships on him.\nTHE MURSHID ANSWERED, “NOT UNTIL YOU HAVE ASKED ME WHY MY TRAINING WOULD NOT BE SO ONEROUS AS THAT OF PIR ARDESHIR.”\nIBN HALIM ASKED, “WHY SHOULD IT NOT BE SO ONEROUS?”\nTHE MURSHID TOLD HIM, “BECAUSE I WOULD NOT CARE FOR YOU AND YOUR REAL WELL- BEING LIKE ARDESHIR CARED FOR YOU. THEREFORE YOU MUST NOT NOW ASK ME TO ACCEPT YOU AS A DISCIPLE.”\nThe moment the disciple asks, “Give me God in a cheap way,” he is not worthy of being accepted as a disciple. The moment the disciple says, “Don’t ask any hardship for me to go through, I don’t want to go through any pain, any agony,” then he is not ready to be a disciple.\nHe had asked a wrong question of the Pir, now he was asking an even more wrong question of the Murshid.\nMurshid means the Master.\nThe Master said, “Because I WOULD NOT CARE FOR YOU... You are not worth caring for.\nThe Master cares only for one who is ready to surrender.\n“And your well-being... I cannot take care of that too like Ardeshir cared for you. That’s why he had put so many hardships for you to go through: he loved you. But you have destroyed that possibility. And if you could not get through that beautiful man and his help, it is useless to waste my time.\n“THEREFORE YOU MUST NOT ASK ME TO ACCEPT YOU AS A DISCIPLE.”\nTo be accepted as a disciple needs surrender. One needs to die into the Master, only then does one become a disciple.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"9860","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_secret/part17/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_secret/>The Secret</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">17 Are You Willing To Be Made Nothing?</h1><div class=post-meta>47 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;9860 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Secret/part17.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part16>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

TEACHING WAS INDEED HARD FOR HIM. ALTHOUGH PIR ARDESHIR’S FORMER
DISCIPLES WERE NOW FAMED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD AS ENLIGHTENED TEACHERS,
HE COULD NOT STAND THE CHANGES, THE UNCERTAINTIES AND THE DISCIPLINES
PLACED UPON HIM.</p><p><br></p><p>AT LENGTH HE APPLIED TO THE PIR FOR PERMISSION TO LEAVE, AND TRAVEL

WOULD NOT BE SO ONEROUS AS THAT OF PIR ARDESHIR.”</p><p><br></p><p>IBN HALIM ASKED, “WHY WOULD IT NOT BE SO ONEROUS?”</p><p><br></p><p>THE MURSHID TOLD HIM, “BECAUSE I WOULD NOT CARE FOR YOU AND YOUR REAL

ME TO ACCEPT YOU AS A DISCIPLE.”</p><p><br></p><p>RELIGION IS AS SIMPLE AS THE FISH swimming in the ocean, but man has
become very complicated. It is because of man’s complexity that religion
looks arduous. Religion cannot be arduous because it is our very nature.
It is in our breathing, it is in our heartbeats, it circulates in our
blood, it is our very marrow, our very soul. How can it be difficult?
The very idea of difficulty arises because of a wrong notion.</p><p><br></p><p>We have been taught down the ages that religion is a faraway goal and
the journey is uphill. In fact, religion is not a goal at all, and there
is no journey uphill or downhill. There is no journey possible. Religion
is where you are, religion is what you are, religion is your being –
there is nowhere to go. And those who go in search, they are moving
farther and farther away from religion. To seek is to lose, to search is
not to find.</p><p><br></p><p>Seeking becomes more and more difficult; the farther away you reach,
the more difficult it becomes, the more frustrating – because the more
efforts you make to attain to God, the less is the possibility of
attaining him.</p><p><br></p><p>God is already the case. God is the ocean, we are the fish. And there
is no need for a fish to learn swimming.</p><p><br></p><p>I have beard...</p><p><br></p><p>Mulla Nasrudin was fishing on a lake. It was a private lake and
fishing was absolutely prohibited. And just behind him there was a big
board declaring in capital letters: “No fishing allowed. Trespassers
will be prosecuted.” But he was sitting on the bank, fishing.</p><p><br></p><p>The landlord came, caught him red-handed. He asked, “What are you
doing?” Mulla laughed. He said, “I was teaching this fish to swim.”</p><p>No fish needs any teaching to swim. No man needs any religion
whatsoever. All that is needed is to become simple. Drop your
complexities, drop your unnecessary mind games. Be silent and still and
you will find it at the very core of your being; it is waiting there,
but it is a very still small voice. Your mind is creating so much noise;
that’s why you cannot hear it.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard...</p><p><br></p><p>An Englishman and an Irishman were riding on top of a London bus, and
the Englishman especially had been annoyed by the confusion, the bustle,
the raucous din from all sides. They came in sight of Westminster Abbey,
and at this moment the chimes burst forth in a joyous melody.</p><p>The Englishman turned to his friend and said, “Isn’t that sublime? It
is glorious to hear those chimes pealing to heaven, and doesn’t it lift
one’s thoughts higher and higher to the Creator of all things?”</p><p><br></p><p>Casey leaned over, hand to his ear. “Ye will have to speak a little
louder, George.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Those magnificent chimes, old top – don’t they imbue you with a
feeling of reverence, of awe? Doesn’t that golden tintinnabulation
reawaken golden memories of a happy past?”</p><p><br></p><p>Casey leaned still closer, face still puzzled. “George, ye’ve gotter
speak louder, I can’t hear one word ye’re saying.”</p><p><br></p><p>The Englishman almost shouted in the other’s ears. “The chimes, old
thing, the marvelous chimes! Right-o! Isn’t that pealing melodious?
Doesn’t it take you back into the dim vistas of the past when the world
was young, and man’s springtime heart faced with a sweet young reverence
the awful miracles of godhead?”</p><p><br></p><p>Casey stuck his mouth against the other man’s ear and screamed, “I
can’t hear a damned word. Those damned bells are makin’ such a hell of a
racket! I can’t hear me own self, drat’em!”</p><p><br></p><p>The bell is ringing in you. You are the temple, and the bell is
continuously ringing in you – it is your life – but there is so much
noise. The mind has become a marketplace. You have lost all contact with
yourself; that’s why you have lost contact with God. It is not that you
have to search for God. Where are you going to search for him? In what
direction? You don’t have any address. You don’t know his form, his
name. Even if you come across him you will not be able to recognize him,
so please don’t start any journey towards God. That is utterly doomed
from the very beginning.</p><p><br></p><p>On the contrary, move inwards, become more silent, become more
relaxed, and suddenly one day you will start hearing those beautiful
chimes ringing in you. You will start hearing that still, small voice.
It is there, you have never lost it for a single moment. It cannot be
lost.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why all the great seers of the world have insisted that God is
your nature. God is within you, his kingdom is within you. There is no
need to seek and search.</p><p><br></p><p>Then what is needed? – to fall into silence, to fall into a
harmonious, a melodious state of being; to be a no-mind.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what Sufis go on doing: dancing, singing, hugging each other,
kissing each other. They are pouring themselves into each other,
creating an energy-field in which silence easily surfaces. And in
silence, God is found. Silence is his face. In the inner music God is
found; music is his name. In an utterly lost state, when you are drunk,
when you are not left at all, he is found. When you are not, he is. The
seeker is too much; that’s why he goes on missing.</p><p><br></p><p>It is said about the great Sufi mystic, Bayazid, that when Bayazid
reached the station of nearness he heard a voice which ordered him, “Ask
for something!”</p><p><br></p><p>The state of nearness is the state when you are falling silent, when
voices in your head are disappearing, evaporating, when thoughts are
leaving you, deserting you; when you are feeling</p><p>utterly alone, not even shadows of the others are present; when you
are just on the verge of disappearing. That is called the “station of
nearness”.</p><p><br></p><p>When Bayazid reached the station of nearness he heard a voice which
ordered him, “Ask for something!”</p><p><br></p><p>“I have no desire,” he replied.</p><p><br></p><p>But the voice insisted. It said, “You ask for something!”</p><p><br></p><p>Again he said, “But there is nothing to ask because I have no
desire.” But again the voice repeated, “Ask for something!”</p><p>Bayazid answered, “Then I want only Thee!”</p><p><br></p><p>The voice then said, “So long as even an atom of the existence of
Bayazid remains, this is impossible.”</p><p><br></p><p>Bayazid missed. He was just on the verge. He started asking. He came
back – because with the desire you are back, with the desire the mind is
back. Even if the desire is for God, that doesn’t matter. You would have
thought that this was beautiful, that Bayazid desired God. But desire is
desire; what you desire is irrelevant. Desire brings the desiring mind
back. Bayazid had again entered into the marketplace, that station of
nearness was lost. The moment he said, “I want only Thee,” he was there.
Again the I had gathered, and when there is I, it creates thou. When
there is I it creates duality, and all is lost in duality. When there is
no I, then there is non-duality.</p><p><br></p><p>Then you are one with existence, utterly one. Then you are nothing
but a pulsation of existence itself, just a ripple in the lake of this
infinite consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>The moment he said, “I want only Thee,” the voice then said, “So long
as even an atom of the existence of Bayazid remains, this is
impossible.”</p><p><br></p><p>Man has to disappear for God to be. All that is needed is this simple
phenomenon of disappearance. But because we don’t want to disappear,
then the whole approach becomes very arduous. Then we start playing
games: on the one hand we want God, and on the other hand we want to
protect ourselves.</p><p><br></p><p>Again it is said of Bayazid that once he was walking along a road
with his disciples when they came upon a severed head lying on the way.
Upon its forehead was written this tremendously important sutra from the
Koran: He loseth both the world and the hereafter.</p><p><br></p><p>Bayazid picked up the head and kissed it. When his disciples asked
who he was, who this man was, he answered, “This is the head of a Sufi
dervish who gave up both worlds for God. I have not yet been able to do
it. I had reached to the point where it could have happened, but I
missed.”</p><p><br></p><p>On the severed head these words from the Koran were written: He
loseth both the world and the hereafter. One has to lose all, only then
is God gained.</p><p>The people who are searching for God, the people who are searching
for enlightenment, nirvana, moksha, or any other name, will go on
missing; and their lives will become more and more complicated, and the
journey will become harder and harder.</p><p><br></p><p>But Bayazid had taken a lesson from his first experience. Soon he was
again at the station of nearness. Again it was asked, “Bayazid, ask
something!” This time he did not even bother to say that “I have nothing
to ask” – because even if you say that you have nothing to ask, you are.
He simply sat there in utter silence. Again and again the voice provoked
him, tempted him, “Ask something, Bayazid!” but there was no answer from
Bayazid. Thrice it was repeated, “Bayazid, ask something!” And this
voice was God’s voice, this was disrespectful! When God himself is
telling you to ask, ask! But Bayazid was not there, there was nobody; so
how to be respectful or disrespectful?</p><p><br></p><p>This is what Sufis call adab: the way of being in the presence of a
Master, and ultimately, the way of being in the presence of God.</p><p><br></p><p>There was no Bayazid, so even this provocation, “Ask, Bayazid! This
is disrespectful towards God. I am God myself, asking you to ask
something. I am happy with you. I am here to give you all that you want,
all that you ask. Even if you ask me, I am ready to give myself to
you.”</p><p><br></p><p>But this time there was nobody, the silence remained undisturbed.
There was no response from Bayazid. And he took the ultimate jump, it
happened – he became God. This is the way one becomes a God, this is the
way one attains.</p><p><br></p><p>It is said:</p><p><br></p><p>“Who are you?” somebody asked Bayazid.</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I lost him years ago. The more I seek him, the less I
find.” “Who are you?” the person asked again.</p><p>Bayazid said, “There is nothing under my cloak but Allah. Except God,
there is nobody within me, so the question ‘who are you?’ is
meaningless. I am not, God is. And God is always blissful. God is
blissfulness, so the question is irrelevant. There is nobody, nothing
under my cloak, except Allah.”</p><p><br></p><p>God is not there to be found somewhere else – in Kaaba, in Kailash,
in Girnar, in Jerusalem. God has to be found under your cloak. And the
reality is this: that there is nobody except God within you. But you
have not turned upon yourself, your eyes are fixed at distant goals.
Your eyes are roaming there somewhere in the future; and God is here,
and you are not here. Hence the meeting is difficult. Otherwise there is
no difficulty at all.</p><p><br></p><p>Sufism is the path of intense love, passionate love. As Bayazid has
said, “The duration of Bayazid’s life of asceticism was only three days.
On the first day he renounced the world, on the second day he renounced
the other world, and on the last day he renounced himself.”</p><p><br></p><p>There are only three steps. The first step: becoming aware that this
world is nothing but games, becoming aware that this world is nothing
but our projections; and the second step, becoming aware</p><p>that the other world, heaven, paradise, is also nothing but our
unfulfilled dreams, our unfulfilled desires projected in time, in the
future; and the third step, when this world is dropped and that world is
dropped, then all that is left is you. Then all that is left is the
faculty of projection, the mind, the ego. And the third step consists of
dropping the ego. And suddenly you are back home. Suddenly nothing is
needed any more, all is available. And then one starts laughing, because
this had always been so – all had always been available. Just because we
were searching and searching, and we were in such a frantic search that
We never looked within; We never looked at the treasure that we are
already carrying, we became too much obsessed with the outside world; we
forgot the language of the inner, we forgot that there is an interior in
us and that interiority is God.</p><p><br></p><p>Meditate over these beautiful lines of D.H. Lawrence:</p><p><br></p><p>Are you willing to be sponged out, Erased, cancelled, made nothing?
Are you willing to be made nothing, Dipped into oblivion?</p><p>If not, you will never really change. The phoenix renews her youth
Only when she is burnt, burnt alive,</p><p>Burnt down to hot and flocculent ash.</p><p><br></p><p>The myth, the beautiful myth of the phoenix, the bird who becomes
alive only through death, who renews itself by burning itself, utterly
burning itself, whose death becomes resurrection... The myth of the
phoenix bird is the myth of all the awakened people.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus is another representation of the same myth: crucifixion and
resurrection.</p><p><br></p><p>Bayazid says, “I am gone, I am no more.” This is death. But out of
this death something deathless arrives, is found. But people are
cunning: they would like to have God also. Just as they have a good bank
balance, they would like God also to be in their fist. They would like
God to be their possession so that they can brag about and claim that “I
know God.” But that ego will not allow them.</p><p><br></p><p>God cannot be possessed. God is not a property. You cannot own God.
God is a love affair; you can only dissolve into him. And remember
again: the dissolution is not into some thou, the dissolution is simply
a let-go into your own being. When you disappear into your own being and
there is no Center left which can say “I”, you have known what God
is.</p><p><br></p><p>Man is like an ice cube, frozen. God is nothing but the melting of
the ice cube. Then you lose your solidity, you become fluid. Then you
lose your stagnancy and you become flowing. That flow, yes, that flow is
another name for God. Life is another name for God.</p><p>By creating the temples and the mosques and the churches we have
deceived people. We have given them a wrong notion of God, as if God is
something separate from life. It is not so. And it is because of this
mis-education that has been perpetuated for centuries, because of this
wrong conditioning, that whenever people think of God they think of a
statue, a temple, a holy place; they never think of themselves.</p><p><br></p><p>Standing before a mirror, looking into your own eyes reflected in the
mirror, has the idea ever arisen in you that this is God? No, your
priests have destroyed that possibility. And this is the real
phenomenon: to recognize God as your own being, pulsating in you, in the
very beat of your heart.</p><p><br></p><p>So the first thing I would like to say to you: God is not difficult
to find. The difficulty consists in losing yourself. And this is the
statement not of one enlightened person, this is the statement of all
the enlightened people of the world. They may have been born in India,
in China, in Japan, in Israel, or anywhere else – about this they all
agree.</p><p><br></p><p>Rumi says: “In a court of justice requiring several witnesses to
prove guilt, a prosecutor brought a few Sufis to bear witness with
regard to a certain crime. The judge, however, refused to accept the
testimony on the grounds that the prosecutor had only one witness, a
thousand Sufis being the same as one.”</p><p><br></p><p>That’s a beautiful story Rumi relates: that the judge refused to
accept because many witnesses were needed. Many witnesses were produced
but they were all Sufis, so the judge said, “One Sufi or many Sufis does
not make much difference, because whatsoever one Sufi says will be said
by all the Sufis. So you can bring ten thousand Sufis; it counts only as
one.”</p><p><br></p><p>That’s a beautiful story. Buddha, Christ, Krishna, Lao Tzu, Mohammed,
Bahaudin, Bayazid... they are not saying different things... maybe in
different ways, but not different things. They are witness to a single
truth, and the truth is that the kingdom of God is within you.</p><p><br></p><p>This story...</p><p><br></p><p>THERE WERE TWO MEN OF GREAT RENOWN AS TEACHERS OF THE RIGHT PATH. IBN
HALIM RELATES THAT HE WENT FIRST TO SEE ONE OF THEM, WHOSE NAME WAS PIR
ARDESHIR OF QAZWIN.</p><p><br></p><p>Each word has to be tasted slowly so it melts on your tongue, so you
can digest it and its beauty. THERE WERE TWO MEN OF GREAT RENOWN AS
TEACHERS OF THE RIGHT PATH.…</p><p>What is the right path? You will be surprised to know – right path
means no path. All paths are wrong, because a path is needed if there is
a distance between you and your goal. The path is relevant only when
there is distance. But there is no distance between you and God, so
there is no need of any path. No path is the right path.</p><p><br></p><p>It will look paradoxical, but nothing can be done about it –
existence is paradoxical. All paths are wrong paths, because a path will
take you farther away. You are not to go anywhere, hence no path is
required.</p><p>And you are being taught so many paths, and the people who teach you
paths look very logical. It appeals to your mind. Naturally you think,
“We don’t know God, We don’t know where he is, so a path is needed. We
don’t know where God is so unless a path is given to us how are we ever
going to reach?” But you are completely oblivious to the fact that God
is not there but here, not then but now, that God is not the sought but
the seeker. So any path is going to take you astray, any path will
misguide you.</p><p><br></p><p>The teachers who give you paths are pseudo-teachers; they are
dangerous people. They have created much chaos in the world, but they
are very logical and they appeal to your ordinary mind.</p><p><br></p><p>The real teacher is one who takes all paths away. The real teacher is
one who takes all teachings away. The real teacher is one who unburdens
you, who destroys all your knowledge and makes you again ignorant,
innocent, like a child. The real teacher is very destructive. When all
knowledge is taken away, all paths withdrawn, you don’t know a thing,
you are left in your ignorance, naked, nowhere to hide, suddenly the
great explosion happens. It always happens in innocence.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why Jesus goes on saying, “Unless you are like small children
you will not enter into my kingdom of God.”</p><p><br></p><p>The real teacher makes you like small babes. The real teacher does
not teach you information. The real teacher does not inform, he
transforms. He does not convey doctrines and dogmas; on the contrary, he
takes a sword and cuts your very head. He makes you headless.</p><p><br></p><p>So what is the right path? “Right path” means no path. But if
somebody teaches no path, teaches no teaching, very few people are going
to go to him, because it will look so illogical. Only people of great
understanding and intelligence will be attracted. That’s why false
teachers attract great masses, real teachers attract only the chosen
few.</p><p><br></p><p>THERE WERE TWO MEN OF GREAT RENOWN AS TEACHERS OF THE RIGHT PATH. IBN
HALIM RELATES THAT HE WENT FIRST TO SEE ONE OF THEM, WHOSE NAME WAS PIR
ARDESHIR OF QAZWIN.</p><p><br></p><p>Pir is a Sufi name for a siddha. Pir means one who has arrived –
arrived to the place from where he had never gone in the first place,
arrived home, arrived to that home which he had never left, which even
if he had wanted to leave, he could not.</p><p><br></p><p>To leave your nature is impossible. Then what happens? People only
dream that they have left their home. It is like in the night you sleep
and you dream; you dream a thousand and one things, but in the morning
you find yourself lying in your bedroom. All those dreams, that you had
been to Peking and to Philadelphia and to Timbuktu and to
Constantinople, and you have been in Poona all the time and nowhere
else; but only in the morning will you recognize the fact, when you are
awake, that all that was just dreaming. You had never left you bed, you
were always here.</p><p><br></p><p>That is the situation: nobody has lost God, nobody can. It is
impossible. God is your very being, how can we lose him? And if we can
lose him we will immediately die, because he is our life. If we lose him
then there is no possibility of finding him; so the question is not of
finding God, the question is only of remembering. We have only
forgotten.</p><p>That’s why Sufis say zikr, remembrance, is all. That is their very
fundamental: just remember, just make yourself alert and remember. Just
become more aware and you will start laughing – that you had never left
the place and you were thinking how to get back, what methods to use,
what paths to follow, what maps are needed. And you were consulting maps
and books and teachers and this and that, and all the time you Were
simply fast asleep in your own home.</p><p><br></p><p>Pir means one who has arrived, one who has come to know that he has
never gone anywhere else, that he had always been here, but now he
recognizes the fact, that’s all.</p><p><br></p><p>The moment I say I am God, I am not saying that I have become God – I
have been God all along; now just the recognition has come. When I say
you are God, I am not saying that you have to become God. If you are not
you cannot become. One can become only that which one is, which one
already is. You become only that which you are, never anything else. So
it is not a question of becoming, it is only a question of awakening to
your being, to your facticity, to your truth.</p><p><br></p><p>Ibn Halim Went to Pir Ardeshir of Qazwin.</p><p><br></p><p>HE SAID TO PIR ARDESHIR, ” WILL YOU ADVISE ME AS TO WHAT TO DO AND
WHAT NOT TO DO?”</p><p><br></p><p>Now this is the beginning of a wrong inquiry. It looks so relevant,
it looks so logical. Reading the story you will not see the point
immediately – that it is irrelevant; you don’t ask a Master what to do
and what not to do.</p><p><br></p><p>When you go to a Master you simply surrender to him. Then it is up to
him to tell you what to do and what not to do. When you go to a Master,
a siddha, a pir, all that is needed is trust. You simply sit silently by
his side waiting for the right moment. He knows, he will tell you.</p><p><br></p><p>When Bayazid lived with his own Master, he lived for twelve years,
just sitting silently. The only thing that he had done, on the first
day, was he came, he touched the feet of the Master, and sat silently
for twelve years, never asking a question, never asking what to do, just
waiting in tremendous trust: “If something is needed to be done, the
Master is there and he will tell me. If nothing is needed to be done,
then he will not tell me. If silence is needed from his side, then I
will go on drinking his silence. If a few words are needed he will utter
the words, and he knows, so in the right moment everything will be
done.”</p><p><br></p><p>And it happened in twelve years. Slowly, slowly he became more and
more silent. When you don’t ask a thing, your mind is not fed by
information. He just sat there. Thousands of people came and went, and
they were asking this question and that, and what to do and what not to
do, and, “What is the meaning of the scripture; this passage
particularly, what is to be understood by it; a few people say this and
few people say that?” Many came and many went, and Bayazid was just
sitting there silently. Slowly, slowly he disappeared.</p><p><br></p><p>What else can you do, just sitting silently by the side of the
Master? How long can your mind go on creating turmoil? When you don’t
feed the mind every day it starts dying out of starvation.</p><p><br></p><p>This was a real fast that Bayazid did; this is fasting. Not eating
food is not going to help, not eating information is going to help.</p><p>And after twelve years the Master turned towards him, hugged him, and
said, “Bayazid, now you can go. You have arrived.” Not a single word was
uttered, no message ever given, no instructions, no guidance.</p><p><br></p><p>This man, Ibn Halim, asked a wrong question.</p><p><br></p><p>HE SAID TO PIR ARDESHIR, ” WILL YOU ADVISE ME AS TO WHAT TO DO AND
WHAT NOT TO DO?”</p><p><br></p><p>First, to ask such a question is wrong. The disciple has to be there.
His very being has to be available to the Master. His very being will
tell the Master what is needed, what is not needed – and he will do it,
or he will say it, or he will order you. But Ibn Halim must have been a
very wise man; he was asking a wise question.</p><p><br></p><p>Secondly, it is wrong because even if you want to ask, ask “What
should I be and what should I not be?” First, not asking anything is the
best; the second best is asking, “What should I be, what should I not
be?” The question should be about being, but he is asking about doing:
“What should I do and what should I not do?”</p><p><br></p><p>Remember, doing is the concern of morality, being is the concern of
religion. Trust, silence, is the concern of spirituality. The best is to
trust, to be silent, to wait in love, in hope, in patience. That is the
spiritual relationship. If it is not possible then ask, “What should I
be?” That is a religious relationship. The lowest, the third-rate, is to
ask what to do, what not to do. That is a moral question. What is right
and what is wrong, and what is virtue and what is sin – those are the
most ordinary questions.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember, morality is not religion. Religion is not spirituality,
although spirituality contains religion and contains morality. Morality
cannot contain religion and cannot contain spirituality. That’s why an
irreligious person can be moral; there is no problem in it. In fact the
irreligious person is found to be more moral than the so-called
religious. The irreligious person can be moral, the atheist can be moral
– one who does not believe in God, one who does not believe in any
hereafter. He can be moral, because morality is only a way of living in
convenience with people. It is a calculated step; it is simply
functional. It has no other truth.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why there are as many moralities as there are societies. One
thing may be moral in India, may not be moral in Iran. Or sometimes one
thing may be moral to the Hindu and may not be moral to the Christian,
and the Christian may be living in the same neighborhood.</p><p><br></p><p>Morality is decided by the society. It has no ultimate truth about
it. It is all arbitrary. It is needed, because man is not alone, man
lives with so many people. When you live with so many people a few rules
and regulations are needed, but those rules and regulations are just
like rules of traffic – “Don’t walk in the middle of the road” – they
have no ultimate truth about them. Not that if you walk in the middle of
the road you have committed a sin and you will be thrown into hell; but
walking in the middle of the road, you create an unnecessary nuisance in
the traffic. You may be hit. Keep to the left: but that too is not in
any way moral; there are countries where you have to keep to the right.
Both are good. Either keep to the right or keep to the left so that the
traffic moves smoothly. The whole thing is arbitrary. It has a utility
in it, but no ultimacy about it.</p><p>When you ask what to do and what not to do, you are asking a very
ordinary moral question. You are not yet religious. The religious person
will ask what to be, what not to be. His concern will be with being, not
with doing. Doing is an outer thing, being is inner.</p><p><br></p><p>But the best is not even to ask that. If you trust, then it is the
concern of the Master. You have surrendered, you have opened all your
cards before him. You are not even keeping a trump card, you have opened
all your cards. That’s what surrender is. Now he knows everything about
you; he will do whatsoever is necessary, or if nothing is necessary he
will not do anything.</p><p><br></p><p>Ibn Halim’s question is third-rate. It is because of the third-rate
question that the Pir had to say:</p><p><br></p><p>” YES, BUT I WILL GIVE YOU SUCH INSTRUCTIONS AS YOU WILL FIND VERY
HARD TO CARRY OUT, SINCE THEY WILL GO AGAINST YOUR PREFERENCES, EVEN IF
THESE PREFERENCES ARE SOMETIMES FOR HARDSHIP.”</p><p><br></p><p>If you simply surrender to the Master, then life grows spontaneously.
In his very presence life grows spontaneously, just as in the presence
of the sun trees grow – they don’t ask how to grow; and the buds open
and bloom, and they don’t ask how to open their petals and how not to
open them, and what is the right way and what is the wrong way; and the
birds start singing. As the sun rises on the horizon something starts
happening all over the earth. Life is back, sleep disappears, a great
awakening.…</p><p><br></p><p>Exactly the same is the case when a disciple surrenders to the
Master. He simply remains available to his presence and things start
happening. The Master functions as a catalytic agent – but that is the
highest. It is very rare to have that much trust. It needs guts.</p><p><br></p><p>Why can’t you have trust? Do you think you are very intelligent,
that’s why you can’t have trust? No, you are a coward, full of fear –
that’s why you can’t trust. It is fear that prevents trust. Only a
fearless person can trust. You are afraid, you may be exploited. You are
afraid: “Who knows? This man may be a cheat, a fraud. Who knows where he
is trying to lead me? Who knows? I should keep alert and hold myself
back. I should always remain sitting on the fence so if something goes
wrong I can jump out. I should always keep one foot out, so if there is
any danger signal I can run away, I can escape.” This is out of
fear.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember, trust is possible only when you are fearless. Only a very
brave and courageous person can trust. The world has become very
cowardly, that’s why trust has disappeared, faith has disappeared.</p><p><br></p><p>If it is not possible, then the second question has to be asked:
“What should I be?” Then you are not asking about your character, you
are asking about meditation. You are not asking what to eat and what not
to eat; you are not asking when to get up in the morning and when to go
to bed; whether tea is right to take or not; “Is coffee going to disturb
my spiritual growth or not?” You are not asking those kinds of nonsense
questions. You are simply asking how to be – how to be silent, how to be
authentic, how to be still, rooted, centered. This is the
second-best.</p><p><br></p><p>Then the Master will tell you – meditation, prayer. Then the Master
will teach you by his presence, meditation, prayerfulness, gratitude,
thankfulness. He will give you a taste of the benediction that he
has.</p><p>To the first, all will be given. The Master will pour his whole being
To the second, a few glimpses will be given, and those glimpses will
prepare him to become the first. Then the Master can pour his whole
being into him. For the first things will be absolutely easy, utterly
easy. Just like the fish swimming in the ocean, the disciple starts
swimming in the presence of the Master’s being. It is so easy – as a
dewdrop slipping on the grassleaf, or the bird on the wing. It is so
easy, it is so spontaneous, for the first.</p><p><br></p><p>For the second it is a little bit difficult, but not too difficult;
just a little bit difficult, because he will have to struggle with the
mind to drop the thoughts, to become a witness. To the first it is going
to happen in effortlessness; to the second it will happen through
effort, but it will happen. For the second the journey will not be
uphill but will be downhill. For the first there is no journey, he has
arrived. For the second the journey is downhill; it will not be
arduous.</p><p><br></p><p>For the third the journey is going to be uphill. That’s why the
Master says, “Yes, but I will give you such instructions as you will
find very hard to carry out.<span class=s4></span>”</p><p><br></p><p>To change your actions without changing your being is very hard,
because actions arise out of your being. That is the problem. It is not
your actions that are really the problem, the problem is somewhere in
your being.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, a person goes on lying, and the Master says, “Don’t
lie.” Now it is going to be difficult. More possibility is that the
person will start lying to the Master too. Now he will say, “I don’t lie
since you have told me, I have stopped lying.” But more possibility is
that he is lying again! Now he is lying to the Master himself.</p><p><br></p><p>When a person lies he is simply saying one thing – that in his deep
being he has something wrong. He is a liar there in his being. He is
living a lie deep in his being and that lie goes on coming on the
surface.</p><p><br></p><p>Whatsoever comes on the surface comes from the roots. If you want to
destroy a tree, don’t go on pruning the leaves; that is not going to
help. Leaves are actions. And that’s what people go on doing: their
being is violent and they try to become non-violent. Then on the
surface, just on the surface, they manage a veneer, a facade of
non-violence. Deep down they remain the same violent people, because no
action can change the being.</p><p><br></p><p>It is like, you can paint your face, but by painting the face your
real face is not changed. But if your real face changes, certainly
beauty will arise on its own accord.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember, there is no way to change the within by changing the
without, because the circumference cannot change the center. The
circumference is impotent against the center, but the center can change
the circumference. The circumference is nothing but the reflection of
the center, so change the center.</p><p><br></p><p>The second kind of inquirer changes the center. Then the
circumference changes automatically. The first kind of disciple drops
the circumference, the center, everything in toto, to the Master. He
remains unconcerned. He puts everything that he has, good and bad, at
the feet of the Master, and is free from that very moment. His trust
makes him free, his trust becomes his enlightenment.</p><p>The second tries to change the center, and through the change of the
center the first changes.</p><p><br></p><p>If you become more meditative many changes will happen. For example,
a more meditative person will stop smoking. It will not be possible,
because smoking is nothing but a kind of nervousness. Whenever you are
nervous you smoke. It keeps you together. But why, what relevance is
there? Why does it keep you together when you start smoking? It is a
regression. Smoking represents nothing but that you are back at your
mother’s breast. Your smoke functions as if you are drinking milk from
your mother’s breast. The warmth comes from the hot smoke going in, and
the smoke almost gives you the illusion of the milk going in, and the
cigarette in your mouth becomes the nipple. Whenever the child was
afraid in his childhood he was soothed, calmed. Whenever he was afraid,
miserable, angry, sad, the mother would immediately give him her breast.
And then he fell asleep; it was very tranquillizing. You are simply
repeating that process and nothing else.</p><p><br></p><p>When the child cannot find the mother he starts sucking his own thumb
as a substitute. And that too helps; if the child sucks his own thumb he
falls asleep, he feels good, he believes that it is the mother’s breast.
“The mother is close by – I need not be afraid, I need not be nervous.
There is no fear, nobody can do me any harm.”</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what smoking is – a psychological regression. Whenever you are
nervous – you are facing a crisis, a challenge, you are going to give an
interview, sitting outside the office waiting for your name to be
called, you are trembling within – you immediately take your cigarette
out of your pocket and you start smoking. It soothes you.</p><p><br></p><p>But the man who meditates need not stop smoking; it stops on its own
accord. It has to stop, because now he no longer feels nervous, he is at
home. Being meditative, he starts gaining roots into his being; he is no
more trembling, he is not afraid of the world. There is nothing to fear.
Even death will not make him afraid, because now he has seen something
deathless in himself, he has tasted something of the nectar. Smoking
will disappear.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why I don’t tell you to do this and to do that. My whole
approach is: meditate, and then things will change on their own
accord.</p><p><br></p><p>The meditator, if he really goes in deep meditation, cannot be
violent. Violence erupts from you because you go on repressing so much
anger that by and by it becomes very sour, bitter, poisonous. And one
day it is too much and the steam has to be let out. But the meditator
does not repress. He tries to understand rather than repress. His whole
approach changes: because he does not repress, he never carries any
wounds in him. He does not carry any steam which can explode at any
excuse, and sometimes very irrationally, with no excuse also.</p><p><br></p><p>So these are the three kinds of seekers. The first, the best, is a
devotee. He simply surrenders and things start happening, there is no
journey. Instantly he has arrived home. Looking into the eyes of the
Master, touching his feet, he has arrived. Now he has nowhere to go. But
that is a rare phenomenon; very few will be of that intelligence and
that fearlessness.</p><p><br></p><p>The second kind is one who asks about meditations – better than the
third, because he is asking a more fundamental question.</p><p>The third asks a very low kind of question, the lowest. His question
is more concerned with morality, character-building, making a beautiful
facade. He is not really interested in transformation. Then the journey
is difficult, very difficult. For the first there is no journey, for the
second an easy journey, for the third a very arduous journey.</p><p><br></p><p>“YES,” SAID THE PIR, “BUT I WILL GIVE YOU SUCH INSTRUCTIONS AS YOU
WILL FIND VERY HARD TO CARRY OUT, SINCE THEY WILL GO AGAINST YOUR
PREFERENCES.”</p><p><br></p><p>And the greatest problem arises when you want to change your actions.
The greatest problem is that you have preferred those actions your whole
life; you have cultivated them, they have become your second nature. It
is not just a question of your mind now, thinking and deciding that “I
will not smoke any more.” It is not going to help. Maybe for one or two
hours you can try, or for one or two days you can try, but it will come
back, and it will come back with great vengeance. And its coming back
will destroy whatsoever little self-confidence you had before. That too
will be gone. Now you will know that smoking is far stronger than your
will; you are defeated. And if it happens again and again, slowly slowly
you will lose all trust in yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what happens to so-called religious people: they take one vow
and they cannot follow it; they take another vow and they fail again,
and another; and slowly, slowly the recognition arrives, has to arrive,
that “I am such a low person, so ugly, so weak, such a sinner, that I
have no worth at all.” That’s what so-called religious people have been
reduced to – worthless, meaningless, impotent people.</p><p><br></p><p>They had started wrongly, they asked a wrong question. Their very
first step went wrong.</p><p><br></p><p>Whenever you want to change your action it is going to be against
your preferences, otherwise how have you cultivated that action for so
long? You must have liked it, notwithstanding what you say. You may be
always saying that smoking is not good; that is not the point, what you
say. The point is that you have been smoking. Why have you been smoking?
There must be something that you are gaining from it.</p><p><br></p><p>There is something: it gives you a kind of consolation, it gives you
a certain security, it gives you an occupation, it helps you to remain
together, it takes you away from your nervousness. It has something
psychological there for you. You may say that because it brings
tuberculosis or cancer, “That’s why I am against it,” but these
reasonings won’t help. Tuberculosis may come in thirty years, but the
nervousness is now. And there are people who are suffering from
tuberculosis and they have never smoked, and there are people who are
suffering from cancer and they have never smoked. And there are people
who have smoked their whole lives and they are not suffering from
cancer. So all these things are there in the mind – “Who knows?...”</p><p><br></p><p>So for something uncertain, how can you surrender that which is
certain? – that right now smoking is going to give you a little more
confidence. And you are going to give an interview. Your boss has called
you and you are afraid. Just puffing on your cigarette will give a good
puff to your chest. You will be a little warmer, blood will be
circulating better. A little more nicotine in the blood and you will be
standing straight, and you will be able to look eye to eye at the boss.
Without this cigarette you will be limp and loose, and you will not know
what to say and how to say it. You may start trembling and you may
mis-manage the whole thing, you may mess up the whole thing. This is
right now,</p><p>immediate. Who bothers about a tuberculosis that will come after
thirty years? Who knows if you are going to live thirty years? Seeing
the traffic and the accidents and the aeroplanes falling and the
trains... who knows? And wars are there. Who knows about thirty years?
The question is right now – and the cigarette is going to help you right
now... unless you know something better.</p><p><br></p><p>If you can sit silently just for a single minute and watch your
breath, that will give you real confidence, not created by nicotine.
That will give you real silence, and not dependent on any chemical.</p><p><br></p><p>But meditation will have to be learned.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t ask how to change your actions, ask how to change the Very
roots of your actions. And actions are always going to be against
preferences. And sometimes it happens: even if these preferences are
sometimes for hardship, then too you have lived with them for so long
that they have a certain appeal.</p><p><br></p><p>People are great rationalizers; they go on rationallizing. Even if
they are creating misery in their lives, they go on finding beautiful
reasons for their misery. They say it is duty, they say it is sacrifice.
They find beautiful labels. Remember, man is very cunning and very
clever in finding rationalizations. There are millions of people who are
unnecessarily suffering but they think their suffering has great value.
The idea that their suffering has great value keeps them in the
suffering.</p><p><br></p><p>Many people unnecessarily travel long where shortcuts are available,
but they have become accustomed to the long journey. They won’t choose
the shortcut. The shortcut is so new – it may be comfortable, it may be
convenient, but it is so new – that is the trouble.</p><p><br></p><p>The mind always likes the old. It does not like the new because the
new creates a little insecurity in you. You don’t know how to tackle it.
Who knows? You may fail, you may not succeed. It is better to always go
through the old way; you are perfectly acquainted with it.</p><p><br></p><p>So the Pir is right. He says “..EVEN IF THESE PREFERENCES ARE
SOMETIMES FOR HARDSHIP.”</p><p><br></p><p>Just the other day I was reading an article against me. The person
who has written says, if I really want to help this country, I should
become like Dayananda and Vivekananda; only then can I help this
country. Now, this is how the mind functions.</p><p><br></p><p>Dayanandas and Vivekanandas have existed here by the millions. Have
they helped the country? Nobody will ask that question. How have they
helped the country? And if they have helped, what is the need for me to
help your country? So many Dayanandas and so many Vivekanandas have
existed – what have they done?</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, they are the causes of your misery! But you have become
accustomed to them. You have started liking them because you have been
acquainted with them for thousands of years. They have a great appeal
because they fit with your mind – and your mind is the cause of your
misery! They fit with your mind: they are also part of the cause of your
misery.</p><p><br></p><p>The author who has written the article against me says that I teach
people to live an earthly life. Our real saints have never taught that;
they have always taught people to renounce the earthly life.</p><p>That I know. That’s why you are suffering. That’s why you are poor –
because you have forgotten how to live on this earth! Nobody has taught
you how to live on this earth, how to love this earth. They have all
taught you that this earth is ugly, that it is a punishment that you
have been sent here, that you are not supposed to enjoy. If you enjoy,
you will be sent again. You are supposed to be very sad, detached. You
have to renounce all the joys of the earth so next time you don’t have
to be born, and then you will enjoy heavenly pleasures.</p><p><br></p><p>Because these people have been talking too much about the “other
world”, they have destroyed this world. I teach you this earth.</p><p><br></p><p>This very earth, the paradise. This very body the Buddha.</p><p><br></p><p>I am not a Dayananda, and I don’t want to be a Dayananda. And if you
think Dayananda is a saint, then I don’t want to be called a saint
either; then that very word becomes ugly to me, obscene.</p><p><br></p><p>These are the people who have destroyed you, poisoned you. But the
appeal is there because they are old and you are acquainted with them
and they are not alone; they have happened in the thousands. And they
have been telling it so often, continuously, for centuries. Adolf Hitler
has written in his autobiography, MEIN KAMPF, that if you repeat a lie
continuously, it becomes a truth. And that’s what has happened in this
country. For thousands of years a few lies have been repeated: that God
is against the world.</p><p><br></p><p>He is not. If he is against the world, then why does he go on
perpetuating this world? If he is against this world, then he is the
greatest sinner. Why does he go on giving life to this world? Why do
trees grow? Why are children born? Why does life continue? And you call
him omnipotent. Can’t he simply say, “Stop!” Just as one day he said,
“Let there be light,” and there was light, now let him say, “Let there
be darkness,” so there will be darkness. “Let there be death.” He can
simply finish the whole nonsense in a single stroke – if he is against
it.</p><p><br></p><p>If a poet is against his poetry, he will not write it. If a painter
is against his painting, he will burn it. If a musician is against his
music, he will throw his veena, he will destroy it; what is the
point?</p><p><br></p><p>God must be in utter love with the world. He is.</p><p><br></p><p>Your Dayanandas and your Vivekanandas are utterly wrong, but because
they have been repeating an ancient lie, you go on believing in
them.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, I look wrong to you, naturally, obviously. Centuries of
repetition, and suddenly I am here and I am saying that God is in love
with the world, and you also be in love with the world, don’t renounce
it, live it in great joy, celebrate it. Naturally, I look like I am
against religion. I am not, Dayananda is.</p><p><br></p><p>Dayananda is not a religious person at all. He is certainly a great
scholar, a great logic chopper, a great hairsplitter, but if you look
deep down, then there are only words and words and nothing else; no
spiritual experience of his own. But this country praised him very much
because he praised this country! This is how we satisfy each other – a
mutual arrangement of ego satisfaction.</p><p><br></p><p>He said this country is the holiest country in the world. He said
Hindus are the Aryans. He changed their names because, he said, “Hindu”
is not our real name; it was given by the other people;</p><p>foreigners have given it to us. Just as the whole world calls Germans
Germans, but that is not their name; and the whole world calls Japan
Japan, but that is not its name; exactly like this, Dayananda said,
others have called us Hindus. This is not our name; our name is Aryans.
And the word ary means “the noble ones, the noblest ones, the chosen few
of God”.</p><p><br></p><p>Adolf Hitler has also chosen to call his Nordic race the Aryans – the
noble people of the world, the people who are born to dominate the
world.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, this satisfied the Hindu ego very much. They praised Dayananda
as if he were a reincarnation of God.</p><p><br></p><p>He was just a mere scholar, and all his argumentation was childish,
ugly, irreligious, because he was fighting against all religions:
Christianity is wrong, Buddhism is wrong, Jainism is wrong, Islam is
wrong. All religions are wrong except the Aryan religion. I don’t call
him religious at all.</p><p><br></p><p>I call Ramakrishna religious – who said all religions are the same,
who said all religions reach to the same experience, who said, “I have
known not from one window, but from all the windows, and I have seen the
same vision again and again.” He tried Hindu methods, he tried
Mohammedan methods, he tried Christian methods, he tried Buddhist
methods; and again and again he said, “I have come to the same
experience from all possible ways. God is one, and the experience of God
is one.”</p><p><br></p><p>Ramakrishna was a religious person. He was a contemporary of
Dayananda. Dayananda was not a religious person at all, but the man who
has written the article seems to be a follower of Dayananda.</p><p><br></p><p>And so is the case with Vivekananda. His Master, Ramakrishna, was an
enlightened person, but not Vivekananda. Vivekananda was just a good
missionary, clever, intelligent, articulate, educated, well versed in
the ways of philosophy, but that’s all.</p><p><br></p><p>I am not a Dayananda and I am not a Vivekananda, and I don’t want to
be. But people go on saying and asking these things.</p><p><br></p><p>And they don’t see the point that all these people have been
worshiping poverty, and if you worship poverty, poverty can never be
destroyed. I hate poverty! I call poverty the greatest disease. It has
to be destroyed, not worshiped. These people have been saying again and
again that poverty is something spiritual. I say poverty is the most
unspiritual thing in the world.</p><p><br></p><p>Richness is spiritual, and outer richness creates possibilities for
inner richness.</p><p><br></p><p>But certainly, my statements will go against their preferences.
Although their preferences lead them into hardship, misery, starvation,
still they will cling to their old mind. The mind always clings to the
old. It has no guts to go with the new; it is always afraid to go into
the uncharted ocean. It remains tethered to the known, to the familiar
territory.</p><p><br></p><p>IBN HALIM SPENT SOME MONTHS WITH PIR ARDESHIR, AND FOUND THAT THE
TEACHING WAS INDEED HARD FOR HIM. ALTHOUGH PIR ARDESHIR’S FORMER
DISCIPLES WERE NOW FAMED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD AS ENLIGHTENED TEACHERS,
HE COULD NOT STAND THE CHANGES, THE UNCERTAINTIES AND THE DISCIPLINES
PLACED UPON HIM.</p><p>And that is bound to happen. When you move into some inner work, your
old certainties will disappear because the old mind will start losing
its hold on you and you will become more uncertain.</p><p><br></p><p>And what actually happens when people come to seek truth? They have
come really to seek certainty, not truth. They want to be absolutely
certain so they can be secure and safe. But when you start searching,
your old certainties will go, because old certainties are based on lies.
And before new certainties come the old will have to go and there will
be a transitory period when you will be almost in a chaos, when you will
be almost not knowing at all what is going to happen and what is
happening.</p><p><br></p><p>... HE COULD NOT STAND THE CHANGES, THE UNCERTAINTIES AND THE
DISCIPLINES PLACED UPON HIM. AT LENGTH HE APPLIED TO THE PIR FOR
PERMISSION TO LEAVE, AND TRAVELED TO THE TEKKIA OF THE SECOND TEACHER,
MURSHID AMALI. HE ASKED THE MURSHID, “WOULD YOU PLACE UPON ME BURDENS
WHICH I MIGHT FIND NEXT TO INTOLERABLE?”</p><p><br></p><p>Now from the very beginning he wants to be certain that no burdens
should be placed upon him, no hardships, no uncertainties, no
disciplines. People want truth to be very cheap. They want it without
paying any cost for it.</p><p><br></p><p>AMALI REPLIED, “I WOULD NOT PLACE UPON YOU SUCH BURDENS.” IBN HALIM
ASKED, “WILL YOU THEN ACCEPT ME AS A DISCIPLE?”</p><p><br></p><p>He must have been utterly happy, exhilarated with the prospect of
finding a Master who was not going to put any hardships on him.</p><p><br></p><p>THE MURSHID ANSWERED, “NOT UNTIL YOU HAVE ASKED ME WHY MY TRAINING
WOULD NOT BE SO ONEROUS AS THAT OF PIR ARDESHIR.”</p><p><br></p><p>IBN HALIM ASKED, “WHY SHOULD IT NOT BE SO ONEROUS?”</p><p><br></p><p>THE MURSHID TOLD HIM, “BECAUSE I WOULD NOT CARE FOR YOU AND YOUR REAL
WELL- BEING LIKE ARDESHIR CARED FOR YOU. THEREFORE YOU MUST NOT NOW ASK
ME TO ACCEPT YOU AS A DISCIPLE.”</p><p><br></p><p>The moment the disciple asks, “Give me God in a cheap way,” he is not
worthy of being accepted as a disciple. The moment the disciple says,
“Don’t ask any hardship for me to go through, I don’t want to go through
any pain, any agony,” then he is not ready to be a disciple.</p><p><br></p><p>He had asked a wrong question of the Pir, now he was asking an even
more wrong question of the Murshid.</p><p><br></p><p>Murshid means the Master.</p><p><br></p><p>The Master said, “Because I WOULD NOT CARE FOR YOU... You are not
worth caring for.</p><p>The Master cares only for one who is ready to surrender.</p><p><br></p><p>“And your well-being... I cannot take care of that too like Ardeshir
cared for you. That’s why he had put so many hardships for you to go
through: he loved you. But you have destroyed that possibility. And if
you could not get through that beautiful man and his help, it is useless
to waste my time.</p><p><br></p><p>“THEREFORE YOU MUST NOT ASK ME TO ACCEPT YOU AS A DISCIPLE.”</p><p><br></p><p>To be accepted as a disciple needs surrender. One needs to die into
the Master, only then does one become a disciple.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part16>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

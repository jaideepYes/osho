FINALLY SHE CAME TO A GARDEN. THERE STOOD THE TREE OF HEAVEN, AND FROM ITS BRANCHES HUNG THE BRIGHT FRUIT OF HEAVEN.\nSTANDING BESIDE THE TREE WAS SABAR, THE FIRST DERVISH.\n“WHY DID YOU NOT TELL ME WHEN WE FIRST MET THAT YOU WERE THE CUSTODIAN OF THE FRUIT OF HEAVEN?” SHE ASKED HIM.\n“BECAUSE YOU WOULD NOT THEN HAVE BELIEVED ME. BESIDES, THE TREE PRODUCES FRUIT ONLY ONCE IN THIRTY YEARS AND THIRTY DAYS.”\nONCE UPON A TIME THERE LIVED a very poor man in a village in Italy. He desperately wanted to know the answer to the mystery of existence, so he decided to work very hard and travel to the Himalayas and find a guru. He worked long arduous hours and at the end of twenty years he had saved his fare.\nHe had been on a ship for about two weeks when a tremendous storm blew up and he was shipwrecked, and found himself on a desert island. He spent the next twenty years on the island when one day he managed to finally attract the attention of a tanker. They picked him up and took him to Bombay where he caught a plane. He had managed to salvage some of his money when shipwrecked.\nHowever, during the flight he was hijacked by the hijackers. But the hijackers decided to set him free in the desert. He walked to a village and waited for the bus to take him to the Himalayas.\nWithin a few months the bus came and he caught it to the foothills of the Himalayas. He then spent a long time on foot but finally managed to arrive at the guru’s cave. He then asked the guru his question about the mystery of life.\nThe guru replied, “Life is a river.”\nThe man went crazy, threw his arms up and shouted at the guru, “For fifty years I have been trying to get to you. I had to work very hard for the fare. I was shipwrecked and then hijacked, and bloody hell – now you tell me life is a river?!”\nAnd the guru said, “Isn’t it?”\nLife is not a problem or a puzzle to be solved. Life is a mystery to be loved and to be lived. And the mystery is not something far away, the mystery is something that is very obvious, herenow. The mystery is the this-ness of existence; hence the answer of the guru, “Life is a river.”\nHe must have been sitting on the bank of the river watching the river go by. In that moment his consciousness was full of the river, there was nothing else but the river.\nAnother Master was asked, “What is truth?” and he said, “The cypress tree in the courtyard.” He must have been looking at the beautiful cypress in the courtyard; that was all in that moment. That moment was full of the cypress tree, that moment was nothing but the cypress tree.\nAnd another Master when asked, “What is life?” was drinking tea. He said, “A cup of tea.” This-ness, idam, or suchness, tathata – that’s what life is.\nAnother, still another Master, was weighing flax, and he was asked, “What is Buddha?” and he said, “Three pounds of flax.”\nThese answers are tremendously important. They don’t appear important on the surface. It certainly can drive a person who has been working for fifty years to reach to the Master crazy, who has wasted his whole life to reach to the Master, to know the mystery of life – and the Master says, “Life is a\nriver,” or “A cup of tea,” or “The cypress tree in the courtyard,” or “Three pounds of flax.” It will drive anybody crazy. But the answers are tremendously beautiful.\nThis moment is the answer, whatever it is. There is no other answer. The facticity of this moment is the answer. Truth is herenow, but the ego is never satisfied with the truth that is herenow. The ego wants something difficult, it thrives on difficulties. The ego lives through great challenges. If life is only a cup of tea, where will your ego find the ground to stand on? If life is only the cypress tree in the courtyard, how will you become a great saint, a mahatma? There is no possibility left – the ego will have to disappear. If truth is so simple and obvious, then the ego cannot be nourished. There is nothing left to be nourished on.\nWhen the Master said, “Life is a river,” he simply took away the very earth underneath the man. He must have wanted something of tremendous import, a revelation, God descending from heaven, great light, infinite light happening, a vision, something utterly extraordinary.\n“Life is a river”? – such an ordinary statement? But if you meditate over it you will find God descending from heaven, great light, infinite light coming to your vision, psychedelic, colorful, spiritual experiences. All are just childish. All are toys for the ego to play with.\nReal religion consists of the obvious. The obvious, the ordinary, is the mysterious. The obvious, that which is always with you, has always been with you, will always be with you, is God. Between you and God there is no distance at all. Not even a single step is needed to be taken.\nIf you understand it, you have understood all the religions, all the scriptures.\nBut the ego will create trouble. Ego is never interested in simple things because on simple things it cannot soar high. The more a thing is difficult, the better for the ego. That’s why religions became interested in unnecessary difficulties. They are called austerities, asceticism; they are nothing but food for the ego. They have not helped anybody to know the truth. In fact they have been the greatest barriers.\nReligion became a pathology, religion went neurotic, because of the demands of the ego. The ego wants something utterly difficult so that it becomes a special privilege if you attain it – only you have attained it, nobody else. It wants truth to be something like the peak of Everest or walking on the moon; something so special that you can claim. Through it, you become special.\nBecause of this, religion slowly slowly became sado-masochistic. “Torture yourself” – the more you torture, the more religious you are. And when a person tortures himself, teaches others also to torture themselves, out of necessity he becomes doubly pathological. He tortures himself, so he is a masochist, and because he teaches others to torture themselves he becomes a sadist.\nIn the name of religion, sado-masochism has existed on the earth. That’s why only neurotic people become interested in religion. The healthy person avoids it.\nThe religion I am teaching you is for the healthy person. It is for those who are not in search of fulfilling their egos. It is for those who are ready to be ordinary, utterly ordinary. It is for those who are ready to dissolve in the obvious. It is for those who are ready to make their home in this\nmoment, this beautiful now, and who are not hankering for any paradise, who are not hankering at all; who have no desires for the other world and no desires for some god sitting on a golden throne somewhere; but for those whose god is spread all over existence, in the calls of the birds and in the green leaves of the trees and in the dewdrops and in the sunrays and in you and in me – all over; whose god is not something separate from life and existence; whose god can be in a cup of tea, whose god can be the river flowing by, whose god can be the cypress tree in the courtyard, and whose god can be three pounds of flax. It is not sacrilegious. It is not that God is reduced, Buddha is reduced, to three pounds of flax; on the contrary, three pounds of flax is transformed into divinity, into Buddhahood, into God. It is not sacrilegious, it is one of the most sacred statements ever made.\nThis is one of the basic truths to be understood. Then it will be very easy to go into this beautiful parable.\nTHERE WAS ONCE A WOMAN WHO HAD HEARD OF THE FRUIT OF HEAVEN. SHE COVETED IT.\nMeditate over each word:\nTHERE WAS ONCE A WOMAN WHO HAD HEARD...\nMany of the people who become religious, become religious only through information. That’s where they miss the whole point; their first step has fallen on the wrong track.\nIf your life makes you religious, then it is totally different. If your very experience of life creates enquiry in you about truth, that has beauty in it. But just because you have heard – people are talking about God and paradise and nirvana and enlightenment – and because of their talk and constant propaganda down the centuries, and millions of books and scriptures, and churches and temples and gurudwaras and mosques, and everywhere it is being taught, from the very childhood you are being conditioned that there is a God, that there is a paradise, that you have to search for it.If you become interested in the search because of these conditionings, your search is doomed\nfrom the very beginning. You have already moved in a wrong direction. It is not your search, it is borrowed. It is not an authentic desire in your heart, it is just in your head. It is accidental; it is because you have been told. If you were not told you would not have bothered at all. And you can see it.\nWhen a Jaina comes to me, he never asks how to find God, because in his scriptures there is no belief about God. He asks how to attain to moksha, to ultimate freedom, liberation. God is not meaningful to him at all, because he has not been taught about God. Not that he knows there is no God, but because his mind has been conditioned in a certain way, he has given another word with totally different connotations. He has been taught that y our soul is in a bondage in the world and you have to drop the bondage and attain to ultimate freedom. Unless you attain to ultimate freedom – when all bondages of attachment, possessiveness, domination, have disappeared, when there is no greed, no anger, no sex, when there is nobody left and you are a pure soul.then you have\narrived. This is the goal, moksha. He asked about moksha.\nBut no Christian ever asks me about moksha, freedom. He has not been told. He asks how, by what means, one can enter into the kingdom of God. He never asks how to become God, because he\nhas not been told. On the contrary, he has been told nobody can become God. God is God and you are you, God is the creator and you are the creature – and how can the creature be the creator? So even the idea of becoming God will look sacrilegious, a sin, a great sin. He will never ask how to become a God, how to realize God. No! All that he wants is how to enter into the kingdom of God, that’s all.\nBut when a Vedantin comes to me, then his enquiry is totally different. He says, “How to become God? How to become absolute truth?” He does not ask about the kingdom of God. He has been told tat tvam asi, that art thou. You are in your very essence God, so attain to your Godhood. Aham brahmasmi – I am God – that has been poured into him with the mother’s milk. He has become saturated with the idea. He asks, how to become God? From where are these different enquiries coming?\nAnd when a Buddhist comes he never asks how to become a God, because there is no God in his theology. His theology is without any concept of God. In fact, to call it theology is not right, because there is no theos, no God. He does not believe in any soul, so he will never ask how to realize one’s own being – there is none. Self-realization is utter nonsense for him. Because he does not believe in the soul there is no question of attaining liberation; there is nobody to be liberated. Then what is his enquiry?\nHe asks about nirvana. Nirvana means to extinguish this illusory flame of life. His enquiry is very negative; he simply asks how not to be. There is no question of being a soul, no question of being a God, no question of God’s kingdom. His enquiry is very negative. He asks how not to be, how to be extinguished utterly, how to become utter emptiness, how to disappear into emptiness so nothing is left.\nThe Jaina asks how to make one’s own self free, and the Buddhist asks how to be free of one’s own self. But these different enquiries are all accidental, borrowed. Even your questions are borrowed, your queries are borrowed. Even your enquiry is not yours. It is not true, and when you begin with an untrue enquiry you will never come to a true conclusion.\nThat is one of the greatest problems every seeker has to face. Don’t start with what you have heard, start with what you have felt. Can’t you feel the beauty of existence and the mystery of existence? Can’t you feel this utter poetry of existence? Have you to go into the Vedas to feel the poetry of existence? Have you to go into the Bible? Have you to ask Buddha, Christ, Krishna? Can’t you yourself see? Don’t you have eyes to see and ears to hear and a heart to feel? Then what are you doing here? What are you? Are you alive or not?\nAn alive person is one who will look at life, who will witness life; who will not only witness life but will witness the witness itself. And then there arises a great enquiry – “What is all this?” It is not borrowed, it is not heard from somebody else. It arises from the deepest core of your being just like a sprout arising out of a seed. Then the enquiry is not plastic; it is a real rose. And only a real rose can have a real fragrance.\nTHERE WAS ONCE A WOMAN WHO HAD HEARD OF THE FRUIT OF HEAVEN.…\nShe had just heard; and when you hear you are bound to misunderstand.\nNow, the “Fruit of Heaven” is just a metaphor. It is just a way of saying it, a poetic way of saying it. The ultimate truth cannot be expressed in words. No word is adequate to express it. Hence metaphors have to be used, similes have to be used, just to give you a little indication, a little taste. It is difficult to show you the truth directly, so some indirect ways and means have to be devised. Parables have to be told, stories, because stories don’t say anything directly, they only give you subtle hints, delicate hints.\nThe Fruit of Heaven – what does it mean? If you have heard it from somebody it simply means “fruit of heaven”. Then you start thinking of some fruit. It is not a fruit, it is fruitfulness. The fruit only represents a state of fruitfulness. The fruit represents three F’s: one is fruitfulness, another is flowering, another is fragrance. And when all these three F’s exist together – the fruit, the flower, and the fragrance – the fourth F comes into existence. That is fulfillment. That is the real goal.\nNow if you try to decipher, to decode the symbol of the Fruit of Heaven, how are you going to work, how will you decode it? The Christian will think it means Kingdom of God, and the Brahmin will think it means God-realization, and the Jaina will think it means freedom of the self, and the Buddhist will think it means freedom from the self. Again you have fallen into the trap of the herd.\nBe a little more intelligent. Be a little more trusting of your own being. Decode these beautiful metaphors on your own; meditate on them.\nThat’s why I am speaking on these stories. Nobody has ever spoken on them. Why am I speaking on these small stories? – just to give you a few clues on how to meditate. These are not commentaries on these stories; I am not a commentator. I am simply helping you to meditate. I don’t want to give you a very fixed meaning, I simply want to give you a very liquid, vague, cloudy glimpse. Then you have to search and seek and find. The conclusion has to be yours. I can give you a few clues on how to meditate. That’s all that I am doing here... just clues on how to meditate, not conclusions! Don’t lean upon me. I am not going to give you a single conclusion, because once a conclusion is given by somebody else it loses all truth, it becomes a falsehood. It may be true for me, but the moment I give it to you it becomes false. In the very transfer it loses all truth. To me it was a real rose; by the time it reaches you it is a plastic flower.\nThis is the problem of language, the great problem that has always been faced by all the mystics of all the ages of all the lands. Language is good enough to convey mundane reality: it is utterly impotent in conveying the sacred reality.\nBut some ways have to be found, because it has to be conveyed. A parable, a story, is a subtle way, a delicate way, an indirect way. The story does not hit, it simply triggers a process in you. It is not like a stone that hits you hard. It is like the fragrance of a flower that comes and surrounds you and caresses you.\nTHERE WAS ONCE A WOMAN WHO HAD HEARD OF THE FRUIT OF HEAVEN. SHE COVETED IT.\nThe moment you believe in somebody else’s truth, you start coveting it. And truth cannot be coveted. And the person who covets truth will never attain to it.\nTruth is not a commodity to be coveted. Truth is not a thing to be desired and longed for. Truth is not there outside you to be possessed. Truth is something that flowers in you; you don’t take it from anybody. And if you attain to truth, it is not like money that somebody else has lost because you have it. It is not a quantity in the world, it is a quality of being.\nWhen Buddha becomes enlightened it is not that somebody else is suffering: Buddha has usurped enlightenment, now somebody must be poor and will not be able to attain enlightenment. If somebody becomes rich, naturally somebody else somewhere will become poor. That’s not the case with truth. It is not a quantity – remember it – it is a quality.\nIf I see the beauty of the moon, it does not mean that I have taken some beauty of the moon and nobody else will be able to see the beauty now, because I have possessed it. It is a quality! Millions of people can see the beauty. There is no question of competition, there is no quarrel. On the contrary, the more people see the beauty of the moon, the more beautiful it becomes.\nIn fact, this has been one of the greatest observations of poets, painters, and the people who move in the dimension of aesthetics: that when a poet writes a poem about the moon he reveals some beauty of the moon which was not available before. And many more people will be able to see it now; their sensitivity will be aroused.\nYou have seen the sun rising, but if you have seen the paintings of Vincent Van Gogh of the sun rising, the sun in the middle of the day, the sun setting, you will be surprised: he has a totally different way of looking at the sun. He was so madly in love with the sun as nobody has ever been. For one year continuously he was painting the sun and the sun and the sun, and he was standing continuously under the sun for one year. It was so hot, but he wanted to catch the sun in all its moods. He caught the sun in all its moods, in all its whims, in all its expressions, but he himself went mad. One year just standing under the sun, looking at the sun – the heat was too much, he could not bear it. His love for the sun was such that he went mad for it.\nIf you see Van Gogh’s paintings of the sun you will become, for the first time, aware of the beauty of the sun. When you will look at the sun, something of Van Gogh’s vision will have penetrated your soul.\nNature is more beautiful because there have been nature poets. Nature is more beautiful because there have been nature painters. Nature is more beautiful because many, many people have seen beauty in it and that has become a heritage that has penetrated our beings.\nTruth is not like money, truth is like beauty. The more people see it, the more clear it is. The more people have it, the more people can have it. There is no question of coveting.\nBut the woman had only heard, the woman had only gathered rumors about the Fruit of Heaven. Now she must be feeling very miserable, in despair: “Others have attained and I have not attained. I have to show to the world, I have to prove myself.”\nThis is an ego trip, this is not true search; this is the same ego trip. Some people are trying to collect more and more money so they can stand on the pile of money and declare to the world, “Nobody has more than I have.” Somebody else is moving into the world of power-politics so he can become\nthe president of a country and declare, “Look! I have arrived.” And then there are others who are thinking that when they have attained to the Fruit of Heaven they will show the world: “Now do you know who I am? I am a Realized Person. I have Attained and you are all Ignorant, and you are all Sinners and you are all still crawling in the mud of the world. I have gone beyond it.” Then one can have that look which is known as “holier-than-thou”.\nThis woman coveted it. If you hear about truth, God, enlightenment, there arises a great desire: “Others are having something which I am not having. I must have it.”\nIt is just like somebody else having a beautiful house, and you covet it; somebody else has a beautiful wife, and you covet. Is truth a beautiful house? Is truth a beautiful woman?\nTruth is not a thing, truth is a no-thing. Truth is not a commodity there outside you, it is an experience, it is in your interiority. It is felt, lived at the very core of your being. It cannot be possessed, it cannot be coveted – but that’s how it goes on.\nJust the other day somebody has asked, “If I can convince him, he will become a sannyasin. If I can convince him that by wearing orange and the mala he will attain to bliss”... Now this is greed, and a greedy person cannot be a sannyasin. And it is not a question of my convincing you; you will have to convince me that you are worth being initiated into sannyas. You will have to convince me that you have not come to enquire just because others are talking about God, but that a great inner desire has arisen in you, a longing, a thirst, that you are aflame, that a passion has arisen in you that “Life is useless if I don’t know who I am, if I don’t know from where I come and if I don’t know to where I am going. I have to know it, because without knowing it, whatsoever I am doing is foolish, is going to be stupid. Without knowing who I am whatsoever I do is meaningless. Meaning can arise only when I know my nature and start moving according to my nature. When there is a harmony of me and the existence that surrounds me, only then can there be joy and bliss.”\nBliss is not something to be desired, bliss is not something to be coveted.\nBut the person who had asked must have come here hearing others saying that if you become a sannyasin you will attain to God, to bliss. Now he wants me to convince him.\nI am not a salesman! I am not selling God to you! Why should I convince you? If you are thirsty you will come to the river. The river does not bother, the river is not in any need of convincing you, that “I am water and I can quench your thirst.” If you are thirsty you will try. You will have to try; there is no other way.\nBut the problem always arises because we hear others, we don’t feel any passion arising in our own being. Our passion is borrowed, superficial. And a man, who has no passion for truth of his own is not yet man. He is still part of the animal world, he is still living unconsciously. At least something – just even a small thirst will do – but you will have to bring a thirst of your own.\nI have heard...\nA tramp knocked at a cottage door, and when it was opened he said to the housewife, “Beg pardon mum, but I wonder if you would not sew a button on a coat for me.”\n“Why yes, my man,” said the woman, a kindly soul. “Come in.” The tramp entered and handed the woman a button.\n“Very well,” she said, “now where is the coat?”\n“Ah, I ain’t got nothing but the button, mum. I was thinking maybe you would sew the coat on.”\nBut people who start searching for God don’t even have the button. I am ready to supply the coat, but at least bring the button! At least a little thirst of your own, your own heart beating a little faster, a readiness to risk, a readiness to devote something, to dedicate, a readiness to sacrifice something... a readiness to risk.…\nSHE ASKED A CERTAIN DERVISH, WHOM WE SHALL CALL SABAR, “HOW CAN I FIND THIS FRUIT, SO THAT I MAY ATTAIN TO IMMEDIATE KNOWLEDGE?”\nSabr or Sabar is a significant word: it means patience.\nSHE ASKED A CERTAIN DERVISH, WHOM WE SHALL CALL SABAR, “HOW CAN I FIND THIS FRUIT, SO THAT I MAY ATTAIN TO IMMEDIATE KNOWLEDGE?”\nThese parables are pieces of objective art. Each word has significance, and each word has to be meditated upon. Why should we call this dervish Sabar? That is not his name, certainly. That’s why the story says, “We shall call him Sabar.”\nSabar comes from sabr: it means infinite patience. Those who are in search will need infinite patience. Patience is the greatest religious quality; if you have patience nothing else is needed. Patience is enough, enough unto itself. Patience means hope, trust, and without any hurry, without any impatience. Impatience simply shows that you are not trustful. Impatience simply shows that you want to impose yourself upon the will of God, that you want it right now. You don’t want him to work on his own. Impatience means, “My will is greater than your will.” Patience means, “I surrender my will to your will. Let you be my will, so whenever I am ripe, whenever – if it takes an eternity it is okay – I will trust, I will hope. I will not lose my heart, I will not be disheartened.”\nJust think of patience... it will bring a meditation on its own. The man of patience becomes meditative because he becomes contented. He says, “God is looking after me so why should I worry?”\nThe more God has disappeared from the world, the more worries have entered into the world. You can watch it; there is a certain relationship. When people are in trust, in faith, when people know that God is, that we are taken care of, that we are not strangers on this earth, that we belong, that there is some invisible hand that is always ready to take us in the right direction, that we can live without worry, contentment arises, peace, silence, tranquility, a serenity.\nAll is lost now because trust in God is lost. The moment man loses God, he loses all – because then he has to depend only on himself, and he is tiny, and the existence is vast. Man is just an atom and the atom is trying to struggle with this infinite existence. There is bound to be tension, anguish, despair, frustration, worry, suicide, madness.\nThe religious person is one who is relaxed with existence, who does not push the river; on the contrary, who dissolves into the river and says to the river, “Take me wherever you are going, because wherever you are going is the goal.” The religious person, the person who is patient, is one who says, “I will not seek and search a goal of my own, I don’t have a private goal to seek and search. Wherever this infinite universe is going I am also going.” So whatsoever is the destiny of the whole is the destiny of the part. This is patience, this is sabr.\nSHE ASKED A CERTAIN DERVISH, WHOM WE SHALL CALL SABAR, “HOW CAN I FIND THIS FRUIT?...”\nNow she is asking a wrong question. She says, “How can I find this fruit?”\nRemember Lao Tzu’s famous statement: “Seek and you will never find; do not seek and it is already found.” In seeking you go astray, because seeking means “my will”, non-seeking means let-go, disappearance of the ego. And whenever you are not, God is. Lao Tzu is right: seek and you will miss; do not seek and find.\nNon-seeking is the way to find. It will look very strange, illogical, but this is how it is. This existence is illogical; that’s why we call it a mystery. If it were logical there would be no mystery. If the existence were logical then there would be no need for religion, science would have been enough. Science would have discovered everything if the existence were logical. But it is not; fortunately, it is not. Logic only goes to a certain extent, and then it flops. And when logic flops the real existence begins.\nExistence is a mystery. The way to it is not logic but love. The way to it is not prose but poetry. The way to it is not the head but the heart.\nNow this woman says, “How can I find this fruit?” The question of “how” is the question of the head, and the idea of finding this fruit is egoistic: “I must possess.” It is the desire to possess and conquer and be, “so that I may attain to immediate knowledge.” Now the whole desire is how to attain the fruit so immediate knowledge is possible.\nPeople are in a hurry – they want instant God, just like instant coffee. They cannot wait. And when you cannot wait you simply say that you don’t care much. If you care you can wait; the more you care the more you can wait. If you really care you can wait for eternity. If you don’t care then you are in a hurry. You say, “If it is possible right now, instantly, okay; otherwise I am not going to waste time, it is not worth wasting time.”\nAnd God is not a seasonal flower, it is a cedar of Lebanon – it takes time to grow. To reach to the clouds, it takes time. In fact time is not enough, it takes eternity. Time falls short.\nAnd I am not saying that God is not available now. Another paradox to be understood: eternity is always now. The now is the door to eternity. But that door is available only to the patient one, because those who are in a hurry and say, “Instantly I want this,” their very hurry creates such cloud and clamor in their minds; they cannot see the now. To see the now one needs a very unclouded consciousness. And the consciousness is unclouded only when there is no desire, no hurry, no impatience, no longing. The consciousness is unclouded only when you are not going anywhere. Just sitting silently, doing nothing, the spring comes and the grass grows by itself. That is patience.\n“YOU SHOULD BE BEST ADVISED TO STUDY WITH ME,” SAID THE DERVISH. “BUT IF YOU WILL NOT DO SO, YOU WILL HAVE TO TRAVEL RESOLUTELY AND AT TIMES RESTLESSLY THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.”\nThat’s what anybody who knows will say: “You would be best advised to study with me.” What does he mean?\nThe word “study” has not that quality that Sabar must have used.\nIn India we have a word, swasthya. It can be translated as study, but it misses the whole point. In fact, swasthya means self-study, studying the self. It is not a question of reading scriptures, it is not a question of going more and more into information. Rather it is a question of going more and more inwards, into transformation.\nAnd when Sufis say, “Study with us,” they simply mean “Be with us.” Being with a Master is the study; just being with the Master, adab, just being in the presence of the one who knows, drinking his presence, savoring his being, tasting him, digesting his energy. You will be surprised: if you come to a Sufi study circle, it has nothing to do with the study circles that exist in the West. In a Western study circle you read a book, then questions are raised and then questions answered, and discussion follows.\nIn a Sufi study group no question is raised, no book is read. People sit silently for hours, and maybe somebody starts swaying. But the one thing to be remembered is: nobody has to do anything. If it happens it is good. Somebody sometimes starts saying something, but the rule has to be followed: nobody should try to say anything. If it happens on its own, if one finds that something needs to be said, on its own is ready to be said, is just on the tongue, wants to come out “in spite of me”, then it’s okay.\nIt is just like the Quaker prayer meeting. Quakers learned it from the Sufis. In the Middle Ages Sufis penetrated deep into European countries. Quakers learned how to sit silently from the Sufis. The Quakers sit silently for hours, then somebody may stand up and may start saying something; but those statements are very inspired. They are not from the person himself – as if God has taken possession of him. He has become just a hollow bamboo, a flute, and some unknown energy has started singing through him.\nThe rule has to be followed. But in a Quaker group it is very difficult to follow the rule, because the basic thing is missing – the Master is missing.\nIn a Sufi group the Master is a must. The Sufi group arises only when the center is there. The Quaker group is just a traditional thing.They learned it from Sufis but they missed one thing. They learned the outward, adab, the etiquette, how to sit in silence – and it is good even if without a Master; sitting in silence is good – but the mind is very cunning. Your mind may play tricks; your mind may like to say something, your mind may enjoy the idea that “Now I am the vehicle of God.” And it is not that you are trying to deceive others; your mind can deceive you and you may stand up, and you will feel as if you are not doing anything. But there is no check in a Quaker group.\nWhen you are with a Sufi Master there is a check. He will immediately stop you; he will know when it is from your mind. Maybe it is from your unconscious mind but it is still from your mind. You may\nnot be aware of from where it is coming; that does not mean that it is coming from God. It may be coming from your own deep unconscious of which you are not aware, so it looks as if it is coming from God. A Master is needed, one who can see through and through, who is a mirror not only of your conscious mind but of your unconscious too, before whom you are utterly naked, before whom you cannot hide a thing. His very presence prevents all strategies of the mind.\nThat is the meaning of being with a Master, adab. That’s what Sabar means when he says, “You would be best advised to study with me, be with me, learn to be here. Just watch what is happening here.”\nBut the woman was in a hurry. Study? She had not come to study. She wanted to know immediately where the tree was, where was that garden, and where was the Fruit of Heaven. She was not there to waste her time in studying some nonsense. She wanted immediate results, she was in a hurry. Sabar must have immediately felt it. So first he said, “You would be best advised to study with me, but if you will not do so...” He must have seen the mind of the woman – that she was not going to do it. She was too much in a hurry; she could not be in the presence of a Master.\n“YOU WILL HAVE TO TRAVEL RESOLUTELY AND AT TIMES RESTLESSLY THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.”\nThen you can go, but one thing I must remind you of. Remember, you will have to go throughout the world, resolutely and at times very restlessly. The journey will be long. If you want it in such a hurry then the journey will be very long. If you are ready to wait, the journey can be very short. If you can wait infinitely it can happen right now too, but if you cannot wait then it may take years or even lives. It is up to you.\nThe woman missed. The people who are in a hurry always go on missing the Masters, because the basic requirement to be with a Master is patience, and they are impatient. She must have thought, “It is better to go to somebody else who can show me a shortcut.”\nSHE LEFT HIM AND SOUGHT ANOTHER, ARIF THE WISE ONE.\nNow, arif means the knowledgeable. If you go to a real Master, a perfect Master, he will demand many things from you. He will demand utter surrender, just as Krishna says to his disciple Arjuna: Sarva dharma parityajya mamekam sharnam braja – “Leave all your religions et cetera, and come to my feet, surrender.”\nThe real Master will demand, and the greater the disciple, the greater the demand is going to be, the more the potential, the more the demand is going to be. The real Master is not there just to inform you, he is there to transform you. But who wants to be transformed? People want something without paying for it.\nThat’s why the woman went to Arif. “Arif” means the knowledgeable one. He is not a Master, he is a teacher. Teachers are many, Masters very rare and very few. That’s why Sabar said, “You will have to go around the whole earth, you will have to travel the whole world. Then too, if you can find the Master again, it will be a rare fortune.”\nYou will meet many teachers; they exist everywhere. And they have great appeal too, because they never demand. On the contrary, they supply, they give you information, they make you more knowledgeable. “Arif” means one who is very knowledgeable, a learned man who knows the scriptures, knows doctrines, dogmas, can explain difficult problems of theology, can go into subtleties, into very deep, logical complexities of systems. But information can never satisfy. It is as futile as informing a hungry person about bread: it is about and about, the bread is never supplied. Great talk about the bread, but how can bread, just by being talked about, be satisfying? The talk of the lamp will not create light.\nSo soon the woman must have become frustrated. She must have gathered a great knowledge, but she must have become frustrated. She moved.\nThat’s how people go on moving from one teacher to another teacher. Even if they come across a Master, there is every possibility of missing the Master – because they come with expectations. And no Master ever fulfills anybody’s expectations; that is an absolute criterion. If somebody fulfills your expectations he is a teacher. In fact he is a follower of yours – he is fulfilling your expectations. The real Master never fulfills your expectations. On the contrary, he goes on destroying your expectations. Whatsoever you expect, he will never do; he will just do the contrary. Why? – because if he fulfills your expectations he will never be abIe to change you.\nYou have to be changed, utterly changed. You have to be burnt, in toto. Your expectations come from your mind; your mind has to be destroyed. Only then and only then is God possible. So how can a real Master fulfill your expectations?\nPeople go on changing from one teacher to another. A few days they are on a honeymoon with one teacher, and then as every honeymoon fades away, after a few days they are finished. When they first come across a teacher they are very enchanted; it seems as if now the time has come for fulfillment of their desire. But soon knowledge is supplied, and knowledge cannot quench your thirst.\nThe woman must have felt frustrated, so she went to another, Hakim the Sage. “Hakim” means the man who has character, “arif” means the man who has knowledge. Now she is finished with knowledge. She has seen a learned scholar but what is that to do? Now she wants some man who is not only knowledgeable, but who has practised, who has something in his character to say that he knows.\nSo she must have gone to another, Hakim the Sage. Now the man of character has more appeal than the man of knowledge, because the man of knowledge lives in an intellectual world which very few can understand, but the man of character is very earthly, you can understand him. He eats only once a day, he lives in poverty – it is so visible – he is a celibate. Any stupid person can see. No intelligence is needed, no intelligence is at all required, so foolish people become very much attracted to character. And the people who create character around themselves are also mediocre, because by creating a character nothing is changed, never. Only your surface is painted in a better way, your inner reality remains the same.\nBut it has-great influence on people. They can see, “Yes, this man is not only a learned man, this is a man of God. Look how he lives, with what simplicity, with what humbleness, how egoless he is.” It is so plain on the surface; anybody can see.\nSo she went to the teacher, Hakim, the man of character. But sooner or later you will see the hypocrisy. If you live long enough with the man of character you will see the duality, that there are moments when his real being surfaces, there are moments when he cannot manage his so-called character. If you live long enough and if you watch the man of character you will be able to see the contradictions of his life, the hypocrisy. He is not one, he is many – or at least two. One is his real essence which comes once in a while at certain moments, through certain provocations. He may be a man of very great compassion if everything goes according to him. If something goes against him, anger may surface. For that anger you will have to be with such a man for a long time, because once in a while he will flare up. He may have repressed his sex, may have become celibate, but once in a while the repressed desire may come to the conscious mind – he may behave contradicting his character. Because the duality has not been dissolved, it is bound to assert – so she must have been tired, seeing the hypocrisy.\nShe went to Majzub the Mad. “Majzub” means the mad. In a way she was coming closer. First she went to the man of knowledge, Arif, which is very superficial. Then she went to the man of character, which is a little bit more practical, not just heady. He had tried to do something with his life, even if he was wrong; but his sincerity could not be suspected. He may have been full of errors but he was sincere. He had tried to do – in a stupid way of course – but he had tried to do.\nNow she went to a madman, Majzub. “Majzub” means one who is utterly drowned in God, lost, has attained the state of fana, is no more. She had come to the best man.\nBut there is a problem with a majzub: he cannot be a Master. He is so mad, he cannot help. He is utterly lost, he is not in any way capable of helping. In fact, he himself needs the help of an enlightened person so that some sanity can be brought back to him.\nThis kind of work has rarely been done in the world, but one of the greatest Masters of this age, Meher Baba, did it. He was also here in Poona, and the Poona people were as much against him as they are against me, for the same reasons – because he would not fulfill their expectations. He was a man of God. He did something so tremendously valuable that it is rarely done, but no history books will ever mention it because histories are written by fools about other fools. Histories are written by people who don’t know anything about the deeper phenomenon that goes on happening. Histories are written about politicians, stupid politicians, Adolf Hitler and so many books.…\nIf you want to see all the books about Adolf Hitler, you can go to Samarpan’s room. He has them all, he is the expert; so many books. And people go on writing as if there is something important. Can’t you forget these stupid, neurotic people? Is there any need to keep their memory alive forever? It will be very good to drop them out of history. They are wounds! But flowers are not talked about, only wounds.\nMeher Baba is not part of history. Nobody has tried to see the great experiment that he did. He travelled all over the country to catch hold of all kinds of majzubs, madmen, because they are just very close to God. Only one thing is needed: somebody is needed who can shake them back to their sanity. Then they can become great Masters. Just a little sanity will be needed; then their madness will have a method in it. Right now they are only mad without any method; they cannot help. And to follow them may be dangerous, hazardous. To follow them, you will be only following yourself because they will never give you any clue. And whatsoever they will say, if you follow it,\ncan lead you astray. It can throw you into deep pitfalls, because they are not in their consciousness; they have drowned themselves in God so much that they are drunk, they are drunkards. They have known God but they have no way to relate it to you. They cannot be Masters.\nEach Master becomes a majzub before he becomes a Master – he goes through great madness – but all majzubs are not Masters. If a majzub dies as a majzub, he will attain to God but without helping anybody at all.\nNow she had come to a right person, but the person was not a Master and could not be a Master. He could not supply any method.\nSo she started moving again to somebody who could supply a method. So she went to the fourth, Alim. “Alim” means the scientist, the methodologist, one who can give you the methods. She has again moved far away, because it is not necessary that the person who can give you the method knows what he is doing, because methods can be gathered from scriptures. You can read Patanjali’s YOGA SUTRAS and you can start giving methods to others; that is not going to help.\nA majzub cannot give methods. And the person who gives methods, if he has not been a majzub, is of no use. The majzub cannot be followed – it is dangerous, because you will be following a madman – and you cannot follow Alim, the scientist, because he himself does not know anything. He has gathered about methods, he is interested, he is a collector of methods.\nThere are many people who go on writing commentaries on the YOGA SUTRAS of Patanjali, and they have never meditated, they have never known what meditation is. But they know all about meditation. Many times they have come to me; they have written beautiful commentaries, they are very knowledgeable, learned, scholarly. You cannot find any fault with their language, with their exposition, but there is no experience to support what they are saying. There is not much difference between them and the ignorant people.\n... AND MANY MORE. She went to many more.\nSHE PASSED THIRTY YEARS IN HER SEARCH. FINALLY SHE CAME TO A GARDEN.\nThe garden is again a symbol. The story of the world starts with the garden, the Garden of Eden, Adam and Eve, and life was eternally beautiful and blissful. The garden is the beginning of existence. And then Adam and Eve were thrown out, or threw themselves out, by eating the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge.\nThe moment you become knowledgeable you lose innocence. And innocence is the garden. In innocence, flowers bloom. In innocence, fragrance is released. In innocence, all is bliss. The garden is a symbol for innocence. And since Adam and Eve left the garden, man has been searching for the garden again and again.\nThe teqir, or the school of the Master, is called the garden of the Master – because with a Master you start vomiting the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge. The Master is nothing but a process of taking out all the poison of knowledge from your system so that you can become innocent again. And when Adam is innocent, Adam becomes Christ. He enters the garden again – paradise lost, paradise regained.…\nAnd do you know what the word “paradise” means? It comes from a Sufi word fIRDHAUS. Firdhaus means a walled garden. That is from where the word “paradise” comes. Paradise is the garden. We have lost the garden somewhere in the past: we have to regain it. We have to be again as innocent as children and immediately we are back in the garden. In fact we have always been in the garden, but our eyes are so full of knowledge that we cannot see the garden. When the eyes are cleaned of knowledge and the dust of knowledge disappears from the mirror of consciousness, suddenly the whole garden explodes.\nSHE PASSED THIRTY YEARS IN HER SEARCH. FINALLY SHE CAME TO A GARDEN. THERE STOOD THE TREE OF HEAVEN, AND FROM ITS BRANCHES HUNG THE BRIGHT FRUIT OF HEAVEN.\nSTANDING BESIDE THE TREE WAS SABAR.…\nYou can imagine the shock the woman must have gone through. Sabar? And he was the first one she had come across.\nSTANDING BESIDE THE TREE WAS SABAR.…\nThat too is a beautiful metaphor: if you want to attain to the Fruit of Heaven, you will have to pass through the custodian, sabar, patience.\nPatience is the door back to the garden.\nThe First Dervish was standing by the side of the tree.”\nWHY DID YOU NOT TELL ME WHEN WE FIRST MET THAT YOU WERE THE CUSTODIAN OF THE FRUIT OF HEAVEN?” SHE ASKED HIM.\n“BECAUSE YOU WOULD NOT THEN HAVE BELIEVED ME.”\nA truth can be told only when you are ready for it. A truth can be given to you only when you are worthy of it. A truth can be transferred only when you have become a receptacle, not before it, not a single moment before it. When you are ripe, mature, ready, then not even a single moment passes by; Immediately... here you are ripe and there you are given the truth.\nThe Master cannot load you with something that is unnecessary. The unnecessary load will be heavy on you. It will be destructive, it may turn into poison, it will not nourish you. It may give you weight but it will not give you vitality.\n“BECAUSE YOU WOULD NOT THEN HAVE BELIEVED ME. BESIDES, THE TREE PRODUCES FRUIT ONLY ONCE IN THIRTY YEARS AND THIRTY DAYS.”\nEven if you had believed you would have had to wait. Even if you had believed, this time had to be passed in infinite patience; for that also you were not ready. So the best course was this: that I should allow you to go from one teacher to another, from one school to another school, and come back again when the time was ripe. You are ripe now, because you have seen through all the falsities.\nYou have been to Arif, the man of knowledge, and it was not enough. How can knowledge ever be enough? Knowledge is knowledge. To know about water is not going to quench your thirst.\nYou went to Hakim, the man of character, but the real man has no character. The real man lives moment to moment. The real man has consciousness but no conscience. The religious man knows nothing of morality; although he lives in morality he knows nothing of it. The real man has no character; he is characterless, although only he has character.\nWhat do I mean by this contradiction? He has no programed character, he does not live in a readymade way, he is not predictable. Each moment he responds in a fresh way. He is true, he is one, he is integrated, but these things are not imposed on him. He has not practised them. He has only worked for one thing: he has tried to become more and more conscious. Now out of his consciousness, each moment characters arise and disappear. But he does not carry the load of a structure around himself. He has no armor of the character. He is continuously free; he is freedom.\nYou went to Hakim, and then you knew that all character, imposed character, carries hypocrisy in it.\nThen you went to Majzub and he was a real man, but he was so mad that he could not teach you anything. Seeing that he could not teach you any method, you went to Alim, the methodologist, who knows everything about methods. But he had never done anything; it was not based in his own experience.\nAll this was needed, everything was good, and you have come back right in time, because “this Tree produces fruit only once in thirty years and thirty days.” Even if you had believed – which was impossible – you could not have understood. Even if I had said, “I am the custodian,” you may have thought, “This man is very egoistic – claiming himself to be the custodian?” That may have put you off. You could not have understood it, because you had come with the expectation that the man of knowing is humble.\nThe man of real understanding is neither arrogant nor humble. He simply is not, he only states the fact. It can hurt you, but that is your responsibility, that is your problem. He does not want to hurt you, ke has no desire to hurt anybody but his statements can hurt. And when they hurt, you will think they are being made in arrogance, in anger. They are not made in any anger or arrogance; be is simply stating a fact, as it is.\nSabar says: “BECAUSE YOU WOULD NOT THEN HAVE BELIEVED ME.”\nAnd it was better not to say anything that you could not believe. It was better for me to wait for you; and I have also been waiting. And I am Sabar, I can wait; that’s why I am the custodian. And you have come right in time. Now don’t feel worried and don’t think those thirty years have been a wastage. Nothing is a wastage. All those experiences – even going through false teachers, even going through unnecessary paths – have helped you. It has ripened you, it has made you mature. Now you are ready; I can deliver the fruit to you.”\nAnd that’s what is happening here: many come, only a few stay. Many come, but I cannot tell them that now there is no need to go anywhere, you have arrived home. I can tell that only to a few people, only to those who are ready to understand, who are ripe to understand. Otherwise I have to\ntell people to go, to search, to seek. Hopefully, after thirty years and thirty days, if I am here and you come back, you may be able to understand, and I may be able to give to you what i can give to you right now, but you will not take it.\nThe greatest thing in life is to be ready to take, to receive, to be feminine, to be a womb. And the real disciple is one who becomes feminine, who becomes a womb. When he is with the Master he is just receptive, passive. He drops all seeking, all searching, all hankering. He forgets all about truth, all about God and paradise and all that. He simply goes on allowing the Master to enter him; he becomes the host for the Master.\nAnd when you disappear completely and the Master has filled you completely, the Master also disappears. And in the disappearance of the disciple and the Master is paradise, the garden. You have come back home.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"10011","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_secret/part19/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_secret/>The Secret</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">19 Infinite Patience</h1><div class=post-meta>47 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;10011 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Secret/part19.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part18>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

RESTLESSLY THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.”</p><p><br></p><p>SHE LEFT HIM AND SOUGHT ANOTHER, ARIF THE WISE ONE, AND THEN SHE
FOUND HAKIM, THE SAGE, AND MAJZUB THE MAD, THEN ALIM THE SCIENTIST, AND
MANY MORE...</p><p><br></p><p>SHE PASSED THIRTY YEARS IN HER SEARCH. FINALLY SHE CAME TO A GARDEN.
THERE STOOD THE TREE OF HEAVEN, AND FROM ITS BRANCHES HUNG THE BRIGHT
FRUIT OF HEAVEN.</p><p><br></p><p>STANDING BESIDE THE TREE WAS SABAR, THE FIRST DERVISH.</p><p><br></p><p>“WHY DID YOU NOT TELL ME WHEN WE FIRST MET THAT YOU WERE THE
CUSTODIAN OF THE FRUIT OF HEAVEN?” SHE ASKED HIM.</p><p><br></p><p>“BECAUSE YOU WOULD NOT THEN HAVE BELIEVED ME. BESIDES, THE TREE
PRODUCES FRUIT ONLY ONCE IN THIRTY YEARS AND THIRTY DAYS.”</p><p>ONCE UPON A TIME THERE LIVED a very poor man in a village in Italy.
He desperately wanted to know the answer to the mystery of existence, so
he decided to work very hard and travel to the Himalayas and find a
guru. He worked long arduous hours and at the end of twenty years he had
saved his fare.</p><p><br></p><p>He had been on a ship for about two weeks when a tremendous storm
blew up and he was shipwrecked, and found himself on a desert island. He
spent the next twenty years on the island when one day he managed to
finally attract the attention of a tanker. They picked him up and took
him to Bombay where he caught a plane. He had managed to salvage some of
his money when shipwrecked.</p><p><br></p><p>However, during the flight he was hijacked by the hijackers. But the
hijackers decided to set him free in the desert. He walked to a village
and waited for the bus to take him to the Himalayas.</p><p><br></p><p>Within a few months the bus came and he caught it to the foothills of
the Himalayas. He then spent a long time on foot but finally managed to
arrive at the guru’s cave. He then asked the guru his question about the
mystery of life.</p><p><br></p><p>The guru replied, “Life is a river.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man went crazy, threw his arms up and shouted at the guru, “For
fifty years I have been trying to get to you. I had to work very hard
for the fare. I was shipwrecked and then hijacked, and bloody hell – now
you tell me life is a river?!”</p><p><br></p><p>And the guru said, “Isn’t it?”</p><p><br></p><p>Life is not a problem or a puzzle to be solved. Life is a mystery to
be loved and to be lived. And the mystery is not something far away, the
mystery is something that is very obvious, herenow. The mystery is the
this-ness of existence; hence the answer of the guru, “Life is a
river.”</p><p><br></p><p>He must have been sitting on the bank of the river watching the river
go by. In that moment his consciousness was full of the river, there was
nothing else but the river.</p><p><br></p><p>Another Master was asked, “What is truth?” and he said, “The cypress
tree in the courtyard.” He must have been looking at the beautiful
cypress in the courtyard; that was all in that moment. That moment was
full of the cypress tree, that moment was nothing but the cypress
tree.</p><p><br></p><p>And another Master when asked, “What is life?” was drinking tea. He
said, “A cup of tea.” This-ness, idam, or suchness, tathata – that’s
what life is.</p><p>Another, still another Master, was weighing flax, and he was asked,
“What is Buddha?” and he said, “Three pounds of flax.”</p><p><br></p><p>These answers are tremendously important. They don’t appear important
on the surface. It certainly can drive a person who has been working for
fifty years to reach to the Master crazy, who has wasted his whole life
to reach to the Master, to know the mystery of life – and the Master
says, “Life is a</p><p>river,” or “A cup of tea,” or “The cypress tree in the courtyard,” or
“Three pounds of flax.” It will drive anybody crazy. But the answers are
tremendously beautiful.</p><p><br></p><p>This moment is the answer, whatever it is. There is no other answer.
The facticity of this moment is the answer. Truth is herenow, but the
ego is never satisfied with the truth that is herenow. The ego wants
something difficult, it thrives on difficulties. The ego lives through
great challenges. If life is only a cup of tea, where will your ego find
the ground to stand on? If life is only the cypress tree in the
courtyard, how will you become a great saint, a mahatma? There is no
possibility left – the ego will have to disappear. If truth is so simple
and obvious, then the ego cannot be nourished. There is nothing left to
be nourished on.</p><p><br></p><p>When the Master said, “Life is a river,” he simply took away the very
earth underneath the man. He must have wanted something of tremendous
import, a revelation, God descending from heaven, great light, infinite
light happening, a vision, something utterly extraordinary.</p><p><br></p><p>“Life is a river”? – such an ordinary statement? But if you meditate
over it you will find God descending from heaven, great light, infinite
light coming to your vision, psychedelic, colorful, spiritual
experiences. All are just childish. All are toys for the ego to play
with.</p><p><br></p><p>Real religion consists of the obvious. The obvious, the ordinary, is
the mysterious. The obvious, that which is always with you, has always
been with you, will always be with you, is God. Between you and God
there is no distance at all. Not even a single step is needed to be
taken.</p><p><br></p><p>If you understand it, you have understood all the religions, all the
scriptures.</p><p><br></p><p>But the ego will create trouble. Ego is never interested in simple
things because on simple things it cannot soar high. The more a thing is
difficult, the better for the ego. That’s why religions became
interested in unnecessary difficulties. They are called austerities,
asceticism; they are nothing but food for the ego. They have not helped
anybody to know the truth. In fact they have been the greatest
barriers.</p><p><br></p><p>Religion became a pathology, religion went neurotic, because of the
demands of the ego. The ego wants something utterly difficult so that it
becomes a special privilege if you attain it – only you have attained
it, nobody else. It wants truth to be something like the peak of Everest
or walking on the moon; something so special that you can claim. Through
it, you become special.</p><p><br></p><p>Because of this, religion slowly slowly became sado-masochistic.
“Torture yourself” – the more you torture, the more religious you are.
And when a person tortures himself, teaches others also to torture
themselves, out of necessity he becomes doubly pathological. He tortures
himself, so he is a masochist, and because he teaches others to torture
themselves he becomes a sadist.</p><p><br></p><p>In the name of religion, sado-masochism has existed on the earth.
That’s why only neurotic people become interested in religion. The
healthy person avoids it.</p><p><br></p><p>The religion I am teaching you is for the healthy person. It is for
those who are not in search of fulfilling their egos. It is for those
who are ready to be ordinary, utterly ordinary. It is for those who are
ready to dissolve in the obvious. It is for those who are ready to make
their home in this</p><p>moment, this beautiful now, and who are not hankering for any
paradise, who are not hankering at all; who have no desires for the
other world and no desires for some god sitting on a golden throne
somewhere; but for those whose god is spread all over existence, in the
calls of the birds and in the green leaves of the trees and in the
dewdrops and in the sunrays and in you and in me – all over; whose god
is not something separate from life and existence; whose god can be in a
cup of tea, whose god can be the river flowing by, whose god can be the
cypress tree in the courtyard, and whose god can be three pounds of
flax. It is not sacrilegious. It is not that God is reduced, Buddha is
reduced, to three pounds of flax; on the contrary, three pounds of flax
is transformed into divinity, into Buddhahood, into God. It is not
sacrilegious, it is one of the most sacred statements ever made.</p><p><br></p><p>This is one of the basic truths to be understood. Then it will be
very easy to go into this beautiful parable.</p><p><br></p><p>THERE WAS ONCE A WOMAN WHO HAD HEARD OF THE FRUIT OF HEAVEN. SHE
COVETED IT.</p><p><br></p><p>Meditate over each word:</p><p><br></p><p>THERE WAS ONCE A WOMAN WHO HAD HEARD...</p><p><br></p><p>Many of the people who become religious, become religious only
through information. That’s where they miss the whole point; their first
step has fallen on the wrong track.</p><p><br></p><p>If your life makes you religious, then it is totally different. If
your very experience of life creates enquiry in you about truth, that
has beauty in it. But just because you have heard – people are talking
about God and paradise and nirvana and enlightenment – and because of
their talk and constant propaganda down the centuries, and millions of
books and scriptures, and churches and temples and gurudwaras and
mosques, and everywhere it is being taught, from the very childhood you
are being conditioned that there is a God, that there is a paradise,
that you have to search for it.<span class=s4></span>If you become
interested in the search because of these conditionings, your search is
doomed</p><p>from the very beginning. You have already moved in a wrong direction.
It is not your search, it is borrowed. It is not an authentic desire in
your heart, it is just in your head. It is accidental; it is because you
have been told. If you were not told you would not have bothered at all.
And you can see it.</p><p><br></p><p>When a Jaina comes to me, he never asks how to find God, because in
his scriptures there is no belief about God. He asks how to attain to
moksha, to ultimate freedom, liberation. God is not meaningful to him at
all, because he has not been taught about God. Not that he knows there
is no God, but because his mind has been conditioned in a certain way,
he has given another word with totally different connotations. He has
been taught that y our soul is in a bondage in the world and you have to
drop the bondage and attain to ultimate freedom. Unless you attain to
ultimate freedom – when all bondages of attachment, possessiveness,
domination, have disappeared, when there is no greed, no anger, no sex,
when there is nobody left and you are a pure soul.<span class=s4></span>then you have</p><p>arrived. This is the goal, moksha. He asked about moksha.</p><p><br></p><p>But no Christian ever asks me about moksha, freedom. He has not been
told. He asks how, by what means, one can enter into the kingdom of God.
He never asks how to become God, because he</p><p>has not been told. On the contrary, he has been told nobody can
become God. God is God and you are you, God is the creator and you are
the creature – and how can the creature be the creator? So even the idea
of becoming God will look sacrilegious, a sin, a great sin. He will
never ask how to become a God, how to realize God. No! All that he wants
is how to enter into the kingdom of God, that’s all.</p><p><br></p><p>But when a Vedantin comes to me, then his enquiry is totally
different. He says, “How to become God? How to become absolute truth?”
He does not ask about the kingdom of God. He has been told tat tvam asi,
that art thou. You are in your very essence God, so attain to your
Godhood. Aham brahmasmi – I am God – that has been poured into him with
the mother’s milk. He has become saturated with the idea. He asks, how
to become God? From where are these different enquiries coming?</p><p><br></p><p>And when a Buddhist comes he never asks how to become a God, because
there is no God in his theology. His theology is without any concept of
God. In fact, to call it theology is not right, because there is no
theos, no God. He does not believe in any soul, so he will never ask how
to realize one’s own being – there is none. Self-realization is utter
nonsense for him. Because he does not believe in the soul there is no
question of attaining liberation; there is nobody to be liberated. Then
what is his enquiry?</p><p><br></p><p>He asks about nirvana. Nirvana means to extinguish this illusory
flame of life. His enquiry is very negative; he simply asks how not to
be. There is no question of being a soul, no question of being a God, no
question of God’s kingdom. His enquiry is very negative. He asks how not
to be, how to be extinguished utterly, how to become utter emptiness,
how to disappear into emptiness so nothing is left.</p><p><br></p><p>The Jaina asks how to make one’s own self free, and the Buddhist asks
how to be free of one’s own self. But these different enquiries are all
accidental, borrowed. Even your questions are borrowed, your queries are
borrowed. Even your enquiry is not yours. It is not true, and when you
begin with an untrue enquiry you will never come to a true
conclusion.</p><p><br></p><p>That is one of the greatest problems every seeker has to face. Don’t
start with what you have heard, start with what you have felt. Can’t you
feel the beauty of existence and the mystery of existence? Can’t you
feel this utter poetry of existence? Have you to go into the Vedas to
feel the poetry of existence? Have you to go into the Bible? Have you to
ask Buddha, Christ, Krishna? Can’t you yourself see? Don’t you have eyes
to see and ears to hear and a heart to feel? Then what are you doing
here? What are you? Are you alive or not?</p><p><br></p><p>An alive person is one who will look at life, who will witness life;
who will not only witness life but will witness the witness itself. And
then there arises a great enquiry – “What is all this?” It is not
borrowed, it is not heard from somebody else. It arises from the deepest
core of your being just like a sprout arising out of a seed. Then the
enquiry is not plastic; it is a real rose. And only a real rose can have
a real fragrance.</p><p><br></p><p>THERE WAS ONCE A WOMAN WHO HAD HEARD OF THE FRUIT OF HEAVEN.…</p><p><br></p><p>She had just heard; and when you hear you are bound to
misunderstand.</p><p>Now, the “Fruit of Heaven” is just a metaphor. It is just a way of
saying it, a poetic way of saying it. The ultimate truth cannot be
expressed in words. No word is adequate to express it. Hence metaphors
have to be used, similes have to be used, just to give you a little
indication, a little taste. It is difficult to show you the truth
directly, so some indirect ways and means have to be devised. Parables
have to be told, stories, because stories don’t say anything directly,
they only give you subtle hints, delicate hints.</p><p><br></p><p>The Fruit of Heaven – what does it mean? If you have heard it from
somebody it simply means “fruit of heaven”. Then you start thinking of
some fruit. It is not a fruit, it is fruitfulness. The fruit only
represents a state of fruitfulness. The fruit represents three F’s: one
is fruitfulness, another is flowering, another is fragrance. And when
all these three F’s exist together – the fruit, the flower, and the
fragrance – the fourth F comes into existence. That is fulfillment. That
is the real goal.</p><p><br></p><p>Now if you try to decipher, to decode the symbol of the Fruit of
Heaven, how are you going to work, how will you decode it? The Christian
will think it means Kingdom of God, and the Brahmin will think it means
God-realization, and the Jaina will think it means freedom of the self,
and the Buddhist will think it means freedom from the self. Again you
have fallen into the trap of the herd.</p><p><br></p><p>Be a little more intelligent. Be a little more trusting of your own
being. Decode these beautiful metaphors on your own; meditate on
them.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why I am speaking on these stories. Nobody has ever spoken on
them. Why am I speaking on these small stories? – just to give you a few
clues on how to meditate. These are not commentaries on these stories; I
am not a commentator. I am simply helping you to meditate. I don’t want
to give you a very fixed meaning, I simply want to give you a very
liquid, vague, cloudy glimpse. Then you have to search and seek and
find. The conclusion has to be yours. I can give you a few clues on how
to meditate. That’s all that I am doing here... just clues on how to
meditate, not conclusions! Don’t lean upon me. I am not going to give
you a single conclusion, because once a conclusion is given by somebody
else it loses all truth, it becomes a falsehood. It may be true for me,
but the moment I give it to you it becomes false. In the very transfer
it loses all truth. To me it was a real rose; by the time it reaches you
it is a plastic flower.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the problem of language, the great problem that has always
been faced by all the mystics of all the ages of all the lands. Language
is good enough to convey mundane reality: it is utterly impotent in
conveying the sacred reality.</p><p><br></p><p>But some ways have to be found, because it has to be conveyed. A
parable, a story, is a subtle way, a delicate way, an indirect way. The
story does not hit, it simply triggers a process in you. It is not like
a stone that hits you hard. It is like the fragrance of a flower that
comes and surrounds you and caresses you.</p><p><br></p><p>THERE WAS ONCE A WOMAN WHO HAD HEARD OF THE FRUIT OF HEAVEN. SHE
COVETED IT.</p><p><br></p><p>The moment you believe in somebody else’s truth, you start coveting
it. And truth cannot be coveted. And the person who covets truth will
never attain to it.</p><p>Truth is not a commodity to be coveted. Truth is not a thing to be
desired and longed for. Truth is not there outside you to be possessed.
Truth is something that flowers in you; you don’t take it from anybody.
And if you attain to truth, it is not like money that somebody else has
lost because you have it. It is not a quantity in the world, it is a
quality of being.</p><p><br></p><p>When Buddha becomes enlightened it is not that somebody else is
suffering: Buddha has usurped enlightenment, now somebody must be poor
and will not be able to attain enlightenment. If somebody becomes rich,
naturally somebody else somewhere will become poor. That’s not the case
with truth. It is not a quantity – remember it – it is a quality.</p><p><br></p><p>If I see the beauty of the moon, it does not mean that I have taken
some beauty of the moon and nobody else will be able to see the beauty
now, because I have possessed it. It is a quality! Millions of people
can see the beauty. There is no question of competition, there is no
quarrel. On the contrary, the more people see the beauty of the moon,
the more beautiful it becomes.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, this has been one of the greatest observations of poets,
painters, and the people who move in the dimension of aesthetics: that
when a poet writes a poem about the moon he reveals some beauty of the
moon which was not available before. And many more people will be able
to see it now; their sensitivity will be aroused.</p><p><br></p><p>You have seen the sun rising, but if you have seen the paintings of
Vincent Van Gogh of the sun rising, the sun in the middle of the day,
the sun setting, you will be surprised: he has a totally different way
of looking at the sun. He was so madly in love with the sun as nobody
has ever been. For one year continuously he was painting the sun and the
sun and the sun, and he was standing continuously under the sun for one
year. It was so hot, but he wanted to catch the sun in all its moods. He
caught the sun in all its moods, in all its whims, in all its
expressions, but he himself went mad. One year just standing under the
sun, looking at the sun – the heat was too much, he could not bear it.
His love for the sun was such that he went mad for it.</p><p><br></p><p>If you see Van Gogh’s paintings of the sun you will become, for the
first time, aware of the beauty of the sun. When you will look at the
sun, something of Van Gogh’s vision will have penetrated your soul.</p><p><br></p><p>Nature is more beautiful because there have been nature poets. Nature
is more beautiful because there have been nature painters. Nature is
more beautiful because many, many people have seen beauty in it and that
has become a heritage that has penetrated our beings.</p><p><br></p><p>Truth is not like money, truth is like beauty. The more people see
it, the more clear it is. The more people have it, the more people can
have it. There is no question of coveting.</p><p><br></p><p>But the woman had only heard, the woman had only gathered rumors
about the Fruit of Heaven. Now she must be feeling very miserable, in
despair: “Others have attained and I have not attained. I have to show
to the world, I have to prove myself.”</p><p><br></p><p>This is an ego trip, this is not true search; this is the same ego
trip. Some people are trying to collect more and more money so they can
stand on the pile of money and declare to the world, “Nobody has more
than I have.” Somebody else is moving into the world of power-politics
so he can become</p><p>the president of a country and declare, “Look! I have arrived.” And
then there are others who are thinking that when they have attained to
the Fruit of Heaven they will show the world: “Now do you know who I am?
I am a Realized Person. I have Attained and you are all Ignorant, and
you are all Sinners and you are all still crawling in the mud of the
world. I have gone beyond it.” Then one can have that look which is
known as “holier-than-thou”.</p><p><br></p><p>This woman coveted it. If you hear about truth, God, enlightenment,
there arises a great desire: “Others are having something which I am not
having. I must have it.”</p><p><br></p><p>It is just like somebody else having a beautiful house, and you covet
it; somebody else has a beautiful wife, and you covet. Is truth a
beautiful house? Is truth a beautiful woman?</p><p><br></p><p>Truth is not a thing, truth is a no-thing. Truth is not a commodity
there outside you, it is an experience, it is in your interiority. It is
felt, lived at the very core of your being. It cannot be possessed, it
cannot be coveted – but that’s how it goes on.</p><p><br></p><p>Just the other day somebody has asked, “If I can convince him, he
will become a sannyasin. If I can convince him that by wearing orange
and the mala he will attain to bliss”... Now this is greed, and a greedy
person cannot be a sannyasin. And it is not a question of my convincing
you; you will have to convince me that you are worth being initiated
into sannyas. You will have to convince me that you have not come to
enquire just because others are talking about God, but that a great
inner desire has arisen in you, a longing, a thirst, that you are
aflame, that a passion has arisen in you that “Life is useless if I
don’t know who I am, if I don’t know from where I come and if I don’t
know to where I am going. I have to know it, because without knowing it,
whatsoever I am doing is foolish, is going to be stupid. Without knowing
who I am whatsoever I do is meaningless. Meaning can arise only when I
know my nature and start moving according to my nature. When there is a
harmony of me and the existence that surrounds me, only then can there
be joy and bliss.”</p><p><br></p><p>Bliss is not something to be desired, bliss is not something to be
coveted.</p><p><br></p><p>But the person who had asked must have come here hearing others
saying that if you become a sannyasin you will attain to God, to bliss.
Now he wants me to convince him.</p><p><br></p><p>I am not a salesman! I am not selling God to you! Why should I
convince you? If you are thirsty you will come to the river. The river
does not bother, the river is not in any need of convincing you, that “I
am water and I can quench your thirst.” If you are thirsty you will try.
You will have to try; there is no other way.</p><p><br></p><p>But the problem always arises because we hear others, we don’t feel
any passion arising in our own being. Our passion is borrowed,
superficial. And a man, who has no passion for truth of his own is not
yet man. He is still part of the animal world, he is still living
unconsciously. At least something – just even a small thirst will do –
but you will have to bring a thirst of your own.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard...</p><p><br></p><p>A tramp knocked at a cottage door, and when it was opened he said to
the housewife, “Beg pardon mum, but I wonder if you would not sew a
button on a coat for me.”</p><p>“Why yes, my man,” said the woman, a kindly soul. “Come in.” The
tramp entered and handed the woman a button.</p><p>“Very well,” she said, “now where is the coat?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah, I ain’t got nothing but the button, mum. I was thinking maybe
you would sew the coat on.”</p><p><br></p><p>But people who start searching for God don’t even have the button. I
am ready to supply the coat, but at least bring the button! At least a
little thirst of your own, your own heart beating a little faster, a
readiness to risk, a readiness to devote something, to dedicate, a
readiness to sacrifice something... a readiness to risk.…</p><p><br></p><p>SHE ASKED A CERTAIN DERVISH, WHOM WE SHALL CALL SABAR, “HOW CAN I
FIND THIS FRUIT, SO THAT I MAY ATTAIN TO IMMEDIATE KNOWLEDGE?”</p><p><br></p><p>Sabr or Sabar is a significant word: it means patience.</p><p><br></p><p>SHE ASKED A CERTAIN DERVISH, WHOM WE SHALL CALL SABAR, “HOW CAN I
FIND THIS FRUIT, SO THAT I MAY ATTAIN TO IMMEDIATE KNOWLEDGE?”</p><p><br></p><p>These parables are pieces of objective art. Each word has
significance, and each word has to be meditated upon. Why should we call
this dervish Sabar? That is not his name, certainly. That’s why the
story says, “We shall call him Sabar.”</p><p><br></p><p>Sabar comes from sabr: it means infinite patience. Those who are in
search will need infinite patience. Patience is the greatest religious
quality; if you have patience nothing else is needed. Patience is
enough, enough unto itself. Patience means hope, trust, and without any
hurry, without any impatience. Impatience simply shows that you are not
trustful. Impatience simply shows that you want to impose yourself upon
the will of God, that you want it right now. You don’t want him to work
on his own. Impatience means, “My will is greater than your will.”
Patience means, “I surrender my will to your will. Let you be my will,
so whenever I am ripe, whenever – if it takes an eternity it is okay – I
will trust, I will hope. I will not lose my heart, I will not be
disheartened.”</p><p><br></p><p>Just think of patience... it will bring a meditation on its own. The
man of patience becomes meditative because he becomes contented. He
says, “God is looking after me so why should I worry?”</p><p><br></p><p>The more God has disappeared from the world, the more worries have
entered into the world. You can watch it; there is a certain
relationship. When people are in trust, in faith, when people know that
God is, that we are taken care of, that we are not strangers on this
earth, that we belong, that there is some invisible hand that is always
ready to take us in the right direction, that we can live without worry,
contentment arises, peace, silence, tranquility, a serenity.</p><p><br></p><p>All is lost now because trust in God is lost. The moment man loses
God, he loses all – because then he has to depend only on himself, and
he is tiny, and the existence is vast. Man is just an atom and the atom
is trying to struggle with this infinite existence. There is bound to be
tension, anguish, despair, frustration, worry, suicide, madness.</p><p>The religious person is one who is relaxed with existence, who does
not push the river; on the contrary, who dissolves into the river and
says to the river, “Take me wherever you are going, because wherever you
are going is the goal.” The religious person, the person who is patient,
is one who says, “I will not seek and search a goal of my own, I don’t
have a private goal to seek and search. Wherever this infinite universe
is going I am also going.” So whatsoever is the destiny of the whole is
the destiny of the part. This is patience, this is sabr.</p><p><br></p><p>SHE ASKED A CERTAIN DERVISH, WHOM WE SHALL CALL SABAR, “HOW CAN I
FIND THIS FRUIT?...”</p><p><br></p><p>Now she is asking a wrong question. She says, “How can I find this
fruit?”</p><p><br></p><p>Remember Lao Tzu’s famous statement: “Seek and you will never find;
do not seek and it is already found.” In seeking you go astray, because
seeking means “my will”, non-seeking means let-go, disappearance of the
ego. And whenever you are not, God is. Lao Tzu is right: seek and you
will miss; do not seek and find.</p><p><br></p><p>Non-seeking is the way to find. It will look very strange, illogical,
but this is how it is. This existence is illogical; that’s why we call
it a mystery. If it were logical there would be no mystery. If the
existence were logical then there would be no need for religion, science
would have been enough. Science would have discovered everything if the
existence were logical. But it is not; fortunately, it is not. Logic
only goes to a certain extent, and then it flops. And when logic flops
the real existence begins.</p><p><br></p><p>Existence is a mystery. The way to it is not logic but love. The way
to it is not prose but poetry. The way to it is not the head but the
heart.</p><p><br></p><p>Now this woman says, “How can I find this fruit?” The question of
“how” is the question of the head, and the idea of finding this fruit is
egoistic: “I must possess.” It is the desire to possess and conquer and
be, “so that I may attain to immediate knowledge.” Now the whole desire
is how to attain the fruit so immediate knowledge is possible.</p><p><br></p><p>People are in a hurry – they want instant God, just like instant
coffee. They cannot wait. And when you cannot wait you simply say that
you don’t care much. If you care you can wait; the more you care the
more you can wait. If you really care you can wait for eternity. If you
don’t care then you are in a hurry. You say, “If it is possible right
now, instantly, okay; otherwise I am not going to waste time, it is not
worth wasting time.”</p><p><br></p><p>And God is not a seasonal flower, it is a cedar of Lebanon – it takes
time to grow. To reach to the clouds, it takes time. In fact time is not
enough, it takes eternity. Time falls short.</p><p><br></p><p>And I am not saying that God is not available now. Another paradox to
be understood: eternity is always now. The now is the door to eternity.
But that door is available only to the patient one, because those who
are in a hurry and say, “Instantly I want this,” their very hurry
creates such cloud and clamor in their minds; they cannot see the now.
To see the now one needs a very unclouded consciousness. And the
consciousness is unclouded only when there is no desire, no hurry, no
impatience, no longing. The consciousness is unclouded only when you are
not going anywhere. Just sitting silently, doing nothing, the spring
comes and the grass grows by itself. That is patience.</p><p>“YOU SHOULD BE BEST ADVISED TO STUDY WITH ME,” SAID THE DERVISH. “BUT
IF YOU WILL NOT DO SO, YOU WILL HAVE TO TRAVEL RESOLUTELY AND AT TIMES
RESTLESSLY THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.”</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what anybody who knows will say: “You would be best advised to
study with me.” What does he mean?</p><p><br></p><p>The word “study” has not that quality that Sabar must have used.</p><p><br></p><p>In India we have a word, swasthya. It can be translated as study, but
it misses the whole point. In fact, swasthya means self-study, studying
the self. It is not a question of reading scriptures, it is not a
question of going more and more into information. Rather it is a
question of going more and more inwards, into transformation.</p><p><br></p><p>And when Sufis say, “Study with us,” they simply mean “Be with us.”
Being with a Master is the study; just being with the Master, adab, just
being in the presence of the one who knows, drinking his presence,
savoring his being, tasting him, digesting his energy. You will be
surprised: if you come to a Sufi study circle, it has nothing to do with
the study circles that exist in the West. In a Western study circle you
read a book, then questions are raised and then questions answered, and
discussion follows.</p><p><br></p><p>In a Sufi study group no question is raised, no book is read. People
sit silently for hours, and maybe somebody starts swaying. But the one
thing to be remembered is: nobody has to do anything. If it happens it
is good. Somebody sometimes starts saying something, but the rule has to
be followed: nobody should try to say anything. If it happens on its
own, if one finds that something needs to be said, on its own is ready
to be said, is just on the tongue, wants to come out “in spite of me”,
then it’s okay.</p><p><br></p><p>It is just like the Quaker prayer meeting. Quakers learned it from
the Sufis. In the Middle Ages Sufis penetrated deep into European
countries. Quakers learned how to sit silently from the Sufis. The
Quakers sit silently for hours, then somebody may stand up and may start
saying something; but those statements are very inspired. They are not
from the person himself – as if God has taken possession of him. He has
become just a hollow bamboo, a flute, and some unknown energy has
started singing through him.</p><p><br></p><p>The rule has to be followed. But in a Quaker group it is very
difficult to follow the rule, because the basic thing is missing – the
Master is missing.</p><p><br></p><p>In a Sufi group the Master is a must. The Sufi group arises only when
the center is there. The Quaker group is just a traditional thing.They
learned it from Sufis but they missed one thing. They learned the
outward, adab, the etiquette, how to sit in silence – and it is good
even if without a Master; sitting in silence is good – but the mind is
very cunning. Your mind may play tricks; your mind may like to say
something, your mind may enjoy the idea that “Now I am the vehicle of
God.” And it is not that you are trying to deceive others; your mind can
deceive you and you may stand up, and you will feel as if you are not
doing anything. But there is no check in a Quaker group.</p><p><br></p><p>When you are with a Sufi Master there is a check. He will immediately
stop you; he will know when it is from your mind. Maybe it is from your
unconscious mind but it is still from your mind. You may</p><p>not be aware of from where it is coming; that does not mean that it
is coming from God. It may be coming from your own deep unconscious of
which you are not aware, so it looks as if it is coming from God. A
Master is needed, one who can see through and through, who is a mirror
not only of your conscious mind but of your unconscious too, before whom
you are utterly naked, before whom you cannot hide a thing. His very
presence prevents all strategies of the mind.</p><p><br></p><p>That is the meaning of being with a Master, adab. That’s what Sabar
means when he says, “You would be best advised to study with me, be with
me, learn to be here. Just watch what is happening here.”</p><p><br></p><p>But the woman was in a hurry. Study? She had not come to study. She
wanted to know immediately where the tree was, where was that garden,
and where was the Fruit of Heaven. She was not there to waste her time
in studying some nonsense. She wanted immediate results, she was in a
hurry. Sabar must have immediately felt it. So first he said, “You would
be best advised to study with me, but if you will not do so...” He must
have seen the mind of the woman – that she was not going to do it. She
was too much in a hurry; she could not be in the presence of a
Master.</p><p><br></p><p>“YOU WILL HAVE TO TRAVEL RESOLUTELY AND AT TIMES RESTLESSLY
THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.”</p><p><br></p><p>Then you can go, but one thing I must remind you of. Remember, you
will have to go throughout the world, resolutely and at times very
restlessly. The journey will be long. If you want it in such a hurry
then the journey will be very long. If you are ready to wait, the
journey can be very short. If you can wait infinitely it can happen
right now too, but if you cannot wait then it may take years or even
lives. It is up to you.</p><p><br></p><p>The woman missed. The people who are in a hurry always go on missing
the Masters, because the basic requirement to be with a Master is
patience, and they are impatient. She must have thought, “It is better
to go to somebody else who can show me a shortcut.”</p><p><br></p><p>SHE LEFT HIM AND SOUGHT ANOTHER, ARIF THE WISE ONE.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, arif means the knowledgeable. If you go to a real Master, a
perfect Master, he will demand many things from you. He will demand
utter surrender, just as Krishna says to his disciple Arjuna: Sarva
dharma parityajya mamekam sharnam braja – “Leave all your religions et
cetera, and come to my feet, surrender.”</p><p><br></p><p>The real Master will demand, and the greater the disciple, the
greater the demand is going to be, the more the potential, the more the
demand is going to be. The real Master is not there just to inform you,
he is there to transform you. But who wants to be transformed? People
want something without paying for it.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why the woman went to Arif. “Arif” means the knowledgeable
one. He is not a Master, he is a teacher. Teachers are many, Masters
very rare and very few. That’s why Sabar said, “You will have to go
around the whole earth, you will have to travel the whole world. Then
too, if you can find the Master again, it will be a rare fortune.”</p><p>You will meet many teachers; they exist everywhere. And they have
great appeal too, because they never demand. On the contrary, they
supply, they give you information, they make you more knowledgeable.
“Arif” means one who is very knowledgeable, a learned man who knows the
scriptures, knows doctrines, dogmas, can explain difficult problems of
theology, can go into subtleties, into very deep, logical complexities
of systems. But information can never satisfy. It is as futile as
informing a hungry person about bread: it is about and about, the bread
is never supplied. Great talk about the bread, but how can bread, just
by being talked about, be satisfying? The talk of the lamp will not
create light.</p><p><br></p><p>So soon the woman must have become frustrated. She must have gathered
a great knowledge, but she must have become frustrated. She moved.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s how people go on moving from one teacher to another teacher.
Even if they come across a Master, there is every possibility of missing
the Master – because they come with expectations. And no Master ever
fulfills anybody’s expectations; that is an absolute criterion. If
somebody fulfills your expectations he is a teacher. In fact he is a
follower of yours – he is fulfilling your expectations. The real Master
never fulfills your expectations. On the contrary, he goes on destroying
your expectations. Whatsoever you expect, he will never do; he will just
do the contrary. Why? – because if he fulfills your expectations he will
never be abIe to change you.</p><p><br></p><p>You have to be changed, utterly changed. You have to be burnt, in
toto. Your expectations come from your mind; your mind has to be
destroyed. Only then and only then is God possible. So how can a real
Master fulfill your expectations?</p><p><br></p><p>People go on changing from one teacher to another. A few days they
are on a honeymoon with one teacher, and then as every honeymoon fades
away, after a few days they are finished. When they first come across a
teacher they are very enchanted; it seems as if now the time has come
for fulfillment of their desire. But soon knowledge is supplied, and
knowledge cannot quench your thirst.</p><p><br></p><p>The woman must have felt frustrated, so she went to another, Hakim
the Sage. “Hakim” means the man who has character, “arif” means the man
who has knowledge. Now she is finished with knowledge. She has seen a
learned scholar but what is that to do? Now she wants some man who is
not only knowledgeable, but who has practised, who has something in his
character to say that he knows.</p><p><br></p><p>So she must have gone to another, Hakim the Sage. Now the man of
character has more appeal than the man of knowledge, because the man of
knowledge lives in an intellectual world which very few can understand,
but the man of character is very earthly, you can understand him. He
eats only once a day, he lives in poverty – it is so visible – he is a
celibate. Any stupid person can see. No intelligence is needed, no
intelligence is at all required, so foolish people become very much
attracted to character. And the people who create character around
themselves are also mediocre, because by creating a character nothing is
changed, never. Only your surface is painted in a better way, your inner
reality remains the same.</p><p><br></p><p>But it has-great influence on people. They can see, “Yes, this man is
not only a learned man, this is a man of God. Look how he lives, with
what simplicity, with what humbleness, how egoless he is.” It is so
plain on the surface; anybody can see.</p><p>So she went to the teacher, Hakim, the man of character. But sooner
or later you will see the hypocrisy. If you live long enough with the
man of character you will see the duality, that there are moments when
his real being surfaces, there are moments when he cannot manage his
so-called character. If you live long enough and if you watch the man of
character you will be able to see the contradictions of his life, the
hypocrisy. He is not one, he is many – or at least two. One is his real
essence which comes once in a while at certain moments, through certain
provocations. He may be a man of very great compassion if everything
goes according to him. If something goes against him, anger may surface.
For that anger you will have to be with such a man for a long time,
because once in a while he will flare up. He may have repressed his sex,
may have become celibate, but once in a while the repressed desire may
come to the conscious mind – he may behave contradicting his character.
Because the duality has not been dissolved, it is bound to assert – so
she must have been tired, seeing the hypocrisy.</p><p><br></p><p>She went to Majzub the Mad. “Majzub” means the mad. In a way she was
coming closer. First she went to the man of knowledge, Arif, which is
very superficial. Then she went to the man of character, which is a
little bit more practical, not just heady. He had tried to do something
with his life, even if he was wrong; but his sincerity could not be
suspected. He may have been full of errors but he was sincere. He had
tried to do – in a stupid way of course – but he had tried to do.</p><p><br></p><p>Now she went to a madman, Majzub. “Majzub” means one who is utterly
drowned in God, lost, has attained the state of fana, is no more. She
had come to the best man.</p><p><br></p><p>But there is a problem with a majzub: he cannot be a Master. He is so
mad, he cannot help. He is utterly lost, he is not in any way capable of
helping. In fact, he himself needs the help of an enlightened person so
that some sanity can be brought back to him.</p><p><br></p><p>This kind of work has rarely been done in the world, but one of the
greatest Masters of this age, Meher Baba, did it. He was also here in
Poona, and the Poona people were as much against him as they are against
me, for the same reasons – because he would not fulfill their
expectations. He was a man of God. He did something so tremendously
valuable that it is rarely done, but no history books will ever mention
it because histories are written by fools about other fools. Histories
are written by people who don’t know anything about the deeper
phenomenon that goes on happening. Histories are written about
politicians, stupid politicians, Adolf Hitler and so many books.…</p><p><br></p><p>If you want to see all the books about Adolf Hitler, you can go to
Samarpan’s room. He has them all, he is the expert; so many books. And
people go on writing as if there is something important. Can’t you
forget these stupid, neurotic people? Is there any need to keep their
memory alive forever? It will be very good to drop them out of history.
They are wounds! But flowers are not talked about, only wounds.</p><p><br></p><p>Meher Baba is not part of history. Nobody has tried to see the great
experiment that he did. He travelled all over the country to catch hold
of all kinds of majzubs, madmen, because they are just very close to
God. Only one thing is needed: somebody is needed who can shake them
back to their sanity. Then they can become great Masters. Just a little
sanity will be needed; then their madness will have a method in it.
Right now they are only mad without any method; they cannot help. And to
follow them may be dangerous, hazardous. To follow them, you will be
only following yourself because they will never give you any clue. And
whatsoever they will say, if you follow it,</p><p>can lead you astray. It can throw you into deep pitfalls, because
they are not in their consciousness; they have drowned themselves in God
so much that they are drunk, they are drunkards. They have known God but
they have no way to relate it to you. They cannot be Masters.</p><p><br></p><p>Each Master becomes a majzub before he becomes a Master – he goes
through great madness – but all majzubs are not Masters. If a majzub
dies as a majzub, he will attain to God but without helping anybody at
all.</p><p><br></p><p>Now she had come to a right person, but the person was not a Master
and could not be a Master. He could not supply any method.</p><p><br></p><p>So she started moving again to somebody who could supply a method. So
she went to the fourth, Alim. “Alim” means the scientist, the
methodologist, one who can give you the methods. She has again moved far
away, because it is not necessary that the person who can give you the
method knows what he is doing, because methods can be gathered from
scriptures. You can read Patanjali’s YOGA SUTRAS and you can start
giving methods to others; that is not going to help.</p><p><br></p><p>A majzub cannot give methods. And the person who gives methods, if he
has not been a majzub, is of no use. The majzub cannot be followed – it
is dangerous, because you will be following a madman – and you cannot
follow Alim, the scientist, because he himself does not know anything.
He has gathered about methods, he is interested, he is a collector of
methods.</p><p><br></p><p>There are many people who go on writing commentaries on the YOGA
SUTRAS of Patanjali, and they have never meditated, they have never
known what meditation is. But they know all about meditation. Many times
they have come to me; they have written beautiful commentaries, they are
very knowledgeable, learned, scholarly. You cannot find any fault with
their language, with their exposition, but there is no experience to
support what they are saying. There is not much difference between them
and the ignorant people.</p><p><br></p><p>... AND MANY MORE. She went to many more.</p><p><br></p><p>SHE PASSED THIRTY YEARS IN HER SEARCH. FINALLY SHE CAME TO A
GARDEN.</p><p><br></p><p>The garden is again a symbol. The story of the world starts with the
garden, the Garden of Eden, Adam and Eve, and life was eternally
beautiful and blissful. The garden is the beginning of existence. And
then Adam and Eve were thrown out, or threw themselves out, by eating
the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge.</p><p><br></p><p>The moment you become knowledgeable you lose innocence. And innocence
is the garden. In innocence, flowers bloom. In innocence, fragrance is
released. In innocence, all is bliss. The garden is a symbol for
innocence. And since Adam and Eve left the garden, man has been
searching for the garden again and again.</p><p><br></p><p>The teqir, or the school of the Master, is called the garden of the
Master – because with a Master you start vomiting the fruit of the Tree
of Knowledge. The Master is nothing but a process of taking out all the
poison of knowledge from your system so that you can become innocent
again. And when Adam is innocent, Adam becomes Christ. He enters the
garden again – paradise lost, paradise regained.…</p><p>And do you know what the word “paradise” means? It comes from a Sufi
word fIRDHAUS. Firdhaus means a walled garden. That is from where the
word “paradise” comes. Paradise is the garden. We have lost the garden
somewhere in the past: we have to regain it. We have to be again as
innocent as children and immediately we are back in the garden. In fact
we have always been in the garden, but our eyes are so full of knowledge
that we cannot see the garden. When the eyes are cleaned of knowledge
and the dust of knowledge disappears from the mirror of consciousness,
suddenly the whole garden explodes.</p><p><br></p><p>SHE PASSED THIRTY YEARS IN HER SEARCH. FINALLY SHE CAME TO A GARDEN.
THERE STOOD THE TREE OF HEAVEN, AND FROM ITS BRANCHES HUNG THE BRIGHT
FRUIT OF HEAVEN.</p><p><br></p><p>STANDING BESIDE THE TREE WAS SABAR.…</p><p><br></p><p>You can imagine the shock the woman must have gone through. Sabar?
And he was the first one she had come across.</p><p><br></p><p>STANDING BESIDE THE TREE WAS SABAR.…</p><p><br></p><p>That too is a beautiful metaphor: if you want to attain to the Fruit
of Heaven, you will have to pass through the custodian, sabar,
patience.</p><p><br></p><p>Patience is the door back to the garden.</p><p><br></p><p>The First Dervish was standing by the side of the tree.”</p><p><br></p><p>WHY DID YOU NOT TELL ME WHEN WE FIRST MET THAT YOU WERE THE CUSTODIAN
OF THE FRUIT OF HEAVEN?” SHE ASKED HIM.</p><p><br></p><p>“BECAUSE YOU WOULD NOT THEN HAVE BELIEVED ME.”</p><p><br></p><p>A truth can be told only when you are ready for it. A truth can be
given to you only when you are worthy of it. A truth can be transferred
only when you have become a receptacle, not before it, not a single
moment before it. When you are ripe, mature, ready, then not even a
single moment passes by; Immediately... here you are ripe and there you
are given the truth.</p><p><br></p><p>The Master cannot load you with something that is unnecessary. The
unnecessary load will be heavy on you. It will be destructive, it may
turn into poison, it will not nourish you. It may give you weight but it
will not give you vitality.</p><p><br></p><p>“BECAUSE YOU WOULD NOT THEN HAVE BELIEVED ME. BESIDES, THE TREE
PRODUCES FRUIT ONLY ONCE IN THIRTY YEARS AND THIRTY DAYS.”</p><p><br></p><p>Even if you had believed you would have had to wait. Even if you had
believed, this time had to be passed in infinite patience; for that also
you were not ready. So the best course was this: that I should allow you
to go from one teacher to another, from one school to another school,
and come back again when the time was ripe. You are ripe now, because
you have seen through all the falsities.</p><p>You have been to Arif, the man of knowledge, and it was not enough.
How can knowledge ever be enough? Knowledge is knowledge. To know about
water is not going to quench your thirst.</p><p><br></p><p>You went to Hakim, the man of character, but the real man has no
character. The real man lives moment to moment. The real man has
consciousness but no conscience. The religious man knows nothing of
morality; although he lives in morality he knows nothing of it. The real
man has no character; he is characterless, although only he has
character.</p><p><br></p><p>What do I mean by this contradiction? He has no programed character,
he does not live in a readymade way, he is not predictable. Each moment
he responds in a fresh way. He is true, he is one, he is integrated, but
these things are not imposed on him. He has not practised them. He has
only worked for one thing: he has tried to become more and more
conscious. Now out of his consciousness, each moment characters arise
and disappear. But he does not carry the load of a structure around
himself. He has no armor of the character. He is continuously free; he
is freedom.</p><p><br></p><p>You went to Hakim, and then you knew that all character, imposed
character, carries hypocrisy in it.</p><p><br></p><p>Then you went to Majzub and he was a real man, but he was so mad that
he could not teach you anything. Seeing that he could not teach you any
method, you went to Alim, the methodologist, who knows everything about
methods. But he had never done anything; it was not based in his own
experience.</p><p><br></p><p>All this was needed, everything was good, and you have come back
right in time, because “this Tree produces fruit only once in thirty
years and thirty days.” Even if you had believed – which was impossible
– you could not have understood. Even if I had said, “I am the
custodian,” you may have thought, “This man is very egoistic – claiming
himself to be the custodian?” That may have put you off. You could not
have understood it, because you had come with the expectation that the
man of knowing is humble.</p><p><br></p><p>The man of real understanding is neither arrogant nor humble. He
simply is not, he only states the fact. It can hurt you, but that is
your responsibility, that is your problem. He does not want to hurt you,
ke has no desire to hurt anybody but his statements can hurt. And when
they hurt, you will think they are being made in arrogance, in anger.
They are not made in any anger or arrogance; be is simply stating a
fact, as it is.</p><p><br></p><p>Sabar says: “BECAUSE YOU WOULD NOT THEN HAVE BELIEVED ME.”</p><p><br></p><p>And it was better not to say anything that you could not believe. It
was better for me to wait for you; and I have also been waiting. And I
am Sabar, I can wait; that’s why I am the custodian. And you have come
right in time. Now don’t feel worried and don’t think those thirty years
have been a wastage. Nothing is a wastage. All those experiences – even
going through false teachers, even going through unnecessary paths –
have helped you. It has ripened you, it has made you mature. Now you are
ready; I can deliver the fruit to you.”</p><p><br></p><p>And that’s what is happening here: many come, only a few stay. Many
come, but I cannot tell them that now there is no need to go anywhere,
you have arrived home. I can tell that only to a few people, only to
those who are ready to understand, who are ripe to understand. Otherwise
I have to</p><p>tell people to go, to search, to seek. Hopefully, after thirty years
and thirty days, if I am here and you come back, you may be able to
understand, and I may be able to give to you what i can give to you
right now, but you will not take it.</p><p><br></p><p>The greatest thing in life is to be ready to take, to receive, to be
feminine, to be a womb. And the real disciple is one who becomes
feminine, who becomes a womb. When he is with the Master he is just
receptive, passive. He drops all seeking, all searching, all hankering.
He forgets all about truth, all about God and paradise and all that. He
simply goes on allowing the Master to enter him; he becomes the host for
the Master.</p><p><br></p><p>And when you disappear completely and the Master has filled you
completely, the Master also disappears. And in the disappearance of the
disciple and the Master is paradise, the garden. You have come back
home.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part18>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

HE ALSO OBJECTED TO YOU BEING CALLED BHAGWAN. OSHO, WOULD YOU PLEASE COMMENT ON IT?\nAnand Maitreya, sex is a natural phenomenon, as natural as a rose flower, or dewdrops on the grass leaves in the early morning. And it is the most beautiful phenomenon too, as beautiful as the calling of a cuckoo, as beautiful as the stars in the sky. But down the ages it has been condemned.\nCondemning sex has been one of the most important strategies to dominate man. The moment you condemn sex you have condemned life itself. Life arises out of sex; life is an expression of sex. If you can find God anywhere, utterly present, it is the moment of sexual orgasm. But to condemn sex is a great strategy. Through it you condemn man indirectly; you poison his very source of being. And then he feels guilty, a sinner, worthless; and then it is easy to dominate him, it is easy to manipulate him, it is easy to exploit him – and that’s what the politicians and the priests have been doing.\nThey don’t want you to have freedom, they don’t want you to enjoy life, because the man who is blissful is rebellious. The man who is enjoying his life cannot be easily dominated – it is very difficult to dominate him – and cannot easily be deceived, because he has clarity.\nShree Morarji Desai is a very repressed person as far as sex is concerned. Now, this seems very strange. My discourses have been collected in two hundred books, books on Vedanta, books on Tao, books on Yoga, books on Sufism, books on the Upanishadas, books on the Geeta, the Bible, the Tao Te Ching, but he has been reading only one book – FROM SEX TO SUPERCONSCIOUSNESS. An eighty-three-year-old man, has remained celibate for almost fifty years, why should he be interested in the book FROM SEX TO SUPERCONSCIOUSNESS? Certainly he is not interested in superconsciousness, because I have written two hundred books on superconsciousness. His interest seems to be sex. That’s how it happens.\nI have read his autobiography. In his autobiography he remembers that when young he went to see the Mother of Shree Aurobindo Ashram. She was a beautiful woman. Before she came to Shree Aurobindo, she was an actress; she had grace and a charisma of her own. And she was moving deeply into spirituality. But what did Morarji Desai see in her? What he saw shows much about him, not about the Mother.\nThe Mother’s disciples were coming to touch her feet, and sometimes a disciple would get so ecstatic just by touching her feet that he would start rolling, and sometimes his head would fall into the Mother’s lap. And Morarji was horrified. He thought in his mind, “So that’s why they are looking so ecstatic – just rolling in her lap. Her shapely, beautiful thighs.” That’s what he saw. He went away – “This is not spirituality. These people are sex obsessed. This is a vulgar expression of sexuality.” That’s all that he saw in the Mother and the disciples; he could not see anything more.\nAnd that was when he was young. Now fifty years have passed, and fifty years’ constant repression of sex has become a wound in him. He is boiling within with sexuality.\nWhen I read this question from Anand Maitreya I was reminded of a few stories I would like to tell you.\n“It is an outrage the way those nudists are carrying on in that apartment,” the old woman told the policeman when he answered her call. “I am ashamed.”\nThe cop looked out of the window and could see nothing but a vast courtyard, a road, and an apartment building in the distance. “I can’t see a thing,” he shrugged.\n“Of course you can’t,” the old woman replied. “But just have a look through these binoculars and you will see plenty.”\nWhat he has seen in the book FROM SEX TO SUPERCONSCIOUSNESS is nothing but his own mind reflected in it. There is nothing indecent, but the very idea of sex creates in his mind the feeling of indecency. Maybe the very word “sex” revives something in him that has been repressed, that he has been sitting upon. The very word must be creating a ripple. All those repressed feelings, instincts must be surfacing. That’s why he thinks it is indecent. It depends on you.\nThere are people who go to Khajuraho and think it is indecent. It is not. It is one of the most beautiful and one of the most spiritual temples in the world. If you look into those stone statues, yes, there are both things present, those statues represent the lowest and the highest: they are from sex to superconsciousness. But the person who is obsessed with sex – and all repressive persons are\nobsessed – will not be able to see anything else other than the sex. He will miss the real point. The real point is in the faces, in the eyes turned upward, in those beautiful faces in which orgasmic ecstasy has been sculptured. The stones have become sermons.\nBut it depends on how you have lived. Have you lived a life of affirmation? Then you will be able to see. If you have lived a life of negation, then it will be impossible for you to see.\nAn ancient Sufi parable:\nJalal, an old friend of Mulla Nasrudin’s, called one day. The Mulla said, “I am delighted to see you after such a long time. I am just about to start on a round of visits, however. Come, walk with me, and we can talk.”\n“Lend me a decent robe,” said Jalal, “because, as you see, I am not dressed for visiting.” Nasrudin lent him a very fine robe.\nAt the first house Nasrudin presented his friend. “This is my old companion, Jalal. But the robe he is wearing, that is mine!”\nOn their way to the next village, jalal said, “What a stupid thing to say!‘The robe is mine’? Indeed! Don’t do it again.” Nasrudin promised.\nWhen they were comfortably seated at the next house, Nasrudin said, “This is Jalal, an old friend, come to visit me. But the robe – the robe is his!”\nAs they left, Jalal was just as annoyed as before. “Why did you say that? Are you crazy?” “I only wanted to make amends. Now we are quits.”\n“If you do not mind,” said Jalal, slowly and carefully, “we shall not say any more about the robe.” Nasrudin promised.\nAt the third and final place of call, Nasrudin slid, “May I present Jalal, my friend. And the robe, the robe he is wearing.But we must not say anything about the robe, must we?”\nOnce you are trying to repress a thought, it comes up again and again and again. Morarji Desai is not only obsessed with sex in this life, he will remain obsessed even in coming lives. His whole approach is unscientific, unnatural. He has not been able to understand what he is doing. He has not been able to see that, how can sex be indecent? Certainly he is not born out of a virgin mother. Certainly his children are born out of his sexual relationship with his wife. But because of his obsession he has even been very hard with his children.\nOne of his daughters committed suicide, and it is just because of his obsessively puritan mind. He has been hard upon himself and hard upon his children too.\nThe person who is obsessed with something unnatural is perverted. And through this obsession he has lost all intelligence. Intelligence grows out of being natural. Intelligence is a shadow of being\nnatural and spontaneous. The perverted person is bound to become stupid because he is constantly fighting within himself. His whole energy becomes a kind of civil war. The person who is fighting nature is indecent, and the total outcome is stupidity.\nI don’t see any indecency in sex, because this is how God has chosen to create life. Sex is his method. Just as a painter paints with his brush, God has been creating this existence with sexual energy. To deny SeX, to condemn sex, is to condemn God. If you call sex indecent you are calling God indecent because this whole existence is nothing but an expression of sexual energy.\nThese birds chirping, singing, do you think they are praising Prime Minister Morarji Desai? This is sexual expression. The whole poetry of a life consists of sexual energy. The whole beautyWhat\nis beauty? The very feeling that something is beautiful comes out of sexual energy.\nA woman looks beautiful to you. Why? Why does the call of the cuckoo from the mango grove sound beautiful to you? Why? It is, deep down, an expression of sex, love.\nBut the people like Morarji Desai live without love. In fact, a politician cannot afford to be loving. He cannot live, he cannot love, he cannot laugh.\nI have heard a story about him. I don’t know how far it is correct. It is a joke – and jokes need not be correct, but they are always true!\nMorarji Desai was having his photograph taken by a press cameraman. The photographer had a lot of trouble trying to get his subject to pose properly. Eventually, after much bickering, he was about to take the picture.\n“Look pleasant for a moment,” said the photographer. “Then you can resume your normal expression.”\nHe cannot laugh; laughter must be indecent. He cannot take life playfully; playfulness must be indecent.\nAnd this man has written a story on Krishna. Now the story is going to be filmed. Not that he is a great author, but just because he is the Prime Minister; so now the story is going to be filmed. I am puzzled, surprised, at what he must be thinking about Krishna. His whole life must be looking indecent to him because Krishna’s whole life is love, playfulness, joy, celebration. What does Morarji Desai think about this incident in Krishna’s life?\nA few beautiful women were taking their bath in the Yamuna River. And this is not a story of today. It is a story from when India used to be alive, five thousand years ago, when India used to be really vibrant, when people were courageous enough to love and laugh and dance, when people were not life negative; but when life was thought to be God and divine and people were not talking about life as if it is indecent.\nKrishna passed by. The women were taking their bath naked in the Yamuna River. Now no Indian woman will do it. Those days were beautiful; people were more open. Now this can happen only in my ashram, nowhere else. Krishna is still alive here.\nKrishna saw those beautiful women swimming and floating in the water and enjoying, and they were completely unaware of the presence of Krishna. He gathered their clothes, which were on the bank, and climbed a tree and sat there. When they were finished, those women looked around; their clothes were gone. They started searching; then they saw Krishna sitting in the tree with all the clothes with him.\nNow what does Morarji Desai think about this? Certainly I have never done anything like that! Krishna must look very indecent.\nIt is not that Krishna is indecent. It is just Morarji Desai’s sexual perversion.\nAnd he says that he found it distasteful. That too is strange. A man who goes on drinking his own urine, and has not yet found it distasteful.And I am certainly certain that he does not suffer from\ndiabetes – otherwise the urine may have a little sweetness.\nHe found the book distasteful? What taste has he got? What is he talking about? What aesthetic sense has he got? He is the most unpoetic person alive in this country.\nI have heard...\nA gypsy and a hippie had an argument as to who could withstand foul smell longer. They decided to remain with a skunk in a small pen. First the gypsy went in. He ran out in desperation after a couple of minutes. Then the hippie took his turn.\nAfter a minute, the skunk bolted!\nThe gypsy was puzzled. He said, “How did you manage?”\nThe hippie said, “I am a follower of Morarji Desai. I live only on garlic and water of life.” “Water of life” is a euphemism for your own urine.\nThis man thinks that my book is distasteful? He is simply saying something about himself, not about the book. It always depends on you, how you interpret what you read. He must have read my book, but he must have understood in his own way, he must have interpreted it in his own way. The interpretation is indecent. What he has read into it is his own mind.\nIf an ugly man faces a mirror, the mirror cannot be blamed for his ugliness. And calling the mirror ugly won’t do.\nThe book FROM SEX TO SUPERCONSCIOUSNESS must have functioned as a mirror. He must have become agitated because if that book is right, then his whole life has been stupid and wasted stupidly. He must have felt very antagonistic, hurt in his ego. His whole life he has been struggling with sex, fighting with sex, and now here I am saying that without a deep experience of sex you will never know love, and without a deep experience of love you will never know prayer. And here I am saying that sex is the first experience of God. And here I am saying that without moving into life with totality you will never come to know the innermost core of it.\nNothing has to be denied, because whatsoever is denied will take its revenge. That’s what is happening to him. He is not angry at me; he is angry at a mirror because the mirror is showing his face.\nI have heard, a very rich woman, but very ugly too, asked a great painter, Goya, to make a portrait of her. Goya was hesitant, he wanted to say no, but it was difficult. The woman was ready to pay any price. He asked a very fantastic price, thinking that she would say no and he could get out of it and there would be no need to paint this woman’s face, but she said, “Yes, you start.” So he painted the portrait; it was just a blob of colors. When the woman came, she said, “What? You have not done a good job. Is this my portrait?” He said, “What can I do, madam? I wanted to get out of it. Nature has not done a good job. What can I do? I cannot improve upon nature. I am here just to paint you as you are. That’s why I was very reluctant. I am just a mirror.”\nI have received thousands of letters, from all kinds of people, that they have been immensely benefited by the same book that Morarji Desai says is indecent. But sex is on his mind too much.\nA monk consulted a psychiatrist for help with various problems. The analyst said, “Stretch out here on the couch. Just relax and tell me about your early life. Just keep on talking. Say anything that comes to mind.”\nThe monk proceeded to spill out his life story. Suddenly the analyst took out a big balloon and sitting behind the patient, blew it up to full size. Then he stuck a pin in it. The balloon burst with a loud crash. The patient was startled. The doctor said sharply, “Now tell me, quick, what did you think about when you heard the loud explosion?”\n“I thought of sex.”\n“Sex? At such a moment? You thought about sex?”\n“Well,” said the patient, “what is so surprising about that? It is all I ever think about.”\nA monk is a monk, and a monk always thinks about sex. The more he escapes from the world and its reality, the more and more he fantasizes about it.\nMorarji Desai has remained a monk. He has not known the beauties of existence, and he is angry with me because my very presence makes him aware that his life has been a wastage.\nAnd the second thing you say, “He also objected to you being called Bhagwan.”\nI am Bhagwan, just as you are Bhagwan. Even Morarji Desai is a Bhagwan. Bhagwan does not mean somebody sitting there high in the heavens. Bhagwan simply means that which is hidden behind you, within you, that which you are. I am Bhagwan because I have recognized it.\nI am not calling myself Bhagwan. I am.\nYou are also, but you have not yet gathered courage to recognize the fact. It needs guts to recognize your reality. It needs utter humbleness to see things as they are. It needs simplicity of the heart to say things as they are.\nMorarji Desai is also a Bhagwan, just as everything else is, trees and rocks and animals. God is not separate from existence; God is immanent in it. Only God is. If only God is, then I am God, then you are God, then everything is divine. But God can be fast asleep; that’s how Morarji Desai is: a god fast asleep, dreaming that he has become the Prime Minister, snoring.\nWake up.\nBut it is very difficult to wake up when you are a prime minister because then one is afraid – if one wakes up and finds that it was only a dream.One has invested in the dream too much.\n“I had a dream the other night, Casey, an’ it taught me a great lesson.” “Bedad, an’ what was the lisson, Pat?”\n“‘Twas like this. I dreamed I wuz in Rome, an’ I had a audience with the Pope – as great a gentleman as any in the district, an’ thot’s no lie. Would I have a drink, he axed me. Thinks I, would a duck swim, an’ seein’ the whiskey an’ lemons an’sugar on the sideboard, I told him I wouldn’t mind if I had a wee drop of punch.’Cold or hot?’ asked His Riv’rence.’Hot, Yer Holiness,’ says I. Ah, what a mistake I made!”\n“I don’t see anything wrong –”\n“Ah, but listen, boy. His Holiness stepped toward the kitchen for the b’ilin water, and before he got back, I woke up. Nex’ time, I’ll say, I’ll take it cold Yer Holiness, while the water’s a-gettin’ hot!”\nWhen you have a dream, a sweet dream, it is very difficult to listen to people who are shouting, “Wake up!” That’s why it is very difficult for people who have succeeded in life to wake up. Their very success becomes their curse, They think they are doing perfectly well.\nHave you not watched it in your dreams? If you are having a sweet dream it continues; if you are having a nightmare it wakes you up. If somebody is going to kill you and is just chasing you with a bayonet, a moment comes when you simply wake up, perspiring of course, but you wake up. A nightmare is good in that sense, that it wakes you up. But if you are having a beautiful dream – you are Krishna, and all the beautiful women of the world are dancing around you like your gopis, girlfriends – who wants to wake up? One only hopes that this dream continues.\nMorarji Desai is also as divine as I am, but God is fast asleep and snoring.\nWhy should he be angry if I am being called Bhagwan? What has that to do with him? But many people are angry, and the anger has some reason in it. The reason is that if somebody is awakened, his very presence disturbs your sleep. You cannot sleep as comfortably as before. Somebody is awakened, so all that you are going into is a dream? You start feeling annoyed with the person who is awake. You start finding reasons that he must be wrong – “Why does he call himself God?”\nAnd that too from an Indian looks very absurd. It’s okay if Christians, Mohammedans, and Jews raise the question why I call myself God, because they have no insight into the phenomenon as deeply as it has happened in this country. Buddha never believed in God, never, but still we called\nhim Bhagwan. Mahavira never believed in God; still we have called him Bhagwan. So “Bhagwan” cannot be translated as “God”.\nGod is the creator of the world – and certainly I have not created this world. I cannot take that responsibility, excuse me! I am not God in the Christian sense.\nBut Morarji Desai is not a Christian. One can expect that he should understand that Bhagwan in the East does not mean God. Bhagwan means “the blessed one” – and I declare myself the blessed one. It simply means that I have been blessed; that I have come to a point where I am utterly content; that I have come to a state where I don’t desire anything anymore, there is nothing to be desired, all is available; that I have come to a state where mind is dissolved and I am one with existence. This is the state of the blessed one.\nBhagwan simply means one who has disappeared as a person and has become a presence. That’s why we could call Buddha Bhagwan, although he never believed in God the Creator.\nAnd there are people, like Morarji Desai, whose anger is this: that I have declared it myself, that I am a self-appointed Bhagwan. But how else can it be? How can it be otherwise? Who can appoint me Bhagwan? Buddha declared himself; he was self-appointed, not that there was a committee or a university senate or there was a vote in the country.\nPoliticians can’t think of anything else other than votes. He must be thinking who has voted for me, how am I Bhagwan, how many people have voted for and how many against.\nWho had voted for Krishna? Who had voted for Mahavira and Buddha? Who had voted for Christ? If Christ’s godhood depended on votes, he would have lost his deposit! He had not more than a hundred disciples, not more than that. And the real disciples were only twelve; the others were just sympathizers. How did Jesus become Christ? Who appointed him? How did Krishna declare, “I am that”? How did Buddha declare, “I have arrived”? They were all self-appointed. There is no other way.\nI have declared myself God. This is the only possible way, because when I have become blessed, when I have known the ultimate joy of experience, of existence, when I have seen truth, who else is needed to certify it? Do I need a character certificate from the politicians? I have declared it. There is nothing wrong, because that is the only way! If you have known love, only you can say that you have known love.\nI have known the ultimate samadhi, and only I can say it. And only a few people, who have attained to that, will be able to recognize it.\nMorarji Desai is simply saying that he cannot recognize it. But who is expecting him to recognize it? He has not known anything of meditation.\nJust on the day he became Prime Minister, somebody asked him, “Are all your desires fulfilled?” He said, “No, one desire is still there. I want to know God.” The man said, “Then have you ever meditated?” – a journalist must have asked. And Morarji Desai said, “I have not done anything like meditation, although Acharya Rajneesh has given me a meditation. But I could not do it, because I am too old and I cannot do such a vigorous meditation as he suggested.”\nNow, he is not too old to become the Prime Minister of a country like India, which has only problems and problems and problems and nothing else. And he is ten years older now than when I had talked to him and given him a meditation. Then he was only seventy-three, now he is eighty-three, but he says he is too old to meditate. But he is not too old to become a prime minister of a country and to take the whole burden of it.\nRationalization and nothing else. If you don’t want to meditate you can always find reasons. Whatsoever you want to do, you are ready to do it. He goes on running from one country to another country, he goes on traveling all over the country, he goes on fighting with other politicians, quarreling, and everything is done perfectly well; he has enough energy for all that. Just for meditation, no energy. And this is a twenty-four-hour job that he is doing, and meditation was to be done only for one hour. But he says he is too old for meditation.\nHe has not known anything of meditation; how can he know anything of what has happened in me, to me?\nYes, I declare myself Bhagwan – because I declare this whole world is Bhagwan. This whole world is blessed. If you don’t recognize the blessings that are being showered on you by existence, that is your responsibility; nobody else is responsible for it. I am open to all the blessings. That’s all I mean when I say I am Bhagwan – that I have no barriers, that I am in a state of let-go, that I am utterly open. Whatsoever existence wants me to do I will do, and whatsoever the existence does not want me to do I will not do. I am utterly annihilated. Fana fi’llah: I am absorbed in God, in this totality; that’s what I mean by the word “God”. And the moment this happened, fana fi’llah, I became baka bi’llah, I became suddenly all. I am in the shape of the tree. I am in the rays of the sun. Just as I am in this body, I am in you too.\nNow, this is my experience. I don’ t need any witnesses for it. Even if the whole world says it is not so, it is still so. It does not depend on you or your votes.\nBut the politicians can’t think of anything else; they only think of votes.\nBut why should he be puzzled, worried about me? He goes on constantly talking about me, as if I am haunting him.\nHe does not know what has happened to me and what can happen to him. But he has read scriptures, he can quote scriptures; but all that that he quotes is utterly borrowed! It is not his own.\nA lady who owned a very intelligent parrot one day discovered a leaky pipe in her kitchen. She called the plumber, but before he arrived she had to leave the house momentarily on an errand. During her absence the plumber came along and rang the doorbell.\n“Who is it?” called the parrot. “It is the plumber,” he said.\n“Who is it?” repeated the parrot.\n“It is the plumber!” he shouted. “Who is it?” said the parrot.\n“It is the PLUMBER! It is the PLUMBER!” he screamed, and in his frustration he collapsed right on the doorstep with a heart attack.\nOn returning home, the lady found him lying there. “Good heavens,” she said. “Who is it?” “It is the plumber,” said the parrot.\nWhat Morarji Desai knows about scriptures is just parrot-like.\nWhat I am saying to you has arisen in me. I am a witness to Buddha and to Krishna and to Christ and to Zarathustra and to Lao Tzu and to all those who have become awakened.\nBut his anger has, deep down, another reason too. Indira Gandhi has always liked my thoughts; she has always been in a kind of love towards my way of thinking. That is the deep root of why he is angry with me. Indira has the intelligence to understand me, more than he has, and Indira has a kind of receptivity and grace, and Indira also has guts and the courage to take some revolutionary steps – which are utterly needed.\nIt is because of her revolutionary steps that she lost the last elections. The masses behave in a very suicidal way. The logic has to be understood.\nThe masses are suffering because of a certain conditioning. It is because of a certain mind that India has that India has suffered in the past and is suffering now. Now, anything to change the situation, to change this suffering, will basically need a change in the conditioning of the masses. That is the problem. Everybody wants to get out of this suffering state, this continuous starvation. People are ill, hungry, dying, but if anything can change this situation, the first requirement will be that we change our ways of thinking. And that is difficult for the masses.\nThey have lived with a certain kind of mind, they have cherished that mind for centuries, and they are utterly unaware that their mind is the cause of their suffering. They want to change the outer situation, but they are unaware that the outer situation exists in a certain collaboration with their inner mind. So whenever somebody wants to change the outer situation, their inner mind is going to be hurt and wounded, and they will not be able to forgive such a person. That’s what happened to Indira.\nShe really tried. She has been the most courageous prime minister that India had in these past three decades. That was the problem, that she started doing something really significant. But then the masses were angry: their traditions were broken, their conditionings were broken.\nThe masses were angry, and the politicians, the opportunists of this country exploited the situation. But they have not been able to do anything – they cannot do – because if they want to keep the masses satisfied they have to agree with the mind, and if you agree with the mind you cannot change the situation. This is the dilemma. The masses will vote only for those people who follow the mind of the masses, but then those people cannot do a thing; they will be utterly impotent.\nThat’s what has happened to Morarji Desai and his government. It is utterly impotent. It has not been able to do a single thing. It cannot do! And the reason is – the next election is coming close by every day – if you do something that goes against the grain, you will be defeated. They know perfectly well how they have come into power: they have come into power because Indira tried to do something really revolutionary.\nShe was trying to impose compulsory birth control on the country. That is the only way it can be done. You cannot persuade the people, and if you persuade, it will take thousands of years to persuade them, and by that time there will be no point. In fact, this country has to have birth control within twenty-five years, otherwise it is doomed; by the end of this century it will not be possible for this country to exist at all. Everybody will be hungry and starving and ill, there will be no space left.\nThings are in such a state that they can only be done compulsorily. Birth control is the only way to prevent this population from growing, and if you wait for the masses to understand and if you wait for them to be educated, then it is not going to happen, ever.\nThat’s what angered Indians. Hindus, Mohammedans, everybody was angered. They thought their freedom was being taken away.\nIt is not a question of freedom or no freedom now. It is a question of life and death! The country is moving every day towards the abyss. Things are becoming more and more ugly every day.\nIndira tried in every possible way to speed up things. In India a bureaucracy exists which is only skillful in delaying things. In no other country does red-tapeism exist as much as it does in India. If you want to do a small thing it will take years. The bureaucracy is so long and it moves so slowly, with an ant’s pace. Indira was capable of seeing that if this goes on, nothing is possible. Hence the bureaucracy became angry. Nobody wants to work, and Indira was forcing them to work.\nThe masses became angry because things were going against their mind. They have always enjoyed many children, and they think this is a gift of God. Now this is a curse, no more a gift! Everybody boasts: “How many children I have got!” It is thought to be very manly to have many children – you are very productive. India knows only one kind of creativity! Nobody asks how many poems you have written, nobody asks how many paintings you have done, nobody asks such things; everybody asks, “How many children?” And when you can say, “Two dozen,” you are simply fantastic, great. That has been the only boast of the Indian male chauvinist. Now, he was very much hurt.\nAnd then, the bureaucracy was angry. They all joined together, and all kinds of opportunists.\nAll Indian political parties dropped their differences. Their differences are vast. They all dropped their differences because the real point always is how to attain to power. Who bothers about ideologies? They dropped all their ideologies; they have all gathered under the wing of Morarji Desai. Now this Morarji Desai and his party have no ideology, no plan. They simply want to be in power.\nAnd if you simply want to be in power, then you have to satisfy the masses the way they want to be satisfied – although their satisfactions are going to be suicidal. But who cares? Morarji Desai can remain the Prime Minister for at least five years; that is the real thing. Who bothers what is going to happen next century? That is not their business. Certainly Morarji Desai is not going to survive that\nlong even if he goes on drinking water of life. That is not his business. His whole business is how to remain in power.\nHe knows my attitude. I need this country to go through a great revolution. Indira is capable of it, Indira has all my blessings. That is the deep cause of why he is angry.\nI am really happy that Indira Gandhi is trying to contest again, to enter the Parliament. Once she is in the Parliament, it will not be too long that she remains out of power. It will be good that she be back in the Parliament. She is the only ray of hope, because she has guts. She can do things; she can risk. That’s what has happened: she risked all in trying to solve the problems that India is facing. She risked her Prime Ministership, she risked her life.\nBecause Morarji Desai knows this, he is, deep down, angry with me. His anger can be understood.\nBut he should say it directly. No need to beat around the bush. Say it directly. For that, you need not bring sex in; that is an indirect way, a cunning way, because he knows the Indian mind is very repressive: bring sex in, and the Indian masses are always with you – condemn sex and they are with you. Condemn life and they are with you, because that’s how they have been conditioned for centuries.\nAnd the Indian masses are very much against anybody declaring himself Bhagwan because then a great competition arises. This has always been so. Mohammedans don’t want anybody to declare that he is the prophet of God. Why? Because if he is the prophet of God, then he is the latest prophet of God: then Mohammed is just an antique model. Then Mohammed can be discarded. So they have decided that there will no more be any prophet of God; Mohammed is the last.\nWhy? Has God gone bankrupt since then? Has he abandoned humanity since then? Has he nothing to say to humanity again? He stopped with Mohammed? Why? Why didn’t he stop before?\nFor Christians he stopped before, with Christ; he is the only begotten son. But why didn’t he stop before Christ? He stopped for the Jainas, he stopped with Mahavira; he is the last teerthankara. And so on, so forth. Each religion wants his prophet, his teerthankara, his messiah, his godman, to be the last. So whenever somebody becomes the blessed one and declares it, all other religions will be against him.\nNow Christians are angry with me: I must be a false prophet, the devil incarnate, because Christ is the true Master. Jainas are against me because there is no possibility of anybody else becoming a teerthankara.\nI was born as a Jaina. The day I said I am the twenty-fifth teerthankara, they became angry. They said, “Twenty-fifth? But there is no mention of the twenty-fifth in the scriptures.” So I said, “We will write the scriptures again. How can they mention the twenty-fifth? The scriptures were written when the twenty-fourth was alive. Now we will write about the twenty-fifth – and I will make it a point that the twenty-sixth and twenty-seventh and so on, so forth, will be coming. God is not finished with me.”\nHow can God be finished? God is creativity. He will go on creating more and more Buddhas. They will be coming, they will be coming forever and ever.\nSo Morarji Desai brings in two things. The real thing he hides. Hmm? That is the way of a politician. But he brings in two other things, an indirect attack on me. First, he brings in sex. That is very easy to influence Indian masses with. Just to tell them that this man supports sex, is not against sex, is enough, enough condemnation: then he is against God, then he is irreligious, then he is materialist, he is earthy, and he is dangerous. Just mention one thing, that he is not unfavorable to the phenomenon of sex, and you have condemned him; now no other proof is needed.\nAnd then he brings in the second thing: Why does this man call himself God, or is called God by his disciples?\nDon’t blame my disciples. I call myself God. How can they call me God? What do they know about God? I take the total responsibility on my own.\nThat will anger Hindus because they will think, “So this man is trying to compete with our Rama and Krishna.” And that will anger Jainas because they will think, “He is trying to compete with our Mahavira and Adinath.” And this will anger Mohammedans and Christians and Parsees and Sikhas – and this will anger almost everybody in India!\nBut I don’t care.\nThe second question:\nQuestion 2\nSHREE BHAGWAN, I WANT TO KNOW THE MEANING OF AUM.\nM. D. Rajen, this is a very significant question.\nFirst, AUM is not a word, it is a pure sound, so it has no meaning as such. It is a pure sound, like the sound of a waterfall; what meaning has it? – no meaning at all. Or the sound of this aeroplane passing by; what meaning has it? – no meaning at all. The sound becomes a word when meaning becomes attached to it. A meaningful sound is a word; a meaningless word is a sound. So the first thing to be understood: AUM is not a word, it is pure sound. All other words have arisen out of it, but it itself is not a word. It is the source of all sounds; it cannot have any meaning whatsoever.\nThis sound AUM consists of three sounds: A, U, M. These are the seed sounds; all other sounds are created by A,U,M. All our words, the whole alphabet, is created by these three seed sounds: A,U,M. AUM is the source of all these three.\nThat’s why in India AUM is not written alphabetically. It has a symbol of its own. That is simply to designate: don’t be confused and don’t try to think about AUM as a word. AUM is the only sound in India which is not written alphabetically. It is written pictorially; it has a picture, a symbol, which is outside the alphabet. These are symbolic things. It has been kept outside the alphabet because it is the source. The source is always out, beyond, transcendental.\nAUM consists of three sounds and one anuswar. Anuswar is a very subtle sound; it represents a kind of humming. When you say, “AU”, that M prolonged, that humming sound that goes on reverberating,\nis the anuswar. Anuswar means just a dot; that too represents something. So AUM consists of four things: three visible, A,U,M, and the fourth invisible the rhythmic, humming shadow.\nThese four represent the whole of Indian metaphysics. “A” represents one state of the mind, when you are awake, the waking consciousness. “U” represents when you are dreaming, the dreaming consciousness. “M” represents when you are fast asleep, dreamlessly asleep – sushupti – deep, profound dreamless sleep. These are the three states of the human mind, human consciousness.\nAnd the anuswar, the dot – that humming sound that goes on reverberating – that represents the fourth, turiya, the transcendental state when you are neither asleep nor awake nor dreaming, when you are just a witness to all that is happening: the state of a Buddha or a Christ, the state where I am, where one can declare oneself Bhagwan.\nTuriya. The word “turiya” also means “the fourth”, simply “the fourth”. It has no other name, because it cannot be named. It is beyond names. This has to be understood first.\nAnd then the second thing: when you have reached the fourth state, turiya, when there is nothing but a melody heard, the celestial music – what Pythagoras has called the music of the heavens, the music of the stars, the music that is the very undercurrent of existence – when you have reached the fourth state of awakening, awareness, Buddhahood, you hear a music, a music which is not produced by any instrument.\nLet me remind you of the Zen Masters who tell their disciples to find the sound of one hand clapping. That is the music: one hand clapping. That is found only in the fourth. Why one hand clapping? You cannot produce music by one hand clapping; the clapping needs the other. Two are needed to tango, two are needed to clash, two are needed to create something. If a child is born, then two are needed, man and woman. Two are needed everywhere. Electricity needs the positive and the negative. Even life needs death as the opposite. So if you look into life, everything is dual; two are needed.\nBut beyond the two there is also a state, the transcendental, where two are not needed. It is called anahat naad: unstruck sound, one hand clapping. That sound is the very nature of existence. Existence is a subtle music – but it is heard only when you have reached the fourth state, when all thoughts have disappeared, where all unconsciousness has disappeared, where you are nothing but a pure mirror, mirroring nothing. Then suddenly explodes a melody.\nThat melody is called AUM. It is not a mantra, as you have been told. Please never use AUM as a mantra; don’t go on repeating, “AUM, AUM, AUM.” If you repeat it you will miss something; you\nwill become habitual.\nA man fell from a ten-story building. A professor was passing by with his student. Of course he must have been a professor of philosophy; he asked the student, “Look at the situation. The man has fallen from ten stories and he has not been hurt. What do you call it?”\nThe student said, “It is coincidence.”\nThe professor said, “Now, if he goes back again to the tenth story and falls and is not hurt, then what will you call it?”\nThe student said, “That will be fate. Once, it is coincidence, but if he goes again and falls, that will be fate.” And the professor said, “Okay. If he goes again, the third time, and falls from the tenth story, what will you call it?”\nThe student said, “Sir, then it will be habit. What else can it be?”\nIf you repeat AUM continuously, year in and year out, it will become your habit. It will become a subtle layer around you; it will prevent you from hearing the real AUM. The real AUM cannot be produced by you.\nThat’s why I am against the so-called transcendental meditation of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. It is very destructive. It is a lullaby; it only gives you good sleep, at the most. It can’t awaken you. It can cool you, it can give you a little calmness; it is good for people who are suffering from nervousness, tension, anxiety. It is a psychological device, it is a psychological drug – a non-medicinal tranquilizer. But it is not meditation, no. It is neither meditation nor transcendental; it is not at all. It simply soothes you, consoles you, helps you to go into good sleep.\nAnd it is not accidental that America has become very much interested in the so-called transcendental meditation of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, because America is suffering tremendously from insomnia. People have lost their sleep. They want sleep at any cost; they are ready to try anything. And transcendental meditation can help you to have a good sleep.\nBut meditation is just the opposite. Meditation is waking up. It is not a lullaby, it is diametrically the opposite. It is a shock, it shatters your sleep and your dreams. If you are a beggar, you are no more a beggar; it shatters the idea of your beggarhood. If you are a prime minister, you are no more a prime minister; it shatters your illusion of being a prime minister. It shatters all identities. It simply reveals one fact, that you are God. It only reveals your reality and takes all illusions away.\nAUM is not a mantra. So, Rajen, don’t use it as a mantra. It is a scientific formula, just like H2O. H2O is not water. You can go on repeating – when you are feeling thirsty you can sit and go on repeating – “H2O, H2O” – you can make a mantra out of it, and it may help you to fall asleep. Try, and you will be surprised: H2O can do the same as any mantra. Just try, “H2O, H2O” – sway with it – H2O, H2O – go on, go on, faster and faster and faster – and soon you will be transported into deep sleep.\nAnd when you awake, you will feel fresh, certainly fresh, but you will still be thirsty. It can’t help your thirst, it can’t quench you. And not that the formula is wrong, but a formula is not a mantra.\nAUM is the H2O of the spiritual transformation. It has all the secrets in it, but it is not something to be repeated. It has to be understood, so understand these things. First, AUM is not a word; it is a pure sound, the purest, the ultimate sound of existence. When all is gone, that sound remains. That is the sound of soundlessness, the sound of silence.\nAnd, symbolically, AUM represents your waking consciousness, your dreaming consciousness, your sleeping consciousness, and the beyond – the turiya – the fourth state, where one becomes Bhagwan, where one becomes Christ, Buddha, where one is one with totality. It is a tremendously important formula; it contains the whole metaphysics of the East. But it is not a mantra. Please\nnever repeat it. Repeating won’t help; it will deceive you. Try to understand it, and then start becoming more and more aware of your waking consciousness. Walking on the road, walk with full awareness, knowing that you are walking. Then slowly, slowly transform every act into awareness. De-automatize every act.\nA man came to me. He had been suffering from chain-smoking for thirty years; he was ill and the doctors said, “You will never be healthy if you don’t stop smoking.” But he was a chronic smoker; he could not help it. He had tried – not that he had not tried – he had tried hard, and he had suffered much in trying, but one day or two days, and then again the urge would come so tremendously, it would simply take him away. Again he would fall into the same pattern.\nBecause of this smoking he had lost all self-confidence: he knows he cannot do a small thing; he cannot stop smoking. He had become worthless in his own eyes; he thought himself just the most worthless person in the world. He had no respect for himself.\nHe came to me; he said, “What can I do? How can I stop smoking?” I said, “Nobody can stop smoking. You have to understand. Smoking is not only a question of your decision now. It has entered into your world of habits, it has taken roots. Thirty years is a long time. It has taken roots in your body, in your chemistry, it has spread all over. It is not just a question of your head deciding; your head cannot do anything. The head is impotent; it can start things, but it cannot stop so easily. Once you have started and once you have practiced so long, you are a great yogi – thirty years’ practicing smoking. It has become autonomous; you will have to de-automatize it.” He said, “What do you mean by ‘de-automatization’?”\nAnd that’s what meditation is all about: de-automatization.\nI said, “You do one thing: forget about stopping. There is no need either. For thirty years you have smoked and lived; of course it was a suffering, but you have become accustomed to that too. And what does it matter if you die a few hours earlier than you would have died without smoking? What are you going to do here? What have you done? So what is the point – whether you die Monday or Tuesday or Sunday, this year, that year – what does it matter?”\nHe said, “Yes, that is true, it doesn’t matter.” Then I said, “Forget about it; we are not going to stop it at all. Rather, we are going to understand it. So next time, you make it a meditation.”\nHe said, “Meditation out of smoking?” I said, “Yes. If Zen people can make meditation out of drinking tea, and can make it a ceremony, why not? Smoking can be as beautiful a meditation.”\nHe looked thrilled. He said, “What are you saying?” He became alive! He said, “Meditation? Just tell me – I cannot wait!”\nI gave him the meditation. I said, “Do one thing. When you take the packet out of your pocket, for a moment go slowly. When you are taking the packet of cigarettes out of your pocket move slowly. Enjoy it, there is no hurry. Be conscious, alert, aware; take it out slowly, with full awareness. Then take the cigarette out of the packet with full awareness, slowly – not in the old hurried way, unconscious way, mechanical way. Then start tapping the cigarette on your packet – but very alertly. Listen to the sound, just as Zen people do when the samovar starts singing and the tea starts boiling, and the aroma. Then smell the cigarette and the beauty of it.”\nHe said, “What are you saying? The beauty?” “Yes, it is beautiful. Tobacco is as divine as anything. Even Morarji Desai is divine, so why not tobacco? Smell it; it is God’s smell.”\nHe looked a little surprised. He said, “What, are you joking?” “No, I am not joking.” Even when I joke, I don’t joke. I am very serious.\n“Then put it in your mouth, with full awareness, light it with full awareness. Enjoy every act, small act, and divide it into as many small acts as possible, so you can become more and more aware.\n“Then have the first puff: God in the form of smoke. Hindus say,‘annam brahm’ – ’ Food is God.’ Why not smoke? All is God. Fill your lungs deeply – this is a pranayam. I am giving you the new yoga for the new age! Then release the smoke, relax, another puff... and go very slowly.\n“If you can do it, you will be surprised, soon you will see the whole stupidity of it. Not because others have said that it is stupid, not because others have said that it is bad: you will see it. And the seeing will not be just intellectual. It will be from your total being, it will be a vision of your totality. And then, one day, if it drops, it drops; if it continues, it continues. You need not worry about it.”\nAfter three months he came, and he said, “But it dropped.” “Now,” I said, “try it on other things too.”\nThis is the secret, the secret: de-automatize. Walking, walk slowly, watchfully. Looking, look watchfully, and you will see trees are greener than they have ever been and roses are rosier than they have ever been. Listen. Somebody is talking, gossiping: listen, listen attentively. When you are talking, talk attentively. Let your whole waking activity become de-automatized, and then you will be surprised, the moment it happens, your dream activity will have a new perspective. You will start becoming aware in your dream.\nThen start watching your dreams. That is a miracle when it happens. When you start watching your dreams you are really a totally different person. Then the dreams have no impact on you. Watching your dreams, one day dreams disappear; you have de-automatized your dreaming process. And then you will be able to watch your dreamless sleep: yoU are asleep, and you are still awake. The whole body sleeping, every cell of it relaxed, the whole mechanism silent – and you are watching there, a silent witness.\nWhen this third has happened, the fourth arises on its own: the humming sound. You are full of a new music. That music is God.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"9175","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_secret/part4/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_secret/>The Secret</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">4 I Declare Myself Bhagwan</h1><div class=post-meta>44 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;9175 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Secret/part4.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part3>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

SURAT, GUJARAT, ACCORDING, TO WHICH THE PRIME MINISTER, MORARJI DESAI,
SAID THAT HE HAD READ THE BOOK FROM SEX TO SUPERCONSCIOUSNESS BY ACHARYA
RAJNEESH AND FOUND IT INDECENT AND DISTASTEFUL. HE ALSO OBJECTED TO YOU
BEING CALLED BHAGWAN. OSHO, WOULD YOU PLEASE COMMENT ON IT?</p><p><br></p><p>Anand Maitreya, sex is a natural phenomenon, as natural as a rose
flower, or dewdrops on the grass leaves in the early morning. And it is
the most beautiful phenomenon too, as beautiful as the calling of a
cuckoo, as beautiful as the stars in the sky. But down the ages it has
been condemned.</p><p><br></p><p>Condemning sex has been one of the most important strategies to
dominate man. The moment you condemn sex you have condemned life itself.
Life arises out of sex; life is an expression of sex. If you can find
God anywhere, utterly present, it is the moment of sexual orgasm. But to
condemn sex is a great strategy. Through it you condemn man indirectly;
you poison his very source of being. And then he feels guilty, a sinner,
worthless; and then it is easy to dominate him, it is easy to manipulate
him, it is easy to exploit him – and that’s what the politicians and the
priests have been doing.</p><p><br></p><p>They don’t want you to have freedom, they don’t want you to enjoy
life, because the man who is blissful is rebellious. The man who is
enjoying his life cannot be easily dominated – it is very difficult to
dominate him – and cannot easily be deceived, because he has
clarity.</p><p>Shree Morarji Desai is a very repressed person as far as sex is
concerned. Now, this seems very strange. My discourses have been
collected in two hundred books, books on Vedanta, books on Tao, books on
Yoga, books on Sufism, books on the Upanishadas, books on the Geeta, the
Bible, the Tao Te Ching, but he has been reading only one book – FROM
SEX TO SUPERCONSCIOUSNESS. An eighty-three-year-old man, has remained
celibate for almost fifty years, why should he be interested in the book
FROM SEX TO SUPERCONSCIOUSNESS? Certainly he is not interested in
superconsciousness, because I have written two hundred books on
superconsciousness. His interest seems to be sex. That’s how it
happens.</p><p><br></p><p>I have read his autobiography. In his autobiography he remembers that
when young he went to see the Mother of Shree Aurobindo Ashram. She was
a beautiful woman. Before she came to Shree Aurobindo, she was an
actress; she had grace and a charisma of her own. And she was moving
deeply into spirituality. But what did Morarji Desai see in her? What he
saw shows much about him, not about the Mother.</p><p><br></p><p>The Mother’s disciples were coming to touch her feet, and sometimes a
disciple would get so ecstatic just by touching her feet that he would
start rolling, and sometimes his head would fall into the Mother’s lap.
And Morarji was horrified. He thought in his mind, “So that’s why they
are looking so ecstatic – just rolling in her lap. Her shapely,
beautiful thighs.” That’s what he saw. He went away – “This is not
spirituality. These people are sex obsessed. This is a vulgar expression
of sexuality.” That’s all that he saw in the Mother and the disciples;
he could not see anything more.</p><p><br></p><p>And that was when he was young. Now fifty years have passed, and
fifty years’ constant repression of sex has become a wound in him. He is
boiling within with sexuality.</p><p><br></p><p>When I read this question from Anand Maitreya I was reminded of a few
stories I would like to tell you.</p><p><br></p><p>“It is an outrage the way those nudists are carrying on in that
apartment,” the old woman told the policeman when he answered her call.
“I am ashamed.”</p><p><br></p><p>The cop looked out of the window and could see nothing but a vast
courtyard, a road, and an apartment building in the distance. “I can’t
see a thing,” he shrugged.</p><p><br></p><p>“Of course you can’t,” the old woman replied. “But just have a look
through these binoculars and you will see plenty.”</p><p><br></p><p>What he has seen in the book FROM SEX TO SUPERCONSCIOUSNESS is
nothing but his own mind reflected in it. There is nothing indecent, but
the very idea of sex creates in his mind the feeling of indecency. Maybe
the very word “sex” revives something in him that has been repressed,
that he has been sitting upon. The very word must be creating a ripple.
All those repressed feelings, instincts must be surfacing. That’s why he
thinks it is indecent. It depends on you.</p><p><br></p><p>There are people who go to Khajuraho and think it is indecent. It is
not. It is one of the most beautiful and one of the most spiritual
temples in the world. If you look into those stone statues, yes, there
are both things present, those statues represent the lowest and the
highest: they are from sex to superconsciousness. But the person who is
obsessed with sex – and all repressive persons are</p><p>obsessed – will not be able to see anything else other than the sex.
He will miss the real point. The real point is in the faces, in the eyes
turned upward, in those beautiful faces in which orgasmic ecstasy has
been sculptured. The stones have become sermons.</p><p><br></p><p>But it depends on how you have lived. Have you lived a life of
affirmation? Then you will be able to see. If you have lived a life of
negation, then it will be impossible for you to see.</p><p><br></p><p>An ancient Sufi parable:</p><p><br></p><p>Jalal, an old friend of Mulla Nasrudin’s, called one day. The Mulla
said, “I am delighted to see you after such a long time. I am just about
to start on a round of visits, however. Come, walk with me, and we can
talk.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Lend me a decent robe,” said Jalal, “because, as you see, I am not
dressed for visiting.” Nasrudin lent him a very fine robe.</p><p><br></p><p>At the first house Nasrudin presented his friend. “This is my old
companion, Jalal. But the robe he is wearing, that is mine!”</p><p><br></p><p>On their way to the next village, jalal said, “What a stupid thing to
say!‘The robe is mine’? Indeed! Don’t do it again.” Nasrudin
promised.</p><p><br></p><p>When they were comfortably seated at the next house, Nasrudin said,
“This is Jalal, an old friend, come to visit me. But the robe – the robe
is his!”</p><p><br></p><p>As they left, Jalal was just as annoyed as before. “Why did you say
that? Are you crazy?” “I only wanted to make amends. Now we are
quits.”</p><p>“If you do not mind,” said Jalal, slowly and carefully, “we shall not
say any more about the robe.” Nasrudin promised.</p><p><br></p><p>At the third and final place of call, Nasrudin slid, “May I present
Jalal, my friend. And the robe, the robe he is wearing.<span class=s4></span>But we must not say anything about the robe, must
we?”</p><p><br></p><p>Once you are trying to repress a thought, it comes up again and again
and again. Morarji Desai is not only obsessed with sex in this life, he
will remain obsessed even in coming lives. His whole approach is
unscientific, unnatural. He has not been able to understand what he is
doing. He has not been able to see that, how can sex be indecent?
Certainly he is not born out of a virgin mother. Certainly his children
are born out of his sexual relationship with his wife. But because of
his obsession he has even been very hard with his children.</p><p><br></p><p>One of his daughters committed suicide, and it is just because of his
obsessively puritan mind. He has been hard upon himself and hard upon
his children too.</p><p><br></p><p>The person who is obsessed with something unnatural is perverted. And
through this obsession he has lost all intelligence. Intelligence grows
out of being natural. Intelligence is a shadow of being</p><p>natural and spontaneous. The perverted person is bound to become
stupid because he is constantly fighting within himself. His whole
energy becomes a kind of civil war. The person who is fighting nature is
indecent, and the total outcome is stupidity.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t see any indecency in sex, because this is how God has chosen
to create life. Sex is his method. Just as a painter paints with his
brush, God has been creating this existence with sexual energy. To deny
SeX, to condemn sex, is to condemn God. If you call sex indecent you are
calling God indecent because this whole existence is nothing but an
expression of sexual energy.</p><p><br></p><p>These birds chirping, singing, do you think they are praising Prime
Minister Morarji Desai? This is sexual expression. The whole poetry of a
life consists of sexual energy. The whole beauty<span class=s4></span>What</p><p>is beauty? The very feeling that something is beautiful comes out of
sexual energy.</p><p><br></p><p>A woman looks beautiful to you. Why? Why does the call of the cuckoo
from the mango grove sound beautiful to you? Why? It is, deep down, an
expression of sex, love.</p><p><br></p><p>But the people like Morarji Desai live without love. In fact, a
politician cannot afford to be loving. He cannot live, he cannot love,
he cannot laugh.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard a story about him. I don’t know how far it is correct.
It is a joke – and jokes need not be correct, but they are always
true!</p><p><br></p><p>Morarji Desai was having his photograph taken by a press cameraman.
The photographer had a lot of trouble trying to get his subject to pose
properly. Eventually, after much bickering, he was about to take the
picture.</p><p><br></p><p>“Look pleasant for a moment,” said the photographer. “Then you can
resume your normal expression.”</p><p>He cannot laugh; laughter must be indecent. He cannot take life
playfully; playfulness must be indecent.</p><p><br></p><p>And this man has written a story on Krishna. Now the story is going
to be filmed. Not that he is a great author, but just because he is the
Prime Minister; so now the story is going to be filmed. I am puzzled,
surprised, at what he must be thinking about Krishna. His whole life
must be looking indecent to him because Krishna’s whole life is love,
playfulness, joy, celebration. What does Morarji Desai think about this
incident in Krishna’s life?</p><p><br></p><p>A few beautiful women were taking their bath in the Yamuna River. And
this is not a story of today. It is a story from when India used to be
alive, five thousand years ago, when India used to be really vibrant,
when people were courageous enough to love and laugh and dance, when
people were not life negative; but when life was thought to be God and
divine and people were not talking about life as if it is indecent.</p><p><br></p><p>Krishna passed by. The women were taking their bath naked in the
Yamuna River. Now no Indian woman will do it. Those days were beautiful;
people were more open. Now this can happen only in my ashram, nowhere
else. Krishna is still alive here.</p><p>Krishna saw those beautiful women swimming and floating in the water
and enjoying, and they were completely unaware of the presence of
Krishna. He gathered their clothes, which were on the bank, and climbed
a tree and sat there. When they were finished, those women looked
around; their clothes were gone. They started searching; then they saw
Krishna sitting in the tree with all the clothes with him.</p><p><br></p><p>Now what does Morarji Desai think about this? Certainly I have never
done anything like that! Krishna must look very indecent.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not that Krishna is indecent. It is just Morarji Desai’s sexual
perversion.</p><p><br></p><p>And he says that he found it distasteful. That too is strange. A man
who goes on drinking his own urine, and has not yet found it
distasteful.<span class=s4></span>And I am certainly certain that he
does not suffer from</p><p>diabetes – otherwise the urine may have a little sweetness.</p><p><br></p><p>He found the book distasteful? What taste has he got? What is he
talking about? What aesthetic sense has he got? He is the most unpoetic
person alive in this country.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard...</p><p><br></p><p>A gypsy and a hippie had an argument as to who could withstand foul
smell longer. They decided to remain with a skunk in a small pen. First
the gypsy went in. He ran out in desperation after a couple of minutes.
Then the hippie took his turn.</p><p><br></p><p>After a minute, the skunk bolted!</p><p><br></p><p>The gypsy was puzzled. He said, “How did you manage?”</p><p><br></p><p>The hippie said, “I am a follower of Morarji Desai. I live only on
garlic and water of life.” “Water of life” is a euphemism for your own
urine.</p><p>This man thinks that my book is distasteful? He is simply saying
something about himself, not about the book. It always depends on you,
how you interpret what you read. He must have read my book, but he must
have understood in his own way, he must have interpreted it in his own
way. The interpretation is indecent. What he has read into it is his own
mind.</p><p><br></p><p>If an ugly man faces a mirror, the mirror cannot be blamed for his
ugliness. And calling the mirror ugly won’t do.</p><p><br></p><p>The book FROM SEX TO SUPERCONSCIOUSNESS must have functioned as a
mirror. He must have become agitated because if that book is right, then
his whole life has been stupid and wasted stupidly. He must have felt
very antagonistic, hurt in his ego. His whole life he has been
struggling with sex, fighting with sex, and now here I am saying that
without a deep experience of sex you will never know love, and without a
deep experience of love you will never know prayer. And here I am saying
that sex is the first experience of God. And here I am saying that
without moving into life with totality you will never come to know the
innermost core of it.</p><p>Nothing has to be denied, because whatsoever is denied will take its
revenge. That’s what is happening to him. He is not angry at me; he is
angry at a mirror because the mirror is showing his face.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard, a very rich woman, but very ugly too, asked a great
painter, Goya, to make a portrait of her. Goya was hesitant, he wanted
to say no, but it was difficult. The woman was ready to pay any price.
He asked a very fantastic price, thinking that she would say no and he
could get out of it and there would be no need to paint this woman’s
face, but she said, “Yes, you start.” So he painted the portrait; it was
just a blob of colors. When the woman came, she said, “What? You have
not done a good job. Is this my portrait?” He said, “What can I do,
madam? I wanted to get out of it. Nature has not done a good job. What
can I do? I cannot improve upon nature. I am here just to paint you as
you are. That’s why I was very reluctant. I am just a mirror.”</p><p><br></p><p>I have received thousands of letters, from all kinds of people, that
they have been immensely benefited by the same book that Morarji Desai
says is indecent. But sex is on his mind too much.</p><p><br></p><p>A monk consulted a psychiatrist for help with various problems. The
analyst said, “Stretch out here on the couch. Just relax and tell me
about your early life. Just keep on talking. Say anything that comes to
mind.”</p><p><br></p><p>The monk proceeded to spill out his life story. Suddenly the analyst
took out a big balloon and sitting behind the patient, blew it up to
full size. Then he stuck a pin in it. The balloon burst with a loud
crash. The patient was startled. The doctor said sharply, “Now tell me,
quick, what did you think about when you heard the loud explosion?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I thought of sex.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sex? At such a moment? You thought about sex?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well,” said the patient, “what is so surprising about that? It is
all I ever think about.”</p><p><br></p><p>A monk is a monk, and a monk always thinks about sex. The more he
escapes from the world and its reality, the more and more he fantasizes
about it.</p><p><br></p><p>Morarji Desai has remained a monk. He has not known the beauties of
existence, and he is angry with me because my very presence makes him
aware that his life has been a wastage.</p><p><br></p><p>And the second thing you say, “He also objected to you being called
Bhagwan.”</p><p><br></p><p>I am Bhagwan, just as you are Bhagwan. Even Morarji Desai is a
Bhagwan. Bhagwan does not mean somebody sitting there high in the
heavens. Bhagwan simply means that which is hidden behind you, within
you, that which you are. I am Bhagwan because I have recognized it.</p><p><br></p><p>I am not calling myself Bhagwan. I am.</p><p><br></p><p>You are also, but you have not yet gathered courage to recognize the
fact. It needs guts to recognize your reality. It needs utter humbleness
to see things as they are. It needs simplicity of the heart to say
things as they are.</p><p>Morarji Desai is also a Bhagwan, just as everything else is, trees
and rocks and animals. God is not separate from existence; God is
immanent in it. Only God is. If only God is, then I am God, then you are
God, then everything is divine. But God can be fast asleep; that’s how
Morarji Desai is: a god fast asleep, dreaming that he has become the
Prime Minister, snoring.</p><p><br></p><p>Wake up.</p><p><br></p><p>But it is very difficult to wake up when you are a prime minister
because then one is afraid – if one wakes up and finds that it was only
a dream.<span class=s4></span>One has invested in the dream too
much.</p><p><br></p><p>“I had a dream the other night, Casey, an’ it taught me a great
lesson.” “Bedad, an’ what was the lisson, Pat?”</p><p>“‘Twas like this. I dreamed I wuz in Rome, an’ I had a audience with
the Pope – as great a gentleman as any in the district, an’ thot’s no
lie. Would I have a drink, he axed me. Thinks I, would a duck swim, an’
seein’ the whiskey an’ lemons an’sugar on the sideboard, I told him I
wouldn’t mind if I had a wee drop of punch.’Cold or hot?’ asked His
Riv’rence.’Hot, Yer Holiness,’ says I. Ah, what a mistake I made!”</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t see anything wrong –”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah, but listen, boy. His Holiness stepped toward the kitchen for the
b’ilin water, and before he got back, I woke up. Nex’ time, I’ll say,
I’ll take it cold Yer Holiness, while the water’s a-gettin’ hot!”</p><p><br></p><p>When you have a dream, a sweet dream, it is very difficult to listen
to people who are shouting, “Wake up!” That’s why it is very difficult
for people who have succeeded in life to wake up. Their very success
becomes their curse, They think they are doing perfectly well.</p><p><br></p><p>Have you not watched it in your dreams? If you are having a sweet
dream it continues; if you are having a nightmare it wakes you up. If
somebody is going to kill you and is just chasing you with a bayonet, a
moment comes when you simply wake up, perspiring of course, but you wake
up. A nightmare is good in that sense, that it wakes you up. But if you
are having a beautiful dream – you are Krishna, and all the beautiful
women of the world are dancing around you like your gopis, girlfriends –
who wants to wake up? One only hopes that this dream continues.</p><p><br></p><p>Morarji Desai is also as divine as I am, but God is fast asleep and
snoring.</p><p><br></p><p>Why should he be angry if I am being called Bhagwan? What has that to
do with him? But many people are angry, and the anger has some reason in
it. The reason is that if somebody is awakened, his very presence
disturbs your sleep. You cannot sleep as comfortably as before. Somebody
is awakened, so all that you are going into is a dream? You start
feeling annoyed with the person who is awake. You start finding reasons
that he must be wrong – “Why does he call himself God?”</p><p><br></p><p>And that too from an Indian looks very absurd. It’s okay if
Christians, Mohammedans, and Jews raise the question why I call myself
God, because they have no insight into the phenomenon as deeply as it
has happened in this country. Buddha never believed in God, never, but
still we called</p><p>him Bhagwan. Mahavira never believed in God; still we have called him
Bhagwan. So “Bhagwan” cannot be translated as “God”.</p><p><br></p><p>God is the creator of the world – and certainly I have not created
this world. I cannot take that responsibility, excuse me! I am not God
in the Christian sense.</p><p><br></p><p>But Morarji Desai is not a Christian. One can expect that he should
understand that Bhagwan in the East does not mean God. Bhagwan means
“the blessed one” – and I declare myself the blessed one. It simply
means that I have been blessed; that I have come to a point where I am
utterly content; that I have come to a state where I don’t desire
anything anymore, there is nothing to be desired, all is available; that
I have come to a state where mind is dissolved and I am one with
existence. This is the state of the blessed one.</p><p><br></p><p>Bhagwan simply means one who has disappeared as a person and has
become a presence. That’s why we could call Buddha Bhagwan, although he
never believed in God the Creator.</p><p><br></p><p>And there are people, like Morarji Desai, whose anger is this: that I
have declared it myself, that I am a self-appointed Bhagwan. But how
else can it be? How can it be otherwise? Who can appoint me Bhagwan?
Buddha declared himself; he was self-appointed, not that there was a
committee or a university senate or there was a vote in the country.</p><p><br></p><p>Politicians can’t think of anything else other than votes. He must be
thinking who has voted for me, how am I Bhagwan, how many people have
voted for and how many against.</p><p><br></p><p>Who had voted for Krishna? Who had voted for Mahavira and Buddha? Who
had voted for Christ? If Christ’s godhood depended on votes, he would
have lost his deposit! He had not more than a hundred disciples, not
more than that. And the real disciples were only twelve; the others were
just sympathizers. How did Jesus become Christ? Who appointed him? How
did Krishna declare, “I am that”? How did Buddha declare, “I have
arrived”? They were all self-appointed. There is no other way.</p><p><br></p><p>I have declared myself God. This is the only possible way, because
when I have become blessed, when I have known the ultimate joy of
experience, of existence, when I have seen truth, who else is needed to
certify it? Do I need a character certificate from the politicians? I
have declared it. There is nothing wrong, because that is the only way!
If you have known love, only you can say that you have known love.</p><p><br></p><p>I have known the ultimate samadhi, and only I can say it. And only a
few people, who have attained to that, will be able to recognize it.</p><p><br></p><p>Morarji Desai is simply saying that he cannot recognize it. But who
is expecting him to recognize it? He has not known anything of
meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>Just on the day he became Prime Minister, somebody asked him, “Are
all your desires fulfilled?” He said, “No, one desire is still there. I
want to know God.” The man said, “Then have you ever meditated?” – a
journalist must have asked. And Morarji Desai said, “I have not done
anything like meditation, although Acharya Rajneesh has given me a
meditation. But I could not do it, because I am too old and I cannot do
such a vigorous meditation as he suggested.”</p><p>Now, he is not too old to become the Prime Minister of a country like
India, which has only problems and problems and problems and nothing
else. And he is ten years older now than when I had talked to him and
given him a meditation. Then he was only seventy-three, now he is
eighty-three, but he says he is too old to meditate. But he is not too
old to become a prime minister of a country and to take the whole burden
of it.</p><p><br></p><p>Rationalization and nothing else. If you don’t want to meditate you
can always find reasons. Whatsoever you want to do, you are ready to do
it. He goes on running from one country to another country, he goes on
traveling all over the country, he goes on fighting with other
politicians, quarreling, and everything is done perfectly well; he has
enough energy for all that. Just for meditation, no energy. And this is
a twenty-four-hour job that he is doing, and meditation was to be done
only for one hour. But he says he is too old for meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>He has not known anything of meditation; how can he know anything of
what has happened in me, to me?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, I declare myself Bhagwan – because I declare this whole world is
Bhagwan. This whole world is blessed. If you don’t recognize the
blessings that are being showered on you by existence, that is your
responsibility; nobody else is responsible for it. I am open to all the
blessings. That’s all I mean when I say I am Bhagwan – that I have no
barriers, that I am in a state of let-go, that I am utterly open.
Whatsoever existence wants me to do I will do, and whatsoever the
existence does not want me to do I will not do. I am utterly
annihilated. Fana fi’llah: I am absorbed in God, in this totality;
that’s what I mean by the word “God”. And the moment this happened, fana
fi’llah, I became baka bi’llah, I became suddenly all. I am in the shape
of the tree. I am in the rays of the sun. Just as I am in this body, I
am in you too.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, this is my experience. I don’ t need any witnesses for it. Even
if the whole world says it is not so, it is still so. It does not depend
on you or your votes.</p><p><br></p><p>But the politicians can’t think of anything else; they only think of
votes.</p><p><br></p><p>But why should he be puzzled, worried about me? He goes on constantly
talking about me, as if I am haunting him.</p><p><br></p><p>He does not know what has happened to me and what can happen to him.
But he has read scriptures, he can quote scriptures; but all that that
he quotes is utterly borrowed! It is not his own.</p><p><br></p><p>A lady who owned a very intelligent parrot one day discovered a leaky
pipe in her kitchen. She called the plumber, but before he arrived she
had to leave the house momentarily on an errand. During her absence the
plumber came along and rang the doorbell.</p><p><br></p><p>“Who is it?” called the parrot. “It is the plumber,” he said.</p><p>“Who is it?” repeated the parrot.</p><p>“It is the plumber!” he shouted. “Who is it?” said the parrot.</p><p>“It is the PLUMBER! It is the PLUMBER!” he screamed, and in his
frustration he collapsed right on the doorstep with a heart attack.</p><p><br></p><p>On returning home, the lady found him lying there. “Good heavens,”
she said. “Who is it?” “It is the plumber,” said the parrot.</p><p>What Morarji Desai knows about scriptures is just parrot-like.</p><p><br></p><p>What I am saying to you has arisen in me. I am a witness to Buddha
and to Krishna and to Christ and to Zarathustra and to Lao Tzu and to
all those who have become awakened.</p><p><br></p><p>But his anger has, deep down, another reason too. Indira Gandhi has
always liked my thoughts; she has always been in a kind of love towards
my way of thinking. That is the deep root of why he is angry with me.
Indira has the intelligence to understand me, more than he has, and
Indira has a kind of receptivity and grace, and Indira also has guts and
the courage to take some revolutionary steps – which are utterly
needed.</p><p><br></p><p>It is because of her revolutionary steps that she lost the last
elections. The masses behave in a very suicidal way. The logic has to be
understood.</p><p><br></p><p>The masses are suffering because of a certain conditioning. It is
because of a certain mind that India has that India has suffered in the
past and is suffering now. Now, anything to change the situation, to
change this suffering, will basically need a change in the conditioning
of the masses. That is the problem. Everybody wants to get out of this
suffering state, this continuous starvation. People are ill, hungry,
dying, but if anything can change this situation, the first requirement
will be that we change our ways of thinking. And that is difficult for
the masses.</p><p><br></p><p>They have lived with a certain kind of mind, they have cherished that
mind for centuries, and they are utterly unaware that their mind is the
cause of their suffering. They want to change the outer situation, but
they are unaware that the outer situation exists in a certain
collaboration with their inner mind. So whenever somebody wants to
change the outer situation, their inner mind is going to be hurt and
wounded, and they will not be able to forgive such a person. That’s what
happened to Indira.</p><p><br></p><p>She really tried. She has been the most courageous prime minister
that India had in these past three decades. That was the problem, that
she started doing something really significant. But then the masses were
angry: their traditions were broken, their conditionings were
broken.</p><p><br></p><p>The masses were angry, and the politicians, the opportunists of this
country exploited the situation. But they have not been able to do
anything – they cannot do – because if they want to keep the masses
satisfied they have to agree with the mind, and if you agree with the
mind you cannot change the situation. This is the dilemma. The masses
will vote only for those people who follow the mind of the masses, but
then those people cannot do a thing; they will be utterly impotent.</p><p>That’s what has happened to Morarji Desai and his government. It is
utterly impotent. It has not been able to do a single thing. It cannot
do! And the reason is – the next election is coming close by every day –
if you do something that goes against the grain, you will be defeated.
They know perfectly well how they have come into power: they have come
into power because Indira tried to do something really
revolutionary.</p><p><br></p><p>She was trying to impose compulsory birth control on the country.
That is the only way it can be done. You cannot persuade the people, and
if you persuade, it will take thousands of years to persuade them, and
by that time there will be no point. In fact, this country has to have
birth control within twenty-five years, otherwise it is doomed; by the
end of this century it will not be possible for this country to exist at
all. Everybody will be hungry and starving and ill, there will be no
space left.</p><p><br></p><p>Things are in such a state that they can only be done compulsorily.
Birth control is the only way to prevent this population from growing,
and if you wait for the masses to understand and if you wait for them to
be educated, then it is not going to happen, ever.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what angered Indians. Hindus, Mohammedans, everybody was
angered. They thought their freedom was being taken away.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not a question of freedom or no freedom now. It is a question
of life and death! The country is moving every day towards the abyss.
Things are becoming more and more ugly every day.</p><p><br></p><p>Indira tried in every possible way to speed up things. In India a
bureaucracy exists which is only skillful in delaying things. In no
other country does red-tapeism exist as much as it does in India. If you
want to do a small thing it will take years. The bureaucracy is so long
and it moves so slowly, with an ant’s pace. Indira was capable of seeing
that if this goes on, nothing is possible. Hence the bureaucracy became
angry. Nobody wants to work, and Indira was forcing them to work.</p><p><br></p><p>The masses became angry because things were going against their mind.
They have always enjoyed many children, and they think this is a gift of
God. Now this is a curse, no more a gift! Everybody boasts: “How many
children I have got!” It is thought to be very manly to have many
children – you are very productive. India knows only one kind of
creativity! Nobody asks how many poems you have written, nobody asks how
many paintings you have done, nobody asks such things; everybody asks,
“How many children?” And when you can say, “Two dozen,” you are simply
fantastic, great. That has been the only boast of the Indian male
chauvinist. Now, he was very much hurt.</p><p><br></p><p>And then, the bureaucracy was angry. They all joined together, and
all kinds of opportunists.</p><p><br></p><p>All Indian political parties dropped their differences. Their
differences are vast. They all dropped their differences because the
real point always is how to attain to power. Who bothers about
ideologies? They dropped all their ideologies; they have all gathered
under the wing of Morarji Desai. Now this Morarji Desai and his party
have no ideology, no plan. They simply want to be in power.</p><p><br></p><p>And if you simply want to be in power, then you have to satisfy the
masses the way they want to be satisfied – although their satisfactions
are going to be suicidal. But who cares? Morarji Desai can remain the
Prime Minister for at least five years; that is the real thing. Who
bothers what is going to happen next century? That is not their
business. Certainly Morarji Desai is not going to survive that</p><p>long even if he goes on drinking water of life. That is not his
business. His whole business is how to remain in power.</p><p><br></p><p>He knows my attitude. I need this country to go through a great
revolution. Indira is capable of it, Indira has all my blessings. That
is the deep cause of why he is angry.</p><p><br></p><p>I am really happy that Indira Gandhi is trying to contest again, to
enter the Parliament. Once she is in the Parliament, it will not be too
long that she remains out of power. It will be good that she be back in
the Parliament. She is the only ray of hope, because she has guts. She
can do things; she can risk. That’s what has happened: she risked all in
trying to solve the problems that India is facing. She risked her Prime
Ministership, she risked her life.</p><p><br></p><p>Because Morarji Desai knows this, he is, deep down, angry with me.
His anger can be understood.</p><p><br></p><p>But he should say it directly. No need to beat around the bush. Say
it directly. For that, you need not bring sex in; that is an indirect
way, a cunning way, because he knows the Indian mind is very repressive:
bring sex in, and the Indian masses are always with you – condemn sex
and they are with you. Condemn life and they are with you, because
that’s how they have been conditioned for centuries.</p><p><br></p><p>And the Indian masses are very much against anybody declaring himself
Bhagwan because then a great competition arises. This has always been
so. Mohammedans don’t want anybody to declare that he is the prophet of
God. Why? Because if he is the prophet of God, then he is the latest
prophet of God: then Mohammed is just an antique model. Then Mohammed
can be discarded. So they have decided that there will no more be any
prophet of God; Mohammed is the last.</p><p><br></p><p>Why? Has God gone bankrupt since then? Has he abandoned humanity
since then? Has he nothing to say to humanity again? He stopped with
Mohammed? Why? Why didn’t he stop before?</p><p><br></p><p>For Christians he stopped before, with Christ; he is the only
begotten son. But why didn’t he stop before Christ? He stopped for the
Jainas, he stopped with Mahavira; he is the last teerthankara. And so
on, so forth. Each religion wants his prophet, his teerthankara, his
messiah, his godman, to be the last. So whenever somebody becomes the
blessed one and declares it, all other religions will be against
him.</p><p><br></p><p>Now Christians are angry with me: I must be a false prophet, the
devil incarnate, because Christ is the true Master. Jainas are against
me because there is no possibility of anybody else becoming a
teerthankara.</p><p><br></p><p>I was born as a Jaina. The day I said I am the twenty-fifth
teerthankara, they became angry. They said, “Twenty-fifth? But there is
no mention of the twenty-fifth in the scriptures.” So I said, “We will
write the scriptures again. How can they mention the twenty-fifth? The
scriptures were written when the twenty-fourth was alive. Now we will
write about the twenty-fifth – and I will make it a point that the
twenty-sixth and twenty-seventh and so on, so forth, will be coming. God
is not finished with me.”</p><p><br></p><p>How can God be finished? God is creativity. He will go on creating
more and more Buddhas. They will be coming, they will be coming forever
and ever.</p><p>So Morarji Desai brings in two things. The real thing he hides. Hmm?
That is the way of a politician. But he brings in two other things, an
indirect attack on me. First, he brings in sex. That is very easy to
influence Indian masses with. Just to tell them that this man supports
sex, is not against sex, is enough, enough condemnation: then he is
against God, then he is irreligious, then he is materialist, he is
earthy, and he is dangerous. Just mention one thing, that he is not
unfavorable to the phenomenon of sex, and you have condemned him; now no
other proof is needed.</p><p><br></p><p>And then he brings in the second thing: Why does this man call
himself God, or is called God by his disciples?</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t blame my disciples. I call myself God. How can they call me
God? What do they know about God? I take the total responsibility on my
own.</p><p><br></p><p>That will anger Hindus because they will think, “So this man is
trying to compete with our Rama and Krishna.” And that will anger Jainas
because they will think, “He is trying to compete with our Mahavira and
Adinath.” And this will anger Mohammedans and Christians and Parsees and
Sikhas – and this will anger almost everybody in India!</p><p><br></p><p>But I don’t care.</p><p><br></p><p>The second question:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2</p><p><br></p><p>SHREE BHAGWAN, I WANT TO KNOW THE MEANING OF AUM.</p><p><br></p><p>M. D. Rajen, this is a very significant question.</p><p><br></p><p>First, AUM is not a word, it is a pure sound, so it has no meaning as
such. It is a pure sound, like the sound of a waterfall; what meaning
has it? – no meaning at all. Or the sound of this aeroplane passing by;
what meaning has it? – no meaning at all. The sound becomes a word when
meaning becomes attached to it. A meaningful sound is a word; a
meaningless word is a sound. So the first thing to be understood: AUM is
not a word, it is pure sound. All other words have arisen out of it, but
it itself is not a word. It is the source of all sounds; it cannot have
any meaning whatsoever.</p><p><br></p><p>This sound AUM consists of three sounds: A, U, M. These are the seed
sounds; all other sounds are created by A,U,M. All our words, the whole
alphabet, is created by these three seed sounds: A,U,M. AUM is the
source of all these three.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why in India AUM is not written alphabetically. It has a
symbol of its own. That is simply to designate: don’t be confused and
don’t try to think about AUM as a word. AUM is the only sound in India
which is not written alphabetically. It is written pictorially; it has a
picture, a symbol, which is outside the alphabet. These are symbolic
things. It has been kept outside the alphabet because it is the source.
The source is always out, beyond, transcendental.</p><p><br></p><p>AUM consists of three sounds and one anuswar. Anuswar is a very
subtle sound; it represents a kind of humming. When you say, “AU”, that
M prolonged, that humming sound that goes on reverberating,</p><p>is the anuswar. Anuswar means just a dot; that too represents
something. So AUM consists of four things: three visible, A,U,M, and the
fourth invisible the rhythmic, humming shadow.</p><p><br></p><p>These four represent the whole of Indian metaphysics. “A” represents
one state of the mind, when you are awake, the waking consciousness. “U”
represents when you are dreaming, the dreaming consciousness. “M”
represents when you are fast asleep, dreamlessly asleep – sushupti –
deep, profound dreamless sleep. These are the three states of the human
mind, human consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>And the anuswar, the dot – that humming sound that goes on
reverberating – that represents the fourth, turiya, the transcendental
state when you are neither asleep nor awake nor dreaming, when you are
just a witness to all that is happening: the state of a Buddha or a
Christ, the state where I am, where one can declare oneself Bhagwan.</p><p><br></p><p>Turiya. The word “turiya” also means “the fourth”, simply “the
fourth”. It has no other name, because it cannot be named. It is beyond
names. This has to be understood first.</p><p><br></p><p>And then the second thing: when you have reached the fourth state,
turiya, when there is nothing but a melody heard, the celestial music –
what Pythagoras has called the music of the heavens, the music of the
stars, the music that is the very undercurrent of existence – when you
have reached the fourth state of awakening, awareness, Buddhahood, you
hear a music, a music which is not produced by any instrument.</p><p><br></p><p>Let me remind you of the Zen Masters who tell their disciples to find
the sound of one hand clapping. That is the music: one hand clapping.
That is found only in the fourth. Why one hand clapping? You cannot
produce music by one hand clapping; the clapping needs the other. Two
are needed to tango, two are needed to clash, two are needed to create
something. If a child is born, then two are needed, man and woman. Two
are needed everywhere. Electricity needs the positive and the negative.
Even life needs death as the opposite. So if you look into life,
everything is dual; two are needed.</p><p><br></p><p>But beyond the two there is also a state, the transcendental, where
two are not needed. It is called anahat naad: unstruck sound, one hand
clapping. That sound is the very nature of existence. Existence is a
subtle music – but it is heard only when you have reached the fourth
state, when all thoughts have disappeared, where all unconsciousness has
disappeared, where you are nothing but a pure mirror, mirroring nothing.
Then suddenly explodes a melody.</p><p><br></p><p>That melody is called AUM. It is not a mantra, as you have been told.
Please never use AUM as a mantra; don’t go on repeating, “AUM, AUM,
AUM.<span class=s4></span>” If you repeat it you will miss something;
you</p><p>will become habitual.</p><p><br></p><p>A man fell from a ten-story building. A professor was passing by with
his student. Of course he must have been a professor of philosophy; he
asked the student, “Look at the situation. The man has fallen from ten
stories and he has not been hurt. What do you call it?”</p><p><br></p><p>The student said, “It is coincidence.”</p><p><br></p><p>The professor said, “Now, if he goes back again to the tenth story
and falls and is not hurt, then what will you call it?”</p><p>The student said, “That will be fate. Once, it is coincidence, but if
he goes again and falls, that will be fate.” And the professor said,
“Okay. If he goes again, the third time, and falls from the tenth story,
what will you call it?”</p><p><br></p><p>The student said, “Sir, then it will be habit. What else can it
be?”</p><p><br></p><p>If you repeat AUM continuously, year in and year out, it will become
your habit. It will become a subtle layer around you; it will prevent
you from hearing the real AUM. The real AUM cannot be produced by
you.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why I am against the so-called transcendental meditation of
Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. It is very destructive. It is a lullaby; it only
gives you good sleep, at the most. It can’t awaken you. It can cool you,
it can give you a little calmness; it is good for people who are
suffering from nervousness, tension, anxiety. It is a psychological
device, it is a psychological drug – a non-medicinal tranquilizer. But
it is not meditation, no. It is neither meditation nor transcendental;
it is not at all. It simply soothes you, consoles you, helps you to go
into good sleep.</p><p><br></p><p>And it is not accidental that America has become very much interested
in the so-called transcendental meditation of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi,
because America is suffering tremendously from insomnia. People have
lost their sleep. They want sleep at any cost; they are ready to try
anything. And transcendental meditation can help you to have a good
sleep.</p><p><br></p><p>But meditation is just the opposite. Meditation is waking up. It is
not a lullaby, it is diametrically the opposite. It is a shock, it
shatters your sleep and your dreams. If you are a beggar, you are no
more a beggar; it shatters the idea of your beggarhood. If you are a
prime minister, you are no more a prime minister; it shatters your
illusion of being a prime minister. It shatters all identities. It
simply reveals one fact, that you are God. It only reveals your reality
and takes all illusions away.</p><p><br></p><p>AUM is not a mantra. So, Rajen, don’t use it as a mantra. It is a
scientific formula, just like H2O. H2O is not water. You can go on
repeating – when you are feeling thirsty you can sit and go on repeating
– “H2O, H2O” – you can make a mantra out of it, and it may help you to
fall asleep. Try, and you will be surprised: H2O can do the same as any
mantra. Just try, “H2O, H2O” – sway with it – H2O, H2O – go on, go on,
faster and faster and faster – and soon you will be transported into
deep sleep.</p><p><br></p><p>And when you awake, you will feel fresh, certainly fresh, but you
will still be thirsty. It can’t help your thirst, it can’t quench you.
And not that the formula is wrong, but a formula is not a mantra.</p><p><br></p><p>AUM is the H2O of the spiritual transformation. It has all the
secrets in it, but it is not something to be repeated. It has to be
understood, so understand these things. First, AUM is not a word; it is
a pure sound, the purest, the ultimate sound of existence. When all is
gone, that sound remains. That is the sound of soundlessness, the sound
of silence.</p><p><br></p><p>And, symbolically, AUM represents your waking consciousness, your
dreaming consciousness, your sleeping consciousness, and the beyond –
the turiya – the fourth state, where one becomes Bhagwan, where one
becomes Christ, Buddha, where one is one with totality. It is a
tremendously important formula; it contains the whole metaphysics of the
East. But it is not a mantra. Please</p><p>never repeat it. Repeating won’t help; it will deceive you. Try to
understand it, and then start becoming more and more aware of your
waking consciousness. Walking on the road, walk with full awareness,
knowing that you are walking. Then slowly, slowly transform every act
into awareness. De-automatize every act.</p><p><br></p><p>A man came to me. He had been suffering from chain-smoking for thirty
years; he was ill and the doctors said, “You will never be healthy if
you don’t stop smoking.” But he was a chronic smoker; he could not help
it. He had tried – not that he had not tried – he had tried hard, and he
had suffered much in trying, but one day or two days, and then again the
urge would come so tremendously, it would simply take him away. Again he
would fall into the same pattern.</p><p><br></p><p>Because of this smoking he had lost all self-confidence: he knows he
cannot do a small thing; he cannot stop smoking. He had become worthless
in his own eyes; he thought himself just the most worthless person in
the world. He had no respect for himself.</p><p><br></p><p>He came to me; he said, “What can I do? How can I stop smoking?” I
said, “Nobody can stop smoking. You have to understand. Smoking is not
only a question of your decision now. It has entered into your world of
habits, it has taken roots. Thirty years is a long time. It has taken
roots in your body, in your chemistry, it has spread all over. It is not
just a question of your head deciding; your head cannot do anything. The
head is impotent; it can start things, but it cannot stop so easily.
Once you have started and once you have practiced so long, you are a
great yogi – thirty years’ practicing smoking. It has become autonomous;
you will have to de-automatize it.” He said, “What do you mean by
‘de-automatization’?”</p><p><br></p><p>And that’s what meditation is all about: de-automatization.</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “You do one thing: forget about stopping. There is no need
either. For thirty years you have smoked and lived; of course it was a
suffering, but you have become accustomed to that too. And what does it
matter if you die a few hours earlier than you would have died without
smoking? What are you going to do here? What have you done? So what is
the point – whether you die Monday or Tuesday or Sunday, this year, that
year – what does it matter?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Yes, that is true, it doesn’t matter.” Then I said, “Forget
about it; we are not going to stop it at all. Rather, we are going to
understand it. So next time, you make it a meditation.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Meditation out of smoking?” I said, “Yes. If Zen people can
make meditation out of drinking tea, and can make it a ceremony, why
not? Smoking can be as beautiful a meditation.”</p><p><br></p><p>He looked thrilled. He said, “What are you saying?” He became alive!
He said, “Meditation? Just tell me – I cannot wait!”</p><p><br></p><p>I gave him the meditation. I said, “Do one thing. When you take the
packet out of your pocket, for a moment go slowly. When you are taking
the packet of cigarettes out of your pocket move slowly. Enjoy it, there
is no hurry. Be conscious, alert, aware; take it out slowly, with full
awareness. Then take the cigarette out of the packet with full
awareness, slowly – not in the old hurried way, unconscious way,
mechanical way. Then start tapping the cigarette on your packet – but
very alertly. Listen to the sound, just as Zen people do when the
samovar starts singing and the tea starts boiling, and the aroma. Then
smell the cigarette and the beauty of it.<span class=s4></span>”</p><p>He said, “What are you saying? The beauty?” “Yes, it is beautiful.
Tobacco is as divine as anything. Even Morarji Desai is divine, so why
not tobacco? Smell it; it is God’s smell.”</p><p><br></p><p>He looked a little surprised. He said, “What, are you joking?” “No, I
am not joking.” Even when I joke, I don’t joke. I am very serious.</p><p>“Then put it in your mouth, with full awareness, light it with full
awareness. Enjoy every act, small act, and divide it into as many small
acts as possible, so you can become more and more aware.</p><p><br></p><p>“Then have the first puff: God in the form of smoke. Hindus
say,‘annam brahm’ – ’ Food is God.’ Why not smoke? All is God. Fill your
lungs deeply – this is a pranayam. I am giving you the new yoga for the
new age! Then release the smoke, relax, another puff... and go very
slowly.</p><p><br></p><p>“If you can do it, you will be surprised, soon you will see the whole
stupidity of it. Not because others have said that it is stupid, not
because others have said that it is bad: you will see it. And the seeing
will not be just intellectual. It will be from your total being, it will
be a vision of your totality. And then, one day, if it drops, it drops;
if it continues, it continues. You need not worry about it.”</p><p><br></p><p>After three months he came, and he said, “But it dropped.” “Now,” I
said, “try it on other things too.”</p><p>This is the secret, the secret: de-automatize. Walking, walk slowly,
watchfully. Looking, look watchfully, and you will see trees are greener
than they have ever been and roses are rosier than they have ever been.
Listen. Somebody is talking, gossiping: listen, listen attentively. When
you are talking, talk attentively. Let your whole waking activity become
de-automatized, and then you will be surprised, the moment it happens,
your dream activity will have a new perspective. You will start becoming
aware in your dream.</p><p><br></p><p>Then start watching your dreams. That is a miracle when it happens.
When you start watching your dreams you are really a totally different
person. Then the dreams have no impact on you. Watching your dreams, one
day dreams disappear; you have de-automatized your dreaming process. And
then you will be able to watch your dreamless sleep: yoU are asleep, and
you are still awake. The whole body sleeping, every cell of it relaxed,
the whole mechanism silent – and you are watching there, a silent
witness.</p><p><br></p><p>When this third has happened, the fourth arises on its own: the
humming sound. You are full of a new music. That music is God.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part3>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

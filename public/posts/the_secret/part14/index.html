WHAT CAN I DO TO SHARE THIS SIGHT?\nAnand Buddha, God is not an experience. No experience as such is spiritual; all experiences are mind games. Beware of it. Whatsoever can be seen will be part of the illusory world. The seer is the truth, not the seen. You can see auras and you can see angels and you can see kundalini rising and you can see inner lights – but they are all seen. They are not you.\nThe seer is the witness, and only the witness is the truth. All else is a dream. And there are worldly dreams and there are other-worldly dreams; there are materialistic dreams and there are spiritualistic dreams. One thing has to be remembered always, that whatsoever is seen is worthless – even if it is God. The God that is seen is worthless.\nWhen all experiences disappear and you are left utterly alone, nothing to see, only emptiness in the hands, no experience at all, then suddenly you realize yourself. Then you turn upon yourself, then you fall into your source. And that is not an experience, it is a realization. That is the difference between the words “experience” and “realization”. It is not that you have seen something, experienced something. Now you know who you are.\nThe great Sufi mystic Maghrebi says,\nDon’t speak to us of visions and miracles, for we have long ago transcended such things. We saw them all to be illusion and dreams, and dauntlessly we passed beyond them.\nAnand Buddha, you will meet many people here who will go on playing these games. They are simply wasting their time. Avoid their company. I am going to attract all kinds of people, and particularly the people who are interested in spiritualism. They will bring all their diseases here. They will talk nonsense – they will talk about miracles, psychic experiences. And naturally, when somebody talks about such things, you start feeling as if you are missing. You are not missing a thing, because he is only dreaming.\nBut he can create this feeling in you, that you are lacking something, that your growth is not going well, that you are not growing as fast as you should grow. He will create in you the feeling of inferiority, and that is dangerous. Once you start feeling inferior you become sad, depressed, you carry a heavy weight on your chest; and that will become a hindrance in your growth.\nAnd every possibility is there that if you desire you will start seeing these things. Desire creates dreams. If you start thinking that you are missing, soon your mind will project. The mind is always ready to give you anything that you desire, and particularly such things. If you desire money it will be difficult because it is not only a question of your own mind. If you desire to become the president of a country it may not be easy because there may be much competition. But if you want to see auras there is no competition, and nobody can hinder you, and you are not taking somebody else’s auras; you are creating your own. It is a private, idiotic world. This is the meaning of the word “idiot”: it means having a private world of one’s own experiences which do not collaborate with reality.\nI know a few people are here; they enjoy a kind of leadership because they can gather a few people around themselves. They start talking about esoteric things. And whenever somebody talks about esoteric things, hidden truths that you are not aware of, he enjoys being a knower and he reduces you to an ignorant person. It hurts. Soon you will also start talking and reading such nonsense books, and they are available in abundance.\nHere, you are not to be with me to see auras, or to see lights, or to see kundalini energy rising, or the chakras opening. I am trying to hammer this truth into your heart continuously, that the only thing worth attaining is enlightenment, is nirvana, is the realization of who you are. Everything else has to be bypassed. And these things come on the way.\nThe mind tries to allure you to the very end. It gives beautiful psychedelic experiences, very colorful, enchanting. One can get stuck with them. LSD is nothing. If you go on working on your being you will find far deeper, far profounder-appearing experiences happening to you which no LSD can release.\nAnd then the desire is to cling to them, and that very desire keeps you away from the ultimate truth. For the ultimate truth, everything has to be sacrificed, all so-called spiritual experiences, esoteric knowledge, miracles. Everything has to be dropped. One has to come to the ultimate experience – which is not an experience.…\nLanguage is inadequate to express it; that’s why it is called an “experience”. It is not an experience, because in experience there is a division of the experiencer and the experienced, and in this\nexperience, the ultimate, there is no division. You are the knower, you are the known, you are the seer, you are the seen, you are the experiencer, you are the experienced – only you are.\nThat absolute, still point of pure existence, that is the goal. All else has to be sacrificed for it. Beware of such things.\nI have heard...\nA man was telling his friend about his recent trip to Europe and said, “You know, I went to Europe with my friend Seymour – you know Seymour, the cripple, the one with the crutches under each arm? Well, first we went to London where we visited the Tower of London. I climbed to the very top of it but poor Seymour, the cripple, the one with the crutches under each arm, he could not make it.\n“Then we went to Paris, France, where again I climbed to the top of the Eiffel Tower – but poor Seymour, the cripple, the one with the crutches under each arm, could not make it.\n“But then we went to Rome and ended up with a private audience with the Pope. The Pope walked into the room, took one look at Seymour, the cripple, the one with the crutches under each arm, and walked over to him and placed a kiss on the right cheek of Seymour. As if by magic, Seymour threw his right crutch away.\n“Then the Pope came over to Seymour’s left cheek and gave him a kiss – and again as if by magic, he threw his left crutch down.”\n“What happened next?” his friend asked.\n“Well, Seymour is a cripple, you know – he fell down right on his ass.” The second question:\nQuestion 2\nISN’T WHAT YOU SAY BEYOND THE BOUNDARIES OF HUMAN CAPACITIES?\nThere are no boundaries to human capacities. All boundaries are our beliefs; there are no boundaries. Man is part of infinity, and the part is equal to the whole – that is the law of higher mathematics. In the world of lower mathematics, the part is never equal to the whole, the part is smaller than the whole, obviously. In the world of higher mathematics, the part is equal to the whole, never smaller than the whole – because the part is the whole. Just as the whole contains the part, the part contains the whole. They are not separate at all, nowhere separate. No boundary divides the part from the whole. It is one reality seen in two ways.\nWhen you see the dewdrop, it is one way of seeing the ocean, that’s all, because the dewdrop contains all that the whole ocean contains. If one dewdrop is understood, if you have analyzed one dewdrop, you have known all the secrets of all the oceans, not only of this earth, but wherever the ocean exists, on other planets, on other earths. And scientists say there are at least fifty thousand planets where water exists, life exists. Wherever water exists, that one dewdrop has revealed to you\nthe whole secret of all possible oceans. Analyzing one dewdrop, you will come to the truth of H2O, and that contains all.\nMan is a dewdrop, man contains the whole. There are no boundaries.\nBut if you believe in boundaries then they are; your belief creates them. You are as big as you believe yourself to be – “As a man thinketh, so he is.” And if you don’t believe in anything, you are infinite, because no belief can be infinite. All beliefs are bound to be finite. The belief needs a definition; hence it will be finite – howsoever big, but it will still be finite.\nThat’s why I tell you again and again, drop all beliefs. In dropping beliefs you will be dropping all definitions, all boundaries, all limitations. When a person has dropped all beliefs, all thoughts, all desires, there is nothing to create the boundary. He is the whole.\nThat is the moment when Mansur shouted out of joy, “Ana el haq!” – I am the truth The third question:\nQuestion 3\nOSHO, IN A RECENT ARTICLE IN THE INTERNATIONAL HERALD TRIBUNE, WILLIAM BORDERS, A LONGTIME OBSERVER OF THIS COUNTRY FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES’ OFFICE IN NEW DELHI, WROTE OF HOW WE ARE AN EMBARRASSMENT TO “IMAGE- SHY INDIA”. WHAT IS IT ABOUT INDIA THAT MAKES INDIANS SO CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR INTERNATIONAL IMAGE? AND WHY CANNOT INDIA BE PROUD OF YOU? NEVER HAS THERE BEEN A RELIGIOUS LEADER IN HISTORY THAT HAS RECEIVED SO MUCH PUBLICITY ABROAD.\nKrishna Prem, India is a very poor country. It has nothing else to claim except its so-called spirituality. That’s its only ego. And each country needs a certain ego; otherwise the country need not exist. Each nation exists as an ego, and the ego needs some supports.\nThat’s why I am against all kinds of nationalism, because its root is ego. It divides people, it makes people fight each other. It creates antagonism, enmity. I am against all nationalism, against all nations.\nI would like to see one world where all these egos, the Indian and the Japanese and the German and the English and the French, have disappeared, because these are illnesses. The ego is like cancer, but even cancer needs something to feed upon; it cannot live on nothing. The ego needs something to nourish it.\nThe West can claim science, scientific knowledge, technology, great, beautiful Cities, good roads, aeroplanes, man’s reaching to the moon, and a thousand and one things. The West has many things to support its ego, India has nothing. It can only claim spirituality. And that’s its fear: that spirituality is also bogus.\nIt is very much afraid. If that spirituality is exposed as bogus, then it has nowhere to stand, no shelter; then it will fall flat on the ground. It respects, feels proud of, the people who go on claiming\nits spirituality and its spiritual greatness. It is proud of Vivekananda because he helps its ego to be strengthened. It is proud of Radhakrishnan. It is proud of Mahatma Gandhi. They all give support to its illusory idea of being spiritual.\nHow can it be proud of me? I am taking the last prop away from it. I am telling the world that this whole spirituality that India claims is bogus.\nYes, there have been a few spiritual people in India, as there have been everywhere. There is nothing to claim, nothing special to claim about it. Yes, Buddha has been here and Mahavira has been here and Krishna has been here. But so what? Lao Tzu and Chuang Tzu and Lieh Tzu have been in China; and Zarathustra and Moses and Ezekiel and John the Baptist and Jesus and Mohammed and Saint FrancisYou can go on counting hundreds of names from all over the world.\nIt is nothing special to India.\nThis land is in no way more spiritual than any other land, but then it hurts. Then there is nothing left to claim, and the Indian ego feels hurt.\nThey are angry with me because I am telling them, “Whatsoever you are claiming is just holy cow dung. You are not spiritual. In fact, you are only hypocrites – the greatest hypocrites in the world.”\nI have walked all over the country, from one corner to the other corner. I have watched the whole country very minutely. It is utterly materialistic, but it hides its materialism in a spiritual garb; and because of this spiritual claim, it cannot fulfill its materialist needs. And deep down it hankers for materialism, and on the surface it goes on pretending. India has that haughty look of holier-than- thou. It goes on believing that it has the claim to being the spiritual master of the whole world. It is all nonsense.\nSpiritual people have been everywhere, spiritual people will go on happening everywhere. No society is spiritual yet; only individuals are. No nation is spiritual yet.\nThat’s why, Krishna Prem, it cannot be proud of me.\nOnly one Western woman, Nivedita, had come with Vivekananda, and India was very proud. Now, thousands of women and men have come to me, but India cannot be proud of it. Why? I am not in any way supporting its chauvinistic claims.\nI am for one world. I am not an Indian and I am not a German and I am not a Chinese. I claim the whole world as mine, and I would like nations to disappear.\nAnd if India really feels it has some claim to being spiritual, then let India disappear first. That will be proof. Let India disappear as a nation; let it become an international land. That will be proof, concrete proof. But people go on talking about non-violence in India, and go on preparing for war. They go on talking about brotherhood and the unity of all religions, and just go on doing the opposite of it.\nBecause I am exposing things as they are, because I am functioning like an x-ray, they are angry. Nobody likes the x-ray, because it reveals your bones, your skeleton, your skull; and you have been\nthinking yourself so beautiful and all that comes out is just a skeleton? So this is you? You become angry, you become annoyed. Their annoyance with me is understandable. I perfectly understand it.\nIndia has lived for a thousand years under slavery. It has become very, very afraid of becoming a slave again. It knows that it has the capacity to become a slave at any moment. One thousand years of slavery is enough to prove to the country that somehow we are missing in some qualities. A great inferiority complex has arisen out of these one thousand years. And whenever a country or a man or a race suffers from an inferiority complex, it starts pretending to be superior. The superiority complex is a way to avoid one’s inferiority complex; that is a camouflage.\nThat’s what India is doing now. It wants to pretend, claim, prove to the world that we are spiritually very superior. It is afraid. It has nothing to claim. It is afraid, very much fearful inside, and out of that fear it has to create a very bold face on the outside. Deep down there is a trembling that every day the country is going more and more into darkness, more and more into poverty and starvation. The future is bleak; there seems to be no future.\nNow, how to avoid seeing this danger that is coming closer every moment? The only way is to look at the past: don’t look at the future, turn your back towards the future; look at the past. Talk of the golden days – ramrajya – when there were rivers of milk and butter and honey in the country – rivers – and the whole country was a golden bird. Delight in that fantasy! – which has no relevance to history, which has no truth in it. Yes, a few people have always been rich, but the major part of the country has always been poor.\nBut you can create your own past; nobody can prevent you. You can glory in your past; you can magnify it as big as you want. India delights in magnifying its past, in making it bigger and bigger, more and more golden – just to avoid the future that is coming every moment. And any moment it will grip the whole country.\nIt happens almost always: when a person is dying, he starts thinking of the old beautiful days of childhood just to avoid the death that is approaching. It is said that if somebody is drowning, he starts seeing his whole life revealed like a film. What really happens? He is dying; he is in pain, great anguish. He needs some consolation, he wants to forget about it all. Where to go? Except for the past, there is no other way. So India continuously goes into the past. When a nation is young it thinks of the future. When a nation is old and rotten it thinks of the past.\nAnd I go on continuously saying that the past that the Indians think they had, they never had. They only believe in it, it is their fantasy; they paint it. They go on saying that in the old ancient days the people were so good that there was no need to lock your houses. There was no stealing, no thieves, no robbers. This is all nonsense.\nThen to whom was Buddha saying “Don’t steal”? Then to whom was he teaching? To us? Twenty- five centuries before, he was talking to us? For forty-two years continuously, day in, day out, he was moving in the country and telling people, “Don’t steal. That is a great sin; you will suffer in hell. Don’t lie, otherwise you will suffer in hell. Don’t be violent. Don’t be jealous. Don’t murder. Don’t hurt. Don’t commit suicide.” To whom was he talking?\nAnd it is not only that Buddha was saying that. You can go as far back as possible; even in the Vedas the same teaching is available.\nWhen some teaching is there it means it had some relevance. Just as people are now, they were then. Buddha was not a madman, Mahavira was not a madman. If people were already non-violent, peaceful, loving, to whom were they talking about non-violence, who were they teaching? And it was not just once in a while. Their whole life they were doing only one thing: teaching people non-violence. People must have been utterly violent.\nThe moral teaching has not changed; it is the same as it was before. That simply means people are the same as they were before. People were as possessive, as desirous of things, as they are now. Certainly, they desired different things because those things were available to them. They could not have desired an aeroplane, that is true, but they all desired beautiful golden chariots, they desired beautiful palaces. It is the same. The object of the desire does not make any difference.\nAs far as I see, the ordinary man has always been the same. And as far as those few people who became enlightened are concerned, they have also always been the same. Buddha happening twenty-five centuries before or today; it is the same. And the unenlightened person of five thousand years before and of today is the same; there is no difference at all. There are only two kinds of people: the enlightened and the unenlightened. The unenlightened has persisted in his own way. The enlightened persons have always been the same wherever they have existed; their taste is the same.\nBut India is afraid of the future – which is coming with great speed. The population is growing every day. Each day brings more and more misery and more and more starvation, more and more people to be fed, clothed, sheltered. And people who are already here are starving. The future seems to be absolutely dark.\nNow what to do in such a situation? The easiest, although foolish, way – but the easiest – is to glorify the past, to keep yourself intoxicated with the past. Hence they are angry at me because I destroy their fantasies. I say if the future is coming and it is bleak, then it is better to see it. The sooner you do, the better, because something can still be done. And I don’t think that nothing is possible, but this ostrich-type mind which avoids seeing it will not be able to do a thing.\nI want that our eyes should be focused on the future. Forget the past; it is gone and gone forever and there is no point wasting time with it. Stop reading your scriptures parrot-like. Don’t go on continuously repeating the old, because it is not going to help in the future. For the future, you will need a new mind because the crisis that is coming on is so new, you will need a totally different approach.\nNobody wants to see it, and I would force people to see it, because the sooner it is looked into, the better. Something can still be done. I don’t think that it is impossible; I am not a pessimist. The situation is bad, but I am an optimist. I have hope that something can be done.\nAnd maybe these are the moments when countries change, when people change: when a crisis comes over, the very challenge can become a breakthrough. This opportunity has to be used.\nBut to face the future and not to be destroyed by it needs courage, needs intelligence, needs new orientations of the mind. That’s what I am trying to do. The Indian mind has to reorient itself.\nFor example, it should stop talking about distributing the wealth. There is no wealth to distribute. It should start creating wealth. How to create wealth? Open the doors of the country to all countries, to international sources of wealth, so they can start pouring in. For thirty years this country has been doing just the opposite: preventing foreign capital from coming into the country – afraid. Invite foreign capital, make every guarantee that their capital will be safe. And the whole world is interested because much capital is lying around the world uselessly. That capital needs to be used. But in the West, in fact, now there is no scope for spreading.\nIndia can become a really flowering country if the wealth pours in from all the sources. But it is very afraid. It is afraid of America; if American wealth comes in, it is afraid that we may be overpowered by it. There is no need to be afraid. America is not interested in overpowering any country politically. America’s whole interest is how to create more wealth for itself. You can create wealth for yourself and for America too; both will be benefited.\nBut this country has been following a foreign policy of remaining neutral, which is wrong. You need friends. If you remain neutral you will not have any friends. This country needs all the friends possible. Neutrality creates suspicion in people. That means you are with nobody and nobody wants to be with you. This country has become isolated; these thirty years the country has remained like an isolated part of the world, closed.\nOpen your doors. Let the wind and the sun and the rain come in. Open your doors. Invite Western technology to help you to develop. Let the wealth pour in from every nook and corner, and make it certain that their wealth will be secure.\nBut it is very much afraid: and the fear is that if you take help from others that again exposes your inferiority, so you have to do everything on your own. And this country has never been technological, so it has no technological mind. But you have to do it on your own. Even if you mess up everything you have to do it on your own, so you can keep a face in the world that “We are doing it on our own,” that “We don’t need anybody’s help.” This is an egoistic attitude.\nThis whole world now has to be interdependent. All ideas of independence and dependence are out of date. Forget about them. The world is now one organic unity; it is already one organic unity. Your nations are just fading realities, overshadowing the present and the future unnecessarily, just dead bodies, stinking. They have to be burned and thrown away.\nThis world now is one, and the question of dependence, independence does not arise. It is an interdependent world. Let this word become very significant; it is going to become significant in the future. The world is interdependent. There are a few things we can fulfill for others, there are a few things others can fulfill for us, and there is no question of ego involved.\nWe know the technology of the inner. If the West wants to understand about meditation, we can help. We can make them astronauts of the inner. But Indians trying to reach the moon on their own; it will never be possible, it is impossible.\nThe only way for the Indians to reach the moon will be to stand on each other’s shoulders and try!\nJust as the West is ignorant of the inner world, the East is ignorant of the outer world. We can combine. A great friendship is needed. You can watch; it has happened already.\nJapan is more affluent than it ever was. Just because of the Second World War, it came in contact with American technology. Now it is one of the richest countries of the world. In the East it is the richest. It has happened very illogically, because a country is destroyed in a war, and Japan was the first country in human history that was utterly devastated and destroyed. The atom bomb was tried on it. But out of that destruction Japan was born, a new Japan was born. America has helped it technologically.\nAnd that has been the case in Germany too. The part that has come under American influence has become very rich, one of the richest countries in the world, and the part that has gone to the communist bloc remains as poor as ever.\nI have heard, a Jew suggested in the Jewish parliament, “The only way for us to become rich is to declare war against America.” Now, Israel declaring war against America – the whole parliament laughed. “Have you gone mad?” they said. “How can we win?” The man said, “There is no need to win. If we are defeated, then American technology will be available just as it has been available to Japan and Germany. If we are defeated, we will become the richest country in the world. And by chance, by luck, if we are not defeated and we become the winners, then certainly we will be the richest country in the world. So we have nothing to lose either way. If we win, we win; if we are defeated, then too we are victorious.”\nIndia needs Western technology, and India needs to be aware that you cannot become rich on your own. You don’t know how. For five thousand years you have become accustomed to poverty. You have taken it for granted; it has become your way of life. You have even started praising it. You think to be poor is somehow spiritual, to be ill is somehow spiritual.\nIt happens, when a country has remained poor for thousands of years, it starts claiming something special in its poverty. It happens to you individually too. If a man is poor and cannot get rich, he starts bragging, “I don’t want to become rich ‘the grapes are sour’ – who bothers to become rich? I am happy in my poverty; poverty has something special in it. In fact, you are missing something; I am not missing.” These are the rationalizations.\nI would like to see India holding hands with the West in deep friendship, helping them towards the inner search, which is becoming more and more passionate every day in the West, which always becomes so whenever a country becomes affluent.\nNow the West wants to know “Who am I?” We have all the technology for it. For five thousand years we have done only that and nothing else. We can release a new energy, a new impetus and momentum, to spiritual growth; just as the West can release a great energy to the East for materialistic growth.\nBut for that you will have to drop your stupid anti-materialistic attitudes. You will have to come down to the earth. You will have to become earthy, sensuous, intelligent.\nI teach a sensuous religion. That’s why Indians are against me. I teach an earthy religion, rooted in the earth. Yes, raise your branches into the sky, let your flowers bloom into the clouds, but get your roots deep into the earth; otherwise there will be no flowering. A real religion cannot be only af the sky, and it cannot be only of the earth. A real religion is always a meeting of the earth and the sky.\nI am a meeting of the earth and the sky, and that is the problem. They cannot be proud of me; they think I am a Charvaka, a materialist like Epicurus, that my philosophy is of “Eat, drink, and be merry.” Yes, that too is part of my philosophy, but just a part. I am not against eating, drinking, and merrying. Eat, drink, and be merry – but that’s not all. When you have eaten enough, and drunk enough, and you have “merried” enough, then something higher is waiting. And only then is something higher possible. When the earthly part in you is satisfied, contented, then the sky claims you, then the unknown. claims you, then begins the real pilgrimage of the soul.\nI am earthy. I teach a sensuous religion, a religion which is not against the body, which is not against matter, which is not against the world. My religion is big enough – it contains all. It is inclusive, it includes all. It does not exclude anything. It is as inclusive as God himself.\nGod includes all, certainly. The earth must be in God, otherwise how can the earth exist? And God must be in the earth, otherwise how can the earth remain alive?\nI am teaching a new religion because, in the old days, India became hung up too much in the sky, with the clouds; it forgot how to grow roots in the earth. It becomes angry, it is annoyed, it cannot be proud of me. I appear to be an enemy who is going to destroy its great tradition, as if I am against its spirituality. I am not, but the spirituality is possible only if it is based, founded, in a scientific materialism.\nAnd you ask, Krishna Prem, why it is so “image-shy”, It is so image-shy because it knows its hypocrisies. Only a hypocrite is image-shy. The true person never is. The true person can stand naked under the sun, he is available, he has nothing to fear. He is as he is; he has never pretended otherwise. But a person who pretends is always afraid because his image is false. He is afraid: if somebody looks deeper, comes closer, then the image will be gone, then the reality will be found; and the reality is just the contrary.\nOnly the hypocrite is afraid of being found out. India is very much afraid – afraid that its image can be shattered very easily. It is a very poor, impotent image that can be shattered so easily. It seems it has no soul, no vitality in it. When you are true you are ready and available. You need not be worried. You are rooted in your being; you trust yourself. India does not trust itself; that’s why it is afraid.\nJust think – I am only one of my type. India has thousands of “mahatmas”. They are afraid I will destroy their in age, and what are your thousands and thousands of mahatmas doing? They are creating your image. Thousands of mahatmas are creating, and only one madman is destroying it; why are you afraid? How can I destroy it?\nBut they know that even those thousands creating the image can be defeated by a single person because their image is just a dream. It is not true, it is not real. They are too apprehensive. If the world comes to know the reality of the Indian mind, then what will happen to their bragging, that they have been doing down the ages, that “We are the most spiritual people of the world”?\nWhy should you be afraid? Why should one single man like me be feared? But the reason is clear: when truth is there it can destroy the lies. Even if the lies are repeated by millions of people, a single truth is enough to shatter those lies. Otherwise give me freedom as you have given freedom to your\nother mahatmas. Let me do my experiment, you go on doing your experiment, and whosoever is true is going to win. Why be so afraid? If I am untrue, my untruth will undo me. If you are true, you will win.\nThe Indian government has its motto: Satyamew Jayate – Truth Is Always Victorious. Then why be afraid? Truth will be victorious.\nJust the other day, Neervana received a letter from the Indian embassy in America. He had applied for a visa. The letter has refused the visa, and the reason given is that “If you had asked for the visa to visit and stay in some institution other than the Rajneesh Ashram, you would have got it, but we cannot give it to you for this. You have asked to stay in a wrong kind of institution.”\nSatyamew Jayate – Truth Is Always Victorious.\nWhy are you so afraid? Let people come and see. It is better that they come and see the untruth of my being, and then they will not come to me at all.\nAnd you have thousands of other institutions which are supported by the government, which are supported by the masses. I am not supported by anybody. Neither do the masses support me nor does the government. I am not supported by anybody; I exist on my own. My people exist on their own. We don’t live on anybody’s charity.\nWhy be afraid of us? But the reason is there: even a small ray of truth is enough to destroy the whole ocean of darkness.\nThe fourth question:\nQuestion 4\nOSHO, WHY ARE YOU SO HARD ON POLITICIANS?\nI will tell you a story. That will be my answer.\nA man bought a very well-bred and expensive young donkey, but upon his return home with it, found it resisted all his efforts to saddle it, let alone carry his goods. Finally, in frustration, he took it to a donkey-trainer of some renown.\n“This hayburner cost me a packet and won’t do a damn thing. You reckon you can help?”\nWithout answering, the trainer seized a length of 3 x 2 and smote the beast squarely between the eyes, knocking it back on its haunches.\n“A thousand bloody dollars and you attack it with a Piece of wood?” shrieked the distraught owner.\n“Listen,” replied the other calmly, “when you are dealing with a donkey, the first thing you gotta do is get his attention.”\nThe fifth question:\nQuestion 5\nI FREQUENTLY HEAR YOU SPEAK ABOUT REBELLION. THE PRIESTS AND NUNS AND RELATIVES THAT SHAPED MY TRAINING ARE NOW OLD AND DRIED UP. MOST ARE DEAD. IT SEEMS WORTHLESS TO REBEL AGAINST THOSE HELPLESS OLD PEOPLE.\nI AM NOW THE PRIEST AND THE DOCTRINES. I FEEL THAT TO REBEL AGAINST ANYTHING OUTSIDE MYSELF IS A WASTE OF TIME AND JUST SIMPLY NOT TO THE POINT. THIS MAKES THE SITUATION MUCH MORE FRUSTRATING AND ENTANGLED. IT SEEMS THE SELF MUST REBEL AGAINST THE SELF. I ACCEPT THAT IT IS NOT THE ESSENTIAL SELF – THE ORIGINAL FACE – THAT HAS TO DO THE REBELLING. IT IS THE TRAINED SELF – THE SUBTERFUGE. BUT THAT IS THE ONLY “SELF” I HAVE OR KNOW WITH WHICH TO DO THE REBELLING. HOW DOES THE SUBTERFUGE REBEL AGAINST THE SUBTERFUGE?\nPremananda, the rebellion I am talking about is not to be done against anybody. It is not really a rebellion, but only an understanding. You are not to fight with the outer priests, nuns, parents, no. And you are not to fight, either, with the inner priests, nuns, parents. Because outer or inner, it doesn’t matter, they are separate from you. The outer is separate, the inner too is separate. The inner is only the reflection of the outer.\nYou are perfectly right in saying, “It seems worthless to rebel against those helpless old people.” I am not telling you to rebel against those old, helpless people. And I am not telling you, either, to rebel against all that they have put inside you. If you rebel against your own mind it will be a reaction, not a rebellion. Note the difference. A reaction is out of anger; a reaction is violent. In a reaction you become blind with rage. In a reaction you start moving to the other extreme.\nFor example, if your parents have been teaching you to be clean and take a bath every day, and this and that, and you have been taught from the very beginning that cleanliness is next to God, and one day you start rebelling, what will you do? You will stop taking a bath. You will start living in filth.\nThat’s what hippies go on doing all over the world. They think this is rebellion. Now they have moved to the other extreme. They were taught cleanliness is next to God; now they are thinking that filthiness is next to God, dirtiness is next to God. From one extreme they have moved to the other. This is not rebellion. This is rage, this is anger, this is revenge.\nAnd while reacting to your parents and their so-called ideas of cleanliness, you are still attached to the same idea. It is still haunting you, it is still powerful over you, it is still dominant, it is still decisive. It still decides your life, although you have become the opposite of it; but it decides. You cannot take a bath easily; you are reminded of your parents who used to force you to take a bath every day. Now you don’t take a bath at all.\nWho is dominating you? Your parents, still. Still, what they have done to you, you have not been able to undo. This is reaction, this is not rebellion.\nThen what is rebellion? Rebellion is pure understanding. You simply understand what is the case. Then you are no more neurotically obsessed with cleanliness, that’s all. You don’t become unclean. Cleanliness has its own beauty. One should not be obsessed by it, because obsession is ill.\nFor example, a person continuously washing his hands the whole day – then he is neurotic. Washing of the hands is not bad, but just washing your hands the whole day is mad. But from washing your hands the whole day, if you move to non-washing, you stop washing forever, then again you are trapped in another kind of madness, the opposite kind.\nThe man of understanding washes his hands when it is needed. When it is not needed, he is not obsessed with it. He is simply natural, spontaneous about it. He lives intelligently, that’s all.\nFor example, there is not much difference in obsession and intelligence if you don’t watch very minutely. If you come across a snake on the road and you jump, naturally you jump out of fear. But this fear is intelligence. If you are unintelligent, stupid, then you will not jump out of the way and you will unnecessarily invite danger into your life. The intelligent person will jump immediately – the snake is there. It is out of fear, but this fear is intelligent, positive, life-serving.\nBut this fear can become obsessive. For example, you cannot sit in a house. Who knows? It may fall. And houses have been known to fall, that is true. Sometimes they have fallen; you are not absolutely wrong. You can argue that, “If other houses have fallen, why not this?” Now you are afraid to live under any roof – it may fall. This is obsession. Now it is becoming unintelligent.\nIt is good to be aware that you eat clean food. But I know a man, a great poet.Once he traveled\nwith me. His wife told me, “Now you will know how difficult it is to live with this man.” I said, “What is the matter?” She said, “You will know yourself.” He would not drink any tea, any water, anywhere. It was so difficult, because he would say, “Who knows, if there are germs in the tea or the water?” He would not eat in any hotel. It was such a problem. And we had to travel for thirty-six hours in the train, and he was starving and thirsty and he would not drink water.\nI tried in every way to persuade him. He said, “No. Who knows, if there are germs, then? It is better,” he said, “to starve for thirty-six hours and not to eat. I am not going to die; don’t be worried.” But I could see the man was torturing himself. It was hot summer and he was thirsty. And I tried in every station – I brought soda, I brought Coca-Cola, and everything. He said, “Forget all about it – I cannot take anything unless I am absolutely certain. What is the certainty? What is the guarantee?”\nAnd he is not absolutely wrong, that is true. You know India, and you know Indian stations and Indian hotels. You know. He is right, but now this is carrying the logic too far.\nThen I told him, “Stop breathing too!” He said, “Why?” I said, “Who knows, what is the guarantee? Stop breathing! Either drink this water or stop breathing!” Then he was brought to his senses, because I was really angry. “Why do you go on breathing? Who knows, there may be germs, there are germs everywhere.”\nHe drank a cup of tea, but the way he drank! His face... I cannot forget. It has been ten years by now, but I cannot forget his face – as if I was killing him! I was murderous! And he was obliging me!\nAnd at the next station, he got down and he said, “I cannot travel with you; I will go back home.” I said, “What is the matter?” He said, “You were so angry, and it seemed that you would start beating me or something. And you said,‘Don’t breathe anymore.’ How can I stop breathing?” I said, “I was just giving you an argument, that if you can breathe, then why not drink the water? It is the same Indian water as the Indian air. Don’t be worried.”\nHe refused to travel with me. I had to travel alone. He went back, and since then I have not seen him.\nOne can become obsessive about anything. Anything that may be intelligent within boundaries may become neurotic if you stretch it too far. Reaction is moving to the other extreme. Rebellion is a very deep understanding, profound understanding, of a certain phenomenon. And rebellion always keeps you in the middle; it gives you balance.\nYou are not to fight with anybody, the nuns and the priests and the parents, outside or inner. You are not to fight with anybody, because in a fight you will not know where to stop. In a fight one loses awareness; in a fight one starts moving to the extreme. You can watch it.\nFor example, just sitting with your friends, by the way, you say, “That movie I went to yesterday was not worth seeing.” You may have mentioned it just by the way, but then somebody says, “You are wrong. I have also seen the movie. It is one of the most beautiful pictures ever made.” Now you are provoked, challenged; you become argumentative. You say, “It is worthless, the most worthless thing!” And you start criticizing. And if the other also insists, you become more and more angry and you start saying things you have not even thought about. And later on if you go backwards and see the whole phenomenon that had happened, you will be surprised that when you had mentioned that it was not worth going to, it was a very mild statement, but by the time you finished with the argument, you had moved to the extreme. You had used all that was possible, all the nasty words that you know. You could condemn in any way; you used all your skill of condemnation. And you were not ready to do it in the beginning. If nobody had opposed you, you might have forgotten all about it, you might never have made such strong statements.\nIt happens – when you start fighting you tend to move to the extreme.\nI am not teaching you to fight with your conditionings. Understand them. Become more intelligent about them. Just see how they dominate you, how they influence your behavior, how they have shaped your personality, how they go on affecting you from the back door. Just watch! Be meditative. And one day, when you have seen the working of your conditionings, suddenly a balance is attained. In your very understanding you are free.\nUnderstanding is freedom, and that freedom I call rebellion.\nThe real rebel is not a fighter; he is a man of understanding. He simply grows in intelligence, not in anger, not in rage. You cannot transform yourself by being angry against your past. Then the past will continue to dominate you, then the past will remain the center of your being, the past will remain your focus. You will remain focused, attached to the past. You may move to the very other extreme, but still you will be attached to the past.\nBeware of it! That is not the way of a meditator; that is not the way of a sannyasin. Sannyas is rebellion – rebellion through understanding. Just understand.\nYou pass by the side of a church and a deep desire arises in you to go inside and pray. Or you pass by the side of a temple and unconsciously you bow down to the deity of the temple. Just watch. Why are you doing these things? I am not saying to fight. I am saying to watch. Why do you bow\ndown to the temple? – because you were taught that this temple is the right temple, that the deity of this temple is the real image of God. Do you know? Or have you just been told and you have been following it? Watch!\nSeeing it, that you are just repeating a program that has been given to you, that you are just playing a tape in your head, that you are being automatic, robot-like, you will stop bowing. Not that you will have to make any effort, you will simply forget all about it. It will disappear, it will leave you without any trace.\nIn reaction the trace is there. In rebellion there is no trace; it is utter freedom.\nAnd you also ask, Premananda, “Who is to fight with whom?” Hmm? That question arises only if it has to be a fight. Because it is not going to be a fight, the question does not arise.\nYou have just to be a witness. And the witnessing is your original face; the one who witnesses is your real consciousness. That which is witnessed is conditioning. The one who witnesses is the divine source of your being.\nThe sixth question:\nQuestion 6\nI WANT TO GIVE BIRTH TO A BUDDHA. THAT’S MY ONLY DESIRE IN LIFE, TO BECOME THE MOTHER OF A BUDDHA. OSHO, IS IT POSSIBLE?\nFirst become a Buddha; then maybe a Buddha is born out of you. But the desire to give birth to a Buddha is utterly futile. That is again an ego trip, that “I should become the mother of a Buddha.” The very desire will be the hindrance.\nYes, you can become a mother of a Buddha, but the first requirement is :YOU become a Buddha. And it has also happened that a Buddha is born to a woman who is not a Buddha. But one thing is certain: she was not desiring. She may not have been a Buddha, but she was not desiring a Buddha. Buddha can be born to a woman if there is no desire, if the woman is innocent. Desire makes you cunning.\nNow this desire is again an ambition. Somebody wants to become the president of a country, somebody wants to be the richest man in the world – you want to become the mother of a Buddha. Why?\nAll becoming, all desire for the future, is an extension of the ego. And if there is such a desire, it will destroy your whole life. And then it is futile too, because I have never heard, it is not reported anywhere in any scripture of the world, that a woman wanted to give birth to a Buddha and she succeeded.\nBuddhas were born, but they were born to women who were completely innocent, unaware. If you deliberately want to do it, there is no possibility.\nBecome meditative, become more silent, more still, more loving, more compassionate. Befriend existence, trust life, live in the moment, and then whatsoever happens is good. If God wills a Buddha through you, good; if he does not will a Buddha through you, that too is perfectly good.\nAnd even if a child born to you-becomes a Buddha, how is it going to help you? How is it going to make you free? It is not going to help you at all; you will remain in the same rut. You will go on moving in the same vicious circle of life and death. Gautam Buddha’s mother has not yet become a Buddha; Mahavira’s mother is still moving in the same vicious circle, has not yet attained, so that is not going to help you in any way.\nAnd remember, when a soul enters into a woman’s womb, it can enter only if the womb is suitable for it, if the womb somehow is harmonious with the rhythm of the soul. To give birth to an Adolf Hitler a different kind of mother is needed; to give birth to a Buddha, certainly a different kind of mother is needed, because the womb attracts only something harmonious to it, and the soul – a higher soul – can enter only in a higher womb.\nDrop all these desires. Start becoming a Buddha on your own. And then it is possible, because Buddhas after all need wombs. And nothing is wrong with your womb, but create a holy womb. Remember always the old proverb, “The tree is known by the fruit.” Only a mango tree can give mango fruits. You can know about the tree by the fruits. You cannot give birth to something which you are not.\nI have heard:\nAn elderly widower had himself fitted out with a full set of monkey glands, and a short while later remarried.\nA year passed, and the night was an eventful one. Outside the bedroom door paced up and down, up and down, the rejuvenated husband. At last a door opened and the nurse appeared, but before the man could stop her she had brushed past and was on her way downstairs. After a time the doctor came out.\n“Oh, tell me, doctor, tell me,” exclaimed the anxious husband, “is it a boy or a girl?” “We don’t know yet,” answered the doctor.\n“Don’t know yet?”\n“No, we have not been able to get the little devil down off the chandelier.” Now when you are fitted with monkey glands, what more can you expect?\nCreate a climate within you, create a spring within you. Become meditative, more and more meditative. And the first requirement of becoming meditative is not to desire at all, not even for God. Not to desire at all – that is the most fundamental principle of meditation.\nDesire always leads you into tense states of mind. Desire is tension; non-desire is relaxation.\nForget all about the Buddha, and giving birth to a Buddha. Why should you get in such a trouble? You become the Buddha; you owe it to yourself. Your only responsibility is towards yourself. If some Buddha wants to be born, he will find a way; that is his problem. He will find a way and a womb. Why should you be worried?\nBut don’t waste your time in unnecessary desires. And watch. The mind is so cunning, it can give you such beautiful desires, such spiritual desires, that you almost forget that they are also desires, and desires are desires. All desires are the same.\nNow there are many women here – that’s why I have answered this question – who are hoping that someday I will permit my sannyasins to give birth to Buddhas. They go on writing letters to me that “Osho, should I get sterilized or not? If someday you feel that I am ready to give birth to a Buddha, then what, if I am sterilized? Should I wait?”\nDon’t bother. Buddhas will find their ways, and there are so many women in the world. If you feel that it is going to help you on your own spiritual path, in your own growth, then be sterilized. Nothing to be worried about. If you feel this will keep you away from unnecessary troubles and unnecessary responsibilities, it is perfectly good. Your only responsibility is towards yourself.\nYou become a Buddha! I am here to help you to become Buddhas. Don’t bother about becoming fathers and mothers of Buddhas. There are many other foolish people who can do this.\nThe last question:\nQuestion 7\nWHY DO THE SUFIS DANCE?\nYes, it is a pertinent question. Buddhists only sit silently. Why do Sufis dance? Zen people only meditate, sitting silently, not doing a thing, doing nothing – just sitting silently? spring comes, and the grass grows by itself. But Sufis dance.\nThese are the two different paths, because there are two types of energy in the world: the positive and the negative, male and female, yin and yang. Zen people use the negative energy; they use the passive path. Sufis use the positive energy; they use the active path. They are very vibrant people. Their meditation is not of passivity; their meditation is that of ecstasy.\nBoth are ways you can reach to the same goal, because the goal is exactly in the middle. The positive is one extreme, the negative the other extreme. Between the positive and the negative there is a middle point, exactly in the middle, from where transformation happens – one transcends the world and everything – from where one enters into God and becomes God.\nIf you feel that you are on the negative pole already, a passive type, then follow Zen and start moving deeply in your passivity, and one day you will reach the middle. Or if you feel that you are an active person, full of energy, youth, positivity, that sitting silently is very difficult, unnecessarily a torture, then dance, follow the Sufis’ way.\nAnd I go on speaking on Zen and Sufism again and again so that all kinds of people are helped here. You have to choose. You have to watch yourself, your energy, and then you choose. Both are valid ways, both lead to the same goal.\nRumi says, “Hey I Drink this fine fiery wine, these needles of fire, and fall so drunk that you will not wake on the Day of Resurrection.”\nThe way of the Sufi is the way of the drunkard, the dancer, who becomes almost intoxicated in his dancing, who is transported through his dance. He is inebriated; his dance is psychedelic.\nIt is said that Mohammed once said to Ali, “You are of me, and I am of you.” When he heard this, Ali became ecstatic and involuntarily started dancing. What else can you do, when a man like Mohammed says to you, “You are of me, and I am of you”? How to receive this? Ali did well.\nAnd remember, it is not anything that he did. It was involuntary. He started dancing; out of ecstasy the dance started flowing.\nAnother time, Mohammed said to Jafar, “You are like me in both looks and character.” Here again, in wajd, Jafar started dancing. What else to do? When Mohammed must have looked into the eyes of Jafar, wajd, samadhi, was created, the transfer beyond the scriptures happened. How to receive this? How not to dance? It would have been impossible not to dance. Jafar danced.\nIt is said, “The enrapturing of the Sufi by God, or rather the ‘pull’ of God, keeps the Sufi continually in spiritual, inner dance and movement.” It is not that the Sufi dances – God keeps dancing in him.\nWhat can he do?\n“Whenever a wave of such divine rapture strikes the heart of the Sufi, it creates great waves in\nthe lake of his inner being.” He is just a receptacle. To say that the Sufi is dancing is not right. The\nSufi is being danced. He cannot help it, he is helpless. Something is pouring into him and it is too much; it starts overflowing in his dancing and singing.\n“This, in turn, causes his body to move. Upon seeing such movement non-Sufis have often supposed that the Sufi is dancing. In reality, however, it is the waves of the ocean of God that are tossing and turning the anchorless vessel that is the heart of the Sufi.”\nOn the surface, from the outside, the Sufi seems to be dancing. But he is not dancing, because there is no dancer. It is pure dance. God has taken possession of him. The Sufi is drunk, intoxicated. His state is that of non-being. He is anchorless. The waves of the ocean toss and turn. First his inner being is stirred, great joy arises there; and then it starts spreading towards his body.\nThat’s what you are doing with Aneeta; that’s what is happening to Aneeta. You are participating in something immensely beautiful in Sufi dancing. Remember it: forget the dancer and be the dance.\nThe way of the Sufi is the way of dance, song, celebration.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"9912","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_secret/part14/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_secret/>The Secret</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">14 Forget The Dancer And Be The Dance</h1><div class=post-meta>47 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;9912 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Secret/part14.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part13>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

nothing to see, only emptiness in the hands, no experience at all, then
suddenly you realize yourself. Then you turn upon yourself, then you
fall into your source. And that is not an experience, it is a
realization. That is the difference between the words “experience” and
“realization”. It is not that you have seen something, experienced
something. Now you know who you are.</p><p><br></p><p>The great Sufi mystic Maghrebi says,</p><p>Don’t speak to us of visions and miracles, for we have long ago
transcended such things. We saw them all to be illusion and dreams, and
dauntlessly we passed beyond them.</p><p>Anand Buddha, you will meet many people here who will go on playing
these games. They are simply wasting their time. Avoid their company. I
am going to attract all kinds of people, and particularly the people who
are interested in spiritualism. They will bring all their diseases here.
They will talk nonsense – they will talk about miracles, psychic
experiences. And naturally, when somebody talks about such things, you
start feeling as if you are missing. You are not missing a thing,
because he is only dreaming.</p><p><br></p><p>But he can create this feeling in you, that you are lacking
something, that your growth is not going well, that you are not growing
as fast as you should grow. He will create in you the feeling of
inferiority, and that is dangerous. Once you start feeling inferior you
become sad, depressed, you carry a heavy weight on your chest; and that
will become a hindrance in your growth.</p><p><br></p><p>And every possibility is there that if you desire you will start
seeing these things. Desire creates dreams. If you start thinking that
you are missing, soon your mind will project. The mind is always ready
to give you anything that you desire, and particularly such things. If
you desire money it will be difficult because it is not only a question
of your own mind. If you desire to become the president of a country it
may not be easy because there may be much competition. But if you want
to see auras there is no competition, and nobody can hinder you, and you
are not taking somebody else’s auras; you are creating your own. It is a
private, idiotic world. This is the meaning of the word “idiot”: it
means having a private world of one’s own experiences which do not
collaborate with reality.</p><p><br></p><p>I know a few people are here; they enjoy a kind of leadership because
they can gather a few people around themselves. They start talking about
esoteric things. And whenever somebody talks about esoteric things,
hidden truths that you are not aware of, he enjoys being a knower and he
reduces you to an ignorant person. It hurts. Soon you will also start
talking and reading such nonsense books, and they are available in
abundance.</p><p><br></p><p>Here, you are not to be with me to see auras, or to see lights, or to
see kundalini energy rising, or the chakras opening. I am trying to
hammer this truth into your heart continuously, that the only thing
worth attaining is enlightenment, is nirvana, is the realization of who
you are. Everything else has to be bypassed. And these things come on
the way.</p><p><br></p><p>The mind tries to allure you to the very end. It gives beautiful
psychedelic experiences, very colorful, enchanting. One can get stuck
with them. LSD is nothing. If you go on working on your being you will
find far deeper, far profounder-appearing experiences happening to you
which no LSD can release.</p><p><br></p><p>And then the desire is to cling to them, and that very desire keeps
you away from the ultimate truth. For the ultimate truth, everything has
to be sacrificed, all so-called spiritual experiences, esoteric
knowledge, miracles. Everything has to be dropped. One has to come to
the ultimate experience – which is not an experience.…</p><p><br></p><p>Language is inadequate to express it; that’s why it is called an
“experience”. It is not an experience, because in experience there is a
division of the experiencer and the experienced, and in this</p><p>experience, the ultimate, there is no division. You are the knower,
you are the known, you are the seer, you are the seen, you are the
experiencer, you are the experienced – only you are.</p><p><br></p><p>That absolute, still point of pure existence, that is the goal. All
else has to be sacrificed for it. Beware of such things.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard...</p><p><br></p><p>A man was telling his friend about his recent trip to Europe and
said, “You know, I went to Europe with my friend Seymour – you know
Seymour, the cripple, the one with the crutches under each arm? Well,
first we went to London where we visited the Tower of London. I climbed
to the very top of it but poor Seymour, the cripple, the one with the
crutches under each arm, he could not make it.</p><p><br></p><p>“Then we went to Paris, France, where again I climbed to the top of
the Eiffel Tower – but poor Seymour, the cripple, the one with the
crutches under each arm, could not make it.</p><p><br></p><p>“But then we went to Rome and ended up with a private audience with
the Pope. The Pope walked into the room, took one look at Seymour, the
cripple, the one with the crutches under each arm, and walked over to
him and placed a kiss on the right cheek of Seymour. As if by magic,
Seymour threw his right crutch away.</p><p><br></p><p>“Then the Pope came over to Seymour’s left cheek and gave him a kiss
– and again as if by magic, he threw his left crutch down.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What happened next?” his friend asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, Seymour is a cripple, you know – he fell down right on his
ass.” The second question:</p><p>Question 2</p><p><br></p><p>ISN’T WHAT YOU SAY BEYOND THE BOUNDARIES OF HUMAN CAPACITIES?</p><p><br></p><p>There are no boundaries to human capacities. All boundaries are our
beliefs; there are no boundaries. Man is part of infinity, and the part
is equal to the whole – that is the law of higher mathematics. In the
world of lower mathematics, the part is never equal to the whole, the
part is smaller than the whole, obviously. In the world of higher
mathematics, the part is equal to the whole, never smaller than the
whole – because the part is the whole. Just as the whole contains the
part, the part contains the whole. They are not separate at all, nowhere
separate. No boundary divides the part from the whole. It is one reality
seen in two ways.</p><p><br></p><p>When you see the dewdrop, it is one way of seeing the ocean, that’s
all, because the dewdrop contains all that the whole ocean contains. If
one dewdrop is understood, if you have analyzed one dewdrop, you have
known all the secrets of all the oceans, not only of this earth, but
wherever the ocean exists, on other planets, on other earths. And
scientists say there are at least fifty thousand planets where water
exists, life exists. Wherever water exists, that one dewdrop has
revealed to you</p><p>the whole secret of all possible oceans. Analyzing one dewdrop, you
will come to the truth of H2O, and that contains all.</p><p><br></p><p>Man is a dewdrop, man contains the whole. There are no
boundaries.</p><p><br></p><p>But if you believe in boundaries then they are; your belief creates
them. You are as big as you believe yourself to be – “As a man thinketh,
so he is.” And if you don’t believe in anything, you are infinite,
because no belief can be infinite. All beliefs are bound to be finite.
The belief needs a definition; hence it will be finite – howsoever big,
but it will still be finite.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why I tell you again and again, drop all beliefs. In dropping
beliefs you will be dropping all definitions, all boundaries, all
limitations. When a person has dropped all beliefs, all thoughts, all
desires, there is nothing to create the boundary. He is the whole.</p><p><br></p><p>That is the moment when Mansur shouted out of joy, “Ana el haq!” – I
am the truth The third question:</p><p>Question 3</p><p><br></p><p>OSHO, IN A RECENT ARTICLE IN THE INTERNATIONAL HERALD TRIBUNE,
WILLIAM BORDERS, A LONGTIME OBSERVER OF THIS COUNTRY FOR THE NEW YORK
TIMES’ OFFICE IN NEW DELHI, WROTE OF HOW WE ARE AN EMBARRASSMENT TO
“IMAGE- SHY INDIA”. WHAT IS IT ABOUT INDIA THAT MAKES INDIANS SO
CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR INTERNATIONAL IMAGE? AND WHY CANNOT INDIA BE PROUD
OF YOU? NEVER HAS THERE BEEN A RELIGIOUS LEADER IN HISTORY THAT HAS
RECEIVED SO MUCH PUBLICITY ABROAD.</p><p><br></p><p>Krishna Prem, India is a very poor country. It has nothing else to
claim except its so-called spirituality. That’s its only ego. And each
country needs a certain ego; otherwise the country need not exist. Each
nation exists as an ego, and the ego needs some supports.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why I am against all kinds of nationalism, because its root is
ego. It divides people, it makes people fight each other. It creates
antagonism, enmity. I am against all nationalism, against all
nations.</p><p><br></p><p>I would like to see one world where all these egos, the Indian and
the Japanese and the German and the English and the French, have
disappeared, because these are illnesses. The ego is like cancer, but
even cancer needs something to feed upon; it cannot live on nothing. The
ego needs something to nourish it.</p><p><br></p><p>The West can claim science, scientific knowledge, technology, great,
beautiful Cities, good roads, aeroplanes, man’s reaching to the moon,
and a thousand and one things. The West has many things to support its
ego, India has nothing. It can only claim spirituality. And that’s its
fear: that spirituality is also bogus.</p><p><br></p><p>It is very much afraid. If that spirituality is exposed as bogus,
then it has nowhere to stand, no shelter; then it will fall flat on the
ground. It respects, feels proud of, the people who go on claiming</p><p>its spirituality and its spiritual greatness. It is proud of
Vivekananda because he helps its ego to be strengthened. It is proud of
Radhakrishnan. It is proud of Mahatma Gandhi. They all give support to
its illusory idea of being spiritual.</p><p><br></p><p>How can it be proud of me? I am taking the last prop away from it. I
am telling the world that this whole spirituality that India claims is
bogus.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, there have been a few spiritual people in India, as there have
been everywhere. There is nothing to claim, nothing special to claim
about it. Yes, Buddha has been here and Mahavira has been here and
Krishna has been here. But so what? Lao Tzu and Chuang Tzu and Lieh Tzu
have been in China; and Zarathustra and Moses and Ezekiel and John the
Baptist and Jesus and Mohammed and Saint Francis<span class=s4></span>You can go on counting hundreds of names from all over
the world.</p><p>It is nothing special to India.</p><p><br></p><p>This land is in no way more spiritual than any other land, but then
it hurts. Then there is nothing left to claim, and the Indian ego feels
hurt.</p><p><br></p><p>They are angry with me because I am telling them, “Whatsoever you are
claiming is just holy cow dung. You are not spiritual. In fact, you are
only hypocrites – the greatest hypocrites in the world.”</p><p><br></p><p>I have walked all over the country, from one corner to the other
corner. I have watched the whole country very minutely. It is utterly
materialistic, but it hides its materialism in a spiritual garb; and
because of this spiritual claim, it cannot fulfill its materialist
needs. And deep down it hankers for materialism, and on the surface it
goes on pretending. India has that haughty look of holier-than- thou. It
goes on believing that it has the claim to being the spiritual master of
the whole world. It is all nonsense.</p><p><br></p><p>Spiritual people have been everywhere, spiritual people will go on
happening everywhere. No society is spiritual yet; only individuals are.
No nation is spiritual yet.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why, Krishna Prem, it cannot be proud of me.</p><p><br></p><p>Only one Western woman, Nivedita, had come with Vivekananda, and
India was very proud. Now, thousands of women and men have come to me,
but India cannot be proud of it. Why? I am not in any way supporting its
chauvinistic claims.</p><p><br></p><p>I am for one world. I am not an Indian and I am not a German and I am
not a Chinese. I claim the whole world as mine, and I would like nations
to disappear.</p><p><br></p><p>And if India really feels it has some claim to being spiritual, then
let India disappear first. That will be proof. Let India disappear as a
nation; let it become an international land. That will be proof,
concrete proof. But people go on talking about non-violence in India,
and go on preparing for war. They go on talking about brotherhood and
the unity of all religions, and just go on doing the opposite of it.</p><p><br></p><p>Because I am exposing things as they are, because I am functioning
like an x-ray, they are angry. Nobody likes the x-ray, because it
reveals your bones, your skeleton, your skull; and you have been</p><p>thinking yourself so beautiful and all that comes out is just a
skeleton? So this is you? You become angry, you become annoyed. Their
annoyance with me is understandable. I perfectly understand it.</p><p><br></p><p>India has lived for a thousand years under slavery. It has become
very, very afraid of becoming a slave again. It knows that it has the
capacity to become a slave at any moment. One thousand years of slavery
is enough to prove to the country that somehow we are missing in some
qualities. A great inferiority complex has arisen out of these one
thousand years. And whenever a country or a man or a race suffers from
an inferiority complex, it starts pretending to be superior. The
superiority complex is a way to avoid one’s inferiority complex; that is
a camouflage.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what India is doing now. It wants to pretend, claim, prove to
the world that we are spiritually very superior. It is afraid. It has
nothing to claim. It is afraid, very much fearful inside, and out of
that fear it has to create a very bold face on the outside. Deep down
there is a trembling that every day the country is going more and more
into darkness, more and more into poverty and starvation. The future is
bleak; there seems to be no future.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, how to avoid seeing this danger that is coming closer every
moment? The only way is to look at the past: don’t look at the future,
turn your back towards the future; look at the past. Talk of the golden
days – ramrajya – when there were rivers of milk and butter and honey in
the country – rivers – and the whole country was a golden bird. Delight
in that fantasy! – which has no relevance to history, which has no truth
in it. Yes, a few people have always been rich, but the major part of
the country has always been poor.</p><p><br></p><p>But you can create your own past; nobody can prevent you. You can
glory in your past; you can magnify it as big as you want. India
delights in magnifying its past, in making it bigger and bigger, more
and more golden – just to avoid the future that is coming every moment.
And any moment it will grip the whole country.</p><p><br></p><p>It happens almost always: when a person is dying, he starts thinking
of the old beautiful days of childhood just to avoid the death that is
approaching. It is said that if somebody is drowning, he starts seeing
his whole life revealed like a film. What really happens? He is dying;
he is in pain, great anguish. He needs some consolation, he wants to
forget about it all. Where to go? Except for the past, there is no other
way. So India continuously goes into the past. When a nation is young it
thinks of the future. When a nation is old and rotten it thinks of the
past.</p><p><br></p><p>And I go on continuously saying that the past that the Indians think
they had, they never had. They only believe in it, it is their fantasy;
they paint it. They go on saying that in the old ancient days the people
were so good that there was no need to lock your houses. There was no
stealing, no thieves, no robbers. This is all nonsense.</p><p><br></p><p>Then to whom was Buddha saying “Don’t steal”? Then to whom was he
teaching? To us? Twenty- five centuries before, he was talking to us?
For forty-two years continuously, day in, day out, he was moving in the
country and telling people, “Don’t steal. That is a great sin; you will
suffer in hell. Don’t lie, otherwise you will suffer in hell. Don’t be
violent. Don’t be jealous. Don’t murder. Don’t hurt. Don’t commit
suicide.” To whom was he talking?</p><p><br></p><p>And it is not only that Buddha was saying that. You can go as far
back as possible; even in the Vedas the same teaching is available.</p><p>When some teaching is there it means it had some relevance. Just as
people are now, they were then. Buddha was not a madman, Mahavira was
not a madman. If people were already non-violent, peaceful, loving, to
whom were they talking about non-violence, who were they teaching? And
it was not just once in a while. Their whole life they were doing only
one thing: teaching people non-violence. People must have been utterly
violent.</p><p><br></p><p>The moral teaching has not changed; it is the same as it was before.
That simply means people are the same as they were before. People were
as possessive, as desirous of things, as they are now. Certainly, they
desired different things because those things were available to them.
They could not have desired an aeroplane, that is true, but they all
desired beautiful golden chariots, they desired beautiful palaces. It is
the same. The object of the desire does not make any difference.</p><p><br></p><p>As far as I see, the ordinary man has always been the same. And as
far as those few people who became enlightened are concerned, they have
also always been the same. Buddha happening twenty-five centuries before
or today; it is the same. And the unenlightened person of five thousand
years before and of today is the same; there is no difference at all.
There are only two kinds of people: the enlightened and the
unenlightened. The unenlightened has persisted in his own way. The
enlightened persons have always been the same wherever they have
existed; their taste is the same.</p><p><br></p><p>But India is afraid of the future – which is coming with great speed.
The population is growing every day. Each day brings more and more
misery and more and more starvation, more and more people to be fed,
clothed, sheltered. And people who are already here are starving. The
future seems to be absolutely dark.</p><p><br></p><p>Now what to do in such a situation? The easiest, although foolish,
way – but the easiest – is to glorify the past, to keep yourself
intoxicated with the past. Hence they are angry at me because I destroy
their fantasies. I say if the future is coming and it is bleak, then it
is better to see it. The sooner you do, the better, because something
can still be done. And I don’t think that nothing is possible, but this
ostrich-type mind which avoids seeing it will not be able to do a
thing.</p><p><br></p><p>I want that our eyes should be focused on the future. Forget the
past; it is gone and gone forever and there is no point wasting time
with it. Stop reading your scriptures parrot-like. Don’t go on
continuously repeating the old, because it is not going to help in the
future. For the future, you will need a new mind because the crisis that
is coming on is so new, you will need a totally different approach.</p><p><br></p><p>Nobody wants to see it, and I would force people to see it, because
the sooner it is looked into, the better. Something can still be done. I
don’t think that it is impossible; I am not a pessimist. The situation
is bad, but I am an optimist. I have hope that something can be
done.</p><p><br></p><p>And maybe these are the moments when countries change, when people
change: when a crisis comes over, the very challenge can become a
breakthrough. This opportunity has to be used.</p><p><br></p><p>But to face the future and not to be destroyed by it needs courage,
needs intelligence, needs new orientations of the mind. That’s what I am
trying to do. The Indian mind has to reorient itself.</p><p>For example, it should stop talking about distributing the wealth.
There is no wealth to distribute. It should start creating wealth. How
to create wealth? Open the doors of the country to all countries, to
international sources of wealth, so they can start pouring in. For
thirty years this country has been doing just the opposite: preventing
foreign capital from coming into the country – afraid. Invite foreign
capital, make every guarantee that their capital will be safe. And the
whole world is interested because much capital is lying around the world
uselessly. That capital needs to be used. But in the West, in fact, now
there is no scope for spreading.</p><p><br></p><p>India can become a really flowering country if the wealth pours in
from all the sources. But it is very afraid. It is afraid of America; if
American wealth comes in, it is afraid that we may be overpowered by it.
There is no need to be afraid. America is not interested in overpowering
any country politically. America’s whole interest is how to create more
wealth for itself. You can create wealth for yourself and for America
too; both will be benefited.</p><p><br></p><p>But this country has been following a foreign policy of remaining
neutral, which is wrong. You need friends. If you remain neutral you
will not have any friends. This country needs all the friends possible.
Neutrality creates suspicion in people. That means you are with nobody
and nobody wants to be with you. This country has become isolated; these
thirty years the country has remained like an isolated part of the
world, closed.</p><p><br></p><p>Open your doors. Let the wind and the sun and the rain come in. Open
your doors. Invite Western technology to help you to develop. Let the
wealth pour in from every nook and corner, and make it certain that
their wealth will be secure.</p><p><br></p><p>But it is very much afraid: and the fear is that if you take help
from others that again exposes your inferiority, so you have to do
everything on your own. And this country has never been technological,
so it has no technological mind. But you have to do it on your own. Even
if you mess up everything you have to do it on your own, so you can keep
a face in the world that “We are doing it on our own,” that “We don’t
need anybody’s help.” This is an egoistic attitude.</p><p><br></p><p>This whole world now has to be interdependent. All ideas of
independence and dependence are out of date. Forget about them. The
world is now one organic unity; it is already one organic unity. Your
nations are just fading realities, overshadowing the present and the
future unnecessarily, just dead bodies, stinking. They have to be burned
and thrown away.</p><p><br></p><p>This world now is one, and the question of dependence, independence
does not arise. It is an interdependent world. Let this word become very
significant; it is going to become significant in the future. The world
is interdependent. There are a few things we can fulfill for others,
there are a few things others can fulfill for us, and there is no
question of ego involved.</p><p><br></p><p>We know the technology of the inner. If the West wants to understand
about meditation, we can help. We can make them astronauts of the inner.
But Indians trying to reach the moon on their own; it will never be
possible, it is impossible.</p><p><br></p><p>The only way for the Indians to reach the moon will be to stand on
each other’s shoulders and try!</p><p><br></p><p>Just as the West is ignorant of the inner world, the East is ignorant
of the outer world. We can combine. A great friendship is needed. You
can watch; it has happened already.</p><p>Japan is more affluent than it ever was. Just because of the Second
World War, it came in contact with American technology. Now it is one of
the richest countries of the world. In the East it is the richest. It
has happened very illogically, because a country is destroyed in a war,
and Japan was the first country in human history that was utterly
devastated and destroyed. The atom bomb was tried on it. But out of that
destruction Japan was born, a new Japan was born. America has helped it
technologically.</p><p><br></p><p>And that has been the case in Germany too. The part that has come
under American influence has become very rich, one of the richest
countries in the world, and the part that has gone to the communist bloc
remains as poor as ever.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard, a Jew suggested in the Jewish parliament, “The only way
for us to become rich is to declare war against America.” Now, Israel
declaring war against America – the whole parliament laughed. “Have you
gone mad?” they said. “How can we win?” The man said, “There is no need
to win. If we are defeated, then American technology will be available
just as it has been available to Japan and Germany. If we are defeated,
we will become the richest country in the world. And by chance, by luck,
if we are not defeated and we become the winners, then certainly we will
be the richest country in the world. So we have nothing to lose either
way. If we win, we win; if we are defeated, then too we are
victorious.”</p><p><br></p><p>India needs Western technology, and India needs to be aware that you
cannot become rich on your own. You don’t know how. For five thousand
years you have become accustomed to poverty. You have taken it for
granted; it has become your way of life. You have even started praising
it. You think to be poor is somehow spiritual, to be ill is somehow
spiritual.</p><p><br></p><p>It happens, when a country has remained poor for thousands of years,
it starts claiming something special in its poverty. It happens to you
individually too. If a man is poor and cannot get rich, he starts
bragging, “I don’t want to become rich ‘the grapes are sour’ – who
bothers to become rich? I am happy in my poverty; poverty has something
special in it. In fact, you are missing something; I am not missing.”
These are the rationalizations.</p><p><br></p><p>I would like to see India holding hands with the West in deep
friendship, helping them towards the inner search, which is becoming
more and more passionate every day in the West, which always becomes so
whenever a country becomes affluent.</p><p><br></p><p>Now the West wants to know “Who am I?” We have all the technology for
it. For five thousand years we have done only that and nothing else. We
can release a new energy, a new impetus and momentum, to spiritual
growth; just as the West can release a great energy to the East for
materialistic growth.</p><p><br></p><p>But for that you will have to drop your stupid anti-materialistic
attitudes. You will have to come down to the earth. You will have to
become earthy, sensuous, intelligent.</p><p><br></p><p>I teach a sensuous religion. That’s why Indians are against me. I
teach an earthy religion, rooted in the earth. Yes, raise your branches
into the sky, let your flowers bloom into the clouds, but get your roots
deep into the earth; otherwise there will be no flowering. A real
religion cannot be only af the sky, and it cannot be only of the earth.
A real religion is always a meeting of the earth and the sky.</p><p>I am a meeting of the earth and the sky, and that is the problem.
They cannot be proud of me; they think I am a Charvaka, a materialist
like Epicurus, that my philosophy is of “Eat, drink, and be merry.” Yes,
that too is part of my philosophy, but just a part. I am not against
eating, drinking, and merrying. Eat, drink, and be merry – but that’s
not all. When you have eaten enough, and drunk enough, and you have
“merried” enough, then something higher is waiting. And only then is
something higher possible. When the earthly part in you is satisfied,
contented, then the sky claims you, then the unknown. claims you, then
begins the real pilgrimage of the soul.</p><p><br></p><p>I am earthy. I teach a sensuous religion, a religion which is not
against the body, which is not against matter, which is not against the
world. My religion is big enough – it contains all. It is inclusive, it
includes all. It does not exclude anything. It is as inclusive as God
himself.</p><p><br></p><p>God includes all, certainly. The earth must be in God, otherwise how
can the earth exist? And God must be in the earth, otherwise how can the
earth remain alive?</p><p><br></p><p>I am teaching a new religion because, in the old days, India became
hung up too much in the sky, with the clouds; it forgot how to grow
roots in the earth. It becomes angry, it is annoyed, it cannot be proud
of me. I appear to be an enemy who is going to destroy its great
tradition, as if I am against its spirituality. I am not, but the
spirituality is possible only if it is based, founded, in a scientific
materialism.</p><p><br></p><p>And you ask, Krishna Prem, why it is so “image-shy”, It is so
image-shy because it knows its hypocrisies. Only a hypocrite is
image-shy. The true person never is. The true person can stand naked
under the sun, he is available, he has nothing to fear. He is as he is;
he has never pretended otherwise. But a person who pretends is always
afraid because his image is false. He is afraid: if somebody looks
deeper, comes closer, then the image will be gone, then the reality will
be found; and the reality is just the contrary.</p><p><br></p><p>Only the hypocrite is afraid of being found out. India is very much
afraid – afraid that its image can be shattered very easily. It is a
very poor, impotent image that can be shattered so easily. It seems it
has no soul, no vitality in it. When you are true you are ready and
available. You need not be worried. You are rooted in your being; you
trust yourself. India does not trust itself; that’s why it is
afraid.</p><p><br></p><p>Just think – I am only one of my type. India has thousands of
“mahatmas”. They are afraid I will destroy their in age, and what are
your thousands and thousands of mahatmas doing? They are creating your
image. Thousands of mahatmas are creating, and only one madman is
destroying it; why are you afraid? How can I destroy it?</p><p><br></p><p>But they know that even those thousands creating the image can be
defeated by a single person because their image is just a dream. It is
not true, it is not real. They are too apprehensive. If the world comes
to know the reality of the Indian mind, then what will happen to their
bragging, that they have been doing down the ages, that “We are the most
spiritual people of the world”?</p><p><br></p><p>Why should you be afraid? Why should one single man like me be
feared? But the reason is clear: when truth is there it can destroy the
lies. Even if the lies are repeated by millions of people, a single
truth is enough to shatter those lies. Otherwise give me freedom as you
have given freedom to your</p><p>other mahatmas. Let me do my experiment, you go on doing your
experiment, and whosoever is true is going to win. Why be so afraid? If
I am untrue, my untruth will undo me. If you are true, you will win.</p><p><br></p><p>The Indian government has its motto: Satyamew Jayate – Truth Is
Always Victorious. Then why be afraid? Truth will be victorious.</p><p><br></p><p>Just the other day, Neervana received a letter from the Indian
embassy in America. He had applied for a visa. The letter has refused
the visa, and the reason given is that “If you had asked for the visa to
visit and stay in some institution other than the Rajneesh Ashram, you
would have got it, but we cannot give it to you for this. You have asked
to stay in a wrong kind of institution.”</p><p><br></p><p>Satyamew Jayate – Truth Is Always Victorious.</p><p><br></p><p>Why are you so afraid? Let people come and see. It is better that
they come and see the untruth of my being, and then they will not come
to me at all.</p><p><br></p><p>And you have thousands of other institutions which are supported by
the government, which are supported by the masses. I am not supported by
anybody. Neither do the masses support me nor does the government. I am
not supported by anybody; I exist on my own. My people exist on their
own. We don’t live on anybody’s charity.</p><p><br></p><p>Why be afraid of us? But the reason is there: even a small ray of
truth is enough to destroy the whole ocean of darkness.</p><p><br></p><p>The fourth question:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 4</p><p><br></p><p>OSHO, WHY ARE YOU SO HARD ON POLITICIANS?</p><p><br></p><p>I will tell you a story. That will be my answer.</p><p><br></p><p>A man bought a very well-bred and expensive young donkey, but upon
his return home with it, found it resisted all his efforts to saddle it,
let alone carry his goods. Finally, in frustration, he took it to a
donkey-trainer of some renown.</p><p><br></p><p>“This hayburner cost me a packet and won’t do a damn thing. You
reckon you can help?”</p><p><br></p><p>Without answering, the trainer seized a length of 3 x 2 and smote the
beast squarely between the eyes, knocking it back on its haunches.</p><p><br></p><p>“A thousand bloody dollars and you attack it with a Piece of wood?”
shrieked the distraught owner.</p><p><br></p><p>“Listen,” replied the other calmly, “when you are dealing with a
donkey, the first thing you gotta do is get his attention.”</p><p><br></p><p>The fifth question:</p><p>Question 5</p><p><br></p><p>I FREQUENTLY HEAR YOU SPEAK ABOUT REBELLION. THE PRIESTS AND NUNS AND
RELATIVES THAT SHAPED MY TRAINING ARE NOW OLD AND DRIED UP. MOST ARE
DEAD. IT SEEMS WORTHLESS TO REBEL AGAINST THOSE HELPLESS OLD PEOPLE.</p><p><br></p><p>I AM NOW THE PRIEST AND THE DOCTRINES. I FEEL THAT TO REBEL AGAINST
ANYTHING OUTSIDE MYSELF IS A WASTE OF TIME AND JUST SIMPLY NOT TO THE
POINT. THIS MAKES THE SITUATION MUCH MORE FRUSTRATING AND ENTANGLED. IT
SEEMS THE SELF MUST REBEL AGAINST THE SELF. I ACCEPT THAT IT IS NOT THE
ESSENTIAL SELF – THE ORIGINAL FACE – THAT HAS TO DO THE REBELLING. IT IS
THE TRAINED SELF – THE SUBTERFUGE. BUT THAT IS THE ONLY “SELF” I HAVE OR
KNOW WITH WHICH TO DO THE REBELLING. HOW DOES THE SUBTERFUGE REBEL
AGAINST THE SUBTERFUGE?</p><p><br></p><p>Premananda, the rebellion I am talking about is not to be done
against anybody. It is not really a rebellion, but only an
understanding. You are not to fight with the outer priests, nuns,
parents, no. And you are not to fight, either, with the inner priests,
nuns, parents. Because outer or inner, it doesn’t matter, they are
separate from you. The outer is separate, the inner too is separate. The
inner is only the reflection of the outer.</p><p><br></p><p>You are perfectly right in saying, “It seems worthless to rebel
against those helpless old people.” I am not telling you to rebel
against those old, helpless people. And I am not telling you, either, to
rebel against all that they have put inside you. If you rebel against
your own mind it will be a reaction, not a rebellion. Note the
difference. A reaction is out of anger; a reaction is violent. In a
reaction you become blind with rage. In a reaction you start moving to
the other extreme.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, if your parents have been teaching you to be clean and
take a bath every day, and this and that, and you have been taught from
the very beginning that cleanliness is next to God, and one day you
start rebelling, what will you do? You will stop taking a bath. You will
start living in filth.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what hippies go on doing all over the world. They think this
is rebellion. Now they have moved to the other extreme. They were taught
cleanliness is next to God; now they are thinking that filthiness is
next to God, dirtiness is next to God. From one extreme they have moved
to the other. This is not rebellion. This is rage, this is anger, this
is revenge.</p><p><br></p><p>And while reacting to your parents and their so-called ideas of
cleanliness, you are still attached to the same idea. It is still
haunting you, it is still powerful over you, it is still dominant, it is
still decisive. It still decides your life, although you have become the
opposite of it; but it decides. You cannot take a bath easily; you are
reminded of your parents who used to force you to take a bath every day.
Now you don’t take a bath at all.</p><p><br></p><p>Who is dominating you? Your parents, still. Still, what they have
done to you, you have not been able to undo. This is reaction, this is
not rebellion.</p><p><br></p><p>Then what is rebellion? Rebellion is pure understanding. You simply
understand what is the case. Then you are no more neurotically obsessed
with cleanliness, that’s all. You don’t become unclean. Cleanliness has
its own beauty. One should not be obsessed by it, because obsession is
ill.</p><p>For example, a person continuously washing his hands the whole day –
then he is neurotic. Washing of the hands is not bad, but just washing
your hands the whole day is mad. But from washing your hands the whole
day, if you move to non-washing, you stop washing forever, then again
you are trapped in another kind of madness, the opposite kind.</p><p><br></p><p>The man of understanding washes his hands when it is needed. When it
is not needed, he is not obsessed with it. He is simply natural,
spontaneous about it. He lives intelligently, that’s all.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, there is not much difference in obsession and
intelligence if you don’t watch very minutely. If you come across a
snake on the road and you jump, naturally you jump out of fear. But this
fear is intelligence. If you are unintelligent, stupid, then you will
not jump out of the way and you will unnecessarily invite danger into
your life. The intelligent person will jump immediately – the snake is
there. It is out of fear, but this fear is intelligent, positive,
life-serving.</p><p><br></p><p>But this fear can become obsessive. For example, you cannot sit in a
house. Who knows? It may fall. And houses have been known to fall, that
is true. Sometimes they have fallen; you are not absolutely wrong. You
can argue that, “If other houses have fallen, why not this?” Now you are
afraid to live under any roof – it may fall. This is obsession. Now it
is becoming unintelligent.</p><p><br></p><p>It is good to be aware that you eat clean food. But I know a man, a
great poet.<span class=s4></span>Once he traveled</p><p>with me. His wife told me, “Now you will know how difficult it is to
live with this man.” I said, “What is the matter?” She said, “You will
know yourself.” He would not drink any tea, any water, anywhere. It was
so difficult, because he would say, “Who knows, if there are germs in
the tea or the water?” He would not eat in any hotel. It was such a
problem. And we had to travel for thirty-six hours in the train, and he
was starving and thirsty and he would not drink water.</p><p><br></p><p>I tried in every way to persuade him. He said, “No. Who knows, if
there are germs, then? It is better,” he said, “to starve for thirty-six
hours and not to eat. I am not going to die; don’t be worried.” But I
could see the man was torturing himself. It was hot summer and he was
thirsty. And I tried in every station – I brought soda, I brought
Coca-Cola, and everything. He said, “Forget all about it – I cannot take
anything unless I am absolutely certain. What is the certainty? What is
the guarantee?”</p><p><br></p><p>And he is not absolutely wrong, that is true. You know India, and you
know Indian stations and Indian hotels. You know. He is right, but now
this is carrying the logic too far.</p><p><br></p><p>Then I told him, “Stop breathing too!” He said, “Why?” I said, “Who
knows, what is the guarantee? Stop breathing! Either drink this water or
stop breathing!” Then he was brought to his senses, because I was really
angry. “Why do you go on breathing? Who knows, there may be germs, there
are germs everywhere.”</p><p><br></p><p>He drank a cup of tea, but the way he drank! His face... I cannot
forget. It has been ten years by now, but I cannot forget his face – as
if I was killing him! I was murderous! And he was obliging me!</p><p><br></p><p>And at the next station, he got down and he said, “I cannot travel
with you; I will go back home.” I said, “What is the matter?” He said,
“You were so angry, and it seemed that you would start beating me or
something. And you said,‘Don’t breathe anymore.’ How can I stop
breathing?” I said, “I was just giving you an argument, that if you can
breathe, then why not drink the water? It is the same Indian water as
the Indian air. Don’t be worried.”</p><p>He refused to travel with me. I had to travel alone. He went back,
and since then I have not seen him.</p><p><br></p><p>One can become obsessive about anything. Anything that may be
intelligent within boundaries may become neurotic if you stretch it too
far. Reaction is moving to the other extreme. Rebellion is a very deep
understanding, profound understanding, of a certain phenomenon. And
rebellion always keeps you in the middle; it gives you balance.</p><p><br></p><p>You are not to fight with anybody, the nuns and the priests and the
parents, outside or inner. You are not to fight with anybody, because in
a fight you will not know where to stop. In a fight one loses awareness;
in a fight one starts moving to the extreme. You can watch it.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, just sitting with your friends, by the way, you say,
“That movie I went to yesterday was not worth seeing.” You may have
mentioned it just by the way, but then somebody says, “You are wrong. I
have also seen the movie. It is one of the most beautiful pictures ever
made.” Now you are provoked, challenged; you become argumentative. You
say, “It is worthless, the most worthless thing!” And you start
criticizing. And if the other also insists, you become more and more
angry and you start saying things you have not even thought about. And
later on if you go backwards and see the whole phenomenon that had
happened, you will be surprised that when you had mentioned that it was
not worth going to, it was a very mild statement, but by the time you
finished with the argument, you had moved to the extreme. You had used
all that was possible, all the nasty words that you know. You could
condemn in any way; you used all your skill of condemnation. And you
were not ready to do it in the beginning. If nobody had opposed you, you
might have forgotten all about it, you might never have made such strong
statements.</p><p><br></p><p>It happens – when you start fighting you tend to move to the
extreme.</p><p><br></p><p>I am not teaching you to fight with your conditionings. Understand
them. Become more intelligent about them. Just see how they dominate
you, how they influence your behavior, how they have shaped your
personality, how they go on affecting you from the back door. Just
watch! Be meditative. And one day, when you have seen the working of
your conditionings, suddenly a balance is attained. In your very
understanding you are free.</p><p><br></p><p>Understanding is freedom, and that freedom I call rebellion.</p><p><br></p><p>The real rebel is not a fighter; he is a man of understanding. He
simply grows in intelligence, not in anger, not in rage. You cannot
transform yourself by being angry against your past. Then the past will
continue to dominate you, then the past will remain the center of your
being, the past will remain your focus. You will remain focused,
attached to the past. You may move to the very other extreme, but still
you will be attached to the past.</p><p><br></p><p>Beware of it! That is not the way of a meditator; that is not the way
of a sannyasin. Sannyas is rebellion – rebellion through understanding.
Just understand.</p><p><br></p><p>You pass by the side of a church and a deep desire arises in you to
go inside and pray. Or you pass by the side of a temple and
unconsciously you bow down to the deity of the temple. Just watch. Why
are you doing these things? I am not saying to fight. I am saying to
watch. Why do you bow</p><p>down to the temple? – because you were taught that this temple is the
right temple, that the deity of this temple is the real image of God. Do
you know? Or have you just been told and you have been following it?
Watch!</p><p><br></p><p>Seeing it, that you are just repeating a program that has been given
to you, that you are just playing a tape in your head, that you are
being automatic, robot-like, you will stop bowing. Not that you will
have to make any effort, you will simply forget all about it. It will
disappear, it will leave you without any trace.</p><p><br></p><p>In reaction the trace is there. In rebellion there is no trace; it is
utter freedom.</p><p><br></p><p>And you also ask, Premananda, “Who is to fight with whom?” Hmm? That
question arises only if it has to be a fight. Because it is not going to
be a fight, the question does not arise.</p><p><br></p><p>You have just to be a witness. And the witnessing is your original
face; the one who witnesses is your real consciousness. That which is
witnessed is conditioning. The one who witnesses is the divine source of
your being.</p><p><br></p><p>The sixth question:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 6</p><p><br></p><p>I WANT TO GIVE BIRTH TO A BUDDHA. THAT’S MY ONLY DESIRE IN LIFE, TO
BECOME THE MOTHER OF A BUDDHA. OSHO, IS IT POSSIBLE?</p><p><br></p><p>First become a Buddha; then maybe a Buddha is born out of you. But
the desire to give birth to a Buddha is utterly futile. That is again an
ego trip, that “I should become the mother of a Buddha.” The very desire
will be the hindrance.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, you can become a mother of a Buddha, but the first requirement
is :YOU become a Buddha. And it has also happened that a Buddha is born
to a woman who is not a Buddha. But one thing is certain: she was not
desiring. She may not have been a Buddha, but she was not desiring a
Buddha. Buddha can be born to a woman if there is no desire, if the
woman is innocent. Desire makes you cunning.</p><p><br></p><p>Now this desire is again an ambition. Somebody wants to become the
president of a country, somebody wants to be the richest man in the
world – you want to become the mother of a Buddha. Why?</p><p><br></p><p>All becoming, all desire for the future, is an extension of the ego.
And if there is such a desire, it will destroy your whole life. And then
it is futile too, because I have never heard, it is not reported
anywhere in any scripture of the world, that a woman wanted to give
birth to a Buddha and she succeeded.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddhas were born, but they were born to women who were completely
innocent, unaware. If you deliberately want to do it, there is no
possibility.</p><p>Become meditative, become more silent, more still, more loving, more
compassionate. Befriend existence, trust life, live in the moment, and
then whatsoever happens is good. If God wills a Buddha through you,
good; if he does not will a Buddha through you, that too is perfectly
good.</p><p><br></p><p>And even if a child born to you-becomes a Buddha, how is it going to
help you? How is it going to make you free? It is not going to help you
at all; you will remain in the same rut. You will go on moving in the
same vicious circle of life and death. Gautam Buddha’s mother has not
yet become a Buddha; Mahavira’s mother is still moving in the same
vicious circle, has not yet attained, so that is not going to help you
in any way.</p><p><br></p><p>And remember, when a soul enters into a woman’s womb, it can enter
only if the womb is suitable for it, if the womb somehow is harmonious
with the rhythm of the soul. To give birth to an Adolf Hitler a
different kind of mother is needed; to give birth to a Buddha, certainly
a different kind of mother is needed, because the womb attracts only
something harmonious to it, and the soul – a higher soul – can enter
only in a higher womb.</p><p><br></p><p>Drop all these desires. Start becoming a Buddha on your own. And then
it is possible, because Buddhas after all need wombs. And nothing is
wrong with your womb, but create a holy womb. Remember always the old
proverb, “The tree is known by the fruit.” Only a mango tree can give
mango fruits. You can know about the tree by the fruits. You cannot give
birth to something which you are not.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard:</p><p><br></p><p>An elderly widower had himself fitted out with a full set of monkey
glands, and a short while later remarried.</p><p><br></p><p>A year passed, and the night was an eventful one. Outside the bedroom
door paced up and down, up and down, the rejuvenated husband. At last a
door opened and the nurse appeared, but before the man could stop her
she had brushed past and was on her way downstairs. After a time the
doctor came out.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, tell me, doctor, tell me,” exclaimed the anxious husband, “is it
a boy or a girl?” “We don’t know yet,” answered the doctor.</p><p>“Don’t know yet?”</p><p><br></p><p>“No, we have not been able to get the little devil down off the
chandelier.” Now when you are fitted with monkey glands, what more can
you expect?</p><p>Create a climate within you, create a spring within you. Become
meditative, more and more meditative. And the first requirement of
becoming meditative is not to desire at all, not even for God. Not to
desire at all – that is the most fundamental principle of
meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>Desire always leads you into tense states of mind. Desire is tension;
non-desire is relaxation.</p><p>Forget all about the Buddha, and giving birth to a Buddha. Why should
you get in such a trouble? You become the Buddha; you owe it to
yourself. Your only responsibility is towards yourself. If some Buddha
wants to be born, he will find a way; that is his problem. He will find
a way and a womb. Why should you be worried?</p><p><br></p><p>But don’t waste your time in unnecessary desires. And watch. The mind
is so cunning, it can give you such beautiful desires, such spiritual
desires, that you almost forget that they are also desires, and desires
are desires. All desires are the same.</p><p><br></p><p>Now there are many women here – that’s why I have answered this
question – who are hoping that someday I will permit my sannyasins to
give birth to Buddhas. They go on writing letters to me that “Osho,
should I get sterilized or not? If someday you feel that I am ready to
give birth to a Buddha, then what, if I am sterilized? Should I
wait?”</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t bother. Buddhas will find their ways, and there are so many
women in the world. If you feel that it is going to help you on your own
spiritual path, in your own growth, then be sterilized. Nothing to be
worried about. If you feel this will keep you away from unnecessary
troubles and unnecessary responsibilities, it is perfectly good. Your
only responsibility is towards yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>You become a Buddha! I am here to help you to become Buddhas. Don’t
bother about becoming fathers and mothers of Buddhas. There are many
other foolish people who can do this.</p><p><br></p><p>The last question:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 7</p><p><br></p><p>WHY DO THE SUFIS DANCE?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, it is a pertinent question. Buddhists only sit silently. Why do
Sufis dance? Zen people only meditate, sitting silently, not doing a
thing, doing nothing – just sitting silently? spring comes, and the
grass grows by itself. But Sufis dance.</p><p><br></p><p>These are the two different paths, because there are two types of
energy in the world: the positive and the negative, male and female, yin
and yang. Zen people use the negative energy; they use the passive path.
Sufis use the positive energy; they use the active path. They are very
vibrant people. Their meditation is not of passivity; their meditation
is that of ecstasy.</p><p><br></p><p>Both are ways you can reach to the same goal, because the goal is
exactly in the middle. The positive is one extreme, the negative the
other extreme. Between the positive and the negative there is a middle
point, exactly in the middle, from where transformation happens – one
transcends the world and everything – from where one enters into God and
becomes God.</p><p><br></p><p>If you feel that you are on the negative pole already, a passive
type, then follow Zen and start moving deeply in your passivity, and one
day you will reach the middle. Or if you feel that you are an active
person, full of energy, youth, positivity, that sitting silently is very
difficult, unnecessarily a torture, then dance, follow the Sufis’
way.</p><p>And I go on speaking on Zen and Sufism again and again so that all
kinds of people are helped here. You have to choose. You have to watch
yourself, your energy, and then you choose. Both are valid ways, both
lead to the same goal.</p><p><br></p><p>Rumi says, “Hey I Drink this fine fiery wine, these needles of fire,
and fall so drunk that you will not wake on the Day of
Resurrection.”</p><p><br></p><p>The way of the Sufi is the way of the drunkard, the dancer, who
becomes almost intoxicated in his dancing, who is transported through
his dance. He is inebriated; his dance is psychedelic.</p><p><br></p><p>It is said that Mohammed once said to Ali, “You are of me, and I am
of you.” When he heard this, Ali became ecstatic and involuntarily
started dancing. What else can you do, when a man like Mohammed says to
you, “You are of me, and I am of you”? How to receive this? Ali did
well.</p><p><br></p><p>And remember, it is not anything that he did. It was involuntary. He
started dancing; out of ecstasy the dance started flowing.</p><p><br></p><p>Another time, Mohammed said to Jafar, “You are like me in both looks
and character.” Here again, in wajd, Jafar started dancing. What else to
do? When Mohammed must have looked into the eyes of Jafar, wajd,
samadhi, was created, the transfer beyond the scriptures happened. How
to receive this? How not to dance? It would have been impossible not to
dance. Jafar danced.</p><p><br></p><p>It is said, “The enrapturing of the Sufi by God, or rather the ‘pull’
of God, keeps the Sufi continually in spiritual, inner dance and
movement.<span class=s4></span>” It is not that the Sufi dances – God
keeps dancing in him.</p><p>What can he do?</p><p><br></p><p>“<span class=s4></span>Whenever a wave of such divine rapture
strikes the heart of the Sufi, it creates great waves in</p><p>the lake of his inner being.<span class=s4></span>” He is just a
receptacle. To say that the Sufi is dancing is not right. The</p><p>Sufi is being danced. He cannot help it, he is helpless. Something is
pouring into him and it is too much; it starts overflowing in his
dancing and singing.</p><p><br></p><p>“This, in turn, causes his body to move. Upon seeing such movement
non-Sufis have often supposed that the Sufi is dancing. In reality,
however, it is the waves of the ocean of God that are tossing and
turning the anchorless vessel that is the heart of the Sufi.”</p><p><br></p><p>On the surface, from the outside, the Sufi seems to be dancing. But
he is not dancing, because there is no dancer. It is pure dance. God has
taken possession of him. The Sufi is drunk, intoxicated. His state is
that of non-being. He is anchorless. The waves of the ocean toss and
turn. First his inner being is stirred, great joy arises there; and then
it starts spreading towards his body.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what you are doing with Aneeta; that’s what is happening to
Aneeta. You are participating in something immensely beautiful in Sufi
dancing. Remember it: forget the dancer and be the dance.</p><p><br></p><p>The way of the Sufi is the way of dance, song, celebration.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part13>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

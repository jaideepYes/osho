Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
DO POLITICIANS HAVE BRAINS?
I am sorry, but I doubt it. If one has brains there are so many beautiful things in life to do; it is impossible for such a man to be interested in politics at all.

If one has brains there are so many beautiful things in life to do; it is impossible for such a man to be interested in politics at all. Politics is for the lowest category of intellect. You can see it all over the world.\nI am reminded of one of my friends who was a national figure in politics. His whole life he devoted to two things: one, which was his priority, that cow slaughter should be stopped; and the second was, that Hindi should become the national language.\nI once asked him, “You go on calling the cow ‘the holy mother’; then who is the bull – the holy father?”\nHe became angry. I said, “It is a simple thing. If the cow is your mother, then the bull has to be your father.”\nHe said, “You always confuse me.”\nAnother time I asked him, “What about Charles Darwin’s theory that man is evolved out of monkeys?”\nHe said, “Absurd! Monkeys are animals, man is not. Man is divine. God has made man in His own image.”\nI said, “Then what about the cow? The monkey is an animal. You cannot accept that man evolves out of monkeys but you go on calling the cow your mother. Isn’t the cow an animal?”\nAnd, moreover, you reject the bull, the poor bull, who has done no harm to you except given you birth – without the bull the cow cannot be your mother. You should be all-grateful to the bull. You became angry on that point; now you are denying Charles Darwin’s theory simply because monkeys are animals – but what about the cow? Can’t you see such a simple logic? Then only one thing remains – which will be very absurd”\nHe said, “What? Nothing can be more absurd than Charles Darwin’s theory.”\nI said, “You just wait. The cow is the mother, and the monkey is the father and man is a cross-breed. It is not that I am saying it – it is you who should say it, but you are not capable of any intelligence. This is a simple thing. You have the mother; the father is missing – the bull is not acceptable. Charles Darwin has the father; the mother is missing. That is very strange of Charles Darwin too, that he talks about the male monkeys becoming man. Then who became the woman? Very strange – what about the female monkeys?\n“Charles Darwin nowhere mentions female monkeys. It is strange, a man who continually worked on the theory must have come across the question that, okay, the monkey becomes the man, but who becomes the woman? Female monkeys must become women, but there is no reference to them in Charles Darwin’s books. So the monkeys are our forefathers and cows are our foremothers.\n“I don’t know whether such a word exists or not and I don’t care either – I have never come across such a word as ‘foremothers’; but if ‘forefathers’ makes sense, then ‘foremothers’ also makes sense.”\nHe was so angry that he said, “You will never talk sense.”\nI said, “What can be more sensible? Man is a cross-breed – all the qualities of the cow, and all the qualities of the monkey. Man is so rich! No other animal is a cross-breed; that’s why man has become the supreme-most, the highest animal in the world.”\nAnd this man – Seth Govindas was his name – was respected all over the country; but he couldn’t see simple things.\nIn India there are thirty languages of almost equal importance. There are a few differences; for example, Hindi is spoken by more people, but Bengali has a far richer literature, more refined language. Just to hear two Bengalis talking is such an experience in itself. Their language is so sweet, every word is so rounded.\nI had one Bengali girl as my post-graduate student. In Hindi her name would be Rama. Rama means beautiful, attractive, but when I asked her her name – she was a Bengali – she said, “Roma.” I tried hard” Roma? Has it something to do with Rome?” She said, “No, it is your Hindi ‘Rama,’ but\nin Bengali it becomes Roma.” Roma certainly is more romantic; Rama looks hard, harsh, clear-cut but not rounded.\nBengalis have their claim that they have the best literature, not only in India, but perhaps in the whole world – a great tradition of the best poetry.\nWhat does it mean, just counting numbers? Hindi may be spoken by many people; the numbers are not much different. If Pakistan had not been divided from India then Bengali would have been spoken by more people than Hindi, because half of Bengal went into Pakistan. Otherwise Bengali is spoken by more people than Hindi. So it is just a political accident that the country got divided and half of Bengal became Bangladesh and half of Bengal remained in India. But if you look at world languages, Bengali will come before Hindi.\nBut numbers don’t count. Tamil has its own literature, far more ancient than the literature of Sanskrit, because the people of South India are the original Indians. The people of North India are invaders. The people of North India who speak Hindi, Bengali, Gujarati are all Aryans. They are blood brothers of the French, Italians, Germans, English, Swedish, Russians, but they have no relationship of blood with the South Indians. South Indians have a blood relationship with the negroes.\nThere was a time when Africa and India were connected. It is now a well-known fact that continents go on shifting – they are not stable. You just cut out the maps of India and Africa and put them together and you will be surprised – they fit perfectly. The south of India fits perfectly with the lines of Africa. Some time in the past the land parted; Africa shifted away, over thousands of years.\nSouth Indians are negroid, their blood is connected with the negroes; their skin is black, their language has no connection with Sanskrit at all. You will be surprised: Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Kannad – the four main languages of South India – have not a single word from Sanskrit, while Russian has forty percent, German has sixty percent, Lithuanian has seventy percent, English has thirty percent. French, Swedish – all the European languages originated predominantly from Sanskrit.\nNaturally, South India does not want to be dominated by a Sanskrit-originated language, Hindi. They have no connection with it.\nI told Seth Govindas, “These are simple facts. This country cannot have a national language. Just as Russian has no national language, the country can have only provincial languages. And it can use one language, for example English – because English is only understood by two percent of Indians, but those two percent of Indians are spread all over India, in every language group. So English remains a link language, not a national language, because two percent of the people speaking it cannot make it a national language. But it can become a link language.\n“Every language has its own state, its own independence, so that it can grow independently without any pressure from any other language. There is no need for a national language, just a link language so that all these thirty languages don’t fall apart.” That’s how in Russia ... Russian is only a link language. The same is the problem in Russia: thirty six languages, so widely apart – you cannot impose one language as the national language.\nIndia is not a small country like England or Switzerland or France; it is a sub-continent. England can have one language, but a sub-continent cannot have one language. You cannot impose it – and for thirty years, forty years continuously, they have been trying. English remains the national language and there is no hope of an Indian national language ever.\nI told that old man, “Just see the facts.”\nBut certainly politicians don’t have brains.\nIn India I knew many politicians, but I have not seen any brains in them.\nSimple things that anybody will understand, things which don’t need great genius, politicians will miss. One of my friends was commander-in-chief of the Indian armies. When Pakistan invaded India, this man – his name was General Chaudhuri – asked permission of the prime minister to counter attack; it was needed, just being defensive would not help. That’s a simple military strategy: if you become defensive you are already defeated; the best way is to be aggressive.\nIf Pakistan has invaded one part of Kashmir, Chaudhuris idea was that we invade Pakistan from four or five fronts. They will be confused, they will run amok; they will not be able to decide where they have to send their armies. Their attack will become a failure because they have to defend all the borders of their country.\nBut politicians. The prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, informed him, “Wait till six o’clock in the morning.”\nGeneral Chaudhuri told me that he was thrown out of the army – not publicly: publicly he retired honorably, but he was kicked out. He was told, “Either you resign or we will throw you out.”\nThe reason was that he attacked Pakistan at five o’clock in the morning, one hour before the order. That was the right time; by six o’clock it would be sunrise, people would be awake. Five o’clock was the perfectly right time – everybody was asleep – to drive them crazy. And he did what he was saying – he made the whole of Pakistan tremble. He was just fifteen miles from Pakistan’s biggest city, Lahore.\nThe whole night Jawaharlal and his cabinet were discussing this way and that way, to do it or not to do it. And even by six o’clock in the morning they had not come to any conclusion; they just heard on the radio that “General Chaudhuri is entering Lahore.”\nThat was too much for the politicians. They stopped him just fifteen miles away from Lahore. And I can see that was sheer stupidity. If the man had taken Lahore, the problem of Kashmir and India would have been solved forever. It is not ever going to be solved, the problem of the territory of Kashmir which Pakistan has occupied – and it was because General Chaudhuri was told to come back, “because India is a non-violent country and you did not wait for the order.”\nHe said to them, “I do understand military strategy; you don’t. Even by six o’clock – where was your order? Pakistan has already occupied a certain territory, the most beautiful part of Kashmir – and you were just discussing the whole night. This is not a question to be discussed, this has to be decided in the warfield. If you had allowed me to take over Lahore then we would have been in a position to bargain. Now we are not in a position to bargain. You pulled me back, I had to come back.”\nThe U.N. decided for a cease-fire line. So now for forty years, U.N. armies have been there patrolling; on the other side Pakistans armies are patrolling, on this side Indian armies are patrolling. For forty years – just nonsense! And in the UNO they go on discussing and nothing comes out of it.\nAnd the territory that has been occupied by Pakistan you cannot take back because of the cease- fire. They have really decided in their parliament that the territory occupied by them is combined with Pakistan. Now they show it on their maps. It is no longer occupied territory, it is Pakistan’s territory.\nI had told General Chaudhuri, “This was such a simple thing, that you have to be in a bargaining position. If you had taken Lahore they would have immediately agreed to leave Kashmir because they could not lose Lahore. Or if a cease-fire was to come, okay, then Lahore remains with us when we cease fire. Either way there will be something to bargain. India doesn’t have anything to bargain with – why should Pakistan bother?”\nBut politicians certainly don’t have brains.\nI was thinking that perhaps this is applicable only to Indian politicians, but coming to Oregon I was really surprised because I saw greater idiots.\nJust the other day Oregon’s assembly decided that the post office of the City of Rajneesh will continue to be called the post office of Antelope. Now can you see the foolishness? Antelope is dead; there is no longer any Antelope anywhere, the people of Antelope buried it. But the post office should be called the post office of Antelope.\nThe city is called the City of Rajneesh. It has no post office. The real, the living city, has no post office; the dead, the unreal city has the post office. And naturally the postmaster goes on rejecting all mail that comes in the name of the City of Rajneesh because it is the post office of Antelope. Can you think these politician have brains?\nIf they wanted to destroy the City of Rajneesh they should have had the guts, and they should have resolved in the assembly that the City of Rajneesh should be again called Antelope. That would have been logical, and the post office would certainly be the post office of Antelope. Or they should have changed the name of the post office.\nBoth were logical. But what they have done – the city they cannot touch because it is against the constitution. The people of the city have changed the name. They have the right to change the name; that is their constitutional right. The majority decided to change it, and the assembly cannot interfere.\nBut those idiots think that they can at least save the post office, the post office of Antelope – and nobody in that assembly asked, “When the city is no longer there ... how can there be a post office of a city which is non-existential?” And this is going to create unnecessary problems.\nI would like my people to go to court first against the postmaster general of America – because it is just a simple rule that whenever a city changes its name, within one month the post office has to change its name. But a year has passed and we have been asking the postmaster general and he has been delaying. He must have been waiting for these politicians to decide in the assembly.\nSo first go against the postmaster general, asking why he delayed for one year when the simple rule is one month. And who is he to decide that the post office should continue to be called Antelope’s\npost office? Then go against the assembly also; their decision is stupid. Either change the name of the city if you have guts – go against the constitution – or if you don’t have guts then let the post office name be changed.\nBut politicians don’t show any sign of brains.\nI am reminded of a story. A great politician had developed a tumor in his brain, perhaps a canceric growth. It was a very complicated operation, his whole brain had to be taken out. He was lying down on the table; it was a long and very delicate operation. The doctors were operating on the brain in another room. When the operation was over, they came back to take the politician ... he was missing! “My God, where has he gone?”\nThe nurse said, “A man came running and he said, ‘You have been chosen the president.’ The patient stood up and started walking. I tried to prevent him, I said, ‘Your brain is in the surgery, and they are working on it.’ He said, ‘Now that I am the president I don’t need the brain. Let them work on it. Whenever I need it I will come, but at least for five years forget all about it. I am the president; brains are needed by small people, nobodies. Where is the need for brains for a man who has risen to the highest post?’”\nThe whole of history proves it, that politicians have been the most idiotic people around. But the strange fact is that the more idiotic the politician is, the more possibility there is for his success. That’s what happened in Adolf Hitler’s case.\nPerhaps Adolf Hitler was the most idiotic politician ever, but he went on succeeding. He went on conquering countries. It was an amazing phenomenon. The reason is very strange. He knew nothing of military science – that was the reason for his success. His generals would tell him that this is absolutely wrong, this step is absolutely wrong.\nBut he never listened to the generals, he listened to the astrologers. He had his astrologers who said, “This is the right time – move into France, move into Poland, or move anywhere.” That was decided by the astrologers and the stars, not by military science. Naturally he baffled everybody. If he had moved according to military science, then on the other side the same military science is known.\nIf he had bombed London according to military science, then London would have been ready and prepared. But it was being decided by the stars, by an idiot astrologer. His generals were absolutely impotent. They could see that this was nonsense, but this nonsense was succeeding so they also slowly slowly became silent: “Perhaps he is right.”\nYou will be surprised that Churchill had to call astrologers from India – because Western astrology is different from Eastern astrology. These are just fictions, so there can be as many astrologies as you want. Stars don’t care about you, so you can manage anything. They don’t object either, they don’t have any idea that you are here.\nI have heard: one elephant was passing across a bridge and a small fly was sitting on top of the head of the elephant. When they were just in the middle of the bridge – the bridge was not made for elephants to cross; it was a poor village, and a poor bridge temporarily made for the rainy season – the bridge started shaking. The fly said, “Uncle, our weight is too much.”\nThe elephant heard some buzzing noise. He said, “Just say it loudly – who are you? And where are you?”\nThe fly said, “I am just sitting on your head and our weight is too much.”\nThe elephant said, “My God, I was not even aware that you were here.” But the fly included itself; He said, “Our weight is shaking the bridge.”\nMan is not even a fly so far as stars are concerned. And people are such ... they ask the astrologers, “What time will it be good to start a business; are the stars in the right position? When will it be good to get married; are the stars in the right position?” All stars are in the right position – but all marriages are in the wrong position. This is enough proof that stars don’t care about you, they don’t know about you. But you can create fictions. Churchill did not ask the Western astrologers because they would give him the same advice as was being given to Adolf Hitler. That wouldn’t be the right thing. Churchill understood why this man was succeeding. He was succeeding because whenever they expected him to attack, he never attacked. And whenever they never expected, could never conceive, there he attacked.\nIt was a simple rule of war that you attack at the weakest point. It is so obvious; you don’t attack the enemy at his strongest point. But those astrologers don’t know what is a weak point and what is a strong point. They look towards the stars – and the stars have no idea that there is a war going on.\nHe called those astrologers from India; the war took a turn, because now Churchill was also functioning like a fool. He was also no longer listening to his generals. He said, “You keep out of it – because that man is mad. He knows no military science and it is not going to help. Now astrology is going to help.” And astrology did help. Poor Adolf Hitler was defeated. He was succeeding because of astrology – he was defeated because of astrology.\nBut the man was absolutely an idiot about everything. When Germany started retreating, the generals would not inform him, “We are being defeated,” because any general who said that would be shot immediately. Adolf Hitler could not be defeated, so this general must have gone mad.”\nWhen the bombs were falling on Berlin itself, just outside the house where Adolf Hitler was living in the basement, then too the German radio continued to say that “we are winning all over the world.” Nobody was ready to get shot unnecessarily – what was the point? This man was not going to listen.\nAdolf Hitler thought himself almost a demigod. His word was the law, and if he said that he was going to conquer the world, it was going to happen. The bombs were falling outside his house; he could hear the buildings falling, people crying, the noise, the explosions, still he was consulting the astrologers: “Which country are we going to invade next?” To the very last moment he was convinced he was winning. Can you think that a man who has a little bit of brain would be so thick?\nBut other politicians are not different either – maybe more of less, but the brain is not the business of the politician. The politician has to be stubborn, adamant, fanatic; these are the qualities that make him succeed. He has to be foolish enough to believe that he has, by birth, a determined future, a destiny. He is the man of destiny. Only fools can believe that.\nThe more intelligent you are, the less stubborn, the less fanatic; more thinking, doubting, more skeptical. Skeptical about yourself – you cannot think of yourself as a man of destiny. You cannot think that you are born to dominate the world.\nAnd these people are what our whole history is about. Our whole history needs to be burned, completely burned, erased. We should start writing from ABC again, because this history is being taught to every child. And these people are called Alexander the Great, Genghis the Great Khan, Ivan the Terrible – and they are praised, their qualities are praised. And much of the praise is just fiction because those histories were written by their court clerks. Those court clerks who were writing those histories were paid. The better the praise, the more they were paid.\nOne of the great emperors in India was Akbar. He was making a new capital. He wanted to shift the capital from Delhi to a fresh capital, completely newly-made. His whole life he poured as much money into it as possible – and he created a city, Fateh-pur Sikri – a beautiful city, almost a miracle city. All stonework .…\nHe gathered all the best stone artists and craftsmen from the world, and the best stones, marble. He made the whole city his whole life. Nobody has ever lived in it, because to create a capital so that the whole of Delhi could be shifted in just a single moveAkbar died and Fateh-pur Sikri remains\nincomplete, although a vast city. So much money wasted, such huge and beautiful buildings, each inch a piece of art – but for what? Nobody has ever lived there. Nobody is going to live there ever, for the simple reason that when the city was made nobody thought of water. Nobody thought that many more things are needed when people live there – land is needed for crops .…\nIt is a very weird experience to be in Fateh-pur Sikri, a city made with so much money. I think no other city has ever been made in that way – and nobody ever lived in it. It was a ghost town from the very beginning, and it is going to remain a ghost town.\nEven now thousands of people can be accommodated there, but other necessities are not available. And Akbar never went there to see what was happening. He wanted to wait for it to be completed; then he would go there. Akbar is thought to have been one of the intelligent emperors, but I don’t think so. What kind of intelligence is this?\nThere was another Mohammedan emperor who almost surpassed Akbar. He simply ordered the whole of Delhi to move – from Delhi thousands of miles away to Aurangabad. Aurangabad was very close to Poona.\nNow his order had to be followed, the whole city had to be emptied immediately. It was a military operation. Everybody was thrown out of his house; the whole of Delhi was emptied – almost half a million people moving thousands of miles, not knowing what was going to happen in Aurangabad. And nothing was prepared there!\nAt least Akbar had planned the city, made the city. Aurangabad was a small place. Where were these people going to live? And nobody bothered about their food supply for this whole journey. It took months; almost eighty percent of the people died, twenty percent reached Aurangabad. And you can think in what condition they were if eighty percent died on the way.\nThose twenty percent had become sick, old. The journey took at least ten years from their life. They were utterly wiped out – in fact, feeling jealous of those who had died, because it was so terrible to live. And then in Aurangabad there was no space and that idiot king said, “No, this is not the right place – we should go back.” The whole journey again! This man’s name was Muhammad Tughlak.\nDo you think these type of people have any brains? By the time they reached Delhi almost everybody was dead. Delhi was empty; it became a military camp. And all this for no reason at all! The only reason was that Muhammad Tughlak’s father had died in Aurangabad and he wanted Aurangabad to be made the capital of India in his memory.\nBut to make a capital for half a million people, to move them thousands of miles – and trains were not there, buses were not there. People were moving by foot, on camels, on horses, on donkeys, on bullock carts. And nobody bothered about how the food was to be managed for the whole journey, how water was to be managedAnd they had to pass through the whole desert of Rajasthan,\nwhere most of the people died, just because of thirst.\nIf you look at history you will be surprised – why do we go on teaching these people’s lives to our children, why do we contaminate our children? What is the point?\nI feel that politics and politicians should be completely debarred as far as the education of the new generation is concerned. The new generation should be helped to forget the whole past so they can start living anew.\nThere is a saying that history repeats itself. Yes, it repeats itself because you go on teaching it. Just stop teaching history and it won’t repeat any more.\nYou teach it, you poison the minds of children, and they start having political ambitions themselves. You make them ambitious. In every possible way you make them ambitious.\nYour whole education system is not to make children intelligent but to make them ambitious. Yes, you try to make them intellectuals – that too is a help for being ambitious.\nIf they are intelligent they won’t be ambitious at all. If they are intelligent they would like to live a very simple and ordinary life in tune with nature, in harmony with existence, with trees, with birds, with animals, with people. They would not like to dominate anyone or be dominated by anyone. They would like to live together in friendliness, not as masters or slaves.\nThere can never be a friendship between the owner and the owned, the boss and the servant, the leader and the led. There can never be any friendship. Friendship can happen only when there is a very subtle undeclared form of equality – not the equality communism talks about, because that is politics, that is forced equality.\nI have heardthere was a very strange Greek king who had a very beautiful, very precious, golden\nbed, made of twenty-four carat gold, studded with diamonds and all kinds of precious stones. It was\nkept only for guests. But whosoever was unfortunate enough to be his guest never came out of the King’s guest house alive because he was determined on one point: the guest had to fit his bed. His bed was so precious that if the guest was a little longer, then cut his feet off; if needed, cut off his head – but make him to the size of the bed. If he was a little smaller, then stretch him. Perhaps this king was the man who invented traction.\nThey used traction on me. When I first heard about traction I started wondering, from where does this word “traction” come? I found that it comes from Christian churches of the Middle Ages where they used to torture people, pulling them from both sides – hands on one side, legs on the other – to confess that they were in contact with devils, with witches, that nuns were having intercourse with the devil, that monks were having intercourse with ghosts ... all kinds of things. And unless you confessed, this traction would continue.\nIt was by chance that a monk had a bad back; and when they did this traction to him, he confessed, and he also said, “One thing more: my back was bad and I have been suffering for years; your traction has been a great blessing to me. I am grateful; my back is perfectly okay, I can walk!” That’s how this traction came – it is a religious device used by medical science.\nBut that Greek king was even more ancient, he was really the pioneer. People got killed in both cases, because it was very, very difficult to find a person exactly the same size as his bed. And he was a king – no ordinary person was going to be his guest, only very extraordinary people.\nThe bed was not made according to anybody’s size, so everybody was either too long or too short. Everybody came out dead in the morning. From his guest house nobody came back alive because he never could find a man who could fit his bed. And the bed was so precious that people’s lives did not matter at all.\nThese people have dominated humanity – they are still dominating humanity. Their whole game is one of retarded minds.\nIt is time we burned the whole of history and started from the very beginning, fresh. That’s my whole work with you.\nTalking to you I am really trying to burn your conditionings, trying to remove all the rubbish that you have been carrying your whole life ... just trying to clean you and make you utterly blank so that you can start sprouting your self – otherwise you are so full of junk that there is no space for your self.\nI used to stay in a very rich man’s house in Indore. The man was certainly one of the richest men in the world. I don’t know anybody who has been given as many titles as that man. In India Seth is a title which is given to super-rich people. He was called Sir Seth, not just ordinary Seth, Seth of the Seths: Sir Seth means above the head, the chief. And he was the only man who has ever been called Sir Seth in the whole of history.\nAnd he had so many titles .… When you saw his letterhead, you could not believe it: Sir Seth, Raoraja Sir, knight and whatnot; everything was there. And he had a huge palace, but so full of junk\n– precious junk, but junk after all, is junk. Everything that came into the market anywhere in the world was immediately purchased, and things went on gathering in his palace.\nHe asked me, “How do you like it?”\nI said, “I just wonder if I can get out of this palace alive, because there is no space to live in this place. You cannot move!” I took him to my bedroom, that was his best room. I said, “You just look\n– you move anywhere and you stumble into something.” All models of television, all models of radio were there, and I said, “Television has not come to Indore yet – why possess these sets?”\nHe said, “That is my order to all of my offices around the world: anything new, purchase immediately for the palace.”\nUseless models of television sets ... I said to him, “One day I would like to go around your whole palace with you, because if this is the situation of the guest house, I would like to know what the situation of the host is. It must be worse.” And it was.\nThis guest house was a small house in the garden; between the garden and the palace there were beautiful fountains and trees and lawns, and then his palace. The first floor was full of horses! I said, “My God! Do you like riding?”\nHe said, “No.”\nI said, “Then what are these horses doing here?” – and such beautiful horses I have never seen.\nHe said, “Just my orders. Anywhere, any beautiful horse, immediately it has to be purchased.” Rare horses I have seen but nothing to be compared to Sir Hukumchand’s horses. Then elephants in one corner; in another corner, camels – and they stink!\nI said, “Sir Seth, you must be going crazy with all this stink.”\nHe said, “No; in fact I have become so accustomed to it I don’t go anywhere because I can’t sleep without this fragrance.”\nHe had to feel that in the whole world he was the only man – that was his liking. He wanted, in everything, to be at the top. He had one Rolls Royce made of solid gold; it is still there. It was useless because he was afraid to take it out – it was dangerous. It was too costly – all solid gold, completely; even the mechanism inside was solid gold. It never moved, it simply remained in a showcase.\nI said, “What is the point?”\nHe said, “The point is that I am the only person in the whole world”\nI said, “That is very easy, it can be done in a very simple way. Just shave half your hair, and you will be the only man in the whole world with half the head shaved. Why waste so much money? Just cut half of your moustache and you will be a walking exhibition. This car is stuck here – people have\ncome to see it. They will not need to come anymore. You go to the temple, you go to the office; wherever you will go, your half-moustache will declare that you are the only man in the whole world\n.…\nThe palace was three-storied – not even space to go into the rooms which were fully packed with strange things; even he had no idea what they were, but they had been purchased because they had come new in the market.\nI told him, “Sir Seth, your palace represents exactly the mind of people. You have money so you can fill your palace with all kinds of junk. People don’t have that much money so they fill their minds – that is cheaper – with all kinds of junk.”\nAnd politicians particularly do this because the politician has to deal with the lowest mob. He has to descend to the lowest, only then can he communicate. And slowly slowly he becomes that person – retarded, mediocre, having a mob psychology. You become that which you go on practicing continuously.\nYou ask me, “Do politicians have brains?”\nI can only say what I have experienced and seen. Certainly the question will arise, because if I say they don’t have any brains then how do they go on working? They go on working just like computers, just like robots. They go on working, not intelligently, but mechanically.\nTwo thousand years of history we know clearly, with evidence. One thing comes out absolutely clearly, that all political leaders have functioned mechanically. That’s why history is repeated – because of the mechanical behavior of the politicians. It is the same wheel that goes on moving: the same ambition, the same desire, the same strategy, the same tricks, the same exploitations – and the same results.\nBut now the game has come to a point where either the game has to finish or humanity has to be ready to commit suicide.\nThe game is not so precious, the game is just worthless. Humanity cannot be sacrificed to the political game.\nHuman individuals should start declaring that the earth is one, the whole of humanity is one; that we don’t want any nations, we don’t want this dirty politics; that we don’t see any problem, why Russia should be against America, or America be against Russia.\nThe Russian people are as innocent and simple as Americans. It is just the topmost politicians who cannot let you relax, because your relaxation is their death. They want you to remain continuously tense, afraid, so that they go on playing the game that “the war is coming and we have to prepare for it.”\nI want my people to declare that there is going to be no war and we are not going to be participants in it, that this war is absolute absurdity.\nAnd it is good that politics has brought you to this logical conclusion. Without it there would be no hope of getting rid of politicians. Now there is a chance, and we should not miss it. It is so glaringly clear that it is a question of either/or.\nEither the politicians remain or humanity remains.\nAnd this is where politicians themselves have dragged us. They cannot back out, there is no way back. Life only goes on forwards, never backwards. And they are all pushing towards war – reluctantly, afraid, because they are going to be killed in it themselves.\nIt is time that consciousness be raised, that people be made alert and aware that the question is no longer of communism or democracy, Russia or America; the question is politics, or religion. And when I say religion I don’t mean religions. When I say religion I mean religiousness.\nThe religions are all fictitious.\nJust the other day I was talking to you about three fools visiting at the birth of Jesus Christ, coming from the East to touch his feet. But the story is so fictitious that I would like you to be reminded of one thing: what led them to the place where Jesus was born, in an unknown corner of Bethlehem, in a stable?\nThe story says that a great star led the way. They followed the star and then the star stopped, just on top of the stable, so they knew Jesus was there, and they went in. This star makes the whole thing clearly fictitious, because stars don’t move in a direct line. They don’t move in any other way than in orbit; every star moves in a circle.\nAnd the stars are so far away that it would be very difficult to decide which stable the star was above! They are millions and millions of miles away. The distance is so great ... but the story sounds as if the star was just sitting on the roof of the stable; only then would it have been possible. But do you know, stars are very huge, they cannot come that low; otherwise the whole earth would be destroyed, with Jesus Christ included.\nOur sun is a star. It is sixty thousand times bigger than this earth – and this sun is a very mediocre star. There are stars which you see in the sky which are millions of times bigger than our sun.\nNow, a star leading the way seems almost like somebody holding a torch ahead, or a lamp, and then coming to the stable and telling them, “This is the stable.” Stars can’t do that. They cannot move out of their orbit – even for Jesus Christ they won’t do it.\nBut all religions are fictitious.\nJust as there are science fictions there are religious fictions.\nAll holy scriptures are religious fictions, and not of first grade quality. In fact, they cannot be counted as great literature – only fragments are great.\nFor example, in the whole of the Old Testament, just one small piece can be counted as literature, all else is rubbish. That small piece is “The Song of Solomon,” which Jews don’t even want to talk\nabout – and that is the only important thing in their whole scripture! But they want to ignore it for the simple reason that Solomon certainly seems to be a wise man, certainly a religious man; a man of tremendous sensibility, aesthetic, moral; a man who knows what beauty is, what poetry is.\nExcept for that small piece, everything else is only worth burning. In the New Testament, just a small piece, “The Sermon on the Mount,” is enough for Jesus to be counted as a man of some worth. All else is just written for the mob. The same is true about other religions.\nSo when I say religion I simply mean the religious consciousness: a certain quality – not a certain dogma, not a creed, not a cult, not something organized but something felt deep in the heart, something closer to when you see in the morning a beautiful sunrise .… You feel something, something is stirred in you. You cannot express it, you cannot tell anybody what you are feeling. All you can do is, you can hold the other person, and with your finger you can show the sunrise without saying a single word.\nIf the man has any aesthetic sense, any sensibility, he may be able to feel it; otherwise there is no way. You cannot argue, you cannot make a statement, you cannot do a commentary. You can only point it out ... fingers pointing to the moon.\nAll religious sages have only pointed to the moon. And all organized religions have caught hold of the fingers, forgotten all about the moon, and are worshiping the fingers. Now, the fingers are not the moon – they never were.\nIn Kashmir there is one hair of Hazrat Mohammed which is worshipped. A few years ago, the hair was stolen. Now there was great turmoil; riots happened, because certainly some Hindu must have stolen it. Many people were killed, many houses were burned, many temples destroyed, many mosques were burned. And after three days the hair was found back in its place. I know for certain it is not the same hair.\nBut what difference does it make? To the idiots ... who knows whether the first hair was of Hazrat Mohammed or not? And even if it was of Hazrat Mohammed, what does it matter?\nIn Kandi in Ceylon there is a huge temple, one of the most important in Ceylon – important because it has one too of Gautam Buddha. I have been to Kandi. The tooth is not of Gautam Buddha, for the simple reason that it is not a human tooth at all! It is so big – and I got it confirmed from people who understand animals, man. I had taken a vet with me. He said, “It is certainly of some animal; it cannot be of a man in any way.”\nAnd now it is confirmed by other sources also that it is from some animal. But it makes no difference; every year the festival continues, millions of Buddhists go on worshipping.\nOrganized religion clings to fingers. Fingers are not in the moon.\nIf you really want to see the moon you will have to forget the fingers completely; otherwise fingers will come in between you and the moon. They have to be ignored. They have done their work, they have indicated; say goodbye to them.\nReligious consciousness is a receptivity, a vulnerability to the existence that surrounds you, so alive that if you are open, its living vibes start moving within you, dancing within you. It is so full of joy – just you are closed. It is overflowing with bliss – just you are not there to receive it.\nReligious consciousness means receptivity to the joy the universe is made of. Yes, that is the stuff the universe is made of.\nAny intelligent person is of necessity going to be religious.\nPolitics is only for idiots. Its day is finished. We have to begin a new history in which there will be no place for politics. We want to get rid of all this retardedness, this mediocrity. We want the earth to become really the very cream of the whole universe. It can become, it has the potential. Unfortunately we have not used it. But the time has come – and I am preparing you to use it.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"7659","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/from_darkness_to_light/part28/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/from_darkness_to_light/>From Darkness to Light</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">28 Either politicians remain or humanity remains</h1><div class=post-meta>36 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;7659 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/From_Darkness_to_Light/part28.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part27>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

If one has brains there are so many
beautiful things in life to do; it is impossible for such a man to be
interested in politics at all. Politics is for the lowest category of
intellect. You can see it all over the world.</p><p><br></p><p>I am reminded of one of my friends who was a national figure in
politics. His whole life he devoted to two things: one, which was his
priority, that cow slaughter should be stopped; and the second was, that
Hindi should become the national language.</p><p><br></p><p>I once asked him, “You go on calling the cow ‘the holy mother’; then
who is the bull – the holy father?”</p><p><br></p><p>He became angry. I said, “It is a simple thing. If the cow is your
mother, then the bull has to be your father.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “You always confuse me.”</p><p><br></p><p>Another time I asked him, “What about Charles Darwin’s theory that
man is evolved out of monkeys?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Absurd! Monkeys are animals, man is not. Man is divine. God
has made man in His own image.”</p><p>I said, “Then what about the cow? The monkey is an animal. You cannot
accept that man evolves out of monkeys but you go on calling the cow
your mother. Isn’t the cow an animal?”</p><p><br></p><p>And, moreover, you reject the bull, the poor bull, who has done no
harm to you except given you birth – without the bull the cow cannot be
your mother. You should be all-grateful to the bull. You became angry on
that point; now you are denying Charles Darwin’s theory simply because
monkeys are animals – but what about the cow? Can’t you see such a
simple logic? Then only one thing remains – which will be very
absurd<span class=s4></span>”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “What? Nothing can be more absurd than Charles Darwin’s
theory.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “You just wait. The cow is the mother, and the monkey is the
father and man is a cross-breed. It is not that I am saying it – it is
you who should say it, but you are not capable of any intelligence. This
is a simple thing. You have the mother; the father is missing – the bull
is not acceptable. Charles Darwin has the father; the mother is missing.
That is very strange of Charles Darwin too, that he talks about the male
monkeys becoming man. Then who became the woman? Very strange – what
about the female monkeys?</p><p><br></p><p>“Charles Darwin nowhere mentions female monkeys. It is strange, a man
who continually worked on the theory must have come across the question
that, okay, the monkey becomes the man, but who becomes the woman?
Female monkeys must become women, but there is no reference to them in
Charles Darwin’s books. So the monkeys are our forefathers and cows are
our foremothers.</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t know whether such a word exists or not and I don’t care
either – I have never come across such a word as ‘foremothers’; but if
‘forefathers’ makes sense, then ‘foremothers’ also makes sense.”</p><p><br></p><p>He was so angry that he said, “You will never talk sense.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “What can be more sensible? Man is a cross-breed – all the
qualities of the cow, and all the qualities of the monkey. Man is so
rich! No other animal is a cross-breed; that’s why man has become the
supreme-most, the highest animal in the world.”</p><p><br></p><p>And this man – Seth Govindas was his name – was respected all over
the country; but he couldn’t see simple things.</p><p><br></p><p>In India there are thirty languages of almost equal importance. There
are a few differences; for example, Hindi is spoken by more people, but
Bengali has a far richer literature, more refined language. Just to hear
two Bengalis talking is such an experience in itself. Their language is
so sweet, every word is so rounded.</p><p><br></p><p>I had one Bengali girl as my post-graduate student. In Hindi her name
would be Rama. Rama means beautiful, attractive, but when I asked her
her name – she was a Bengali – she said, “Roma.” I tried hard<span class=s4></span>” Roma? Has it something to do with Rome?” She said,
“No, it is your Hindi ‘Rama,’ but</p><p>in Bengali it becomes Roma.” Roma certainly is more romantic; Rama
looks hard, harsh, clear-cut but not rounded.</p><p><br></p><p>Bengalis have their claim that they have the best literature, not
only in India, but perhaps in the whole world – a great tradition of the
best poetry.</p><p>What does it mean, just counting numbers? Hindi may be spoken by many
people; the numbers are not much different. If Pakistan had not been
divided from India then Bengali would have been spoken by more people
than Hindi, because half of Bengal went into Pakistan. Otherwise Bengali
is spoken by more people than Hindi. So it is just a political accident
that the country got divided and half of Bengal became Bangladesh and
half of Bengal remained in India. But if you look at world languages,
Bengali will come before Hindi.</p><p><br></p><p>But numbers don’t count. Tamil has its own literature, far more
ancient than the literature of Sanskrit, because the people of South
India are the original Indians. The people of North India are invaders.
The people of North India who speak Hindi, Bengali, Gujarati are all
Aryans. They are blood brothers of the French, Italians, Germans,
English, Swedish, Russians, but they have no relationship of blood with
the South Indians. South Indians have a blood relationship with the
negroes.</p><p><br></p><p>There was a time when Africa and India were connected. It is now a
well-known fact that continents go on shifting – they are not stable.
You just cut out the maps of India and Africa and put them together and
you will be surprised – they fit perfectly. The south of India fits
perfectly with the lines of Africa. Some time in the past the land
parted; Africa shifted away, over thousands of years.</p><p><br></p><p>South Indians are negroid, their blood is connected with the negroes;
their skin is black, their language has no connection with Sanskrit at
all. You will be surprised: Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Kannad – the four
main languages of South India – have not a single word from Sanskrit,
while Russian has forty percent, German has sixty percent, Lithuanian
has seventy percent, English has thirty percent. French, Swedish – all
the European languages originated predominantly from Sanskrit.</p><p><br></p><p>Naturally, South India does not want to be dominated by a
Sanskrit-originated language, Hindi. They have no connection with
it.</p><p><br></p><p>I told Seth Govindas, “These are simple facts. This country cannot
have a national language. Just as Russian has no national language, the
country can have only provincial languages. And it can use one language,
for example English – because English is only understood by two percent
of Indians, but those two percent of Indians are spread all over India,
in every language group. So English remains a link language, not a
national language, because two percent of the people speaking it cannot
make it a national language. But it can become a link language.</p><p><br></p><p>“Every language has its own state, its own independence, so that it
can grow independently without any pressure from any other language.
There is no need for a national language, just a link language so that
all these thirty languages don’t fall apart.” That’s how in Russia ...
Russian is only a link language. The same is the problem in Russia:
thirty six languages, so widely apart – you cannot impose one language
as the national language.</p><p><br></p><p>India is not a small country like England or Switzerland or France;
it is a sub-continent. England can have one language, but a
sub-continent cannot have one language. You cannot impose it – and for
thirty years, forty years continuously, they have been trying. English
remains the national language and there is no hope of an Indian national
language ever.</p><p><br></p><p>I told that old man, “Just see the facts.”</p><p>But certainly politicians don’t have brains.</p><p><br></p><p>In India I knew many politicians, but I have not seen any brains in
them.</p><p><br></p><p>Simple things that anybody will understand, things which don’t need
great genius, politicians will miss. One of my friends was
commander-in-chief of the Indian armies. When Pakistan invaded India,
this man – his name was General Chaudhuri – asked permission of the
prime minister to counter attack; it was needed, just being defensive
would not help. That’s a simple military strategy: if you become
defensive you are already defeated; the best way is to be
aggressive.</p><p><br></p><p>If Pakistan has invaded one part of Kashmir, Chaudhuris idea was that
we invade Pakistan from four or five fronts. They will be confused, they
will run amok; they will not be able to decide where they have to send
their armies. Their attack will become a failure because they have to
defend all the borders of their country.</p><p><br></p><p>But politicians. The prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, informed him,
“Wait till six o’clock in the morning.”</p><p><br></p><p>General Chaudhuri told me that he was thrown out of the army – not
publicly: publicly he retired honorably, but he was kicked out. He was
told, “Either you resign or we will throw you out.”</p><p><br></p><p>The reason was that he attacked Pakistan at five o’clock in the
morning, one hour before the order. That was the right time; by six
o’clock it would be sunrise, people would be awake. Five o’clock was the
perfectly right time – everybody was asleep – to drive them crazy. And
he did what he was saying – he made the whole of Pakistan tremble. He
was just fifteen miles from Pakistan’s biggest city, Lahore.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole night Jawaharlal and his cabinet were discussing this way
and that way, to do it or not to do it. And even by six o’clock in the
morning they had not come to any conclusion; they just heard on the
radio that “General Chaudhuri is entering Lahore.”</p><p><br></p><p>That was too much for the politicians. They stopped him just fifteen
miles away from Lahore. And I can see that was sheer stupidity. If the
man had taken Lahore, the problem of Kashmir and India would have been
solved forever. It is not ever going to be solved, the problem of the
territory of Kashmir which Pakistan has occupied – and it was because
General Chaudhuri was told to come back, “because India is a non-violent
country and you did not wait for the order.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said to them, “I do understand military strategy; you don’t. Even
by six o’clock – where was your order? Pakistan has already occupied a
certain territory, the most beautiful part of Kashmir – and you were
just discussing the whole night. This is not a question to be discussed,
this has to be decided in the warfield. If you had allowed me to take
over Lahore then we would have been in a position to bargain. Now we are
not in a position to bargain. You pulled me back, I had to come
back.”</p><p><br></p><p>The U.N. decided for a cease-fire line. So now for forty years, U.N.
armies have been there patrolling; on the other side Pakistans armies
are patrolling, on this side Indian armies are patrolling. For forty
years – just nonsense! And in the UNO they go on discussing and nothing
comes out of it.</p><p>And the territory that has been occupied by Pakistan you cannot take
back because of the cease- fire. They have really decided in their
parliament that the territory occupied by them is combined with
Pakistan. Now they show it on their maps. It is no longer occupied
territory, it is Pakistan’s territory.</p><p><br></p><p>I had told General Chaudhuri, “This was such a simple thing, that you
have to be in a bargaining position. If you had taken Lahore they would
have immediately agreed to leave Kashmir because they could not lose
Lahore. Or if a cease-fire was to come, okay, then Lahore remains with
us when we cease fire. Either way there will be something to bargain.
India doesn’t have anything to bargain with – why should Pakistan
bother?”</p><p><br></p><p>But politicians certainly don’t have brains.</p><p><br></p><p>I was thinking that perhaps this is applicable only to Indian
politicians, but coming to Oregon I was really surprised because I saw
greater idiots.</p><p><br></p><p>Just the other day Oregon’s assembly decided that the post office of
the City of Rajneesh will continue to be called the post office of
Antelope. Now can you see the foolishness? Antelope is dead; there is no
longer any Antelope anywhere, the people of Antelope buried it. But the
post office should be called the post office of Antelope.</p><p><br></p><p>The city is called the City of Rajneesh. It has no post office. The
real, the living city, has no post office; the dead, the unreal city has
the post office. And naturally the postmaster goes on rejecting all mail
that comes in the name of the City of Rajneesh because it is the post
office of Antelope. Can you think these politician have brains?</p><p><br></p><p>If they wanted to destroy the City of Rajneesh they should have had
the guts, and they should have resolved in the assembly that the City of
Rajneesh should be again called Antelope. That would have been logical,
and the post office would certainly be the post office of Antelope. Or
they should have changed the name of the post office.</p><p><br></p><p>Both were logical. But what they have done – the city they cannot
touch because it is against the constitution. The people of the city
have changed the name. They have the right to change the name; that is
their constitutional right. The majority decided to change it, and the
assembly cannot interfere.</p><p><br></p><p>But those idiots think that they can at least save the post office,
the post office of Antelope – and nobody in that assembly asked, “When
the city is no longer there ... how can there be a post office of a city
which is non-existential?” And this is going to create unnecessary
problems.</p><p><br></p><p>I would like my people to go to court first against the postmaster
general of America – because it is just a simple rule that whenever a
city changes its name, within one month the post office has to change
its name. But a year has passed and we have been asking the postmaster
general and he has been delaying. He must have been waiting for these
politicians to decide in the assembly.</p><p><br></p><p>So first go against the postmaster general, asking why he delayed for
one year when the simple rule is one month. And who is he to decide that
the post office should continue to be called Antelope’s</p><p>post office? Then go against the assembly also; their decision is
stupid. Either change the name of the city if you have guts – go against
the constitution – or if you don’t have guts then let the post office
name be changed.</p><p><br></p><p>But politicians don’t show any sign of brains.</p><p><br></p><p>I am reminded of a story. A great politician had developed a tumor in
his brain, perhaps a canceric growth. It was a very complicated
operation, his whole brain had to be taken out. He was lying down on the
table; it was a long and very delicate operation. The doctors were
operating on the brain in another room. When the operation was over,
they came back to take the politician ... he was missing! “My God, where
has he gone?”</p><p><br></p><p>The nurse said, “A man came running and he said, ‘You have been
chosen the president.’ The patient stood up and started walking. I tried
to prevent him, I said, ‘Your brain is in the surgery, and they are
working on it.’ He said, ‘Now that I am the president I don’t need the
brain. Let them work on it. Whenever I need it I will come, but at least
for five years forget all about it. I am the president; brains are
needed by small people, nobodies. Where is the need for brains for a man
who has risen to the highest post?’”</p><p><br></p><p>The whole of history proves it, that politicians have been the most
idiotic people around. But the strange fact is that the more idiotic the
politician is, the more possibility there is for his success. That’s
what happened in Adolf Hitler’s case.</p><p><br></p><p>Perhaps Adolf Hitler was the most idiotic politician ever, but he
went on succeeding. He went on conquering countries. It was an amazing
phenomenon. The reason is very strange. He knew nothing of military
science – that was the reason for his success. His generals would tell
him that this is absolutely wrong, this step is absolutely wrong.</p><p><br></p><p>But he never listened to the generals, he listened to the
astrologers. He had his astrologers who said, “This is the right time –
move into France, move into Poland, or move anywhere.” That was decided
by the astrologers and the stars, not by military science. Naturally he
baffled everybody. If he had moved according to military science, then
on the other side the same military science is known.</p><p><br></p><p>If he had bombed London according to military science, then London
would have been ready and prepared. But it was being decided by the
stars, by an idiot astrologer. His generals were absolutely impotent.
They could see that this was nonsense, but this nonsense was succeeding
so they also slowly slowly became silent: “Perhaps he is right.”</p><p><br></p><p>You will be surprised that Churchill had to call astrologers from
India – because Western astrology is different from Eastern astrology.
These are just fictions, so there can be as many astrologies as you
want. Stars don’t care about you, so you can manage anything. They don’t
object either, they don’t have any idea that you are here.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard: one elephant was passing across a bridge and a small
fly was sitting on top of the head of the elephant. When they were just
in the middle of the bridge – the bridge was not made for elephants to
cross; it was a poor village, and a poor bridge temporarily made for the
rainy season – the bridge started shaking. The fly said, “Uncle, our
weight is too much.”</p><p>The elephant heard some buzzing noise. He said, “Just say it loudly –
who are you? And where are you?”</p><p><br></p><p>The fly said, “I am just sitting on your head and our weight is too
much.”</p><p><br></p><p>The elephant said, “My God, I was not even aware that you were here.”
But the fly included itself; He said, “Our weight is shaking the
bridge.”</p><p><br></p><p>Man is not even a fly so far as stars are concerned. And people are
such ... they ask the astrologers, “What time will it be good to start a
business; are the stars in the right position? When will it be good to
get married; are the stars in the right position?” All stars are in the
right position – but all marriages are in the wrong position. This is
enough proof that stars don’t care about you, they don’t know about you.
But you can create fictions. Churchill did not ask the Western
astrologers because they would give him the same advice as was being
given to Adolf Hitler. That wouldn’t be the right thing. Churchill
understood why this man was succeeding. He was succeeding because
whenever they expected him to attack, he never attacked. And whenever
they never expected, could never conceive, there he attacked.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a simple rule of war that you attack at the weakest point. It
is so obvious; you don’t attack the enemy at his strongest point. But
those astrologers don’t know what is a weak point and what is a strong
point. They look towards the stars – and the stars have no idea that
there is a war going on.</p><p><br></p><p>He called those astrologers from India; the war took a turn, because
now Churchill was also functioning like a fool. He was also no longer
listening to his generals. He said, “You keep out of it – because that
man is mad. He knows no military science and it is not going to help.
Now astrology is going to help.” And astrology did help. Poor Adolf
Hitler was defeated. He was succeeding because of astrology – he was
defeated because of astrology.</p><p><br></p><p>But the man was absolutely an idiot about everything. When Germany
started retreating, the generals would not inform him, “We are being
defeated,” because any general who said that would be shot immediately.
Adolf Hitler could not be defeated, so this general must have gone
mad.”</p><p><br></p><p>When the bombs were falling on Berlin itself, just outside the house
where Adolf Hitler was living in the basement, then too the German radio
continued to say that “we are winning all over the world.” Nobody was
ready to get shot unnecessarily – what was the point? This man was not
going to listen.</p><p><br></p><p>Adolf Hitler thought himself almost a demigod. His word was the law,
and if he said that he was going to conquer the world, it was going to
happen. The bombs were falling outside his house; he could hear the
buildings falling, people crying, the noise, the explosions, still he
was consulting the astrologers: “Which country are we going to invade
next?” To the very last moment he was convinced he was winning. Can you
think that a man who has a little bit of brain would be so thick?</p><p><br></p><p>But other politicians are not different either – maybe more of less,
but the brain is not the business of the politician. The politician has
to be stubborn, adamant, fanatic; these are the qualities that make him
succeed. He has to be foolish enough to believe that he has, by birth, a
determined future, a destiny. He is the man of destiny. Only fools can
believe that.</p><p>The more intelligent you are, the less stubborn, the less fanatic;
more thinking, doubting, more skeptical. Skeptical about yourself – you
cannot think of yourself as a man of destiny. You cannot think that you
are born to dominate the world.</p><p><br></p><p>And these people are what our whole history is about. Our whole
history needs to be burned, completely burned, erased. We should start
writing from ABC again, because this history is being taught to every
child. And these people are called Alexander the Great, Genghis the
Great Khan, Ivan the Terrible – and they are praised, their qualities
are praised. And much of the praise is just fiction because those
histories were written by their court clerks. Those court clerks who
were writing those histories were paid. The better the praise, the more
they were paid.</p><p><br></p><p>One of the great emperors in India was Akbar. He was making a new
capital. He wanted to shift the capital from Delhi to a fresh capital,
completely newly-made. His whole life he poured as much money into it as
possible – and he created a city, Fateh-pur Sikri – a beautiful city,
almost a miracle city. All stonework .…</p><p><br></p><p>He gathered all the best stone artists and craftsmen from the world,
and the best stones, marble. He made the whole city his whole life.
Nobody has ever lived in it, because to create a capital so that the
whole of Delhi could be shifted in just a single move<span class=s4></span>Akbar died and Fateh-pur Sikri remains</p><p>incomplete, although a vast city. So much money wasted, such huge and
beautiful buildings, each inch a piece of art – but for what? Nobody has
ever lived there. Nobody is going to live there ever, for the simple
reason that when the city was made nobody thought of water. Nobody
thought that many more things are needed when people live there – land
is needed for crops .…</p><p><br></p><p>It is a very weird experience to be in Fateh-pur Sikri, a city made
with so much money. I think no other city has ever been made in that way
– and nobody ever lived in it. It was a ghost town from the very
beginning, and it is going to remain a ghost town.</p><p><br></p><p>Even now thousands of people can be accommodated there, but other
necessities are not available. And Akbar never went there to see what
was happening. He wanted to wait for it to be completed; then he would
go there. Akbar is thought to have been one of the intelligent emperors,
but I don’t think so. What kind of intelligence is this?</p><p><br></p><p>There was another Mohammedan emperor who almost surpassed Akbar. He
simply ordered the whole of Delhi to move – from Delhi thousands of
miles away to Aurangabad. Aurangabad was very close to Poona.</p><p><br></p><p>Now his order had to be followed, the whole city had to be emptied
immediately. It was a military operation. Everybody was thrown out of
his house; the whole of Delhi was emptied – almost half a million people
moving thousands of miles, not knowing what was going to happen in
Aurangabad. And nothing was prepared there!</p><p><br></p><p>At least Akbar had planned the city, made the city. Aurangabad was a
small place. Where were these people going to live? And nobody bothered
about their food supply for this whole journey. It took months; almost
eighty percent of the people died, twenty percent reached Aurangabad.
And you can think in what condition they were if eighty percent died on
the way.</p><p>Those twenty percent had become sick, old. The journey took at least
ten years from their life. They were utterly wiped out – in fact,
feeling jealous of those who had died, because it was so terrible to
live. And then in Aurangabad there was no space and that idiot king
said, “No, this is not the right place – we should go back.” The whole
journey again! This man’s name was Muhammad Tughlak.</p><p><br></p><p>Do you think these type of people have any brains? By the time they
reached Delhi almost everybody was dead. Delhi was empty; it became a
military camp. And all this for no reason at all! The only reason was
that Muhammad Tughlak’s father had died in Aurangabad and he wanted
Aurangabad to be made the capital of India in his memory.</p><p><br></p><p>But to make a capital for half a million people, to move them
thousands of miles – and trains were not there, buses were not there.
People were moving by foot, on camels, on horses, on donkeys, on bullock
carts. And nobody bothered about how the food was to be managed for the
whole journey, how water was to be managed<span class=s4></span>And
they had to pass through the whole desert of Rajasthan,</p><p>where most of the people died, just because of thirst.</p><p><br></p><p>If you look at history you will be surprised – why do we go on
teaching these people’s lives to our children, why do we contaminate our
children? What is the point?</p><p><br></p><p>I feel that politics and politicians should be completely debarred as
far as the education of the new generation is concerned. The new
generation should be helped to forget the whole past so they can start
living anew.</p><p><br></p><p>There is a saying that history repeats itself. Yes, it repeats itself
because you go on teaching it. Just stop teaching history and it won’t
repeat any more.</p><p>You teach it, you poison the minds of children, and they start having
political ambitions themselves. You make them ambitious. In every
possible way you make them ambitious.</p><p>Your whole education system is not to make children intelligent but
to make them ambitious. Yes, you try to make them intellectuals – that
too is a help for being ambitious.</p><p>If they are intelligent they won’t be ambitious at all. If they are
intelligent they would like to live a very simple and ordinary life in
tune with nature, in harmony with existence, with trees, with birds,
with animals, with people. They would not like to dominate anyone or be
dominated by anyone. They would like to live together in friendliness,
not as masters or slaves.</p><p><br></p><p>There can never be a friendship between the owner and the owned, the
boss and the servant, the leader and the led. There can never be any
friendship. Friendship can happen only when there is a very subtle
undeclared form of equality – not the equality communism talks about,
because that is politics, that is forced equality.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard<span class=s4></span>there was a very strange Greek
king who had a very beautiful, very precious, golden</p><p>bed, made of twenty-four carat gold, studded with diamonds and all
kinds of precious stones. It was</p><p>kept only for guests. But whosoever was unfortunate enough to be his
guest never came out of the King’s guest house alive because he was
determined on one point: the guest had to fit his bed. His bed was so
precious that if the guest was a little longer, then cut his feet off;
if needed, cut off his head – but make him to the size of the bed. If he
was a little smaller, then stretch him. Perhaps this king was the man
who invented traction.</p><p><br></p><p>They used traction on me. When I first heard about traction I started
wondering, from where does this word “traction” come? I found that it
comes from Christian churches of the Middle Ages where they used to
torture people, pulling them from both sides – hands on one side, legs
on the other – to confess that they were in contact with devils, with
witches, that nuns were having intercourse with the devil, that monks
were having intercourse with ghosts ... all kinds of things. And unless
you confessed, this traction would continue.</p><p><br></p><p>It was by chance that a monk had a bad back; and when they did this
traction to him, he confessed, and he also said, “One thing more: my
back was bad and I have been suffering for years; your traction has been
a great blessing to me. I am grateful; my back is perfectly okay, I can
walk!” That’s how this traction came – it is a religious device used by
medical science.</p><p><br></p><p>But that Greek king was even more ancient, he was really the pioneer.
People got killed in both cases, because it was very, very difficult to
find a person exactly the same size as his bed. And he was a king – no
ordinary person was going to be his guest, only very extraordinary
people.</p><p><br></p><p>The bed was not made according to anybody’s size, so everybody was
either too long or too short. Everybody came out dead in the morning.
From his guest house nobody came back alive because he never could find
a man who could fit his bed. And the bed was so precious that people’s
lives did not matter at all.</p><p><br></p><p>These people have dominated humanity – they are still dominating
humanity. Their whole game is one of retarded minds.</p><p>It is time we burned the whole of history and started from the very
beginning, fresh. That’s my whole work with you.</p><p>Talking to you I am really trying to burn your conditionings, trying
to remove all the rubbish that you have been carrying your whole life
... just trying to clean you and make you utterly blank so that you can
start sprouting your self – otherwise you are so full of junk that there
is no space for your self.</p><p><br></p><p>I used to stay in a very rich man’s house in Indore. The man was
certainly one of the richest men in the world. I don’t know anybody who
has been given as many titles as that man. In India Seth is a title
which is given to super-rich people. He was called Sir Seth, not just
ordinary Seth, Seth of the Seths: Sir Seth means above the head, the
chief. And he was the only man who has ever been called Sir Seth in the
whole of history.</p><p><br></p><p>And he had so many titles .… When you saw his letterhead, you could
not believe it: Sir Seth, Raoraja Sir, knight and whatnot; everything
was there. And he had a huge palace, but so full of junk</p><p>– precious junk, but junk after all, is junk. Everything that came
into the market anywhere in the world was immediately purchased, and
things went on gathering in his palace.</p><p><br></p><p>He asked me, “How do you like it?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I just wonder if I can get out of this palace alive, because
there is no space to live in this place. You cannot move!” I took him to
my bedroom, that was his best room. I said, “You just look</p><p>– you move anywhere and you stumble into something.” All models of
television, all models of radio were there, and I said, “Television has
not come to Indore yet – why possess these sets?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “That is my order to all of my offices around the world:
anything new, purchase immediately for the palace.”</p><p><br></p><p>Useless models of television sets ... I said to him, “One day I would
like to go around your whole palace with you, because if this is the
situation of the guest house, I would like to know what the situation of
the host is. It must be worse.” And it was.</p><p><br></p><p>This guest house was a small house in the garden; between the garden
and the palace there were beautiful fountains and trees and lawns, and
then his palace. The first floor was full of horses! I said, “My God! Do
you like riding?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “No.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Then what are these horses doing here?” – and such beautiful
horses I have never seen.</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Just my orders. Anywhere, any beautiful horse, immediately
it has to be purchased.” Rare horses I have seen but nothing to be
compared to Sir Hukumchand’s horses. Then elephants in one corner; in
another corner, camels – and they stink!</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Sir Seth, you must be going crazy with all this stink.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “No; in fact I have become so accustomed to it I don’t go
anywhere because I can’t sleep without this fragrance.”</p><p><br></p><p>He had to feel that in the whole world he was the only man – that was
his liking. He wanted, in everything, to be at the top. He had one Rolls
Royce made of solid gold; it is still there. It was useless because he
was afraid to take it out – it was dangerous. It was too costly – all
solid gold, completely; even the mechanism inside was solid gold. It
never moved, it simply remained in a showcase.</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “What is the point?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “The point is that I am the only person in the whole
world<span class=s4></span>”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “That is very easy, it can be done in a very simple way. Just
shave half your hair, and you will be the only man in the whole world
with half the head shaved. Why waste so much money? Just cut half of
your moustache and you will be a walking exhibition. This car is stuck
here – people have</p><p>come to see it. They will not need to come anymore. You go to the
temple, you go to the office; wherever you will go, your half-moustache
will declare that you are the only man in the whole world</p><p>.…</p><p><br></p><p>The palace was three-storied – not even space to go into the rooms
which were fully packed with strange things; even he had no idea what
they were, but they had been purchased because they had come new in the
market.</p><p><br></p><p>I told him, “Sir Seth, your palace represents exactly the mind of
people. You have money so you can fill your palace with all kinds of
junk. People don’t have that much money so they fill their minds – that
is cheaper – with all kinds of junk.”</p><p><br></p><p>And politicians particularly do this because the politician has to
deal with the lowest mob. He has to descend to the lowest, only then can
he communicate. And slowly slowly he becomes that person – retarded,
mediocre, having a mob psychology. You become that which you go on
practicing continuously.</p><p><br></p><p>You ask me, “Do politicians have brains?”</p><p><br></p><p>I can only say what I have experienced and seen. Certainly the
question will arise, because if I say they don’t have any brains then
how do they go on working? They go on working just like computers, just
like robots. They go on working, not intelligently, but
mechanically.</p><p><br></p><p>Two thousand years of history we know clearly, with evidence. One
thing comes out absolutely clearly, that all political leaders have
functioned mechanically. That’s why history is repeated – because of the
mechanical behavior of the politicians. It is the same wheel that goes
on moving: the same ambition, the same desire, the same strategy, the
same tricks, the same exploitations – and the same results.</p><p><br></p><p>But now the game has come to a point where either the game has to
finish or humanity has to be ready to commit suicide.</p><p><br></p><p>The game is not so precious, the game is just worthless. Humanity
cannot be sacrificed to the political game.</p><p><br></p><p>Human individuals should start declaring that the earth is one, the
whole of humanity is one; that we don’t want any nations, we don’t want
this dirty politics; that we don’t see any problem, why Russia should be
against America, or America be against Russia.</p><p><br></p><p>The Russian people are as innocent and simple as Americans. It is
just the topmost politicians who cannot let you relax, because your
relaxation is their death. They want you to remain continuously tense,
afraid, so that they go on playing the game that “the war is coming and
we have to prepare for it.”</p><p><br></p><p>I want my people to declare that there is going to be no war and we
are not going to be participants in it, that this war is absolute
absurdity.</p><p>And it is good that politics has brought you to this logical
conclusion. Without it there would be no hope of getting rid of
politicians. Now there is a chance, and we should not miss it. It is so
glaringly clear that it is a question of either/or.</p><p><br></p><p>Either the politicians remain or humanity remains.</p><p><br></p><p>And this is where politicians themselves have dragged us. They cannot
back out, there is no way back. Life only goes on forwards, never
backwards. And they are all pushing towards war – reluctantly, afraid,
because they are going to be killed in it themselves.</p><p><br></p><p>It is time that consciousness be raised, that people be made alert
and aware that the question is no longer of communism or democracy,
Russia or America; the question is politics, or religion. And when I say
religion I don’t mean religions. When I say religion I mean
religiousness.</p><p><br></p><p>The religions are all fictitious.</p><p><br></p><p>Just the other day I was talking to you about three fools visiting at
the birth of Jesus Christ, coming from the East to touch his feet. But
the story is so fictitious that I would like you to be reminded of one
thing: what led them to the place where Jesus was born, in an unknown
corner of Bethlehem, in a stable?</p><p><br></p><p>The story says that a great star led the way. They followed the star
and then the star stopped, just on top of the stable, so they knew Jesus
was there, and they went in. This star makes the whole thing clearly
fictitious, because stars don’t move in a direct line. They don’t move
in any other way than in orbit; every star moves in a circle.</p><p><br></p><p>And the stars are so far away that it would be very difficult to
decide which stable the star was above! They are millions and millions
of miles away. The distance is so great ... but the story sounds as if
the star was just sitting on the roof of the stable; only then would it
have been possible. But do you know, stars are very huge, they cannot
come that low; otherwise the whole earth would be destroyed, with Jesus
Christ included.</p><p><br></p><p>Our sun is a star. It is sixty thousand times bigger than this earth
– and this sun is a very mediocre star. There are stars which you see in
the sky which are millions of times bigger than our sun.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, a star leading the way seems almost like somebody holding a
torch ahead, or a lamp, and then coming to the stable and telling them,
“This is the stable.” Stars can’t do that. They cannot move out of their
orbit – even for Jesus Christ they won’t do it.</p><p><br></p><p>But all religions are fictitious.</p><p><br></p><p>Just as there are science fictions there are religious fictions.</p><p><br></p><p>All holy scriptures are religious fictions, and not of first grade
quality. In fact, they cannot be counted as great literature – only
fragments are great.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, in the whole of the Old Testament, just one small piece
can be counted as literature, all else is rubbish. That small piece is
“The Song of Solomon,” which Jews don’t even want to talk</p><p>about – and that is the only important thing in their whole
scripture! But they want to ignore it for the simple reason that Solomon
certainly seems to be a wise man, certainly a religious man; a man of
tremendous sensibility, aesthetic, moral; a man who knows what beauty
is, what poetry is.</p><p><br></p><p>Except for that small piece, everything else is only worth burning.
In the New Testament, just a small piece, “The Sermon on the Mount,” is
enough for Jesus to be counted as a man of some worth. All else is just
written for the mob. The same is true about other religions.</p><p><br></p><p>So when I say religion I simply mean the religious consciousness: a
certain quality – not a certain dogma, not a creed, not a cult, not
something organized but something felt deep in the heart, something
closer to when you see in the morning a beautiful sunrise .… You feel
something, something is stirred in you. You cannot express it, you
cannot tell anybody what you are feeling. All you can do is, you can
hold the other person, and with your finger you can show the sunrise
without saying a single word.</p><p><br></p><p>If the man has any aesthetic sense, any sensibility, he may be able
to feel it; otherwise there is no way. You cannot argue, you cannot make
a statement, you cannot do a commentary. You can only point it out ...
fingers pointing to the moon.</p><p><br></p><p>All religious sages have only pointed to the moon. And all organized
religions have caught hold of the fingers, forgotten all about the moon,
and are worshiping the fingers. Now, the fingers are not the moon – they
never were.</p><p><br></p><p>In Kashmir there is one hair of Hazrat Mohammed which is worshipped.
A few years ago, the hair was stolen. Now there was great turmoil; riots
happened, because certainly some Hindu must have stolen it. Many people
were killed, many houses were burned, many temples destroyed, many
mosques were burned. And after three days the hair was found back in its
place. I know for certain it is not the same hair.</p><p><br></p><p>But what difference does it make? To the idiots ... who knows whether
the first hair was of Hazrat Mohammed or not? And even if it was of
Hazrat Mohammed, what does it matter?</p><p><br></p><p>In Kandi in Ceylon there is a huge temple, one of the most important
in Ceylon – important because it has one too of Gautam Buddha. I have
been to Kandi. The tooth is not of Gautam Buddha, for the simple reason
that it is not a human tooth at all! It is so big – and I got it
confirmed from people who understand animals, man. I had taken a vet
with me. He said, “It is certainly of some animal; it cannot be of a man
in any way.”</p><p><br></p><p>And now it is confirmed by other sources also that it is from some
animal. But it makes no difference; every year the festival continues,
millions of Buddhists go on worshipping.</p><p><br></p><p>Organized religion clings to fingers. Fingers are not in the
moon.</p><p>If you really want to see the moon you will have to forget the
fingers completely; otherwise fingers will come in between you and the
moon. They have to be ignored. They have done their work, they have
indicated; say goodbye to them.</p><p>Religious consciousness is a receptivity, a vulnerability to the
existence that surrounds you, so alive that if you are open, its living
vibes start moving within you, dancing within you. It is so full of joy
– just you are closed. It is overflowing with bliss – just you are not
there to receive it.</p><p><br></p><p>Religious consciousness means receptivity to the joy the universe is
made of. Yes, that is the stuff the universe is made of.</p><p>Any intelligent person is of necessity going to be religious.</p><p><br></p><p>Politics is only for idiots. Its day is finished. We have to begin a
new history in which there will be no place for politics. We want to get
rid of all this retardedness, this mediocrity. We want the earth to
become really the very cream of the whole universe. It can become, it
has the potential. Unfortunately we have not used it. But the time has
come – and I am preparing you to use it.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part27>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

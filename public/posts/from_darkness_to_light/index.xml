‌CHAPTER 1
Who says humanity needs saving?
28 February 1985 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
HOW CAN WE SAVE HUMANITY FROM FALLING EVEN MORE?
It is one of the trade secrets of all the religions to propose propaganda that humanity has to be saved.
It is a very strange idea, but it is so old that nobody seems to look into the implications.</description>

‌CHAPTER 10
Not spiritual guidance but spiritual presence
9 March 1985 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
IS NOT SPIRITUAL GUIDANCE AN ABSOLUTE NECESSITY FOR HUMAN GROWTH?
There are no absolutes in real life – including this statement too. Life is full of exceptions; that’s one of its most beautiful things. Exceptions mean freedom. Exceptions mean you are not in a concentration camp.</description>

‌CHAPTER 11
Science and religion – two petals of the same rose
11 March 1985 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
ISN’T A SYNTHESIS BETWEEN SCIENCE AND RELIGION NEEDED?
The very idea of synthesis already accepts that they are not only two but opposed to each other. Unless there is an antithesis there is no question of synthesis at all.</description>

‌CHAPTER 12
A single humanity rejoicing
12 March 1985 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
THE EUROPEAN PEOPLE HAVE BEEN WORRIED ABOUT EASTERN RELIGIONS, WORRIED THAT THEIR VITALITY CAN DESTROY THE NATIONS. IS THERE THIS DANGER/BLESSING WITH YOUR RELIGION TOO?
Religion is not geography. It is neither Eastern nor Western. It cannot be divided in such a stupid manner; otherwise there will be a Southern religion, a Northern religion, and there will be no end to these divisions.</description>

‌CHAPTER 13
Truth is found in your own boutique
13 March 1985 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
WHY SHOULD RELIGION AND STATE REMAIN SEPARATE?
Religion as such does not exist yet; hence, whatever is known as religion should remain separate from the state for the simple reason that it is not religion – it is pseudo, fake.
You cannot ask the same question in reference to science.</description>

‌CHAPTER 14
The best government is no government
14 March 1985 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
WHAT IS THE BEST GOVERNMENT?
No government.
The very idea of somebody governing somebody else is inhuman. Government is a game, the ugliest and the dirtiest game in the world.
But there are people in the lowest state of consciousness who enjoy it: these are the politicians.</description>

‌CHAPTER 15
The sweet taste of corruption
15 March 1985 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
THE OTHER DAY I GAVE A TALK AT A COLLEGE WHERE A MIDDLE-AGED MAN IN THE AUDIENCE, VISIBLY UPSET, SAID, “BY SPEAKING AGAINST GOD, AGAINST CHRISTIANITY, AGAINST ALL RELIGIONS, YOU ARE CORRUPTING THE MINDS OF THESE YOUNG PEOPLE.” WOULD YOU LIKE TO COMMENT?
I have never spoken against God for the simple reason that God does not exist.</description>

‌CHAPTER 16
Till you live life totally
16 March 1985 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
WHAT IS THE GOAL OF LIFE? WHY IS THERE A DESIRE TO CONTINUE TO LIVE FOREVER?
There is no goal of life, for the simple reason that life is its own goal. The goal is intrinsic, not something outside; not there, far away, but herenow, in this very moment.</description>

‌CHAPTER 17
Love is a very unscientific idea
17 March 1985 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
I HAVE HEARD YOU SAY THAT SCIENTISTS ARE ONLY NOW DISCOVERING THINGS THAT PEOPLE IN THE EAST KNEW FIVE THOUSAND YEARS AGO. HOW DID WE COME TO GO BACKWARDS?
Science as such has no intrinsic value like life, like love, like blissfulness. These are ends in themselves.</description>

‌CHAPTER 18
Meditation: the door from slavery to freedom
18 March 1985 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
MODERN SCIENCE HAS DISCOVERED A NUMBER OF LAWS SUCH AS THE LAW OF GRAVITY, WHICH DESCRIBE THE BEHAVIOR OF THE MATERIAL WORLD. DOES THE SCIENCE OF THE INNER SOUL ALSO HAVE LAWS WHICH APPLY TO CONSCIOUSNESS AND BEING?
It is one of the most fundamental differences between the outer and the inner.</description>

‌CHAPTER 19
Where nothing is right and nothing is wrong
19 March 1985 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
YOU HAVE SAID THAT RIGHT AND WRONG ARE DETERMINED BY EACH SOCIETY. IS THERE NO UNIVERSAL RIGHT AND WRONG?
There is no possibility of any division between right and wrong on the highest level of universal consciousnesses, for the simple reason that there are no divisions at all.</description>

‌CHAPTER 2
Innocence: the price you pay for the failure of success
1 March 1985 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
HOW DID YOU MANAGE TO STAY WITH YOUR OWN CLARITY AS A CHILD AND NOT LET YOURSELF BECOME INTIMIDATED BY THE GROWN-UPS AROUND YOU? WHERE DID YOU GET THAT COURAGE FROM?
Innocence is courage and clarity both.
There is no need to have courage if you are innocent.</description>

‌CHAPTER 20
Don’t drop – transform!
20 March 1985 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
WHY DO I CLING TO MY MISERY? WHY CAN I NOT DROP IT?
The I, the ego, is not something separate from the misery, that’s why it is absolutely impossible for anyone to drop it. Who is going to drop it? They are not two, the dropper and the dropped.</description>

22 March 1985 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
I HAVE HEARD YOU SAY THAT RELIGION AND POLITICS ARE OPPOSITE DIMENSIONS: A RELIGIOUS MAN CANNOT BE INTERESTED IN POLITICS, AND A POLITICIAN CAN NEVER BECOME RELIGIOUS WHILE REMAINING A POLITICIAN. IF THIS IS TRUE, IS THERE NO CHANCE FOR A BETTER WORLD?</description>

Truth is here but you are not
23 March 1985 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
WHAT IS TRUTH? AND WHATEVER IT IS, WHY ARE MOST PEOPLE NOT INTERESTED IN IT?
The way the question is formed says more than is apparent. The first thing it says is that you are not interested in truth at all. It is strange that sometimes the formulation of the question has much more significance than the question itself.</description>

24 March 1985 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
IF PEOPLE DON’T LIKE WHAT WE ARE DOING, WHY DON’T THEY JUST LEAVE US ALONE TO DO IT?
There are many reasons for it, and of great importance. First; why do people not like what we are doing here? It is none of their concern in fact.</description>

25 March 1985 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
I HAVE HEARD YOU SAY THAT TRIBES WHICH ARE NOT SEX-REPRESSIVE REMAIN POOR, AND SOCIETIES WHICH ARE SEX-REPRESSIVE BECOME RICH AND CREATIVE. OSHO, YOUR COMMUNES ARE NOT SEX-REPRESSIVE AND YET THEY ARE RICH AND CREATIVE. CAN YOU COMMENT?
It is one of the most sensitive areas of life because it is concerned with the very life force – sex.</description>

26 March 1985 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
I KNOW IT IS CERTAIN THAT ONE DAY I AM GOING TO DIE, BUT I DON’T FEEL ANY FEAR – WHY?
It is not something exceptional, it is almost the rule. Nobody is afraid of death; otherwise living will become impossible. There is a natural safety measure, and that is something of a very basic nature to be understood.</description>

Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
HISTORY SHOWS THAT WHEN A GREAT MASTER APPEARS ON THE EARTH, OTHER, LESSER LEADERS RECOGNIZE HIM AND BRING THEIR FOLLOWERS WITH THEM. DO YOU SEE THIS HAPPENING HERE?
It has never happened, and it cannot ever happen either. There is a fundamental reason why it cannot happen.</description>

28 March 1985 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
WHY HAS IT HAPPENED THAT IN THE EAST, RELIGION CAME TO ITS HIGHEST FLOWERING, AND IN THE WEST THE SAME HAS HAPPENED TO SCIENCE? IS THERE SOME DIFFERENCE OF CONSCIOUSNESS BETWEEN THE EASTERN MAN AND THE WESTERN MAN?
Consciousness is one and can only be one.</description>

29 March 1985 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
DO POLITICIANS HAVE BRAINS?
I am sorry, but I doubt it. If one has brains there are so many beautiful things in life to do; it is impossible for such a man to be interested in politics at all. Politics is for the lowest category of intellect.</description>

History has moved, up to now, in circles. That is what is meant when it is said that history repeats itself.</description>

2 March 1985 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
WHAT IS THE RIGHT WAY TO HELP A CHILD GROW WITHOUT INTERFERING IN HIS NATURAL POTENTIALITY?
Every way to help a child is wrong. The very idea of helping is not right.
The child needs your love, not your help.
The child needs nourishment, support, but not your help.</description>

DOES A PAGAN LIVING A NATURAL LIFE NEED RELIGION?
It is one of the most basic questions that can be asked. The first thing to understand is, who is a pagan? It is not what Christians go on calling a pagan. The pagan is a natural man – sincere, not a hypocrite, living life naturally without an domination of the mind.</description>

The death penalty is a degrading proof of man’s inhumanity to man. It shows that man is still living in the barbarous age. Civilization still remains an idea – it has not become a reality.</description>

HOW COME YOU SPEAK ABOUT POLITICAL LEADERS AND RELIGIOUS LEADERS IN THE SAME TONE – IS THERE NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM?
Fundamentally there is no difference at all. Superficially of course there are differences.
The basic desire to be a leader arises in people who are suffering from an inferiority complex.</description>

Agony is missing yourself, ecstasy is finding yourself
7 March 1985 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
WHAT IS AGONY AND WHAT IS ECSTASY?
The same. They are not opposites as they are understood to be. They are complementaries, intrinsic parts of one organic whole. Neither can exist without the other.
It will be a little difficult to understand because they have always been thought to be polar opposites.</description>

‌CHAPTER 9
Your suffering makes you special
8 March 1985 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
WHY IS IT SO DIFFICULT TO GET RID OF PAIN, MISERY, SUFFERING OR ANGUISH, WHILE KNOWING PERFECTLY WELL THAT ONE HAS JUST TO UNDERSTAND AND DROP THEM?
It is difficult to get rid of pain, misery, and suffering for the simple reason that they have been your companions for your whole life.</description>
